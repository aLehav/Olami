AJR’s new single “Way Less Sad,” was created entirely from the living room of their New York City apartment. In addition to hit songs such as “Bang!” and “Bummerland,” this track, released on Feb. 17, is from the indie-pop band’s much-anticipated upcoming album, “OK ORCHESTRA." The steady but catchy rhythmic voice of the piano, the upbeat clapping, and the quirky, funky melody of the trumpets welcomes the listener to a vivacious, exciting ambiance — creating that beloved head bop-inducing vibe.
The AJR brothers, Adam, Jack, and Ryan Met express that this track in particular has a special meaning in regards to our current pandemic-ridden lives. “So much of last year felt apocalyptic and this year we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Things aren’t back to normal yet but we should be celebrating the small wins, even if they seem trivial,” the band said in an interview with ABC News Radio.
Following the upbeat, confident introduction, the instrumentals tone down and offer a more intimate musical space for the vocals to enter. Jack goes forth to communicate one of the main messages of the song in the first verse:“And I don’t wanna hurt no more/ So I set my bar real low,” expressing the exhaustion of continuously hoping to reach happiness. The lyrics of the subsequent pre-chorus are powerfully relatable: “ I’m a-okay, I’m a-okay/ You say it but you just don’t mean it/You’re so insane, you’re so insane/ Shut up and just enjoy this feeling.” The lyrics acknowledge that it’s really okay to not be okay, that we all aren’t perfectly okay, and that we should not only communicate this but also accept it and be grateful for every small moment of happiness amidst the hardship.
The underlying beat builds up to the chorus, with the re-emergence of the energetic trumpets, “hey-hey-hey’s,” and drum beats. The chorus’ lyrics are honest and optimistic: “ Don’t you love it don’t you love it/ No I ain’t happy yet/ But I’m way less sad.” AJR presents a fresh perspective to our currently melancholic and bleak world, that although we are far from happy, we shouldn’t necessarily feel sad. Instead, we should embrace the gifts of every day, even if they feel small or unimportant.
The rest of the song maintains an uplifting and bright tone, created by the harmonious combination of rhythmic piano, spirited trumpets, underlying drums and bass, and the joining of multiple voices in the chorus. “Way Less Sad'' communicates an incredibly relatable message that speaks to the feeling of struggling to hold on and withstand this prolonged period of social isolation and uncertainty. It reminds us that although life isn’t perfect, the little things that brighten up each day are enough for us to “shut up and just enjoy this feeling.”

It’s 2016, you’re on your way to school, eternally tangled headphones dangling from your ears, mask nowhere to be seen. Life is good.
But it’s about to get even better, because Rapper Kanye West just dropped his seventh studio album, “The Life of Pablo.”
With hit songs like “Famous,” “Ultralight Beam,” and “Fade,” the album quickly climbed up the charts and into party playlists worldwide. The highly anticipated record was shrouded in mysteries, its countless dubious release dates and ambiguous title spurring a hashtag to trend on Twitter long after the album’s rollout. Not to mention, this era of Kanye West has brought us pop culture like no other, filled with various celebrity beef wars and news of Kim Kardashian West being held up at gunpoint in Paris.
While the album’s namesake may remain undecided, its purpose is clear.
“Wolves,” “No More Parties in LA,” and “FML” all have a funky, offbeat style, characteristic of that old ‘Ye that the rapper hints at in the hilarious bop “Love Kanye.” “Pt. 2” redirects the album into more mainstream territory, with Young Thug blasting heavy on the autotune in “Highlights.” Conversely, songs like “Waves” and “Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1” have a more gospel sound to them, hinting at the quintessential Christian lyricism the rapper would grow into all these years later.
Ever the trendsetter, Kanye facilitates the marriage of modern 808’s with old-school synthesizers to create a harmony representative of his multifaceted career. Transitioning between old and new, the mogul flirts with the past and present in a battle of the Kanyes.
Now, five years have gone by in the blink of an eye, and a Trump-endorsing, post-Twitter, scandal-embroiled Kanye is at large. With such a drastic schism in the rapper’s career — and in most aspects of his personal life — a permanent transformation in sound is inevitable.
You don’t have to be a diehard fan to notice that the music Kanye drops today has evolved beyond recognition. Highlighting the production process has always been essential to Kanye’s mission, but his rapping has never fallen far enough behind his instrumentals to hurt that ]mission. In the wake of recent projects, like his latest album “Jesus Is King,” however, some say that this is no longer the case.
Speculations are that his newfound focus on his design collection, Yeezy, along with a renewed devotion to religious worship, have stretched Kanye too thin and led him astray from his sound. The giant strides in his personal life have effectively distanced him from his fans, making his intentions less relevant by the day. As a result, some fans think that the new Kanye is trying too hard to set trends he used to smash back in his day. Others disagree and praise the rapper for his constant ingenuity, whatever form it may take on.
Whatever you may believe, for all intents and purposes, “The Life of Pablo” has immortalized the spirit of the Kanye who was once first and foremost a rapper.

For the members of Couch, a Boston-area band with almost a million Spotify streams, meeting online is all too familiar. Unlike the many students who first downloaded Zoom during the coronavirus pandemic, Couch’s members — college students from different local schools with little time to physically meet — embraced video conferencing a long time ago. The group’s experience ensured that limited in-person contact proved no obstacle to the release of the five new singles in their eponymous first EP on Feb. 26.
Most of the band's members had already met in high school before forming Couch in November 2018. “It began as just a rotating group each song,” says guitarist Zach Blankstein. “We were planning on featuring different musicians. But we had so much fun working on that first single ... We decided to keep this group solidified and move forward with this core.” But the group stayed true to their original intention of exploring different musical styles by featuring different artists and instruments. “We love collaboration,” says Eric A. Tarlin ’21-’22. And Couch’s collaborators seem to love the group just as much, helping defy genres with the individual styles they bring.
“I don't know that it was even necessarily a decision we made to try and experiment with genres,” says vocalist Tema Siegel, who credits the band’s unique sound to the members’ varying musical backgrounds. “We always say that we try to kind of defy the tropes of pop music by infusing it a little more with jazz and funk and soul … We all bring a lot of different musical tastes to the table and it results in that fusion.”
Fusion seems to be a key word for Couch. Influenced by artists from Paul McCartney and Buddy Rich to Charlie Puth and Bruno Mars, Couch’s unique music brings together instruments as different as bass guitar and saxophone to blur the lines between genres, mixing poppy rhythms with jazz, funk, and soul elements.
While this blend proved successful with online listeners, the coronavirus pandemic forced the group to cancel their summer tour, taking away their chance to form the kind of personal, hands-on connections with fans made possible by a physical tour.
While Siegel was disappointed by the lack of normal concerts, she found a bright spot in the hugely successful drive-in concert the band organized over the summer. “I think everybody who was there missed live music, missed getting out and going to see live entertainment. And so it was really exciting for them. But it was also really special for us to know that we could still organize something and connect with an audience of people watching from their cars. They couldn't clap, but they could beep. And it was a really fun time,” Siegel says. The group’s drummer, Jared Gozinsky, agrees: “Since we all really love what we do with Couch, none of it really feels like work anyway,” he says.
Fortunately for the group, similarly serendipitous situations weren’t isolated incidents. “Our single that we just released called Black Bear Lane only happened, it was only written because four of us quarantined in Vermont very early on in the summer, which, of course, only happened because we were in the middle of the global pandemic. That song definitely wouldn't look the way it did, or definitely wouldn't exist at all, if not for COVID,” Danny Silverston says. The pandemic-related challenges of production “led to some experimentation sonically,” says Tarlin. In particular, limited instrumentation options led the band to experiment with blending soul, R&B, and sleek pop. Couch’s early embrace of videoconferencing proved similarly beneficial: “it's sort of just leveled the playing field a little bit between us, who were managing remote collaboration already and bands that were together in person,” Tarlin says.
The group’s current focus is on the release of their EP, with other plans laid out in broad strokes due to the lingering uncertainty of the pandemic. “I think we're in the immediate future really, really excited,” says Siegel, who hopes that the band will meet in person to start new projects this summer. “Definitely live shows whenever it's safe to do, so very much, looking forward to that,” says Tarlin. Gozinsky shares Siegel’s enthusiasm about giving Couch’s tour another try. “I think as soon as it's safe to do so, I think we're going to be all on top of that,” he says. “Well, we're all itching to play.” But no matter what the future brings, the band’s direction, at least to Zach Blankstein, is clear. “Forward. Keep moving forward.”

Ariana Grande is the gift that keeps on giving. After releasing her sixth studio album, Positions, in October, she surprised listeners with even more music by dropping “Positions (Deluxe)” on Feb. 19. This deluxe album contains five new tracks: “someone like u (interlude),” “test drive,” a “34+35” remix featuring Doja Cat & Megan Thee Stallion, “worst behavior,” and “main thing.” Grande’s attempt to quench fans’ unrelenting thirst for new music will surely leave them wanting more than the new two-minute tracks.
Production-wise, given their polished vocals and unique timbres, these songs are at the same level as the original album’s. However, their brevity makes the deluxe album feel rushed, almost as if Grande had meant for these songs to be on the original but then added unfinished versions to the deluxe album. The quality is there, as all five songs definitely had the potential to be bops — if only Grande had extended them past two verses.
“someone like u (interlude)” is a cute one-minute track where Grande repeats the line “I’ve been waiting for someone like you,” revealing a newfound lover is the key to her lock. Without excessive production, harmonies beautifully float above and accentuate her vocals. Interestingly enough, this interlude feels like a wink to “Intro” from her second studio album “My Everything,” giving us a taste from the past and showing her immense growth from then to now with her delicately stacked harmonies and twinkly R&B beats. This interlude, without a doubt, deserved a spot on the original album, either replacing “shut up” or finding its way between “love language” and “positions.”
“test drive” opens with an electric piano, taking listeners back to ’90s R&B. In this song, Grande shows off her great sense of rhythm as her vocals dance around the beat until the chorus, when she says, “No, I don’t feel the need to test drive nothin’.” This song could definitely be a hit and could have had a greater presence on the charts if she had included a third verse and a bridge.
The album closer, “main thing,” nicely sums up the theme of “Positions.” The album is a story in which Grande is trying out a new fling but is scared to go all in due to her fear of the relationship not working out. As the album progresses, so do her growth and assurance that this relationship is the one she has been waiting for. “main thing” confirms this as she sings, “All I wanna do is spend my time with you / even when the learning’s done and nothing’s new.” The song is perfectly executed, but again, it would have been even better if there were another verse and bridge. The tension slowly builds until the chorus and then knocks listeners off their feet as it disappears. The song’s components mimic her emotions: the tension symbolizing the butterflies in her stomach, the bubbly chorus exploring her feelings, and the perfect harmonies oozing with love.
Overall, all the tracks on the deluxe album are consistent with the original, which is often not the case with deluxe albums. In fact, these deluxe tracks could even have taken the place of some disappointing tracks on the original such as “just like magic” and “love language.” Nonetheless, this deluxe album still underwhelms despite its high-quality production. Grande is doing more harm than good by releasing short tracks because they only make listeners want more.

On Feb. 18, as part of the ongoing series “Perspectives on Performance,” Harvard’s Theater, Dance, & Media (TDM) concentration brought in interdisciplinary artist Alison S.M. Kobayashi to discuss her work following the multi-year success of her show “Say Something Bunny!.”
Kobayashi attended the University of Toronto where she found her calling as an artist. She started taking Visual Culture classes in the Communications major and later switched to a degree in Art and Art History. She now works for UnionDocs, a documentary art center in Williamsburg Brooklyn.
Kobayashi has worked in almost all facets of the art world, from filmmaking to digital art, from performance to watercolor. Her show “Say Something Bunny!” is a widely recognized performance art piece that rewrites the gap between performer and audience, inviting audience members to partake in the action and play the characters the show surrounds. Her work finds much inspiration from objects that, as Kobayashi described, are “donated or left behind or forgotten in some way, yet all contained [invaluable] narratives and traces of the human experience.”
Pointing to a clunky cognac brown device on her screen, Kobayashi explained that it was a wire recorder, and that a recording that was made on a machine like it had been the inspiration for her work for many years. “It’s actually sound that's been recorded on wire that's as thin as a piece of hair and the wires that I'm working with, they came as a pair,” Kobayashi said. “They had no labels on them. There was zero contacts, there are no dates or names attached and much of the recording was very difficult to hear and decipher and understand.”
At the event, Kobayashi presented her practice by walking the audience through excerpts of “Say Something Bunny!” and subsequently discussing her methodology and philosophy behind theater. Attendees participated in what Kobayashi called a “deep listening exercise” for one of the show’s characters, Florence. The goal was to decipher Florence’s voice amidst a lively conversation and scratchy audio that was recorded over an old TV show. Shortly after, Kobayashi said, “I listened to each character slowly and I'd account for each voice and each sound. I didn't do this through editing the audio or putting a filter on it. I did this by becoming more familiar with the characters through repetitive listening.”
In an interview, Artistic Producer of TDM James P. Stanley explained that it was her “real forensics approach” that he admired about Kobayashi’s work. Stanley, who teaches the course “Live Art from Archival Sources,” brought in Kobayashi just days before the event to guest lecture. When asked what he took away from the event, Stanley said that “Alison’s process and attitude towards these documents stood out the most… It’s fascinating how she uses a document to open up a narrative.” He described her work as both “rigorous on the one hand, and on the other, Alison treats it with a sort of whimsy,” pointing to how she allowed her audience to play with the material lightheartedly.
Asked in an interview if there were any turning points in either the creation or performance of the show, Kobayashi said, “because there is always a new audience, I’m always adding and changing things to illustrate it more, or make something hit more, which makes it more alive.” She described “Say Something Bunny!” as “both minimalist and maximalist,” because, while the show is ever-changing, the central elements of the show are simple and effective.
Kobayashi’s presentation of her attentive, free-flowing creative process was what drove TDM to invite her in the first place. Stanley said that “the ‘Perspectives on Performance’ series was started in 2016 by [TDM’s] David Levine. It brought in people working on the edges of performance.” Later he explained that TDM’s intention is to invite artists to not just lecture at but to also “work with students and teach their methodologies.”
Ultimately, Kobayashi’s artistic philosophy of letting the material guide the process is “core to what TDM is trying to do,” Stanley says, adding that “over the past four years, we have turned toward process-based work.” Through “Perspectives on Performance with Alison Kobayashi,” the Theater, Dance, & Media program continues to show a strong commitment to expanding on the meaning of art and rewriting what it means to perform.

Did DaBaby just put JoJo Siwa on blast? Out of all the craziness in 2021, most people would not have expected to wonder if there was some unknown tension between the two. As one fan tweeted “dababy having beef with jojo siwa was not on my february bingo card but thats fine im enjoying it.”
In DaBaby’s recently released “Beatbox ‘Freestyle’,” the rapper seemingly takes a swing at the 17-year-old YouTube superstar, holding up a picture of her on his phone as he raps “you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (bitch)” Without a doubt, this line left several listeners a little confused, while others were left angry. Many tweeted things like“what tf did jojo siwa do to make dababy mad like that.”
Despite the outrage and confusion that he faced, DaBaby responded with a series of tweets to dismiss any rumors of a feud with Siwa. In the tweets, he actually seemed to find the situation quite funny[. Amidst the uproar of criticism, the rapper tweeted] “I love Twitter bruh” followed by “I ‘Siwa’ I’m not like the rest of you…” While this set of tweets may seem a bit cryptic at first glance, they reveal that the “diss” line on the track was actually just a play on words. DaBaby’s real name is Jonathan, hence the “JoJo” and he used “Siwa” as a twist on “see why” (which is heard in the previous line of the song “...gon’ see why”).
DaBaby also tweeted directly at Siwa explaining that he meant no harm. He said “@itsjojosiwa my 3 year old princess is your number 1 fan… Don’t let em trick you into ever thinking id have a problem with you. My word play just went over their heads. All love on my end shawty.”
All in all, it seems like there’s no bad blood between JoJo Siwa and DaBaby, just a clever play on words that went way over the Internet’s head — but we have yet to see a response from Siwa herself. In contrast, many of her fans, and even fellow YouTubers like James Charles, are left feeling unsatisfied by DaBaby’s response. In a recent interview, Charles said that he “thought the line was inappropriate to begin with… I get the line, I get the double entendre there.” Charles also mentioned that “as a fellow member of the LGBTQ+ community… I just wanted to make sure that she was okay, taken care of… I just feel like her name should not be associated anywhere with diss tracks.” As Siwa recently made headlines when she came out as a part of the BGLTQ+ community in January, she has since expressed that she’s the happiest she’s ever been, as she’s now been able to share “what makes [her] the happiest with the world.”
So the tea is, there is no tea — and DaBaby may even be a secret JoJo Siwa fan.

Robert Ouyang Rusli is an Asian American musician and film composer. They scored Shatara Michelle Ford’s meditative, haunting debut film “Test Pattern,” which is available for rent now in Kino Lorber virtual cinemas. The film focuses on Renesha and Evan, a mixed-race couple in Austin, Texas; in the wake of Renesha’s sexual assault, the couple runs up against the misogynoir at the foundation of the U.S. healthcare system. The Harvard Crimson spoke to Rusli about their scoring process and craft. The full score is available to stream and purchase on Bandcamp.
The Harvard Crimson: Congratulations on “Test Pattern” finally being out. It's a beautiful film, and this score is stirring.
Robert Ouyang Rusli: Thank you. It was finished in late 2018 or early 2019, [and] reached the right people [at distributor Kino Lorber].
THC: Can you talk about your collaborative process with director Shatara Michelle Ford?
ROR: I met Shatara through a mutual friend, Maegan Houang, who’s also an incredible filmmaker. We all met in LA, and the whole sound team watched the film together and had a spotting session. A lot of the time [in film] I don't even know what the sound design is going to be, so this was really nice. A lot of films I work on, it's very much over the Internet collaboration where I'm sending different cues, then Shatara will take a look and we'll have a conversation. Working with Shatara is really easy because they are very decisive and know what they want, [so they can say] ‘this is the right direction. There's no doubting this.’
Kelsey Lu is where the string inspiration started, [and] there's certain cues that are Jonny Greenwood inspired. I read a Mica Levi interview to set a limitation on your film score palette, which is something I don't usually do. Having this restriction [scoring exclusively with a string quartet] made the creativity ooze out in different directions. [I used] techniques of flipping the bow upside down called col legno, and bouncing it on the string to create this metallic, rhythmic feeling.
THC: I wanted to ask about this beautiful moment that happens near the film’s end. After this harrowing day, it goes to this beautiful flashback where Renesha and Evan are in a backyard, and the music [“Nostalgia”] is swelling and it feels particularly warm.
ROR: We tried really hard to create themes in the music, and so at the beginning there is this theme when they meet and then have their second date in the bedroom — it's very consensual, and the music is romantic.
In the scenes where [Renesha] passes out at the club and gets taken, there's these strings that are fluttering. Those [strings] combine with this theme in that scene in the backyard, and in that context it sounds beautiful. But you also associate it with this darkness earlier. [In the last scored moment] in the film when she's alone in that tub, all you hear is these fluttering strings that just build and build. If you watch it in the theater, which is what I was intending, it's supposed to really swell and just totally overcome. I feel that's just representative of how sexual assault can linger with somebody in different ways — and I tried to do that with the theme that happens there and keeps popping up.
THC: Did you learn that [technique] from any specific composer?
ROR: I learned about storytelling and themes from musical theater. I went to school and studied orchestration and Wagner, the German composer, and he has this thing called leitmotif. He is into very specific cues for certain characters. It’s especially fun in feature films to work with, but it's kind of hard in a short film to develop a theme.
THC: Do you have composers who are currently in your ear?
ROR: My favorite score is Akira, by Geinoh Yamashirogumi. That score is truly incredible. [Also,] Mica Levi. Her score for “Under The Skin” I return to constantly for inspiration. I'm very much inspired by composers that try to be more experimental in their craft. I think Oneohtrix Point Never does really beautiful scores; for “Uncut Gems” he wrote a really beautiful score. Fatima Al Qadiri wrote the score for “Atlantics.” I did really love the “Phantom Thread” score.
THC: How do you see your practice as a film composer overlapping with your [experimental rap] work as OHYUNG?
ROR: A lot of my OHYUNG music [is] very political and challenging whiteness and being very satirical about power structures like capitalism. I was always worried earlier in my career that it would stop me from getting work, and the more that I embraced combining them I just started to get more work and started to work with more people of color. They're still separate by name because film scoring is, at the end of the day, what the director wants. I do think that directors make a score better, from understanding their film so deeply. I do think they are in conversation; a lot of my experimental rap music is very cinematic.
THC: I'm thinking about [the OHYUNG song] “POST RACE WAR GLOW” [as an example].
ROR: Shatara actually heard of my music through my OHYUNG music. They're drawn to musicians that can also write music for films who have their own sound.
THC: What is next that you are feeling anxious to work on?
ROR: I have always wanted to score an animated film, an anime; that has always been a dream of mine. It’s just a joy to score good storytelling, so any film that just tells a story really beautifully I love to do. When I had the time [I would] write a score for “Spa Night” by Andrew Ahn. It doesn’t have any music, but just for fun, I would love to score it to see what it would be like.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may seem unexciting to watch a movie about an archaeological dig that isn’t “Indiana Jones.” Yet, with the truly incredible names on the cast list for “The Dig” — Ralph Fiennes, Carey Mulligan, and Lily James to name a few — and a story that’s heartwarming and insightful, “The Dig” manages to turn seemingly bland subject matter into a compelling narrative.
The film, which is based on a true story, follows an archaeological dig taking place in the backyard of a dying widow, led by an excavator never properly trained in archeology joined by a rag-tag mix of friends and museum curators. With inspiring performances, “The Dig” manages to be a heartwarming and exciting film. Without ever going over the top with theatrics and excitement, it draws the gaze of its audience to every little detail. The well-mannered, pre-WWII English dialogue is thoughtfully accompanied by a swooning musical arrangement, all building toward the creation of the ideal scene.
While telling an almost-lost story about Basil Brown’s (Ralph Fiennes) unexpected finds in the field behind the Pretty’s home, director Simon Stone seems to have finally broken loose in the directing world. Rather than solely dramatizing the eccentricities of such a story, Stone portrays every moment on screen with such genuine humanity that it’s tempting to cry when the characters finally succeed. Conveying their relatable humanity, Basil says, “...we all fail. Every day. There are some things we just can't succeed at no matter how hard we try. I know it's not what you want to hear.” But this film is far from a failure for Simon Stone.
Basil Brown and Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) are portrayed as deeply flawed yet incredibly admirable characters. In their respective lives, each was haunted by horrible demons — Basil bears the crushing weight of never having the opportunity to be educated and to see the results of his work acknowledged, while Edith hides her illness away to act as the stern yet kind matriarch of a fractured family. Regardless of these internal pressures, both managed to do two things right as history would see it. Basil continued his course as a participant in what was once his own significant archeological dig that had since been snatched up by The British Museum. And Edith ensured, to her furthest extent, that Basil would be lauded for his discovery of a buried Anglo-Saxon ship in their own little town of Sutton Hoo.
Luckily, without being too in-your-face, “The Dig” also manages to subtly add to the growing drama of the film using the stress of a slowly developing war. By mounting this pressure in a more non-invasive way, the movie doesn’t become another one of seemingly hundreds of WWII films. Rather, it uses the war as a subplot to emphasize the contrast between the bourgeoisie London museum curators and Basil Brown with the Pretty family. With the constant threat of war looming along with the potential for the Prettys to lose one of their own, the dig is of dire importance to them, whereas the London archaeologists only care about getting new pieces safe in museums before the start of the war.
As the war begins and Germany invades Poland, the dig reaches its pinnacle, and so does the slowly growing subplot about the love between a married woman, Peggy Piggott (Lily James), and a burgeoning pilot, Robert Pretty (Archie Barnes). Peggy’s husband Stuart (Ben Chaplain), won’t dare see his wife naked nor does he even share a bed with her. It slowly becomes clear, without being blatant, that he is most likely gay. Subtle cues throughout the movie seem to hint that Staurt is gay, as many historians have speculated. When he’s knee deep in mud and unearthing millennia-old artifacts alongside his best friend, his face is bright and full of joy. The same doesn’t happen, even as he forces it, with his wife; in reality she is little more than a companion and coworker. What really builds the sense of empathy for the characters is their sense of realism. Peggy truly cares for Stuart, but she knows that romantic feelings can’t be reciprocated. And by never having a scene where there’s a big moment about his coming-out, there’s a sense of acceptance and acknowledgement of his presumed sexuality. It’s who they are and part of the story without being a tag or quick, modern-day bit of neoliberal inclusivity.
In the end, with endearing love stories abounding and visually stunning views of the English countryside, “The Dig” is truly a great film. There’s a little something for everyone to take away and smile about when it ends. Moreover, the story is one that had been buried deep in the annals of The British Museum for decades. The real story of Basil Brown’s discovery of the Anglo-Saxon ship almost went completely without credit. But today, in part due to this film,“the most important single find ever made in this country, and one of outstanding European importance” (R. L. S. Bruce-Mitford) is now going to be well known to future generations.

Did DaBaby just put JoJo Siwa on blast? Out of all the craziness in 2021, most people would not have expected to wonder if there was some unknown tension between the two. As one fan tweeted “dababy having beef with jojo siwa was not on my february bingo card but thats fine im enjoying it.”
In DaBaby’s recently released “Beatbox ‘Freestyle’,” the rapper seemingly takes a swing at the 17-year-old YouTube superstar, holding up a picture of her on his phone as he raps “you a bitch, JoJo Siwa (bitch)” Without a doubt, this line left several listeners a little confused, while others were left angry. Many tweeted things like“what tf did jojo siwa do to make dababy mad like that.”
Despite the outrage and confusion that he faced, DaBaby responded with a series of tweets to dismiss any rumors of a feud with Siwa. In the tweets, he actually seemed to find the situation quite funny. Amidst the uproar of criticism, the rapper tweeted “I love Twitter bruh” followed by “I ‘Siwa’ I’m not like the rest of you…” While this set of tweets may seem a bit cryptic at first glance, they reveal that the “diss” line on the track was actually just a play on words. DaBaby’s real name is Jonathan, hence the “JoJo” and he used “Siwa” as a twist on “see why” (which is heard in the previous line of the song “...gon’ see why”).
DaBaby also tweeted directly at Siwa explaining that he meant no harm. He said “@itsjojosiwa my 3 year old princess is your number 1 fan… Don’t let em trick you into ever thinking id have a problem with you. My word play just went over their heads. All love on my end shawty.”
All in all, it seems like there’s no bad blood between JoJo Siwa and DaBaby, just a clever play on words that went way over the Internet’s head — but we have yet to see a response from Siwa herself. In contrast, many of her fans, and even fellow YouTubers like James Charles, are left feeling unsatisfied by DaBaby’s response. In a recent interview, Charles said that he “thought the line was inappropriate to begin with… I get the line, I get the double entendre there.” Charles also mentioned that “as a fellow member of the LGBTQ+ community… I just wanted to make sure that she was okay, taken care of… I just feel like her name should not be associated anywhere with diss tracks.” As Siwa recently made headlines when she came out as a part of the BGLTQ+ community in January, she has since expressed that she’s the happiest she’s ever been, as she’s now been able to share “what makes [her] the happiest with the world.”
So the tea is, there is no tea — and DaBaby may even be a secret JoJo Siwa fan.

Last week, ahead of the release of “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” on March 18, HBO Max dropped a new trailer. The film, which is a re-release of the 2017 film “Justice League,” promises to feature $70 million worth of new content and be true to Snyder’s original vision — unlike the previous version, which underwent massive changes after Snyder was forced to step down due to personal reasons. The trailer appears to adhere to this premise, featuring both new and old content, and already showing promise of Zack Snyder’s cut being markedly different to the film fans have already seen.
The two-and-a-half minute trailer opens with a swelling choir over Superman’s (Henry Cavill) supposed death scene from “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” before showing a series of shots of a destroyed city. The narration is suitably dramatic, proclaiming that “the God is dead,” as Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielson) watches something fall. The voice sounds like Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) in “Batman v Superman,” who was not present in the original film; with the new film’s runtime of over four hours, however there’s definitely time for a new Luthor subplot.
The narration continues with Batman (Ben Affleck) saying “I had a dream, almost like a premonition,” which unfortunately acts as a reminder of the unholy amount of hallucinations, visions, and dream sequences in “Batman v Superman,” that hopefully will not recur in “Zack Snyder’s Justice League.”
Next, the trailer showcases new footage of the lead characters: a futuristic looking Batman in a desert, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) looking shocked in a long coat, and an interesting shot of Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) — who by himself was the primary antagonist in the original incarnation of “Justice League” — appearing to swear fealty to someone as he promises to attack Earth.
There is a new shot of the Amazons being attacked, and while Queen Hippolyta’s armour looks good, it is unclear whether “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” will fix the glaring sexism in the downgrade of the Amazons’ costumes from functional armor in “Wonder Woman” to glorified bikinis in “Justice League.”
As a reminder that this is not a new movie, there is a sequence of familiar shots introducing each member of the titular Justice League, as well as fight sequences from their first clash with Steppenwolf. There is also a shot that’s trying too hard to be symbolic: a photo of Superman’s dad (Kevin Costner) slowly sinking into the regenerative soup that will presumably be used to resurrect Superman. The resurrection of Superman is sure to still feature heavily, as Alfred (Jeremy Irons) confusingly tells Batman, “If you can’t bring down the charging bull, then don’t wave the red cape at it,” as footage of Superman’s fluttering red cape plays in the background. Surely the concern is that they can’t win without Superman, so therefore they don’t have the red cape? What he means here is unclear.
Superman’s dad’s line from way back in “Man of Steel” also reappears as he narrates: “You were sent here for a reason.” Destiny politics is an interesting route to take in a world containing beings with godly powers, but appears to be a recurring theme in the trailer. After familiar shots of fighting, we get a first glimpse of dark Superman wearing his famous black suit and using his heat vision.
The music swells as we see a series of emotional moments without any context, before a group hug between Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Clark Kent, and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) that directly juxtaposes Superman’s stiff and awkward return home after his resurrection during “Justice League.”
After more shots of fighting, the famous line-up shot of the Justice League appears before more shots of fighting and the main characters using their powers. Despite the plethora of gif-worthy action shots, nothing yet shows how “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” earned its R-rating.
In a dramatic shift from Batman’s guilt and pessimism in the original “Justice League,” here he acts as the voice of hope. One of the biggest failures of “Justice League,” and one of the main reasons it failed to stand aside its Marvel equivalent, “The Avengers,” was that its titular team were not a team — they had no chemistry, no connection, and no reason to stand together other than because it said to in the script. Hopefully, this shift signals an attempt to correct that error.
Finally, the trailer ends with a short surprise sequence of Jared Leto’s Joker quoting the wildly popular edgelord meme, “We live in a society.” It’s curious how they intend to utilize this iteration of the Joker following Leto’s egregious behaviour under the guise of method acting, his character’s minor role as a red herring in the terrible movie that is “Suicide Squad,” and a name-drop plot device in the fantastic “Birds of Prey.” Even considering the lengthy runtime, “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” is already hinting at a crowded roster of antagonists. Considering Steppenwolf’s large role in the original “Justice League,” he was noticeably lacking in the trailer, suggesting either a reduced role or changes Snyder wants to be a surprise — either way, hopefully he will be less of a Mary Sue.
Moreover, since several solo movies have come out and revealed more about the characters since the release of “Justice League” in 2017, it is unknown whether this will be included in “Zack Syder’s Justice League.” Most notably, Batman’s digs at Wonder Woman about not being over Steve Trevor fall particularly flat when a lot of the plot of “Wonder Woman 1984” was about Diana dealing with the loss of Steve.
While it’s great that a creator is having his artistic vision honored, it’s almost unbelievable that Warner Bros. Studios greenlit this project, as it effectively admits culpability in the both on and off-screen mess that was “Justice League.” There is also a surprising amount of fan anticipation in the run up to the release of “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” considering “Justice League” was by no means an outlier in an otherwise masterful line-up of DC superhero movies. And many of those movies, containing story arcs and plot points that were equal parts dumb, ridiculous, or annoying, were led by Snyder himself. Case in point: “MARTHAAA.” There are few creative decisions in a superhero movie stupider than having your hero angstily yell his mother’s given name — an inexplicable choice that accidentally saves his life because his enemy’s murdered mother also happened to have that name. The well-memed scene embodies the DC Extended Universe’s struggle with making concepts they think are cool into functioning, compelling stories.
Regardless, the existence of “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” certainly is something special, and even if it isn’t completely new, it promises to revolutionize the 2017 movie. As the DCEU currently contains an array of terrible movies with a sprinkling of good ones, let’s hope “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” can manage to fall in the second category. At the very least, it can’t be worse than the original “Justice League.”

Maggie Shipstead’s upcoming novel “Great Circle'' is unbelievably expansive both in setting and scope. Set to be released in May 2021 the book combines interwoven narratives circulating around the story of Marian Graves, who, in her valiant attempt to become the first pilot to circumvent the globe north to south over the poles, disappears in Antarctica in 1950. Featuring an ensemble cast of characters from Marian’s past, present, and future, ‘Great Circle’ explores all of the different ways in which we are remembered and our stories are told.
The brilliance of Shipstead’s storytelling is in her character work. The cast of characters in “Great Circle” are intricate and complex in their own right — each being deeply flawed and therefore deeply human. Despite the inherent focus of Marian’s narrative, each supporting role is well developed and distinctly unique in both their personality as well as their motivations. The rotation of perspective ultimately helps propel the reader through what would otherwise be an incredibly long and complex plot.
Though the plotlines come second to the character development, “Great Circle” delves into the gamut of human experience, from romance to war to grief. That being said, there are some parts of this book that drag, and it is a novel that will take time and energy to fully delve into. Especially towards the beginning, where the reader is introduced to so many perspectives, it can be difficult to fully invest in the narrative without a clear understanding as to why each mini-story is important quite yet. Combined with the fact that the novel has a complex non-linear timeline, this story is not instantaneously engrossing, but it builds until it is difficult to put down. To be fair, no other story structure would so cleverly aid the larger ideals at the heart of the novel — that moments matter and influence the events that follow — but the drag in pacing is an unavoidable downside to the novel.
However, despite the particular mode of storytelling, this book is deeply satisfying. The sometimes arduous reading culminates in a completely extraordinary ending. This point is not to say that the ending is neatly tied up in a bow — the finale is just as beautifully messy and bittersweet as the rest of the book — but rather there is such a special sense of fulfillment and completeness that radiates from the conclusion of “Great Circle.” It is a novel that forces its audience to reflect deeply, not only upon their own personal origin stories, but on the many stories that have interwoven to influence their lives.
A particularly disappointing aspect of “Great Circle” comes from its marketing — the book is described as a dual story of Marian Graves and Hadley Baxter, a modern day actress with an eerily similar backstory to Marian who has recently been cast to play Graves in a film. While Hadley is by far the most prominent secondary character, her story still primarily revolved around finding out Marian’s life through her own journey. Though this decision made the overall narrative and themes stronger, Hadley is one of the most intriguing characters, and it’s a shame readers don’t get as much time with her as the book’s description seemed to promise.
Regardless, Shipstead’s work is still wildly enchanting, with expertly crafted prose and enchanting imagery. “Great Circle” is a novel about lofty ideals of truth, purpose, and connection across time and space, brought down to earth by a dynamic and complex cast of characters. If a reader is willing to give this novel the time it requires, the story’s universal appeal shines through.

“Nancy,” Chilean author Bruno Lloret’s first novel, tells the tragic life story of its eponymous protagonist, a 17-year-old runaway from a poor, fractured family in Chile. Her story is one of a desperate struggle for survival in an unforgiving, absurd world, where poverty and discontent are unquestioned axioms of living. The emotions of the text are raw and heart-wrenching to the point where it nearly becomes downright depressing.
But such a condemnation of the novel would overlook its purpose: critiquing the powers in society that cause the lives of so many Chileans to be so dismal. Indeed, “Nancy” is, at its heart, a social commentary, and the blows that send its protagonist to her lonely end are Lloret’s attempt at drawing attention to the flaws of modern Chilean society. Lloret’s harsh criticism of heavy industry (e.g. mining, canning) and Christian denominations that consume the lives of Chileans are particularly damning, as he frames these powers as taking advantage of the most vulnerable members of society: those who struggle to just put food on the table.
At the heart of what makes “Nancy” so evocative is Lloret’s writing, which is as thoughtful as it is poetic. The story, which is told in first person, is more fragmentary than cohesive, mixing snippets of dialogue with short passages of description. The tone is resigned and rather void of emotion, and yet Lloret’s final product truly is artful. His (and the translator Ellen Jones’) word choice is such that with even one short sentence he shows himself capable of conjuring up breathtaking images of arid salt flats, distant mountains, expansive beaches, and post-apocalyptic towns. But perhaps what is most impressive about Lloret’s writing is the rich religious symbolism that he weaves throughout the novel, combining it with shocking images of despair and desperation to convey a clear and powerful critique of society.
The most memorable element of “Nancy,” however, is the bold black X’s scattered across every page, breaking up dialogue and description and in many instances taking the place of traditional punctuation; in his letter to the reader, Lloret himself refers to his use of the X’s as “el Cruceo” (the Cross), another allusion to Christian symbolism. Whether they represent a break in the conversation, or a pounding heartbeat, or even a symbolic hourglass, their meaning is entirely subjective, but they make reading the novel a uniquely visual, tangible, and personal experience. Lloret’s use of el Cruceo is particularly effective when it breaks up dialogue or action, adding an element of silence into the text that changes the meaning of the words around it. It is what allows Lloret to develop subtext and evoke so much emotion with short and terse sentences; indeed, el Cruceo truly is a crucial part of the novel’s success.
“Nancy” is a unique read deserving of any thoughtful reader’s attention. Its descriptions are rich, its emotions moving, and its symbolism profound. On top of all that, Lloret’s use of el Cruceo adds an extra element of creatively interactive storytelling between the reader and the text. In sum, it is an engaging work that will leave its readers pondering its themes long after they’ve finished the final page, powerfully drawing attention to harms done to everyday Chileans by merciless heavy industry and domineering religious groups.

On Jan. 21, Billie Eilish and Rosalía finally released a song two years in the making, “Lo Vas a Olvidar.” Created for the television show “Euphoria,” the track is powerful and full of emotion. Despite the song’s minimal production, it is easy to get lost in the beauty of each individual sound layer. But the problem arose in how it was promoted. Spotify placed this song in their ¡Viva Latino! playlist, even though neither Billie Eilish nor Rosalía are Latinx. Spotify putting “Lo Vas a Olvidar” in their ¡Viva Latino! playlist is problematic on many levels. Rosalía is from Barcelona, Spain, on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean from Latin America; Eilish is an American singer of Irish and Scottish descent. Whether this was a marketing strategy or a fault on Spotify’s part is difficult to decipher.
This choice fits within a pattern of colonialism. White people continue to colonize cultures and languages that do not belong to them. First, it was Justin Bieber mocking the Spanish language in a club and singing the wrong lyrics from his collaboration with Luis Fonsi, “Despacito,” on Instagram Live. Now, we get Billie Eilish similarly clueless as to what she is singing.
It is exhausting to constantly hear Americans like Eilish attempt to expand their audience by singing in Spanish when they are not respecting the language and culture, not even understanding the meaning of what they are singing and its contextual significance. We do not need another “I don’t know the words so I say Dorito.” It is insensitive to mock a language that a large portion of your fanbase speaks on a daily basis. Still, Eilish is less at fault here because she actually worked on “‘Lo Vas a Olvidar” with Rosalía for months, asking if she was singing and pronouncing the words correctly. While she may not particularly understand the words she is singing, she is at least putting in the effort to present a work that closely resembles the native tongue.
Nonetheless, it is crystal clear that neither of these singers are Latinx — so why put the song on a playlist meant to celebrate Latinx musicians?
Spotify put this shoe in a box that it didn’t fit in and there’s a lot to unpack. It makes sense to want this song to be advertised in a way that will attract as many listeners as possible, but this is not the way. We now have Billie Eilish in a playlist alongside classic Latinx artists like Daddy Yankee and Bad Bunny. This just does not sit well, according to the many unhappy with the decision. The song could have been branded as a “Euphoria” tracklist highlight or honestly just as a brand new collaboration between two thriving artists. There was no need to categorize the track as something it is not.
This is a recurring issue with both Spotify and Apple Music and their attempts to put labels on certain artists or songs. It is 2021; we are well past the need to confine music to specific genres now that we are able to browse endless archives within these streaming platforms.
“Lo Vas A Olvidar” is a dynamic duet full of raw emotion and deserves recognition. It’s a good song, but it doesn’t belong in the ¡Viva Latino! playlist. The algorithm of music genre classification needs to change as soon as possible, because it is getting old seeing white people infiltrate Latinx charts and playlists. Artist exploration should be encouraged, but the results should never be labelled as something they are not.

What is, at first, most striking about “Raya and the Last Dragon” are the comparisons it evokes.
Its opening scene, as Raya zooms through the desert on her spherical companion Tuk Tuk, evokes Rey and BB-8 in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” The world — with its five tribes, each with a distinct fighting style and color scheme — feels very “Avatar”-esque. Even the story, of a young, courageous warrior princess who journeys across the known realm to restore a magical stone that will vanquish the dark, evil blight that plagues humanity, sounds a heck of a lot like “Moana.”
Similarities are unavoidable — hero’s journey and all that — and just because a film is reminiscent of others doesn’t automatically make it hackneyed and stale. Still, “Raya and the Last Dragon” doesn’t wow in the same way other Disney powerhouses do. It doesn’t have the subversiveness of “Frozen,” nor the pointed social commentary of “Zootopia” or the immersive imaginativity of “Wreck-It Ralph.” This isn’t to say that “Raya and the Last Dragon” is bad; it’s an uplifting, action-packed, beautifully animated film with a lot of heart, and a worthy addition to the Disney canon. But being a part of that canon inevitably comes with limitations.
In the film, Kelly Marie Tran voices Raya, an inspiring sign that, despite the racist harassment Tran faced following the release of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” in summer 2018, Tran remains unfazed. When a young Raya is betrayed by her friend Namaari (Gemma Chan), the evil Druun are released upon the world, turning most of humanity, including Raya’s father Benja (Daniel Dae Kim), into stone statues. Six years later, Raya seeks the help of a magical dragon, Sisu (Awkwafina) — along with a motley crew of friends, including Boun (Izaac Wang), a 10-year-old shrimp chef; Little Noi (Thalia Tran), a toddler con artist; and Tong (Benedict Wong), the hulking sole survivor of the Spine tribe — to vanquish the Druun and save the world.
The film features an almost all-Asian cast — the first of the studio’s films to do so. This is, indeed, progress, but in a post-”Crazy Rich Asians” world, one must ask: Is it enough? Despite being set in the fictional Southeast Asia-inspired world of Kumandra, most of the voice actors are not Southeast Asian, nor are Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, the film’s directors. And while Disney did create a “Southeast Asia Story Trust” composed of outside specialists to advise the creative team, it feels, in many ways, like a half-baked effort — one that (as the casting decisions make abundantly clear) is complicit in Southeast Asian erasure, that prioritizes looking like a Southeast Asian story instead of actually being one.
The film is, inarguably, action-adventure. Its chase scenes, fight sequences, and huge action set pieces leave no room for side plots or catchy musical numbers; it opts, instead, for an epic, soaring instrumental score from James Newton Howard (“The Hunger Games,” “The Dark Night”). The fight choreography is especially gripping; Qui Nguyen, who co-wrote the screenplay with Adele Lim (“Crazy Rich Asians"), served as one of five martial arts consultants on the film — and it shows. I don’t pretend to be an expert on Pencak silat or Muay Thai, but the fighting feels different: distinctive and detailed to a level that few animation studios have managed to achieve.
That being said, the film is hardly devoid of charm and whimsy. “Have you ever done a group project, and there’s that one kid who didn’t pitch in as much but still ended up with the same grade?” Sisu asks, with a modern patois that feels out of place for a 500 year-old dragon. Indeed, Awkwafina is the film’s comedic heart, with Nguyen and Lim’s script providing her with plenty of opportunities to flex her signature goofball energy.
Not even the pandemic, it seems, could compromise the studio’s unmatched visual standards. Despite being made from over 400 individual homes, “Raya and the Last Dragon” is as beautiful as ever. It’s no easy task to capture the idiosyncrasies of the myriad landscapes that constitute Southeast Asia, but the film does a pretty bang-up job. From rolling grasslands to marshy canals, from ornate temples to bustling, kaleidoscopic night markets, the film is a masterpiece of sound design, lighting, and especially production design: managing to balance several distinct visual landscapes without ever feeling overwhelming or confusing.
But the true beauty of “Raya” is, I think, less visual and more thematic. The film doesn’t glorify its protagonist; it doesn’t push the typical “only our protagonist can save the world” message that seems to be the default of action-adventure blockbusters. “Raya and the Last Dragon” is, in fact, a direct refutation of that. It’s a film about trust, about believing in and forgiving people, even when it’s difficult to do so — a message that, at a time when young people are less trusting than ever, is a particularly powerful one for Disney to affirm.
The most powerful message of this film, however, is one that it never actually makes.
Raya’s relationship with Naamari has all the trappings of a romantic subplot, the same adversary-to-ally-to-romantic partner progression that’s followed in “Beauty and the Beast” or “Tangled” — only notably without the climactic kiss scene. It’s reminiscent, in some ways, of watching Elsa’s journey from “not explicitly straight” in “Frozen” to “possibly gay?” with Honeymaren in “Frozen 2,” eliciting the same bated breath, anticipation, and ultimate disappointment.
One could argue that “Raya and the Last Dragon” has moved past needing a teenage romantic interest, that it eschews the typical Disney romance in favor of a deeper, more character-centric plot. And this is a perfectly fine argument; indeed, it’s one that “Moana” makes quite well. But the parallelism, the character arcs, the hand holding and tense, lingering glances between Raya and Naamari — they make it hard to see this as anything other than queerbaiting.
That said, “Raya and the Last Dragon” is still a good film — a great film, even. It does a lot, not just to exemplify the beauty and power of animation, but also to further Asian American representation in an often white, male industry.
I just wish it did a little bit more.
"Raya and the Last Dragon" releases in select theaters and is available on Disney+ with Premier Access on Mar. 5.

In Dec. 2020, Congress agreed to pass a $900 billion stimulus package in response to the coronavirus pandemic. To the surprise of many, the bill earmarked $15 billion for a version of the Save Our Stages Act, which provides grant money to cultural venues to cover rent, payroll, and maintenance. Though the bill follows the same general design of other Paycheck Protection Program loans — chiefly, to prevent layoffs and bankruptcies — the text of the bill makes clear that the grants are only for arts venues and administrators. Why leave out the artists themselves?
Save Our Stages neatly illustrates the U.S. government’s strategy vis-à-vis the arts: support the industry from afar without intervening in any art-making itself. In theory, this approach democratizes art; the artist is free to create a work and the public is free to celebrate or censure it themselves. But however well-intentioned, this laissez-faire system stifles the U.S. art industry’s progress and standing on the world stage. In an attempt to promote artistic freedom, America surrenders its art over to the private sector, which lines the pockets of leading art establishments in return for promotion and advertisement.
Those who fund the arts are entitled to special treatment at the venue. In America, arts organizations rely on individual and corporate donors to support their operating budgets and capital campaigns. If these entities suddenly decide that supporting the arts is not in their best interest, organizations are free to declare bankruptcy and go out of business, as many do. According to the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s 2019 annual report, Fidelity Investments, Bank of America, Dell EMC, and several individual benefactors each account for a larger share of funding than the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the National Endowment for the Arts.
Arts organizations are subject to the same type of competition that all for-profit businesses are. But financial institutions like Fidelity aren’t supporting art out of the goodness of their mercenary hearts. Their charity earns them the complicated benefits of tax deductions and brand exposure. Arts institutions are simply the blithe beneficiaries of a game of pecuniary chess between wealthy corporations and the government. In this way, the trivia of revenue law decide the next show on Broadway, or repertoire of the Cleveland Orchestra, or exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
This American attitude towards art is unique. Most other countries have a Cabinet-level executive that heads a nationalized Arts and Culture Department. The United States has no such thing; instead, the National Endowment for the Arts, an independent federal agency, provides the arts sector with grant money and works with state-level cultural councils. Despite America’s art-rich landscape, the NEA is a surprisingly weak institution. In fiscal year 2020, it only received $162 million, or 0.003% of the federal budget, paling in comparison to neighboring Mexico’s National Fund for Culture and Arts’ $440 million and $268 million for Canada’s Council for the Arts. Compared to peer nations, the United States pays embarrassingly little for art.
Though some, including influential producer Quincy Jones, have lobbied presidents for a Department of Arts and Culture, art’s independence from the mercurial Executive Branch is valuable. Imagine an arts sector with a financial situation that drastically changed with every new administration, defenseless against a seemingly art-indifferent or art-hostile president. The idea of a single Cabinet executive tasked with managing a sector as diverse, opinionated, and political as the arts is also troubling — what one person could possibly be a fair spokesperson for such a broad category?
As the art world is shaken by prolonged venue closures, art in America will be stuck in a cultural holding pattern if this system is allowed to continue. New art, works outside of the establishment, and regional art institutions will always be forced to play second fiddle to the giants of metropolitan fine art. Regional theaters traditionally serve as stepping stones to Broadway, but cannot do so if they declare bankruptcy next month. Small art institutions, those less likely to have multimillion dollar corporate “partnerships” and more likely to give a platform for new art from up-and-coming artists, require Washington’s outstretched hand in order to keep American art alive. They need a stronger NEA, a class of government arts managers to help institutions that would otherwise find themselves in bankruptcy, and a federal reckoning with the state of the arts industry: a prioritization of new art.
America needs to establish a ladder, equipped with a safety net, to ensure the nation’s future cultural treasures aren’t grounded before they even attempt to climb. Our current system is just an illusion of artistic freedom, which actually leaves us unfree to see, hear, and experience anything new. When the lights come up, at the behest of art’s financiers, many will rush to dust off the old. But we owe it to ourselves to leave those bygones dusty, and release art from the shackles of Wall Street.
Lights Up is a new think piece series in which writers reflect on structural and institutional problems in the pre-pandemic theater industry and consider how they can be addressed moving forward.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is something uniquely terrifying about being asked to unmute yourself over Zoom.
Thrown into the spotlight by a professor who requires students to stay unmuted, you are stripped of the security of silence as the entire class looks on. Will they be able to hear the bubbling slurps from my water bottle? What about my roommate singing as she cleans the kitchen? The embarrassment engendered by such noises is made exponentially worse by Zoom’s “Active Speaker” function. With green highlighting identifying your box as the noisy culprit, any sound becomes a public condemnation.
The question of precisely how much that little microphone on the side of your computer can pick up is one that has been heavily debated with the shift to virtual school. Students have to take bets on how much noise they can get away with in classes where muting is not an option. The occasional snicker from your classmates as your mom comes in to ask you — or rather, you and the rest of the class — a question is only one of many indications of defeat in this little game we play. And no matter how many times we tell our parents that, yes, we still have class, they seem to believe attendance is optional.
But what exactly causes us to become so unnerved when our professors and teaching fellows ask us to be fully present in class — mic on and all? Why do we become indignant when we are asked to emerge from our perfect shrouds of silence?
Harvard students have a vulnerability problem. We get to this place where everyone is exceptional, and we fight to suppress any indication that we’re not. We struggle to admit to each other that the very things that make us interesting, the little flaws and peccadillos that make us human, aren’t there. And we do this all the while trying to convince ourselves that we’re not the one mistake the admissions committee made — a file in the wrong pile.
So, why wouldn’t we seek to control our image in every way possible? In virtual school, we can save ourselves the embarrassment of an otherwise crunchy snack that would’ve been too noisy to enjoy in lecture. At least we can still privately message our problem set buddies even if we can’t sit next to them.
Zoom has its benefits, sure. And I’m not saying we should all be unmuting ourselves in lectures with 200 people; I’m not an advocate of technical chaos nor am I delusional. But, next time you’re in a seminar and the professor asks you to unmute or speak up, I think you should question your hesitancy.
The allure of the mute button on Zoom is the same as our endless desire to present a perfect image: a manicured front that seems welcoming, but in reality, is so carefully designed that it prevents any real authenticity.
We’re not afraid of that little button. We’re afraid of saying the wrong things, joining the wrong clubs, and deviating from the path of perfection that is so clearly laid out before us. We give our standard Harvard introductions, lament the piles of work that (despite our hours of dedication) never seem to subside, and go back to our predictable, socially acceptable existences. Together, but alone.
It’s almost not our fault. When we mute, it’s easier to portray the version of ourselves that we want the world to see. To unmute yourself is to be exposed in a way. It is to know that every single sound you make is going to be heard.
Even having your camera on is far more intimate than anything we would have otherwise experienced. At least with in-person classes, you meet in the neutral space of a classroom and can pick a somewhat isolated seat if you hope to avoid attention. But on Zoom, we are forced to allow others to witness the most intimate portions of our lives. Every action feels put on display. Our classmates can now see our bedrooms and our kitchens. They get to meet the people we’ve chosen to weather this crazy pandemic with, and maybe even learn your family’s special nickname for you. Small talk has shifted from comments on Cambridge’s dismal weather to comments on that poster above your headboard. The onslaught of personal details is so very present.
It’s totally understandable that we might become nervous to let so many into our little imperfect worlds. It is a difficult thing to let others see the places where we are freely awkward, or “off,” or messy. It asks something of us.
But when we curate our images or silence ourselves, we ground the connections we’re making in something that is inauthentic. Worse, we prevent others from seeing (or hearing) us for all that we are. And, as our teachers so lovingly remind us by asking us to unmute, everyone misses out as a result because we all have something unique to offer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The insurrection at the Capitol on Jan. 6 has left Americans looking back on the collapse of a presidency and the collateral damage of divisive rhetoric. President Donald Trump’s unwillingness to concede the election and his inflammatory language enabled the loss of five lives and the desecration of a sacred symbol of democracy. As a conservative, I join in many Americans’ — including Democrats’ — outrage at this political violence and disrespect for constitutional processes.
As the dust settles, especially after a chaotic impeachment period, students are left thinking about who is responsible for the insurrection. Trump and the rioters themselves are the most immediately culpable, but how broadly does the blame spread? Is it all Trump voters? All Republicans? All non-liberals even?
At a place like Harvard, where many affiliates are connected to the Trump administration, it’s crucial that we grapple with this question. The problem, however, occurs when the finger pointing goes too far: Blame becomes ambiguous, reconciliation impossible.
Students, particularly on the far left, have started to interpret and assign the charge of enablement — the action of giving someone the authority or means to do something — far too liberally. The bigger problem, however, is that they have become obstinate against engaging with any perceived “enablers.” Should this continue, there will be a weaponization of “enablement” to shut down any opposing narratives.
The Crimson Editorial Board, of which I am a member, wrote in January that “every Trump supporter enabled the Capitol insurrection.” I believe it’s a little more complicated than that.
There needs to be more precision in the use of the word “enable” and a greater recognition of its multiple layers. In my opinion, anyone who lied about election fraud, especially those in places of power or with major media presence, enabled the insurrection. They gave credence to a false claim that had sparked unfounded outrage across the country since Nov. 3.
But does the same apply for Republicans and Trump supporters at large? Trump voters enabled the president’s effort to fan the flames of misinformation, which indirectly emboldened rioters. However, saying that voters directly enabled the rioters is a bit more tenuous.
There were 74 million Trump voters. 74 million. Those are our neighbors, our relatives, and our friends. Are we to write off each and every one of them an insurrection enabler, especially when many denounced the riots? Are they fully to blame for other people's decision to storm the Capitol?
The accusations of enablement are concerningly broad at Harvard, especially. And once someone is labeled as an enabler, they are written off as part of the “Trump problem” and ascribed all of its ugliest facets — all of their opinions are assumed to lack merit.
A striking example is the recent petition and open letters to develop new accountability measures that could block former Trump administration officials from teaching, speaking, or serving as fellows at the University. Some students who supported the petition even called for banning everyone who served in the administration.
But this too is an oversimplification. Miles Taylor, former chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security and author of “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,” wrote that “many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.” Surely there is some virtue in this type of attachment to the Trump administration. Is it not possible that government officials could have been trying to thwart Trump's plans, to maintain order, from their public service posts?
After President Joe Biden won the election, I had conversations in which my peers explicitly endorsed the sentiment that non-Democrats are no longer needed in national politics and that bipartisanship is obsolete. With growing worry, I watched students and other Harvard affiliates endorse the view that any relationship with a Republican, or even a non-liberal, was a relationship with someone who was politically and morally irreconcilable.
In an Institute of Politics conversation with U.S. Representative Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), she said that “bi-partisan is a talking point. The goal is justice.” Justice, of course, is a necessary goal. Rooting out racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination should be integral to any lawmakers’ vision. However, you can’t hop from wanting justice to achieving it. There’s a system of government; our politicians need to work with fellow legislators, especially when they represent half the country. Yet, Representative Pressley’s devaluation of bipartisanship, though cloaked in the name of justice, rejects the spirit of collaboration that this country was built on, and needs to uphold in order to make progress.
It feels like burning the bridge across the aisle is the new standard for Harvard political discourse. This is a grave disservice to students. Engaging with the opposition, rather than shunning them, is a positive any way you look at it. It gives students a chance to publicly criticize leaders they do not agree with and a chance to learn about a new perspective. If people continue to retreat further into their ideological camps, there is no future for this country and no road to reconciliation.
So cycling back to our 74 million Trump voters, are they all culpable enablers of the attack on the Capitol? While each and every Trump voter enabled the former president, I do not see this as equivalent to enabling the Capitol riots. While they may have enabled Trump’s problematic behavior, they could not all have anticipated such a drastic culmination of his presidency. While they voted for a divisive president, they should not be written off as criminals, complicit with Jan. 6.
It’s time to work with these voters again and to understand their frustration. Only then can we address the divisions in the country. Our newly-elected president said that “unity is the path forward” in his inaugural address. Unity is not spreading blame so far that we lose accountability; unity is moving forward and striving to find the common ground.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Commencement should be a time for joy. It should be a celebration of years' worth of all-nighters and the fruits they bear; a bittersweet farewell full of hugs, pictures, and emotional goodbyes. Commencement marks the end of our time at Harvard — and our last chance to enjoy it before we leave.
But yet another class will graduate via pixels, leaving Cambridge without this traditional rite of passage. Last week, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that Harvard would postpone its Commencement Exercises for the Class of 2021 and hold a virtual ceremony for the second consecutive year due to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.
The move is upsetting but warranted. We understand the public health imperative and commend Harvard for prioritizing our community's safety. As President Bacow pointed out, we can't predict what the pandemic will look like in the spring, and the risks associated with an incorrect guess are far too great. Commencement will just have to wait.
The question then becomes: Wait until when? And for what exactly?
Harvard has now reassured two separate senior classes that “one day” they will have an in-person graduation event, but has yet to offer any plan for what such a day might look like. Virtual commencement — bidding goodbye to friends and professors over glitchy Zooms, throwing an academic cap straight into your ceiling fan — is no way to end your college career. Our seniors deserve to know that someone within our vast university bureaucracy is actively figuring out when and how they’ll get to say their proper goodbyes. Giving the Classes of 2020 and 2021 a concrete indication — forming an advisory committee accountable to the task, for example — will help make this necessary yet painful loss easier to swallow.
In the meantime, Harvard could at least try to make Zoom commencement more appealing. The online experience will never match an in-person celebration, but that’s no reason to make it insufferably dull. Some of our professors — Professor Eddie Kohler in Computer Science 61: “Systems Programming and Machine Organization” and Professor Edward Glaeser in Economics 1011a: “Intermediate Microeconomics: Advanced”, to name a few — have done so much this year to move beyond just virtual lectures. The administration shouldn't limit itself to a glorified tape either — after all, what's the point of an Ivy brain-trust if you can't meet challenges with new, creative ideas? Let's approach virtual commencement with innovative dedication, and set an example for institutions facing similar challenges.
And speaking of setting examples: Regardless of its format, the virtual ceremony will be made brighter by the presence of principal speaker Ruth J. Simmons.
Simmons — the president of Prairie View A&M University, a historically black university; the former president of Brown University; and the first Black president of an Ivy League institution — is an exciting, inspirational pick for what might be an otherwise uninspiring ceremony. The initiatives she championed at Brown, establishing need-blind admissions and forcefully reckoning with the university’s ties to slavery, represent the best of higher education. She has shown a commitment to and understanding of the full range and importance of higher education in the United States, and we can’t wait to hear her speak.
If only the administration heard her too. There's an increasingly stark contrast between the choices Harvard makes in front of the world and those it makes in front of its students. This is, after all, the same Harvard that has just denied tenure review to political activist and beloved Professor Cornel West ’74; that denied tenure to award-winning ethnic studies scholar and Associate Professor Lorgia García Peña; that continues to resist the creation of a multicultural center on campus.
Perhaps that's the main takeaway from the commencement debacle: It’s bittersweet. Our university makes the right call in postponing the ceremony but offers no specifics or details to encourage our understandably let-down seniors. It invites a brilliant, forward-thinking speaker, yet does not follow her example in its own backyard. Harvard cannot let these gestures be empty promises.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In light of the Ivy League’s sudden policy change allowing senior student athletes to compete next year at their respective universities as graduate students, Harvard Athletics is supporting interested athletes by answering informational questions and writing recommendation letters, according to Harvard Athletics Director Erin McDermott.
The presidents of the eight universities in the Ivy League announced in February that they would grant a temporary waiver for current senior athletes — all of whom lost a season of competition due to Covid-19 — to compete as graduate students, a break with longstanding League policies barring graduate students from athletics.
Notably, the decision came at a time when many Harvard and Ivy League graduate programs’ application deadlines had already passed.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow signaled in a webinar with student athletes last week that Harvard’s graduate programs will not extend their deadlines for senior athletes in light of the League’s new policy.
“I think to go back and ask graduate programs to reopen their admissions is a bridge too far, because it does sort of become the tail wagging the dog,” Bacow said during the webinar.
McDermott said in an interview last week that members of her department “haven’t had conversations” with the University’s graduate programs regarding athletes’ admissions into their schools.
Rather, McDermott said Harvard Athletics is helping a “handful” of students who have expressed interest in using the waiver by offering advice and providing written support through normal admissions channels.
“What we have done is had conversations with the students who have expressed interest in doing this and making sure that they understand what they need to do,” she said. “Definitely providing letters of recommendation if they ask us for those, whether it’s coaches or other people.”
High school students recruited to play sports at Harvard College often receive endorsements and advice from coaches during the admissions process. Court filings in 2018 showed that highly academically qualified athletes have an acceptance rate of roughly 83 percent.
However, according to Anna Ivey, a former University of Chicago Law School admissions dean who now works as an admissions consultant, an advantage for athletes has not been established in Ivy League graduate school admissions.
“Historically with grad school, the admissions office has not had these formal relationships with the coaches and athletic recruiting the way undergrad has,” Ivey said.
Still, Ivey said Harvard student athletes who apply to the University’s graduate programs may already have a “small bump” in the admissions cycle given their Harvard affiliation.
“Would it get you into a Harvard graduate school if you’re not otherwise competitive? Probably not,” she said. “But it certainly does not hurt you to have done undergrad at Harvard.”

Theodora Skeadas ’12 announced her candidacy for Cambridge City Council on Feb. 19 with a tweet that read “Let’s get started!”
Skeadas — who earned a master’s in public policy from the Kennedy School in 2016 — said in an interview she considered a run in 2017 but opted instead to helm the successful council campaign for current Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui. Now launching her own candidacy, Skeadas said her passion for organizing and for the city itself compelled her to run for office.
“I'm running to fight for a fair economy, a sustainable economy, empower local businesses and hold the city accountable to the progressive leadership that Cambridge deserves,” Skeadas said. “I’m running because I love Cambridge.”
A former board member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association and the current executive director of nonprofit network Cambridge Local First, Skeadas said she believes one of the biggest issues facing Cambridge is protecting local businesses during the Covid-19 pandemic. In the last year, several longtime Cambridge small businesses have closed, including Cafe Pamplona, The People’s Republik, and Border Cafe.
“In Massachusetts, by November, 37 percent of local businesses have closed their doors,” Skeadas said. “It's a disaster, really an existential crisis.”
Skeadas’ colleagues praised her response to the Covid-19 pandemic in her role leading Cambridge Local First. Rachael Solem, the president of the Cambridge bed-and-breakfast Irving House and a member of the nonprofit's board, said that when it comes to the local economy, Skeadas “really gets it."
“She has been by far the most effective, efficient, engaged, intelligent, and inspiring of all of the executive directors we've had,” Solem said. “And that's saying something, because we have had some pretty wonderful and amazing people.”
Skeadas’ platform includes promoting the use of mass transit, implementing clean infrastructure, incentivizing local business initiatives, and adopting electrification requirements to move the city toward net zero carbon emissions.
Skeadas said she believes her advocacy for environmental issues complements her commitment to growing the city's economy.
“I want to elevate the conversation, not just on the importance of a local economy, but also its intense connection to environmental sustainability because locally driven economies are sustainable economies,” Skeadas said. “These are economies of scale that work.”
Laurie F. Rothstein, executive director of the nonprofit Cambridge Volunteer Clearinghouse, called Skeadas' support for local businesses “remarkable."
“She has an incredibly good grounding of what people actually need in order to succeed,” Rothstein said. “Providing information, gathering information, creating places for people to talk together and figure stuff out.”
In addition to protecting local businesses and initiating environmental reforms, Skeadas said she plans to focus her candidacy on equitable education, racial and criminal justice reform, and housing justice.
“Focusing on housing through the lens of the interests of tenants, as opposed to real estate developers, is the lens that I want to employ,” she said. “So readdressing local eviction, and rent control legislation is something that I hope to do.”
Announcing her candidacy nine months in advance of the November election, Skeadas said she plans to use the time to fundraise and research policy issues. In a Feb. 26 tweet, she wrote she raised more than $10,000 during her first week on the campaign trail.
Skeadas said she hopes to use campaign funds to hire a campaign manager by the beginning of May and eventually bring aboard a full staff.
As for what differentiates Skeadas from the rest of the field, she pointed to her “track record of success” in managing Siddiqui’s successful 2017 campaign, in which the mayor reached the second most top choice votes in Cambridge’s ranked choice voting system out of the entire 25-person field.
“I plan to build off of that success,” she said. “In terms of why I’m qualified — I think it's significant experience in Cambridge, a commitment to learning about the important issues, a willingness to grow, a curiosity to improve, and ultimately a passion for public service.”
Many of Skeadas’ colleagues and friends also praised Skeadas for not only her listening skills, but her energy and productivity.
Dan Yonah Ben-Dror Marshall, executive director of Cambridge Community Center for the Arts, said he could not compare Skeadas to other potential candidates because she is “one of a kind."
“Very few people can compete with that energy, initiative, resourcefulness,” he said.

Bloomberg Philanthropies will donate $150 million to fund a new Harvard-wide Bloomberg Center for Cities and endow 10 new chair positions for faculty working on city-related issues.
The gift is the second major donation Bloomberg Philanthropies — the philanthropic organization run by former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg — has given to Harvard in the last decade. Bloomberg, a graduate of Harvard Business School, previously funded the creation of the Bloomberg Harvard City Leadership Initiative, which provides training to mayors across the country.
The new center, which Harvard announced in a press release Tuesday, will provide additional resources and “custom programming” for newly elected mayors and city hall officials. It also plans to offer postgraduate city hall fellowships and conduct research on city governance.
“Building on our partnership with Harvard, this new investment will help more city leaders learn from one another and get even more big things done locally,” Bloomberg said in the press release.
The Bloomberg City Leadership Initiative, which is housed jointly at the Harvard Kennedy School and Harvard Business School, has hosted more than 400 mayors and 1,300 city officials from nearly 500 cities worldwide since its launch in 2017. Bloomberg endowed the program with $32 million in 2016.
When Bloomberg made his brief but expensive bid for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020, at least 23 mayors who participated in the program endorsed his candidacy.
“The prospect of helping to bring about more effective leadership through collaboration and innovation is as exciting as it is inspiring,” University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in the press release. “We look forward to seeing the resources, tools, and support provided by the Center put to good use in city halls around the world.”
The program will be run out of the Kennedy School, Bacow said at a faculty meeting Tuesday.
Harvard took in more than $478 million in current-use donations from alumni and philanthropic organizations in Fiscal Year 2020, representing 9 percent of the University’s operating revenues. The University accepted substantial donations from several major philanthropic organizations in the fiscal year, including more than $35 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The Harvard donation is one of a slew of programs Bloomberg has sponsored across the country aimed at supporting city leaders, including partnerships with the Aspen Institute and Johns Hopkins University.
“This is a major new investment in the people who have enormous and unique powers to attack society’s biggest challenges: mayors,” Bloomberg said in the announcement. “The pandemic has driven home just how important mayors are to the everyday lives of billions of people.”

UPDATED: Wednesday, March 3 at 12:45 p.m.
Just more than half of pregnant women surveyed across 16 countries would like to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, according to a study published Monday by Harvard School of Public Health researchers, who said the results show an obstacle to achieving herd immunity.
The survey was sent out to nearly 18,000 participants — pregnant women and mothers of children younger than 18 — in 14 countries with the highest incidences of Covid-19, in addition to Australia and New Zealand.
Overall, the survey found that 69 percent of women intended to vaccinate their children. Fifty-two percent of pregnant women and 73 percent of non-pregnant mothers indicated interest in receiving the vaccine for themselves.
School of Public Health research scientist and corresponding author of the study Julia W. Wu said lower vaccine acceptance rates in pregnant women compared to those among non-pregnant mothers may be due to a lack of clinical evidence regarding the vaccines’ effects on fetal health and pregnancy.
As a result, Wu said there is a need for physicians to better inform pregnant women of the risks and benefits involved in getting the vaccine.
Wu also said the researchers saw “huge geographic variation” in vaccine acceptance levels.
The survey found that vaccine acceptance was lowest in the United States, Australia, and Russia. Less than 45 percent of pregnant women and 56 percent of non-pregnant mothers in those countries indicated interest in getting vaccinated.
In contrast, India, the Philippines, and Latin America had the highest vaccine acceptance levels. In those regions, pregnant women and non-pregnant mothers reported 80 and 90 percent acceptance rates, respectively.
For effective global vaccine distribution, the researchers said vaccine rollout programs should be well-informed by local populations' particular concerns.
School of Public Health epidemiology professor Sonia Hernandez-Diaz, an author of the study, said the research team also used the data to identify important factors contributing to lower levels of Covid-19 vaccine acceptance.
The most significant predictors of vaccine acceptance include confidence in the vaccine’s safety and efficacy, perception of the risk posed by Covid-19, belief in the importance of mass vaccination, general attitudes to routine childhood immunizations, and public trust in government leadership and healthcare systems, per Wu.
Caroline O. Buckee, a School of Public Health assistant professor of epidemiology who was not involved in the study, said the survey shows the importance of “understanding the local context” and implementing local messaging systems to combat misinformation in areas where vaccine hesitancy is prevalent.
“It is a huge issue not just internationally, and not just among women — it’s a huge issue in the U.S. as well,” Buckee said regarding vaccine hesitancy. “And it’s something that’s going to be probably going to play an increasingly important role in how we manage the pandemic moving forward.”
Clarification: September 14, 2020
This article has been updated to clarify the researchers' main takeaway from the survey. The researchers see the relatively low vaccine acceptance rate in pregnant women as an obstacle to herd immunity. A previous version of this article focused on the percentage of women who would like their children to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Looking ahead to the 2021-2022 academic year, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said her office aspires to “have as normal a fall as we can” in a Monday interview.
Ever since being dispersed from campus almost exactly one year ago due to the burgeoning Covid-19 crisis, students at the College have taken courses online. While many undergraduates have been studying from afar, some returned to campus to do their coursework in Harvard’s dorms. The College welcomed back freshmen and a select group of upperclassmen to campus in the fall; this spring, it invited seniors, enrolled juniors, and students with personal or environmental learning difficulties to move into its residential spaces.
In this past year, undergraduate students have experienced a wide range of difficulties when it comes to virtual learning, including technical issues with online learning, social isolation, and navigating classes in completely different time zones.
O’Dair said that the DSO’s “goal” is for the College to be “fully operational” next fall.
“We are in our planning, thinking through our operation so we can welcome as many students back to campus as we can,” O’Dair said.
Despite her hope for a livelier campus in the fall, O’Dair pressed on the need to be “flexible” in the context of much “uncertainty” regarding the country’s Covid-19 prognosis.
O’Dair’s Monday statements come on the heels of a Sunday email that the College would be moving from “Level Three: Yellow” of its campus reopening phases into a provisional status of “Level Four: Lime” on March 1.
Level Four allows students to gather in groups of up to eight in some indoor common room spaces, as well as for independent study in dining halls. It also opens up the possibility for some College, House, or Yard sponsored outdoor programming. The step up from Level Three came less than three weeks after the College announced its move into Level Three from “Level Two: Orange,” marking a steady rate of progress.
“It might have seemed quick to move from Yellow to Lime,” O’Dair acknowledged, but explained that the DSO had seen “positive trends” in the residential community.
O’Dair said that there were “a number of factors” that contributed to the decision to move into Level Four, such as strong compliance with Crimson Clear – an app on which students log a daily attestation of their health — in addition to a low student positivity rate for Covid-19. There have only been three positive cases of Covid-19 among undergraduate students in the past week, according to the University’s testing dashboard.
“Students are doing really well,” O’Dair said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Graduate Council heard updates on recent activism work, reviewed petitions, mulled graduate student IT policies, and passed constitutional amendments Monday evening during its first public meeting of the month.
Mark R. Haidar, a Harvard Law School student and president of the Law School’s chapter of the Equal Democracy Project, opened the meeting with a presentation on the EDP Task Force — a joint initiative between undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty at the University that aims to make Election Day a University holiday.
Haidar said he hopes the recently-formed task force will project a more unified front than similar efforts in the past.
“The goal here is to show the unambiguous will of the student body,” Haidar said. “Our goal is to show that if we can get all 12 student government bodies to pass this resolution, signaling their support, then that gives a stronger call for the administration.”
Also at the meeting, Mena W. Ahmed, a student at the Graduate School of Design, shared progress on efforts to ensure students graduating during the pandemic have access to their Harvard emails following graduation. Though the policy has been approved for 2020 graduates to expand their access to post-graduation opportunities during the Covid-19 pandemic, Ahmed said current efforts aim to extend it to 2021 graduates as well.
Ahmed also stated her goal for permanent University-affiliated email accounts, an issue she said alumni have previously raised. She cited career development, increased access to Harvard faculty, and the maintenance of a broader University network as benefits of permanent emails for Harvard graduates.
“The cost of not doing anything about this is that it puts more strain on Career Services, it’s harder to contact professors without your Harvard email,” she said. “There’s a general loss of identity and community, and feeling of backing from our institution.”
The Council also deliberated a motion to sign a letter condemning Harvard for allegedly denying tenure to Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74. The letter — addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay — criticizes the University’s decision to dismiss West's request for tenure and urges Harvard to express committment to “advancing racial justice in substantive ways.”
“Ultimately, Harvard’s denial of tenure to Professor West is a testament to Harvard’s continued expulsion of faculty who offer incisive analysis of white supremacy, racial capitalism, Zionism, and the military-industrial complex, all of which Professor West fervently critiques,” the letter reads.
Chair of Advocacy Abhinaya Narayanan said the letter not only urged administrators to grant West tenure, but also called attention to broader systemic inequalities in tenure procedures at the University.
“This letter is in regards to the denial of tenure for Professor Cornel West,” she said. “But it is more broadly around the processes of tenure at Harvard and the concerns around the lack of representation of Black and brown scholars and scholars in the ethnic studies field.”
After a discussion surrounding the deployment of ad hoc committees in the University’s tenure evaluation process, the Council declined to vote during the meeting, instead electing to move to an e-vote scheduled to close Mar. 10.
The Council also entertained constitutional amendments that standardized titles for certain elected representatives within its own ranks. One such motion called to strike the word “primary” from “primary voting representative,” and “alternate” from “alternate voting representative.”
“As such, all representatives shall be equal in position and power,” the motion reads.
A similar motion called to strike the word “vice” from “vice chair,” thus standardizing the roles of chairs in the Council. Both motions passed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Evelyn L. Hu and Physics professor John M. Doyle moved for the establishment of a new graduate program in Quantum Science and Engineering during a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Tuesday.
The program — which would bridge several existing departments and areas in FAS and SEAS, including Chemistry, Physics, and Computer Science — would train students in speaking “a common language” relevant to practical applications of the study of subatomic particle behavior, Doyle said in an interview.
Hu said in an interview that the emergence of a field in quantum science bears resemblance to the initial days of computer science, when “computer science slowly emerged from math.”
“There was a period where there were no computers. Imagine having to take all your CS courses in the math department,” Hu said. “The fundamentals, the basics, the core courses that we think students need to have, don’t exist in any existing tracks or concentrations.”
Physics professor Mikhail D. Lukin — a co-director of Harvard’s existing Quantum Science and Engineering Initiative alongside Hu and Doyle — said in an interview Harvard is “a pioneer in really moving all the way towards an integrated, certified Ph.D. program.”
Lukin said the “time was right” for the introduction of the new graduate program, describing how the quantum science field will “start playing a bigger and bigger role” in real-world applications, such as computational and communication devices.
“Moore’s Law basically says that as the computational power increases, the size of the transistor decreases exponentially with time. This is what has driven the kind of progress in information technology we have seen over the last several decades,” Lukin said. “It is, by now, very clear that Moore’s Law is really coming to the end.”
During the faculty meeting, Doyle highlighted several FAS faculty conducting research into quantum science, including Lukin — whose lab is researching devices to improve quantum communication and move the field closer to developing a quantum internet.
Hu said that while research into quantum science and engineering has only begun to take root at Harvard, she and her colleagues envision the graduate degree program will foster a “lasting legacy beyond what we do as individuals or in groups.”
Also during Tuesday’s meeting, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay addressed planning for the fall semester as Harvard nears the one-year anniversary of its shift to remote learning due to the coronavirus crisis. She said University administrators are preparing to tentatively teach large courses in a hybrid format during the fall semester “to regain [Harvard’s] campus-based identity.”
“Planning is underway for the fall, and our overriding goal remains charting a path to a full return for our students, faculty, and staff,” Gay said. “The [Office of Undergraduate Education] has been leading efforts to pilot modes of hybrid learning.”
In December, Gay announced the FAS would pilot some in-person academic experiences during the spring semester. Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh shared Tuesday that 56 faculty members volunteered for the trial, which will allow the FAS to preview teaching lectures in a hybrid format — in addition to holding lab sections and studio art and performance courses in-person with proper precautions.
“We’re preparing for all possibilities this fall, among them the possibility that we might have to teach some of our larger classes in hybrid form — that is, with some students in-person and some remote — and also that we might need to teach our small courses in a socially-distanced way,” Claybaugh said.
“We expect to learn a great deal from these experiments, and we’ll use what we learn to guide our planning for the fall,” Claybaugh added.
The program will go before the faculty for a vote of approval during their next meeting on April 6.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge City Council advanced a zoning amendment for the Alewife neighborhood to the next round of consideration and received yet another update on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout at Monday's meeting.
The Council passed a motion 6-3 to bring the zoning petition to a second reading, awaiting a final vote on March 15. The petition proposes the development of 490 units of affordable housing and $17 million in funding toward a new bridge with an accompanying shuttle service for the area.
Petition sponsor Councilor Marc C. McGovern said current zoning laws in Alewife should be changed to accommodate new housing and neighborhood improvements.
“A lot of the things that we are talking about are community benefits: housing, the bridge, additional open space, reduction in parking, retail — none of those things are required under current zoning,” McGovern said. “At the end of the day, I have to decide and we have to decide what we think is the better outcome for the city and the community."
City councilors also unanimously adopted a policy order to explore whether a city-owned parking lot in West Cambridge can be converted into affordable housing.
Councilor Patricia M. “Patty” Nolan ’80, a co-sponsor of the policy order, said the legislation is only “starting the conversation” with the neighborhood and tenants and within the council.
“We have said parking is something we can deal with in other ways, that we shouldn’t be preserving parking lots just for the sake of having cars come in,” Nolan said.
For the 22nd consecutive year, Cambridge received AAA ratings from the three major credit rating agencies in the United States — one of only 27 cities selected this year. Still, Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan cautioned against celebrating.
Zondervan cited the disparity between two Cambridge neighborhoods: Kendall Square and Cambridgeport. Zondervan said focusing too much on the AAA bond rating is a “missed opportunity” to pursue “anti-racist work” and make sure the city is “really distributing those benefits equitabily.”
“We’re continuing to approve big commercial developments, big buildings that perpetuate that injustice and inequality, and we’re not really addressing it,” he said.
Also at the meeting, City Manager Louis A. DePasquale presented his weekly report on the Cambridge pandemic response. On March 1, Cambridge entered “Phase Three, Step Two” of its Covid-19 reopening, which raised capacity limits across the city to 50 percent. The case positivity rate in the city has continually declined since January, when the pandemic was at its height, dropping to 0.41 percent as of Feb. 20.
DePasquale said the decrease in new infections and progression of the city vaccination program justifies the lessening of restrictions.
“I believe this decision is in line with our strategy and appropriate as Cambridge data continues to trend to a positive of hopefully returning back to a green community,” DePasquale said.
Cambridge vaccination efforts continue to be hampered by the ongoing statewide shortage of doses, according to Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob. The city has limited access to first dose vaccines for select groups, which include clients and staff of homeless shelters; low income or affordable senior housing; and homebound individuals. Jacob said that the dose shortage is largely out of the city’s control.
“This is an unfortunate reality,” Jacob said. “It does place severe limitations on the state's vaccine allocations and the distribution, and therefore, what options we have on the ground here in the city.”

Nearly a year after they were sent home amid growing concerns regarding the novel coronavirus, members of the Class of 2021 are now preparing for the culmination of their undergraduate studies.
Before attaining their coveted degrees, however, many seniors must overcome the last few hurdles of their college careers — job interviews, graduate school applications, and for some, senior theses.
For many seniors, the thesis-ing process has been complicated by snowstorms, closed labs and libraries, and Zoom fatigue, which has prompted some departments to push deadlines.
However, for seniors pursuing theses in studio and performing arts concentrations, the show must go on.
Seniors from those concentrations — Art, Film and Visual Studies, along with Music and Theater, Dance, and Media — have spent the past year navigating shutdowns in rehearsal and performance spaces and the impossibility of full in-person collaboration.
In the wake of these challenges, seniors said they responded with varying degrees of both technical and artistic adaptation to tailor their projects to a pandemic-laden world.
“I could not have done this specific project had this year been different, had it not been in a pandemic, had I been at school like a normal year,” said Ellen L. “Elle” Shaheen ’21 of her TDM performance thesis. “I could not have made it a year ago or a year in the future. It would be totally different.”
Many seniors working on Arts theses found inspiration for their projects out of the uncertainty that began last spring.
Benjamin P. Wenzelberg ’21-’22, an English concentrator with a Music secondary who is taking a gap semester, said his thesis responded to the emotional turmoil enveloping the world.
Wenzelberg explained how the pandemic and his gap semester gave him a “very different headspace” to work on his thesis, which is a commissioned opera for Lowell House Opera that adapts episodes of James Joyce's Ulysses.
“My thesis asks the question, fundamentally, of what home is, what it means to lose your way from home, and how to return to it,” he said. “Especially in this time, when all of us are isolated and trying to understand what that means.”
Natalie J. Gale ’21, a joint concentrator in History and Literature and AFVS, said the circumstances of the coronavirus lockdown largely shaped her thesis.
“I really started thinking about rural space as I went back to my home in Maine last March and as all my friends similarly scattered to mostly less urban places across the country,” she wrote in an email. “Super concretely, though, my creative thesis is what it is solely because of the pandemic.”
Alongside an analytical paper, Gale will present a short film, online gallery, and photobook exploring the relationship between lesbian feminist separatists settling on ancestral Siletz land and her own queer community’s relationship to “rural space and settlerism.”
“I spent the fall road tripping to do outdoor, socially-distanced photoshoots with a bunch of queer households located all around rural New England, which obviously would never have happened if not for the pandemic,” she said.
Christina Yee ’21, also an AFVS concentrator, said her thesis evolved from a project exploring the day-to-day influences of branding and marketing into a website that allows viewers to interact with a fictional brand.
“At first when I submitted my proposal, it was definitely more focused on creating something physical,” she said. “As things evolved, I really had to consider how to best convey this experience to people who won’t be able to hold this thing in their hands, and the best solution was the website.”
Devonne D. Pitts ’21, a joint concentrator in TDM and History and Literature, also reshaped her performance thesis, which is a play that explores the question: “How do we deal with death and what happens when we don’t?”
Pitts described how she had to adjust to this question given the barrage of headlines and personal narratives of the past year.
“I was asking the question in what felt like (and continues to feel like) a shifting social paradigm,” she wrote. “My thesis advisors were super helpful in guiding me through those questions by encouraging me to reflect on how these events were affecting me personally.”
Whether they physically traveled to to produce their theses or did most of their work from home, seniors found unexpected connections and personal discovery in their various locations.
Eli Zuzovsky ’21 had most of the screenplay portion of his joint English and AFVS Concentration thesis – a short film and polyphonic novella reimagining his bar mitzvah – written before lockdown. From March to August, he traveled to Israel to shoot his film in Hebrew with a cast of local actors.
“In the shoot itself, at the beginning of the day, we would have a conversation with the entire cast and crew and would take everybody’s temperature,” he said. “We had a person who was our Covid supervisor and made sure that everyone had masks, that they needed to be socially distanced.”
Shaheen explained how her performance thesis, originally planned as a live show at Harvard, became a filmed performance in her hometown in New Hampshire. She said she ended up being not just a writer, but producer, sole performer, and choreographer too.
“I live in a place that has a beautiful arts community that I’ve been a part of since I was little, and I knew that I had people that I wanted to work with,” she said. “I thought, ‘Well, I’m home. So, you know, I might as well utilize them if they want to work with me.’”
Pitts — the senior writing a play about coping with death — said she also forged connections with people in her hometown. She described how she found an unexpected “deepening” in relationships while discussing her thesis with friends, family, and colleagues.
“I deeply appreciated every single one of these discussions I was able to have over the last year or so,” Pitts wrote. “I think I was most proud that the framework of my thesis had allowed the deepening of those connections to take place, in ways I hadn’t originally intended.”
Like so many of their other experiences over the past year, Arts concentrators also found numerous difficulties in the thesis-writing process.
Nivedita “Nivi” Ravi ’21, a joint concentrator in neuroscience and music, said she experienced increased isolation while assembling the musicology portion of her thesis, which studied the effect of music exposure in infancy on the white matter organization of infant brains.
“I think when you're working on a thesis in a digital environment you are kind of going through this experience and process in a very isolated setting,” Ravi said. “Of course I had a few friends who are writing theses, but there was less of this kind of campus community where you felt like a ton of seniors were in your position as well.”
Aaron T. Hodges ’21, who created a computational method to improve cochlear implants for a joint biomedical engineering and music thesis, described how limited in-person interactions hindered his research process.
“I was going to try to get patients where I could actually test some of the results with them, but because of Covid that became a lot more difficult, and so I ended up switching over to Zoom,” he said. “I was planning on interviewing a lot more people, but definitely kind of fell short after the pandemic hit.”
Still, some seniors said they were able to transform difficulties into learning opportunities.
Yee said her time away from a studio instilled in her the value of physically making art.
“I’m still trying to get back into a studio space and work with something physical,” she said. “I miss having a paintbrush, or doing printmaking by hand, and being able to see that in front of me.”
“I guess, if anything, Covid has taught me that when I do have that chance once again I should just dive back into it and really treasure it,” Yee added.
Despite encountering setbacks throughout their thesis processes, some seniors said they remained fixed on the big picture — their thesis as the culmination of their time at Harvard.
Wenzelberg said his gap semester was his “silver lining” of the pandemic since the additional time allowed him to make his thesis the “best that it can possibly be.”
“Seeing, as I know a lot of my friends are, the product of our work and knowing that this is what we’re going to put into the world and share with other people, is absolutely exhilarating and something for which I'm extremely grateful,” he added.
Zuzovsky said he appreciated the personal and intellectual growth he experienced thanks to creating his thesis.
“I think the best aspect of this process so far has just been its educational value,” he said. “I really, really do feel like I’ve learned so much about myself, about myself as a director, about myself as a writer, about the world.”
CORRECTION: March 16, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Eli Zuzovsky ’21 traveled to Israel in August to shoot his film. In fact, he was there from March to August.

Dear Oatly Oat Drink™,
I sit here typing with one hand which means my words are coming out ever so slowly — but with my free hand, I am able to shake another one of your delicious cartons as I prepare to indulge my senses. I burn, I pine, I perish… all for you.
Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you. Your light blue hue was the only thing giving me light on the dreary fall days when I was forced to microwave my food, watching sadly through the revolving door of the contraption as I waited anxiously for the timer to go down. What else could bring me joy? Certainly not anything but you and HUDS New England Clam Chowder!
We have had so many good times together, from the time I first tried you after almost getting indoctrinated into a vegan cult by my friends from the nerd school (Author’s note: this is MIT) and wondered how anyone could possibly choose you over Cow’s Milk™. However, I was soon addicted and our love affair became intoxicating. I would begin to read your nutrition facts instead of my history reading. Who knew low erucic acid rapeseed oil could taste so good when combined with water and oats? I even woke up early for breakfast just to get more of you, and I have a 9 a.m. Every. Single. Day.
Unfortunately, all is fair in love and war, and in October, I forsake you. Instead of drinking you, my love, and collecting my only serotonin for the day, I began to collect you for a man I unsuccessfully simped for. I probably should have known something was up when he asked me to bring you. To see the look on his face as I walked through his door, handing him a bag of eight of you, painstakingly received from the dining hall over the course of about a week, realizing that my worst fear had come true was truly frightening. I had let a man get between our relationship. I knew right then and there that while I could never make another man as happy as I did him by handing over a bag full of Oatly Oat Drink™, I would make myself infinitely more happy by keeping you to myself.
This semester, I can finally tell you that I know what loss is, since I do not see you every day. I make the dreary walk to Annenberg, hoping in my heart of hearts that I might see you. Most days, you never appear. Some days, I scrounge for a singular bottle of Oatly Chocolate Oat Drink™, knowing that there is a God above whenever it happens. Last week, I saw a whole box of you. When I asked for some more, the amazing HUDS worker gave me four whole cartons of you, bless that man. In that moment, I knew I was loved and special. All thanks to you. And so, I give you all my love, and I miss you until the moment I see you again.
Yours forever and always,
Matylda A. Urbaniak
