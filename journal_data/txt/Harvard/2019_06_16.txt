“States of Mind,” is, undoubtedly, a quick read. Clocking in at about 110 pages, the graphic novel nonetheless deals with bipolarity in a way that can only be described as unflinching. Co-written by father-daughter pair Patrice and Émilie Guillon, with drawings by Sebastien Samson that seem to perfectly match the mood of the narrative, the story is told entirely in black and white — maybe it’s a stylistic choice, but it works well with the theme. Émilie, who appears as Camille in the comic, shares the many painful, intimate details of living with bipolarity. At times, it seems as though information is repeated, prompting assumptions of redundancy; one wonders, “Didn’t I already read that?” The answer is no, and that’s what makes this comic — otherwise an easily digested format — so difficult to read. The Guillon duo fully illustrates the circularity and repetitiveness of having a mental illness, showing that one step forward could lead to two steps back, over and over again.
When the story begins Camille is in Montréal with her boyfriend Julien, but soon returns home. Their separation, and his implied gaslighting, sows the seeds of the looming depression and suicidal thoughts that begin to govern her life for the next few years. One plot element largely withheld from the reader is a timeline: The story starts roughly in September 2001, and it is only near the end that another date is presented.
Camille’s journey, though chronicled through short stints in multiple facilities and six months spent working at Disneyland Paris, seems somewhat suspended in space. It’s hard to tell how much time has passed, a marker that incredibly powerful in conveying the toll mental health problems take, as well as the time needed to heal, recover, and become stronger in the face of what seems like a constant battle.
Patrice and Émilie have their own interspersed conversations throughout the graphic novel, breaking up the timeline. Through these interactions, they chronicle their decision to write a story about Émilie’s bipolarity in the first place. In these exchanges, it becomes clear that Émilie’s mental health, while much improved, is still shaky. Such a portrayal is honest: Getting better does not necessarily mean hitting a discrete point and never having to confront the problem again. Rather, it is a constant process.
The most heart-wrenching parts, are, arguably those when Camille attempts to hang herself — not confined to dialogue, these moments are shown through Samson’s illustrations — and when her mother seems to misunderstand her illness and reject her in the process. The former situation makes the abstract parts of mental illnesses real on the page for the reader, while the latter demonstrates that while support is often crucial for the struggling individual, it is difficult for family members to reconcile the illness. Yet both these moments are necessary for the story’s progression and to create an honest portrayal of Camille’s journey.
Late in the story, Camille and the reader discover that she does not have depression, exactly. Her illness is far more complex than that. Though this moment lasts for only a page, it’s striking: The doctor manages to convey to both audiences, in only a few words, how the illness manifests itself. It’s an educational moment without being obviously so.
Above all, the cyclical feeling of story likely has the greatest impact. Throughout the story, it feels as though Camille has already visited the same hospital, or seen the same doctor, or experienced the same symptoms of improvement and subsequent relapse. Such repetition is exactly the point, it reinforces the idea that working toward better mental health is by no means linear. Rather, it is an arduous process requiring time, patience, and the support of others. Even the ending itself is not decisively “happy,” precisely because there is no “end” regarding one’s health.
Perhaps one minor criticism is the perceived compression of the story: There has to be more to it, right? Such a contraction could be intended to preserve more painful details the public doesn’t need to know, but an equally plausible explanation is one that touches upon the recurring elements of the story. Were the comic to be longer, these moments, and their poignancy, would be lost. “States of Mind” succeeds not just because of its accessible format, fast pace, and dual narrative in past and present, but also because of its honesty and willingness to address a mental health issue in a way that, at times, might feel familiar to certain readers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Martha Hall Kelly’s “Lost Roses” weaves together the destinies of three women in an entertaining historical novel set at the brink of World War I. These women — Eliza Ferriday, Sofya Streshnayva, and Varinka — may be of different nationalities and socio-economic backgrounds, but the oncoming war is democratizing: Each must learn to survive in their own way as they face the complete upheaval of their lives.
The strength of “Lost Roses” lies in its compelling protagonists. As each woman narrates her own story, her voice and character become more distinct and moving. The portraits of these women are incredibly warm and personable, which is quite an accomplishment, considering the vast number of characters that exist within this world.
Eliza Ferriday is an American socialite and humanitarian living in New York City. Of wealthy New England stock, Eliza spends her time travelling around the world with her family until the onset of war changes her bourgeois lifestyle radically. When her best friend Sofya becomes trapped in Russia due to the war and the burgeoning Bolshevik Revolution, Eliza does all she can to aid her friend by supporting White Russian émigrées flooding into America, while also trying to track down Sofya. Eliza’s conflicts initially seem rather trivial, especially in comparison to the other women’s, yet the unexpected death of her husband Henry and building tensions between her and her teenage daughter Caroline add a lot more depth to her struggles and demonstrate just how strong of a character she really is. Meanwhile Sofya, a prisoner in her own home outside of St. Petersburg, is separated from her toddler son Maxwell and must do all she can to ensure her own survival in order to find him. She faces the most struggle, and it is her stalwart attitude which continually draws admiration. Her enduring friendship with Eliza also makes her stand out. Prone to a lack of sympathy, her love for Eliza reminds the reader just how tender she can be.
Other characters inspire just as much sympathy. Varinka is a young peasant girl who lives close to the Streshnayva estate. After the devastating death of her blacksmith father, Varinka must fend for herself and her ailing mother with the help of her father’s apprentice, Taras. Yet a stint in jail resulting from rebellious behavior has turned Taras into a cruel man who simultaneously controls, protects, and manipulates Varinka. Her job as a nanny to Sofya’s son Max initially presents itself as a great opportunity and an escape for Varinka, but with the eruption of the Revolution, she finds herself an equal to her employers at last. Though she struggles between hatred and loyalty for the Streshnayva’s, Varinka decides to take Sofya’s son, adopting Max as her own. Compared to the other women, Varinka has to grow up significantly more — but it is this arc which makes her even more interesting than the other characters.
Some of the characters, such as Eliza and Caroline, are based on the lives of real historical figures, making their stories all the more vivid. Even those who are products of Kelly’s own imagination, Sofya and Varinka, are based on diary accounts of women during this time period, formulating equally realistic characters. Kelly’s substantial research is at the core of her successful storytelling. Its sweeping images of the different cities also make use of this research, providing incredibly detailed scenes: “I urged Jarushka [my horse] along, past the captured German cannon proudly displayed in the Place de la Concorde and the Champs-Elysées and drove along the grand boulevards where the once majestic chestnut trees, thinning now, had been cut for firewood.”
While Kelly manages to captures scenes beautifully, entrenching her writing in detailed description and fact, certain big-picture elements are lacking. Though Kelly expertly inhabits the minds of each of these women, she seems to do so too effectively. It might be Kelly’s intention for the reader to experience Sofia’s naiveté in her narration, but Sofya’s committed belief to her family’s innate goodness and her belief that they are a better type of aristocrat than others is mind-blowingly naïve — to the point where her delusion is distracting. The novel doesn’t seek to be all too political, instead focusing on presenting a range of experiences, but allowing the story to be filtered through Sofya means the novel does not do enough justice to the causes of the Revolution.
The plot also relies too much on fortuitous encounters or else, reaches too far with its symbolism. This includes the roses from which the novel takes its name. Central to the story are a special breed of roses that are taken from the Ferridays’ Southampton home, which Sofya plants back in Russia. Sofya saves these from her garden while running away from the revolutionaries. Would Sofya, who is fleeing from armed men, half-starving and malnourished, really spend her time and energy saving flowers from a garden? Though they are important symbols of these women’s survival, the roses are simply unrealistic.
These kinds of issues can take away from a work that is incredibly well-researched and quite thoughtful. Even though some of the dialogue can be a bit awkward, the writing still manages to craft a profound relationships between characters. This is evident in the most complex relationship between Varinka and Sofya, which Kelly imbues with just the right amount of tension and trepidation. There are great elements to “Lost Roses,” but more often than not they are caught in the crossfire of extreme symbolism or frankly impossible coincidence.
