After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“To love is but to imagine well,” writes R.O. Kwon in “The Incendiaries,” her luminous debut novel. It’s somewhat of a throwaway line, but it embodies the novel in microcosm—that tenuous line between imagination and fantasy, the kind that can veer dangerously toward all-consuming obsession. It’s true of both erotic love and religious fanaticism. Love, like religion, requires a certain leap of faith—some grasping for the other side without the certitude of reciprocity, a blind offering of the self with all of its vulnerabilities laid bare.
With this fragile tension between love and religion, the scene is set for “The Incendiaries,” the simmering story of two university students, Phoebe Lin and Will Kendall, who both seek to fill a void in their lives. Will, who has severed ties with religious faith, fills “the God-shaped hole” with a worshipful longing for Phoebe, whom he comes to regard with reverent infatuation. “Sometimes,” Will thinks, “when I saw the girl in the flesh, she looked as implausible as all the Phoebes I’d dreamed into being.” For Phoebe herself, who is mourning the loss of her mother, different venues serve to distract from grief: Mastering the piano with militant discipline gives way to joining Jejah, the religious fundamentalist group led by John Leal, an enigmatic North Korean refugee. As Phoebe immerses herself more deeply into Jejah, Will is forced to reckon with the religion he abandoned in order to protect a girl he loves.
At 210 pages, “The Incendiaries” is a compact novel, but Kwon packs it with sublime detail and fully fleshed-out characters, whose richly imagined inner lives lend their intricate story a haunted depth. The novel makes no attempt to masquerade as a simple love story. Instead, its pages traverse the complex questions that define love, faith, and loss: what happens when love becomes obsession, when religious belief manifests in violent action, when deserted faith leaves a dangerous emptiness. “The Incendiaries” is less about the explosions that give the novel its name, and more about the spark that started the fire, and the slow burn of its consequences.
Kwon is a self-professed aesthete, and her meticulous deliberation over syntax—techniques that range from reading out loud to whiting out whole paragraphs, as described in an interview with the Atlantic—pays off. Her sentences are crisp, candid, and wrought with precision: In one scene, “ripped flip-flops still held the stain of footprints,” the symbolic vestiges of a past life. Later, Will “inhaled the lazy, bittersweet stink that lingered in her room from a hyacinth bouquet she’d let spoil in a vase… The rich hint of rot persisted.” It’s a lovely detail in and of itself, but it’s also thematically purposeful—an image of love cut with pollution, on the verge of rancidity. On occasion, though, rich detail slips into disorienting, borderline nonsensical abstraction: “Pop champagne to spout, like liquid mirth, from jeroboam bottles,” Kwon writes of a party. “Twirl the partiers. Set them to dance beneath the jasmine, florets dangling like bells from white-limbed pergolas.” Her sound is elegant, but sometimes indistinguishable from mere noise.
Kwon’s characters clearly have eyes for observation, but the novel’s narration sometimes dances with a coy ambiguity. Chapter headings would have a reader believe that the novel is narrated in turns by Will, Phoebe, and John Leal, but Kwon disabuses her reader of the presumption of accuracy, making it clear early on that this is merely Will’s representation of events, the narrative he pieces together by making imaginative leaps. “I’ll add what details I can,” he begins, sounding half-apologetic. True, certain discrepancies raise questions that go unanswered, even by the novel’s conclusion. Are John Leal’s harrowing accounts of North Korea—which waver in their consistency—factual reports or sensationalized fables? What is it, exactly, that drives Phoebe to seek out Jejah and to cling to it, despite its terrorist activity?
And, when distilled through Will’s narrative lens of privilege, is it important that Will is white and Phoebe is Korean? It’s difficult to read a relationship like Will and Phoebe’s and not scan the pages for an undercurrent of colonial tension, hyper-aware of any of the typical tropes that define this romance: a fetish for the so-called “exotic,” the submissive Asian woman, the dominating white male. An internship in Beijing heightens Will’s awareness of his dominance: “In physical fact, I was tall in Beijing. My stride extended long and tireless, a champion’s pace, fit for taking spoils, sizing land.” At times, Will treats Phoebe with a troubling ownership. Her slew of past love interests “predated me, she said, but I couldn’t help seeing the oil of all the hands, like starfish prints, staining Phoebe’s skin.” And beyond ownership, there is his willful mythologizing, his love for her becoming a kind of fanatical religious devotion: “With Phoebe, the walls lifted. Invitations spilled out; warmth, life.” Even her body is, for him, a sacred experience, “Phoebe’s tongue sliding between my lips, its salt taste the daily host.” Yet Kwon—who knows that the best novels never answer questions, rather pose them—never quite authorizes one verdict, instead leaving these facts behind for us to decide for ourselves.
Although this fraught politics permeates their relationship, admittedly, Phoebe wields a kind of subversive power over Will. Their introductory meeting, initially conveyed by Will as a happenstance drunken come-on, is ultimately revealed to be a choreographed advance on Phoebe’s part, one layered with purposeful intent. “Fine, I thought,” she thinks as she approaches him, then deliberately spills punch on his leg. “If I were less selfish,” she thinks later, “I’d have released the hold I had on him, this love-dazed Will, more child than man.”
Still, though Will paints a decent picture of her interiority, so much of the language about Phoebe is frustratingly conditional, each section prefaced with some variety of “She might have said,” or “I’m still not telling it right, though.” The lens narrative structure leaves us scrabbling for the innermost thought process that drives Phoebe to religious extremism, the machinery of her infinitely complex mind. Phoebe’s thoughts are all products of Will’s memory or imagination, a blatant facsimile. Here, Will takes on the ultimate power role: the one of the narrator. Only Will decides what Phoebe reveals, and therefore, what the reader knows. Godlike, he subsumes her words, her feelings, her story. One wonders how he has shaped her in his image.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The lawsuit lodged by the group Students for Fair Admissions against the University — challenging Harvard’s holistic, race-conscious admissions policies — has huge potential ramifications for affirmative action nationwide.
If the case makes it to the Supreme Court, affirmative action would face an existential threat, especially if Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh’s nomination is confirmed. Recognizing the potential of the case to undo affirmative action, the Department of Justice accused Harvard of racial discrimination in a court filing that paves the way for the federal government to sue and perhaps join the lawsuit.
In the face of these challenges, we reaffirm our vigorous support for affirmative action. It is foundational in building a diverse community, to the benefit of all parties, and develops a multicultural, meaningful experience for all members of the Harvard community. Thus, as it fights the lawsuit, the University should do its utmost in the trials to portray affirmative action in a positive light, and show how it makes campus a better place. Alumni networks and other universities could be valuable resources in this effort.
Nevertheless, in the face of this dire threat to the existence of affirmative action, Harvard must do more to defend it publicly.
From protecting immigrants who have temporary protected status to fighting for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and against the endowment tax, Harvard has been a leader among institutions of higher education in advocacy at the national level. University President Lawrence S. Bacow has thus far continued this tradition by promising to defend the values of higher education and condemning the new proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule that would make scientific data public.
Affirmative action is an issue of vital importance to Harvard — more so than most of the issues Harvard faces or has faced in the past. It directly affects how the University admits students, thereby affecting the student body and the composition of the University itself. As a result, Harvard has even more of an obligation to take any course of action necessary to defend it.
Perhaps one of the most effective ways to do this would be to take affirmative action to the court of public opinion. We urge the University to warn the public of the dangers of losing affirmative action, and to publicize its defense. Members of the administration should, for instance, write more op-eds, give more speeches, and appear at more public events specifically to espouse the benefits of affirmative action for not just Harvard, but the entire nation.
Regardless of one’s race, grade point average, SAT score, socioeconomic status, or any other single factor, no one is entitled to a spot at Harvard. The process is holistic for a reason — it would not benefit anyone to admit a class of very similar people. We’re all lucky — not entitled — to be here. Affirmative action has brought opportunities to those who would have otherwise never received them. Harvard must make a more public effort to protect it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this year, in April, on the second day of Visitas, there was a moment in which I, as I tend to be at that time of year, was in the midst of giving an impassioned speech to a group of pre-frosh, explaining why Harvard is superior to Yale, in every single way — and yes, that’s taking into account some of the uglier buildings on our campus — when, in one of the (rare) moments when I paused for breath, one of my friends interrupted me.
“But Shireen, don’t you hate Harvard?”
You see, when I’m mid-argument, I’m like a train, barreling on and on, and usually nothing can stop me; I just roll over any and all objections and I keep on going, and well, in the moment, my friend’s comment was no exception. I quickly dismissed her (valid) point by explaining that it’s not Harvard I hate, it’s the general culture of the Ivy League, and this culture thrives at Yale too, and, well, if someone is going to subject themselves to it, they should do so at the superior school.
(Which, of course, is and always has been and always will be Harvard.)
My friend laughed and the pre-frosh laughed and just like that, I was off again, train barreling top speed to my ultimate conclusion: Pick. Harvard.
But later that night, when I was walking back to my dorm, I thought about what my friend had asked. Because she had a point — mostly that she and everyone else who knows me had listened to me complain about Harvard, constantly, for all of sophomore year. And yet, it was somehow impossible for me to fathom the idea of another school being better.
For me, once the wonder of freshman year faded, the monotony of sophomore year set in. I was over my 14-hour days, tired of running from class to meeting to class to meeting to class, every single day, rinse and repeat. I felt other, like I was doing less than everyone else when really I knew I was doing too much. I felt other, stifled by a cutthroat campus where even friendships are made with the intent of networking. I felt other, out of the loop when my peers already knew the arguments of Thomas Hobbes or when they mentioned multitudes of friends at other Ivy League schools.
I still feel all this. But not always.
Sometimes, I walk through Dexter Gate, and I enter to grow in wisdom. Sometimes, I shop thirteen classes and end up desperately wanting to take nine of them. I go to lectures just to listen, I explore courses at the Divinity School and the Law School. I swipe into The Crimson, and I remember my own Visitas experience, how awed I was by even the prospect a college newspaper that had its own building and its own printing press. And I feel so lucky.

Sometimes, I pass by Annenberg minutes before a thunderstorm, and I stop, as if I’m a tourist, raise my phone and try to capture the beauty of my own freshman year dining hall, framed by the backdrop of thundering clouds. Sometimes, when the end of my day coincides with sunset, I walk back along the Charles, in the wake of a pink sky, and I feel at peace. And on the busiest days, if I have a few spare minutes, I climb up Widener steps and sit on the ledge so that my feet are swinging over nothing. I watch the tourists walk through the Yard, and I feel tall, and larger than my 5 foot 3 inches’ worth. And I feel at home.
Harvard is not an easy home. After all, I am still other. Many of us are. We did not go to fancy private (or fancy public) schools. We do not have parents who went here or even went to college at all. Harvard was not our legacy. And even barring the struggles of imposter syndrome and loneliness, these past two years have been tumultuous for me. There have been (many) moments where I think that if I could go back, I would not choose Harvard again. And yet, there have also been moments where I feel nothing but gratitude, nothing but wonder for this place that is ever growing and changing, and this place that I am growing and changing alongside.
Gratitude finds me in the most ordinary moments — every time I write this column, as a part of the organization I thought wouldn’t accept me freshman year. Or every time I warn a freshman of the perils of Ec10, and realize how far I’ve come. Or even every time I rush down Mass. Ave, running to yet another meeting, and for the first time in two years, don’t trip on broken up streets. Every one of these small moments is a reminder that finally, I too have found my footing.
And so, as someone who is known for “hating” Harvard, I want to say that I love being here. Yes, I criticize Harvard often and loudly, but its beauty and wonder still captivates me, and I hope always will. It is within these twin realities, of hate and love, of brokenness and beauty, that I have carved out a home for myself. And though I remain other, now, in many ways, I feel less so every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since the day I received my admissions letter, I have not stopped hearing that the mission of our University is to educate citizen-leaders not only for this country, but for the entire world. According to a plethora of administrators of every rank, Harvard is destined to produce people who will open new paths and set innovative standards in the fields of science, business, and politics. However, three years of campus life have convinced me that our university is largely failing to meet its noble aspirations.
Many voices will certainly object to this heretic claim and will point out that Harvard provides its students with a rigorous preparation for the vocation they would like to follow. With regard to politics, for instance, our university invites world-renowned speakers, organizes study groups and offers a wide range of classes on the tools of an effective administration. Yet, a true leader is not defined exclusively by his technical knowledge and his expertise over a particular subject. Instead, he is primarily distinguished by his composed character, his predilection for critical thinking, and his ability to persuade and inspire even those who initially tend to disagree with him.
In order to achieve the latter, the aspiring leader has to cultivate the faculty of compassion and understand the paramount importance of constructively engaging with the diverse viewpoints of  those around him. If he believes that there is a single formula for the maximization of social welfare and rejects any arguments that confront his ideological biases, he will sow the seeds of disunion and fail to mobilize the full potential of human energy. If, on the other hand, he puts himself in the shoes of others and tries to meaningfully respond to their concerns, as outlandish as they might seem at first glance, he will gain their respect and enthusiastic support.
Despite its undeniable merits, this model of empathetic leadership is not actively promoted at Harvard. To the dismay of many students who currently choose not to participate in any type of political activity, public discourse on campus is dominated by self-righteous and intransigeant vocal minorities. On the left, one can find several groups fighting for isolated issues of social justice, without integrating them into a coherent ideological agenda. In the meanwhile, on the right, it is easy to spot angry reactionaries who believe that intellectual enrichment can be attained by giving a platform to extremely controversial speakers. As a result, the two opposing sides end up exchanging thinly veiled insults and thinking that they have nothing in common. Inevitably, a question arises: Where do we go from here?
The answer lies in radically increasing the number of the opportunities available for people to express their political opinions through institutionalized fora. Study groups and speaker series are formative, but not at all sufficient for shaping well-informed leaders, because they do not enable their attendants to become active democratic agents. What Harvard needs, instead, is big campus-wide debates, in which students would employ normative arguments while confronting each other within a civil setting. Moreover, our university would benefit from the establishment of “thought societies,” clubs built around a common passion for a particular strand of political philosophy. These societies would hold regular discussions for their members and would organize intellectual mixers across ideological boundaries, a practice that has been tested with great success at other reputable establishments of higher education.
However, none of these measures would be effective if we did not face the elephant in the room: the lack of incentives for the involvement of our generation in political affairs. Unfortunately, Harvard as an institution cannot do much with regard to this dimension. It cannot force its students to be civic-minded and to sacrifice precious working time which could be dedicated to building a better resume for the demanding job market of today. That is why the responsibility of advancing a spirit of healthy concern for public welfare rests upon each one of us individually. Under no circumstances should we forget that Harvard is a true “city on a hill,” the most renowned and influential liberal arts college across the globe. Hence, we should always look beyond our narrow private interests and humbly put our hard-earned privileges in the service of the world.

Purple lights illuminated the granite exterior of Cambridge City Hall throughout last week, marking the beginning of the city’s recognition of National Recovery Month.
The color purple, symbolic of substance abuse and drug overdose awareness, is a hallmark of National Recovery Month, which is sponsored by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and strives to educate people about substance abuse and recovery every September.
In an email, Tali Schiller, substance abuse prevention coordinator for the Cambridge Public Health Department, wrote that Cambridge sponsored an opioid response training on Sept. 6 as part of its programming.
“The opioid response training was provided to city leaders not only because they could be potential bystanders to an overdose, but also to encourage other businesses and organizations to sign up for these type[s] of trainings, which are offered for free by the health department and the Access: Drug User Health Program,” Schiller wrote.
In Massachusetts, the number of confirmed opioid-related overdose deaths rose to 1,982 in 2017 as compared to 993 in 2013, according to a report by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. In Cambridge specifically, 12 overdose deaths were reported in 2017, versus six in 2013.
On Sept. 13 in Cambridge’s Central Square, the non-profit Access: Drug User Health Program held a memorial service called “A Celebration of Life and Survival” for people who have lost their lives to overdose and for people who have recovered from drug addiction.
The Cambridge Public Library will also host a screening of “Runnin’” on Sept. 17. The documentary focuses on the impact of opioid abuse on a group of friends in Somerville and the film’s director will answer audience questions after the screening.
“We are screening the documentary Runnin’ to humanize the people who are struggling with or have lost their lives to the disease of addiction,” Schiller wrote.
Schiller said the ultimate goal of Cambridge’s National Recovery Month is to destigmatize those who are dealing with substance abuse.
“Drug-related prejudice and stigma are incredibly strong barriers to seeking treatment for people who have a substance use disorder,” Schiller wrote. “This stigma is entrenched in the system, so that everything is harder for people who have had an addiction disorder. For instance, if you’ve been arrested for a drug-related crime, it can be hard to get a job or even housing.”
The Greater Boston area kicked off its own participation in National Recovery Month with a series of events on Aug. 31, including a public interfaith service for people affected by drug overdose and an advocacy group event to combat the stigma around addiction.

The Undergraduate Council and the Harvard Graduate Council plan to create a mentorship program this fall that will pair undergraduate and graduate students on the basis of common interests and career goals.
Catherine L. Zhang ’19 and Max Vani, who lead the UC and HGC, respectively, said the initiative marks the start of further collaboration between the bodies.
HGC is comprised of representatives from each of Harvard’s 12 graduate schools, including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Though GSAS students also elect a separate student council, the Graduate Student Council, HGC handles matters that affect all graduates students, including those at the Law School and Medical School.
Zhang and Kevin Tian, Vani’s predecessor, first discussed the possibility of a partnership between the UC and HGC in early 2018. After Vani took office in April, he and UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 met to formulate the outlines of a mentorship program, based on input they received from students.
Vani said the diversity of the graduate student community at Harvard means mentors can offer both professional and academic guidance to undergraduates based on their experience.
“What complicated things for the graduate council is that, unlike the undergraduates, we have 12 different schools which attract different kinds of students,” he said. “We have some that are professionally-oriented, where people come with years of professional experience, and then we have some like [GSAS] where the orientation is primarily academic.”
Before they are paired, prospective mentors and mentees will fill out a survey indicating the kind of advice they would like to receive and their experience.
“There’s a lot of interest...not only among graduate students to mentor, but also undergraduate students to be mentored especially with their academic fields of interest or just life paths,” Zhang said. “Many students who are now graduate students have had experience in the workforce and have come back or have specific interests than can be more tailored to undergraduate students.”
Undergraduates already have a myriad of opportunities to engage with mentors. The College assigns each student an academic advisor — oftentimes a graduate student or proctor — who approves class schedules and can offer career advice to the student. Freshman undergraduates can also seek counsel from upperclassmen Peer Advising Fellows.
Still, Zhang said there remains a need for an informal, graduate-undergraduate mentorship program.
“Graduate students...have a specific line of focus that undergraduate students that are interested can learn more about,” she said. “They’re oftentimes closer in age range...than say, faculty members, or professors, or your academic advisor, but a little further along than just your peers.”
“We’re excited to create a partnership that will last for years to come,” she added. “This is something that we’re hoping to institutionalize as well, to make sure we’re collaborating very effectively.”

This fall, the Computer Science Department is trying something new: a course that aims to bridge the gap between CS and the humanities through immersive, team-based projects.
According to its course description, CS100: “Software Engineering in the Arts and Humanities” involves the “applications of computer science ... to domains in the arts and humanities.” It is taught by CS professor David J. Malan ’99, who also teaches the wildly popular introductory CS course CS50: “Introduction to Computer Science.”
Unlike CS50, however, basic coding knowledge and an online application were both required to enroll in Malan’s latest offering. The current enrollment is 32 students.
CS100 is offered jointly with Yale University, where it has already been taught for one semester by Yale CS lecturer Benedict J. Brown ’99.
“The idea of this course is to ultimately help Computer Science students, and students across campus, learn about what goes on in research in different humanities disciplines,” Brown said. “All of them ask different sorts of questions and are approaching things in different ways, so it’s an opportunity to learn what goes on there and ask, ‘How can you use computing to help further that research?’”
In an emailed statement, Malan described the class in similar terms.
“We hope students concentrating not only in CS but in fields beyond CS will find it an opportunity to intersect disparate interests,” he wrote. “Indeed, it’s in the intersection of two fields, particularly those most disparate, that so many discoveries and creations surely await.”
CS100 tries to provide these intersections in a variety of ways — and many of them go beyond simple coding. Both Brown and Malan stressed the human interactions available through the course. For example, students will hear from humanities faculty at Harvard — including Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, a senior lecturer in Comparative Literature, and Peter Der Manuelian ’81, an Egyptology and archaeology professor — as well as faculty at Yale about the applicability of CS to their respective research.
Brown also mentioned that collaboration between Harvard and Yale students would be a central element of the course. He said that students working on similar projects might Skype each other and even meet in person through class trips.
“We’re working on organizing field trips to both campuses to visit some of the labs and facilities around digital humanities that each campus has to offer,” Brown said.
In the second half of the course, students from both schools will work in groups on a project within the realm of “digital humanities,” which Brown described as the application of technologies to traditional humanities disciplines. Malan offered several potential areas of research: students may look into the digital analysis of poetic meter, for example, or address the challenges of digitally curating artworks.
These projects will culminate in a project fair hosted by each school, with invitations to attend the events extended to students enrolled in the class at both Harvard and Yale, according to Brown.
Several Harvard students leaving the classroom Thursday said they appreciated the course’s unique focal point. Robert Roessler, a Ph.D. student in Germanic studies, said CS100 aligns naturally with his interests.
“In my dissertation I want to work exactly on the intersection of computer science and the digital humanities,” he said.
Despite his satisfaction with the course, Roessler said there is room for CS100 to grow in the future.
“One thing that I think might change, maybe next year or so, is that we do a little bit more than just JavaScript,” he said. “We might look at other stuff like topic modeling. That was actually something that I expected.”
For others, like Sewon Park ’21, CS100 is less a topic of dissertation-level study and more of an interesting way to explore the applications of computer science.
“I’m interested in CS and I want to pursue a secondary, but I didn't want to take the classic CS61 or CS121,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is still awaiting federal guidance on how to file taxes under a law passed in Dec. 2017 that levied an “unprecedented” excise tax on some universities’ endowment returns, according to University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson.
Harvard’s endowment, the largest University endowment in the world at $37.1 billion, would qualify for taxation under the the new tax codes Republican lawmakers passed last year. The University's endowment was previously exempt from taxes because the school is a non-profit entity.
Under the new law, Harvard would have paid an estimated $43 million on its endowment returns in 2017 had those been taxed, according to University administrators.
The new tax takes effect only for fiscal years starting after Dec. 31, 2017, and Harvard’s 2018 fiscal year began in July 2017. Endowment returns from fiscal year 2019 will be the first taxed under the new code, so Harvard won’t shell out money to the federal government until next year.
The new tax leaves much to be interpreted, though, and Jackson said the U.S. Treasury Department has still not provided guidance on how schools should file those taxes when they come due.
“We continue to await guidance from the Treasury Department on this unprecedented tax and in the absence of that it would be difficult for Harvard and other affected institutions to know exactly the impact and how it will all work,” Jackson wrote in an emailed statement.
Howard E. Abrams, a visiting professor at the Law School, said it’s common, especially after such a large tax overhaul, to see delays in guidance on each provision. An absence of official guidance does not, however, exempt taxpayers from filing.
“Even if there’s no guidance, the statute is enacted and taxpayers have to comply even if the Treasury doesn’t tell them how to handle all the details,” Abrams said.
Abrams said that without instructions, it might not be clear to universities what exactly is being taxed and how schools should consider each of their entities when filing.
Former University President Drew G. Faust and Harvard’s lobbyists in Washington lobbied extensively against the endowment tax before it was passed. In the months since the bill became law, University officials have continued to speak out about its negative impact on the school and push for its repeal.
Faust said in February the endowment tax would have “pretty significant” implications for the University.
“What [the endowment tax] will do is put constraints on our ability to fund the variety of undertakings that are central to our mission — financial aid and research, public programs, the variety of endeavors across the University," Faust said at the time. “Its ultimate impact will be on limiting the growth in the endowment, and the growth in the endowment is what funds the programs.”
Harvard’s fiscal year 2018 endowment returns have not yet been released, though they will likely become public in mid-September. Though they will not be taxed, they will provide the most up-to-date estimate for how much the University will likely owe next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of five millennial feminist activists, artists, and writers drew a crowd of more than 200 to the Radcliffe Institute’s Schlesinger Library on Thursday for a panel on contemporary feminism.
The Institute convened “Feminisms Now” in honor of the Schlesinger Library’s 75th Anniversary. The event highlighted how feminism has changed over time. The five panelists discussed the “intersectional” nature of 21st century feminism and reflected on their relationship with “second wave” feminist scholars and activists.
The sold-out event featured poet and screenwriter Fatimah Asghar, activists Dana Bolger and Emi Koyama, Monmouth University professor and author Melissa Febos, and cultural critic Kimberly N. Foster ’11.
History Professor Jane Kamensky, who helped organize the event, said organizers wanted to have an “intergenerational” conversation about the “plural nature” of contemporary feminism.
“We wanted to represent the variety of voices. The combination of art and activism was important,” Kamensky said.
She added the Schlesinger Library had hoped to get a young conservative women’s rights activist to join the panel, but their effort was unsuccessful as potential speakers declined the invitations.
All five panelists emphasized that feminism today is more conscious of “intersectionality” than it has been in the past. Intersectional feminism treats inequality as a web, with women situated in different places in that web based on different racial and socioeconomic identities as well as gender.
Koyama, a trans activist and writer, discussed how intersectionality can complicate old debates, using the example of who can use public bathrooms.
“In this debate about bathrooms, we think about trans people, we don’t think about the homeless people and people using drugs in public bathrooms because there are no other safe places to do so,” Koyama said.
“There are so many signs around Seattle where the sign says ‘all are welcome’ and then right next to that, ‘bathrooms are for customers only,’” she added. “We’re only thinking about whether privileged white trans women can use these bathrooms, but we need our public spaces reimagined radically, not just the genders.”
Women and Gender Studies Professor Robert F. Reid-Pharr, who moderated the panel, called Koyama’s idea “remarkable.”
Panelists also paid homage to older feminists who paved the way for feminists today.
“Citation is so important to me,” Foster said. “We are not the first people to do this, and while we’re altering our conversation in a very unique way, it’s also building on the shoulders of the people who came before.”
Activists on the panel spoke about how technology has changed feminism. Both Bolger and Foster started their activism online, where they said they could engage with women of different races, ages, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
Audience members said they liked hearing from diverse panelists, many of whom were different from speakers the Library typically hosts.
“It’s so important to provide space for people who are outside of who normally speaks at Harvard and is represented at these events,” Schlesinger Library employee Nikoleta Sremac said. “I’m so overwhelmed. It’s so thought-provoking, each panelist’s experience.”
The Schlesinger Library presented the event in partnership with VIDA, an organization that advocates for gender parity in the publishing industry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
White students at elite universities tend to view affirmative action favorably — most often because they believe diversity benefits them personally, according to a study published this summer by Harvard Graduate School of Education Professor Natasha K. Warikoo.
Warikoo interviewed almost 100 white students on the campuses of Harvard, Brown, and Oxford as part of her research, which she published in August in the academic journal Social Sciences. She found that white students’ support for affirmative action typically stems out of “self-interest.”
“It was sometimes problematic because they saw affirmative action as something to benefit themselves, rather than a policy that’s about justice or racial equity or access,” Warikoo said in an interview.
A 2017 Pew Research Center poll found that 71 percent of the American public agrees that policies “designed to increase the number of black and minority students on college campuses are a good thing.” The Crimson’s 2018 freshman survey found that 58.6 percent of respondents in the Class of 2022 view affirmative action favorably. Almost 65 percent of the class took the survey.
Warikoo said her research also demonstrated that white students typically believe they won admission to their respective schools based on merit alone. By contrast, many white undergraduates said they believe black and Latinx students benefited from affirmative action during the admissions process.
Universities’ annual publication of their acceptance rates, Warikoo writes in the study, “might further students’ beliefs in the legitimacy of their status position as elites.” She advocated for ending this practice.
Stanford recently announced plans to do exactly that, though its admissions data will likely remain public because the school is required to give that information to the federal government. In the meantime, most of Stanford’s peers are sticking with the status quo — including Harvard. College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement last week that Harvard will continue to publish its acceptance rates.
Harvard and Stanford have both seen rapidly dropping admit rates in recent years. Stanford’s rate dipped below 5 percent for the first time with the Class of 2020; Harvard followed suit two years later with the Class of 2022.
Warikoo wrote in the study — and said in an interview — that she believes a lotteried admissions process could help reduce inequality at the nation’s elite universities, provided that schools make “provisions” for diversity and other “qualities of interest.” Under this system, students who meet certain academic standards would be entered into a lottery and would win acceptance mostly at random.
“An admissions lottery would shift the meaning of selection from an absolute sense of merit — the best of the best — to an understanding that admission is somewhat arbitrary,” Warikoo wrote in the study. “Less dramatically, universities might better signal the meaning of admission to their universities.”
Warikoo’s study comes as Harvard is taking serious legal and federal heat over its use of affirmative action in its admissions process. The College is facing a four-year-old lawsuit in federal court that alleges it discriminates against Asian-American applicants. The Justice Department, which is conducting a separate investigation into similar allegations, recently signaled it supports the plaintiff in that suit, anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions.
The suit is slated to go to trial in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15.

It’s been a long time since Harvard was in any way affiliated with the historically all-male final clubs that surround its campus.
The clubs — at the time, there were nine — severed ties with the University in 1984 after administrators delivered an ultimatum: admit women as members or part ways with Harvard.
“These clubs must come to terms with the changing role of women in society and learn to associate with them in college as associates and colleagues, and not merely as romantic and sexual partners,” then-Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III said in Oct. 1984, according to the New York Times.
Nearly 40 years later, history is in some ways repeating itself.
Harvard announced sanctions on members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations in May 2016. The penalties — which took effect with the Class of 2021 — bar members of these groups from holding campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captancies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
But this time around, some all-male final clubs are proving less defiant.
The Spee, the Fox, and the Delphic — all three among the original nine that split from Harvard in the eighties — recently promised to surrender their single-gender status in exchange for official Harvard recognition and freedom from the College’s sanctions.
The 2018 relationship between these clubs and the University promises to differ substantially from the one that existed 40 years ago. Prior to 1984, Harvard did not formally recognize the final clubs and did not seriously intervene in their membership policies — but did grant them perks including use of the school’s private phone line and a discount on steam heating.
Today, Harvard is significantly more hands-on. Administrators require recognized clubs to submit demographic breakdowns of their membership, offer up governing documents, and prove their alumni boards are not exerting undue influence over undergraduate members. (And there’s been no public mention of discounted heating.)
“The new protocols, from what I understand of them from the Crimson, bear little similarity to the old ones, which were simple in the extreme,” former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 wrote in an email.
Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78, the graduate president of the Fly Club — which, in lieu of admitting women, is taking the fight against the sanctions to Capitol Hill — put it a little more bluntly.
Harvard’s new approach, he said, could be termed “in loco helicopter parentis.”
Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who served as Harvard’s dean of freshmen for over a decade before he retired last spring, still remembers his days as an undergraduate member of the Delphic.
Back then — in the late sixties — the living was easy, Dingman said.
“The College had very little involvement in the final clubs when I was an undergraduate,” Dingman said. “They had their own real estate, they had graduate boards, they were largely self-contained communities.”
Despite their lack of official Harvard recognition, the clubs benefited from privileges typically offered only to groups that maintained a formal relationship with the College.
Harvard allowed the final clubs to hold events in some University-owned spaces and to make calls on the school’s Centrex telephone system, according to the New York Times. Other perks included access to the school’s private alumni address book and free guidance from Harvard University Police Department officers on security.
Nearly all clubs purchased steam to heat their mansion clubhouses at a reduced price from Harvard Building and Grounds. The groups paid over 10 percent less than the going rate in Cambridge.
“Although they are private, in many ways they are treated as if they were a recognized student organization at Harvard,” Epps told The Crimson in 1983.
The ties between the clubs and the University extended to the literal ground underneath members’ feet.
Harvard at one point owned a plot of land in the Fly Club’s garden, on which it paid taxes. And administrators granted the Delphic Club a coveted parking spot in Apley Court. The 19 other spaces in the lot belonged to high-ranking administrators.
Epps did exert some control over club affairs, helping oversee the groups’ punch every fall — the process by which final clubs have historically selected and inducted their members. A formal agreement signed by all nine clubs stated Epps should “call” and act as chairman of meetings held between the clubs’ undergraduate presidents.
But Epps told The Crimson in 1983 that he was never a major player in club affairs.
“I guess I would be a resource person, and if a problem arose, I would be there to mediate it,” he said, adding that he attended the meetings not out of a desire to help the clubs, but because he wanted to guard the interests of College students.
Porteus said he thinks Harvard administrators mostly stayed out of the way because, at the time, the clubs restricted their social events to members.
“The clubs in the seventies were primarily members-only and, as their memberships have diversified to accommodate the increasing diversity of Harvard, they've also — many or most — experimented with different kinds of guest policies,” Porteus said.
Dingman remembered it the same way.
“There was very little opening of doors to accommodate large numbers of undergrads,” he said.
Nowadays, final clubs often hold large and sometimes raucous parties on Friday and Saturday evenings. When administrators debuted the sanctions, they initially cited sexual assault at alcohol-fueled club events as a justification for the penalties — though they've since backed away from that rationale, shifting their reasoning at least twice.
In 2018, Harvard is once again offering final clubs certain perks.
But — unlike in the past — they come with serious strings attached. Harvard last semester designed and unveiled a complex, three-tiered system of recognition that heaps escalating benefits on clubs that demonstrate greater compliance with administrative directives and priorities.
All social groups must submit their governing documents and anonymous gender breakdowns of their membership to the College in order to be considered for the lowest level of recognition, “Interim Recognition,” which confers freedom from the sanctions for at least one year.
The two higher levels —  “Full Recognition” and “Recognition with Distinction” — sweeten the bargain by offering clubs unspecified amounts of Harvard cash. In return, groups must commit to total non-discrimination in their membership policies.
And administrators appear to be targeting some groups’ powerful graduate boards. The College has stated it will deny recognition to clubs whose alumni bodies wield undue clout in the groups’ day-to-day operations.
In a recent interview, Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller declined to specify what inappropriate graduate board influence might look like, but said generally that Harvard will weigh the amount of financial control exerted by alumni.
Today’s level of administrative involvement in club matters might have surprised John B. Fox Jr. ’59, who served as dean of the College around the time administrators first ordered the nine clubs to go co-ed. In interviews with The Crimson, Fox indicated he viewed the groups as rightfully separate from Harvard.
“It has not been my view that these clubs are in any way a part of the range of opportunities provided by the College, and I do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak out,” Fox told The Crimson in 1983. “I don’t often comment on the decisions students make in their private lives.”
Still, Fox was likely more active in club affairs than his 2018 administrative counterparts in at least one way. In 1983, he was invited to the Porcellian Club’s annual spring bash — an invitation he accepted.
“I was invited by an undergraduate, not by the club,” he told The Crimson at the time. “I try to respond to invitations by undergraduates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ask captain Zach Miller what motivated him this offseason and he will give you a very simple answer.
“From the second we left for Thanksgiving break guys were grinding,” Miller said. “We’ve been working on it for nine months because we know the feeling of going 5-5. We know the feeling of seeing Yale walk off the field 9-1, beating us, winning the Ivy League Championship, putting a sour taste in our mouths. We’ve been working with that in the back of our minds every day.”
Harvard football had nothing to play for but pride when it entered the Yale Bowl last Nov. 18, and even pride escaped the Crimson by the end of the fourth quarter. Harvard was at the tail end of one of its worst seasons in recent memory — which says a lot, considering the team still did not fall below .500 — and to make matters worse, rival Yale dominated for a full 60 minutes. The Bulldogs triumphed, 24-3, and cemented themselves as Ivy League champions.
The Crimson has not had a losing season since 1998 when the team went 4-6, but head coach Tim Murphy’s main goal this fall is not necessarily to recapture the dominance that the squad displayed throughout the 2000s and into the 2010s. Rather, Murphy wants Harvard to “reach [its] full potential” following a rare down season.
“I know that that particular goal isn’t necessarily quantitative, but to me that’s the most important goal, whether that is to reach our potential and win every single game and an Ivy League Championship, or just to maximize whatever our talent level is,” Murphy said. “Beyond that, to be a better football team than we were a year ago, stating the obvious.”
The first stop on the Crimson’s road to improve its fortunes is a tough one. Harvard will kick off its season by hosting the University of San Diego, which received one vote in the FCS Coaches Poll and went 10-1 in the 2017 regular season before bowing out of the second round of the playoffs to perennial contender North Dakota State. The Toreros already have two games under their belts — the first a 38-9 drubbing of Western New Mexico and the second a 54-21 loss to UC Davis, which received 29 votes in the Coaches Poll.
In the two teams’ most recent meeting in 2013, the Crimson traveled to San Diego for its season opener and doubled up the Toreros, 42-20. Harvard took 2012’s matchup as well, winning at home, 28-13.

Murphy and his team describe San Diego as an extremely physical team on both sides of the ball. It runs an under-center offense that features a brutal running attack and highly synchronized play-action passes over the top.
The quarterback in charge of the Toreros’ Stanford-style offense is Anthony Lawrence. The redshirt senior was named to the STATS FCS Walter Payton Award watch list before this season, and for good reason. In 2017, Lawrence threw for 3,131 yards, had 33 touchdowns to just three interceptions, and completed 65.5 percent of his passes.
Countering Lawrence and San Diego will be a veteran-heavy Crimson team, with a few younger impact players sprinkled in. The veteran presence that already existed on last year’s defensive unit will be replicated, as numerous players elected to play a fifth year, including Miller. The offensive unit also features a number of seniors who have previously played important roles on the team.
Starting at quarterback on Saturday, though, will be sophomore Jake Smith. In his rookie campaign, Smith showed flashes of brilliance alongside expected growing pains. Now entering his second season, he plans to take advantage of tireless offseason workouts and increased comfort with Harvard’s system.
“I’d say my confidence is at an all-time high right now,” Smith said. “Last year I was kind of thrown in the fire, kind of had to learn on the go. I think just the fact that I’ve gotten so many reps over however many months has just really made me feel a lot more comfortable.”
According to Smith, improved arm strength and decision-making will be key to his development in his second year quarterbacking the Harvard team.
One side effect of the Crimson’s stacked roster of upperclassmen is that freshmen will have to work that much harder to see on-field action.
“At any level, whether you’re Alabama, Harvard, Stanford, or Amherst College, it’s challenging to make an impact right away, and part of it is in the Ivy League you lose a lot of practice and meeting time in the preseason because of freshman orientation,” Murphy said. “If you’re going to compete for a championship, it’s pretty much going to be on the broad shoulders of your upperclassmen.”
Despite the fact that so many key pieces of Harvard’s roster have three or more seasons of experience under their belts, week one is often chock-full of unknowns. However, the Crimson aims to use this to its advantage as it prepares to suit up against the Toreros on Saturday.
“When they come in they’ve only had four or five days to prep for us, and we’ve been focusing on them since the beginning of the preseason,” Miller said. “We’re hungry.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a thrilling back-and-forth affair, Harvard women’s volleyball (3-4) took down previously undefeated Boston College (9-1) in five sets. Momentum swung like a pendulum, with each team trading a win for a loss in each resulting set. After the Eagles forced a fifth and final set, the Crimson took home the final set 15-11.  Senior captain and middle blocker Christina Cornelius and junior middle blocker Sope Adeleye came up with the final dagger on a block that sealed the victory. Cornelius’s 14 kills and 13 digs were both good enough for team-highs for Harvard.
With the pressure on entering the deciding set, the Crimson showed poise and precision in jumping out to an early lead. Harvard scored the first three points of the fifth set, and the Crimson kept the pressure on by going up 5-1 early on in the set, forcing a Boston College timeout. Of Harvard’s first five points of the last set, Adeleye and fellow junior middle blocker Maclaine Fields were responsible for a pair of kills each in the initial 5-1 run.
Coming out of the timeout, the Eagles slowly chipped away at the lead to make the score 10-8 Crimson. Harvard turned up the pressure again, going on a quick three-point run. The spurt proved to be fatal for Boston College, as it was unable to overcome the large 13-8 deficit. The Eagles were able to score twice preventing the Crimson’s match point, but a final block gave the set, and the match, to Harvard.
Although the entire match proved to be a tug-of-war, the first set started very streaky. the Crimson opened up the night by scoring the first seven points. However, with the score 8-1, Boston College put together a run of its own, grabbing back four straight points.
After some back-and-forth play, the opening set became tied at 19. Both squads traded points a few times, with Harvard eventually gaining the upper hand at 24-23. Junior outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank delivered a kill that ended the threat for the Crimson.
The second set also saw dramatic swings in momentum. Boston College jumped out to an early lead, but Harvard thundered right back, tying the set at nine and even holding a two-point lead as late as 18-16. The game remained within one point until the Crimson ran out of gas. Leading 20-19, the Eagles turned up the heat and quickly struck for five consecutive points to take home the second set and even up the score.
The third set mirrored the entire night, with neither side willing to give up any ground without a fight. The point differential between the two squads did not climb above two until Harvard took a 19-16 lead late in the set. This little spark of momentum would prove to be enough. A kill by sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry made the score 20-17 Crimson, sparking a four-point run that put Harvard within striking distance of taking the set. With an attack error by Boston College junior Cat Balido, Harvard had regained the momentum.
Typical of the night, that momentum was lost as quickly as it was gained. In a do-or-die set for the Eagles, Boston College jumped out to a quick 3-0 start. Harvard clawed its way back, tying the game at nine on another Mabry kill. The familiar tug-of-war continued throughout much of the set, with the Crimson hoping to end the night early and the Eagles fighting to stay alive. Down 22-21, Harvard used a timeout in an attempt to swing the game back in its favor. Roberts Burbank delivered a kill out of the timeout to tie the score once again, however this set would look much like the other even-numbered set earlier in the night. The Crimson again seemed to run out of gas, allowing three straight Boston College points that forced a fifth set. Ultimately, the see-saw seemingly controlling the night tipped towards Harvard again, as the Crimson took home the final set to secure the victory.
Fields led the way in the final set with four of her 11 total kills coming in crunch time. Her solid play elevated Harvard at the end of the game to its third straight victory over its crosstown rival, its second straight coming in five sets. The win proved even more impressive as it delivered the Eagles its very first loss of the season. Harvard hopes to finish the weekend strong before starting conference play.
