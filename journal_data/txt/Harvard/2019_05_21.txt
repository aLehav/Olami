Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang’s 1986 feature, “Dao Ma Zei” (“The Horse Thief”), is one of 19 films to be presented as a Cannes Classic film in this year’s festival. The film features naturalistic and abstract cinematography and follows the journey of Norbu, a Tibetan shepherd who steals horses to help his family in hard times. When he’s caught, his family is forced into exile, and his son’s death drives him to start stealing again. The Chinese government censored some of the Tibetan ritual scenes and added a note that this film took place before 1950, which is when Chinese troops first entered Tibet.
In 1993, Tian presented his feature, “The Blue Kite,” at Cannes, despite the fact that it was banned in China. The film, which tells the story of a boy growing up under the changing times of Mao’s Great Leap Forward, went on to win the Grand Prix and Best Actress Award at the Tokyo International Film Festival that year. Because of the subject matter of the film, the Chinese government suspended Tian Zhuangzhuang from filmmaking for a year. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson on Saturday, Tian discussed his current project, a film that is set in China during the cultural revolution of the late ’60s and early ’70s, when he was a teenager. He said that the film, loosely based on a novel, is still in its early stages, and he also plans on drawing from his personal experiences.
Editor's note: A translator was present during the interview, and this interview has been edited for clarity.

The Harvard Crimson: What makes “The Horse Thief” a classic?
Tian Zhuangzhuang: That, I really don’t know. I think the Cannes Classics, from my point of view, is more for the preservation of the film. I first came into contact with preserving films 10 or 20 years ago, when Martin [Scoresese]’s project started. He has been preserving all the works that he thinks are classics. He found funding in Italy and some other countries and an organization to do the work. Now, after so many years, the preservation technology has really been advanced and digitized, and it’s made a lot of older works accessible these days. This is a really important thing for the film industry because it’s not inherent — it’s a continuous process that you move along the narrative and history. So “The Horse Thief” is one part of that narrative. It’s not anything special.
THC: “The Horse Thief” explores some of the problems of China in the ’80s. How does it relate to the present?
TZ: Everyone has different feelings and views when watching these old films. “The Horse Thief” is a story about belief, death, and how to survive. No matter which generation you’re from, you’ll always have to think about that. Because at the time, I just experienced the biggest political movement at the time, The Cultural Revolution, of course I was thinking about these themes. Using a Tibetan story is easier to tell than using a Han Chinese story, which would be more complex. Film is not that definite, the edges aren’t that sharp. There’s no clear definition of the lines between everything. That’s why everyone thinks the film represents what they’re thinking, but you would also never see it in real life. That’s why I think it’s interesting to have discussions about a film. It’s more fun.
THC: “The Horse Thief” is also pretty sparse in dialogue. Is that to leave more interpretation for the viewers?
TZ: It’s really because I don’t know how to write dialogue — that’s why there’s not much. I think it’s the hardest to write. Because it’s hard to use someone else’s words, like a character’s, to say what you want to say. But I think that the less dialogue, perhaps the easier it is for people to watch and understand. Sometimes language is a communication system that is unique to where you’re from or a particular community. For example, I don’t understand English, so if you give me an English film I won’t understand the dialogue.
Back in the day of silent films, everyone in the world could understand the films. The movies themselves had their own language. People now are lazier. They think dialogue can explain everything, and it’s easy to write a dialogue and do a translation. So the language of films themselves now has a different direction, like advertisements or TV commercials. I’m not criticizing dialogue in movies, but I think that the most captivating thing about films is its own language of expression.
THC: Did you form most of these ideas from your studies at the Beijing Film Academy?
TZ: Part of it, at least. The teachers at the academy didn’t really talk about these things. When I was in school, all the teachers were teaching Soviet Union films. But back then, the films were spectacular, like Soviet Union films in the ’40s, ’50s, ’60s, were brilliant films, but did not have a lot of dialogue and a lot of imagery.
THC: Who is the target audience for your next film?
TZ: I try to make films for this century. No director doesn’t want their films to be seen by the people of their age. But sometimes you’ll create films that have completely different tastes from your general audience. That is fate. That’s fate’s problem, and there’s nothing you can do about it. That’s why sometimes I don’t dare make films. I don’t want to repeat some of my previous experiences.
THC: What’s the state of the censorship bureau currently?
TZ: We don’t know yet. You need to try and then you’ll find out. Censorship is like a spring — it’s tangible. You have to push the edge, the boundary, to have some risk to see whether you’ll be affected by [censorship] or not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robert Eggers’ sophomore feature, “The Lighthouse,” finds two lonely men who have just arrived to an island in the middle of nowhere, rocked by fantastical forces that wait to be awakened. Like his 2015 film “The Witch,” the film focuses on a destitute people driven mad by invisible forces and each other: Set sometime in the 1890s, lightkeeper Thomas Wake (Willem Dafoe) and Ephraim Winslow (Robert Pattinson) laboriously tend to a lighthouse that doesn’t draw in any seafarers, but seems to have a deranged effect on its caretakers.
As the two characters descend into full-blown mania, it becomes hard to differentiate between their nightmares and reality. Therein lies the beauty of “The Lighthouse”: It could be a ghostly horror movie, or a complete vision of delusion, but it’s really a combination of both. So as Winslow is tortured by fantasies of sensual mermaids and murderous seagulls, the viewer is also looped into the chaos and confusion — but has the degree of separation to revel in it. Blending madness and magic, “The Lighthouse” is simultaneously horrifying and beautiful, like a nautical myth come to life, with just the right amount of ambiguity to fuel its intrigue.
Over the course of four bleak weeks, young Winslow is tasked with all the manual labor in and around the lighthouse. Thomas, on the other hand, makes it absolutely clear that upkeep of the light itself — that is, the top of the lighthouse enclosed in glass — is strictly his duty. This penchant for declaration without explanation defines Thomas, who speaks in an obsolete maritime dialect and is dogmatically superstitious, warning Winslow that it’s bad luck to kill a bird or not finish a toast: “God who hear’st the surges roll, deign to save a suppliant soul,” he toasts before every meal. By some stroke of misfortune, a violent storm hits the island the day they are supposed to leave. As tensions rise between the two, so does Winslow’s curiosity about Thomas’s backstory and his secrets — luckily for Winslow, however, Thomas has little interest in his past: “Your guilty conscience is as tiresome and boring as any guilty conscience,” he dismisses him.
Egger couples these rising tensions with provocative imagery and sound, often imbuing otherwise abject subjects with an eerie beauty. Cinematographer Jarin Blaschke’s 35mm black and white stock paints the film with a grainy, harrowing feel that evokes an old photograph — and the material world is true to the period, from their long johns to wooden lobster nets. The sheer darkness of the film, which is only briefly accentuated by daylight or a gas lamp, puts into stark relief the only source of constant light, the lighthouse, which seems to possess a spirit of its own: Winslow witnesses a naked Thomas standing in its light, struck motionless by its power. A blaring foghorn frequently sounds — but no ships ever come ashore.
In order for a film to succeed with only two actors, both must be absolutely spectacular, and they are. “The Lighthouse” sees Pattinson’s best performance yet as Winslow, who’s set on getting a fresh start. With a droopy moustache, weathered skin, and a lit cigarette always hanging out the side of his mouth, Pattinson is almost unrecognizable in appearance and demeanor. He conceals a bubbling anger under a reticent countenance, though he does occasionally defy Thomas, who finds any and all work he does unsatisfactory. And when he does unleash his fury, Pattinson rises to the occasion and indulges his anger, hurling out insults in rapid succession or smashing a seagull to absolute shreds — he is so sensational that even his inconsistent British accent is forgivable.
Dafoe is equally adept in his role as the bearded, limping old seaman who considers the sea the only woman he will ever need, and the energy between him and Pattinson is electric. With a sharp Melville-inspired screenplay written by Eggers and his brother, Max Eggers, the two characters come together as a bitingly funny and erratic spectacle, drunkenly singing and dancing just minutes before damning each other to death because of a sly remark, which quickly becomes their nightly routine. Their banter is insulting and extreme, delivered with threatening clarity. “Let Neptune strike ye dead, Winslow!” Thomas finishes his furious monologue after Winslow insinuates that he doesn’t like his cooking. They usually need a few too many swigs of liquor to express any semblance of fondness toward each other, though they quickly revert to the condescending-boss-resentful-worker dynamic during the day, a transition that the skilled actors handle with ease.
Full of suspense and fantasy, “The Lighthouse” is a nightmarish masterpiece that is captivating from beginning to end. Though the film somehow isn’t up for any awards, this epic of maritime madness is certainly a standout at this year’s Cannes, and cements Eggers as an emerging talent to look out for.

I make the mistake of telling myself that maybe I’d be up for an 8:30 a.m. screening again. That does not happen. Instead, I get to do my first interview at the festival with Chinese director Tian Zhuangzhuang, who’s presenting his 1986 film “The Horse Thief” as part of this year’s Cannes Classics collection. While walking around the fifth floor of the Palais, where the interview is supposed to take place, I meet two friendly journalists from Spain who are also there or the interview, and just as lost as I am. After finding the room at last, we get down to business. The director is lovely, and the half hour passes by quickly.
I scurry to my first screening of the day, which happens to be a Chinese film too. It's a premiere of drector Diao Yinan’s “Nan Fang Che Zhan De Ju Hui” (“Wild Goose Lake”) in the Grand Theatre Lumière: the largest and most glamorous theater at Cannes, and where the Competition films officially premiere, usually with the crew and cast in attendance. It’s my first time stepping inside the theater here, since there are usually press screenings happening at the same time in other theaters that are half the hassle of getting in, but I decide that I need to attend a screening at the Lumière at least once. I’m neither an A-Lister nor involved the film nor do I write for Hollywood Reporter — you get the point — so I get rounded up in a large mass to the less desirable balcony section.
As I’m scrolling through #Cannes2019 Tweets and the hot takes of the day in my seat, I suddenly hear cheers and the crowd erupt into clapping. I look up, but see that everyone in the row in front of me is already standing. Slightly annoyed, I stand up too, and do a complete double take when I see Quentin Tarantino with his wife in arm walk through the aisle on the main floor of the theater. Though I wished I was sitting down below earlier, I was now enjoying a nice birds-eye view of Tarantino, reminding me of my excitment to see his new film, “Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood,” which is also premiering at Cannes. Just a few more days!
It’s raining, and after watching someone get killed gruesomely with an umbrella in “Wild Goose Lake,” I felt a bit claustrophobic walking outside into a mass of opening umbrellas. Maybe the week is wearing me down, but as I weave through the glamorous stars walking the red carpet, their umbrellas create impenetrable bubbles around them, making them seem at once more stylish and untouchable. The cast and crew for “Port Authority,” which I see next, are all at the screening, and one of the dancers from the cast even gets up on stage and vogues for a bit as the credits start rolling when the film ends. The music and dancing pumps me up, reboosting my energy at the end of a long day.
I grab what I thought to be Greek yogurt at a corner store before heading back to the Airbnb. Upon opening the container, I see a whipped curdle-like, white substance. I look again at the label: “Gervita,” it reads (in my defense, Gervita and Greek start with the same letter, and I was hoping it was some French branding tactic). I do a quick Google search (which, honestly, I should have just done in the store) and realize that what I’ve bought instead is “a delicate cloud of mousse combined with a creamy white cheese.” A mousse of what? I take a spoonful of it. It tastes kind of like yogurt, but much, much richer. Actually, it tastes more like butter than it does yogurt. It’s so rich that I imagine my arteries clogging up. I gulp. But it’s late, I’m hungry, and I still have to wrap up my reviews from the day, so I gobble it down anyways. So much for improving my French.

In “The Mother-in-Law,” Sally Hepworth explores what it means to be part of a family. She weaves a careful tale of murder, lies, and hatred that takes place in modern day Australia. Though the plot is not wildly original or particularly gripping, “The Mother-in-Law” possesses a surprisingly engaging cast of characters that helps craft a somewhat compelling book out of a feeble, simplistic mystery.
From the start, the plot zeroes in on the fabulously wealthy Goodwin family: the stoic matriarch Diana, her kind and generous husband Tom, their good-humored adult son Ollie, and their quiet businesswoman daughter Nettie. Additions to the family include Patrick, Nettie’s lazy and rather callous spouse, and the motherly Lucy — the primary narrator. This is a role she shares with Diana, who narrates events of the past. Lucy’s narration mainly takes place in the present day, but flashes back to events that occurred since her engagement. Diana’s narration often compliments Lucy’s, sometimes retelling events from her perspective. This second perspective turns out to be important, since Diana’s actions are so influenced by her past and the narration explains her often perplexing behavior.
For the most part, the plot focuses on the murder of the matriarch and its aftermath. Though Diana is initially thought to have committed suicide by poison, the police suspect foul play when they discover that no poison is found in her system – rather, they find that she was suffocated to death. Lucy then tries to understand what happened that day to the woman with whom she has always had an antagonistic and turbulent relationship.
The chapters in the past focus on each narrator’s history as well as their developing relationships with each other. Diana, who runs a charity helping pregnant refugee women in Australia, loses patience with her middle-class daughter quite easily. She finds Lucy entitled, too eager to place, even a little helpless. In spite of her wealth, Diana had a rather rough adulthood: Even though Diana grew up quite happily in a Catholic middle-class household, an unexpected pregnancy in her late teens changed everything.
Of course, there are times where her coldness towards Lucy is rather ridiculous — you can’t simply hate someone because they have had an easier life than your own. While sometimes Lucy feels obnoxiously privileged, to constantly disparage or begrudge her for not being an Afghan refugee feels rather unfair — a frequent comparison and criticism that Diana makes. Still, Diana’s dislike ends up making her narration quite humorous: “The engagement came faster than I expected — within the year. Ollie announced it at dinner one night, wearing the same proud smile he’d worn at two years old when he’d carried in a dead bird from the garden.” Descriptions like these are the perfect combination of biting and hilarious, and they capture her dynamic personality.
Though the reader feels some sympathy for Lucy, it’s often hard to connect with her. This makes reading this book rather difficult to become immersed in as it is primarily concerned with Lucy’s psychology and struggles. Lucy, whose own mother died when she was quite young, searches for a mother-figure in Diana, only to find criticism and dismissal. It can be challenging to understand Lucy’s empathic hatred for her mother-in-law at times. Sure, Diana is cold and judgmental, but this attitude is never specifically directed at Lucy. As many of the other character’s insinuate, Diana is simply a cold woman, one who even treats her children in this way.
Some of Diana’s more aggressive or direct remarks against Lucy don’t match up to the hatred that Lucy feels. Diana coming empty handed to her daughter-in-law’s delivery room doesn’t deserve Lucy’s subsequent rush of loathing. The book seems to be self aware about its absurdity, because it introduces more offensive acts worthy of disdain such as when Diana turns off a baby monitor during dinner against Lucy’s wishes or when Diana takes her infant grandchildren swimming despite their mother’s request not to. Because so many of these actions call into question Lucy’s role as a mother, it is easier to understand where Lucy’s immense frustration and anger come from. The earlier examples of Diana’s mistreatment, however, make Lucy out to be unreasonable. This is disappointing considering how well the narrations usually captures Lucy’s emotions and thoughts.
Generally speaking, Hepworth is devoted to her female characters. As Diana remarks in her narration, “In the back of my thoughts it occurs to me that Ollie is the fruit of my womb, yet at some point he’s become almost insignificant. He and Tom and Patrick are the cogs and spokes, but Lucy and Nettie and I we are the wheels.” The attention to the women in the novel feels quite important since battle between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is a well-loved trope: This story adds more complexity and dynamism to this oft-explored conflict.
Nettie is another character whose motivations are explored extensively, which is a rather tricky but successfully-addressed conundrum considering that she is an immensely private person. Her character arc exemplifies the work’s ability to sustain the mystery, while also divulging just the right amount of information across the chapters. It is this technique in particular which keeps up Hepworth’s story since it does not have any of the drive of a traditional whodunnit.
Overall, “The Mother-in-Law” doesn’t bring anything new to the table. So, while it might not make the top of any beach reads list, there is something rather unrelenting about its characters and their strange but oddly satisfying dynamics, which ultimately makes it worth the read. With their quick fire exchanges, the protagonists will certainly demand the reader’s attention.

Cambridge Square Capital LP, a hedge fund with extensive ties to Harvard, is closing its doors after just two years in existence.
The fund announced its decision to “terminate the business of the funds and wind up its affairs” in an April letter to investors, but did not specify the precise reason the fund is closing, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.
Harvard Management Company was heavily invested in the hedge fund. In fiscal year 2017, the University’s tax filings listed $256.6 million in assets in a Cayman Islands-based subsidiary that lists its headquarters as Cambridge Square Capital’s Boston office. Harvard’s assets in the fund declined by $11.5 million over the course of the fiscal year. The Cayman Islands-based subsidiary, the Cambridge Square Institutional Fund, was fully owned by Harvard.
Between its various entities, Cambridge Square Capital had more than $500 million under management in March 2018, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Its founder, Marco Barrozo, worked at HMC for eight years, from 2007 to 2015. During his time at HMC, Barrozo worked as a managing director and was among the company’s highest-paid employees. He brought home $4.8 million in fiscal year 2013 and again in 2015, according to University tax filings.
Several of Barrozo’s partners at Cambridge Square Capital — including most of the fund’s top brass — were also former HMC employees. Apoo Koticha, an executive at the fund, was a portfolio manager at HMC from 2007 to 2014. Director of Operations Thomas Angelillo also spent nine years at HMC.
The fund had an after-fee loss of 2.5 percent in 2017 and a gain of 2 percent last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.
In recent years, under the leadership of new CEO N.P. Narvekar, HMC has shifted many of its formerly internally managed holdings to external funds, often founded by former HMC employees. In January 2017, Narvekar laid off more than 100 of its roughly 230 employees.
“We can no longer justify the organizational complexity and resources necessary to support the investing activities of these portfolios,” he wrote in a letter at the time.
Since then, HMC has invested hundreds of millions in funds started by its former external managers, and its 22-person real estate team moved to Bain Capital. Cambridge Square Capital is not among this group, having been formed well before the 2017 layoffs. HMC has stayed quiet about the exact number of employees who remain after the layoffs.

Just over a week before Harvard’s own Commencement exercises take place in the Yard, Yale University granted Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow an honorary Doctor of Social Science degree Monday.
Yale University President Peter Salovey awarded Bacow and ten other recipients with honorary degrees at its commencement ceremony Monday.
Bacow is not the first Harvard President to receive an honorary degree from Yale — it is a long-standing tradition for the two institutions’ presidents to bestow upon each other these degrees shortly after they assume their role. Former University President Drew G. Faust received a Doctor of Humanities degree in 2008, Lawrence H. Summers accepted an honorary Doctor of Social Science degree in 2002, and Derek C. Bok received a Doctor of Laws degree in 1971.
Harvard awarded Salovey an honorary degree in 2015.
Bacow alluded to the tradition in a statement Monday.
“I recognize that the honorary degree I received from Yale today was far more an honor bestowed upon Harvard than it was upon me personally,” Bacow said. “Our two institutions have much in common beyond a friendly rivalry.”
“We are each committed to the search for truth, scholarly excellence, and a commitment to expanding opportunity for all. I truly enjoyed being part of the Yale commencement festivities," he added.
Among Monday’s honorary recipients are former Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury James A. Baker III, women’s rights activist Gloria Steinem, and award-winning novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, who spoke last year at Harvard College’s Class Day exercises.
Adichie also spoke this year at the Yale College Class Day exercises. Harvard invited Al Gore ’69 to address undergraduates at this year’s College Class Day, which will take place on May 29. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will serve as the Commencement speaker for all Harvard class of 2019 graduates on May 30.
Past honorary degree recipients at Harvard have included Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep, Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg ’06, and Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison.
The Yale Corporation has awarded honorary degrees since 1702 and they are the highest honors the university awards.

The Cambridge City Council voted at its meeting Monday to adopt a budget for fiscal year 2020 that represents the largest spending increase in city history.
The budget — which passed despite concerns and objections from several councilors — totals more than $678 million in appropriations and marks a 5.7 percent increase from fiscal year 2019. The appropriations include more than $200 million earmarked for education, up from $191 million in 2019, and $146 million for public safety, compared to $139 million the previous year.
The budget proposal passed by a vote of 7-2, with councilors Craig A. Kelley and Quinton Y. Zondervan voting against it.
During the discussion period, several councilors said they harbored concerns about the budget’s proposals for education, arts, and transportation funding.
Kelley called both the school budget and lack of funding for new modes of transportation “disappointments.”
“We have vast resources that we are leaving on the table,” he said. “I can’t support a budget that continues to do that.”
Some council members, including Zondervan, E. Denise Simmons, Alanna M. Mallon, and Dennis J. Carlone said they think the Council needs to implement further support for artistic spaces in Cambridge. They all specifically cited the Multicultural Arts Center in East Cambridge.
Though she voted in favor, Mallon said the funding discussions left her with “more questions than answers.”
Simmons likewise voted for the plan but said she had reservations about some elements of the proposal. She said she thinks the school budget does not adequately support African American men, and argued that Cambridge’s school system has “chronically been failing.”
“There are good things, but I am in no way satisfied of what the school department has done, and I hope they hear that loud and clear so that whoever chairs the School Committee and the next term will take that with them and say, ‘You're going to have trouble with the City Council,’” she said. “I'm voting favorably for the budget in protest of the school department's budget, and will continue to do so until such time we have closed the gap significantly for African American men.”
Cambridge Mayor Mark C. McGovern, who chairs the School Committee, took issue with the criticism.
“Although I completely respect anyone's feelings of what they feel they can support or not, I just feel like having been part of constructing this budget, I disagree that this is business as usual," he said. "I think this is this is a budget that has was pulled together in a very different way and directs resources in a very different way.”
City Manager Louis A. DePasquale responded to criticisms about the school budget by saying he can “appreciate the conversation,” but argued the budget represents the best possible plan given the challenges his office faced, including a rising school budget and an increase in paid positions.
“I take my bottom line authority very seriously,” he said. “But want to bring home that this has been a city committed to funding education I feel is second to none.”
Before the Council voted, Simmons said the City Manager’s explanation of the school budget still did not satisfy her.
“Call it what it is, and then fix it,” she said. “Because if we're not willing to be brave and courageous, then we're going to continue to have hundreds of children sentenced to a life of despair and travesty because we could not call it out and then take care of it.”
