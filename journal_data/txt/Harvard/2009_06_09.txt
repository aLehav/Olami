After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former New York Times reporter, a cardiologist, and the head of a Smithsonian museum are among the six newly elected members of the Board of Overseers, Harvard’s second-highest governing board.
Lawyer Morgan Chu, cardiologist Walter Clair ’77, former New York Times reporter Linda J. Greenhouse ’68, New York City Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Photeine M. Anagnostopoulos ’81, and the Smithsonian’s Director of the Museum of Natural History Cristián Samper won six-year terms in an alumni vote to serve on the 30-member board.Former CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Joshua S. Boger, who received the sixth most votes, will serve the remaining three-year term vacated by Arne S. Duncan ’86, who left to serve as U.S. Secretary of Education.
Those six beat out four other candidates, two of whom were nominated by petition. Professor Margaret Levi, a professor of international studies at the University of Washington, and Mark D. Gearan ’78, the president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges, were nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association, and lawyers Robert L. Freedman ’62 and Harvey A. Silverglate ’67—who informally ran together—were nominated by petition.
The successful candidates said that they were thrilled to be elected, but also expressed a degree of humility about the scope of their new roles.
“I view as the Board both historically and into the future as being more of a best friend, a best pal, than an overseer if it is someone who is higher than others,” said Morgan Chu, who found out that he had won during Commencement, where his brother, U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, delivered the keynote address.
But the petition candidates argued that the Board of Overseers should play a more assertive role.
“I believe the role of the Overseer is to oversee,” Silverglate said, adding that he sees it as a “deadly” trend that organizations—both non-profits and for-profit corporations—are increasingly “being run by their administrators rather than by their boards.”
Silverglate stressed the importance of reforming Harvard College’s Administrative Board, which he called “the worst” disciplinary body in the country. Freedman, who is more focused on the curriculum, argued that Harvard should implement an optional great books program in spite of the financial crisis.
“To me, the curriculum doesn’t teach the important stuff. In fact, to me, there’s no curriculum,” Freedman said. “I think [students] need grounding in the basics, and I don’t think they get it anymore.”
Silverglate finished in eighth place, and Freedman finished last.
Although Silverglate and Freedman argued that the Board of Overseers has been acting too much like a rubber stamp, the Board will have at least one new member with experience asking probing questions.
There was one silver lining for Linda Greenhouse in her decision to take a buyout from the New York Times last year.
The Harvard Alumni Association had approached her a few years ago to ask if she was interested in running. But when she asked for permission from then-executive editor Joseph Lelyveld ’58, he said it would be a conflict of interest for her to take part in confidential discussions while being obligated to report to the Times, which covers Harvard.
Greenhouse said that one of the first things she did after taking the buyout last year was approach the Harvard Alumni Association and some of her friends on the Board of Overseers to see if they could “get the ball rolling” again.
The Board of Overseers, which meets five times a year to discuss University matters, reports to the Harvard Corporation, the University’s chief governing body. The Overseers are responsible for ratifying some of the Corporation’s major decisions, such as the selection of new University Presidents.

In fact, Anagnostopoulos is the chief operating officer of New York City's public schools, not their superintendent.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SACRAMENTO, Calif.—After 106 years, the time was ripe for a change. For the first time ever in its long and storied history, the 2009 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championships was moved from its usual east coast location to Sacramento, Calif., where the nation’s top crews duked it out from Thursday through Saturday. The 2000-meter Lake Natoma course played host to five men’s heavyweight events (a reduction from previous years) as well as a men’s and women’s lightweight competition. Also making its first appearance in this year’s iteration of the regatta was a new selection standard, which required boats to now qualify for entry while prohibiting club teams from participating.Despite the change, the field remained loaded with contenders. "The strongest field across the board I've seen, at least in the years we've been going to the IRAs," Harvard coach Harry Parker called it.Pacific-10 conference rivals Cal, Stanford, and Washington represented the heavyweight favorites, but defending champion Wisconsin was not to be forgotten either. And of course, the Ancient Eight, led by Harvard and Brown, intended to make its presence felt.The only team to enter all of the regatta’s events, the Crimson’s best showing came in the freshmen division, where its rookies proved undeterred by their cross-country trek, winning a silver medal to give the team its only top-three finish.“A heroic effort, a really unified effort,” freshman coach Bill Manning said. “Probably the best batch of 19-year-olds on the water today.”Heavily-favored Washington, featuring not only an Olympian but also members of the German and Canadian under-23 teams, jumped out to an early lead in the freshman eight grand final and never looked back. Thus the bulk of the drama involved the fight for the second place, as the field remained even for the first 300 meters. The Crimson got off to an unfavorable start, finding itself in dead last after 500 meters, but it then began to challenge for a medal.“Looked like they got off to an atrocious start…it looked terrible,” Manning said.With 750 meters remaining, Cornell and Harvard were gaining ground on second-place Brown, and a frantic sprint to the finish allowed the Crimson to pass the Bears and come out ahead by less than four tenths of a second. The comeback came two days after the boat took first place over Cal in its heat, which gave it an automatic berth in the final.But in the regatta’s marquee event, the Harvard varsity eight came up a little short. The Crimson was never truly in contention for first, which for most of the race was occupied by either the top-seeded Golden Bears or the Cardinals. Surging from the rest of the pack late in the contest, Washington caught Cal with about 250 meters left and pulled ahead in the final 100 meters to win by nine tenths of a second. “They’re really strong people, people who have raced at senior world championships…even Olympians,” Crimson stroke Simon Gawlik said of the caliber of rowers at the regatta. “That’s a level of athlete that Harvard right now, at least, doesn’t have.”Harvard’s fifth place finish, nearly eleven seconds behind the leader, was especially disheartening considering that the Brown boat was three ticks faster. Harvard had beaten its Ivy rival in its first heat by over two seconds, a satisfying reversal of last month’s Eastern Sprints. But the Bears found a little extra on Saturday and did the best out of the crews hailing from east of the Mississippi.“The varsity was a little disappointed,” Parker said. “They probably were just a little bit more tired from the hard racing on Thursday and Friday than they realized. They didn’t quite have enough left. They raced extremely well on Thursday and Friday, and it caught up to them.”Nonetheless, the performance was a vast improvement upon last year’s failure to even make the IRA grand final.Washington’s victory in the most prestigious race of the day capped a marvelous performance by the Husky rowers, who also took the second varsity eight grand final. While Brown and BU made strong showings for their coast, the fifth-place Crimson exhibited competitive spirit in the face of adversity. The night before the grand final, captain Teddy Schreck was struck with an apparent bout of dehydration and remained in the team hotel on Saturday.“I was particularly impressed with the aggressiveness of their race after having to make the last-minute change,” Parker said. “They raced really well, I thought. I was very proud of them.”Schreck’s replacement, rising junior Phil Matthews, was pulled up from Harvard’s entries in the four-man events.The Crimson finished fifth in the grand final of the varsity fours, which was won by a Cal crew that had to fight off a late charge by Washington. The open four, an event requiring at least one freshman and one upperclassman among the oarsmen in the crew, saw Harvard finish second in the petite final behind Cornell and eighth overall, following lackluster fifth and third-place finishes in the first heat and repéchage, respectively.Although classes are long gone and commencement has passed too, the Crimson heavyweights are still hard at work. Its final race of a long season will be this Saturday, as Harvard takes on Yale in the 144th Harvard-Yale Regatta in New London, Conn.The Crimson lightweights took bronze in the seven-boat final, the lone men’s lightweight race, finishing behind Princeton and Yale. As expected, the undefeated Tigers dominated, winning by almost five seconds. The Bulldogs, on the other hand, narrowly emerged victorious in the fight for second, a late comeback Harvard was none too happy about, since Yale had placed fifth at Eastern Sprints.“[The Crimson] performed very well…fact is, they gave their best and it didn’t happen for them today,” lightweight coach Charley Butt said. “We knew that [Yale] was going to be a lot faster. For their standard they’ve been off this year, but to see them put it together was not a surprise.”“It’s a big turnaround from last year, and we’re maybe a little disappointed to be in third place today, but we’re still going home with a medal,” captain Jeff Overington added.
