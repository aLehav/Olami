If  caressing the audience is a vital part of a production, an ideal space  to put up the play is the OBERON. A production that relies on mood  whiplash—drastic 180-degree shifts in tone—to effect the feeling of  losing one’s memory could use the space well. And a play that needs to  put something on a pedestal could definitely make use of the air  straight above the drink-clutching audience members, as well as using  tables, balconies, and staircases to give characters brief spotlights.  Thankfully, “Lunar Labyrinth,” which played for one night on February  13, uses the space’s advantages to its ultimate potential. Based on a  short story by Neil Gaiman, the production’s superb use of sound and  space ended up transforming the original short story from its  urban-legend Americana into a play that does its best when imagining the  grand, epic mythologies of what attracted that wanderer to climb up to  the Labyrinth in the first place.
 
Plot-wise,  the wanderer (Phil Berman) takes a respite from walking the Earth to  visit a local attraction called the Lunar Labyrinth, which is rumored to  cure illness if correctly navigated under the full moon’s light. The  script adaptation of Gaiman’s story patches together different local  legends—woman who gives birth to a monster, children and couples drawn  to the moon, the requisite coyotes—all whimsically told by a hobbling,  eccentric guide (John J. King). With classic Gaiman-esque comedy that  suggests cliché only to revile it, King says, “You’ll see how it lies  when we get to the top of the hill”—“How does it lie?”—“At the top of  the hill.”
 
While  the short story—printed out and dimly lit for the audience’s enjoyment  outside of the main room—had more of a dusky, “Twilight Zone” mood and  focused on building suspense between guide and wanderer, the play  doesn’t buy into the same strategy. Rather than building up anecdotes to  culminate in spine-chilling fear, the best scenes of “Lunar Labyrinth”  are those with the emphasis placed on the epic, with wanderer and guide  changing from amused conversationalists to classical guide and wanderer  tropes backed up by a Greek chorus of supporting actors. A surprisingly  serious version of “Lux Aeterna” scores the most memorable of the  scenes, and the decision to cast the lunar protagonist (Eileen Little)  as an aerialist who can sashay her way up silks to the ceiling goes a  long way in effecting the crippling fascination with the moon most of  the characters share. The less successful scenes are the fear-based  ones, like a particularly gruesome birth scene reminiscent of the  alien-from-human-womb scene in last year’s film “Prometheus,” a  confusing choice that might have been a bit too heavy-handed. In fact,  the fear present in Gaiman’s story is often mocked with segues in the  tone of old monster flick “It’s Alive!” moments, and a weird replay of  the birth scene with the mother singing as in a jazz cabaret.
 
At  the play and story’s end, the protagonist is left alone at the maze’s  entrance. Granted, given the comical treatment of fear preceding this  climax, it would have been more appropriate for him to hear Admiral  Ackbar’s famous proclamation, “It’s a trap,” rather than the  disembodied, growling “Run” he hears. However, the final moments of the  play come with a big reveal for the audience milling around with  cocktail in hand; alcohol is necessary for the audience to feel less  uncomfortable as actors in powdered face and ripped white clothing  fondle them. Even though the adaptation from story to performance chose  to develop the pure epic and mythological moments rather than the dark,  more dust-swept Americana folklore at which Gaiman excels, it was  ultimately nicest to see an “aha” moment that was so unexpected—we’re  talking on the level of Low-Key Lyesmith’s reveal in “American Gods.”  The unpredictable ending tied the whole production together; it is  apparent that “Lunar Labyrinth” shot for the moon and landed among the  stars.

“My  spirits hang as heavy as the testicles on an old horse” is not a line  we might attribute to Shakespeare. Yet this striking line is exactly the  sort of dialogue that playwright Robert Brustein has imagined for an  aging Bard, whom he depicts in his latest play, “The Last Will.” Suffolk  University and Commonwealth Shakespeare Company debuted the play on  Wednesday at the Modern Theatre, where it will play until Feb. 24. 
It  takes a certain sort of writerly confidence for a playwright to put  words in the mouth of Shakespeare, but Brustein, who is the  distinguished scholar in residence at Suffolk, has done it twice before;  “The Last Will” is the final installment in a trilogy that depicts  Shakespeare in different stages of his life. 
Dark,  self-aware, and ultimately sanguine, “The Last Will” presents a more  complicated portrait of the man behind the name. Shakespeare (Allyn  Burrows) returns to his wife of over two decades, Anne Hathaway (Brooke  Adams), on the heels of a great loss: the famous Globe Theatre, where  his works were staged, has just burned down. With rapidly faltering  health and lucidity, the writer intends to make amends.
No  one is above reproach in Brustein’s depiction of Stratford-upon-Avon;  Shakespeare’s daughters (Stacy Fischer and Merritt Janson) squabble for  his affection and inheritance like the characters Goneril and Regan in  “King Lear.” Fearing unfaithfulness, Shakespeare makes plans to change  his last will in order to disinherit his wife. Indeed, the play is rife  with riffs on the word “will”; it is used first as the main character’s  name, then to mean a legal document and as a term describing his burning  writerly passion. “I’ve lost the will to write,” Will laments. The  world’s most famous playwright is here shown taken down to a humble size  by self-doubt, writer’s block, paranoia, and perhaps syphilis;  Brustein’s Shakespeare is not your AP English class’s portrait of the  writer.
Brustein  and director Steven Maler naturally weave comparisons between  Shakespeare’s family and the characters he created in his many plays. As  Shakespeare hurtles towards the final stages of a fatal illness, he  begins to conflate characters from his plays with the real people in his  life. “I feel you mock me, Gertrude,” he says to his wife, confusing  her with Hamlet’s mother. 
Shakespeare’s  works are not only alluded to; they are directly quoted in the  performance, often by characters who mock Will by throwing his own  well-known lines back at him. Upon being accused of adultery by her  truant husband, Anne tosses back a reconstruction of the classic Hamlet  line “frailty thy name is woman”: “Appetite thy name is man,” she  challenges. The language is modern but formal, starched. 
Much  of the success of the play comes from the mature and carefully  controlled acting of Adams and Burrows. Adams, as Anne, provides the  sass and wit that challenges Shakespeare’s 17th-century representation  of frail and unfaithful women. Brustein’s Anne is a sassy verbal  sparring partner for Shakespeare’s rough patriarch.
The  stark, minimalist set design by Eric Levenson—consisting principally of  a couple of curtains and some beer stains and pub accessories—is in  direct contrast with costume designer Nancy Leary’s ornate,  Elizabethan-era clothing. The theater at Suffolk University is notably  small in scale and intimate in design, with audience members within  arm’s reach of the cast. The combined effect is one of making a great  man more human-sized.
Yet  for all its attempts to present Shakespeare the man over Shakespeare  the myth, the play does not stray far from a wide-eyed admiration of  him—in repeating  his more famous lines, other characters remind the  audience of the long-lasting success of Will’s plays. Modern viewers  also might take issue with the historical accuracy of the play’s  depictions or the unrealistic enthusiasm Shakespeare has for fixing his  family.
While  works of art surrounding Shakespeare can at times stand on their own as  pieces of art, “The Last Will” suggests that they remain testaments to  the creative powers of a literary great. In the final line of the show,  Brustein writes, “His legacy he bequeathed to us all…whose benefactors  are as numerous as the stars.” It seems that at least in the realm of  theater, the works of Shakespeare are a gift that keeps giving.

Since the era of Classical composer Joseph Haydn, the string quartet has been one of the most prominent arrangements for chamber music. On March 2 in Paine Hall, an extensive collaboration of musicians will juxtapose traditional instrumentation with new, modern pieces, played by the JACK String Quartet. The concert will premiere works composed by members of the Harvard Group for New Music, made up of 16 graduate students in Harvard’s department of Music with diverse musical specializations including composition, theory, musicology, and ethnomusicology.
To Timothy McCormack, one of the group’s members, the deep-rooted tradition of the string quartet makes the upcoming performance all the more exciting. “We all write interesting music…from [the Classical] tradition, but it’s not going to sound like a Beethoven quartet,” he says. Instead, the pieces will feature each composer’s unique approach to the music and the ensemble. Marta Gentilucci, an Italian composer and vocalist who will also have a piece premiered at the event, looks forward to the variety of talents that will be showcased. “Each of us have our own compositional world,” she says.
The JACK String Quartet, which primarily concentrates on the performance of new works, is made up of  John P. Richards, Ari Streisfeld, Christopher Otto, and Kevin McFarland.  Although some of the composers, including Gentilucci, have not had a chance to work with the JACK Quartet directly, the composers are enthusiastic about the caliber of the upcoming performance. “We are very lucky to have high-level professionals coming to play our pieces,” Gentilucci says. “We have a chance to really work in a professional situation.”
McCormack, who has worked with the Quartet before, is equally excited to hear them premiere his works. “You get a sense onstage at their performances…that they’re good friends and they became an ensemble because they wanted to play together. It changes the music.”

Some  groups of friends live together, breathe together, and succeed  together. But what happens when only one succeeds? This was the subject  explored in “pool (no water)” which played in Adams Pool Theater last  weekend. Written by British playwright Mark Ravenhill, the play centers  on a group of four artists and their former partner—referred to by the  other characters as “She”—who breaks away and finds success. The drama  begins in a hospital with the four friends taking care of the injured  but never-present fifth member of the group. Soon “She” becomes a  perversion of an art project as the four artists, consumed by jealousy  and resentment, exploit her condition for their own benefits.  Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “pool (no water)” is for  the most part thought-provoking and unsettling in its display of  uncensored emotion, although at times it stumbles in the face of its own  grandiosity.
Written  as one long monologue and divided up into individual lines by the  actors, the play’s life is very much dependent on the choices of  director Joshua R. McTaggart ’13, a Crimson arts editor. His clever use  of space and props bring an extra dimension to the production by toying  with and parodying the idea of self-reflective art. The audience sits on  the stage while the actors perform above them in the rows of seats.  What has become the stage is sparse, with only a black tarp, window, and  a film projector. This minimalist attitude and inversion of a  traditional stage setup makes it very apparent that the characters in  the play, who are never named, are very conscious that they are creating  a work of art, twisted and self-indulgent. It is art within art, and  the result is both frustrating and satisfying.
Yet,  at times, the production’s quest for that extra dimension comes off  heavy-handed and overwrought, which contrasts with the otherwise subtle  nature of McTaggart’s directorial choices. The characters film  themselves throughout the play as if making a pseudo-documentary, with  their images shown on the projection above. The use of the camera is  successful most of the time and contributes to the concept of art within  art. However, occasionally the camera use is overdone; it came up too  often in moments when the characters were trying to convey emotions, or  without any apparent pattern. Many times, though, McTaggart gets it  right, to wondrous results—there is one scene in which the actors used  the microphone wire as an IV when manipulating their friend’s body to  take an unattractive photo. Because this fifth friend is never played by  any actor and instead fleshed out by the words of the other four,  scenes like these help define the relationships between the five. The  result is startling, and it’s thanks to these smaller, unexpected  choices that the more self-conscious artistic choices, like the camera,  are balanced out.
The  actors are given the challenging task of bringing the play to life  through the movement and rhythm of their speech, and they achieve this  with varying degrees of success. The ensemble, consisting of Alistair A.  Debling ’16, Anna A. Hagen ’15, John L. Pizzato ’16, and Sara K.  Rosenburg ’16, is able to develop and retain the feeling of  self-loathing and franticness that bubbles under the surface of their  characters. The rhythm of their words is particularly powerful when the  group attempts to destroy the friend’s next art project by deleting  photos while chanting “select and delete” at a crescendo. The actors  display an emotional vulnerability through the beat of their words and  frustration with their predicament.
There  is a sense that there are no distinctive characters in “pool (no  water),” but rather fragments and pieces of one; it is up to each actor  to decide how to parse the script so that individual characters emerge  from the undifferentiated body of the text. The actors’ movement,  however, feels too unwieldy and heavy at times, breaking the illusion  that the actors move as one. They do not retain the same smooth, clean  lines, and therefore the cohesion of the group is shattered by the  disjointed physicality. There are scenes that call for a seamless  connection of their bodies to express the codependency of its actors.  Sometimes their movements fall flat, the tension and awkwardness  evident. Separately, though, the actors put on a fine show, moving their  bodies with a tightness that is appropriate for their characters.
The  fantastic script of “pool (no water)” brings the show together; it is  witty and darkly introspective in a way that can hide some of the minor  deficiencies of the production. Despite some of the faults, the  production is a worthy, if ambitious, performance thanks to its director  and the passionate actors. There are real moments of unrelenting  emotion that surprises the audience with its ferocity, though there are  occasional bouts of inconsistency.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In 1999, Antwerp was transformed into a series of laboratories and galleries. Throughout the Belgian city, scientists opened their doors to members of the public who were curious to see what they were working on. At the same time, Antwerp’s artists were also welcoming people into their studios and displaying numerous works of art. The citywide exhibition, entitled “Laboratorium,” curated by Barbara Vanderlinden and Hans-Ulrich Obrist, and including Harvard physics professor Peter L. Galison among its artists, was intended to probe the ways art and science are interrelated by inviting the citizens of Antwerp to experience the interfaces between the two disciplines.
Despite the historically strong ties between the arts and the sciences—from Leonardo da Vinci, with his painstakingly rendered anatomical investigations to Albert Einstein, who was a gifted violinist—such projects are the exception and not the rule. Today, the two disciplines are conceived of as not only separate but diametrically opposed to each other. Such a caricature, which portrays science as essential but uncreative and art as humanistic but ultimately impractical, is overly simplistic and does not do justice to either discipline.
The divide is present at Harvard as well, perhaps nowhere more obvious than in the geography of the University: science and engineering labs sprawl north of Annenberg, while the Barker Center and most of Harvard’s art museums huddle together on a narrow strip of land between Quincy Street and Prescott Street. The first question after the obligatory name-dorm-hometown exchange a freshman is likely to be asked is, “Are you a science person or a humanities person?” It’s a loaded question, one that presumes that it is impossible to be both. And for people whose interests really do straddle the divide between the two, students and professors suggest, such a culture can puts pressure on individuals to focus on one side of their interests and shelve the others.
But here, as in Antwerp, academic innovators are pushing back against this either-or culture. A multiplying list of interdisciplinary courses questions the notion that science and art are irreconcilably separated. By creating classes that meld the two together, professors are challenging students to think critically about culture’s perceptions, blurring the boundaries and in some cases rejecting them altogether.
 
CONCEPTUAL ART
Among those bridging the gap are students who do not merely take an interdisciplinary elective, but who choose to concentrate in two “opposite” fields. Awais Hussain ’15 is such a student: a joint physics-philosophy concentrator, he says the two complement each other more than people might assume. “Philosophers actually love analyzing math and trying to figure out why math [has] this weird kind of position in terms of knowledge. One plus one is always two, no matter where you are on the planet, no matter where you are in the universe,” Hussain says. “Why is it so special in that sense?”
“[Philosopher] Bertrand Russell is a prime example of that – he basically redefined logic but he was an amazing mathematician,” Hussain adds. “I think it makes sense because in both subjects you have to think very clearly, very specifically, and focus very much on the small details that most people would arguably miss.”
Even the app Hussain is currently trying to launch comes with some philosophical aspects. The program, an intuitive calendar that allows you to log everything you do, is designed to make people more aware of time and break out of bad habits like procrastination. In Hussain’s opinion, people should acknowledge that time and money are both quantifiable assets that can be spent, wasted, and lost.
Like Hussain, Aisha K. Down ’14, a joint Physics-English concentrator and inactive Crimson editor, also sees a natural link between her two fields. “Physics and English: they’re a way of using language in order to get at truths which are much more underlying,” she says. Even though she’s hoping to write a fiction thesis, Down feels sure that her background in physics will have an enormous impact on her work. “Physics has made me a much better writer,” she says. “In a way, writing a story is more like solving a problem than other aspects of English because you have to make things logically follow, you have to create your own causality, and you have to sell it.”
Down expressed a great deal of frustration at the stereotypes and rivalry that persist between departments. “I don’t think that the end goal [of physics and English]—or the thing that drives them, which is a quest for a kind of truth—is different. I don’t think one has to be less rigorous or more creative or more practical than the other,” she says. “I think a lot of good thinking is killed off by attitudes that different departments have towards each other.”
ARTISTIC AWARENESS
Physics professor Peter S. Pershan is one member of the Harvard community attempting to present a picture of art and science unified. His freshman seminar, “You and Your Camera,” examines the science of photography, with topics ranging from quantum mechanics to how the eye works. The course also delves into photography’s history and asks students to try their hand at the art.
While he spends much of his time working with physics at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Pershan has always had an interest in photography. “It’s been a hobby of mine for many years,” he says. “I would describe myself as an old child, and I think most of my colleagues, especially in sciences, are. What do you do when you’re five years old? You play with toys, and that’s how you learn. I love playing, and photography is just part of that.”
Pershan affirmed that his knowledge of physics strongly influences his own photography: for example, his knowledge of the eye’s perception of color might play a role in his selection of a photographic subject. Yet despite his personal enthusiasm, Pershan acknowledges that many photographers never found it necessary to understand optics in order to be great artists. “It’s a very personal thing. People often learn things empirically and use them without ever understanding why [they are effective]. Other people like to know why,” he says. “And who moves ahead faster in accomplishing more? That’s very hard to say.”
For Pershan, his passions for physics and photography are two different manifestations of the same concept: an eternal sense of wonder at the marvels of nature. “Art and science go together,” he says, “I think any scientist who hasn’t thought about the fact that science is beautiful—well, I think they all do. Part of the motivation of string theory is the beauty of the way mathematics can explain nature, the beauty of how our bodies work. And so I’m in awe of this thing every day of my life.”
Others, such as professor of systems science Peter A. Cariani, look at how science can help illuminate what it is that draws people to art in the first place. Much of Cariani’s work involves the psychology of why people listen to music, and it is this topic that he addresses in his class “Music, Mind, and Brain.”
“We use [music] to change our emotional states.... for mood control, for distraction, for cognitive interest, for inducing spiritual states, for reinforcing personal identity,” Cariani says. Because music has so many uses, it has been difficult to pin down the exact evolutionary reason for what Steven Pinker once termed “auditory cheesecake,” or designed to stimulate several areas of the brain. Still, says Cariani, there are some things that we do know, such as that certain dopamine circuits are activated by pleasant music, and that circuits related to unpleasant stimuli are activated by music disliked by the listener.
Cariani agrees with Pershan that artists don’t need to understand the science behind their work in order to be successful. In his view, the purposes of art and science are fundamentally different—art affects, while science explains. However, he adds that several past students of his who were studying musical composition at the New England Conservatory had found the psychological background helpful to them in their work. “The more one knows about one’s art and how it works, the more conscious one can be. It can be useful for artists to understand because it makes them more aware.”
DOUBLE EXPRESSION
 
Engineering Science 20: "How to Create Things and Have Them Matter” promises a lot in its course title. Taught by biomedical engineering professor David A. Edwards and International Director of Education for the ArtScience prize Andrea R. Sachdeva, the class attempts to introduce students to scientific concepts that then serve as jumping-off points for projects in fields ranging from design to humanitarianism. Students who wish to pursue their projects further have the opportunity to continue their work over the summer in Paris or Cape Town. Ideas that have come out of the class include Le Whif, a breathable chocolate spray now available in 20,000 stores, and the Pumpkin, an eco-friendly device for carrying water that was modeled after biological cells.
“At the time [I began teaching this course] there was a lot of effort to get different groups around the university to interact and to work together, and I noticed that in those complex group meetings there were medical doctors and physicists and engineers,” Edwards says. “But there were no musicians, there were no faculty from VES and so forth, and so that led to a conversation.” His goal in developing the course was to create an environment of true collaboration among students of various fields. “Today, if you’re the math student, you’re among the math students, and if you’re the literature student, you’re among the literature students,” he says. “The environment you’re given is encouraging a certain way of thinking, but typically not an integrative way of thinking. It’s hard to achieve that in a specialized environment.” This semester, the course includes students from a wide variety of concentrations—literature, history of art and architecture, history of science, and molecular and cellular biology, to name just a few.
According to Sachdeva, many of the students choose the class as a way to express a side of themselves that their usual academic track does not allow them to. “Most of them have an official major, and that’s their title and what they do, but they have all these secret skills that they just don’t have the chance to exercise normally,” she says. “We have someone who’s a bio major but also a ballet dancer.”
Edwards adds, “We always get a certain subset of people who have that dual interest and focus, but typically—and it was totally true of me—have never seen the advantage of having that dual interest. But to discover that that’s a richness and an opportunity is the new thing going on here.” 
Edwards has also noted an increasing willingness on the part of the faculty to experiment with interdisciplinary methods. “When I made the flip from being this applied math guy to suddenly art, there was quite a reaction from a lot of faculty members here who went, ‘There’s no calculus in the class? Then how can this really be real?’ But there’s been a real evolution.”
“AN INTELLECTUAL BUFFET”
Hugo Van Vuuren ’07 was one of the students who took ES 20 in its early days. His class was tasked with lighting London in preparation for the Olympics. But his team, composed mostly of African students, decided to take things in a different direction. Together, they launched Lebone, a project aimed at creating a battery powered entirely by dirt for use in developing countries. The project, which is still going, won grants from both the World Bank and the Gates Foundation.
Edwards’s class has had a lasting impact on Van Vuuren’s professional trajectory, he says. “I took the course before secondary fields, and so David’s class was just an awesome buffet, an intellectual buffet of projects that you work[ed] on in the course with other students [using] either a scientific method or an artistic method.” In the time since he graduated, Van Vuuren says, he has seen Harvard increasingly embrace interdisciplinary courses, a change he partially attributes to Edwards’s charisma and unflagging efforts.
Van Vuuren is currently a partner at the Experiment Fund (also called the Xfund), Harvard’s first dedicated seed fund. The project backs four to six startups a year, ranging from health incubators to Tivli. Several of the projects currently being considered for funding came out of ES 20, and the Xfund has also given grants to the course’s students in the past to help them continue their research abroad. But though Van Vuuren is in the business of funding startups, he appreciates the fact that ES 20’s goal is not only to churn out company ideas. “There are courses that focus explicitly on building profitable companies, and obviously that’s great for the Xfund, but from David’s perspective, that is also restricting because not all ideas are profitable,” Van Vuuren says. “Not all things that society needs—the creative arts and other cultural entrepreneurship activities—are immediately rewarded by the market.”
Van Vuuren welcomes the increasing number of students who want to explore not just one interest but several. “The question is how to strike the balance between what you call a pan-disciplinary education whilst making sure, as [former Harvard president Abbott] Lowell says, that every student graduates and knows a little bit about everything, but something well,” he says. “That’s a fine balance.”

The colors, music, and energy of South Asia will light up Agassiz Theater starting Feb 28 in the Harvard South Asian Association’s annual cultural variety show, Ghungroo, which is directed by Matt W. Yarri ’14, Hania S. Chima ’14 and Karen Xiao ’14.
Featuring punjabi dance styles and dances from across India, the production is student run and features dances, musical acts, and comedy acts performed only by students.
With over 300 dancers, musicians, and artists, Ghungroo is the largest student-run production on campus and is in its 24th production “[This] will be the biggest Ghungroo in history,” co-director Matt Yarri ‘14 says.Ghungroo, the name of the event, comes from an Urdu word for an ankle bracelet worn in traditional Indian dance. Increasing recognition of and involvement about South Asian culture is an important goal of the SAA.
“Ghungroo is an awesome way to [increase awareness],” SAA treasurer Prateek Agarwal ’15 says. “By sharing South Asian culture, Ghungroo tends to bring people of all ethnicities to participate,” he says. No less than half of this year’s performers are of non-South Asian heritage, SAA members say. “We very much pride ourselves on being an open community,” Yarri says.
The production it is open to students of non-South Asian background as well as those with no experience. Yarri says that despite his background in technical production, he will be dancing in the  “Bollywood Oldies” act of the performance.Both Yarri and Agarwal are especially excited for Senior Dance, a 20-minute dance medley finale to the show that consist of over 150 performers.
“[Senior Dance is] an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of an act,” Yarri says.The Saturday night performance promises to be especially energetic, Agarwal says. With many alumni returning, including directors and dancers from previous Ghungroos, “the crowd will be rowdy,” he says.

On Feb 24, the Boston Chamber  Music Society will perform the third installment of its annual six-concert “Sanders Series.” “[The concert will showcase] three works full of youth and vigor that have withstood the test of time,” says Erica Shiller, the BCMS’s marketing and research associate.
The BCMS, a large Boston-based association of well-known and professionally acclaimed musicians, is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year. The group will be represented at Sanders Theatre by three of its members—Harumi Rhodes,  Ronald Thomas, and Mihae Lee—and guest artist Dimitri Murrath, who will be playing the lead in Mendelssohn’s Viola Sonata in C Minor. From a piece written for one musician, the concert will transition into a duet, Kodaly’s Duo for Violin and Cello, and conclude with Fauré’s Piano Quartet No. 1.
While united by their continued popularity and appeal, each piece on the program comes from a distinct moment in musical history. Mendelssohn’s sonata, in addition to being the first sonata written specifically for viola, was one of the German composer’s first compositions, which he completed at age 15. Published in 1824, the early piece helped to launch a successful composing career in the Romantic era.Leaving 19th-century Germany behind, the concert ventures into another century and nation with Kodaly’s Duo, composed in Hungary in 1914. Kodaly’s friend and fellow influential Hungarian composer Béla Bartók said of Kodaly “[H]is works are the most perfect embodiment of the Hungarian spirit.
”The last piece in the concert, Fauré’s piano quartet, is a moderate and mellow work that was composed in the middle of his career. The French composer’s career is considered innovative because of his use of clear, distinctive melodies and unresolved subtle dischord. This piano quartet is considered the most popular of his chamber works.Rhodes, the concert’s violinist, expressed her excitement about the program. “From the Kodaly Duo to the Fauré Piano Quartet, this concert will take the listener on a journey that spans the entire gamut of human emotions,” she says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Dexter Gate beseeches Harvard students to “go forth to serve thy country and thy kind.” President Faust seems to echo this plea at every Commencement, encouraging students to engage in public service through programs like her Presidential Public Service Fellowship and the Center for Public Interest Careers. But as more students consider “going forth to serve,” it’s important to think about what, exactly, it means to do public service after graduation.
It’s well known that Harvard students disproportionately go on to work in investment banking and consulting after graduation. This fact has caused consternation to everyone from New York Times blogger Catherine Rampell to Occupy Harvard to Ezra Klein. But in recent years, the Ivy-to-Wall-Street pipeline seems to have slowed: The percentage of Harvard students who reported going into consulting or investment banking after graduation has declined from 47 percent in 2007, to 39 percent in 2008, to only 22 percent in 2011, according to The Crimson’s annual senior survey. There are many possible explanations for this: Perhaps the financial sector seemed less attractive after the financial crisis of 2008; perhaps the encouragement of Harvard administrators and student activists has actually paid off.
At the same time, the percentage of students entering “public service” jobs immediately after graduation seems to have increased. For example, The Crimson reported that 11.4 percent of students who graduated last spring went into education. A survey by the Office of Career Services presents a similar trend, also suggesting that the number of students working in the nonprofit industry immediately after college rose from 4 percent in 2006 to 7 percent in 2011.
But what exactly counts as “public service?” The Phillips Brooks House Association has lauded alums such as Aaron Tanaka ‘04, who went on to work with community organizations doing advocacy work that makes real change in the lives of underserved populations, like unemployed workers in Boston. But when many Harvard students think of doing good in the world, they think of either part-time volunteer work, public policy, or Teach For America. For example, Currier House’s public service tutors tell their students they support students “whether you’re interested in working in government, nonprofit, education, politics, international development, or just want to volunteer.”
By now, most Harvard undergraduates realize that volunteering a few hours a week while working at Goldman Sachs is unlikely to benefit much other than one’s own conscience, so more students have begun searching for postgraduate jobs in “public service.” Public Interested, a Wintersession conference coordinated by Harvard’s new Assistant Dean for Public Service, Gene Corbin, featured speakers on “public interest” careers that ranged from government to socially responsible investment to community organizing.
But for those who actually want to make a difference, it’s important to think beyond simply finding a career labeled “public service” by the Office of Career Services. Jobs in nonprofit consulting, nonprofit management, corporate social responsibility, and responsible investing may feel more moral than their non-responsible counterparts, yet corporate social responsibility often simply excuses corporate excesses to the public instead of actually benefitting society. The nonprofit industrial complex has stifled true efforts to make positive change in people’s lives by taking energy and funding away from activist and advocacy organizations, so working in nonprofit management or consulting might harm more than it helps. CPIC touts summer and postgrad positions at charter schools, which have been roundly decried for corporatizing schools and harming students and teachers.  And, as Emma M.  Lind ’09, a former TFA teacher and former Crimson editorial chair, urged in her op-ed “Rethink TFA” last week, students who truly want to make positive change in the education system should think critically about engaging with a nominally do-good organization that may actually be hurting schools by replacing effective full-time teachers with inexperienced recruits.
Simply working at a policy think tank or as a politician doesn’t guarantee that you’ll actually be able to help people. Indeed, popular postgraduate pursuits like government work, nonprofit consulting, and TFA complicate the idea of “public service” for Harvard alums.
Students who want to really do good for the world might take pause at some of what passes for “public service careers” at Harvard. The Public Service portal’s calendar of events lists an information session for the Defense Intelligence Agency, which describes itself as “a Department of Defense combat support agency.” I would argue that supporting the combat operations of the Department of Defense is far from a public service. In fact, if a Harvard alum truly wanted to serve her country and her kind, she might be better off working for an advocacy organization that lobbied against funding for the Department of Defense.
If students intentionally avoid jobs on Wall Street in order to “do good for the world,” we should think hard about whether the jobs we do take will actually make sustainable, productive, and beneficial change. It would be nice if the OCS, CPIC, and Dean for Public Service put more thought into what careers they laud as “public interest.” Otherwise, well-meaning Harvard students run the risk of simply “going forth to serve” the OCS’s statistics and our own egos.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Less than seven years after the faculty voted to form the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences from the old Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences, SEAS has exhibited remarkable growth. In the past year alone, the number of undergraduate concentrators at SEAS has grown by 20 percent. Some concentrations, like computer science, have more than doubled in the past five years. At the end of the 2011 fiscal year, SEAS brought in $44.6 million for sponsored research, up nearly 21 percent from 2008.
SEAS has shown incredible potential to bring in students and sponsor research, and now it needs room to grow. SEAS Professor David A. Weitz told The Crimson earlier this month that “SEAS is crowded, there’s no space. We can’t do research, we can’t teach.” Meanwhile, Harvard has left undeveloped land and a halted construction project in Allston. The University’s plan to move SEAS across the river will give SEAS the space it needs to prosper while revitalizing Allston.
The SEAS expansion gives Harvard the opportunity to make good on its promise not to abandon Allston. Harvard’s troubled relationship with the Allston community is due in large part to the abandoned and changing plans left in the wake of the halted Allston Science Complex construction project. The new facilities that will support SEAS have the potential to breathe new life into the area. Hundreds, if not thousands, of students, faculty, and support staff will come to Allston on a daily basis, and new shops and restaurants will spring up to serve them. Harvard initiatives including the Innovation Lab and Education Portal in Allston have already created a model for long-term, mutually beneficial relationships between Harvard and the Allston community.
Yet for all the potential this move has, the University needs to resolve serious logistical issues before a single brick is laid. It would take over half an hour to walk from the Radcliffe Quad to the site of the proposed development. The shuttle from Allston to Harvard Square takes at least ten minutes. How would a student with an 11 a.m. class in Allston make it to class in the Yard by 12:07 p.m.? What happens to the professors who regularly collaborate in person, both formally and informally, with their Faculty of Arts and Sciences colleagues?
The move to Allston is an opportunity that comes with great risks. At a minimum, moving SEAS to Allston will more than double the physical span of the undergraduate campus. If Harvard can crack the problem of collaboration across distances and unifying a campus spread out across a long distance, the move will be a success. A student in an engineering class should not have to factor in extra time to go to or return from class. The true measure of success for students and faculty will be whether it is feasible, through enhanced shuttle schedules or other transportation options, to go from a class in Harvard Yard to a class in Allston in seven minutes.
These challenges cannot be taken lightly. SEAS faculty are angry that they have not been consulted on the move, and the University has taken the position that the logistical issues can be sorted out later. That position, however, neglects that the logistical issues will dictate the success or failure of this move. We are excited that SEAS will have the opportunity to grow and innovate in a new space across the river, but it will be a pyrrhic victory if SEAS becomes isolated as a result.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the past few weeks, the French government has thankfully intervened in northern Mali, where Islamist insurgents had seized control, imposed Sharia law, and destroyed countless cultural artifacts. Now, however, France has indicated that it wishes to swiftly withdraw its military forces from the country, but such a move would be ill advised. The Malian capital, Bamako, has neither the resources nor the credibility to govern the region and would be helpless to combat the ethnic tensions and Islamist insurgents that would soon resurface.
The traumatic violence that Mali has seen in recent months is largely the result of ethnic tensions that Bamako was unable to combat. Ethnically, the northern stretches of the country—called Azawad by locals—are populated by the Tuaregs, who are a Berber people completely unrelated to the Niger-Congo ethnic groups of the south. Further, these southern groups take part in an age-old tradition called “cousinage,” whereby each group is bound to the others by ancient familial ties. The Tuaregs, however, exist completely outside of this system.
Already thus alienated from the rest of the country, the Tuaregs also live a lifestyle very distinct from that of their southern neighbors. A largely nomadic people, they claim that they are often ignored by the more agricultural south. Azawad is stricken with horrendous levels of poverty, even when compared to other regions of one of the poorest countries on Earth, and Azawadis have often claimed that Bamako is callous to their plight. As such, they have called for either independence or greater representation in the Malian government ever since Mali gained its independence from France.
When Tuareg refugees streamed into Mali from Libya, bringing nationalist sentiments and heavy weaponry with them, the people of Azawad therefore embraced their calls for independence. They aligned themselves with Islamist groups such as Ansar Dine, which had broken off from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, and soon unilaterally declared independence. Once independence had been declared, however, the Islamist factions quickly moved to seize control of the region from Tuareg nationalist groups. They took city after city, imposing harsh Sharia law and destroying the shrines of Gao and Timbuktu. Within weeks, Azawad had become an Islamist shadow state where human rights were desecrated, adulterers were stoned, and women were attacked. The Malian armed forces attempted to launch a military campaign to retake the region, but they were rooted out by the Islamists and all but obliterated.
Southern Mali, meanwhile, was experiencing its own version of tumult. In March 2012, the military staged a coup, claiming that only through deposing the civilian government could they effectively pacify the country. This coup was only the first of several undemocratic changes of government, and Bamako soon lost its reputation for democracy and human rights. None of the subsequent governments was able to quell the rebellion, and Mali descended into corruption and civil strife.
When France ultimately decided to intervene in the region, it did so specifically because Bamako could not handle the situation itself. Today, Mali still lacks a competent standing army, and its government remains weak, authoritarian, and corrupt. Furthermore, both the Malian government and the Tuareg rebels are still fighting for leverage toward possible negotiations. Even though the Islamists have been driven out of Azawad, the factors that allowed them to seize control—ethnic tensions, an Islamist presence in West Africa, and an ineffective government in Bamako—remain in play. The government of Mali, itself a key component of the country’s problems, cannot be expected to ameliorate them on its own.
If there is to be any peace in the region, therefore, France must maintain a peacekeeping force in Mali. If France leaves the region as it plans to do, it will leave a power vacuum that would soon be filled by the Islamist forces remaining in West Africa, who have already begun reasserting their presence in the country. Even barring that, the tensions between Azawad and the Malian government would inevitably lead to conflict. The United Nations has indicated that it may send a peacekeeping force as an alternative, but such endeavors have a long history of failure: Somalia, Srebrenica, and Rwanda stand as testaments to that.
There are, of course, several reasons why France would be reluctant to maintain a long-term military presence in northern Mali—financial cost, risk to French soldiers, and accusations of neo-colonialism among them. In exerting its military strength to liberate the region, however, France has already intimately involved itself in the situation. Unless the French government wants its efforts to be in vain, they will have to maintain a presence in Azawad, as peacekeepers, as nation-builders, and as bulwarks against the regional specter of radical Islamism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A coalition of influential politicians, scientists, and medical researchers joined forces at a rally Monday to reaffirm the importance of medical research in the face of hundreds of millions of dollars in automatic federal sponsorship cuts which are set to take effect March 1.
Enumerating the developments and cures made possible by federal sponsorship, the leaders warned that a roughly five percent cut to all non-military programs would be devastating to Boston’s hospitals and universities—including Harvard.
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who convened the rally at Boston Medical Center, called cuts to the National Institutes of Health a “mind-boggling” blow to urgent work. The NIH is the top distributer of federal funding for medical research.
“There are sick people in this country, in this city, right now, literally fighting for their lives,” Menino said. “What keeps these patients fighting is hope. What keeps them living is science, and we can’t let Congress trample on both.”
The rally was the highest-profile effort yet to bring together the region’s top researchers to lay out their case. Speeches from Menino, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Representative Michael E. Capuano, as well as researchers from the University of Massachusetts system, Joslin Diabetes Center, BMC, and Harvard Medical School centered on the societal value of health research in creating jobs, curing disease, and preventing death.
In a short speech, Warren warned specifically of slowed innovation, fewer jobs, and rising health care costs if research wanes in the absence of federal support.
“We cannot say to our scientists fold up your work. We cannot say to young scientists, you can’t count on continuing support if you stay in the research field,” said Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor.
“It makes no sense. We can’t build a future this way,” she added.
Harvard Medical School Executive Dean of Research William W. Chin focused his remarks on the threat posed to basic research, which he said lays the groundwork for technological and medical innovation.
Basic research is the bread and butter of Harvard Medical School labs, where more than $250 million in federal grants fueled hundreds of projects during the 2012 fiscal year.
Harvard as a whole received almost $700 million in federal sponsorship for the fiscal year 2012 and could stand to lose millions of dollars earmarked for the current fiscal year and those to come if the sequester is not averted.
Chin said many researchers already worn thin after a decade without growth in funding could be driven away from their work by further cuts.
“The recent period of flat funding...has already put our scientists at risk, basic research at the fringe of knowledge at risk, and hence innovation at risk. Scientists are spending more time writing grant proposals and less in developing new ideas,” Chin said.
“A generation of scientists could be lost in a period of profound funding reduction,” he added.
Capuano, a member of the highly partisan House, said he expects Congress to reach a deal in the near future, but likely not before the March 1 deadline.
Congress already acted once to delay the sequester—a self-imposed across-the-board budget cut to reduce the federal deficit—with a short-term compromise in January.
Because Congress is in recess this week, any potential legislation to address the sequester will not be taken up for debate until next Monday.

The Cambridge City Council passed a resolution last Monday night declaring its support for the Harvard Union of Technical and Clerical Workers as the union continues its ongoing negotiations with the University.
City Council member Leland Cheung authored the resolution, which was then approved unanimously by the rest of the Council.
Current negotiations are the longest in history between the University and HUCTW, which represents over 4,600 of Harvard’s non-faculty staff. Because both sides have been unable to reach an agreement, the old contract, which expired July 1 of last year, still remains in effect.
In addition to voicing the Council’s support for HUCTW, the resolution addresses the dispute over workers’ salaries, which remains the main source of disagreement in the negotiations.
“Negotiations that ensure a consistent salary increase program and affordable health care solutions for union employees are essential for the sustenance of Cambridge’s local economy, community, and employees therein,” the Council wrote in its resolution.
In response to the City Council’s resolution and to assertions that the terms of the University’s proposed contract are not generous enough, a University spokesperson wrote in a statement that Harvard “share[s] the Council’s hope for a constructive resolution to the ongoing negotiations.”
“We are confident that our wage proposals, which have consistently been well above local inflation, are both fair and competitive,” the spokesperson wrote in a statement.
Cheung said the Council hopes the resolution will demonstrate to the union workers that the Council supports them, in addition to bringing awareness about the negotiations to the Cambridge community.
Cheung, a recent graduate of the Harvard Kennedy School, said that the HUCTW negotiations are especially important to him because he has experienced experienced firsthand the support that Harvard’s staff provides to the community.
“The issue is very personal for me, that we support the people who upported me in pursuing an education and made it such a pleasurable experience,” Cheung said.
HUCTW Director Bill Jaeger said that the Cambridge City Council has a long history of working with the union.
“It’s heartening for our members to know that the broader community, including elected officials, is paying attention and caring about what’s going on here,” said Jaeger.
“I hope it’s meaningful to the management negotiators also,” he continued.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A female undergraduate reported being assaulted in the Quincy House courtyard early Monday morning, according to an advisory emailed by the Harvard University Police Department to members of the Harvard community.
At 1:35 a.m., the student was grabbed by two males who tried to pull her towards a nearby building, she told police. She fought off the assailants and escaped the courtyard without injury, but police were unable to find the suspects, according to the advisory.
The email stated that HUPD has increased its presence in the area and encouraged anyone with knowledge of the incident to tell HUPD’s criminal investigation division.
The notice also asked University affiliates to be mindful of Harvard’s “urban setting,” to be vigilant day and night, and to travel in groups and on well-lit pathways without distraction from phones or earbuds after dark.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to provide information about the incident beyond that contained in the advisory.
Quincy House resident Carina R. Fish ’13 said that she was surprised to hear about the reported assault and is concerned about the safety of Quincy courtyard. She said she was worried in particular because Quincy courtyard has two unlocked entrances and is “one of the few courtyards that are open past a certain time.”
It has been six months since HUPD released an advisory alerting the Harvard community about an assault. The most recent advisories came in August, when two separate reports of rape, the first in Harvard Yard and the second near Oxford and Kirkland Streets, came within the span of five days.
Monday’s advisory came only minutes before the House Masters and resident dean of Lowell House, which is across the street from Quincy courtyard, emailed the House about two alleged crimes that both took place this weekend. The email detailed the theft of the House banner from Lowell dining hall and the vandalization of a bronze bust that sits in Lowell courtyard between entrways D and E. The statue, which depicts abolitionist poet James Russell Lowell and was on loan from the Harvard Art Museums, was removed from its pedestal and deposited into a trash can, which apparently tipped over, spilling the statue and garbage onto the ground.
Officials have released no evidence to suggest that the assault in Quincy courtyard and thetheft and vandalization in Lowell were related.
“This was not a harmless prank,” wrote Lowell House Masters Dorothy A. Austin and Diana L. Eck and acting resident dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03. “This was a crime.”
They added that HUPD is investigating and asked anyone who saw the theft to speak up.
“We are assuming that this act was not committed by someone in Lowell House but by someone outside our community,” the administrators wrote.
“We also assume that a group of people didn’t try to steal a massive piece of bronze without anyone in the house seeing it,” they added.

During their general meeting on Sunday, representatives of the Undergraduate Council discussed programming ideas for a small-scale “Junior Week” which is slated to take place Thursday through Saturday on Junior parents weekend.
The program is meant to serve as a pilot for what the UC hopes will become an annual event for juniors.
“Community building happens a lot in houses, at the beginning of freshman year, and the end of senior year, but it doesn’t happen that frequently throughout your time here, especially sophomore year and junior year.” UC President Tara Raghuveer ’14 said.
Some events that are being planned for the week include a “Ted Talks”-style event featuring juniors, a ice skating night at Harvard Skate, and a group outing to a Harvard women’s hockey game on March 2.
The UC is discussing potential collaboration options with various other student organizations like Harvard Student Agencies and Harvard Speaks. In addition, the Council is seeking a financial partnership with the COOP to provide giveaways and food.
In addition to discussions about Junior Week, the UC considered student group funding proposals during the meeting.
The UC Finance Committee rejected grant proposals by the Harvard African Students Association and the Harvard Undergraduate Mathematics Association in the final grants package presented at the general meeting.
HASA’s grant proposal was rejected because the grant would have been used to fund an event that was only open to members of the club and not to the full undergraduate community, which is a requirement for UC grants. The HUMA grant was rejected because it would have been used to fund outside labor.
“Since all the money is paid by students and we want the money to return to students, we can’t fund a professional,” said treasurer Jonathan Y. Li ’14.
The final $30,201.78 grants package was passed by unanimous consent.
The Undergraduate Council also voted 26-4 on an act urging the administration to “initiate the process of restoring the [Memorial Church] bell to ringing condition.”
The historic bell has remained out of commission ever since a crack was discovered more than a year ago. Since then, the hourly bell sounds have been produced using a speaker and a recording.
In response to a question about the timeframe for fixing the bell, Adams representative Antone Martinho ’13 said that the University’s lack of a timeline was precisely the problem he wanted to tackle with the legislation.
“Part of this is we are encouraging them to initiate the process without any further delay,” Martinho said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 400 Harvard students and community members flocked into Quincy Dining Hall on Friday night for a traditional Chinese New Year celebration, complete with a 12-course banquet and entertainment.
The annual celebration was organized by the Harvard-Radcliffe Chinese Students Association, and included performances by the Asian-American Dance Troupe, the Harvard Breakers, and the Harvard Din and Tonics.
Students who attended the event said they felt that it was a good venue for members of the community to celebrate the New Year in a meaningful and festive way.
“Since I couldn’t spend Chinese New Year with my family, I felt like this would be the perfect way to feel closer to home.” said attendee Connie M. Hsu ’16.
Presidents of HRCSA Lynelle T. Chen ’14 and Eric Y. H. Chung ’14 kicked off the event by welcoming guests into the Year of the Snake.
Throughout the night servers brought out many courses of Chinese food, including Bang Bang Chicken, Ma Po Tofu, Gan Bian String Beans, and mountains of white steamed rice.
But for students, the importance of the event went beyond the food and entertainment.
“Chinese New Year means bonding with all of my friends and gaining a deeper understanding of a culture that I very much consider a part of me,” Francisco X. Galdos ’15 said.
Following the first few courses, the Harvard Din and Tonics solicited many laughs with three singing routines, concluding with their hit “I Fell In Love with a McDonald’s Girl.”
Reylon A. Yount ’16, who performed a traditional Chinese instrument called the yangqin for the group, said that he found performing at this event especially meaningful.
“It was an honor to play for such an energetic audience,” Yount said. “It’s always wonderful to play at events like this, but the fact that it was a Chinese New Year’s banquet made it particularly special.”
During the final performance of the night two performers came on stage in a two-man lion costume and proceeded to throw oranges and lettuce leaves into the crowd. Attendee Jennifer Leung ’16 praised the final performance, saying that it “was exemplary of Chinese traditional culture,” and “energizing and lively.”
The event ended by honoring graduating seniors who have served on the HRCSA board in the past by recognizing them with a rose on stage.
Julia Hu ’13, who received a rose, said that the celebration “brought back great memories of my time on board.”
“I’m sure it will be the first of many events that will remind me that we’re really graduating,” she added.
Overall, organizers agreed that the event was a success in celebrating Chinese culture and heralding the Year of the Snake. Chung wrote in an email statement, “It can sometimes be a mad dash to the finish, but it is worth it every year when we realize how much Banquet has engaged our community and when we hear about how much our attendees have enjoyed the event.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Athanasios Orphanides, former governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank, argued during a two-hour study group at the Center of European Studies Friday that the main cause of the current financial crisis in the Euro Zone was political rather than economic in nature.
“When I look at why it is that we have this persistent situation that remains unresolved in the Euro area, I want to turn to something somewhat deeper—the Euro area’s structure and governance,” said Orphanides during the study group. “But why is it that having identified the problem we still have nothing to solve it? And there I go to the politics of the situation.”
Orphanides is currently a senior lecturer at MIT’s Sloan School of Management.
During his talk, Orphanides acknowledged that economic factors such as divergence in growth, competitiveness, sovereign bond yields, and unemployment figures in Euro Zone countries were in part to blame for the ongoing problems in Europe’s financial system. However, Orphanides said he thinks the situation was in large part caused by weak economic governance structures due to political mismanagement.
The 1992 treaty that created the Euro requires unanimous agreement among all member states in order to adjust the treaty so that it would allow for a long-term solution to a financial crisis.
Because of differing electoral cycles in each of the countries, important political decisions that could have mitigated problems in Europe’s economic climate were postponed, said Orphanides.
“The more countries you have, the more problems you are going to run into in finding the correct time when well-meaning governments could actually have agreed to [reach a decision] together,” Orphanides said.
The study session, entitled “Politics, Economics and the Euro Area Crises,” was part of a series of talks hosted by the Center of European Studies’ Greek Study Group throughout the semester.
The discussion drew a mixture of American and European citizens who, following Orphanides presentation, discussed the future of the European project.
Martin Møller Boje Rasmussen, a visiting Ph.D. student from Copenhagen Business School in Denmark, said he was impressed by the study group’s ability to conduct a high level and quality discussion on the causes and the future of the crisis in the Euro Zone.
Yannis M. Ioannides, a professor at Tufts and a co-chair of the Greek Study Group. echoed Rasmussen’s sentiments.
“Sometimes you have Harvard undergraduates who stun you with the depth of their knowledge,” Ioannides said. “That is why it is great to be at a university like this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and community members gathered in Lamont Forum Room on Monday evening for an open discussion on atheism. The panel event “Why Atheism Matters” was the kick-off for “Atheist Coming Out Week.”
The Harvard Community for Humanists, Atheists, and Agnostics planned the event and others which will happen this week with the goal of helping Harvard students who do not believe in God “drop the A word,” according to Sarah E. Coughlon ’15, HCHAA Vice President of Outreach.  HCHAA President Elliot A. Wilson ’15 noted that the label “atheist” is associated with considerable stigma.
“HCHAA sees Atheist Coming Out Week as an opportunity for nonreligious people on campus to feel safe asserting their identity, and it’s also a chance to destigmatize a word that, even on a secular college campus, can leave a bitter taste in people’s mouths,” Wilson wrote in an email.
Panelists at the event included psychology professor Steven Pinker and history and Social Studies professor Andrew J. Jewett. Humanist Chaplain, Greg M. Epstein, moderated the discussion.
To start off the event, Coughlon encouraged attendees to sign a “Coming Out” banner, take a pin labeled “Got Soul? Me Neither,” and read the “We are Atheists, and So Can You!” editorial published online in The Crimson on Monday.
After Epstein introduced the panelists, Pinker recounted his own experience “coming out” as an atheist. As he said, “I felt like I was confessing to murder. Since then, I have gotten completely used to it.”
According to Pinker, the term “atheist” is a misnomer because “you don’t define yourself by the [ideas] you don’t believe in.”
Pinker also expressed the idea that atheists do not need to compete with other religions. According to Pinker, many developments and institutions such as jazz music, the Constitution, and Harvard University have been the product of secular or humanist goals.
“One of the biggest advantages of being atheist is getting to sleep in on Sunday mornings. Who wants to give that up?” Pinker jokingly concluded.
Many students felt that the event was a great opportunity to reflect on their religious identities and conceptions of atheism.
“Concerning my stance on religion, I have been wrestling with a large number of conflicting feelings as of late. I felt that the secular perspective is frequently suppressed—stigmatized even,” said attendee Justin D. Porter ’16, “This event gave me a guilt-free avenue to explore the realistic possibility that I may be an atheist.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Eleanor T. Regan ’13 found herself alone in her apartment in Freiberg, Germany, with a defunct light bulb and limited knowledge of German, she turned to the first logical resource she could think of: Google Translate. After a week of leaving Post-It notes on her landlord’s door begging for a new light bulb, she was surprised at the lack of response.
“It was so stressful and frustrating. I can’t tell you how upsetting it was to not be able to communicate with this woman,” she said. “But  it was one of those moments that never would have happened at Harvard. It’s ridiculous to assume we’ll always live in a place where everything will be served to us.”
Regan, a Social Studies concentrator and former Crimson arts editor, studied abroad in Freiburg through the Harvard College Europe Program during the spring semester of her junior year. The light bulb incident was just one of countless situations that she says changed her outlook on living in the real world. Like Regan, many students at Harvard find studying abroad during the academic term a life-changing experience—one that teaches not only practical life skills but also broadens perspectives beyond the scope of Harvard’s classrooms.
“Studying abroad made me see the limitless possibility of things and just the pure power of imagination,” says Jinzhao Wang ’14, who also traveled to Freiburg last spring as a sophomore. “When I look back I could almost start crying because I learned so much.”
Yet despite the unique experience offered by study abroad, many undergraduates are still reluctant to leave behind aspects of college life—extracurriculars, friends, and House culture—in order to start anew in a foreign environment.
In the past decade, interest in study abroad has risen and fallen. Eleven years ago, during the 2001-2002 academic year, just 100 undergraduates engaged in term time study abroad, according to data from Harvard’s Office of International Education. That number grew to 242 by 2006-2007, but has since declined to 141 students during the 2010-2011 school year.
But many students who have studied abroad strongly believe that their experiences are ones that every Harvard student should have—and that any reason to avoid leaving Cambridge is an opportunity squandered.
“There are very few times in our life where taking an insane, crazy risk is viable. When else am I going to be able to go live in a country where I can’t speak the language and not have to hold down a job or pay rent?” Regan says.  “When else are we going to be put into that scenario where it’s so feasible, possible, safe?”
THE WORLD’S A CLASSROOM
Students recite an exhaustive list of positive experiences when asked about their time abroad.
“Studying abroad has been the most important thing I’ve done on a personal level, intellectual level, and just in terms of life in general,” says Miriam E. Psychas ’13, a joint history and literature and sociology concentrator who spent a semester in Cuba during her junior year. “Literally my college experience for me is divided in terms of pre-Cuba and post-Cuba.”
Whether traveling to the seat of industrialization in Europe or enduring the heat of Africa, participants say they find that leaving the confines of Harvard’s campus actually strengthens their academic purpose.
“As the world is becoming ever more globalized, as change is the new norm, I really feel people should take time studying abroad, actually taking a few classes with people around the world,” says Wang. “Traveling later on in life is different from studying with people your own age.”
Studying abroad can also provide students with a chance to encounter and learn from real world obstacles that may not be a factor on Harvard’s campus.
“I sometimes feel like Harvard hands us a lot of things... The website is easy to use. There’s no way to not get housing. It’s very hard to fail out,” says Regan. “It was great living with people in a place that wasn’t holding my hand.”
LEAVING HARVARD
For many Harvard students, these benefits are not enough to outweigh what students must give up when they leave campus.
Jeffrey C. Atwood ’13, a computer science concentrator, chose not to study abroad because he feared the repercussions of missing classes on campus. “I don’t really do anything academically that would involve a foreign country,” he says. “With my concentration, it wouldn’t have made sense to miss a whole semester.”
In particular, a number of seniors expressed the opinion that study abroad does not seem to accommodate academic pursuits in math and science. “It’s harder to fulfill your requirements abroad,” says Anne M. Baldwin ’13, a chemistry and physics concentrator. But she added that this was her personal perception as a freshman­—and not necessarily the reality.
Students also worry about the effect that leaving campus could have on friendships and extracurriculars.
“I only did study abroad during the summer because I just never wanted to miss a whole semester and be away from all of my friends,” says chemistry and physics concentrator Lawrence Chan ’13. “I don’t want to miss out on anything happening here on campus.”
C’EST LA VIE
Leaving Harvard may not be as difficult for math and science students as they think. In fact, many students concentrating in the more quantitative fields said they found that studying abroad actually complemented their curriculums.
Human and evolutionary biology concentrator and Crimson arts editor Leanna B. Ehrlich ’14 is currently studying abroad in Kenya’s Great Rift Valley at the Turkana Basin Institute Field School.
“It’s a field school for students studying archaeology, paleoanthropology and/or human evolution,” she writes in an email from Kenya. “It seemed like a perfect fit—I’d always wanted to take classes in related fields that would help me get a greater understanding of my major, but just hadn’t gotten around to it yet.”
The Office of International Education lists numerous math and science study abroad programs, ranging from the Harvard College Program in Cuba, which offers courses in environmental and medical sciences, to the Organization for Tropical Studies, through which students can study biology in Costa Rica or South Africa. Additionally, the OIE allows students to find or design independent programs tailored to their concentration.
That going abroad requires leaving behind friends and extracurriculars for a semester, however, is unavoidable—and can sometimes lead to lost opportunities.
“It was definitely hard emotionally to leave these smaller communities at Harvard of which I had been a part,” says Wang. “I wanted to run for president of a dance group but I obviously wasn’t there for a whole semester and there were always new members coming in. So I didn’t win the election.”
But for Wang and many of her peers, the experiences offered by study abroad more than compensate for those lost in Cambridge. Wang took private voice lessons for the first time at a jazz school in Germany and realized that in addition to dancing, she loves to sing and act.
“It was really hard seeing the email with the election results but looking back that was just a small setback,” she explains. “I didn’t win but I was still passionate about performing arts and worked harder for my singing and involving myself more in theater and dancing more with the group and now I’m running again for co-president.”
Almost all students interviewed for this article who spent a semester abroad echoed Wang’s sentiment: the initial fears and potential drawbacks of leaving are not sufficient reason to reject studying abroad.
“I don’t know anyone who has regretted studying abroad,” says Psychas. “But I do know a lot of people who have regretted not studying abroad. It’s hard to see when you’re a sophomore but once you’re a senior it’ll be really obvious.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With her team up, 4-2, against No. 4 Trinity through the first two rotations, sophomore Amanda Sobhy took center stage at the Brady Squash Courts in New Haven, Conn. The No. 2 Harvard women’s squash team (15-1, 6-1 Ivy) was just one win away from successfully defending its national title.
It was the second time that Sobhy and her opponent, Kanzy El Defraway of the Bantams, had faced off this season. Though Sobhy bested her opponent, 3-1, when they first met just over a week ago, El Defraway handed the sophomore the first game loss of her collegiate career in that early February meeting.
This time around, Sobhy wasted little time, stringing together 11-8, 11-7, and 11-8 wins to pick up the victory and seal the national title for the Crimson.
“Amanda has been a perennial force at No. 1,” co-captain Natasha Kingshott said. “She clinched the fifth match for us. It did come down to the end, but we had total confidence in her play there.”
Harvard ended the tournament with a 5-4 win over Trinity to take home the Howe Cup for the third time in the past four years and 14th time in program history.
“It was a really tough weekend, both mentally and physically,” Kingshott said. “But this day, for every individual player, whether they won or lost, was just the culmination of a whole season’s worth of hard work and dedication.... We’ve had some bumps along the road, but we’ve proven ourselves to be a resilient team. I really think we played our best squash today.”
The Crimson began its title defense campaign with a 9-0 rout of No. 7 Stanford on Friday in the quarterfinal match.
Harvard had a much closer contest in the semifinals, when the Crimson took on No. 3 Penn in a Saturday afternoon showdown. The match was tied, 3-3, after the first two rotations of players. But Harvard pulled away for a 6-3 victory with wins in the final three matches. Freshman Michelle Gemmell pulled out a 3-2 win in the No. 4 slot, Sobhy picked up a 3-0 victory at No. 1, and co-captain Sarah Mumanachit beat her opponent, 3-1, at No. 7.
The win over the Quakers pitted the Crimson against the Bantams in the finals after Trinity upset No. 1 Princeton in Saturday’s other semifinal contest.
“The whole weekend has really been a roller coaster,” Mumanachit said. “We were really hyped to play Princeton hopefully, since we wanted to avenge our loss earlier this season. But we were happy to play Trinity in the finals. They are really good competitors. It was really close and exciting.”
In Harvard’s first meeting with the Bantams this season, the Crimson came away with a comfortable 7-2 victory.
“There was a little bit of pressure, since we had a convincing win over them last week, but we knew they were underdogs and ready to challenge us,” Kingshott said. “I think we took it in stride. Throughout the season, we’ve shown that we can handle the pressure.”
Harvard jumped out to an early 3-0 lead on Sunday, as sophomore Haley Mendez, Kingshott, and sophomore Megan Murray picked up wins in the No. 3, No. 6, and No. 9 positions, respectively. But the Bantams would go on to win two of the next three matches in the second flight. Playing at No. 8, Julianne Chu lost her match in three straight games, while senior Laura Gemmell suffered her second loss of the season by the same margin at No. 2. Freshman Saumya Karki picked up the lone win for the Crimson in the round with a 3-0 win at No. 5.
“We took the early lead, which was really great for our confidence,” Kingshott said. “[But] Trinity is a really formidable opponent. They were hungry for this win as well, and so they came out firing in the next couple rounds.”
Though Michelle Gemmell and Mumanachit suffered losses in the No. 4 and No. 7 positions, respectively, Sobhy’s 3-0 win gave Harvard the edge and clinched the national title for the Crimson.
“It hasn’t even really set in,” Kingshott said. “I’m just so proud of everyone. When you put in so much work as an individual, and you see all the work your teammates put in, to see it all come together is one of the most gratifying experiences. We couldn’t have ended it in a better way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With a historic win against Princeton two weekends ago in the books, the No. 16 Harvard men’s swimming and diving team had just one dual meet left on its schedule. Having taken down all other opponents, the Crimson (9-0, 7-0 Ivy) had its eyes set on an undefeated dual meet season. All that stood in the way was one last matchup against conference foe Penn.
“That [win against Princeton] was huge for us,” co-captain Greg Roop said. “We had never beaten Princeton in their home pool before, so we had a tremendous amount of momentum coming off of that. Everyone was really excited to get back to the pool.”
Harvard would have to wait an extra week to face off against the Quakers due to weather conditions that made travel near impossible last weekend. But it was business as usual for the Crimson, who took down Penn, 195-98, to conclude its perfect season.
“For this meet, more so than in the past, [we] were orienting ourselves for our championships meets at the end of the season,” fellow co-captain Owen Wurzbacher said. “Today was really about toughness and competing and staying aggressive. We did that.”
Harvard got off to a hot start, as sophomore Chuck Katis and juniors Jack Pretto, Oliver Lee, and Chris Satterthwaite combined for a time of 1:30.66 to win the 200 medley relay. Lee went on to pick up a victory in the 100 butterfly later that afternoon.
The Crimson picked up wins in the next three events. Sophomore Mike Gaudiani finished with a time of 9:23.61 to claim a victory in the 1000 freestyle. Roop edged out teammates freshman Ty Rocca and senior Ryan Cutter for a 1-2-3 finish for Harvard in the 200 freestyle. Pretto hit the wall in a time of 50.24 for a win in the 100 backstroke.
The Crimson concluded with wins in eight of the final 12 events, for a total of 12 victories on the day. Freshman Christian Carbone and classmate Christian Yeager won the 200 butterfly and the 200 backstroke, respectively, and junior Danny Crigler picked up a win in the 50 free. Crigler also finished second to sophomore Griffin Schumacher in the 100 free. Roop rounded out the top three in the event for another 1-2-3 finish for Harvard.
The Crimson also swept the podium in the 500 free. Satterthwaite finished in a time of 4:36.23 to take top honors, closely followed by Gaudiani and fellow sophomore John Bailey. The trio finished within three seconds of each other and over eight seconds ahead of their next nearest competitor.
Sophomore Michael Mosca claimed top honors in both of the meet’s diving events, taking home first in the three-meter and one-meter contests. Harvard claimed the top four spots in both events.
The win on Senior Day capped the Crimson’s second undefeated season in the past three years.
“It was a little bit surreal, after the meet when I realized it was the last time I would ever swim a meet in our home pool,” Roop said. “But it was so sweet going out knowing you had beaten everyone in the league.”
In addition to being Senior Day, another added focus for the day’s events was on the team’s “Ironman” challenge.
“We have a tradition on the team every year where the freshman who best exudes the qualities that characterize HMSD is elected Ironman for his class,” Wurzbacher said. “He is required to swim in every single heat of every single event. It’s a really challenging individual thing to do. One of the most fun parts of the season is being out there, supporting him through that.”
This year, freshman Jacob Luna was chosen for the Class of 2016. In addition, Katis, a sophomore, competed in all the day’s swimming events as well. Katis, who has already qualified for this year’s NCAA Championships, was unable to complete his Ironman last year due to scheduling issues.
Now with its dual meet schedule concluded, Harvard has its eyes set solely on its championship meets in the coming weeks. The Crimson’s main goal for the entire season has been reclaiming the Ivy League title from No. 20 Princeton.
“The best perspective we can have is to view ourselves as underdogs,” Wurzbacher said. “The facts are that Princeton has won the Ivy League Championship every single one of the past four years; Princeton’s the favorite. They’ve won four years in a row, but we’re going in to upset them.”
In total, the Crimson earned first place in 12 of the day’s 16 events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While a few members of the Harvard ski team will be back on the very same hill at Middlebury less than three weeks from now at NCAA Championships, most of the skiers enjoyed their last races of the carnival season at the Breadloaf and Snow Bowl.
This weekend marked the last regular season races, as the team now looks ahead to the EISA Championships and NCAA Championships in the weeks to come.
On the Nordic side, freshman Emily Hanna led the Crimson women for the first day, finishing 35th overall with a time of 17:36. Junior Chris Stock paced the men, placing 16th with a time of 27:16, keeping his hopes of an NCAA berth alive with the result.
“Friday was our best classic result of the year and one of the best days we’ve had as a team this season,” Harvard Nordic coach Chris City said. “Saturday’s race was less good. We had a couple of people get injured and one person who was sick, so we were a little short-handed.”
Two other Crimson women finished in the top 50 on Friday, with freshman Annie Harvieux and senior Alena Tofte—who was returning from an injury—placing 41st and 42nd, respectively.
Saturday proved to be more of a challenge for the Nordic team, whose top finisher on the women’s side was unable to break the top 40. Despite the result, City credited junior Jen Rolfes—who placed 43rd—with one of her best races of the season. On the men’s side, sophomore Akeo Maifeld-Carucci came in 19th after starting close to the back.
“[Jen Rolfes] did the same thing that Akeo did,” City said. “It was a mass start race, and she was almost at the back of the field and skied her way all the way up. She did it the hard way, by having to pass a lot of people.”
City was impressed with the speed that his skiers were still showing toward the end of the season, especially the freshmen that are still adjusting to a college racing schedule. The Nordic roster boasts five freshmen.
“Overall I’m pleased with how we are skiing this late in the season,” City said. “It’s a time when a lot of teams are getting slower and we’re getting faster, so that’s great…. They’re doing a good job of getting rest and recovery during the week so that when we get to the weekends and we’re racing, they’re still feeling reasonably fresh.”
The alpine team also remained competitive throughout the weekend, as junior Rebecca Nadler—the first Harvard skier to win an NCAA title—led the way in the giant slalom with a ninth place finish in 2:11.55. Nadler followed up the performance with a 15th place finish in the slalom after she shaved almost a second off of her time in the second run.
“I know I need to put two strong ones together,” Nadler said. “That’s the hill that NCAAs are going to be on, so I was happy to get at least one fast run in and know the hill a little better.”
Senior Catherine Sheils came in 29th overall despite a mistake in the second run that added over two seconds to her previous time.
The men had more difficulty breaking into the upper reaches of the standings. In both events, freshman Matthew Mansson was the only skier to finish both runs in both events, coming in 43rd overall in the giant slalom and the slalom.
Freshman Jack Stobierski qualified for the second round in the slalom for the first time in his career, but he did not finish.
“It’s pretty tough with the top 60 cutoff [to qualify for the second race],” Nadler said. “The men’s team is competing against guys who were on national teams and skiing world cups. Our guys don’t quite have the mileage that those guys do.”
The alpine team also traveled back to Hanover to make up a race that was cancelled last weekend due to poor weather. The conditions weren’t much better this time, and the skiers had to ride a snow cat up the mountain after the chairlifts were closed due to strong winds.
Harvard had to contend with tough conditions all weekend, and City credits the Nordic team’s success with its ability to handle the variable weather.
“The temperature changed a lot, and there was some fresh snow and some ice,” City said. “It’s easy on days when the snow isn’t perfect to let that rattle you. We did a nice job just coming out and skiing our race and knowing that the skis will work well in some places and not in others.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Around this time last year, the nation was in the throes of Linsanity. This year, a less heralded Harvard professional athlete is just getting started.
Alex Killorn ’12 notched his first career NHL goal Saturday for the Tampa Bay Lightning to help the team to an overtime win, 6-5, over the Florida Panthers. Killorn slid a wrister past the right pad of Panthers goaltender Jose Theodore to put Tampa Bay up, 2-1.
The center from Montreal has made an immediate impact for Tampa Bay after he was called up to start on February 10th at Madison Square Garden. In his first four games, Killorn has posted one goal, one assist, and a plus-one rating while playing on a line with Lightning franchise player Vincent Lecavalier.
The Lightning tabbed Killorn 77th overall in the 2007 NHL Entry Draft before a senior prep school season in which the center scored 55 points in 24 games for Deerfield Academy. At Harvard, Killorn led the Crimson in goals during his junior and senior seasons. The government concentrator graduated as a CCM Hockey All-American after posting a tournament-high 10 points during the ECAC postseason.
You can watch Killorn's first goal and read more about it here.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you think of skiing as simply a fun sport to watch in the Winter Olympics or a recreational activity when there’s snow outside (thanks, Nemo!), 26 people at Harvard would beg to differ. Although there’s no way to watch these alpine and Nordic skiers unless you make the three-hour drive to Vermont, The Back Page’s new series presents five things you should know about their sport to support their teams from the comfort of your dorm.
5. GIANT
No, giant slalom does not equate a larger mountain that alpine skiers must ski down. Instead, the gates that a skier must maneuver around are spaced further apart than they are in slalom, yielding a slightly slower speed than in its sister event. While alpine skiing is also composed of the “super giant slalom” (even more space between the poles) and “downhill” (few turns, and as the name suggests, going straight down a mountain), collegiate races often use only the technical events—giant slalom and slalom.
4. Skates or skis
When you looked outside your window this weekend and saw people skiing around on the streets, Nordic coach Chris City would term that “Classic” skiing.  In an actual race, classic skiing is done in parallel tracks, but the Nemo skiers resemble more of classic skiers than they would the “skate” style. In skate skiing, the skiers look more like skaters than normal skiers (with the parallel skis)—the skis are angled outwards and often yields a faster speed through the course.
3. Size does matter
If you see the skiers walking around campus with their ski bags, don’t be alarmed by how heavy their bags look—they have more than just one pair of skis. For alpine skiers, GS skis are often longer and wider than slalom skis to keep as much contact with the snow between gates, while slalom skis are shorter to increase speed. On the Nordic side, skate skis are often shorter than their classic counterparts, causing a need for ski bags with a lot of room.
2. Waxing their equipment
 
When a skier talks about waxing before a race, rest assured that they’re (probably) not talking about a body part. In order to make their skis glide faster, skiers will wax before a race—their skis, that is. By applying a thin layer of glide wax (for alpine skis or Nordic skate skis) or grip wax (for Nordic classic skis), the skis develop a thin film in contact with the snow that makes the ski friction with the snow optimal.
1. Crimson stars
Although the Harvard skiers may be competing far from home, success is never far from their grasp. Last year, alpine skier Rebecca Nadler took home the Crimson’s first ever national title at the NCAA Championships in Montana and is looking for a repeat title in 2013. On the Nordic side, freshman skier Emily Hannah recently made it to the 2013 FIS Junior World Championships for the second time in a row, a step which her coach calls a catalyst for the rookie to possibly make it onto the US National team someday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stakes were high across the river at the Murr Center, as Harvard men’s squash took on Yale (11-3, 5-2 Ivy) with an Ivy League title on the line. The Crimson (15-2, 6-1) and its chief rival were tied at the top of the Ivy League at 5-1 in conference play going into their first match since ‘Nemo’ disrupted both squads’ schedules.
As has been the case in recent meetings between the two schools, the match was closely contested throughout and featured multiple thrillers. In the wee hours of the night, Harvard proved too strong and took the victory, 6-3, earning a share of the Ivy League championship in front of the capacity crowd.
“[Crimson coach Mike Way] always uses a quote from Michael Jordan,” junior Brandon McLaughlin said.  “’When the pressure is on we are the ones who stay the same and everyone else changes.’”
The title is the first for the men under the tutelage of Way, who is now in his third season with the squad.
“I’m delighted,” Way said. “It was a team of young men.  They showed what they are made of.”
The clincher came from the squad’s co-captain Zeke Scherl who lined cross-court to cap off a 3-1 victory over his Yale opponent with an 11-5 win in the final game.
Going into the third and final flight, the Crimson had control, edging its opponents 4-3 after junior Ali Farag took care of business in straight sets. In the final two matches, the Crimson secured key victories from Scherl and Gary Power.
Though both squads had opportunities to pull ahead, the match stayed even throughout, with five of the nine matches being decided in five games.
Junior Nigel Koh emerged victorious in the first of these early five-gamers. After taking control of the match toward the end of the fourth frame, Koh turned it on to convincingly win the final frame, 11-0.
“For Nigel [Koh] to win in five at the number three position was really vital,” coach Way said.
McLaughlin also had a big match. He outlasted Yale’s No. 2 Hywel Robinson after falling to him in four games earlier in the season.
“He’s a physical player,” McLaughlin said.  “I tried to control the center of the court as much as possible and keep him running so he couldn’t really get in my way.”
The night was one of tribute to seniors Scherl, Jason Michas, Alexander Ma, Charles Cabot, Shaw McKean, who each played his last match at home.
“They led in the gym and with work ethic and they were just awesome,” Way said.
The night ended with mixed results for the seniors in the nine-man rotation.
While Scherl ultimately gave Harvard the advantage, his co-captain, Michas suffered his first loss of the season.
“Our two captains did a stellar job [and] led by example”
The last times these sides faced each other, the victory was decided in the final match. The Bulldogs emerged victorious in that one, defending its home court. The Crimson’s last victory over Yale came in November of 2011.
“It’s always tough playing Yale,” McLaughlin said. “It’s a big match.”
Farag remained unscathed in the No. 1 spot, handling his match against Yale’s No. 1 Kenneth Chang.
Both teams dropped their only match of the season to Princeton. Yale took three individual matches against the Tigers two weeks after Harvard managed four.
“It sort of woke them up,” Way said of the loss to Princeton.
The match puts the Crimson’s overall winning percentage at 85 percent on the season.
Harvard’s postseason will begin next week when it heads to New Haven for the CSA team championships.

The Harvard Dems will weigh in tonight on both the politics of the Commonwealth and a politically charged issue on Harvard's campus.
The Harvard College Democrats plan to vote tonight to endorse a candidate vying to fill the Senate seat vacated earlier this month by new Secretary of State John F. Kerry. They will choose between two Democrats, U.S. Rep. Edward J. Markey of the Fifth Congressional District and Rep. Stephen F. Lynch of the Eighth Congressional District, who will face off in a primary set to occur on April 30.
 
“It’s time for Harvard Progressives to formally exercise their voice, and the Senate race presents a clear choice,” Harvard Dems president Simon M. Thompson '14 said in a press release. Thompson added that a recent poll shows the race—once considered to be a Markey landslide—tightening.
 
Whoever emerges on the Democratic side will almost surely be favored over the Republican nominee in the June 25 special election, according to recent polls. So far, only Daniel B. Winslow, the relatively unknown state representative from Norfolk, Mass., has entered the race for the Republicans. 
 
The Harvard Dems' endorsement event is scheduled to occur this evening at 8 p.m. in Boylston 103. State Rep. Carl Sciortino, who represents neighborhoods in Medford and Somerville, will speak for the Markey campaign, while Braintree Mayor Joseph C. Sullivan will argue the case for Lynch, according to a statement released by the Harvard Dems on Saturday.
The Harvard Dems will also vote whether to endorse Divest Harvard, a student campaign advocating divestment of University funds from the fossil fuel industry. Divestment became the official position of the Undergraduate Council following a College-wide referendum this past November.

Does seeing another country from a distance constitute foreign policy experience? Is refudiate a word? Is North Korea one of America's allies? Most Harvard students (and for $55,000 a year we'd hope all of our professors) would have no problem answering no to all these questions. All except our newest member of faculty, according to one blog.
Satirical blog The Daily Currant published an article yesterday claiming former governor of Alaska and famed "mama grizzly" Sarah Palin would be joining Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government as a visiting scholar in the fall, teaching classes on the war on terror, welfare, religion and oil and gas development.
Despite the fact that their post was, well, a joke, Twitter saw some interesting, rather serious reactions to it. "How can Harvard use Palin and scholar in the same sentence?" one user asked, while another claimed, "those students will tear Sarah Palin up. Let's see how long she lasts in that classroom."
With Palin's record on geography, literacy, and, well, politics, perhaps it's a good thing we won’t get the chance to find out.
