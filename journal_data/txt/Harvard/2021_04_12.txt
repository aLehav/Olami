After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a way, I’m grateful for the pandemic.
Of course, I don’t mean to suggest that the past year was pain-free. Many lives have been damaged in ways that are too significant to simply pass over. More than half a million lives have been lost in the U.S. alone, and by a conservative estimate, more than four and a half million Americans have lost close kin to the coronavirus. Beyond this, the upending of the economy has wiped out many thousands of families’ stored-up savings.
On a smaller scale, even those Harvard students lucky enough to escape physical harm have suffered losses. Beyond the emotional drain of an online year, almost all of us have had to manage the dull emptiness that accompanies each milestone we miss out on marking. Current freshmen have lost their high-school graduations, for example, and current seniors will lose their commencement. These events are more than just parties: They are a crucial way in which we take stock of what we have accomplished, close off a portion of our lives, and move on to the next. It would be foolish and cruel to claim that these emotional and physical injuries are somehow insignificant.
Yet, despite the vacant spaces these losses have left, our lives didn’t pause for Covid-19. They may have gone un-commemorated, but milestones have kept passing by for virtually every one of us. Since our lives were ostensibly put on hold a year ago, my classmates and I have graduated from high school, arrived at college, and finished most of our freshman year. We have made friendships that will last for decades and begun to determine the personal and professional trajectories of those decades. These are not just nominal achievements with little bearing on the rest of our lives. Rather, they entail transformations significant enough to reshape much of them.
It is tempting to look at a list of good things this year brought and retort that they would have been better in a pandemic-free time. But it is not clear that they would have.
An in-person graduation might seem like it would have been far better than one held online, but to me, even this is questionable. If I had left high school in front of my friends and family in a cap and gown, I would have certainly felt more fulfilled in the moment. But I would not have been forced, as I was by the strangeness of a virtual ceremony, to reflect on how instead of finding fulfillment in the familiarity of a ritual, I could find it elsewhere, even internally. I would not have been forced to look back on high school without the anodyne crutch of a traditional ceremony. I realize now that this forced reflection, though unpleasant in the moment, brought me closer to the person I would like to be. How can I say whether fulfillment then or fulfillment now would be better?
Similarly, I am sure that in a normal year I would have met far more people and made far more friends in my first semester of college. But in getting to know so many more people, I might have failed to develop relationships as deep as the ones I have with those I did meet. In getting to know many more friends, I might have lost the opportunity to walk through Cambridge with them for hours at night, talking about every topic under the sun. How can I say whether the friends I would have had are better than the ones I have now?
My point is not that we should just “look on the bright side.” I am not saying that I prefer virtual graduations to physical ones, or even that I prefer the people I have met to the ones I theoretically would have without the coronavirus’s interference. Instead, I think that the two possibilities are simply incomparable.
And even if it is possible to decide which of two events would be better, the task becomes much harder when those events accumulate over many months. A pandemic-free year would have differed from this one in countless ways, both significant and mundane, and it is impossible to predict the effect all those differences would have had on us. We are shaped by the people we meet and the choices we have open to us, and this shaping is comprehensive — it even affects our value judgments. What I want now, I might not have wanted in a life without the coronavirus. Who am I to declare that I would have been better off in that life, if the person living it would have wanted very different things than I?
If, then, we cannot adjudicate between this life and that one, we are faced with two options: We could simply turn to bitterness in reaction to all the damage this year has done to us, or we could look to a different interpretation of this year, one that is not deceptively saccharine but bittersweet. We can acknowledge the suffering that has occurred but simultaneously celebrate the good things this year has brought — things that might never have arisen otherwise.
I think we should choose the second. This pandemic has shaped us, for better or for worse, and we cannot escape the influence it has had on our characters and the way we view the world. So while we mourn its losses, let us also embrace the transformations it has brought. After all, these transformations have become an inescapable part of who we are.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On March 30, the state of Texas filed an amicus brief supporting the anti-affirmative action group Student for Fair Admissions in its latest attempt to have its twice-lost lawsuit challenging Harvard’s admissions process retried. The filing, put out by the office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, emphatically supports SFFA’s call for the Supreme Court to overturn Grutter v. Bollinger, a landmark 2003 case that sanctioned affirmative action.
Students for Fair Admissions, which first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court on Feb. 25 to review a pair of lower court rulings that decided in favor of Harvard’s use of race in admissions and, conversely, against SFFA’s assertion that the College illegally discriminates against Asian American applicants. This assertion is the lever by which SFFA aims to dismantle affirmative action nationwide.
While we are disappointed by Texas joining SFFA’s ongoing assault on race-conscious admissions, we are not at all surprised by it. In less than five years, SFFA has led two unsuccessful challenges (one which the Supreme Court did weigh in on) against the University of Texas at Austin’s race-conscious admissions process. Now, having failed to dismantle affirmative action within the state of Texas, SFFA has shifted its focus to Harvard. Ken Paxton, for whom this cause hits geographically and ideologically close to home, has naturally and opportunely hopped on the bandwagon.
Inevitably, this move by Ken Paxton — which is by no means out of character — cannot be taken at face value. The Texas attorney general has a penchant for intervening in national lawsuits and making dangerous and dubious legal claims. This past December, Paxton was involved in a lawsuit challenging U.S. presidential election results in four battleground states. The high-profile, toothless case was quickly thrown away by the conservative-majority Supreme Court, which affirmed that Texas had no standing to bring about the case in the first place. To that end, Paxton’s history of intervening in affairs in which he has no business or basis for involvement makes it difficult to take his current claims all that seriously.
Beyond that, Paxton’s decision to write an amicus brief in support of SFFA seems likely driven by his own political incentives. Opposition to affirmative action has long stood as a rallying point within our nation’s culture wars, and it has thus been wielded by politicians to generate political fervor and energy amongst Republicans. Paxton’s current support of SFFA positions him at the heart of such cultural tides, and clearly maps onto this time-tested and troubling political tact. To that end, Texas’s support for SFFA proves nothing about the veracity of the lawsuit. Instead, it seems to embody a self-motivated attempt to energize supporters by giving credence to a voice that weaponizes the very real racism endured by Asian Americans, while simultaneously furthering a nefarious agenda that seeks to upend affirmative action.
In the wake of last month’s shootings in Atlanta, we find SFFA’s exploitation of Asian American narratives to be particularly egregious. Using Asian American students as a token minority to advance the claim that race-conscious admissions are not only unnecessary but harmful perpetuates the model minority myth — a societal fabrication that not only characterizes other minority racial groups as less capable than Asian Americans but also blatantly paints the Asian American community as inherently successful and devoid of struggle. This myth has contributed to the time-tested, troubling silence on anti-Asian racism that continues to pervade our society — and in reinforcing this myth, SFFA is inevitably fueling the flames of a troubling blend of societal oversight and hatred that has proven to be not only depraved, but deadly.
Portraying affirmative action as uniformly damaging to Asian American students also perpetuates further disenfranchisement of Asian Americans who don’t fit the model minority stereotype. Indeed, the Asian American community’s relationship to affirmative action varies greatly along socioeconomic lines — for instance, sub-groups at a greater systemic disadvantage, such as Southeast Asians who arrived as refugees, often directly benefit from affirmative action. In light of rising attacks on Asian Americans due to this same dangerous monolithic characterization and erasure, we all must pay greater attention to the varied experiences of Asian Americans in this country — including their relationship to higher education.
Texas and SFFA have posited themselves as allies in identifying the wrong solutions to the right problems. If the state of Texas is truly worried about college accessibility, perhaps it should focus on improving its own internal, bleeding education system — the state ranks 43rd nationally in educational attainment — rather than hollowly casting the admissions processes of another college over a thousand miles away. And if SFFA is truly worried about racism in higher education, perhaps it should stop contributing to it.

Four Harvard affiliates were among the 184 recipients of the prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship, an annual award recognizing exceptional scholarly and artistic achievement, the Guggenheim Foundation announced Thursday.
The award’s mission, according to the Foundation, is to “further the development of scholars and artists by assisting them to engage in research in any field of knowledge and creation in any of the arts, under the freest possible conditions.” Since the Foundation’s establishment in 1925, it has received around 3,000 applications for its fellowship competition each year.
This year’s recipients span fields as vast as Fiction, Music Composition, and Engineering. From Harvard, the awardees hail from the departments of English and History, as well as the Radcliffe Institute fellowship program.
Paul J. Kosmin, professor of ancient history, won his award for his book monograph titled “The Ancient Shore,” which studies the shoreline in antiquity. The work reunites different histories along the shoreline, typically with “riotous differences” spanning different fields of expertise, into a singular coherent narrative.
“One of the goals of this project is to take a more global perspective and integrate the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, as well as the Atlantic Ocean,” Kosmin said, noting that ancient Greek history is typically Mediterranean-centered. “Ultimately, at heart, the project is about asking how humans orient themselves to the natural world.”
English senior lecturer Laura van den Berg was awarded for her prose project titled “Florida Diary,” which was inspired by her Central Florida hometown. She said that after returning to Florida at the start of the pandemic, she was able to revisit personal memories, learn about local histories and the impacts of climate change, and merge this with a narrative of illness and pandemics.
“I think the product is best described as a sort of hybrid work of memoir and speculative fiction,” she said. “So it’s taking those two genres and kind of merging them together.”
Another fellowship went to Paul Yoon, a Harvard English senior lecturer and the husband of van den Berg. His project was a novel, which he plans to continue over the next year, according to van den Berg.
Crystal Z. Campbell, a Harvard Radcliffe Film Study Center fellow, received the fellowship for work on her experimental feature film, titled “SLICK,” that pays homage to the history of Oklahoma through the lens of the Tulsa Race Massacre and its lingering effects on the city of Tulsa.
“SLICK will reframe the history of black townships in Oklahoma, oil, and the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre to speculate on these triadic connections, and how this legacy of domestic terror continues to shape Tulsa and the state of Oklahoma in the present day,” she wrote in an email.
Campbell plans to use her award to continue filming and researching for the project. She will travel back and forth to Tulsa to work with performers, musicians, audio engineers, editors, and secure equipment and software.
Most of the fellows said they will use the award to continue producing scholarship in their respective fields.
“I’m going to be doing the final third of the project, which is the bit which sort of treats the shoreline as a thinking space where people ask big questions about the origins of the universe, the deep past, the future, the mutability of the world,” Kosmin said of his plans.
“The award is a critical nudge to continue, to keep on,” Campbell wrote regarding the significance of the fellowship. “I get emotional thinking about ancestors whose work I'm building from, researchers who guide my practice, and so many who are awaiting acknowledgement, and I aim to continue trying to amplify their stories with art.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs expressed his excitement for three areas of study within the Sciences Division — including the recently-approved Quantum Science and Engineering graduate program — in an interview last week.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted in favor of the creation of a Quantum Science and Engineering program at Harvard at last Tuesday’s faculty meeting.
“We are at the forefront of trying to understand and exploit the really spooky elements of quantum mechanics in a way that may well have significant technological impact on society,” Stubbs said of the new program.
School of Engineering and Applied Sciences professor Evelyn L. Hu, who advocated for the new program along with Physics professor John M. Doyle, told FAS faculty in the meeting that it is important Harvard adopt a graduate program in quantum science to contribute to the ever-growing field.
“Crafting this Ph.D. program in Quantum Science and Engineering has been a labor of love for all of us who have been involved with it,” Hu said. “We believe that this is a special moment in time to introduce such a program because of the proliferation of discoveries and opportunities in this new area.”
Stubbs said in the interview, which took place last Monday, that the design process is “just getting started” for a new building — located at 60 Oxford Street — that will house the program.
In addition to the soon-to-be graduate program, Stubbs also said he is excited about the original scholarship Harvard is undertaking in climate science and engineering.
“We would love to find ways for Harvard to be more impactful, and to exploit the fact that we have a combination of strengths across the different schools at Harvard that is essentially unrivaled,” Stubbs said. “We’re a powerhouse across the board — of basic and applied sciences, the regulatory elements, the legal elements, the human elements, the policy elements — of, ‘How do we confront one of mankind’s biggest challenges?’”
“We’re in the process of putting together a strategic approach to how we can be more impactful in that domain,” he added.
Lastly, Stubbs pointed to interdisciplinary research in neuroscience and machine learning — what he called “cognition writ large” — as a “big intellectual opportunity” and priority for the FAS’s Science Division.
“How can machine learning work so terrifyingly well for algorithms that are really in some ways rather pedestrian, and how can you use that to good effect in data analysis in the sciences?” Stubbs raised. “Conversely, how can you take your understanding of simple biological neural systems and apply that to computer programs, and how do you make the ping pong ball go back and forth there?”

U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) delivered opening remarks at a Harvard-sponsored panel Friday during which local entrepreneurs and non-profit leaders discussed how they navigated the pandemic-induced recession.
Business School senior fellow and former U.S. Small Business Administration administrator Karen G. Mills ’75 moderated the discussion, which sought to illuminate the challenges small business owners have endured over the past year and “consider what the future will look like,” per the event’s webpage.
Rock City Pizza owner Joseph J. Charles, Cambridge Chamber of Commerce President David P. Maher, Brighton Main Streets director Aidan M. McDonough, and Big Dipper Hospitality co-founder Rachel Miller Munzer shared firsthand accounts of the pandemic’s impact during the panel discussion.
Pressley said small businesses have been “destabilized” and “devastated” by the pandemic and recognized the acute need for relief she has seen in her district.
She added her leadership philosophy is to “cooperatively govern,” saying she is “a firm believer that the people closest to the pain should be the closest to the power.”
“It’s how we better understand the complexity of the challenges, but where we develop the most innovative solutions,” Pressley said. “And then I can, in turn, practice what is my love language — which is policy — and ensure that that policy is responsive.”
The additional $7 billion allocated for the Paycheck Protection Program in the recently passed American Rescue Plan Act was one example of how “policy solutions improve when lawmakers actively enlist and engage the expertise of those closest to the pain,” according to Pressley.
“My team and I reached out proactively to small business owners across the district, and we enlisted them in improving the program for the next rounds of funding, and we were able to create set-asides for micro-businesses with 10 employees, nonprofits, and nearly half of the remaining funds of the program for those employers with less than 200 employees,” she said regarding the Paycheck Protection Program.
“That was an intervention and advocacy that was responsive to what I heard directly from small business owners,” she added.
The ultimate goal of recovery, Pressley said, should not be a return to “a pre-COVID status quo normal.”
“This is the opportunity and the time for reconstruction — that we chart a brighter path forward, one that is more just and more equitable, one that centers the dignity of every member of our community — and we will do that together,” she added.
Pressley also lauded the resilience of small business owners and thanked them for their contributions to her district.
“Thank you for being good neighbors. Thank you for caring about your community. Thank you for all the ways in which you contribute to our culture, to our economy,” she said.
Mills began the panel portion of the event by saying small businesses are critical to the country and that the Covid-19 pandemic has made it “the most challenging time” for them.
She went on to ask panelists — entrepreneurs and city leaders — about the innovations they have made.
Munzer said she shut down three restaurants “as soon as the pandemic hit.” One of her business partners suggested they convert one of the restaurants in Kendall Square to a corner grocery store, which is now operating as Vincent’s Corner Grocery. Charles, the owner of Rock City Pizza in Allston, said he converted a “late night window” into a “curbside pickup window,” which many customers gravitated to.
Maher, the Cambridge Chamber of Commerce president, discussed the organization’s pivot to becoming a source of information and an advocate for small businesses.
“We have to do more. We have to be able to respond,” Maher said. “In Cambridge, there was an extraordinary response to that, just looking at the reduction in fees that the city came up with in 2021, which were 40 percent reduction in fees for liquor [licenses] and in permitting.”
Maher said he hopes to see the city help small business owners “maneuver and jump through all the hoops” of starting a business like licensing, inspections, plumbing, and more.
In an interview after the panel discussion, McDonough, the Brighton Main Streets director, said many businesses in his area have expressed concerns about rent.
“If there was a wish that I could have granted, it would just be to be able to provide that kind of funding, so that many of our businesses could get ahead of their rent, because while they’re not paying it, it’s still accruing, and it has to get paid somehow,” he said.
McDonough said he expects businesses to continue “exploring” the innovation and creativity they have fostered during the pandemic.
“One thing I would want to leave is just this notion of the ‘new normal’ and what it will look like, and really exploring these waves of innovation and creativity to make sure businesses can always stay afloat and have solutions already put into place that they may not be aware of,” he said.

A group of researchers from around the world, including two Harvard Medical School affiliates, discovered a new cellular function that explains how teeth sense cold temperatures and why that causes tooth pain.
The team published a paper titled “Odontoblast TRPC5 channels signal cold pain in teeth” in the journal Science Advances on March 26 that revealed a novel function for odontoblast cells in the tooth. According to the researchers, these findings are an important breakthrough from a basic science standpoint and can be applied to help relieve cold-induced pain in patients.
The two Medical School affiliates who worked on the study are Professor of Cardiovascular Research emeritus David E. Clapham and Associate Professor of Pathology Jochen K. Lennerz.
Katharina Zimmermann, a co-author of the paper and researcher at Friedrich Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany who specializes in the study of pain, explained how enamel and dentin — outer layers of the tooth that work in tandem to protect the inner layers that contain blood vessels and nerve cells — are some of the most important structural components in teeth.
Researchers previously believed tooth pain was caused by the expansion and contraction of a fluid inside the dentin shell. This theory argued that the movement of the fluid pressed on nerve endings situated near the shell.
“The problem is that there has never been a model, either a biomechanical or another experimental model, that would have allowed to measure any of these mechanical forces that were postulated,” Zimmermann said.
Lennerz, who also serves as medical director at Center for Integrated Diagnostics at Massachusetts General Hospital, discovered that a protein named TRPC5 — which the team predicted played a role in cold sensing — was actually present in large quantities in nerve cells in teeth. After stimulating pain receptors in mice teeth and gathering signals from those nerve cells, they found TRPC5 in large amounts in odontoblasts.
The findings suggested TRPC5 is actually active in the odontoblasts, rather than in the nerves as previously thought.
A possible application of the study’s findings could be alleviating pain for individuals with hypersensitive teeth. Oil of cloves, otherwise known as eugenol, has long been used to treat tooth pain caused by cold temperatures. Until now, however, nobody understood why.
Lennerz explained eugenol works by inhibiting TRPC5 currents and disrupting the cold transduction pathways.
In addition to expanding product lines that use eugenol, understanding these mechanisms makes it easier to develop solutions to other related problems that are ripe areas for future research, according to Lennerz.
“It clarifies this ancient myth about what causes that pain,” he said. “I think it illustrates that this pain, this suffering related to a tooth has been a long standing problem and any puzzle piece to add to our understanding of that is, at least to me, super exciting.”

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation to establish an information week about services at Harvard University Health Services and to release a statement on addressing sexual harassment at the University on Sunday.
The information week, titled “HUHS N’ U,” will teach students about the student health fee and the insurance services provided by HUHS.
“There is a general lack of knowledge on what is and is not covered under the student health fee and/or HUHS health insurance,” the legislation reads. “Harvard has an obligation to ensure and oversee the health and wellbeing of its students, faculty, staff, and associates.”
The educational programming will begin on Sunday, April 25 and will run through Friday, April 30.
The legislation, which was sponsored by Elm Yard Representative Anant P. Rajan ’24 and Crimson Yard Representative Jane J. Oh ’24, passed unanimously.
The Council also passed legislation endorsing a statement supporting survivors of sexual assault on campus and around the world.
“The threat of being sexually harassed and assaulted on Harvard’s campus is real and imminent,” the legislation reads. “It is all too common for our own undergraduate population to feel scared to walk around campus by themselves out of fear of being harassed.”
The statement cites a survey of Harvard students suggesting the rate of sexual violence on campus is “largely unchanged” since 2015.
“We are deeply outraged that, after four years, the levels of campus sexual violence remains largely unchanged since 2015,” the statement reads. “We must do more, together, to find ways to prevent sexual harassment and assault from occurring in the first place.”
The statement professes allyship with survivors of sexual harassment, and demands that Harvard make “geniune systemic change” in its culture.
The statement also lists the demands of Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student organization opposing sexual violence, and provides resources for those experiencing sexual violence.
The legislation was inspired by an effort to raise awareness of sexual and gender-based violence following the sexual assault and killing of Sarah Everard, a young woman in London. A police officer has been charged with murder in her death.
The legislation to release the statement, sponsored by Mather House Representative Yousuf Bakshi ’23, Ivy Yard Representative Tarina K. Ahuja ’24, Adams House Representative Jordan H. Barton ’23, and Crimson Yard Representative Shreya P. Nair ’24, passed by a vote of 43-0-0.

A team of astronomers, including Harvard affiliates, have captured the first-ever image of a black hole’s polarized emission — which offers insight into its magnetic fields — according to an article published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in late March.
The Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, an international collaboration of astronomers focused on understanding black holes and their environments, also captured the first-ever image of a black hole in 2019. Members of Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative and Center for Astrophysics are part of the collaboration.
The most recent historic discovery captured the polarization images of the supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy.
The data collected for this research came from telescopes strategically placed in locations across the globe, including in Hawaii, Mexico, and the South Pole — which work together to “turn the Earth into a collecting dish,” said Richard J. Anantua, a postdoctoral fellow at the Black Hole Initiative and the CfA.
Maciek S. Wielgus, a postdoctoral fellow at the Black Hole Initiative and the CfA, said the EHT observations revealed the “amount of linear polarization and orientation of the polarization vector.” From these observations, the team was able to learn more about the magnetic field of the black hole.
“The magnetic field lines are expected to be perpendicular to these polarization vector structures that we see,” he said. “We can use different models — theoretical models — to figure out what is the geometry of the magnetic field and what is the strength of this magnetic field.”
The study primarily concludes that the M87 black hole looks like it has “strong magnetic fields near the event horizon,” said Daniel C. M. Palumbo, an Astronomy Ph.D. candidate at Harvard and an EHT collaborator.
“It’s not matter dragging magnetic fields around — it’s the magnetic field telling matter how to behave,” Wielgus added.
Being able to understand magnetic fields “anywhere in space,” let alone surrounding a black hole, is very difficult, according to Palumbo. As a result, the EHT collaboration’s success in capturing the polarized emissions is a major milestone in the field of astrophysics.
In April 2019, the EHT published the total intensity data of the M87 black hole and the first-ever image of a black hole from this data.
“With these first results about total intensity, when we didn’t care at all about ‘is it polarized or not,’ we just cared about the total amount of energy,” Wielgus said.
During the two years from then until now, the team focused on calibrating the data to learn about the black hole’s polarization, with the end goal of understanding its magnetic fields, he added.
Wielgus said the polarization image and the accompanying research was made possible largely due to the advancement of technology in recent years. He added that there is “no chance” this accomplishment could have occurred a decade ago.
“We really need to record a lot of data,” Wielgus said. “All the way to, currently, 64 gigabits per second — 64 gigabits means every second you get an eight gigabyte of data just being greeted into your hard drive. This requires electronics that were just not available.”
This scientific feat was achieved despite the ongoing challenges presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.
“We are doing data analysis and we need really frequent communication,” said Kazunori Akiyama, an MIT astrophysicist affiliated with Harvard’s Black Hole Initiative. “This pandemic doesn’t allow people to discuss something in the same place, so that was also a kind of logistical challenge.”
Palumbo recounted the “heart-pounding moment” when results first came out of the imaging process and he was “peering directly at the shadow of a black hole.”
“This is a thing that looks kind of like a donut, and there’s a black hole in the middle and we’re looking at it — it seems like you’re seeing something forbidden,” he said. “So that magic sort of carries through.”
As for the research group’s future goals, Akiyama said that the EHT will not be stopping here.
“This is just only the beginning — so we will see much more beautiful images and the fantastic nature of the black hole over the next several years,” he said.

Administrators at the Dean of Students Office discussed their planning for a virtual iteration of the College’s admitted students’ weekend — Visitas — and potential College-sponsored outdoor activities in an interview last week.
Typically, Visitas spans across a weekend in April and welcomes hundreds of admitted students to stay on campus, attend events held by on-campus organizations, and learn about student life at Harvard.
Last year, the College canceled Visitas due to concerns of the Covid-19 pandemic and replaced it with Virtual Visitas, a series of online events and programming that took place over the month of April. This year, the remote version of Visitas is slated to take place from April 17 to April 23.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said the DSO is “so excited” to welcome admitted students at Visitas.
“We are so excited for the opportunity to welcome the class of 2025 and to really encourage them to come here to this wonderful place,” O’Dair said.
Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 said that the DSO, in collaboration with the Admissions Office and First-Year Experience Office, is brainstorming ways to deliver “information about what Harvard looks like” to prospective students.
“Traditionally, Visitas is the time when the Admissions Office and the FYE and the DSO work very closely together,” Brandt said. “So there’s been a lot of conversations going on about how best to provide the potential to the Class of 2025, with the information about what Harvard looks like, both in terms of the opportunities that it offers and also just the experience of being a Harvard College student.”
Kate T. Colleran, assistant dean of Student Engagement and Leadership, added that the virtual Visitas will feature several student organizations as usual.
“The student orgs have just been really excited to recruit in this virtual space because it is their chance to meet the students,” Colleran said. “There will be a Virtual Involvement Fair and then individual student org events throughout the week.”
Some events, including the Virtual Involvement Fair, will be hosted on the College’s Hub platform, Colleran said.
Separate from Visitas, DSO administrators said there is a possibility for some outdoor programming for students living in residence this semester after the College’s shift to “Level 4: Lime” of its campus reopening plan on March 1.
“We’ve got an outdoor program we’re putting on before the end of classes at the end of April. It’s called Lucidity,” Colleran explained. “It’s basically this really cool outdoor reflective light show that you walk through. We’ll have it set up in the Yard.”
The event will be exclusive to students on campus with an option for off-campus students to participate virtually, Colleran added.
“There’s been a yoga class that we partnered with the Athletics Office to take place in the Yard,” Brandt said. “There’s a couple smaller, House-based activities that are being planned.”
“We have started to plan a few things but we’re always looking for ways to kind of hear about what people are looking for,” Brandt added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard researchers have identified a mechanism explaining how chronic stress may lead to hair loss, according to a study published in Nature last month.
Researchers at Harvard, MIT, Massachusetts General Hospital, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, and University Hospital Würzburg in Germany collaborated on the study, which was helmed by Ya-Chieh Hsu, a biology professor at Harvard and faculty member at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute.
The study found the stress hormone corticosterone inhibited hair follicle stem cell activity and hair growth in mice. The researchers reported that when corticosterone levels were low in mice, their hair follicle stem cells regenerated much more frequently. However, when corticosterone levels were high due to chronic stress, the hair follicles entered a dormant phase.
Hsu’s lab primarily focuses on the impact of stress on stem cells and tissues. Last year, her lab identified a mechanism connecting stress and hair-graying: the depletion of melanocyte stem cells, which are responsible for hair’s color.
“In this new [study], we identified a completely different mechanism by which stress affects hair follicle stem cells—the stem cells important for regulating hair follicle regeneration and hair growth,” Hsu wrote in an email. “We found that chronic stress, through up-regulation of the stress hormone corticosterone (the mouse equivalent of the human stress hormone cortisol), inhibits an activation signal (Gas6) in dermal cells surrounding hair follicle stem cells that normally promotes stem cell activation and hair growth.”
“The mechanisms with which stress can trigger tissue changes can be diverse, and there is still a lot to be learned,” she added.
Matthias Nahrendorf, a professor of radiology at Massachusetts General Hospital and a member of Hsu’s research team, brought his expertise from a study of psychosocial stress and cardiovascular disease in mice.
“She got in touch with me and wanted to learn about how we stress mice, because it's not trivial and there's a lot of different models out there on how to do that,” he said.
Hsu’s study protocol involved feeding mice corticosterone, in addition to exposing them to various stressors like isolation, crowding, damp bedding, sudden changes in light, restraining, and more, according to the paper’s methods section.
The researchers noted that they are interested in ultimately testing these findings beyond mice.
“It’s a very common problem,” Nahrendorf said of research done on mice. “We do a lot of studies on mice, but the question then is, how does it actually translate to people?”
He noted that the “major components” of stress systems in mice and humans are “fairly similar,” though “you don’t really know until you’ve tested it.”
Hsu wrote that the lab hopes to investigate whether these observations hold up in human models of stress.
“We are interested in exploring this stress hormone-Gas6 connection in human skin to see if the mechanisms we identified in mice are conserved,” she wrote.

On March 15, Columbia’s graduate student union began a three-week strike. Three days later, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers met with University officials in their first bargaining session for a second contract. The following week, New York University’s graduate student union began voting to authorize a strike amid negotiations for its third contract — and on April 9, it voted 96.4 percent in favor.
Joe Biden’s ascension to the White House has precipitated a flurry of activity by graduate student unions at private universities across the country, some of whom had avoided certain organizing efforts during the Trump administration amid fears that their cases would be used to shut down graduate students’ right to unionize altogether.
Graduate students at private universities secured the right to unionize with the National Labor Relations Board’s historic Columbia University ruling in 2016. Eight graduate student unions now have at least one contract on the books — with seven out of those eight agreements coming after the Columbia decision.
Once again, Columbia has been at the forefront of graduate student organizing in recent months. After more than two years of negotiations with Columbia administrators, the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Automobile Workers went on strike over five contract proposals: third-party arbitration for discrimination and harassment cases, wage and stipend increases, recognition of undergraduates and Master’s degree candidates, healthcare benefits, and its demand for a union shop, which stipulates that employees must join the union and pay dues after starting work. Nationwide, graduate student unions — including Harvard’s — are campaigning for many of these same demands for their own members.
Alongside Columbia students at the picket line in New York City were graduate student workers from HGSU-UAW, NYU’s Graduate Student Organizing Committee-United Automobile Workers, and Brown University’s Graduate Labor Organization. Columbia’s union hosted virtual picketing sessions for supporters to picket from afar, and a number of graduate student unions reposted GWC-UAW content on Twitter and Facebook.
“Columbia is very much leading the way in terms of graduate student unionization,” GWC-UAW organizer Amogh B. Sahu said. “We’ve faced and overcome significant challenges concerning strike organizing in the pandemic situation.”
In the second week of the strike, Ira I. Katznelson, Columbia’s interim provost, sent an email to students, faculty, and staff announcing the university’s proposal for an amended appeals process for cases of harassment and discrimination. Katznelson proposed that a panel of people in “higher education and/or employment law” who are not affiliated with the university hear cases “on a rotating basis.” A group of representatives from “various constituencies,” including GWC-UAW, would help choose the panelists.
On April 3, GWC-UAW’s bargaining committee voted 7-3 to pause the strike and enter mediation with Columbia. According to Sahu, individual graduate departments are still on strike.
“We very much hope that we’re able to ultimately put on the table a strong contract which is precedent-setting for a number of peer institutions,” Sahu said. “Graduate student organizing is in some ways still in its infancy and much remains to be done.”
According to labor law experts, the Biden administration has already shown it will be friendlier than its predecessor to organized labor, particularly to graduate student organization. The NLRB, a quasi-judicial federal agency headed by a five-member board and a General Counsel who oversee labor practices, is increasingly pro-labor as Biden appoints new members.
In September 2019, the majority Trump-appointed NLRB proposed an unprecedented rule that would have disqualified graduate students as “employees” under the National Labor Relations Act of 1935. The rule, if enacted, would have barred graduate students from unionizing and effectively reversed the 2016 Columbia decision.
The proposed rule was withdrawn on March 15 “in light of competing agency priorities.” Biden has already fired the Trump-appointed General Counsel, replaced the Board’s chair with an Obama appointee, and will likely nominate two new members later this year, giving the NLRB a pro-labor majority if they are confirmed by the Senate.
William A. Herbert, executive director of the National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions at Hunter College, City University of New York, said he expects a majority Biden-appointed NLRB will encourage more graduate students to unionize.
“It is probable that, once there is a new majority on the NLRB, they will see an increase in the filing of representation petitions involving graduate assistants at private universities and colleges,” Herbert said.
In order to form a union, graduate students have to either win voluntary recognition from their university or certification from the NLRB. For the latter, once 30 percent of the student workers petition to create a union, the NLRB will hold an election. If the majority votes to unionize, the NLRB certifies the union.
Twelve graduate student unions at private universities have been certified, but four of those don’t have their first contract yet.
Dennis M. Hogan, political director of GLO at Brown University, said the Biden-appointed NLRB will be welcomed by graduate student organizers, but it isn’t a cure-all.
“Every time the [administration] changes, there’s this groundswell of organizing and people are excited to unionize,” he said. “Then a Republican gets elected and then it all goes dormant. Then another eight years pass and it comes back.”
Even so, Hogan said he thinks the national climate is fundamentally changing, giving graduate students more leverage.
“I think what’s different this time around is that it’s happening within the context of a national revival of union activism, so it’s not just that this small group of workers which are graduate students have a decision made about their right to organize,” Hogan added. “Instead, across the country workers everywhere are seeking this kind of power and this kind of representation.”
One reflection of this shift is renewed legislative efforts to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which encourages unionization. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 9; if it survives the Senate, it will be “the biggest change in American labor law since 1947,” according to Herbert.
Herbert also emphasized that changes at the local and state level could have dramatic effects on the national labor movement. He added that, while past Democratic administrations have tried to pass comprehensive labor law reform, Biden is prioritizing the labor movement, including championing the PRO Act.
“What President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden have been saying about unionization is unprecedented in my lifetime,” Herbert said.
Former NLRB Chairman William B. Gould IV noted, however, that it is unlikely the bill will pass without significant edits.
Change isn’t just coming from governments: Pew Research Center polls have shown that the American public favors unions, and has for the better part of 30 years. Herbert also called the outpouring of support for the Columbia graduate student strike and the Amazon union vote in Bessemer, Ala., manifestations of broader pro-labor sentiment sparked by growing awareness of income inequality, job insecurity, and power imbalances in the workplace.
“There’s no question that [the] kind of support that the graduate assistants at Columbia received, as well as the level of support that is being shown for the Amazon workers — demonstrations in different cities across the country on behalf of the Amazon workers — is all very indicative of a sea change about labor and about labor rights,” he said.
The real question, Herbert concluded, is how universities will respond to graduate students’ renewed petitions and the increasing support for union organizing from local governments, activists, and other unions.
Gould said he expects private universities to continue resisting unionization efforts. While they are exposed to pro-labor pressure from the public, students, and even politicians, Gould said “universities are businesses.”
“Many of them are likely to fight [the graduate student organizers] just as ferociously as they have done already,” he said.
NYU’s pioneering graduate union has ratified two contracts already, but organizer Ellis E. Garey said the union’s organizing relies on the success and failures of similar unions.
In particular, she said GSOC-UAW members — especially those like herself who haven’t yet participated in a strike — can learn from the graduate student worker strike at Columbia as the NYU union prepares for next steps following its strike authorization.
“Learning from the Columbia experience that students have been overwhelmingly supportive of graduate workers who have chosen to go on strike has given confidence to many teachers at NYU to begin having conversations with their students about what the implications of a strike would be for them,” she said.
Academia more broadly is a small world, said Hogan, the GLO political director at Brown.
“I would say the grad labor movement is tightly-knit in that way,” he said. “Many of these conversations happen informally. It’s like, I have a friend at Yale and I’ll reach out to them or I know somebody who is involved with the union at Harvard, so I’ll talk to them.”
As more unions win recognition and first contracts, Hogan said he anticipates those connections will become more institutionalized. Right now, he said, GLO is closest to the Georgetown Alliance of Graduate Employees because the two unions are under the same parent organization, the American Federation of Teachers, and they have had the most similar trajectories — both unions ratified their first contracts last year.
Dominick Cooper, the lead organizer for humanities and languages at GAGE, said remote organizing has made inter-union conversations more accessible. He said virtual discussions and panels have also allowed him to see the differences in circumstances between graduate unions.
Graduate student organizers who are still working towards official recognition for their unions noted that successful contract agreements and Columbia strike — as well as one at Harvard in December 2019 — provide guidance. Nathan K. Ellstrand, an organizer at Loyola Graduate Workers’ Union at Loyola University Chicago, pointed to the example set by Columbia’s 2016 recognition and GAGE, which, like LGWU, is a graduate student union at a Jesuit institution.
While GAGE has gained voluntary recognition from its university, LGWU has yet to do so. On Oct. 17, 2017, Loyola denied LGWU recognition, arguing that graduate students are not “employees” under the NLRA. Ellstrand said he is wary of a Jesuit university like Loyola arguing that its graduate student workers would be classified as religious workers, barring them from unionization.
“[GAGE] sets precedent that there can be a grad worker union at a Jesuit university, and that really is exciting,” Ellstrand said.
Brendan D. Mahoney, an organizer for Graduate Employees Together-University of Pennsylvania, praised the determination of Columbia’s union.
“They’ve also been a role model in just how dedicated and organized and effective they are,” he said. “I think that we’ve learned a lot.”
Sarah J. Reibstein, a Princeton Graduate Student United organizer, also noted that PGSU was following the Columbia strike closely, as she foresaw PGSU running into similar problems as GWC-UAW in getting Princeton to “meaningfully bargain.”
Both Mahoney and Reibstein said their unions circulated the GoFundMe for GWC-UAW’s strike hardship fund and news about digital and in-person picketing at Columbia. More broadly, graduate student organizers emphasized the interdependence of the graduate student movement.
Elisa Purschke, another PGSU organizer, added that graduate students have been circulating resources and coordinating tactics for years, and this has only picked up during the pandemic. For example, on May Day last year, graduate students at more than 75 public and private universities, including Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, protested austerity measures in higher education.
Part of that solidarity, Mahoney said, comes from the fact that graduate student unions are a legally and economically precarious category — nowhere in federal law are graduate students explicitly given the right to unionize.
“We can really see tangibly how our success or failure is tied together,” he said. “We’re all doing a similar job for universities and we’re exploited in similar ways, and that goes beyond the student bodies at any individual school.”

It’s the start of a new semester and you’re skimming through syllabi for potential courses. In your endless skimming, you come across the classic weekly discussion post as an assignment. Now, there are one of two thoughts that could be going through your mind: one, I have found the perfect class. This is it. Or two: Absolutely. Not. While it could be valid to think that discussion posts are a waste of time, there are many reasons to prove otherwise. Will you still be Team Hate It after reading the reasons to Love It?
Love It – Anna M. Peters
Whether the course is a concentration requirement or a Gened, discussion posts are, by far, one of the best grade boosters. Most of the time they are couple-hundred-word reflections on the readings. Does this mean that you will have to do the readings? Not at all. Choose a specific part of the reading and go on a little rant. Just think of it as your weekly rant or debrief to your friends, but with a different topic. Or, if you’ve already gotten your storytime for the week, just think of how to say “that’s a great point!” or “this was very insightful,” in 5-7 different ways to fill up the word count. Here are some starters: “I was surprised by this…”, “The concepts discussed in the readings pose an interesting perspective…”, etc. So many options.
Plus, it’s not actually thaaat deep. How many discussion post responses are you really reading yourself? Except for the few to get a feel for the general vibe or to provide a mandatory response to someone else’s, there probably aren’t many, if not zero. Many other people are most likely doing the same. Discussion posts are supposed to be pretty quick, so rest assured that no one will be spending their Sunday morning sipping on coffee closely reading through the thread of posts. Now, when you see a discussion post assignment, you should be filled with joy. Go write that post and get that A.
Hate It – Nicole T. Rozelman
Nobody agrees more than students writing a discussion post. While this may sound like a good thing, it doesn’t really facilitate the kind of critical discourse professors are hoping for. Expanding on Anna’s point (see how I said that without actually engaging with what she said), this assignment type usually feels more like busy work than an opportunity to show what you’ve learned. Writing one of these responses every week means you won’t have the energy to do anything beyond pulling a quote from the one reading you actually paid attention to and maybe ending with a broad, existential question if you're feeling extra. Although don’t expect for that question to ever be answered; it’s not like your classmates will even read it.
A lot of the time, that’s not their fault. In a 300-person Gen Ed, you can’t help that the interesting points will get lost in a barrage of Slack notifications that you quickly set to “do not disturb.” The interaction that professors are hoping to get out of discussion threads would be better facilitated in section, where students can speak to each other in small groups face-to-face (screen-to-screen?). Perhaps a more effective alternative to stringing together 250 words worth of transitions and buzz words would be preparing a few bullet points that you could potentially bring up in class on a shared section Google doc. This more focused and personal format would provide the same evidence of your engagement with the readings, and serve as an organized and productive jumping-off point for class.
To end my discussion, I agree with my classmates’ above points but would like to extend their thinking with the opinion that phasing out discussion posts would be an engaging and effective contribution to students’ academic experiences, as the readings supported. ;)

Before Jill E. Abramson ’76 sat at the helm of The New York Times and Amy Wilentz ’76 embedded herself within post-Duvalier Haiti, the two’s college misadventures were the subject of a Commencement feature in The Harvard Crimson.
These decorated journalists were Mather House roommates and kicked off their reporting careers as undergraduates — Wilentz for The Crimson and Abramson as a theatre critic for The Harvard Independent. They were part of the first cohort of women to live in Harvard Yard.
Filmed October 2, 2020. Hosted by Andrew W. Liang and Samuel W. Zwickel. Edited by Ryan N. Gajarawala.
