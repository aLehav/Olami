After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
‘Twas the day before The Game, and I, as well as thousands of other Harvard students, sit in excitement, waiting to make the trek down to Yale for an event heralded as one of the “defining moments” of the classic Harvard experience. But, unlike the average student, my excitement for The Game does not stem from my hatred of Yale or some deep-seated school pride — no, it stems from my weird (and very newfound) belief that football exemplifies the dichotomy of social change.
I do not think the average American understands Texas’s love (or borderline problematic obsession) with football. In fact, I don’t even think Texans understand our own obsession with football until we venture outside our state. Just miles from my own home, a $70 million high school football stadium was built a couple of years ago, and eight out of the nine largest high school stadiums in the United States are in Texas — and not a single Texan will bat an eye in reading those statistics. Other states may enjoy professional football and encourage their children to play while growing up, but only in Texas does a single sport have such a chokehold on the local community.
“Friday Night Lights” is known to many as a popular television show that delves into a world of football, community, and life; but in Texas, this phrase leaps out of the pages of the screenplay and, emulating the spirit of the production, perfectly encapsulates the ability of Texas football to bring together people that would not usually be together. Stories and perspectives collide in the grill-saturated air of a tailgate as blinding fluorescent lights illuminate the field the moment the sun sets on a Friday night. Texas football is a microcosm of a messy and beautiful life, bringing a community together in the spirit of celebration and fellowship.
Football looks a lot different at Harvard. For one, attendance to games (and even the desire to attend) is minimal at best — the average Harvard student probably cannot even recall when the last football game was. This is no fault of the football team, who have had a great season so far. Rather, the fault lies in the fact that community is found elsewhere; football is not a dominating social force like it is in Texas. But, football at Harvard does manage to embody something else — a spirit of protest.
In 2019, at the latest Harvard-Yale game either school has seen, hundreds of protestors stormed Yale’s field a little before halftime, demanding Harvard and Yale “divest their endowments from fossil fuels and Puerto Rican debt.” Football was being used as a tool of social change, of student activism, giving students a platform to call out both Harvard and Yale on their fiduciary role in furthering these two problematic agendas.
To many, these two pictures of football could not seem more different from each other — one is known for its community, and the other is celebrated for its radical spirit. But held in these two images is the spectrum of social change.
Texas football brings together people from all different walks of life. Here, listening, friendship, and fellowship abound. Harvard football, on the other hand, is a stage for protest. Here, unjust systems and institutions are confronted by passionate student activists. While, of course, this is a very simplistic and romanticized understanding of football, an important revelation arises.
Texas football represents the “listening” aspect of change — in order to understand what in a system needs to change, one must listen to those that are affected. Harvard football represents the “active” aspect of change — armed with the knowledge of what needs to be changed, action can then ensue.
Change is only fulfilled and sustained when both are present: when listening is done for the sake of listening and your narrative, or that of another, drives one towards action against a system. Together, Texas and Harvard football exemplify the two extremes of social change. Change requires a marriage of the two, for just listening to a person and refusing to act leads to stagnation, but just attacking a system without the grounding direction of those who are affected leads to performative activism.
Social activism and social change are defined too narrowly at Harvard. Here, we only play “Harvard football.” Change and activism only count if they are in a “registrable” form — they must be something tangible, something you can put on a resume or brag about in an under-the-radar way to your Gov 20 class. We have not yet legitimized the value of activism and change in the form of “Texas football.” No one can put conversations on the sidelines of a Texas high school football game on their resume, nor should they. They’re not an achievement but a standard of respect and love; still, these conversations are a vehicle for social change nonetheless, and one that does not deserve sidelining in social change discourse. Texas football is just as important as Harvard football.
And so, as the great Game approaches, I implore you to infuse a bit of that Texas football spirit into Harvard; change, to be sustainable, requires both.

“He that idly loses five shillings’ worth of time, loses five shillings, and might as prudently throw five shillings into the sea.” — Benjamin Franklin
At the beginning of the 20th century, German sociologist Max Weber analyzed the emptiness of America’s economic philosophy with an eerie prophetic prowess. His theory on the spirit of capitalism hearkens back to the Puritans in the American colonies of the 17th century, who were seeking God’s calling over their lives. To assure themselves salvation, they developed a sort of capitalistic co-opted theology, asserting that hard work — and the wealth it accrued — would present evidence of “rebirth and genuine faith.” At the same time as they garnered wealth, they practiced asceticism to portray their commitment to God. The Puritans worked day in and day out to garner and save money, yet lived lowly lives, only keeping the money as symbolic of God’s favor.
As time progressed and America was founded, this ethical ideology lost its religious root. Take Benjamin Franklin’s words above. In essence, time is money, it suggests. You lose the former, you lose the latter. This is the “spirit” of capitalism: an American, Harvardian ethic that idolizes work as a calling, an end in itself. But what happens when what was once morally good becomes utilitarian?
“The Puritan wanted to work in a calling: we are forced to do so,” says Weber. We lock ourselves in an “iron cage,” enslaved to an ideology of work, achievement, and materialism.
This reality presents a pandemic on Harvard’s campus. In July of 2020, Harvard’s Report of the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health noted rising student depression and anxiety disorders. Moreover, students’ extracurriculars largely contributed — rather than eased — student stress.
But we students don’t need the statistics. It’s evident everywhere: in classrooms, at final clubs’ parties, in the absurd comping process for extracurriculars. I remember my first midterm season at Harvard, struggling through an incessant flood of schoolwork. I remember confusion in Math 1a — despite attending all the office hours — and my inability to find and keep a friend, someone to study with, because I also had a couple of papers (and hundreds of pages to read) within the next week.
After coming from a completely different high school experience, I didn’t have anyone to tell me not to do all the work. To tell me to prioritize my health, to show me how to navigate the college system. I stopped exercising and sleeping regularly, concerned about career-building. I remember walking through the Yard, my head down in stress, overwhelmed by a culture in which everyone seemed to take pride in being overburdened. Everyone was in a hurry, brushing by, hesitant to engage in extemporaneous conversation. Looking back, I believe I fell into a low-grade depression and lost a piece of myself during that time. But hey, I got great grades that semester.
It took a global pandemic, sending me home, for my rest to begin.
The spirit of capitalism is an evil one, and it needs an exorcism. While the University has attempted to ameliorate the situation of its students, the power to change our school’s culture ultimately lay in our — the students’ — hands.
On the institutional level, Harvard has attempted, unsuccessfully, to care for its students’ flourishing. Harvard is full of academic support, boasting in-House tutors and advisors and various career services. At the same time, Counseling and Mental Health Services is overburdened and under-resourced, and — though the University has tried — its attempts to encourage health often fall flat, jokes in the eyes of its students.
Take last year’s ”wellness days”, for example. Instead of spring break, we were offered a set of days spread across the semester on which class was canceled. The problem, however, is that canceling class doesn’t renew our framework for rest. In my circle, wellness days were merely work-all-day-to-catch-up days.
Wellness days were good — they just weren’t radical enough. They should have been shaped — encouraging the participation of administration, faculty, staff, and students alike — around a broader culture of wellness, where deadlines paused and work became more flexible.
To begin eroding the spirit’s control, we students must begin by choosing not to work, at times. If you’ve made it here, you have the work ethic and study habits necessary to succeed and find some rest in-between, even if that means you don’t end up valedictorian. Just do you. And rest too.
So let’s stretch the College’s wellness programming — school spirit events, like Harvard-Yale, or House-wide outing events, ping-pong tournaments, and intramural sports — for all they’re worth. Moreover, let’s demand an end to the ideological competitiveness that so deeply entrenches us in false performance. It’s time we demand finals clubs stop punching based on cuteness and that rigorous comping processes (Harvard tryouts, post-Harvard-acceptance) cease.
To overthrow capitalism’s spirit on our campus, we must look within ourselves and find the spiritual prowess to walk and not run, to breath in the fresh air around us, to see clearly again.

Austin just got a new university — on paper, at least. The University of Austin, or UATX for short, will open its doors next summer. Though it will not yet confer degrees, UATX aims to offer an alternative to what its supporters perceive as the “the illiberalism and censoriousness prevalent in America's most prestigious universities”.
It’s worth prefacing our view on UATX’s founding with the caveat that we struggle to take the project seriously at all. It is, after all, a not-yet-accredited institution that has been bleeding supporters since week one; one that explains its Austin location with the unwittingly self-deprecating concession that “if it's good enough for Elon Musk and Joe Rogan” it's apparently good enough for the University too.
Setting aside this bizarre posturing, we are concerned about the seriousness of the project and the implications that has for those who become entangled in it. Prioritizing a flashy launch over even the most basic university-building signals the founders’ focus on grandstanding over actual education; the apparent lack of legitimate accreditations or an internal admissions committee is an alarming sign of under-preparedness. We are worried, in short, that UATX will end up scamming its students.
Beyond the obvious execution and organizational issues, we are deeply doubtful of the sincerity of the project’s stated goals. We agree there’s potential value in shaking up the American higher education scene, and have repeatedly written in support of broad, sensible free speech guidelines. Yet we are skeptical that those involved in the university’s conception are staunch, honest allies of either cause.
UATX’s rollout hasn’t seemed to have much to do with identifying and resisting censorship in American society. Doing so would mean wrestling with actual legislative restrictions on free speech, like the dozens of state-level anti-BDS bills that punish companies that participate in the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement; or the increasing number of states, including UATX’s native Texas that ban the teaching of anything that mildly resembles the boogeyman of “critical race theory” (Texas’s bill has put teachers in the ludicrous position of having to teach an “opposing” perspective of the Holocaust). It would mean embracing banned texts, like the Pulitzer prize-winning 1619 project, in their inaugural Forbidden Courses program, instead of (as seems likely) taking the intellectually shallow route of only teaching the controversial work they favor. It would entail actually confronting the main forces behind creeping American authoritarianism, arguably the same ones that led to a violent attack on our nation’s capital earlier this year, or fighting against innovative approaches to intimidate academics, like Florida’s Public Universities’ new “viewpoint diversity” survey, which will assess, and potentially penalize, schools based on the views represented on their campus.
Instead, UATX is sharply focused on the presumed “censorship” taking place within a handful of elite institutions. Their thinly veiled commitment to litigating cultural grievances is only made more glaringly by their almost boastful opposition to affirmative action, a policy they condemn and discard on their website lacking many other basic details.
Let’s be blunt: At its core, UATX doesn’t seem to care about free speech. Rather, it represents a twisted attempt by a select group of aggrieved people to force their orthodoxy onto others through sheer spectacle. A look at the organization’s leadership suggests as much. There’s Bari Weiss, a founding trustee and former New York Times writer who first rose to prominence for allegedly seeking to “vilify and ruin the careers of several Arab and Muslim professors” for criticism of Israel while a student at Columbia University. There’s former Harvard President Lawrence H. Summers, whose declaration that women are just more inept in the sciences than men and farcical advocacy for dumping toxic waste in poor countries got him in hot water during his brief presidential tenure. Niall Fergusson, a Stanford historian perhaps fired for blatantly trying to dig up dirt on a progressive undergraduate, is also in the unsavory mix.
Their collective blindspots are as astonishing as concerning. More crucially, their commitment to the first amendment appears secondary to their commitment to petty, pseudo ideological infighting. We are concerned their reactionary, selective promotion of free speech will inform the university’s curriculum.
Free speech is a cornerstone of liberal education, democracy, and civil society. It is a deeply held value we cherish as a journalistic institution. It is not, however, a cheap marketing ploy to be hollowly used to court support and controversy. Should an institution genuinely committed to promoting free speech appear in the future, we would welcome it with open arms. But the circus forming in Austin leaves us holding our breath.

Harvard will host a joint Commencement ceremony for its last two graduating classes this spring, allowing the Classes of 2020 and 2021 to celebrate graduation in person after their exercises were postponed due to the pandemic.
The University will hold the event on the morning of May 29, 2022, with a University-wide gathering in Tercentenary Theatre and programs by each of Harvard’s 12 schools. Both classes will celebrate together in joint ceremonies.
The event will come just three days following the Class of 2022’s Commencement exercises, which are set for May 26.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow wrote to affiliates Thursday afternoon that the event will mark “the conclusion of what has been an extraordinarily trying time for all of us with an affirmation of our community’s strength and spirit.”
“I am looking forward to giving you a proper send-off from the heart of Harvard Yard,” Bacow wrote. “Nothing can replace the energy and excitement of being together, and I hope you and your loved ones will be able to join us for what we hope will be a once-in-a-generation event.”
Harvard held virtual graduation ceremonies for the Classes of 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, pledging to eventually hold an in-person Commencement. Bacow said in a March interview he hoped to make the event with “as much pomp and circumstance”  as traditional exercises.
Members of the Classes of 2020 and 2021 who require assistance with travel costs to campus can apply for financial aid from the University upon registration for the ceremony, which opens in early 2022.
The University will also offer on-campus accommodations at no charge for graduates returning for the event, subject to availability.
“​​We will endeavor to house all those graduates who request it, but we will be limited by availability and will be unable to guarantee specific locations,” the school’s Commencement website reads.
The University is also working to negotiate group rates at hotels in the area.
All graduates and their guests attending the Commencement Exercises must be fully vaccinated and follow on-campus Covid-19 protocols.
The joint ceremony will be followed by select Harvard and Radcliffe College reunions in person throughout the first week of June. This spring marks the first time class reunions and the annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association will occur in person since 2019.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of their inauguration in January 2022, recently-elected Cambridge City Council members said in interviews that their priorities include addressing climate change and tackling inequity in the city.
The nine councilors — who include seven incumbents and two challengers who won the election earlier this month — will take office in January of next year and serve for a term of two years.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan said climate change and policies like the Green New Deal Zoning petition will remain two of his priorities during the next term. The petition proposed by Zondervan would charge new buildings a fee depending on their lifetime emissions. Part of the money collected will fund green new job training programs, particularly for low income and minority populations.
Burhan Azeem — the youngest candidate and a challenger who won a seat on the council in this year’s election — said housing is an issue “very close to [his] heart.”
“I grew up with a lot of housing instability,” Azeem said. “I think that ending exclusionary zoning, which has a racist history and keeps Cambridge inaccessible to a lot of people, is the next thing I would like to tackle.”
Azeem also said there are “a lot of opportunities” for housing in the Alewife area to help address the affordable housing crisis.
Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon said the new council has a “tremendous opportunity” to reflect on the lessons learned from the Covid-19 pandemic and use federal relief funds to reform Cambridge.
“We can really divert a lot of our energy, our effort, our intentional policy — alongside funding — to address some of those deep inequities,” Mallon said. “Whether that's universal pre-K or municipal broadband or ensuring that people have access to safe and secure and affordable housing,”
In addition to passing legislation, the newly elected council must select a mayor from among themselves. Cambridge has a council-manager system of government, so voters do not directly elect the mayor. Past mayors still on the council include Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, and current mayor Sumbul Siddiqui.
Several councilors said they have not yet discussed who will be the next mayor and vice mayor.
“It's a little bit early in the process, so I think that as we get closer to inauguration day we'll know more of the details,” Azeem said.
Mallon — the current vice mayor — said she expects the next term’s elected mayor to prioritize helping vulnerable Cambridge residents.
“I will be looking for a mayor that will be driving bold policies and really thinking about the impact that we can make on vulnerable residents and families,” Mallon said. “The bulk of the work that I know I have done and the mayor has done has really been in service to resourcing and supporting the most vulnerable in our community, and that work needs to continue.”
“The policies that we set and the priorities that we make in the next two years are really going to tell us a lot about who we are as a community and I'm excited to be at the table thinking about these policies,” she added.

As the first semester back on campus comes to a close, fellows at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study said they were grateful for an in-person experience after the previous year's fellowship operated remotely.
The Radcliffe Fellowship is an annual program hosted at Harvard that brings “students, scholars, artists, and practitioners together to pursue curiosity-driven research” across the disciplines of science, journalism, music, creative writing, and more. The 50-person program is currently being conducted in-person.
The fellows this year are pursuing a diverse array of projects, ranging from research on mathematical climate modeling to investigative journalism on the subject of political assassination. One fellow, David Dominique, is composing a multimedia opera on political journalism and activism.
Dominique said the in-person format has enabled him to develop fulfilling relationships with his colleagues.
“I would have done it if it were remote, but I think it would have been a very different experience,” he said. “I think some of the relationships that are being formed would just be fundamentally different in nature.”
Elizabeth A. Baker, a current Radcliffe fellow and artist whose creative work focuses on using media to portray “sonic and spatial worlds” that can symbolize philosophies, also said that getting to collaborate face-to-face with other Radcliffe fellows has been a particularly meaningful part of the program.
“I needed to find access to a boat to drop hydrophones [to collect underwater sound],” she said. “It just so happens that one of the fellows — her neighbor is a lobster man and has a boat — so I will be going on the lobster boat to go drop hydrophones for recordings for my project.”
Annalisa Quaini, a current Radcliffe fellow working on mathematical models to predict climate change dynamics, said she is enthusiastic about the opportunity to work and interact with other fellows in such a diverse environment.
“I am enjoying being part of a diverse group of people," she said. “In math, the group of people that you're normally surrounded by is not very diverse; I appreciate that over here.”
Some of the fellows, however, said Harvard’s reopening still poses challenges. Baker said she found readjusting to in-person activities challenging.
“I would say it has been a difficult transition for me and continues to be difficult to transition because, even though I know everyone is tested, everyone has a cold and I'm just like, ‘Oh, I don't know if I can be around you right now,’” she said.
The reopening also did not resolve all of the Covid-19 restrictions placed on in-person research. Journalist and current fellow Suki Kim, whose project requires that she conduct interviews in the field, said that the pandemic continues to pose difficulties to in-person journalism.
“Field reporting has been prevented by Covid,” she said. “It’s not as free and as easy as it was.”
Some fellows said a silver lining of the pandemic was that they found more time to conduct research.
Anthropologist Chidi Ugwu, who delayed his fellowship during the 2020-21 academic year, said that he was able to accomplish “much more writing” on his project during his time at home than would have been possible otherwise.
Rajiv Sethi, a professor at Columbia University who participated in the 2020-21 program, said his typical workflow and collaboration style were disrupted by the pandemic.
But Sethi added he found Zoom and virtual meetings convenient.
“It allowed me some flexibility,” Sethi said. “I could join conversations, even when I was traveling — when I was outside of the United States, because I had to be away for family reasons for a while.”
Paul Martini, another fellow from last year’s program, said the greatest disappointment about not working in-person on Harvard’s campus was not being able to bring his family to Cambridge.
“I missed the opportunity for my family to experience a different environment for the year, which I think would have been a lot of fun,” Martini said.
Sethi and Martini said they are both looking forward to Radcliffe's plans to bring the 2020-21 cohort to Harvard's campus this coming summer, where they will have the opportunity to convene in person for the first time.
“I really appreciate the fact that they’re having an in-person, on campus session next summer that they’ve invited people to,” Sethi said. “I’m looking forward to being there.”

Faculty at Harvard Medical School developed an online, evidence-based video series to provide clinical guidelines for health care providers around the world and combat misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic.
The online platform — a collaborative effort among HMS professors, clinical experts across multiple Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and Boston-based nonprofit Partners in Health — provides instructional videos on accurate prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Covid-19. The series has been translated into seven different languages and was added to India’s online government repository for pandemic-related information in October.
HMS curriculum fellow Anika T. Singh, who spearheaded the project’s outreach in India, said the video series was created in part to provide up-to-date, accurate clinical information during the pandemic.
“As a global community, what has been really hard about Covid-19 is that it’s such a dynamic, fluid situation that a lot of people hadn’t seen in their lifetime that the cyber community really had to rapidly keep up with,” Singh said.
According to Singh, the program’s organizers hope to address gaps in global clinical education and other issues that have emerged during the pandemic, including misinformation surrounding diagnostic testing, vaccine hesitancy, and the use of unapproved medications.
“What we saw in the Covid-19 pandemic was that there are global weaknesses in health care education, and these can have impacts on evidence-based implementation,” Singh said.
HMS Dean for Research Operations and Global Programs David E. Golan said a major issue the video series sought to address was the global utilization of Covid-19 treatments that lacked scientific backing.
“Medications that were not being used appropriately or according to guidelines had gotten into the popular press and the social media as potential cures for Covid,” Golan said.
In addition to combating the spread of pandemic misinformation, the initiative disseminated the videos to developing countries to help guide clinical practice in low-resource areas.
“One [focus] was how to treat seriously ill patients in village settings and community settings where they can’t necessarily just walk down the street to a hospital,” Golan said.
Aiming to reach more rural populations in India, the initiative is in the process of translating the videos into several local dialects, according to Singh.
“We want to share the information that we have here in a place like Harvard Medical School that is at the cutting edge — the amazing work that people are doing, the amazing doctors we have — and add that to what’s being done in these local areas,” Singh said.
Golan described a “spirit of collaboration” that enabled the growth of the video series and lauded the efforts of HMS faculty, who helped develop the online platform pro bono.
“I think the pandemic has really brought the scientific and medical community together, and my hope for the future is that those collaborations will be sustainable — that people will realize a new way of doing science and a new way of thinking about medicine and treating patients,” Golan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In anticipation of the 137th Harvard-Yale football game this upcoming Saturday, the College Events Board hosted a week of spirit events featuring plate smashing, Yale-bashing stand-up comedy, and musical performances.
The spirit week — an annual tradition held by the CEB — is the first in-person, on-campus spirit week held in two years. Harvard planned a remote spirit week earlier in the pandemic last year, though the Game was canceled.
CEB Co-President Nicole T. Rozelman ’23, who planned the events this year, said she was happy with students' reception of the spirit events.
“I was seeing so many students walking through the Yard and pointing at different things and nudging their friends and being like, ‘Oh my God, let’s go check this out,’” she said.
Yale will not be hosting Harvard students over the weekend of the Game, so the CEB will be hosting an additional event, the HYpeFest, on Friday.
“The Friday event was added this year in recognition that more students than usual might not be able to be overnight in New Haven or get to The Game at all. We wanted a good kickoff event for them on Friday,” Assistant Director of Student Programs Miguel Tejada wrote in an email.
On Tuesday, the CEB hosted CrimsonPalooza, an outdoor festival for undergraduates in Harvard Yard featuring student musicians, a photo booth, games, and free food.
“I just got a free waffle from some random girl. So you know what, I’m living my best life,” attendee Julia S. Casas ’24 said.
A popular attraction at CrimsonPalooza was the “rage room” where attendees had the chance to break ceramic and glass dishes by throwing them against a wall or smashing them with a baseball bat.
“I was able to get a lot of anger out,” said Azeez S. Richardson ’25. “Finals are coming up, there’s just a whole lot of other stuff going on. So that was very cathartic.”
Richardson added the event helped him get more excited for the Game.
“It’s a nice time for Harvard students to really get energized, further socialize, and get ready for the weekend. It’s going to be a huge weekend and I’m excited for it,” he said.
Rozelman said that attendance was especially high at the Bulldog Roast, estimating that 300 people attended the event at the Smith Campus Center on Wednesday evening.
CEB hosted the stand-up comedy event with the Harvard College Stand-Up Comic Society. The event featured student and faculty performers including Andrew J. Berry, a lecturer on organismic and evolutionary biology.
Berry compared Harvard and Yale by a “Nobel-o-meter,” “President-o-meter," college rankings, and the number of Rhodes Scholars from each school. He even referenced the Collegiate Peaks — a mountain range in Colorado with Mt. Harvard as its highest peak and Mt. Yale as its fifth-highest.
Attendees Nishmi H. Abeyweera ’23 and Anjali Chakradhar ’23 said they enjoyed Berry’s act, which included clips from movies that featured Harvard and Yale.
“It was really fun,” Abeyweera said. “Andrew Berry was great as always.”
Student performer Mireya C. Sanchez-Maes ’24 poked fun at Yale during her act, which included beatboxing and fiddling.
“I just want to preface by saying that I actually know nothing about Yale and that’s because I’m a low-income student from a high poverty area and my high school didn’t really teach us about stuff like safety schools,” she said during her comedy act.
Berry ended his act comparing various t-shirts with slogans such as “Yuck Fale” and “Yale, always #2”.
“And finally, as my favorite t-shirt, which is the best of the lot I've seen over the years: what do all Harvard and Yale students have in common? They all got into Yale."

“There’s been a history of folks of color being used as guinea pigs,” said longtime Cambridge resident Yvonne L. Gittens, describing her original reluctance to get the Covid-19 vaccine.
Gittens — who recently received her booster shot — got vaccinated in March at a grassroots vaccine clinic at the Cambridge Community Center, where she teaches cooking and lip balm making, among other specialties, to young girls.
Reflecting on Cambridge’s vaccine rollout, some community leaders said these grassroots clinics have been instrumental in providing information about Covid-19 and easy access to vaccines to Cantabrigians of color, both young and old.
Some residents also explain that Cambridge’s high vaccination rate can be attributed to efforts made by the City, including its push to set up local vaccine clinics and mandate vaccines for Cambridge public school students.
The City has also reported vaccination rates for residents of color that defy national trends: as of Nov. 18, 74 percent of Black residents and 59 percent of Latinx residents are fully vaccinated, while only 33 percent of Black people and 36 percent of Latinx people are fully vaccinated nationwide.
Tony Clark is the president of the Cambridge chapter of My Brother’s Keeper, a national organization that serves young people of color. MBK’s vaccination strategy centered around education, which enables residents make informed decisions on their own, per Clark.
“I don’t think it was a radical thing that we did. Part of it was that we just gave folks information about the vaccine. And we also were able to say, ‘Look, we understand the anxiety. Some of us have it as well,’” Clark said.
In addition from providing information, MBK worked to ensure residents also had convenient access to vaccines.
In spring 2020, MBK ran two vaccine clinics at the Cambridge Community Center with Wayne J. Altman, a professor at Tufts School of Medicine and a doctor at Arlington’s Family Practice Group.
Altman said he experienced a “community grassroots feeling” at the vaccination clinics. On their way out, some attendees shared that they planned to encourage friends and family to get vaccinated, he said.
“What was interesting was when people were leaving, they told the staff at My Brother’s Keeper, ‘I wasn't going to do this. I didn’t really want to get vaccinated. But then I heard about this event, and I trust the people at My Brother's Keeper,’” Altman said.
Clark said MBK originally faced some “pushback” from the City of Cambridge regarding its grassroots approach to vaccination.
“It’s real political, because they felt — some of them — that we need to tell people just to get the shot,” Clark said. “ And I was like, ‘Nah, that’s not what we do.’”
Still, City officials were “supportive and appreciative” of the clinics, per Altman.
Altman said he and MBK hoped to bring grassroots vaccination clinics to nearby cities, but they were sent a letter by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to “cease and desist” their efforts.
“We were told that we were breaking the rule in terms of not being allowed to specify a group to vaccinate, and every vaccine effort had to be available to all citizens,” he said.
Though Cambridge also piloted specific vaccination efforts among residents of color, Altman explained that he believed a local community group like MBK could better address vaccine hesitancy.
In an emailed statement, Cambridge Public Health Department spokesperson Dawn Baxter wrote that the department continues to do “extensive outreach” to residents of color. She cited that CPHD returned to the same public housing buildings multiple times to “educate and build trust” and conducted outreach in multiple languages.
CPHD has vaccinated 4,700 people, per Baxter, 16 percent of whom are Black and 9 percent of whom are Latinx.
In Cambridge Public Schools, where almost 40 percent of students are Black and Latinx, Cambridge School Committee officials like Ayesha M. Wilson have faced another vaccination frontier.
“There’s been a lot of hesitancy across the board,” Wilson said. “I think in particular in this age group, we’re not doing a really great job in terms of educating them.”
The 16 to 19 age group in Cambridge is just 49 percent fully vaccinated, making this demographic the least vaccinated of all eligible age groups in Cambridge.
Wilson said she believes much of the lag is coming from vaccine-hesitant parents because kids under 18 need parental consent to get vaccinated.
On Nov. 22, CPS will begin enforcing a vaccination requirement for all students wanting to participate in extracurriculars, which school officials hope will drive up vaccination rates.
Nuriel Vera-DeGraff, a vaccinated senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, said there have been a “variety of responses” to the mandate.
Though Vera-DeGraff said he believes the mandate is a “good incentive,” he added that there are “students who are suffering” from the mandate due to vaccine-hesitant parents prohibiting their children from receiving the vaccine.
“These are young people who may want to participate in sports, so they’re having a bit of a challenge in that level of dialogue with their parents around,” Wilson said of the mandate. “Having those difficult conversations is also what I’m hearing is coming up for some of our young people.”
Executive Director of the Community Art Center Erin Muirhead McCarty said an unvaccinated parent she spoke to — who is struggling to find employment due to her vaccination status — occupies a “middle space” in the vaccination reluctance spectrum.
“[The parent] also mentioned that it’s not as easy to get the vaccines as it used to be — that she felt like there were more opportunities to get vaccinated earlier on,” McCarty said. “So if there are hurdles and challenges and obstacles that interfere in getting the vaccine, if it’s not easy for people who are in that middle space, it’ll be status quo.”
“They’re not going to jump through a bunch of hoops,” she added.
Gittens, the teacher at the Cambridge Community Center, said some of her family members still refuse to get the vaccine, even after her positive experience at the clinic.
One Black unvaccinated Cambridge resident, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from his employer, said he continues to harbor concerns about the vaccine, though he is not “totally against it.”
The resident said he believes some Black residents may continue to be hesitant to get vaccinated due to mistrust in the government stemming from previous unethical medical experiments.
He cited the Tuskegee experiment in which Black men were given syphilis by the Centers for Disease Control and were intentionally prevented from receiving treatment for the disease once a cure was discovered.
Local leaders said they will continue to work to spread accurate information about the vaccine to residents as the rollout of vaccines for the 5 to 11 age group is underway and booster shots become widely available to all.
Wilson, the Cambridge school official, said the City should prioritize education and promote messaging on the health benefits of the vaccine.
“We need to make sure that we’re really staying clear of ‘fake news’ and that we’re able to really hone in on the effectiveness, the importance around keeping ourselves safe and our community safe,” Wilson said. “And really go into a place of us as an individual in the larger society.”

After a semester in which she felt driven out of her own apartment by bullying and discrimination, Harvard graduate student Emmeline (not her real name) logged onto a Zoom meeting in early July with hopes the University administrators she was meeting with could turn the situation around.
During the roughly hour-long meeting, Emmeline said, she told the administrators — including Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean of Student Affairs Samuel H. Bersola — of her two GSAS roommates’ months of behavior that left her feeling unsafe in the apartment. The events led her to withdraw from the semester early and return home.
Yet after logging off the call, Emmeline said she felt the administrators had made the situation worse. During the meeting, she said, Bersola encouraged her to move on from the complaint and instead turn her attention back to coursework to ensure she could receive her Harvard degree. Though the administrators pledged to look into her allegations further, she said the call left her distrustful they would do so — and so she stopped responding to their emails.
After she re-engaged in September, GSAS launched an investigation that concluded this month without a formal hearing and found no violations of GSAS policies, according to an email obtained by The Crimson.
Emmeline and other graduate students familiar with her circumstances say her case is representative of many graduate students’ attempts to seek recourse for bullying, harassment, discrimination, and worse through the University’s internal channels. The Crimson granted Emmeline anonymity to discuss allegations of bullying and identity-based discrimination, many of which were corroborated by classmates.
Harvard Divinity School Student Association Council president Maya C. James said she saw certain administrators’ urges for Emmeline to move on as an implicit way of discouraging her from escalating the situation.
“At one point, she was told by an administrator, you should just put this behind you and focus on school,” James said. “And the way I translated that was, ‘Don’t bite the hand that’s feeding you — this Harvard degree — and don’t cause trouble,’ even though if anything, she was just trying to respond to the trouble that was forced upon her.”
In recent weeks, 140 people have signed a petition addressed to GSAS’s Office of Student Affairs calling for structural reform of current grievance-processing procedures, as well as an “immediate and fair” formal hearing for Emmeline.
“The actions of [Emmeline’s roommates] are in clear violation of the Academic Code of Conduct. Yet, they have not been held accountable through any of Harvard’s provided means of conflict resolution. There has been no hearing,” the petition reads. “Our student has suffered significant and lasting mental distress and financial harm as a result of the actions from the GSAS students, and has taken a medical leave of absence as a direct result.”
GSAS spokesperson Ann Hall wrote in an emailed statement that though the school is legally unable to comment on specific cases, it takes complaints seriously and students must follow conduct expectations outlined in GSAS’s policies.
“GSAS takes complaints of discrimination and harassment very seriously and cares deeply about students’ wellbeing,” Hall wrote. “GSAS students are required to abide by the expectations for conduct outlined in GSAS policies and GSAS has an established disciplinary process to address complaints about student conduct.”
In written testimony she emailed to administrators in May, Emmeline said the last few months had been exhausting and irrevocably detracted from her first year of graduate school.
“I’m tired of writing angry letters. I’m tired of verbalizing my pain. I’m tired of feeling pain. I just want to be a student,” she wrote.
In late August, Emmeline unsuccessfully attempted suicide through a drug overdose.
Emmeline traveled to Cambridge with high hopes for her first year. Those hopes, however, were swiftly dashed by her roommates’ behavior and subsequent attempts to implore administrators to remedy the situation, she said.
In the May written testimony, Emmeline outlined what she saw as verbal bullying, xenophobia, and identity-based discrimination by her roommates between January and May. In one instance, for example, she alleges one roommate questioned Emmeline’s medical credentials because her medical degree is from a country in the Global South.
Following those interactions, Emmeline took a leave of absence, citing declining mental health. After leaving her meeting with administrators on July 1 disillusioned, she stopped responding to their follow-up emails, in which they had offered to look further into the matter. The next month was when Emmeline unsuccessfully attempted suicide.
She re-connected with administrators in September, giving them permission to interview her roommates about the allegations. Bersola informed her by email on Nov. 5 that the GSAS Faculty Board had not found sufficient evidence that her roommates had violated the school’s policies, and that the Board would not move forward with a formal hearing.
Divinity School Muslim Student Association president Xavier I. Sayeed said it was difficult to observe Emmeline’s visible decline in mental health during the months she liaised with administrators.
“To see someone experience something that makes them distrustful and want to withdraw themselves from the community is really heartbreaking — and especially in this case, somebody who was such a force of joy and passion,” Sayeed said.
Former HDS Student Association president Malini Srikrishna said the past few months have had severe repercussions for Emmeline.
“She’s had to drop out of school for one semester, take a leave of absence,” Srikrishna said. “Everything about her life has been disrupted.”
Srikrishna alleged GSAS’s determination that Emmeline’s roommates had not violated any GSAS policies runs counter to its stated commitment to inclusivity and addressing interpersonal harm.
“We’re trying to create an environment where we really draw the line and make clear there’s no tolerance for this behavior,” Srikrishna said. “Because if these people are let go, clearly that means there’s tolerance for this behavior.”
For James, the HDS Student Association president, one of the most alarming parts of helping Emmeline through the process was learning that Emmeline’s experience was not a rare one.
“While she was speaking with different people, they were like, 'almost your exact situation has happened multiple times before,'” James said. “A big part of it is: Why is there an institutional memory of all of this harm happening in the exact same way to people with very similar identities, and why is there no institutional memory of repair from that? Again, it doesn’t make sense.”
Others who sat in on Emmeline’s meetings with administrators disputed GSAS’s decision not to grant her a formal hearing.
Noor I. Traina, who attended a meeting between Emmeline and University Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer Sherri A. Charleston on Tuesday, said Charleston told Emmeline that the University had exhausted the institutional channels it could use to address her complaint. Traina said she disagrees.
“She has 25 pages documenting exactly what happened to her — with Harvard students,” Traina said. “They violated a Code of Conduct the University obliges them to agree to.”
The GSAS Code of Conduct states that any form of discrimination on the basis of factors including race, religion, and national or ethnic origin is “unlawful” and counter to Harvard policies.
Bullying is not covered by Harvard’s Title IX procedures unless it is found to involve gender- and sexual-based harassment. Following student activism on the issue, particularly from Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, the University launched three working groups in January to review policies on behavior that falls outside the purview of Title IX, including bullying.
In an interview, Emmeline said her conversations with multiple administrators revealed that they, too, recognized the lengthy and exhausting process of seeking recourse through existing University channels.
“What really surprised me was seeing how many other people in the administration warn you about this, which is deeply symptomatic of the problem,” she said. “This is basically evidence that they all know that it is a purgatory out there — it’s a limbo.”
Azani A. Creeks, who serves on the Divinity School Student Association, said she believes that in order to help students like Emmeline, the University must address systemic deficiencies in existing policies.
“I think that a lot of these structures were put into place in order to be difficult,” she said. “That’s not to say that administrators who work on these processes now feel that way or won’t want to help students — I just think that the existing bureaucratic structures are meant to limit and discourage complaints.”
Creeks also pointed to the fact that the lengthy processes involved in reporting instances of harm may discourage students from engaging with the process altogether.
“You have to relive your experience and recount your experience over and over, telling different people just to be pointed to another person after you tell them everything you’ve experienced,” she said.
James said she witnessed Emmeline being bounced between administrators in such a way, leaving Emmeline feeling discouraged and unaccounted for.
“I was there with her while she was proposing emails or sorting out who she would talk to next,” she said. “It was a lot of dead ends, silence, and passiveness — I think passiveness was the worst part of it.”
Emmeline said that though she was unsurprised by GSAS’s assessment that her roommates had not violated any GSAS policies, she was disappointed nonetheless.
“I was very sad to hear it, but in a way I was also relieved, because that basically meant that there was nothing to hope for,” she said. “They had me hoping for the longest time that maybe if someone actually serious looked at it, they would see that I was harmed, and actually do something about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts in the fields of psychedelics, health care, and bioethics gathered virtually to discuss the ethical implications of psychedelic-assisted therapy in a webinar held by Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center on Thursday.
The event, which examined the ethical and legal considerations at play when administering psychedelic substances, approached the topic from both experimental and clinical perspectives. Panelists discussed the issues of informed consent, experimental standardization, and the possibilities of abuse.
The event was part of the center’s first-of-its-kind Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation — a three-year program launched this July which aims to “advance evidence-based psychedelics law and policy.”
Early in the discussion, Holly Fernandez Lynch, a medical ethics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said it was important to ensure psychedelic research participants could give “adequate informed consent.”
“With regard to the desperation of some patients in these populations, that can raise challenges about making sure they understand what they’re getting themselves into, and that they have realistic expectations,” Fernandez Lynch said. “They may not have any good treatment options outside of the research setting.”
Regarding underground psychedelic therapy, William R. Smith, another UPenn researcher, said there remains “a lot of variability” that must be overcome between groups.
“One of the difficulties moving forward is that there are different standards in different communities’ practice,” Smith said. “What can be expected kind of depends on where you are and who you’re talking to.”
Karin Gagnon, a psychotherapy researcher at Oregon Health Sciences University, said if she could choose one point of emphasis, it would be “education, education, education.”
“Education is more important than policies or laws,” Gagnon said. “Who has that qualified information? How do we disseminate it? Who funds it?”
Gagnon added that the use of words like psychedelics or drugs is “limiting” and “damaging” to the research.
“Having a precise common language as we roll this out from the research sector is really important,” she said.
One significant ethical dilemma discussed during the event was the possibility of boundary violations while a patient is in an altered state.
Alissa Bazinet, a clinical psychologist on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board, said “power differentials” could be exacerbated by psychedelics, as well as transference — the process by which emotions are redirected during therapy toward the therapist.
“Boundaries can be blurred between a therapist and client in a non-ordinary state of consciousness, which can lead to, sometimes, feeling as if the client and therapist are friends or have love between one another,” Bazinet said.
She added that traditional therapeutic boundaries could be further complicated by psychedelic-assisted therapy’s “element of touch,” such as holding a client’s hand, which Bazinet said could be an “integral part of their healing.”
In an email, Carmel D. Shachar, the Petrie-Flom Center’s executive director, wrote the webinar was “the kind of conversation we hope to foster moving forward.”
“There is so much ferment and change going on in the field of psychedelics,” Shachar wrote. “Having the space to think through the ethical and regulatory challenges and opportunities raised by the increased interest and use of psychedelics is vital.”
Bazinet concluded the webinar with the example of Oregon — where possession of all controlled substances has been decriminalized — as a model for the future.
“It’s been a really exciting challenge to think about how we can maybe try to do everything,” Bazinet said. “It feels like a grand experiment, but I’m hopeful that we can figure it out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off fantastic team performances at the Ivy League Championships two weeks ago, the Harvard men and women’s cross country teams both qualified for NCAA nationals, with the women winning regionals for the second season in a row dating back to 2019 and the men placing second in a field of over 35 teams.
Entering the meet, the Crimson women were ranked 4th in the region, trailing No. 17 Syracuse, No. 24 Providence, and UConn. Continuing their late season resurgence, the unranked Harvard squad won their second championship meet in a row with 71 points, ten points ahead of the Orange, who finished in second, and 37 points ahead of the Friars, who finished in third.
Leading the way for the Crimson was sophomore Iz Sagar, who continued her dominant season for Havard following her third place finish at the Ivy League Championships two weeks ago. Crossing the line in fifth with a time of 20:41, Sagar improved dramatically from her 24th-place finish in the 2019 NCAA regionals race as a freshman. Behind Sagar was first-year standout Maia Ramsden who placed ninth with a time of 20:58. Ramsden was the third freshman to cross the finish line at regionals, an incredible individual achievement forthe New Zealand native.
With the strong finishes from Sagar and Ramsden, the key to the win for the Crimson was the cohesiveness of the back three scorers. The Harvard women were the only team to place all five of their scorers in the top 20 of the race. Leading the pack was sophomore Eloise Freitag, who placed 18th with a time of 21:10. Just behind Freitag were senior co-captains Judy Pendergast in 19th and Anna Juul in 20th. Both co-captains were strong scorers on the 2019 championship team and were able to beat most other team’s 3rd, 4th, and 5th best runners. First-year Isabelle Goldstein rounded out her quality debut season with a top-35 finish.
“I think our collective mindset has always been fixed on November races,” said Sagar on the team’s late season performance. “It’s easy to quickly deplete one’s physical, mental, and emotional reserves early, so we try to avoid this by training and recovering intentionally, always thinking about things from a broader perspective.”
Following the race, all five of the Harvard scorers were named to the NCAA Northeast All-Region Team, an indicator of the depth of the Crimson women. Going into Nationals this weekend, Harvard will hope to surpass their 31st place finish in 2019 and continue surprising teams along the way.
For the men, the regional rankings have been a toss-up all season long as Harvard, Iona, No. 23 Syracuse, and Providence have battled for the top position. Going into the 10k race, the at times top-heavy No. 26 Crimson men knew they would need a complete race to qualify for NCAA nationals. With strong individual performances across the board, Harvard placed 2nd in the regionals bout with 68 points, trailing only the Orange who won the meet with a strong 51 points.
Leading the Crimson in second place was first-year Graham Blanks, continuing a decorated opening year to his Harvard career. Blanks was the first freshman to cross the line in the meet with a time of 30:04, marking an outstanding individual performance for the runner from Athens, G.A. The next-best freshman finished in 19th. Just behind Blanks was senior break-out star Matthew Pereira who, fresh off of setting a new Harvard and course record at the Ivy League Championships two weeks ago, crossed in an impressive fourth with a time of 30:19. Within a second of Pereira was sophomore Acer Iverson, who continued his impressive 2021 campaign, finishing in fifth. In a field of over 230 runners, the Crimson were the only team across the two meets who placed three runners in the top five of the meet, an impressive achievement for the program.
Rounding out the scoring for Harvard was senior co-captain David Melville, who placed 20th with a time of 30:58 and sophomore Ben Hartvigsen who placed 37th with a time of 31:31. Fellow senior co-captain Michael Alber crossed the line in 48th, placing in the top fourth of the meet.
While the Crimson men were unable to defend their NCAA regionals championship from 2019 due to a strong performance from Syracuse who placed runners third, sixth, eight, 13th, and 21st, the second place was good enough to get Harvard to NCAA nationals for the second year in a row.
“Our team goals are pretty clear, we just want a good race from each person one through seven. If we can get everyone to have a good day then we have a very high ceiling when it comes to overall placement as a team,” commented Melville on the team strategy going into this weekend. “The bump up to 10k plus the two races in eight days setup of nationals really helps us out compared to other teams because of the way we train, so we are looking to take advantage of those factors as well.”
Following the race, the top four scorers for Harvard were named to the NCAA Northeast All-Region Team, bringing the total to nine runners across the program. With both teams advancing to NCAA nationals for the second season in a row, the Crimson are quietly establishing themselves as a program to be reckoned with under the leadership of head coach Alex Gibby.
“Our returners have improved significantly and we also have new team members that have been performing really well this season,” noted Alber on the team this year. “We definitely want to improve upon our 15th place finish from two years ago and are eyeing a top 10 finish. It’s an ambitious goal but I believe it’s possible with this group. We did a good job at regionals but we have more left in the tank and we’re looking forward to showing that at nationals.”
Heading into nationals, the Harvard women jumped from unranked to No. 24, and the men jumped from No. 26 to No. 25. Both teams will have the task of improving on their 2019 finishes, including a 15th place finish for the men in 2019. Nationals will take place Saturday, November 20th at FSU.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This is a really special time for Harvard field hockey,” reflected field hockey head coach and Ivy League Coach of the Year Tjerk van Herwaarden. “So many people have put in so much time and sacrifice to be part of this team.”
And a special time it is for this remarkable team ─ on Friday, they will make history when they step onto Phyllis Ocker Field in Ann Arbor as the first Harvard field hockey team ever to play in a Final Four game. The Crimson (17-1, 7-0) will challenge yet another Big Ten school: the Northwestern Wildcats (16-5, 5-3 Big Ten).
This is no small feat by any means. But this team has proved itself as a force to be reckoned with, defeating the number two team in the nation 1-0 (Michigan) in a penalty shootout win, and holding several top titles across Division I field hockey: the number one goals-against average (0.35), the number one save percentage (0.875), the number one shutouts per game (0.61), and the number one winning percentage (0.944).
“Our season has been very successful with everything that has happened, with the Ivy League championship, to the final four, beating those teams that we did,” van Herwaarden said. “We can only be very proud of what we were able to accomplish this past season. Anything we get from this moment on is going to be a massive bonus. We are going to prepare well, put ourselves in the right mindset, and do what we can to be competitive with Northwestern.”
No. 7 Northwestern took down the reigning NCAA tournament championUniversity of North Carolina in the first round of the competition last weekend (W, 2-0), a team that has taken home the title for the past three years (2018, 2019, 2020). Last year, No. 2 Michigan was the runner-up to UNC. To get to the Final Four, the Wildcats took down No. 4 Iowa (W, 1-0) in the quarterfinal round.
“Northwestern will be a whole different team with some different strengths that we want to take care of, so to that extent there will be some nuance changes in our preparation,” commented van Herwaarden.
The Wildcats hold some notable statistics themselves. One player, forward Bente Baekers, holds the number five slot in all of DI field hockey in points per game (2.26), and also grasps the seventh-best ranking in goals per game (0.89). The team is number two in the nation for scoring average (3.44), and number three for scoring margin (2.38), only three up from Harvard (1.82). When it comes to assists per game, the Wildcats have clinched the number three seat (2.81), and are the second-best in the nation for goals per game (3.57) and points per game (9.95).
Northwestern seems to pose a real offensive threat to the Crimson. But at the core of Harvard’s success this season and in its NCAA run so far has been its defense.
“Our defense has been tested this whole entire season,” remarked the head coach. “I think they are the main reason why we are where we are at this moment, and I think that defense will have to step up again if we want to advance.”
Two of the Crimson’s strongest defensive players include junior goalkeeper Ellie Shahbo, who holds the number one goals-against average (0.35) and save percentage (0.875) in all of Division I field hockey, and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and 2021 NFHCA Senior Team select senior Hannah Pearce.
“With our defense like Ellie Shahbo and Hannah Pearce, I think we are in the best position to [win], stay in the moment, and enjoy it as much as we can,” said van Herwaarden. This team has risen to every single challenge that we have faced this season.”
A new challenge the Wildcats may offer is their incredibly strong individual players. Rather than the power dissipating equally across different lines, Northwestern may bank on the talent of exceptional players like Baekers.
“Northwestern is a very, very good team with some very strong individuals,” van Herwaarden commented. “I think that might be the biggest difference from Louisville and [Michigan] which might have been more of a team attack. Northwestern might have a bit of [bank] on individual quality function on some people so that will definitely be a test for us.”
Despite whatever new proposition the Crimson will face on Friday, the team has demonstrated their ability to adapt to any situation presented during a game. Whether that be overtime in a scoreless game, penalty shootouts, yellow cards, or a weather delay due to snow, they have proven that they are apt to handle anything.
“The key takeaway is that this team has shown unbelievable resilience and grit to deal with any scenario you can face in the game,” the head coach said. “First a three hour snow delay, a stroke that gets called back, a corner for Michigan that gets called back.”
“When we had to deal with a man down, and they had man-down situations that we did not capitalize on, yet at the end we became victorious by preparing well,” he said. “We were one step ahead.”
Being one step ahead has not come without putting in the extra hours of intense practice and dedication to be their best. In the shootout against Michigan, the Crimson went a perfect 3-for-3 and Shahbo stopped all three goals attempted by the Wolverines.
“Ellie Shahbo did a great job in shootout defense,” said van Herwaarden. “But we also made ours. I think that had to do with the hours of practice. When all the kids are heading to the showers, our shootout players are still on the field practicing their shootouts and that’s now paying off.”
There is something special about the NCAA tournament thus far: No. 10 Harvard defeating No. 6 Louisville (1-0) and then winning in a shootout against the Big Ten’s number two Michigan (1-0). No. 7 Northwestern defeated the title holders UNC (2-0) and No. 4 Iowa (1-0).
If anything, these high-stake matches have shown that it is anyone’s game.
The Crimson will face the Wildcats in Ann Arbor, Mich. on Friday at 3:00 p.m. If Harvard wins Friday’s game, they will advance to the NCAA championship to play the winner of the No. 9 Liberty/No. 5 Maryland game on Sunday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dear Crimson,
I understand how great it must feel to be listed ahead of Yale alphabetically; I can barely contain my excitement with our dominance over York College of Pennsylvania. I know this little win is what lets you sleep at night, but you just have to know that there are other ways of measuring which school is better.
We’re all smart here, so let’s start out with some statistics. This weekend is the 137th iteration of The Game, and so far, Yale is leading 68–60–2. Remember in 1957 when the Elis won 54–0? Neither did I, but Wikipedia remembers.
Since The Game became an official Ivy League competition in 1956, Yale has won 27 times. Do you know what other noted team has won 27 times? That’s right, the Yankees. For those of you who do not know, the Yankees are the best team in baseball history with their 27 World Series wins. They are from New York, wear blue and their logo features a Y. Their rivals, the Red Sox — obligatory ew — are from Boston, wear red and their logo features a pair of dirty, smelly socks.
I know of a liberal arts school in Connecticut that lies in the New York metropolitan area and has a logo that is a blue Y. Its rival also happens to be red, dirty, smelly and from Boston.
I am sure you have heard of Handsome Dan. You know, that slobbery, loveable little bulldog who has been the face of Yale since 1889. Dan was the pet of one of our football players, and the team loved him so much that he was raised to the podium of the first college mascot ever. Schools and teams across the country loved Dan so much that now the bulldog is the most popular high school and college mascot. Handsome Dan is a living being who we personally know, respect and admire for his professional commitment to our cause.
Now. Crimson. What is a crimson? Are you too good to say your color is red? Is it to establish dominance over noted safety school Corn-L? Yale has its own proprietary color too, but we are not known as the “Yale Blues.”
“But we have John Harvard!”
You mean a person dresses in a costume to look like another person? Is that supposed to instill fear in your opponents? Sure, bulldogs are not the biggest of breeds but they were bred to fight bulls, which I think is pretty badass.
I had the distinct displeasure of driving up to Cambridge last month to watch the Head of the Charles Regatta. My friends and I spent the afternoon in Boston watching the boats go by. After our lightweights finished first, we crossed the river and infiltrated your home.
We witnessed block after block of red brick buildings on your “campus.” How are we supposed to tell your residential colleges — sorry, I mean houses — from your libraries or classroom buildings? They all look the exact same. Yale has some brick, but we also have … not brick.
Before we headed home, we passed Harvard Stadium. The concrete monstrosity only seats 30,000 people — less than half of the Yale Bowl’s capacity. Was the incomplete bowl layout a ploy to make it look like you have a full house, even though your student body is too busy studying to ever have fun?
What a relief it was to find out The Game would be hosted by Yale for two competitions in a row — probably the one good thing to come out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Remember the 2019 Game? You know, where we came back from behind and won in double overtime? I do not think we are ever going to let that one go.
Sure, it was just one game. But you know what? I do not slip in where I go to school in every conversation. I do not go to the quintessential stick-in-the-mud legacy school. That is why it is such a big deal to beat the obvious supervillain. If we are the underdogs, then we are exactly who audiences root for. The underdog always wins. Even when they do not win the battle, they win over the hearts.
Go, run along with your tail between your legs after we beat you again this weekend. Scurry back to the second best school in your suburb so you can get to class on Monday.
Simply put: your veritas sucks if you ain’t got that lux.
Go Blue,

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the old adage goes, “Eventually, all great things must come to an end.” Harvard (7-2, 4-2) concludes its season against Yale (5-4, 4-2) in New Haven, Conn., in the 137th installment of The Game, which will mark the final chapter in what has been a successful season for the Crimson. Harvard has recorded its 17th campaign with at least seven wins this century, its defense has held opposing offenses to the lowest rushing average in the country, and junior running back Aaron Shampklin became the eighth back in school history to reach 2,000 career rushing yards. Saturday’s contest will also be the final game in the brilliant career of senior linebacker Jordan Hill, who is serving as the program’s 147th captain this season.
The native of Silver Spring, Md., first played for the Crimson in 2016, just one season removed from Harvard’s 17th Ivy League championship. After an illustrious career at Paint Branch High School, in which he served as the captain for two seasons and earned Second Team All-State honors his senior year, he continued to make his impact felt after arriving in Cambridge. The team’s leading tackler in his sophomore and junior seasons, Hill has garnered All-Ivy honors twice and enters his final game needing two total tackles to pass current defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99 for fourth in program history.
“It’s crazy to think that this is it. Six years that I’ve been here. I’m extremely proud of what I’ve done. … It’s crazy to be here and to have this opportunity in front of myself and in front of this team,” Hill said. “No two seasons, no two teams are the same … When it’s gone, it’s gone, and having those opportunities to just play with your guys, to work out with your guys, to just grind with the dudes who are putting in that work with you is something that I definitely have valued in my career.”
In his four years, Hill has racked up an impressive resume. In 2016, he set a school record for a first-year player by recording 17 tackles in an overtime win against Princeton, which remains his career high. Overall, he has amassed 242 tackles, including 14.5 for a loss of yards and four sacks. He also won one Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week award in 2019 after totaling 10 tackles, including 2.5 for a loss in a win against Cornell. Although he will not be able to suit up for the Crimson in 2022, Hill is hopeful that he will be able to continue his career at a professional level.
“I’m hoping to stay in this game for as long as I can,” he said. “Right now I’m just focused on finishing out this season strong, but hopefully I get an opportunity to play at the next level, and I’m going to do everything I can to be prepared for that moment.”
Yet, as one of the most valuable players in Harvard’s history plays his final snaps for the team, Saturday’s matchup will also mark the continuation of a long-standing and famous tradition. Since 1875, the Crimson and Bulldogs have clashed on the gridiron 136 times, with Yale holding a narrow 68-60-8 edge. Before last year, when The Game was canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the last time the two schools failed to face off was 1944, during World War II.
Since its inception, the annual contest has produced numerous memorable games, arguably the most famous of which being Harvard’s famous comeback in 1968, when it trailed 29-13 with 42 seconds remaining before managing a 29-29 tie. That showdown featured legendary actor Tommy Lee Jones, who was a guard for the Crimson at the time, and inspired Kevin Rafferty’s critically acclaimed 2008 documentary, Harvard Beats Yale 29-29.
Although the Bulldogs were dominant for much of the series’ early history, beating Harvard eight times in a row between 1880 and 1889, the Crimson has flipped the script since Ivy League play began in 1956, leading the series 36-27-1 in that span. Current Harvard head coach Tim Murphy, who took over the team in 1994, has earned the win in 18 of his 26 previous games against Yale.
“There’s nothing like it, honestly,” said sophomore running back Aidan Borguet about playing in The Game. “Having a long rivalry that’s among the best in the nation [is] a feeling like no other. You have people from all over the country that watch The Game … It’s really something special to be a part of.”
Yet, like all good traditions, each edition brings a new wrinkle. This latest iteration of the Crimson is still alive in the conference title chase, although it will require some help to do so. The winner of The Game will earn a share of the Ivy League championship if both Princeton and Dartmouth, which each have one conference loss so far, lose their final games of the season. The Tigers will travel to face Penn (3-6, 1-5)and the Big Green oppose Brown (2-7, 1-5) in Providence, R.I.
Building off the momentum of its last two games, a 49-21 drubbing of Columbia in New York City on Nov. 6 and a hard-fought 23-9 victory over the Quakers on Nov. 13, Murphy will turn to junior quarterback Luke Emge, who earned the starting job after performing capably in relief of senior Jake Smith in the Oct. 30 loss to Dartmouth. In four games this season, the Lancaster, Pa., native has completed 58.7 percent of his passes for 463 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception. In the Lions contest, he connected with junior Kym Wimberly seven times to make him the Crimson’s first 100-yard receiver since 2019.
Emge will be complemented by a bevy of playmakers, including Shampklin, the superstar running back and All-Ivy First Team selection in 2018, who leads the conference with weekly averages of 96.9 rushing yards and 109.5 all-purpose yards. He has also found the end zone 12 total times, which trails only Dartmouth quarterback Nick Howard (14). Additionally, Borguet returns to the venue that put him on the map, when he took his 11 carries for 269 yards and four touchdowns in 2019. Harvard’s two-headed monster has caused fits for opposing defenses all season, torching them to the tune of 170.2 rushing yards per game.
In addition to the backfield duo, offensive coordinator Mickey Fein will be able to turn to a trio of speedy wide receivers in Wimberly, senior B.J. Watson, and junior Demarkes Stradford. 6’7” senior wide receiver/long snapper Adam West, 6’4” sophomore tight end Haven Montefalco, and 6’3” junior tight end Adam Shepherd give Emge his choice of big targets for red zone possessions.
Harvard’s key to victory may lie on the offensive line, which has been an elite unit this year, opening up holes for Shampklin and Borguet and conceding just 13 sacks, the third-fewest among Ancient Eight squads. On Saturday, though, it will come up against the most dangerous pass-rusher it has faced so far this season, Yale defensive tackle Clay Patterson, who has been an interior force all season, racking up 11.5 sacks in nine games, making him the second-most efficient pass-rusher in the nation, behind only Florida A&M’s Isaiah Land, who has 17 sacks in ten games.
“[Patterson]’s a guy with a high motor. He’s big. He’s athletic. He’s twitched up,” Borguet said. “He seems to be one of their premier playmakers in the front seven, so [we] have to be cognizant of where he is and run our own game plan the way our coaches decide to execute it.”
Patterson is not the only Bulldog capable of getting to the quarterback, though. All in all, Yale has brought down the opposing passer 29 times in nine games, the second-best rate in the Ivy League and eighth-best in the country. Defensive back Dathan Hickey has forced four fumbles in just seven games, the second-best rate in FCS. The Bulldogs also boast a respectable rush defense, allowing an average of 119.3 yards per game.
Yale will also force Emge to succeed early in the possession, as the Bulldog defense has been especially strong on third down, allowing conversions on just 22.6 percent of its opponents’ attempts, which is the lowest rate in the country. The Bulldogs feature athletic players all throughout the field, including linebacker Rodney Thomas II, who ranks 18th in the country with nine pass deflections, and linebacker John Dean, who leads the team with 66 tackles.
“They fly around. They cover gaps. They do what they need to do, and they know their assignments,” Borguet said. “They make plays on the ball, so it’s tough when guys like [Thomas] get in the way of what you’re trying to do. So our coaches are going to come up with a great game plan, and we go along with the schemes that they come up with and we just execute.”
Harvard counters the Bulldog linebacker with a talented Thomas of its own, senior cornerback Khalid Thomas, who has intercepted three passes this season and defended five more. Khalid Thomas’s rate of 0.4 interceptions per game paces the Ivy League, and his teammate, sophomore cornerback Alex Washington is not far behind, with three interceptions in nine games. Additionally, sophomore cornerback Khalil Dawsey, who returned an interception for a touchdown in an Oct. 2 win over Holy Cross, returned last week after a five-game absence. The Crimson’s talented secondary has helped it rank fifth in the FCS in team passing efficiency defense (101.0). Its front seven has also racked up 36 sacks this season, the second-most prolific pass rush in the country.
Despite Harvard’s success against the pass, Yale would probably be best suited to take to the air on Saturday, because the Crimson has wreaked even more havoc on opposing running backs. Harvard has held opponents to just 54.6 yards per game, nearly 15 yards better than second-ranked Sam Houston. Larkee’s unit is led by talented playmakers such as first-year defensive tackle Thor Griffith, who leads the team with 9.5 tackles for a loss this season. Junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes has recorded seven sacks and junior safety James Herring paces the team with 63 tackles. Together, they have helped the Crimson produce top-ten rankings in third-down conversion percentage (fourth, 26.2 percent), fourth-down conversion percentage (second, 22.7 percent), and red zone defense (seventh, 65.2 percent).
The Bulldogs counter with a prolific passing offense, led by sophomore quarterback Nolan Grooms. The southpaw has shown significant promise with both his arm and his legs, frequently using his athleticism to extend plays. Overall, he has completed 55.2 percent of his passes for 1,307 yards, 11 touchdowns, and five interceptions. He has also added 91 carries for 374 yards and three more scores on the ground.
“He has a lot of confidence,” Hill said. “He’ll make some throws that typically you wouldn’t see from a quarterback, across his body and whatnot, and he has a real knack for extending plays with his legs and getting out of the pocket once the rush does get there, so those are things that we’re all aware of.”
Yale surrounds Grooms with playmakers at the wide receiver position, especially senior Melvin Rouse II, who has caught at least three passes in every game this season. Overall, Rouse, a converted defensive back, has caught 45 passes for 531 yards and a pair of scores. Senior wide receiver Darrion Carrington, who has added 242 yards and three touchdowns of his own, will supplement the Yale attack, and running back Spencer Alston, who has turned his 77 carries into 372 yards and seven touchdowns, will provide support on the ground.
For the Crimson to come out victorious for the 61st time against its archrivals, it will have to do so in a hostile environment, where throngs of Bulldog supporters will undoubtedly come out to the Yale Bowl (capacity: 61,446) in full force. Harvard players hope that they can rely on the busloads of Crimson students traveling down from Cambridge on Friday and Saturday to cheer on the team. The visitors can expect to have a large traveling party, as shuttle tickets sold out in less than 48 hours.
“When we play at Yale, we tend to travel quite a good amount, so it’s nice looking up at your own student section and seeing familiar faces,” Borguet said. “That can kind of calm the nerves from a hostile environment like the Yale Bowl.”

After a long semester of seeing the same masked faces from your lectures and sections, get ready for an exciting change of pace with the return of The Game this coming weekend. New city, new experiences, new friends… a new special someone? Read on for our tips on where, when, and how to engineer the perfect Harvard-Yale meet cute!
Classic Coffee Shop Kismet: Blue State Coffee
Call it old-school, but you can never beat a New England coffee shop meet cute. Blue State Coffee is a great place to not only fuel up before the Game, but scout out romantic Yalie potentials first thing in the morning (no judgement). Make eye contact with that cutie in the corner so they can witness your frighteningly dark yet charming eyebags after the long drive to New Haven, and bat your eyelashes over an $11 avocado toast. These classic moves can never serve you wrong.
Climbing the Cell Towers for Phone Service
If you haven’t been to the Game before, please believe EVERYTHING that everyone has told you about the Yale stadium being in the literal middle of nowhere. Just, in the deep woods of Connecticut. In other words: absolutely no cell service to be found, anywhere. But imagine how romantic a meet cute at the top of the New Haven cell towers would be as you’re desperately trying to use Find My Friends to track down your blockmates?
Yale Student Section Invasion
Just picture it: your bright, crimson sweater bobbing amongst a sea of bulldog blue. You lock eyes with a special someone over the crowd of Yalies inexplicably stripping en masse. They think, “Who is that incredibly hot, stunning, mysterious stranger in maroon?” You two slowly make your way over to each other, picking through the throng. Those first sweet, fateful introductions are finally exchanged as the band plays “All I Want for Christmas Is You” for the sixth time. It’s perfect.
GHeav or A 2000’s Rom-Com?
The affectionate colloquial name for Good Nature Market (think: Yale’s subpar analogue to late-night Noch’s), GHeav is the perfect place to run into a beautiful stranger and also chow down on overpriced sandwiches at 2 a.m.— the quintessential college experience everywhere. Workshop your best pick-up lines for this one; only time will tell what special magic the deli’s bright fluorescent lights and hordes of sweaty college students may provide for you this weekend.
A Tender Toad’s Tale
Ah yes, Toad’s. Part New Haven nightclub, part dimly lit purgatorial discotheque. In all honesty, you’ll just have to let fate run its course within the sticky walls of this infamous venue. Plus, cross your fingers that they play some decent songs so any serendipitous romantic run-in out on that crowded dance floor occurs with a backing soundtrack to make it the stuff of movies (one can only dream*).
*Seriously… this is a reach. You are not going to meet your one true love in Toad’s. Snap out of it.
Honestly, meeting new people at Yale is truly all in good fun, no matter your intentions. Just remember that if all else fails, you will very likely not see any of these people again (at least not for another year). After all, this is all about football! Right? Go Crimson!

Last academic year, while I was sitting on my couch, bundled up in my pajamas and cueing the next episode of Tiger King, Lindsay W. Reed ’23 was changing the tequila game with KAWAMA Tequila & Soda, a company she conceived and founded from the ground-up during the Covid-19 pandemic. I know, #GirlBoss.
To learn more about how she started Kawama and to *selfishly* gain tips on how to be an absolute legend, I chatted with Lindsay and am here to share her wisdom with you. Take notes.
DMG: To get started, could you give the classic Harvard intro: your year, house, concentration, where you're from, and anything else you want to share?
LWR: Yeah, sure. So I am now Harvard Class of ’23. I took all of last year off because of the Covid-19 pandemic to start this venture with Kawama. I am concentrating in Economics, and I'm associated with Kirkland House. I'm also on the women's Ice Hockey team.
DMG: What inspired you to start your own business, Kawama, over your gap year? 
LWR: When the pandemic started, we kind of were all sitting at home...and I came up with this idea. I saw the RTD market, which stands for ready-to-drink cocktail market, was absolutely exploding. It was a pandemic: everyone started to drink at home. Bars were closing. And all these sales were shooting through the roof. And so I was thinking, “Hey, tequila's my favorite liquor of choice. Why not try and put this in a can and see what happens and see if we can make a company out of it?” Because there is that demand, and people will love it if it's a hit.
DMG: Besides the fact that you were on a gap year at Harvard, was there anything else, like any class that you took, that made you feel prepared to start this endeavor? Or was it more the pandemic that encouraged you to do this?
LWR: I would say more so the pandemic that encouraged me to do this. I still am Economics, but leading into the pandemic, it was just my freshman and sophomore year. And during those years, you're taking very standard Econ courses...Now in my junior and senior years, I have more freedom to take classes that'll help with the business, but I think it was more so seeing the pandemic, seeing the amount of time, and then seeing the vision for the brand that inspired me to do it.
DMG: If you could have any celebrity sponsor Kawama, who would it be and why?
LWR: Celebrity? Probably George Clooney. He started Casamigos, the regular tequila brand. He's always kind of been my favorite actor. One of my favorite movies is Ocean's 11...I love that movie. I think that'd be a really cool celebrity to sponsor Kwama.
DMG: How would you describe the experience of owning your own business?
LWR: It's a learning experience. You always have to be on your toes...I'm extremely grateful for it too, at the same time, just because there are things that I've learned that school can't teach you: dealing with real people and dealing with real businesses, and making real decisions with real money. That is something that an Econ class can't teach you, that a finance class can't teach you, because I'm dealing with the physical...and learning from mistakes, and getting better, which a classroom setting could not teach you.
DMG: If Kawama was a music genre, what genre would it be? Would it be EDM? Would it be country? How would you capture the ~vibes~ of the brand?
LWR: Definitely not EDM or country, probably going more so for tropical...I like the Beach Boys.
DMG: Where do you see Kawama positioned in social culture? Is it something that's a little bit fancier? Something that's more casual? Who's the best consumer for Kawama?
LWR: I think the flavor profile speaks to all age groups. When I was first starting out, the main focus of our target audience was college-aged kids bringing it to a party or bringing it to the beach with their friends – in a similar stance to High Noon, where it's a premium beverage, where it's real tequila, like High Noon is real vodka, whereas you have other malt liquors – and bringing a better tasting, better for you, beverage into that drinking culture with the other malt beverages that might not necessarily taste as good. But when I first started, the parents were saying, “Wow, I love this too.” So it really appeals to all age groups. And everyone.
DMG: Since Harvard-Yale's coming up, would you say that you're a bigger fan of Harvard-Yale or Yardfest?
LWR: That's definitely a tough question…I would say Harvard-Yale. I've never been able to go because of my athletic schedule, but I know that everyone loves it. And I'm much more of an athletic-space person. I love competition. I think Harvard-Yale is one of the best, if not THE best rivalry in the entire world. So it's gonna be awesome. And people are just going to be there to have a good time and support school spirit.
DMG: Will Kawama be at Harvard-Yale?
LWR: Kawama will be at Harvard-Yale to the fullest extent. I'm bringing a pickup truck, filling the bed with it. And I'll have flags, bucket hats, koozies, banners, and everything else. Everything out the wazoo. So we're going full force, and it's going to be a lot of fun.
DMG: Do you have any final ~words of wisdom~ for the Harvard community, whether it's starting your own business, balancing your schedule, or making the most of your time at Harvard? Is there anything in particular that you learned over the years that you think is important to share?
LWR: I think the most important thing is not being afraid to ask questions or ask for help. I think, you know, Harvard students, you're used to seeing the best...wherever you came from. And I found that during this entire process, the resources that we have here, and the connections, and the alumni network, just starting the conversation and asking questions, it's never going to do harm, and it's only going to open up doors for you.
