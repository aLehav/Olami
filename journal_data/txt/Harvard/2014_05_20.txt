After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Over 100 students and alumni, as well as two faculty members, at the Graduate School of Education signed a petition to rescind the invitation to Colorado State Senator Michael C. Johnston to address graduating students at the school’s 2014 convocation ceremony on May 28.
According to the online statement of protest, Johnston—who received a master’s degree from the Ed School in 2000—”embraces a vision of education reform that relies heavily on test-based accountability while weakening the due process protections of teachers.”
“We feel that the choice of Mike Johnston is emblematic of an institutional direction at HGSE [Graduate School of Education] that seems to value the voices of policymakers and researchers over those of teachers, students, and community members, which we find extremely troublesome,” the statement said.
A former teacher and principal, Johnston currently serves on the board of directors of New Leaders, a non-profit organization aimed at improving leadership at schools. As a state legislator, he helped spearhead SB 10-191, a Colorado law that mandates that 50 percent of an educator’s annual evaluation be based on a measure of student learning over time.
In an interview with The Crimson, Johnston said he intended to speak at the convocation ceremony despite the protest.
“I was honored to be invited to be the [convocation] speaker, and I’m even more excited to keep that commitment,” Johnston said. “I certainly plan to come and am looking forward to the conversation.”
Johnston also said that he plans to host an open forum before the ceremony to discuss his policies. He said he looks forward to talking to some of the students and alumni who disagree with his stance on certain education-related topics.
“For me, this whole process makes me more excited to come back to campus, not less excited. I think it reminds me of the great exchange of ideas that happen at Harvard, and that’s why people want to be there and that’s why I’m looking forward to coming back,” Johnston said.
Dean of the School of Education James E. Ryan released a statement Monday saying he would continue to support the choice of Johnston as convocation speaker.
“I do not believe that disagreement with some positions taken by a speaker is reason to rescind an invitation,” Ryan said. “To the contrary, it is precisely because there is debate about his positions that we should welcome the opportunity to hear from him.”
“I remain honored that Senator Johnston has accepted our invitation to speak,” he added.
In his letter, Ryan also said that inviting Johnston to speak does not necessarily imply institutional support of his policies.
Natalia V. Cuadra-Saez, a student at the School of Education who was involved in drafting and gathering signatures for the online petition, said that though the movement against Johnston’s speech may not be successful, she hopes that it will help to create more transparency in the process of choosing convocation speakers.
“Our interest is really in starting the conversation that has been started and in raising awareness about Michael Johnston and his record in education and the problems with that record, so our interest is definitely not in ruining anyone’s commencement or convocation,” Cuadra-Saez said.

The Q Guide, the College’s course and instructor evaluation system, will no longer publicly display course difficulty scores, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris wrote in an email to students Tuesday afternoon.
The Q Guide feedback form available at the end of each semester will still ask students to indicate how difficult they found their courses, but these ratings will only be communicated to the course head and instructional support staff, Harris wrote in his email.
The decision was officially made during a Faculty Council meeting on September 25, according to Secretary of the Faculty Susan L. Lively. She wrote in an email to The Crimson last week that the Faculty Council decided on the change last fall. At the time of her email, the College was in the process of implementing those changes, she wrote.
The Council also decided on several other minor changes to the evaluation system. The guide will now display the distribution of the Q results for a specific class without requiring students to click on the “details” link. By contrast, students will only be able to compare results from a specific course with a department’s “benchmark” data by clicking on the “details” link. Students will also have to report an exact number of hours they spent on a course per week as opposed to the range of hours, which students previously reported.
All of the changes will be implemented by the end of next semester.
Harris’ email said “these changes reflect the decisions of the Faculty Council that were intended to make the Q a more accurate, sophisticated, and helpful mechanism for learning about and choosing courses.”
Some members of the Faculty Council posited that the difficulty score was never a necessary component of the Q Guide and may have encouraged students to choose courses based on their rated difficulty instead of on other factors.
“[The difficulty score] could encourage students simply to use that criterion for choosing their courses,” said Classics professor Richard F. Thomas said in an interview prior to Harris’s announcement. “It could create an impulse in the instructor to make the course easier in order to attract students.”
Chinese History professor Mark C. Elliott added that he thinks most students and faculty members would agree that the difficult level of a course “is not really the most important thing about a class.”
“One hopes that after everything that our students have done up to the time they get admitted to Harvard...they recognize the value in a challenging curriculum and in taking courses that may not be an easy A, but will add in some way to their intellectual enrichment or development,” Elliott said in an interview last week.
In his email, Harris also asked students to think carefully about their pre-term planning choices in order to help the College most effectively assign teaching fellows to courses.

When Dave Griffin's date showed up at The Sinclair for her second date with Dave Griffin, what she didn't know was that besides her aforementioned suitor's genuine interest in her, he'd had other reasons for asking her out.
He would have done it anyway, Griffin said. And yet the only reason we know all these details about Dave Griffin and his unsuspecting date is that liking her was not his primary motivation for the first date; according to the Boston Globe, it was the promise of extra credit in his philosophy class.
As a student in Kerry Cronin's Boston College class, Griffin was simply carrying out the "script" for what's apparently known around campus as as "Cronin date." Cronin, a self-styled "relationship adviser" who is reportedly known at BC as the "dating doctor," has assigned dates as homework or extra credit in her classes for several years running.
After giving a talk on dating, Cronin realized that it's not that college students don't want to date, but rather that they just don't know how to ask each other out on dates. (Whether or not she's right on this point, we will leave for readers to decide in the comments below.) And so, like any good doctor, Cronin prescribed a cure for her patients, plagued, in this case, by hookup culture.
Cronin dates must follow a set of rules, some of them fairly reasonable—you must actually be interested in the person—and others, like not being able to tell them why you've asked them out, far sketchier. Also, there's no alcohol and no physical interaction except, in certain cases, a hug at the end. Definitely no kissing.
The rules are a nice idea probably meant to take the pressure off that first rendezvous and provide students with real practice going on dates in whose outcome they are truly invested. But it also seems likely that most people on the other end of things, if and when they find out about the premise of their first date, would find it just a little unsettling to have been, unknowingly, party to such a social experiment. (Put yourself in Dave Griffin's unnamed date's shoes when the article was published in the Globe, for example.)
What are we to glean from all this? For one, while courtship is probably dead, dating, it seems, may live on, at least among more motivated students. (N.B.: It might make a cute story if they live happily ever after, but a date completed for an assignment really does not constitute courtship.) Other potential takeaways are that grade inflation is not just a thing at Harvard, and that colleges these days can, at times, seem hell-bent on teaching us all kinds of skills that will likely not be of use in the real world, like writing by hand for three hours straight in final exams or asking people out face-to-face.
For his part, Griffin rather enjoyed doing his homework that fateful afternoon. “There was a general feeling of awkwardness but also accomplishment,” he told the Globe. Awkward, we'd guess, because of the whole asking his crush out for secret reasons aspect, and accomplished because, well, it worked. All best wishes to you, Dave Griffin and date.
