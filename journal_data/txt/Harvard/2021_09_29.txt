After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Swipe left. Swipe left. Swipe left. Swipe — hold on, she’s kinda cute. “I’m looking for the Jim to my -” Swipe left. Huh. Ok, she’s pretty cute. Sporty. Funny bio. MIT. Swipe right. Why not?
Bingo.
I don’t send a message right away; I can’t seem too eager. After an appropriate amount of time — as if that was determined by some Great Decider, handing down directives from Mount Sinai — I say something. After somewhere between how long you wait to respond to a text and how long before you send a follow-up email to your parent’s friend who’s helping you get that banking interview, I test the waters with an opening bit: a quick way to see if I’m wasting my time.
If I’m going to balance a full course load, extracurriculars, and logging time on the melange of dating apps available at my fingertips, I’m going to keep it interesting and, like any well-trained Harvard student, pursue efficiency at all costs.
To my delight, she clears the hurdle. She can hang. Let the banter ensue. Once there’s enough textual chemistry — as determined by the Great Decider’s cousin, the Sacred Chooser, we set a date, and the butterflies emerge from their slumber. After a sunny afternoon gallivanting from a vintage record shop — yes, liking classic rock is just a more efficient way of saying I have a good relationship with my father — to a hipster book nook, an afternoon ripped straight out of a romcom, I drive her home. We’re parked outside her dorm talking, and though I consider myself a perceptive, self-aware, and generally humble person, I have absolutely no idea if she wants me to kiss her.
I’ve seen enough movies and Electric Love TikToks to know what you might be thinking: just kiss her. As a man, I grew up being deeply ingrained with this notion of shooting your shot; of YOLO; of fortune favors the bold. Sure, if she doesn’t want me to kiss her, she’ll say something. And asking is exceedingly unsexy, right? Men don’t ask. They take what they want. “Don’t be a pussy.”
But that’s exceedingly shitty, right? The last thing I want to do is impose on another person; to make it so they’re kissed by someone they don’t want to be kissed by and have to uncomfortably communicate that, especially with the gender dynamics at play. Plus, I have to be careful given how I look. Think: a Jewish Winklevoss — Winkelstein, maybe. I've been warned too many times about inadvertently making myself the next straight, white man on the cultural chopping block. I’m not even on Twitter.
As I’m running through all of this, I realize I haven’t spoken in a while. I hear the Great Decider’s booming voice. It’s been too long. “Sometimes it's not that deep,” I think to myself and just ask her. She says yes — how couldn’t she (see above humility claim) — and I unbuckle my seatbelt as I attempt to move closer to her, dodging a large stick shift in the way that I don’t want to sit on. After a passionate but tasteful mini makeout session, she exits, and I drive back, an uncancelled king.
Cut to: a metaphorically appropriate spring. Flowers bloom in equal measure with our relationship. I weave her into the fabric of my life, at first carefully introducing her to starter friends before hemming her as one of the gang, an indelible thread throughout the semester’s memories.
Occasionally, I receive a drunk text from a dating app. “Come back to us,” they croon, craving my eyeballs, but hikes with her soon turn to hammocking in the Yard. She becomes part of my friend family and even meets my real one. Starting a college relationship in the spring is always tough because, to rip off Game of Thrones, Summer is Coming. To try the distance or to not try the distance? That is the question (I came up with that one on my own). Are three solid months enough credit in the bank to justify the opportunity cost? After all, what about hot boy summer?
Cautiously optimistic, we tried it. Neither one of us wanted to take a break. We were full steam ahead. Her week-long visit to Los Angeles left me sad and empty and found me at dinners I did not enjoy, wanting to recede into myself yet forced to play the host — always with a plan and a smile. It was an exercise in performance art Pagliacci would have tipped his curly wig to. By the end of that week, a once intoxicatingly beautiful lilac had withered, its petals now shriveling and falling to the ground beneath the unforgiving sun of a beckoning hot boy summer.
“Come back,” the chorus of dating apps sing in the small hours of the night.
While the Great Decider teaches us that those who initiate the breakup have to wait longer to get our fingers busy once again (not like that), hot boy summer was soon in full swing. With the apps still on my phone throughout the spring — collecting dust but whirring at a low, industrial pitch so I knew they were there — how could I let potential matches in the Greater L.A. area swipe on an outdated profile? Surely for their sake, I had to add a topical reference or maybe a recent picture. It would be dishonest to expose them to such inaccurate and erroneous information.
Not a week after the breakup, I open the app I had met my now ex on — feel free to assume it is the one you think is least gross — and see her still in my inventory of matches; one among dozens (86 to be exact), but who’s counting? Maybe out of curiosity, maybe out of guilt, maybe out of some kind of seller’s remorse, I tap her profile, and what’s this? A couple of new pictures? Already? My heart sinks in my chest.
“Must’ve meant a lot to her,” I think to myself, holding her to a different standard than that to which I intended to hold myself when I opened the app. And so, what am I to do? It hurts me to see, but if I unmatch, she would see that I unmatched, and I could come off as rude, or worse, hurt. We ended on good terms; I had no intention of hurting her more than I already had. Unmatching her would be rubbing salt into the wound.
How am I supposed to weigh the pain of seeing her change her profile while the corpse of our relationship was still warm against the hurt I might inflict by signaling that the relationship didn’t matter to me or the embarrassment I might feel if she thinks I am so upset that I couldn’t stand the pain of seeing her in my matches? Try explaining this distinctly modern problem to a Founding Father. They may not have had electricity or antibiotics, but they never had to deal with this.
Then there’s the whole other question: When can I update my profile? Right after she does? Three showers after she does? The Great Decider has yet to issue a decree on this subject, but with each day that passes, the sun inches closer to setting on hot boy summer.
Dating apps present us with hyper-optionality, which tantalize us with the thought of what could be out there, one or two or 15 swipes away. How I Met Your Mother explores this concept in the episode “Rabbit or Duck,” in which Neil Patrick Harris’s philandering Barney gets his number and an open invite for women to call him broadcast on TV during the Super Bowl. He becomes insatiable, driven insane by the thought of who could be out there calling him, of what might be better.
Mihir Desai, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School and professor of law at Harvard Law School, penned a provocative piece on the hazards of Harvard students’ obsession with professional optionality for The Crimson’s Commencement Issue in 2017.  According to Desai, rather than options, we should focus on alpha, which he describes as “macho finance shorthand for an exemplary life. It is the excess return earned beyond the return required given risks assumed. It is finance nirvana.” In a similar vein, the cadre of apps available to us grows by the quarter. How do we find happiness when corporations are trying to hijack our brains, rewarding us with surges of dopamine in just the right way at the thought of who could be on their sleek apps’ stacks of possible matches?
These apps are not made by people who love us, and we will never be happy if all we do is chase green grass.
The inter-connective capacity of modern technology presents us with an infinitely sprawling lawn. But how do you know? How do you know that the person you’re with is the right one? If your blissful three months of spring infatuation is worth sitting on the bench all summer? That the spot you’re in is sunny enough with just the right breeze? I don’t have an answer to that; only each one of us could possibly define what that means, but we should not kid ourselves by thinking that shareholder-driven and profit-conscious corporations don’t have a vested interest in keeping us searching.
They have perfectly engineered a system of ambiguous reward, creating a space into which we can project our own insecurities, follow our curiosity, and do so with incredibly low cost barriers. It’s intoxicating, the prospect of what could be right over the hill, a single tap away. And march along the grassy plains we shall.
Left foot. Right foot. Left swipe. Right swipe. That is, unless you stop.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The status of women at Harvard has come a long way since 1869, when University President Charles W. Eliot said in his inaugural address that “the Corporation will not receive women as students into the College proper, nor into any school whose discipline requires residence near the school.”
Radcliffe College for women officially became a chartered institution in 1894 with Elizabeth Cary Aggasiz as the College’s first president. Though Radcliffe’s admissions requirements were “identical with those for admission to Harvard College,” the women at Radcliffe still had many unstated admissions requirements, such as the need to be a proper lady: the implicit demand that they understand their lack of power and privilege in comparison to the men at Harvard. In other words, the Radcliffe women had to know their place. As Caroline Light, senior lecturer and director of undergraduate studies in Women, Gender, and Sexuality, described in an interview, “alongside the pedagogy that the women were getting in the classroom, there was the pedagogy that is social and cultural, that is about ‘what does it mean to be a good woman, an educated woman?’”
Though Radcliffe attempted to give women the education that they were not permitted at Harvard College, many components of Radcliffe — including the tension between Radcliffe and Harvard itself — still reinforced gendered oppression. Even the physical location and space of Radcliffe demonstrated this power imbalance, with the buildings of Radcliffe distant from that of Harvard’s, for fear that the men and women would interact improperly; in President Eliot’s same inaugural address, he said, “the difficulties involved in a common residence of hundreds of young men and women of immature character and marriageable age are very grave.”
Spaces inside Radcliffe also seem to reflect gendered assumptions of the time: Notably, the dorms of the Radcliffe Quadrangle (termed “The Quad” colloquially) seem to have disproportionately more kitchens than the male-occupied River Houses.
Historically, women have been relegated to the kitchen, with society — and famously, advertisements — telling them that their happiness or unhappiness in marriage, childcare, and life, in general, originated from the kitchen. It's especially curious that Radcliffe — the women’s college — had kitchens, and so many more than the River Houses at that. Radcliffe’s cooperative housing, the Jordan co-ops — now a part of Pforzheimer House — were notable for their student-run kitchens. However, these physical spaces may once have been sites of gendered expectations, particularly the expectation that women must be trained to be good facilitators of domestic bliss, first and foremost. As the Radcliffe College Report of the President 1961-1964 described, the co-ops — where “each student prepares her own breakfast and lunch” and “a team of two is responsible for cooking dinner each evening” — can be where “Harvard men appreciate the home-like atmosphere and non-institutional cooking” of the women. This rhetoric reinforces the gendered stereotype that a model Radcliffe woman must be one who can also please her male counterpart, particularly through cooking.
Currier House, another Quad House, opened in 1970 and boasts 52 kitchens. Curiously, Currier was built many years after the first Radcliffe residences were completed in 1937; perhaps the numerous kitchens in Currier were a response to the second-wave feminism in the 1960s.
Today, however, the kitchens in the Quad seem to occupy a different role in undergraduate life, as many students of all genders actually prefer to have a kitchen attached to their suite. As Hashem Abdou ’23-’24, who lives in Currier House, said in an interview, “the kitchen is a huge highlight in our suite, I mean it’s kind of a place where we all get together and have a quick bite.” Abdou also elaborated that “having a kitchen, in general, is very popular” and that “there are kitchens on every floor and in most cases more than one, especially in Currier specifically. Having a kitchen ensuite is less common, but it’s definitely not uncommon in the Quad.”
It’s fascinating how the kitchens — spaces that were so acutely gendered — have now been transformed into places of convenience and connection instead: friends bonding over a hastily-cooked meal, the convenience of being able to make a snack during an all-nighter. Perhaps this is representative of changing atmospheres surrounding once heavily gendered spaces, a hopeful sign that the kitchen — once so closely tied to femininity — can now be a more gender-neutral space.
Despite the inequality that many Radcliffe women faced during their time at the College, they still persisted and worked to make their institution better than how they found it. We should applaud their contributions to making the spaces of both Radcliffe and Harvard more palatable for the women that followed them.
As Kristina Pema ’24, a resident of Pforzheimer House, said in an interview, “A lot of history was kind of made here, and I think I feel a bit proud too for being here, like I’m a woman myself and I’m like ‘Oh, other women lived here before me, and they were still successful, and they literally made history.’”
Next time we happen upon a kitchen in the Quad, may we thank all of the Radcliffe women who were once limited by these spaces. Though there’s no way for us to cook them a meal ourselves and bid them thanks, we can still wish for future generations of women at Harvard to achieve their full potential — untethered by gendered limitations to their abilities to excel.

JPMorgan Chase will be the next big bank to cash in on Harvard Square, with a 5,000-square-foot branch slated to open in 2022.
The business will be housed at 9 JFK St. — across from CVS — and is part of a 60 branch expansion into New England that Chase announced in 2018, per JPMorgan Chase spokesperson Briana Curran. Currently, Chase’s only presence in the Square is an ATM in the Harvard Square MBTA station.
Chase’s Harvard Square location will join a host of other banks with branches in the neighborhood, including Bank of America, TD Bank, Citizens Bank, and Capital One, which opened a banking cafe in 2016 where customers can enjoy coffee from Peet’s and discuss their finances with associates.
Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said in an interview that the arrival of more banks was “inevitable,” even before the Chase announcement.
The HSBA and the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association partnered on a zoning petition passed by the Cambridge City Council in March 2020 that stipulated that banks could not occupy more than 25 feet of frontage in the area.
“We needed to work together to really keep the spirit of the Harvard Square Conservation District in mind, which was to have engaged, first-floor retail,” Jillson said.
“Chase will be welcomed here in Harvard Square, as all businesses are welcomed,” Jillson added. “We anticipated this, which is why we worked so closely with the Neighborhood Association to make sure that the zoning petition got passed.”
In recent years, stores have come and gone from the 9 JFK St. location, with some recent tenants including shoe stores, a lingerie store, and pop-up galleries. Now, the location — within the Abbot Building — is nearing the end of a large-scale renovation by real estate company Regency Centers Corporation. The Chase branch will have entrances on JFK and Brattle Streets, per Curran.
Other new Boston-area Chase branches — including locations in Wellesley, Waltham, and Framingham — are expected to open in the next year as part of the bank’s expansion plan.
“Harvard Square is a special place and we are very excited to be part of the community,” Curran wrote in an emailed statement.

Harvard Kennedy School professor Marcella M. Alsan ’99 was selected as a 2021 MacArthur Fellow on Tuesday for her work in health disparities at the intersection of medicine and economics.
Alsan, a physician-economist who joined the Harvard faculty in 2019, is the Kennedy School’s first female MacArthur Fellow and the sole Harvard faculty member among this year’s 25 recipients. The prestigious fellowship — also known as the MacArthur “Genius Grant” — comes with a $625,000 award paid out over five years for fellows to use at their discretion.
Alsan received the award in recognition of her work examining causes and solutions to racial discrepancies in health outcomes.
“My work focuses on two main questions — what are the origins of health inequalities and then what can be done to reduce them,” Alsan said in a HKS press release. “As an applied microeconomist, I endeavor to use rigorous methods to evaluate potential policy solutions and uncover mechanisms.”
Fellowships are awarded to individuals demonstrating “extraordinary originality and dedication in their creative pursuits and a marked capacity for self-direction,” according to the MacArthur Foundation website.
“Alsan is bringing powerful evidence to bear on the importance of diversity in the medical profession and on efforts to improve health outcomes for historically marginalized and mistreated populations,” the Foundation’s website states.
Alsan’s 2018 paper — one of her most notable works — examines the long-term effects of the Tuskegee syphilis experiments in rural Alabama between 1932 and 1972. Hundreds of Black men were denied treatment for the disease in an effort to track the condition’s full progression. The study was conducted without obtaining informed consent from participants.
Along with her co-authors, Alsan found a significant decrease in medical care use among older Black men in the region, including those not directly affected by the study. They also discovered increased mortality rates and mistrust of medical professionals.
The paper estimated that life expectancy at age 45 for Black men fell by up to 1.5 years, which the paper noted was “a remarkably large effect.”
The findings prompted Alsan and her colleagues to run a field study consisting of Black men in Oakland which found patients to be significantly more receptive to preventative care after meeting with a Black doctor.
Harvard Economics professor and Alsan’s dissertation adviser David M. Cutler ’87 said Alsan had a “deep drive” that allowed her to succeed in economics. Prior to earning her Ph.D. in economics from Harvard, Alsan obtained a medical degree and a masters degree in public health.
“She found the coursework difficult, but persevered through that to get to the research stage and has really done just phenomenally important research work,” Cutler said.
In the press release, Alsan said she is excited about the opportunity to out the grant money towards her future projects.
“I’m shocked and incredibly grateful to have my non-traditional path honored in such a tremendous way and am excited about the opportunities the grant affords,” Alsan said.
While the fellowship honors Alsan’s research prowess, Cutler also noted her “incredibly caring” nature.
“She's about the nicest person you'll ever meet, in addition to one of the smartest and most capable people you'll ever meet,” Cutler said.
“She's always there to lend an ear to talk to people, to provide advice,” Cutler added. “If there's something going on in life that's making life challenging for a student, she’ll say, ‘Let me see if I can help you, tell me what's going on.’”

Famed labor rights leader Dolores Huerta discussed her decades-long work in political organization and civil rights activism at a virtual event hosted by the JFK Jr. Forum and Kennedy School's Center for Public Leadership Tuesday.
The event — moderated by VICE News Correspondent and CPL Hauser Leader Paola Ramos— coincided with National Voter Registration Day, a holiday to created to promote awareness about voter registration and civic engagement.
Huerta, who co-founded the United Farm Workers Association in the 1960s with Cesar Chavez, said mass civic activism is necessary for change.
“We have a democracy in the United States, but the only way that democracy can work is if everybody participates,” she said.
Huerta also explained how political organizing works to solve the issues facing marginalized populations, citing her accomplishments in activism.
“We had one situation where the superintendent of schools was dipping into the money that didn't belong to him,” Huerta said. “Our committees were able to get some people elected to the school board and they finally got rid of them.”
“We find all of these things that are going wrong, and a lot of people don't know that they have the power to go to the school boards and say, ‘This is wrong,’” she added
Huerta also spoke about the obligation of the United States to provide aid to neighboring countries, referencing the current humanitarian crisis in Haiti.
“We in the United States should be reaching out to them and helping them in any way that we can,” Huerta said. “We are the richest country in the world. And yet, all of our neighbors to the south, instead of us uplifting them and helping them, we oppress them and take advantage of them.”
Huerta encouraged audience members to build coalitions and to not fear becoming involved in activism at all levels.
“It takes courage to reach out to people,” Huerta said. “But you can always start the conversation by saying, ‘Hey, don't you think that we should do something about climate change?’”
Even persuading a peer to call an elected official is a form of organizing, she argued.
“When you do that you get one person to call, then you become an organizer, you become an activist,” Huerta said.
She also urged activists — particularly those working on the issue of immigration reform — to persevere in their fight.
“We can never lose hope, because the only time that we lose is when we quit, and we're not going to quit,” she said. “We're going to keep going till we get it.”
Yet, Huerta — who has 11 children — acknowledged the sacrifices that are required of activists and their families.
“My kids are the ones who sacrificed because they didn't have the wonderful kind of an upbringing that I had,” she said. “What they got in return was experiences: adventures, meeting very famous people, being involved, and they grew up in a movement.”
“The one thing that you have to understand, when you are being an activist, you are making history,” Huerta added.

Medical leaders and professionals mulled strategies to counter racial disparities in health care in a Tuesday virtual forum hosted by the School of Public Health.
Harvard Opinion Research Program Assistant Director Mary G. Findling, Harvard Medical School Director of Health Equity Education Alden Landry, Rush University Medical Center Senior Vice President David A. Ansell, and the Commonwealth Fund Vice President for Health System Equity Laurie C. Zephyrin all spoke at the event.
Nicholas St. Fleur, a reporter at STAT and the discussion’s moderator, kicked off the event by describing how the Covid-19 pandemic has amplified racial inequalities in the health care system.
“Covid-19 is shining a light on health inequity, exacerbating long-standing health disparities, and forcing Americans to confront a legacy of medical mistrust born of generations of racism and bias,” Fleur said. “Whether we’re talking about Covid-19, maternal health, or cancer screening, the fact is that people of color often have a very different experience of the health care system.”
Findling shared insights from a recent poll organized by the Harvard Opinion Research Program in partnership with the Commonwealth Fund illustrating the prevalence of racism for patients of color in the United States. The poll found that, among the roughly 1200 households surveyed, 36 percent and 35 percent of Black and Latino households, respectively, had experienced some form of racial or ethnic discrimination in their medical care in the past year.
Findling said that racism in the health care industry extends beyond specific situations and encompasses the system as a whole. She cited several health care locations — including pharmacies, urgent care centers, and private clinics — where race can negatively impact patient experiences.
“This is not just happening at the ER, this is not just happening at a neighborhood health clinic,” she said. “One in 10 and one in 12 Black and Latino patients reported discrimination at any different types of these providers, really underscoring for us how widespread this problem is in health care delivery.”
“It’s occurring everywhere,” Findling added.
Landry noted the importance of weighing both quantitative data and patient stories to achieve a complete picture of racial inequities in the health care system. He recounted a formative interaction from his early career where, after eight hours of waiting for medical care, a Black patient asked Landry why all the Black patients were placed in the main hallway, the busiest area of the hospital.
“It was the first time that I, who was a part of the health care system — where I was caring for patients in the hallway, where I was caring for patients throughout the emergency department — actually stopped to realize that I was operating within a system that was showing bias against certain patient groups,” Landry said.
Panelists concluded the forum with an overview of strategies to improve medical training for future generations of health care professionals. Landry underscored the importance of guiding students to a comprehensive understanding of the racial underpinnings of health, disease, and care.
“Medical education needs an overhaul where health equity needs to be ingrained within the culture of medical education,” he said.
Landry added that in discussions with medical trainees, there needs to be a reckoning with the structural racism associated with diseases and their treatments.
“When we’re having a discussion, not only do we talk about the disease and pathophysiology, but we also talk about the structural racism that’s linked to the disease, we talk about the inequities that are associated with the disease, we talk about the social determinants of health that are associated with the disease,” Landry said.

Ten Asian American alumni gifted more than $45 million to expand the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’s Asian American studies program, the FAS announced on Tuesday.
The donations will endow new professorships and graduate fellowships, as well as fund academic research in the field. The expansion is part of an FAS-led push to bolster the study of ethnicity, indigeneity, and migration at Harvard.
“We are thrilled to support Harvard’s long-term commitment to the field of Asian American studies and [FAS] Dean [Claudine] Gay’s vision to advance racial justice by attracting exceptional faculty and students to Harvard,” hedge fund manager Joseph Y. Bae ’94 and writer Janice Y. K. Lee ’94, who led the initiative, said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
“Harvard’s leadership in this important area of scholarship is absolutely critical in helping society understand the full breadth of the Asian American experience, its many unique struggles, and the significant contributions Asian Americans have made in shaping our country,” Bae and Lee continued.
In response to a rising wave of anti-Asian violence this past spring, Gay said in an April interview with The Crimson she planned to “take this moment and use it to pursue durable change” by expanding and diversifying the FAS faculty and curriculum.
“I do believe very strongly that this is a struggle that belongs to all of us, and that we have a role to play, in particular, in fighting the false narratives that drive racist violence,” Gay said.
The donation comes as a move to hire three to four senior faculty specializing in ethnic studies — first announced in June 2019 — has lagged. The cluster hire of faculty is meant to boost efforts to establish a formal ethnic studies program, a longtime priority for activists.
Nonetheless, groups advocating for ethnic studies programs applauded the program’s expansion. Jeannie Park ’83, president of the Harvard Asian American Alumni Alliance, wrote in an emailed statement that she hopes the gift “inspires other alumni to fund Ethnic Studies.”
“After nearly 50 years of student and alumni activism that made clear the academic need, a missing piece for Asian American Studies and Ethnic Studies at Harvard was the funding,” Park wrote.
“Of immediate concern, we hope this helps persuade scholars of Harvard’s commitment to building a serious Ethnic Studies program,” she continued.
Harvard spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven declined to comment on the donation’s relation to the broader cluster hire.
Jane S. Bock ’81 of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni group that pushes for diversity and equity at the University, applauded the gift as “change-making,” but reiterated the group’s goals.
“We look forward to Harvard committing similar resources to Latinx, Native American, and Muslim American Studies,” Bock wrote in an emailed statement. “And we call on Harvard to urgently address the structural problems that have impeded its Ethnic Studies scholars in the past.”
Thuan H. Tran ’23, a spokesperson for the undergraduate groups Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition and Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies, wrote the organizations were “grateful for the hard work of the alumni who made this gift a reality.”
“Learning our histories is the first step to correcting the structures which materially shape the Asian American experience, now and in the future,” they wrote, adding that the funding must create space for “communities [that] have been historically excluded or disadvantaged even within the Asian American community.”
“We demand that the University provide the critical infrastructure for Ethnic Studies scholars—including those who would be hired through this funding—to thrive at Harvard, starting with a financial commitment by the university to establish a department,” Tran added.

Though the College is back in person this fall, some campus spaces remain temporarily closed or have reduced hours due to staff shortages and Covid-19 restrictions, frustrating the students who patronize them.
Most of Harvard’s popular cafés — including Barker, Bauer, Cabot, Gato Rojo, and Lamont — and House Grilles at Dunster, Eliot, Pforzheimer, Quincy, and Winthrop Houses are temporarily closed.
Recreational facilities, including the Quadrangle Recreational Athletic Center and Hemenway Gymnasium, as well as the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center’s Collaborative Commons, are operating with reduced hours.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that student-operated facilities, such as cafés and House Grilles, are reviewing Covid-19 safety standards. She added that Harvard will determine a reopening timeline for House Grilles once it completes additional hirings and training.
Dane also cited labor shortages as the cause of the QRAC and Hemenway Gym’s reduced hours and wrote that the facilities are “making every effort to staff up and return to full operation this semester.”
The QRAC opens at 4 p.m. every day and closes at 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 9 p.m. on the weekends.
Parker P. Hamilton ’24 said the QRAC’s reduced hours create a “very limited window” for him to work out.
“When I go there after I eat dinner and it’s busy, it’s really a big driving factor that turns me away,” he said.
Nathaniel A. “Nate” DeLucca ’24, a resident of Pforzheimer House, said he prefers to work out early in the morning or late at night, which “basically takes the QRAC out of the equation.”
“Mainly, I just stay in the Pfoho gym,” he said. “It’s small and very old, but it’s nice because there’s not a whole lot of people in there.”
The Smith Campus Center’s Collaborative Commons now closes at 10 p.m., though it was previously open 24/7, including for a brief period at the start of the semester.
Carol J. Cao ’23 said the earlier hours at the Commons are “unfortunate.”
“Collaborative spaces are very difficult to find nowadays,” she said. “I’ve been resorting to going to the d-halls.”
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that Harvard moved the Commons’ hours to 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. due to “overcrowding and mask noncompliance, particularly during the overnight hours.”
“We hope to return the Collaborative Commons to a 24/7 schedule in the future,” she wrote.
Cao said she is also disappointed that many cafés are closed, citing her inability to use BoardPlus — the financial credit the College provides undergraduates each semester to spend at select dining locations.
“We do have $65 of BoardPlus, of which a single cent I have not spent because all of those cafés have been closed,” she said.
Lauren C. Baehr ’24 said the closure of Lamont Café is a “bummer.”
Kevin Tan ’23-’24 said buying food from the Winthrop Grille late at night was one of his favorite parts of campus life and that he looks forward to its reopening.
“I miss the grille so much,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Upon the return to campus, students and faculty showed mixed reactions about the transition back to in-person classroom labs.
Julia Espeso, the lab manager for Gen Ed 1104: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science,” said Covid-19 safety measures in the classroom have detracted from the overall class experience.
“Science and Cooking is a place for students to eat their own labs — that’s part of the curriculum, we want students to eat what they’re creating, and of course, we can’t do that in the lab,” Espeso said. “We’re kind of missing that big part of all of us enjoying what we just created together.”
Despite the limitations, Espeso pointed to the class’s high enrollment compared to previous years as evidence that students are actively looking for lab experiences that are “hands-on.”
“I think students have received it — they’re well aware that we’re doing what we can to offer them the best experience possible — so I think they’re enjoying it a lot,” Espeso said.
Joao Pedro “JP” Vieira ’22 said he prefers being back in the classroom for labs because it was difficult to absorb material while learning remotely and that an in-person, hands-on experience is the “best way to learn.”
Ye Rim “Grace” Chang ’22 echoed her preference for hands-on learning in her class, Life Sciences 2: “Evolutionary Human Physiology and Anatomy.”
“I’m really glad that we’re in-person because a lot of it is dissecting,” Chang said. “When you have it right in front of you and you’re able to touch it, you could definitely learn better.”
Vieira pointed out the convenience of doing labs online, however, as an advantage of virtual learning over in-person instruction.
“It takes less time, it’s less of a thing you have to walk to and be in-person,” Vieira said. “I think being in-person just takes a lot more energy out of you.”
Chang also argued that participating in labs virtually saved lots of time and noted that a virtual format made visual observations in experiments more apparent, which was beneficial to her learning.
“You can just fast forward the reaction and see it dramatically change the colors and it’s a really cool thing to watch, instead of standing there for 30 minutes and seeing that gradually change,” Chang said.
Chang added that doing lab experiments virtually allowed her to worry less about details and “being super meticulous,” and that she could instead focus on understanding why students were conducting the lab.
With the benefits of virtual labs in mind, Dean of Science Christopher W. Stubbs said Harvard’s Board of Overseers and the Science Education Office are discussing the question of what aspects of virtual learning could be applied in the return to in-person work.
“What lessons did we learn from the pandemic experience that can be applied to the in-person component of what we do at Harvard?” he said.
Stubbs said organizing virtual lab experiences over the past year forced the faculty to reckon with questions of equitable access and diversity.
“The conversation with the overseers, I think interestingly, rapidly turned to how much the faculty learned about the diversity of our student body, and the extent to which having people come to campus goes partway — but not all the way — to leveling the playing field and preparing people to step up and be active learners on campus,” Stubbs said.
Stubbs added that the virtual academic year helped students and faculty to connect in new ways.
“I think in some ways, the experience of encountering one another over Zoom from our respective homes put us more in touch with people as fellow humans than I think is the case when we all walk into the classroom together,” Stubbs added. “I hope that’s a spirit that we can carry forward into everything that we do together.”

In front of a raucous crowd of 20,748 at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson started fast and never looked back. After building a 42-0 halftime lead, Harvard would go on to a 49-17 victory over Brown in its Ivy League opener and first home game since 2019. The Crimson's triumph would also be head coach Tim Murphy's 180th career win, a new Ivy League record that earned the Harvard bench boss a Gatorade shower at the game's end.

Dear Harvard Rats (the animals, not the snitches),
I’ve been in Cambridge for more than a month now but have not seen much of you in a long time. I guess now that I’m at the Quad you don’t feel like paying me a visit, but surprises are always nice. I remember the days at Mather during my freshman year where you would run against the prison walls in sync like secret agents in the shadows. The fateful day that one of you paid me and my suitemate a visit in our common room was one of the most eventful days I had in the pandemic era at Harvard.
I know this is controversial, but I miss you. I miss the fight or flight that flushed through my body as you searched for food in any Harvard Square trash can. I miss the fear that both you and I felt when we were in proximity to each other, like a playful game of hide-and-seek. I miss the nights where I would catch a glimpse of your long-haired concrete fur, make eye-contact with you, and then we would just give each other a little cheeky smile. Those are the memories I cherished most as a first-year.
Times have changed since then. I heard you don’t really come out too much since there are more people out. I get it. It can be an overwhelming change. Just know that if you ever do find yourself taking one of those long and lonely college-student midnight walks, I would join you in an instant. Who knows, maybe after reading this you’ll finally text me back, and if not, that’s okay too (it’s not). I get you’re, you know, constantly trying to survive and all.
Whether or not you believe it, I really care about you. When I saw you in my common room, I never bought a rat trap or rat poison. I will admit that clogging the hole from which you would enter was a little cruel, but I should have known that rats at Harvard are smart enough to chew through cardboard boxes if it means getting a warm and cozy place to sleep for the night.
Even after the encounter we had where you ran under one of our couches to hide, I never thought about anything less than welcoming you into my Harvard College experience. I know there you will never read this—considering you cannot read or understand the complex linguistics of the English language—but if one day you find a way to fluently read, write, and speak English using some amazing product like Duolingo, or at least understand humans like Remy from Ratatouille, I hope this letter somehow finds its way to you and makes you smile. But until then, just keep on doing your thing and don’t die.
Happy Trails,
Edgar “Teddy” Onate
P.S. This letter is not sponsored by Duolingo
