After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Piñatas, komodo dragons, a dog that turns into a human: These wacky sights, among others, will take the stage at Farkas Hall this weekend during Harvard’s production of Naomi Iizuka’s 1999 comedy “Aloha, Say the Pretty Girls.” The production—the Theater, Dance, and Media senior thesis project of director Matthew H. Munroe ’17—[hopes][AIMS] to both entertain and inspire college audiences.
The play follows ten 20-somethings on a journey to such varied settings as Alaska, Hawaii, New York City, and Inner Borneo to find their identities and discover love. Characters like ambitious young writer Derek, hopeful divorcée Vivian, and aforementioned dog-turned-human Martin all come together in this ensemble comedy to try and find with whom they belong—and in the process, themselves.
Munroe has a long and rather personal history with the play: “I first read it two-and-a-half years ago for a summer program I did, and I thought it was a really bizarre play. But then I came back to it in my junior tutorial, and I began to understand that it was about finding identity and belonging in a world of constant change,” he says. “That’s a theme that really resonated with me personally, because I’ve been struggling with identity and questions about that throughout my college career, and I think that’s the way a lot of college students are: independent, away from home.”
“Aloha,” according to Munroe, is important for exactly that reason. “I thought this would be a great show to do at Harvard because it is so relevant and relatable to a college community, and I thought it was great for my thesis because every time I read the show, I discovered something new,” he says. “So I knew there was a lot of depth to the show that I could delve into and explore as part of my thesis.”
For[ stage manager Emily Oliveira ’18, that depth is ingrained in the play: “The only punctuation, for example, in all of the lines are the commas written between fragments…. The letter ‘I’ is never capitalized; proper nouns are never capitalized. It’s just sort of that mental jumble that has now been translated onto paper.” For Oliveira, these quirks only add to the fun of the play. “I think the play is attractive in that respect, just as something can be very real without being polished in the way you’d think a full-length production might have to be,” she says.
Michael T. Shirek ’20, who plays Derek, says he drew on his own experiences to surmount the unique challenges of the production. “It’s a lot of drawing off of experiences you’ve had where you weren’t sure what you wanted, whether it’s not knowing which concentration you want to pursue [or] maybe not even knowing what school you’re going to go to,” he says.
Actor Geoffrey G. Binney ’17 faced a unique challenge in portraying another species. “Part of playing a dog has been trying to find the entertaining moments of situations that I wouldn’t have thought of as being entertaining,” he says. “There’s definitely a benefit to looking at things from a different perspective.”
Of course, any play with a barking dog as a primary character might be expected to contain copious amounts of humor, and according to Shirek, “Aloha” is a production anyone can relate to. “Maybe you just want to come and have a good laugh on a Friday night, or maybe you want to find comfort in knowing that everyone faces the struggles you do,” he says. “Everyone can find something in the play.”
“It’s definitely a comedy and there’s a lot of bizarre, zany things that happen that are just really fun,” Munroe concludes. “And also I hope that many college students will be able to relate to it rather than just being entertained…. This play will be a reminder that you can find the right path eventually, but it’s often about the journey you take to get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Was Hillary Clinton the woman with the best odds of winning a presidential election? Some certainly seem to think so. The Guardian ran a story a few days prior to the election titled, “Did it have to be Hillary Clinton for president? Yes. Here’s why.” That view has an uncomfortable implication—namely that no other woman could have beaten Donald Trump. MSNBC’s Jonathan Alter came to the same conclusion when he claimed that Trump won “because he's a testosterone candidate and men weren't ready for a woman president.”
But that seems misguided. Clinton’s supporters were right that she was well qualified for the presidency, even without comparison to her exceedingly unfit opponent. But one must not conflate suitability for the job with strength as a candidate. As John Dickerson, the host of CBS's “Face the Nation,” put it, Clinton’s skills are much better suited for governing than for running for office. “I think she's just not a very good campaigner,” he said in an interview a few months ago. Even Clinton herself has admitted as much. In a primary debate in March, when asked why voters do not see her as honest and trustworthy, Clinton replied, “I am not a natural politician, in case you haven’t noticed, like my husband or President Obama.” Whether her fans like it or not, Clinton did have a Hillary problem.
Many hoped that Clinton would become America’s first woman president. Now that she is not, it is important that we remember why, so that other qualified women in the future are not unintentionally shut out of the highest office in the land. I am worried that if Clinton is incorrectly viewed as an exceptional presidential nominee, Democratic primary voters, come January 2020, may feel that it is too risky to nominate a woman again, based on the mistaken belief that the best possible female candidate had already run—and lost—four years earlier. They may reason that it is somehow safer to nominate a man, perpetuating the endless wait for a woman president. This is why the idea of “Clinton exceptionalism” must be rejected.
In what ways did Clinton fall short as a campaigner? As she has alluded to herself, she has neither the retail politics skills of her husband, nor the oratory gifts of Obama. But there are also the factors of likability and perceived honesty. A survey from March 2008, during that year’s primary elections, found that 63 percent saw Obama as honest and trustworthy, while only 44 percent said the same of Clinton.
It is true that women who run for political office face severe challenges that men do not, given the pervasiveness of sexism in so many dimensions of our everyday lives. There is often a different standard, a higher bar, that female candidates must clear. Clinton’s figures are certainly worse because of her gender alone, but she does not stack up well even against other woman politicians. As Secretary of State, while having high job approval, Clinton often still had higher unfavorability ratings than her predecessor Condoleezza Rice.
A look at 43 polls conducted from 2001 to 2008, while she was a senator from New York, shows that Clinton had an average favorable/unfavorable spread of just 5 percent—in other words, the share of voters who viewed her favorably, as opposed to unfavorably, was only 5 percentage points larger. By contrast, Kirsten Gillibrand, who took over Clinton’s seat in the Senate, has had a favorable/unfavorable spread of around 21 percent since taking office, based on 45 different polls.
Even as First Lady, Clinton seemed to struggle more with public perception than what is typical. Shortly after her husband’s inauguration, in the spring of 1993, Gallup found that Clinton had a 61/27 favorable/unfavorable rating. When Gallup polled Michelle Obama’s favorability in the spring of 2009, her rating, by contrast, was 72/17.
Running for office is different from running a government. Sadly, as witnessed on November 8, the candidate best suited to do the job does not necessarily get picked. But there is a silver lining: Since Clinton, despite not being good at campaigning, lost only narrowly to Trump, the odds look very promising of shattering that highest glass ceiling in four years’ time, if the Democrats nominate a woman who both has the qualifications and the skills to run a stronger campaign.
In four years, the liberals’ top priority will obviously be to dethrone Trump, regardless of whom is chosen to lead the charge against him. At the same time, would it not be the perfect celebration of the 19th Amendment’s 100th anniversary to have the first woman president replace a sexist, misogynistic bigot in the White House?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As students of a liberal college in Massachusetts, we understand the thought process behind Hampshire College’s decision to lower the American flag after the election to discuss "deeply held beliefs about what the flag represents to the members of our campus community." In the election's aftermath, students at Hampshire, Harvard, and beyond have felt that the country has become a more hostile environment for them simply due to their identities.
Nevertheless, we also understand the backlash that the decision fomented: Many Americans view the flag with a certain reverence owed to the sacrifices made to protect our freedoms. As a result, we are especially heartened by the dialogue spurred by the protest of Hampshire’s flag-lowering and are encouraged by the ensuing reflections of Hampshire College President Jonathan Lash and New England Veterans Alliance founder Derek Cloutier, who both came away from the protest more aware of both sides’ perspectives.
By contrast, there is a third perspective on this issue which takes flag reverence too far and which threatens civil liberties.  President-elect Donald Trump’s recent tweet calling for flag-burners to be jailed or to even to lose their citizenship is perhaps the most alarming example of this viewpoint. While the constitutionality and feasibility of such a proposal is suspect to say the least, we must take Donald Trump’s rhetoric seriously, especially in light of his cabinet picks and the emotions unleashed by his victory. Trump was nominated, at least in part, on an anti-political correctness platform, maintaining that political correctness stifles free speech and keeps important conversations from occurring. Ironically, his latest controversial tweet suggests that the President-elect applies a double standard on one of his signature issues.
Such censorious nationalism is not new. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also supported the banning of flag-burning in 2005, but we stand against that instinct now just as we would have stood against it then. Flag-burning, just like Hampshire’s lowering of the flag and the veterans’ protest, is an inherently political act and is a healthy part of democracy. Censoring those who purportedly disrespect the flag—and punishing dissenters in general—would have prevented the conversation and reflection seen at Hampshire College. For Trump to charge that Americans have become too politically correct to have certain conversations and then invoke nationalistic patriotic correctness to censor others is hypocrisy of the first order.
defense of his vote to hold flag-burning to be protected under the First Amendment in the 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson: “If it were up to me, I would put in jail every sandal-wearing, scruffy-bearded weirdo who burns the American flag. But I am not king.” Protest is a vitally important part of our political system, and the right to do so must be held sacred, just as Scalia argues. Regardless of one’s opinion of the topic, one must allow dissenting opinions in order to foster mutual growth through conversation.  Active proponents of free speech—especially those who found Trump’s stance compelling—should strive to remember this.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over the past few weeks, I’ve heard the following sentiment expressed so many times I am convinced it has become a campus catechism—to go into finance or consulting is to “sell out,” to smother the soul of the budding scientist or diplomat we believe dwells in each of our deepest heart of hearts. To be noble at Harvard is to go to med school, join the Peace Corps, or sign up for a two-year stint at Teach For America. My aim in this editorial is to convince you that this narrow conception of a “good” career and the dichotomies we construct between noble and ignoble paths are not only unfounded but opposed to the trajectory of social progress.
Let’s first take a look at where the dominant attitude on campus comes from. The answer is obvious: 2008. The financial crisis took place during what was for most of us at Harvard College now our “formative years.” Consequently, we are disposed to think of bankers and hedge fund managers as the primary villains in the cosmic struggle of Wall Street versus Main Street.
This attitude is not entirely off the mark. Especially during the last decade, unprincipled bad actors have had an outsized impact on the livelihoods of “innocent bystanders” who had no interest in playing the dangerous game of financial roulette.
But there is another side to the story as well. Without efficient systems of creating and allocating debt, the technological innovations that lead to human progress could never be financed. But this is old news. Luckily, there is some new news you may not have heard about yet, and it is very exciting.
For the past few decades, the driving trend has been towards a new model of “philanthrocapitalism,” at the heart of which is a vision of cross-sector collaboration. The social sector is no longer like water to the oil of the private sector, but rather a highly efficient, constantly improving hybrid. Gone are the days of the uninspired, pedantic social worker who is basically a missionary in his ideological rigidity. Enter the philanthrocapitalists: business leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet who take their private sector expertise in managing organizations, developing technologies, and delivering outcomes to the realm of social good. 
Over the course of the next quarter of a century, we will see business do for philanthropy what science has done for medicine. Just as modern scientific methods allowed for the measurement of health outcomes and rapid improvement of treatment processes, so will private sector expertise empower social good-motivated organizations to generate outsized impact with their finite resources.
Take the example of The Nature Conservancy, America’s largest environmental conservation organization with $6.7 billion in assets as of 2015. A few decades ago, TNC started out with a very simple business model, using their cash to direct purchase large tracts of land to dedicate to conservation, a solid strategy we might characterize as “get-what-you-pay-for.” But even billions of dollars can only buy so much land, and TNC’s goal is to create enduring, system-level change.
Two years ago, The Nature Conservancy created an impact investing division called NatureVest. The group of merely 20 financial professionals has processed $200 million in deals over the past 2 years for projects like creating flood insurance programs for at-risk communities in the United States and restructuring the national debt of Seychelles to protect vulnerable marine and coastal ecosystems. Perhaps surprising to you may be that JP Morgan contributed a significant part of their seed capital.
Another example of a philanthrocapitalism best practice is aligning private and public interests. Over the past decade, macroeconomic trends have compressed yields and interest rates close to or, in some cases, even below zero. The sudden evaporation of “easy money” puts many of the world’s largest pension and sovereign wealth funds at risk of insolubility in the near future. An initiative called Bretton Woods II sees opportunity in this turbulence. By using financial analysis and tools to advocate for redistribution of capital to social impact investments that address the fundamental drivers of volatility, they deliver superior risk-adjusted returns over time. Their board of directors includes a former managing director at Citigroup and a consultant at McKinsey. But it also includes an ex-Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer and a nonprofit CEO.
The lesson here is clear. Progress on solving the world’s most difficult problems not only allows for but utterly depends on the collaboration of the best and the brightest across all sectors. The social sector needs the private sector like the human body needs the nervous system: to allocate resources, to coordinate, to learn and improve.
What this means for students at Harvard College is a growing abundance of opportunities to do good and do business at the same time. This year, my initiative at the Social Innovation Collaborative, called Impact Fellows, created 15 internships to place Harvard students at innovative companies like The Nature Conservancy, NatureVest, and the Gates Foundation that are applying private sector methods to social sector problems. The vision is that by creating opportunities to gain exposure to the cutting edge of the social sector, we will prepare our generation for the mode of cross-sector leadership that society needs. And so I ask you not to sell out, but to buy in.

To the Editor:
We read your Nov. 22 article "Harvard Admissions Officers Rarely Consider Applicant’s Social Media" and your Nov. 30 editorial "An Important Social Media Admission." Both mention our company, Social Assurity, and we would like to comment on them and set the record straight.
Social Assurity’s mission is to teach students an essential 21st century skill: how to use social media in an expressive, engaged and authentic manner that will effectively represent their true selves to others. We never advise students to “fabricate” their social media presence, and we never sell expensive advice on how to carefully curate a fake presence, as your editorial suggests. What we do recommend is that aside from their peer-to-peer social media usage, students also use LinkedIn and Twitter to expand their network of influencers, discover like-minded people, and to document their interests, achievements, aspirations, and service. We are also a needs-based business and have proudly and widely donated our time and expertise to help disadvantaged students achieve their academic dreams.
We support the initiatives advanced by Harvard's Making Caring Common project and by the Coalition for Access, Affordability & Success of which Harvard is a founding member. We believe in evolving and rationalizing the college admissions framework to make it more open and less stressful. Social media recruiting and vetting is a phenomenon that we didn’t invent. We just try to help people understand it.
President Faust once offered the following advice to parents of Harvard hopefuls: "Make your children interesting!”  Social media provides an inexpensive and effective medium for applicants to convey rich and authentic information while enabling colleges to make more informed decisions about their character, values and commitment. Just ask your own Dean of Admissions.

Sparks flew between President-elect Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s respective campaign managers Kellyanne Conway and Robby Mook during their first public appearance together since Election Day, as the two dissected the results of the presidential election and faced pointed questions from the audience.
The discussion, moderated by CNN anchor Jake Tapper, was the featured event of a two-day conference on the 2016 presidential campaign at the Institute of Politics. The Washington Post reported contentious interactions between members of the Trump and Clinton campaigns at IOP panel events earlier on Thursday.
At an earlier event, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri accused Stephen K. Bannon—a top Trump adviser and Business School graduate—of inciting racism during the campaign, the Post reported Thursday evening. Palmieri also seemed to accuse Bannon, the former executive chair of Breitbart News, of “providing a platform for white supremacists.” Bannon was also initially slated to attend the IOP conference this week, but a Kennedy School spokesperson said Tuesday he would not be coming.
Student questions, which were pre-approved by the IOP, largely dealt with controversies during the Trump campaign.
“As a woman, how do you respond to criticism that President-elect Trump is misogynist?” Melia C. Henderson ’19 asked Conway.
“I know he’s not a misogynist,” Conway said. “I think people were very quick to cherry-pick a comment or an alleged incident here or there.”
Conway expressed disdain at some of the audience’s questions about Bannon, connections between the Trump campaign and the “Alt-right”—a movement associated with white nationalism—and Trump's proposed ban on Muslim immigration.
“To associate [Trump] with the most hateful elements of the nation,” Conway said, “I think is naive and unfair.”
The crowd also erupted into shouts when Conway accused the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit legal advocacy organization focusing on hate groups, of being an “anti-Trump organization.”
At one point, Mook attempted to shift the conversation from controversial remarks made by Clinton in September, in which she called many Trump supporters “a basket of deplorables,” to Trump’s divisive rhetoric. Conway interrupted.
“That’s what they do,” she said, referencing Mook’s change of subject.
“You both do it,” Tapper countered.
“Yes, but we won,” Conway said, smiling.
During the discussion, which lasted almost 90 minutes, Conway touched upon topics ranging from FBI Director James Comey’s letter regarding Clinton’s emails to the 2005 video of Trump bragging about groping women, and even private moments between the campaign managers and candidates.
Mook blamed Comey’s letter about a renewed review into Clinton’s email practices for torpedoing the campaign just over a week before the election.
“What happened? What went wrong?” Tapper asked Mook.
“We were expecting to perform better with suburban women,” Mook said. “We think that was because of the Comey letter.”
Conway countered, claiming that Clinton ran a “joyless” campaign.
The discussion in its entirety will air on CNN’s State of the Union with Tapper on Dec. 4.

UPDATED: December 2, 2016, at 12:56 a.m.
Nine of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential Houses are planning winter formal dances this weekend, and most are teaming up to throw bigger bashes in Boston.
Around 1,750 attendees will descend on the House of Blues in Boston Sunday night as Quincy, Winthrop, Currier, Pforzheimer, and Cabot Houses, for the first time, are combining efforts for "QWinter Formal" at the famed venue.
Leverett, Dunster, and Mather Houses will host the "Rue Royale" formal Sunday at Royale nightclub in Boston, while the Adams House Committee will host an "Enchanted Forest Formal" Saturday back in Cambridge in the House.
“There’s really been a recent push to do more activities with our neighborhoods, which I’ve been a fan of,”  Mather House Committee co-chair Trevor A. Mullin ’17 said.  “If you look at our joint Yardfest events, our Harvard-Yale tailgates, I think that those have been successful for getting together with not only your blockmates but also your linkmates.”
Quincy House Committee co-chair Brittany L. Wang ’17 said tickets for the five-house QWinter Formal were not restricted to only residents of the host Houses, and have sold out. Wang said 250 tickets were earmarked for residents of the host Houses and one additional guest, and an additional 500 tickets were available online for all undergraduates.
Wang said she hoped the size of the event would drum up more enthusiasm about House life. “I think the House of Blues is such a pinnacle point of Boston. We’re hoping this gets people more excited about House social events,” Wang said.
Wang said reasons for combining House formals included driving down the cost and being able to afford the House of Blues as a venue. In addition, Mullin said, being able to divide up organizational tasks among multiple Houses made planning more efficient.
The committee also hoped that by having multiple Houses involved, the QWinter Formal would garner a larger turnout and attract friend groups across Houses, Wang said.
While the QWinter Formal will be a new endeavor, Leverett, Dunster, and Mather House Committees have been teaming up for years.
“It’s kind of a tradition of recently,” Mullin said. “With any off-campus event, partnering with other Houses is kind of essential because the cost of the venue would not be feasible for one House Committee to take on from their budget.”
Adams House will take a different tack, hosting its in-House formal alone to to keep down costs.
“Adams has a long and proud history of in-house formals,” Adams House HoCo co-chair Cecilia Laguarda ’17 wrote in an email. “We maintain that throwing a formal in the House is the most inclusive way to do it. This keeps venue costs down, meaning ticket costs are down.”
Laguarda also wrote that having the event in the House meant students did not have to travel off campus, making the event “safer and more manageable for many students.”

Benedetto, an Italian restaurant that emphasizes local ingredients, opened its doors this week in the Charles Hotel.
The restaurant replaces Rialto, an award-winning restaurant that served Italian food for more than 20 years before closing this summer, and joins a roster of high-end restaurants, including Parsnip, Henrietta’s Table, and Harvest in Harvard Square.
Benedetto is the second Cambridge restaurant that Michael Pagliarini, Benedetto’s executive chef and co-owner, has opened in the past four years. He co-owns both Benedetto and the Massachusetts Avenue spot Giulia with his wife Pam Ralston.
“We’ve been in the neighborhood for four years now with Giulia, and a lot of the folks that live and work in this community have dined with us,” Pagliarini said.
The menu, which Pagliarini said he plans on regularly adjusting, includes offerings from braised duck leg tortelloni to pasta made in-house. Though some specialty ingredients come straight from Italy, Pagliarini said a major focus of the restaurant is the use of local ingredients.
“We are interpreters of great traditions, classic recipes, we interpret with what we have, that is to say local ingredients,” Pagliarini said.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, attended the restaurant’s “soft opening,” which she said was successful. The restaurant will likely attract the parents of college students in Cambridge when they visit their children, Jillson said.
Pagliarini said he is looking forward to attracting customers who flock to Harvard Square.
“There are so many world events that happen right in this area, people need a place to gather, a place to have dinner, exchange ideas, have spirited discussions, and we can be that place, and that is a really meaningful and exciting this for me to do,” Pagliarini said.
Alex Attia, the general manager of the Charles Hotel, said he looked for a local chef to run the restaurant replacing Rialto. For Attia, Benedetto is a continuation of the hotel’s historic attempt to focus on local products and encourage local talent.
Benedetto joins a crop of recent culinary arrivals to Harvard Square, including Sweetgreen, Tatte and En Boca.
Pagliarini, who travelled through France and studied at the Culinary Institute of America before becoming a professional chef, said that opening a new restaurant is a difficult, yet rewarding, task.
“It’s like a band, every night it gets a little tighter. And that’s what happening. Getting to know each other, know each other well’s moves. It’s a Herculean task right now to get a restaurant like this running,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students within the College’s History and Literature academic program have flocked to a new Modern World field within the discipline, taking advantage of the ability to explore areas such as ethnic studies in a way that transcends the program’s prior insistence on a regional focus.
Previously, concentrators within Hist and Lit had to specialize within one of six regional tracks in the program. After reforming its field structure last spring and developing new tracks based on historical time periods, the honors academic program has seen a dramatic redistribution of concentrators into the new Modern World field.
The Modern World field allows students to more easily explore topics such as migration and diaspora at a time when many students have been calling for increased ethnic studies course offerings and an ethnic studies department.
Hist and Lit Director of Studies Lauren O. Kaminsky said the Modern World field, formerly known as postcolonial studies under the old structure, has become the second largest focus field within Hist and Lit—a large jump considering postcolonial studies had been the program’s smallest focus field.
Focus fields were regionally based in the old system, with offerings in Latin American, American, European, Postcolonial, Early Modern European, and Modern European studies. The new system replaced the latter three fields with historical categories—Medieval World, Early Modern World, and Modern World.
Kaminsky said many students have opted for the Modern World field because of their interest in topics that do not fit within traditional national or regional borders.
“It’s clear that some students have previously been using the American studies field to do more transnational work, and the introduction of the Modern World means that they don’t have to do that if they don’t want to. If they want to do it under a different rubric, that is available to them,” she said.
Hist and Lit concentrator Olivia D. Herrington ’18 said she has benefited from the new field system because her academic research, which focuses on “traumatic memory” in both America and sub-Saharan Africa, spans beyond the geographic bounds of the American field.
“I was thinking that I would declare American in Hist and Lit because Modern World didn’t exist then, and then do a subfield in sub-Saharan Africa, so it made it a lot easier with just Modern World,” she said.
In addition to the greater ease in studying diverse topics made possible by the new field structure, Hist and Lit Chair Amanda J. Claybaugh said the program is thinking about other ways to increase the diversity of its faculty, students, and course offerings through further field reform and new hires.
“We have a set of lecturers whom we hire based on student interest, and then we also have [three] tenure-track faculty… two of whom are women of color, and we have said to the deans that if we were to get a fourth, we’d be interested in a scholar of indigenous studies,” Claybaugh said.
Claybaugh added the concentration is currently considering reforms to its American studies field to make it more relevant and useful to students pursuing projects that may extend beyond the United States.
While the increased flexibility within the program has allowed students to more easily focus on transnational areas like migration and ethnic studies, Kaminsky said she thought Hist and Lit has long shown a commitment to ethnic studies by supporting concentrators studying “Latino studies, Asian American studies, African and African American studies” for at least a decade.
Claybaugh and Kaminsky also said many of the students calling for ethnic studies have come from the Hist and Lit department.
“A lot of those petitions were written by Hist and Lit students,” Claybaugh said. “It’s becoming a real place for activism for this stuff, and so we feel proud that we’ve created the conditions where students can then start advocating for change at Harvard.”
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey said in a late November interview that increasing the diversity of courses and faculty across the arts and humanities has been a top priority for him in his first semester as divisional dean. He said diversity will be a focus in hiring new lecturers, and tenure-track faculty, and in curricular reviews, which he said are currently ongoing throughout the various concentrations within the Arts and Humanities.
“I think we need to make the arts and humanities much more inclusive than it has been,” he said in November. “I think it will be crucial to add new faculty with expertise in these unrepresented or underrepresented areas.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 2, 2016, at 1:40 p.m.
The Harvard Islamic Society will host a discussion highlighting issues of discrimination against Muslims in America in light of Donald Trump's election to the presidency.
The event, titled “Rights & Registries: Teach-In on Institutionalized Islamophobia,” is scheduled to take place Friday afternoon in Boylston Hall’s Fong Auditorium. A Facebook page for the teach-in invites attendees to “come learn about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiment” in “the wake of the election.”
Anwar Omeish ’17, a member of the Islamic Society who will lead the discussion Friday, said the teach-in is an opportunity for people to learn “what Islamophobia looks like” on a level broader than bigotry against individuals.
“So, like, beyond your friend who says racist things,” she said. “Thinking about policies, networks, and structures that target Muslims and Muslim communities. And obviously it’s a particularly fraught time right now, considering the election.”
Over the course of his controversial campaign, Trump often targeted Muslims and Muslim Americans. A year ago, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” in the wake of a massacre in San Bernardino, Calif.
In the days following Trump’s election, some Harvard students and faculty reported hate speech and harassment based on their ethnicity or disability. On Nov. 17, Harmann Singh, a first-year Harvard Law student, wrote in an editorial for the Boston Globe that he was confronted and called “a f***ing Muslim” by a man in a store a few blocks from campus.
Trump has since disavowed his proposal to ban Muslims from the country, but his plan to form database of practicing Muslims in the U.S. still stands. Omeish said she considers the planned teach-in at Harvard a “response” to “misconceptions and issues” raised over the course of the 2016 election.
She emphasized, however, that the discussion is intended primarily as a call to action.
“It’s definitely not an event that’s like, ‘hey, Muslims aren’t that bad,’” she said. “[It’s] like, so, this election happened, there are actual policies that target Muslim people, there have been and there will continue to be, what do they look like and what can we do about them.”
The teach-in comes at a time when many minority students on Harvard’s campus have reported feeling anxious about the implications of Trump’s presidency. Undocumented students have been especially vocal, rallying in Harvard Yard last month and petitioning Harvard to take measures to protect its undocumented affiliates.
Omeish said she thinks it is “extraordinarily important” to focus on issues facing undocumented immigrants. She added, however, that she thinks the needs of Muslims can sometimes be “overlooked,” both on campus and nationwide.
“One of the goals of this teach-in is to be like, ‘hey, the way we’re talking about all of these other issues as problems that we need to fix, we also need to be talking about this one,’” Omeish said.
Eleanor A. Bragg ’19, who plans to attend the discussion, echoed Omeish’s sentiments.
“If Muslim-American students are calling for more discussion and/or education on campus about Islamophobia under Trump, then student groups and administration should definitely support that discussion,” she wrote in an email.

This article has been updated to reflect the following correction: 
CORRECTION: December 2, 2016 
A previous version of this article indicated that Donald Trump told reporters two weeks ago he “would certainly implement” a Muslim registry in the United States. In fact, he told reporters that a year ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

The Harvard women’s basketball team knew that if it stuck to the scouting report against formidable foe Temple on Thursday night, everything else would fall into place.
The Crimson did just that.
Harvard (6-1) enjoyed its first-ever triumph over the Owls (3-2), 73-62, thanks in part to the solid execution of a clever match-up zone defense.
“[The Owls are] a really good team,” freshman guard Katie Benzan said. “They’re really athletic, they have really good guards, really good bigs, and are… much better than the other opponents we’ve played.”
With the victory, Harvard extended its win streak to six games and remains an unbeaten in its four contests at Lavietes Pavilion this season. This six-game stretch of non-conference success is the Crimson’s longest such trend since the 2013-2014 season, which saw a seven-game streak.
“I honestly believe with this team, since we have so many scorers, [our keys to success are] defense and rebounding,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “[The players] did a fabulous job sticking to the scout.”
After a 5-0 Temple run to start the game, Harvard sophomore guard Madeline Raster got the Crimson on the board with a deep ball launched from the top of the arc. From that point forward, the Crimson gradually seized control of the game, recording four steals and four shot rejections in the first two quarters. Despite the few promising baskets shortly after tip-off, Temple struggled from the field in the first half, registering only 23 points—to Harvard’s 32—on 10-for-38 shooting.
“I think [the Owls] were shocked by us, to be honest,” Delaney-Smith said. “We had a nice little ‘junk defense.’ It was the correct defense for the game…and [the players] stuck to it.”
On top of the Crimson’s staunch defensive effort, Harvard dominated all areas when it came to scoring the basketball. The Crimson outshot Temple from the field, the charity stripe, and beyond the arc.
As the Owls’ scoring woes persisted, Raster continued to set the tone offensively, notching her team’s first nine points.
Furthermore, Harvard availed itself of the three-point shot early in the contest, finishing the first frame shooting 43 percent from downtown.
Though trailing by nine at the middle intermission, Temple attempted 11 more shots than did the Crimson, a testament to the Owls’ dominant first-half presence on the offensive glass, where they hauled in 11 boards in the first 20 minutes alone. Temple simply could not convert on the second chance opportunities it afforded itself by way of the offensive boards, perhaps the one bright spot in the Owls’ game.
Temple began the first half with a spark—a quick six-point run to open the second half allowed the Owls to trim Harvard’s lead to just four. Nevertheless, the Crimson pushed back and maintained its lead at or around 10 points for the remainder of the third quarter.
“Basketball is a game of runs,” Benzan said. “We just ended up having the last one, and we cut [Temple’s runs] short.”
The Crimson received hefty contributions from senior forward Destiny Nunley, who led all players with 21 points and imposed her will in the paint with five blocks and 10 rebounds. Just like Nunley, sophomore guard Sydney Skinner recorded a double-double of the points-rebounds variety.
“Every game, it’s someone else who steps up,” Nunley said. “I think that’s what makes us so successful right now…. Everybody can put the ball in the basket and [plays] great defense.”
For visiting Temple, upperclassman guards Tanaya Atkinson, Alliya Butts, and Feyonda Fitzgerald all tallied at least 15 points, with Atkinson pulling down a game-high 12 boards.
By out-rebounding the opposition 43-39 on Thursday night, Harvard continues its season-long streak of controlling the glass.
Historically, when the Crimson dominates the boards, it dictates the game, as shown by its 12-3 record last season in 15 games with the rebounding advantage.
“We really came out and gave it our all,” junior guard Taylor Rooks said. “It was great to see us get a lead as well as do all the little things that are necessary to win the game. [The game] was awesome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

After two-straight years of all-California men’s water polo NCAA semifinals, the Northeast is crashing the party. And it’s doing so in style.
No. 9 Harvard men’s water polo (27-6) defeated No. 9 UC Davis (23-6) in the NCAA quarterfinals to clinch a spot in the NCAA Final Four for the first time in program history. Regulation was not enough to separate the two squads. After the fourth quarter buzzer sounded with the duo knotted at 14 points apiece, the Crimson needed overtime to beat out the Aggies, 16-15.
In the first three-minute period of OT, senior Viktor Wrobel scored early to give Harvard the 15-14 advantage. Wrobel’s goal was the only of the period as Harvard carried the lead into the last period of play.
Already up one, freshman Austin Sechrest scored what would end up being the game-winner in the second overtime period. A late goal by the Aggies would trim the deficit to one, but UC Davis was not able to find the equalizer before the final seconds ran off the clock.
“We didn’t have the best game all around,” co-captain Harry Tafur said. “There were plenty of mistakes, but going into overtime… we knew we had the experience to get the job done and the confidence in our physical abilities and our conditioning to finish the game strong. That’s a testament to our coaches and training regimen that allows us to play at a high level for a whole game and an extra couple of periods.”
The Aggies got on the board first capitalizing on a Harvard penalty to go up 1-0 with 6:27 left in the first quarter. Harvard then erupted to score four consecutive goals to take an early 4-1 lead. Freshman Charlie Owens scored twice and seniors Joey Colton and Dan Stevens tallied one each. Late in the quarter, UC Davis scored twice to cut Harvard’s lead to one, but a shot from senior Noah Harrison brought the lead back up to two (5-3) before the end of the first frame.
UC Davis opened up the second quarter with a goal but Colton and Harrison responded fast with one apiece to extend the lead to 7-4. The Aggies followed up by going on a 4-1 run evening the score to 8-8 before entering the intermission.
The second half started with goals from junior Colin Chiapello and Sechrest started the second half to give Harvard the lead back. Then the Aggies notched two of their own to tie the game back up.
Colton completed a hat trick to momentarily pull the Crimson ahead, but two UC Davis goals gave the Aggies the lead for the first time in the game, ending the third quarter up 12-11.
“We played Davis twice before and one won and lost one so we knew it wasn’t going to be an easy game,” Tafur said. “That being said we were confident in our chances and our system and that we would be successful.”
UC Davis’s lead didn’t last long as Chiapello beat the goalkeeper to record his second goal of the game and even the score 12-12. Harrison quickly followed with his third goal of the game to give Harvard the one goal advantage with a little over six minutes to play. The Crimson defense was able to keep the Aggies for almost three minutes, but a goal with 3:47 left tied up the game at 13. Harvard immediately answered back with a goal off a rebound by Owens. Two minutes later UC Davis fought back with a goal to tie up the game to stay alive. Timeouts on both sides were unable to produce a goal, setting the scene for the late-game dramatics.
“Rght now, everyone is just really absorbing the moment,” Tafur said. “[Reaching the] Final Four is not an accomplishment that many teams in any sport really gets to say. So the fact that all our hard work has paid off is definitely pleasing.”
Despite the game leaking into extra time, it was the shortest NCAA Championship game for the team thus far. Harvard traveled west after defeating Bucknell in the opening play-in game in sudden-death after two overtime periods failed to yield a winner.
“Each game since two weeks ago has been the biggest game our season, the biggest game of most of our careers so far,” sophomore Nathan Ondracek said. “We’re taking it one step at a time and just enjoying each win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The nation’s third best offense versus the ECAC’s top defense: something will have to give tonight in North Country.
At 7 p.m., the offense—that of the No. 8 Harvard men’s hockey team—will look to get the better of the defense—that of No. 19 St. Lawrence, at Appleton Arena. The Crimson (6-2-1, 2-1-1 ECAC) has averaged 4.22 goals per game so far this season, but the Saints (8-4-4, 5-0-2) have surrendered just a goal a game in conference play.
In fact, propelled by its defense, St. Lawrence has yet to drop an ECAC game this season, and its seven-game run—which includes two shutouts against No. 5/7 Quinnipiac—has the Saints currently sitting in first place in the conference.
Largely because of this in-league success, St. Lawrence has not lost a game since Oct. 28, when it suffered its only home loss of the season against Wisconsin. The Saints’ nine game unbeaten streak is the third-longest active run in the country.
Over the course of that stretch, junior goaltender Kyle Hayton has played out of his mind, posting a .961 save percentage and a 1.18 goals against average. His .934 save percentage for the season ranks seventh in the country and first in the conference.
Senior defenseman and assistant captain Gavin Bayreuther, the only member of last year’s all-ECAC first team still playing in college, leads St. Lawrence with 18 points through 16 games. Among defensemen, his point total ranks first in the nation, while his 1.12 points per game mark is second only to Harvard’s Adam Fox (1.22).
On the offensive end, one year removed from an excellent rookie campaign, top-liner Jacob Pritchard has five goals and eight assists. His linemate, Joe Sullivan, is tied for the team lead in goals with seven, along with seven helpers.
By the numbers, St. Lawrence’s greatest weakness is its power play, which has converted at an abysmal 9.8 percent clip—seventh worst in the country. The Saints do have five power play goals in their last three games thanks to favorable matchups with lowly Brown and UMass, but before that, their conversion rate was below 5.5 percent, a mark that would currently rank last in the nation by more than a percentage point.
Meanwhile, Harvard enters Friday with the second-ranked power play unit in the country, having converted at 27.5 percent rate. Granted, this number remains largely inflated—six of the Crimson’s 11 power play goals have come against Arizona State and Bentley, but Harvard’s man advantage has shown plenty of promise, highlighted by a three-goal performance against No. 3 Boston College last month. The Crimson unit ranks just ninth in the ECAC at 11.8 percent, but the sample size is small (four games). Should penalties play a significant factor tonight, Harvard’s power play certainly has the edge over that of the hosts.
These sides met three times a season ago, including in the ECAC tournament semifinals at Herb Brooks Arena, and the Crimson was victorious on each occasion. Two of the tilts were one-goal games, but Harvard took care of business at Appleton Arena, knocking off the hosts, 4-1, on their Senior Night.
