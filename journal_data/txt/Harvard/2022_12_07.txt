After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Say bonjour, ciao, or hello to expanded language learning at Harvard: The Language Center’s Language Exchange Program — an online database where Harvard affiliates may discover and match with peers who speak their target languages — recently received several thousand dollars from the Culture Lab Innovation Fund to extend its reach. We are thrilled to see Harvard invest its heavy coffers into language learning and look forward to resounding benefits.
Learning a new language is a difficult endeavor with profound value. Of course, knowledge of an additional language unlocks a wealth of opportunities abroad. But language is more than mere mechanistic communication; it also serves as a looking glass into diverse cultures and perceptions of the world. Multilingualism sensitizes us to global perspectives, as revealed through foreign news media, untranslated literature, and — crucially — unfiltered conversations with native speakers. For Harvard’s overwhelmingly American undergraduate student body hailing from a country with limited foreign language study, engaging with these global perspectives is critical to develop a richer understanding of the world.
To learn a language is to more intimately understand a people. Harvard cannot promise to educate global citizens if it fails to engage with global, non-English voices.
We laud the format of the Language Exchange Program for successfully engaging with such voices. The comfortable, casual environment of one-on-one conversations with a peer poses learning as a stress-free, grade-free social experience. Language learners participate in learning for learning’s sake in an environment based on human interaction — a soul-nourishing paradigm that’s all too rare at Harvard. Along the way, participants may create the genuine, lasting personal relationships that scaffold the Harvard experience.
Through these personal, intimate meetings, native English speakers also experience the vulnerability that comes with trying to appear funny, intelligent, or clear in a language not your own. This can, in turn, help counter the American instinct to dismiss the merit of ideas delivered in less-than-fluent English.
We encourage our fellow College students to sign up for the Language Exchange Program, find their own matches, and experience the program’s unique rewards. Given the rave reviews of participants so far, the University may want to consider supplementing the current undergraduate language requirement with participation in the program.
Still, we recognize that the College’s graduation requirements are demanding, and it can often be difficult to make space for language courses within an already packed schedule. This is particularly true for STEM students and those pursuing pre-professional careers. The Language Exchange Program’s flexibility affords students the opportunity to practice languages and retain cultural connections outside of precious course slots. Any initiatives to include program participation within graduation requirements should be designed carefully, to preserve the stress-free nature of the program.
The funding allocated towards the Language Exchange Program is a valuable step toward continuing to broaden diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. However, the path forward entails many more steps. We urge the University to parallel the laudable expansion of this informal, peer-to-peer program, with equal expansion in formal language instruction. The languages taught at Harvard indicate the institution’s priorities. The presence of, for example, Latin, a dead language, but not Tagalog, the fourth most-spoken primary language in the United States, in the course catalog reflects an epistemic scar of colonialism that students are still fighting to redress. To combat this, the University should seek to offer as many languages as possible, formally and informally.
All these languages together will need a physical building to house them. As this Editorial Board has previously argued, Harvard desperately needs an official multicultural center, where students from different backgrounds can come together in dialogue — perhaps even in the languages they’re attempting to learn. The current lack of a multicultural center, like that of formal instruction in major world languages, is a glaring discrepancy in Harvard’s avowed commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
A few thousand dollars for a single language program may seem small. But properly nurtured, this spark could ignite significant DEI changes at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pforzheimer House Faculty Deans Anne Harrington ’82 and John R. Durant will step down at the end of the 2022-2023 academic year after a 10-year tenure, the pair announced in an email to house residents Monday.
Harrington, a professor and director of undergraduate studies in the History of Science, and Durant, the director of the MIT Museum and an adjunct professor at MIT, assumed their positions in the 2013-2014 school year. The two described their transition out of the roles as “bittersweet.”
“The opportunity to lead a House at Harvard College is one of the greatest privileges available to a faculty member,” the faculty deans wrote in the email. “Faculty Deans agree at the outset to accept this privilege for a period of time, and to then pass it forward. Our time has now come to pass our leadership role onto a successor.”
In the emailed announcement, the deans said their tenure has been a “profoundly meaningful journey.”
“I hope it is clear: you are not just ‘students’ to us, and this is not just a ‘job’ for us – you are part of our pfamily, and we will carry your love and memories of our time together forward forever,” they wrote.
The search process for the house’s next deans will begin in the coming days, according to Harrington and Durant’s email. During the process, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana solicits interest from tenured faculty, assembles a search committee to conduct interviews with house residents, and consults with University administrators before selecting the next faculty deans.
“The College will be putting a process into place to find new and wonderful Faculty Deans for Pfoho, and you will all have an opportunity to help shape that process and participate in the selection,” Harrington and Durant wrote.
“But just know, pfriends, how blessed we feel to have been able to live alongside and with you in this role all these years,” they added. “You have given us an excuse to play, given us a window into your lives, and taught us so much about what community can really mean, and that it can never be taken for granted. For all of that, our gratitude is endless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Planning and Development Agency discussed how its construction project on Soldiers Field Road will adhere to recently approved Western Avenue Corridor Study and Rezoning guidelines in a Wednesday webinar.
The project, which will span roughly three acres along 1234 and 1240 Soldiers Field Road, is a joint endeavor between the Davis Companies, the Community Builders, and the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation. The development will include 528 residential units, 195 hotel rooms, retail space including a live music venue, underground parking, and public green space.
Bart Mitchell, president of the Community Builders, a nonprofit development company, said the project aims to accommodate a “wide range” of incomes spanning 30 percent to 120 percent of median income, with an average of no more than 60 percent of median income.
But Mitchell said affordable, mixed housing is not alone enough to foster camaraderie among residents.
“It could feel like it’s somebody’s home and not somebody else’s, unless you really have staff that have been trained to help make sure everybody knows this is everybody’s home,” Mitchell said.
To address this concern, Mitchell said the development companies have considered hosting opportunities for neighbors to meet each other and playing a variety of music in the public courtyard.
Jason Tilley, senior vice president of development for the Davis Companies, said parking for the site will be largely underground.
“We think we’re striking a good balance here between giving enough parking to those people who really need it and want it and are going to have a car anyway,” Tilley said, “while at the same time not overbuilding parking and encouraging people that otherwise wouldn’t drive or wouldn’t have a car to just park one here anyway.”
Before turning the meeting over to Impact Advisory Group members and the public for comments, Tilley said he expects the project would create more than 500 construction jobs as well as 170 permanent, new jobs targeting women, people of color, and Boston residents.
IAG members expressed broad support for the plan, though some voiced concerns about gentrification of the area and the longevity of affordable housing.
“I really feel that people like me on Western Avenue — are in the immediate neighborhood — are being gentrified. The few two-family and three-family homes on Western Avenue — they’ll all be gone and all be developed,” said John Bruno, a member of the IAG. “I really think there needs to be some sensitivity moving forward.”
In response to affordability concerns, John Woods, executive director of the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, said the IRS will enforce and monitor the affordability of the housing.
“I always explain to people that they’re the ones who brought down Al Capone. You don’t mess with the IRS,” he said. “The investors and everybody else involved has to be monitored on a yearly basis to make sure that they keep the level of affordability that is initiated at the beginning.”
Michael Sinatra, BPDA senior project manager, concluded the meeting by inviting the public to an open house 6-8 p.m. on Dec. 12 at the Jackson Mann Community Center to discuss the project as well as two others in the Allston-Brighton area.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sean Caron, managing director of Harvard Real Estate, will serve as the new vice president for campus services, the University announced Tuesday.
In his new role, Caron will oversee approximately 1,800 employees across Harvard’s operating service departments, including facilities management, sustainability upgrades, and diversity and inclusion workplace projects. Caron will step into his new office on Jan. 3, filling the vacancy left by Meredith L. Weenick ’90 after she was promoted to become the University’s executive vice president earlier this year.
Caron currently oversees asset, property, and construction management across Harvard real estate, which spans approximately 3.8 million square feet in 110 buildings.
“From his leadership of Harvard Real Estate, he has a deep understanding of the programmatic needs and objectives of the University’s Schools and units, effectively aligning services and real estate transactions with priorities across our Harvard community,” Weenick told the Harvard Gazette, a University publication.
Caron came to Harvard in 2019 after serving as the chief of property operations and chief of staff at the Community Builders Inc., a national nonprofit real estate developer founded in Boston. Prior to that, Caron spent five years as the director of public policy for the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, a nonprofit advocating for affordable housing in Massachusetts.
Weenick also praised Caron’s “innovative and thoughtful leadership” in light of Covid-19. During the pandemic, Caron helped to establish isolation housing for students and supported showering accommodations for unhoused individuals on Church St.
Caron told the Gazette that he has been inspired by “the depth of the talent and the strong commitment to making the world a better place” he has found at Harvard.
“I think on a personal level, whatever challenges you have going on in your life, if you look around Harvard, there’s someone — usually one of the best in the world — working to solve that challenge or to make the world a better place,” he said. “In this new role, I look forward to being an enabler of that work by providing the space and campus services that make it possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A majority of Harvard Kennedy School affiliates with disabilities said the school is not inclusive of people with disabilities and lacks accessibility, according to a newly released report from the HKS Disability Justice Caucus.
The report surveyed 379 HKS affiliates, representing 27 percent of students, 36 percent of faculty, and 11 percent of staff. Respondents answered a series of questions about accessibility issues at the school and the prevalence of disability policy issues in HKS courses. Members of the Disability Justice Caucus used the report’s findings to produce recommendations for the Kennedy School’s administration to improve the school’s accessibility.
Priscilla A. A. Mensah, a student at the Kennedy School who currently serves as chair of the Disability Justice Caucus, presented the report to HKS affiliates at an event Friday afternoon. Mensah said she organized the event — which was held one day prior to the International Day of Persons with Disabilities — for the “express purpose of bringing issues of disability, justice, and inclusion from the margin to the center of the learning experience here at HKS.”
The report found that affiliates believe the Kennedy School should improve the accessibility of its classrooms and buildings, with 37.5 percent of affiliates — a plurality — somewhat or strongly disagreeing that HKS is physically accessible to people with disabilities.
HKS spokesperson Sofiya C. Cabalquinto wrote in a statement to The Crimson that “HKS is committed to creating an environment that is accessible to, and inclusive of, all of our community members.”
“We are grateful to the student leaders of the Disability Justice Caucus for helping to collect feedback so we can better understand our students’ experiences,” Cabalquinto wrote. “We will continue to work closely with students to provide accommodations and improve support and learning opportunities so that our campus is a place where all can thrive.”
Mensah said she was motivated to produce the report after her fall 2021 statistics course required students with accommodations to arrive at 6:30 a.m. to take their final exam. While the course eventually changed its exam policy after receiving student feedback, Mensah said the experience had a lasting impact on her.
“For students like me who use the day van in the morning or for students who go to the cafeteria because they can’t, due to disability, cook for themselves, that would have obviously meant that they were dramatically inconvenienced,” Mensah said.
“That, for me, was just a really clear example of how things can be so differential for disabled students in the HKS experience,” Mensah added. “And the goal is always to move towards there being equity between all classmates.”
Theodore “Teddy” Svoronos, the professor who taught Mensah’s statistics class, attended the event on Friday where he expressed gratitude to Mensah for discussing ways to make his class more accessible for students.
“It wasn’t until we really heard from students and got that feedback that we realized we should do things differently,” Svoronos said.
Surveyed students also believe HKS should include more course content about disability policy issues, with 81 percent saying they somewhat or strongly disagree that “HKS is doing enough to prepare its students to work with populations with disabilities once they graduate.”
In the report’s recommendations, the Disability Justice Caucus calls on the Kennedy School to “increase the number of faculty and administrators possessing policy expertise and practice in the area of disability and accessibility.”
Mensah said she hopes disability policy issues gain a more prominent role in HKS courses.
“I want this institution to have disability-related content in everything — in every course across the board,” Mensah said, “so that we can say that everything that the Kennedy School does, as well as in the area of disability inclusion, really aligns with its values.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON — A key government witness in the federal bribery trial of former Harvard fencing coach Peter Brand laid out new details on Tuesday about how he helped a wealthy Maryland businessman funnel money via nonprofits to the coach in exchange for recruiting spots for his sons.
Alexandre Ryjik, who confessed during the first day of trial to being the “middleman” in an alleged bribery scheme between Brand and Jie “Jack” Zhao, told jurors during his marathon five-hour testimony Tuesday that he used his nonprofit to transfer money between Zhao and Brand.
Brand and Zhao face bribery charges that were brought by a federal grand jury after their arrest in 2020. Prosecutors say Zhao paid out a series of bribes to Brand to get his sons into Harvard as fencing recruits, including covering the coach’s bills and purchasing his home at an inflated price.
Ryjik, who coached Zhao’s two sons at a Virginia-based fencing academy he founded, helped “broker” the bribery scheme between Brand and Zhao, according to prosecutors. Zhao gave $1 million to Ryjik’s charity, the National Fencing Foundation, in February 2013 — about $100,000 of which was donated to the newly-established Peter Brand Foundation the following year.
A defense attorney for Zhao sought to portray Ryjik as a liar who is cooperating with the government to avoid prosecution. During the first day of trial on Monday, Ryjik admitted to using his fencing academy’s money to pay personal expenses and unintentionally underreporting the organization’s revenue on Paycheck Protection Plan loan applications.
“The fact is that you misused tens of thousands of dollars through the charity,” Zhao’s attorney, Michael T. Packard ’02, said to Ryjik. “You were hoping, through your discussions with the government, that you would not be charged with any of your crimes?”
“I guess maybe I was, but that wasn’t the main focus,” said Ryjik, who has a proffer agreement with the government in the case.
According to 2013 communications presented by prosecutors, Zhao played an intimate role in his oldest son’s recruitment to the Harvard fencing team, submitting a write-up of his accomplishments and arranging an interview between his son and an admissions official that was set up through Brand. Brand referred to Ryjik as “maestro,” “boss,” and “Uncle Ryjik” in the emails the government showed.
In contrast, Ryjik told jurors that when his own son was recruited by Harvard’s fencing team in 2011, he didn’t play a role in the inner workings of the process.
On Oct. 18, 2013, three days before Zhao’s oldest son received a likely letter from the College, Brand forwarded to Ryjik instructions on making a wire transfer to his foundation, according to emails shown during the trial, though he did not receive a donation from Ryjik’s charity until after the Peter Brand Foundation became a nonprofit.
In evidence presented by prosecutors, Brand indicated he expected to receive $7.5 million from Ryjik’s foundation, though only $100,000 ever came through. Brand wrote to Ryjik in a 2013 email, “I just want to confirm that the contributions total 7.5 Million as we discussed this initially to make sure that all of this is worth my while.” Ryjik testified that the figure came from him telling Brand “that UPenn got $7.5 million for the recruitment of two fencers.”
Ryjik testified that he was “scared” by Brand’s request and never replied to the email.
He was “getting very demanding,” Ryjik told Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen E. Frank ’95. “I thought the whole deal was going to get exposed.”
From that point on, Ryjik said his relationship with Brand “ceased to exist.”
“We stopped talking to each other,” he said.
An official at Ryjik’s National Fencing Foundation was perplexed by the finances of Brand’s foundation as he was seeking the additional contributions, according to evidence presented by prosecutors. In a 2014 memorandum, NFF Secretary Phillip L. Sbarbaro raised alarm at the $67,000 the Peter Brand Foundation was paying Brand’s wife in compensation and the $8,580 it dished out to his son.
Prosecutors sought to detail the close relationship between Ryjik and Zhao throughout Ryjik’s testimony, highlighting trips the two took that Zhao paid for.
Ryjik facilitated other donations from his foundation at Zhao’s request, according to evidence presented by prosecutors — including a $50,000 contribution to the St. Albans School in Washington.
The relationship between Zhao and Brand was first publicly called into question by a 2019 Boston Globe story that revealed the businessman had bought Brand’s home for an inflated price. When Zhao learned the Globe was looking into his relationship with Brand, he contacted Ryjik to meet up in secret, according to text messages presented by prosecutors and Ryjik’s testimony.
The two met outside Ryjik’s fencing academy to talk about a Globe reporter’s inquiry — “Jack’s idea,” Ryjik testified.
“There were other people inside, and I didn’t want them to hear anything that we were going to be talking about,” Ryjik said. “I knew that we were discussing something that other people should not hear.”
In 2020, when federal agents raided Ryjik’s home, Ryjik told investigators that he “didn’t do anything wrong,” he said Tuesday.
“That was untrue,” he said. “I didn’t want to get in trouble.”
The trial is set to resume at 9 a.m. Wednesday, when Ryjik will be called back to the stand for cross-examination. The government is expected to call more witnesses after his testimony concludes.
Correction: December 7, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly identified the assistant U.S. attorney who questioned Alexandre Ryjik on Tuesday. It was Stephen E. Frank ’95, not Ian J. Stearns.
