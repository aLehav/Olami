After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week in my own Kirkland House, the House Committee sent an email urging students to “Join me and da rest of Ho(od)Co fo' a $tein Club dat you don' wanna miss y'all!!” Immediately some students responded to the list explaining that they were offended by this language, which they viewed as racially charged, while others wrote that they saw nothing problematic about the email. Before too long, one of my housemates, Naji Filali ’14, wrote a response in the Harvard Political Review arguing that the email’s message “was so nebulous to the point of being indiscernible as to whom it was actually targeting, if anyone at all" and that “vocalizing concerns about racial difference cannot only be overwrought if done consistently and over mild cultural references, but it only accentuates a feeling of difference and exclusivity within a given community.” In this way, for approximately the one-billionth time, the conversation about how useful it is to focus on political correctness and minority groups began.
The more philosophical issue at stake in such conversations is how to incorporate minority groups and the individuals who belong to them into the Harvard community. Filali’s article (to which he later tacked an apologetic addendum after a response from Kirkland House race relations tutors) implied that the best approach to diversity at Harvard is to value individuals apart from their minority status. Notice, for example, his concern that such policies “magnify the issue of race” and “make everyone self-conscious” about talking about it. The other possible approach would be to value minorities by acknowledging and even emphasizing minority status. Most people would probably choose a balance of the two approaches, but any such balance entails real contradictions.
I sympathize with Filali’s point to an extent because in my freshman year at Harvard, I too was surprised by the overt emphasis on race and ethnicity. The number of student organizations with specific racial and ethnic slants was especially striking. I’d arrived from potentially one of the most politically correct places on earth—the suburbs of Washington, D.C.—and in my high school, mentioning another person’s race was at least awkward and at most taboo. If you wanted to describe your friend, you could mention that she was blond, but not that she was black. Yet on campus, approximately 130 of the official student organizations had some racial or ethnic qualifier. The ethos I’d been brought up with was to accept differences but not to mention them if possible. Harvard’s culture instead tended toward trumpeting them. In my first months at Harvard, I wondered if the latter approach made things worse as it sought to make them better.
But over the last few years I have come to the conclusion that the emphasis on race and ethnicity at Harvard exists in response to real tensions in the "real world.” (Surprise! Racism still exists and Harvard is not an island in this respect.) In this case, for example, Filali suggested that the race relations tutors of Kirkland had forced an apology out of the House Committee, but it instead seems that numerous offended students approached the tutors. It’s a valid point that sometimes being politically correct can draw unnecessary emphasis to race and ethnicity, but it’s naïve to imagine that this is usually the case, not to mention insulting to people who may have real grievances. Another way of thinking about it is that it is generally rude to assume that people who seek medical help are hypochondriacs; for similar reasons it is rude to assume that those who are offended do not have cause.
Filali suggests “we should not isolate ourselves from ethnic, racial, or cultural reference points and symbols. In interacting with them and sounding them out, we navigate their social relevance and significance, and engage in meaningful and thought-provoking debate in an inclusive way.” He fails to recognize how frequently this requires the assumption that we may have genuinely offended our peers. More broadly, while it’s not unfair to imagine that sometimes the best way to respect minority groups is not to bring up their status, this is a bad default assumption. There is a balance to be had between polite silence and meaningful discussion, but if other members of the Harvard community feel hurt in some way, the balance has swung toward the latter. When fellow students find something objectionable, the decent response is not to tell them they are being overly sensitive and making things worse. The correct response is to apologize and listen.

How should a great university, committed to diversity and freedom of speech, deal with the recurring problem of whether to “sponsor” a student-run event that is deeply offensive to other students?  This issue is currently being debated in the context of the upcoming conference entitled "Israel/Palestine and the One-State Solution."  Similar controversies have engulfed other universities, in many different contexts, and will continue to confront Harvard in the future. Harvard, and other schools like it, should follow guidelines consistent with the mission of the University and its commitment to the most fulsome freedom of expression.
The primary criterion a university must apply when deciding whether an event should be sponsored is political and ideological neutrality.  What is good for the goose must be good for the gander and what is bad for the gander must be bad for the goose.  Offensiveness to one group cannot be measured differently than offensiveness to another group. Moreover, the university must maintain a near perfect circle of civility whose circumference cannot conveniently be stretched to accommodate the “political correctness” of the day.  These rules should be articulated in advance of specific problems being raised, cloaking them with a Rawlsian veil of neutrality.
When confronted with choices about what kind of events can take place on campus, there are essentially five approaches a university could take.  The first is called “the taxi cab rule.”  Taxis must pick up all potential customers and generally do not refuse service to anyone.  A university could adopt such an approach, but if it did, it would have to make its facilities available to the Ku Klux Klan, to the Westboro Baptist Church, and to other racist, sexist, and homophobic groups.
A second approach would be to have explicit criteria set out in advance that are clear and relatively non-discretionary.  For example, a rule could permit a school to deny support to any group that deliberately provokes and insults students based on race, religion, ethnicity, national origin, gender or sexual preference.  Such a rule would exclude the KKK and the Westboro Baptist Church, which clearly fit those negative criteria.  But it might also deny sponsorship to atheists who mock religion or raucous comedians whose shtick is to be offensive to everyone.
The third approach is to deny sponsorship to all groups that are offensive to anyone.  This is a dangerous prescription for widespread censorship that gives those who are most easily offended (or claim to be) the power to suppress speech.  No great university should adopt such a rule.
The fourth approach is to vest discretion in some university official to be exercised based on undefined criteria such as whether an event is “consistent with the mission of the university.”  This, too, is dangerous to freedom, because the discretionary decisions are likely to reflect the political correctness of the day.  It is precisely those ideas that are politically incorrect that require the protection of free speech rules.
The final approach would be for a university never to sponsor or support financially any politically or ideologically controversial events, but simply to allow its rooms to be used by any group with a faculty advisor and a minimum number of members.
In the end I support the taxi cab approach, with the full realization that it will allow speech that is deeply offensive and disturbing to some.  The appropriate response to offensive speech inheres in the open marketplace of ideas, which permits “good” speech to counter “bad” speech, without defining either.
In order to determine how a rule of neutrality would apply to the current debate, consider the following thought experiment: What would Harvard’s response be if a group of right wing students and faculty decided to convene a conference on the topic “Are the Palestinians Really a People?” and invited as speakers only hard right academics who answered that question in the negative?  Would the Provost’s office help fund such a conference?  Would the Kennedy School host it?  Both the actual and hypothetical conferences would be deeply offensive to many students and faculty (including me), since their subjects are both ploys designed to deny people—Jews and Palestinians—the right to self-determination.  They both have a veneer of academic and political acceptability which serve as a cover for their underlying bigotry.
Many of the speakers at the current conference will argue against “a Jewish state,” without protesting the Palestinian Constitution that formally establishes the Islamic religion as the only “official” faith and “the principles of Islamic Sharia” as the main source of law.  The Palestinian Constitution also does what many right-wingers are trying to do in the United States:  It establishes only one language—in their case, Arabic—as the “official language” of Palestine.  Israel, on the other hand, has three official languages—Hebrew, Arabic, and English—and does not have an “established” religion.  Indeed, most Israeli Jews are secular, and Judaism, Islam and Christianity stand on an equal basis, at least as a matter of law.  Israel does have a law of return, based not on religion but on the history of the exclusion of Jews from countries throughout the world during the Holocaust.  When Palestine is established, it too will have its own law of return.
By funding this one-sidedly offensive conference, Harvard has essentially committed itself to the taxi cab approach.  I hope it will maintain that commitment when other students sponsor equally controversial events.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last semester, Harvard’s own Institute of Politics   Tobacco Control Policy Group embarked on an initiative to institute a smoke-free policy within the University, starting with a proposed ban on smoking in Harvard Yard. This initiative resulted in a proposal in front of the Committee on Student Life last Thursday, which was attended by both College administrators and House Masters. With a proposed ban on smoking in the Yard now firmly on the table, we must to consider whether or not the implementation of a smoke-free campus is a necessary measure for the University.
Although the current proposal offers certain resources for those who opt to quit smoking as a result of the ban, the reality of the situation is that banning smoking in the Yard and elsewhere will compel many students to continue smoking in alternate locations. As we all know, Cambridge is not the safest off-campus environment, and enforcing a ban on smoking will inevitably place students’ safety in jeopardy by driving them toward potentially dangerous locales and privileging students who have access to off-campus locations where smoking is permitted.
It is also imperative to realize, without delegitimizing the student health concerns raised by the IOP Policy Group, that students are not inundated with smoke exposure throughout Harvard’s campus, or even throughout the Yard. The issue at hand, therefore, should not be one of protecting people from smoke exposure, but rather developing methods to make exposure as infrequent as possible while simultaneously ensuring the safety of students who do choose to smoke.
Where the interests of those opposed to smoke exposure are concerned, it would be far more reasonable to look to the current smoking policy on campus and increase its level of enforcement. According to the University, smoking is not permitted within 25 feet of any university building, thereby providing smokers with roughly designated on-campus areas that can be avoided by non-smokers if deemed necessary. Although this is an established policy for the University, smokers noticeably fail to adhere to these regulations, often to little or no consequence. A more rigid enforcement of this ban on behalf of the University will therefore likely resolve many of the same issues that the blanket ban attempts to alleviate without driving smokers to unsafe off-campus locations.
Stricter implementation of the 25-foot rule would serve to eliminate a culture of smoking that is fostered by the close proximity of smokers to buildings. It has become commonplace on campus to witness collective groups of students smoking outside Lamont Library, dorms in the Yard or upperclassmen Houses. By actually enforcing the ban against smoking near buildings, these groups of smokers will likely diminish in size and number. With this decline in the smoking clusters should come a decline in the temptation for others to smoke when they are regularly exposed to their peers smoking on the way in and out of buildings.
Regardless, however, of whether or not this current policy remains in place and allows for smoking on campus, we should focus on how the University can help students, faculty, and staff quit smoking on their own. Although University Health Services and the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services do make a commendable effort to welcome prospective quitters, more could be done. Students who quit smoking should be entitled to more comprehensive and beneficial assistance than the quit kits, consultations, and literature currently available. Faculty and staff, meanwhile, should be given access to services beyond a free visit to UHS. Moreover, the availability of these resources must be better communicated to the Harvard student body and faculty in an effort to ease their transition. The improved quality and increased publicity of these resources, however, should be a step taken by the AODS itself rather than as a by-product of the result of this IOP group’s new smoking proposal.
At present our community can be best served by a more stringent enforcement of the current smoking policies and a strengthening of cessation resources on campus. And as for the blanket ban? Well…we hope it goes up in smoke.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many people who have a good sense of what the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is about may not understand why we are asking the one-state question—and why we’re asking it now. The international community has been unanimous on the need for a Palestinian state for more than twenty years, so why not press the moral advantage? It is a good question. And the best answer to it is the shortest one: Palestine has been colonized out of existence. I was lucky enough to gain an insider’s view as it happened.
For six years, I worked as a legal advisor to the Palestinian negotiating team.  I attended countless negotiation sessions, examined scores of proposals and devised numerous counter-proposals.  Having spent these years at the negotiating table I came away with one commonsense conclusion—negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel would be futile so long as the power differential between the two parties was so drastically imbalanced. In other words, a nuclear-armed state boasting the unconditional support of the world’s only superpower does not negotiate with refugees—it dictates to them.
The Oslo process was marked by a powerful Israel freely imposing its will on the Palestinian people.  Rather than withdrawing completely to the 1967 boundary and removing all of the illegal Israeli settlements, Israeli leaders decided to colonize more and annex more Palestinian territory. Every Israeli proposal, and later the underlying premise of the negotiations, sought to accommodate Israel’s illegal behavior. Today, people who believe that the two-state solution is viable frequently evoke the concept of “land swaps.” In effect they’re saying, “The larcenist has succeeded; let’s respond to his bad behavior on his terms.”
Though I spent six years as a legal advisor, the negotiations have gone on for nearly twenty.  Today, Israelis and Palestinians are no closer to achieving a two-state settlement than they were in 1993.   In fact, they are further apart.  During this nearly twenty-year period the number of Israeli settlers tripled from 200,000 in 1993 to almost 600,000 today, and Israel has continually moved the goal post to its advantage. 
 
But the two-state problem extends beyond the issue of borders. Each successive Israeli proposal that I saw sought to hobble the sovereignty of the “Palestinian state” by controlling the area’s natural resources.  And during my time in Oslo, Israeli negotiators refused to even discuss the future of Jerusalem—a city that is holy and integral to Palestinians—and the fate of millions of Palestinian refugees.  It bears emphasizing that without addressing these fundamental issues no solution—one or two-state—will succeed.
With Palestinians and Israelis fated to live together, the time has come to think of new alternatives.  Instead of seeking to divide the land on which they live, and myopically focusing on the creation of a “state,” perhaps we should together think of creating a model that seeks to fulfill our mutual inalienable rights.  Perhaps instead of focusing on separation, we should examine prospects for reconciliation.   The student-led One-State Conference at Harvard this weekend aims to explore this alternative by looking at the difficulties and challenges that equality for all poses as well as some of the answers it provides.
Perspectives are already changing.  Today, more than a quarter of Palestinians support a single democratic state, despite the absence of any political party advocating such a move.  Israeli perspectives are changing too, with even a right-wing parliamentarian noting of Israel’s policies that: “The result is a solution that perpetuates the conflict and turns us from occupiers into perpetrators of massacres, to put it bluntly.”
While many seek to stifle this conversation, owing to current realities it is one that must be had.  Today, Palestinians and Israelis are virtually equal in numbers living on the same land.  In a few short years, Palestinians will exceed the number of Israelis.  Israel’s continued control over the lives of Palestinians has led many commentators to compare Israel’s practices to those of “apartheid,” including U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  And, with the impossibility of negotiations in which Israel treats the Palestinians as equals and upholds international law, a two-state settlement remains a mirage at best and will only serve to perpetuate the conflict.  Israelis and Palestinians don’t have another twenty years to waste.
Diana Buttu is a fellow with the Middle East Initiative at the Belfer Center and an Eleanor Roosevelt visiting fellow at the Human Rights Program at Harvard Law School. She previously served as a legal advisor to the Palestinian negotiating team in its negotiations with Israel and later as an advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

I spend a stupid amount of time being nostalgic.
When I’m feeling particularly guilty for it, I justify the pastime with the following:
1) Nostalgia is the appreciation of memories;
2) Memories are stories;
3) Stories are beautiful; ergo,
4) Nostalgia is a way of appreciating beauty.
The argument’s philosophical pitfalls aside, it reminds me that memories are derived from experiences, and this means that there must be an aspect of beauty in the present that I’m failing to acknowledge by focusing on beauty situated in the past. The implications of the argument work against the argument itself.
Though I’ve been trying my best to ignore it, these days I’m plagued by an anxiety about the future, a feeling enmeshed in the knowledge that most of my friends will be done with their undergraduate degrees in less than three months, that I will be left behind by them as I finish up the second semester of my senior year in the fall, and that, after May, my life as it is now will be pared down to memories.
When I try to picture how I might tell the story of my present at some point in the future, the recurring setting is that little café on Bow Street, so close to 14 Plympton, the place the former managing editor and I sometimes called “the café.” We both know this is a ludicrous moniker, and not just because the newsroom met its use with cruel ridicule. I’m fully aware that it’s a silly idea, that a place that just serves coffee can be so special that it deserves a definite particle. And of course I’m also aware of the absurdity inherent in the fact that I’ve probably spent more of my waking undergraduate hours in a single coffee shop than I have in libraries, lectures, and my various dorm rooms combined.
This beloved café of mine, Café Pamplona, probably looks like a pretty shitty coffee shop to a lot of people. The place is objectively cramped and badly lit, and most of the wait staff are more shy than welcoming. When you walk in, a couple of “creepy” foreigners—one of whom is unmistakably bald, though he might claim otherwise—are probably speaking loudly to each other in Spanish—maybe even singing loudly in Spanish—and in the afternoon when the place is full, it’s near impossible to get from the door to the back of the café where the only open tables invariably are.
But to me, and to many of my friends who are so-called regulars, it’s cozy and warm; the wait staff and we are on a first-name basis. The foreigners are the loveable Colombians and two of our closest friends, David and Saul, and the “open” table at the back of the room isn’t really empty: there’s already at least one friend sitting there, and happy to see us.
I hesitate to call our gathering a “café community,” because that phrase seems reductive somehow. We’re prone to thinking of ourselves as an institution because of the sense of permanence we feel in the café; but there’s also something very organic and spontaneous in our continued friendship. We never sat down and decided that this would be our café where all our best friends congregate. Something about who we are led us all there, and kept us around.
The café does attract a certain “type”: we tend to study some form of philosophy, critical theory, or literature; we get off on indulging in pretentious “thought boners”—a term coined by David just the other day—and need other thinkers to, uh, penetrate; and yet most of us are unabashedly irrational in our devotion to cigarettes, rolled or imported. We do our readings and write our papers at the café because we’re incapable of conceiving of work as separate from leisure, and of beauty as separate from love.
Who would be able to put up with or even sympathize with this kind of bullshit, other than us? We’ve really just been stuck with each other, and I’m glad for it. What matters to me most of all is that they—the  people, the bullshit, the café, all of it—have made my years here beautiful. Though I regret to witness the approaching end of this tale, ultimately I am thankful to add the four-year epic that took place in an unassuming basement café to my modest collection of memories:
Hopelessly idealistic and full of love, as freshmen or as sophomores we all gravitated towards this place that seemed to offer us some sort of synthesis. We would sit together on the patio as the warm rays of the spring sun fell on the yellow parasols, books held open, and cigarettes idly burning away between our fingers to mark the passage of time. Though we won’t know for a long time how or why, we will smile, as though our parted lips felt before us the beauty we had found here.

Best known for her role as Cho Chang in the Harry Potter series, actress Katie Leung is moving beyond her Hogwarts days as she takes the stage in the play “Wild Swans” at the American Repertory Theatre. The play, based on Jung Chang’s best-selling memoir, is being performed at the A.R.T. until March 11. Fifteen Minutes corresponded with the star of “Wild Swans” through email and asked her about her past in Harry Potter, her shift from film to theater, and how she “taps” into character.
Fifteen Minutes: What was it like moving on after the Harry Potter series ended? What experiences did you feel you gained from working with the other stars in Harry Potter?
Katie Leung: Although it was a sad day when the Harry Potter series ended, it was also a great feeling to be moving on and to be able to spend a consecutive month at university. I think one of the many experiences that I have taken with me from HP is keeping in mind the importance of having fun within a work environment. Being surrounded by stellar actors on my first acting job was nothing short of intimidating as they are all incredibly professional and serious while filming. But before long I realized there was a whole different world behind the camera and quickly learned that we as actors must find ways of entertaining each other whenever, wherever, and as much as possible in order to keep ourselves sane.
FM: What is it like working with the cast of “Wild Swans”?
KL: It has been and continues to be a real pleasure working with the cast of “Wild Swans”. They are inspiring and intelligent individuals who have all been especially good to me from the very beginning of production and have taught me an endless amount about the art of theater. Being part of an all-Asian cast has also meant that our cultural similarities have brought us even closer together and, in turn, I have made some lifelong friends.
FM: Do you find it difficult to adjust from getting in front of a camera to acting in front of an audience?
KL: The transition has been fairly simple but a personal concern of mine, which was never a problem with film, was having to work on my vocal energy for the stage since I have a naturally quiet voice. The initial moment of stepping on stage in front of an audience was overwhelming, but it took me only a few shows to begin embracing them. Now it feels almost impossible to do a show without their presence.
FM: How did you tap into your character’s emotional state in the play? Are there any tricks that help you get into character?
KL: It’s not been overly difficult to tap into my character’s emotional state in this particular play. Unlike film, the narrative progresses in chronological order, so I am able to live through Er Hong’s experiences as a child right up until she becomes an adult, which has given me the necessary time for the emotions to develop as the story unfolds.
FM: “Wild Swans” will also be staged at the Young Vic Theatre in London. Have you noticed any differences between performing in the U.S. and performing in England?
KL: From my time performing at the A.R.T., I have noticed that the American audience is quite vocally responsive, which has been very helpful in gauging the flow and reaction of the play as well as boosting our performances as actors. Currently it’s hard to imagine [if] the British, who are known to be more reserved, will respond in the same way, but I could be completely wrong. It will be interesting to find out.

If you haven’t needed to borrow a dress for a particular occasion in the past few weeks, you might not have heard about The Social Dresswork, a new site that allows Harvard women (and men, if they so desire) to rent dresses from one another. Already the home of the famous Social Network, it seems Social __works of all kinds are springing up around campus. Join us as FM predicts the future of these sites around campus.
Fifteen Minutes: So, Dan, you created the Social Roomwork. Explain the basic premise to us.
Daniel X. Wesson: Well, The Social Roomwork, or TSR as I’m hoping people will call it, is a website designed to help students switch between houses on the Harvard campus. As I’m sure you’re aware, some students, usually those in the quad, try to transfer houses each year. However, many of their requests get denied. Our goal is to circumvent the university by connecting students who wish to sleep in certain houses with open beds in those locations.
FM: Cool! And how do you do that?
DW: Well, there’s a list of students looking for transfers that we’re hoping to obtain.
FM: You’re hoping to obtain?
DW: Yeah. The administration doesn’t want to release any personal documents to us—not yet, at least—so right now all we have are rumors of which students want to transfer. But that’s just a temporary setback.
FM: Sure...just details.
DW: Right. Anyways, we have that list, and we’re also creating a list of people who might have open beds. The plan is to match up people on the two lists so they can meet each other and create better rooming situations.
FM: Okay. And how might you create a list of open beds?
DW: I mean, there are lots of reasons why beds are left empty at night. Some kids go on trips a lot. Some kids get it on in other people’s beds a lot. Some kids just don’t like their roommates. Basically, I’m hoping to install cameras in each room on campus.
FM: Sorry, what?
DW: I’m hoping to install cameras in each room on campus.
FM: Of course you are. Why would I have thought otherwise? Continue.
DW: Anyways, the cameras aren’t intrusive. I’m sure people will forget they’re there.
FM: Will they?
DW: Yeah, of course. You won’t see anything. I’ll just know when you’re sleeping in your bed so I don’t send random people there.
FM: So just to be clear—you want to put cameras in my room so that when I’m not there, you can send Currier and Cabot kids to sleep in my bed?
DW: Yep! It should be up and running soon.
FM: I’m not sure how I feel about that. Have you run the whole camera idea past the administration yet?
DW: I sent them an email but I haven’t heard back yet. I’m not sure why—I was very explicit that I have no intention to start occupy movements in any of the rooms. That should put me in the clear for this, right?
TSR should go live in the next few days, so don’t be alarmed if someone shows up at your door soon with a camera to install.

Sydney Nathans looked at the doorbell, and hesitated. Here he was, in Glastonbury, Conn., several hundred miles from his home in North Carolina and outside of a stranger’s home.
He had come to further investigate the life and family of Mary Walker, a fugitive slave. Nathans, a retired professor at Duke University, started this study back in 1988, and afterwards published his findings in “To Free a Family.” After discovering that Walker’s descendents lived in Glastonbury, Nathans wanted to ask if they knew of Walker, and to learn about their history. On that day, however, Nathans did not dare to ring the bell.
Although more than a century old, Walker’s story is one worth remembering. After escaping slavery, she became a part of Cambridge’s history, settling here in the 1850s. She later owned 54 (now 56) Brattle Street—today the Cambridge Center for Adult Education.
Nathans also hoped to meet Walker’s descendents because he wanted to share one of his most interesting findings: a change in their racial history. The 1870 and 1880 censuses listed the Walker descendants as “mulatto,” but starting in 1900, when the census only gave the options of “white” and “black,” the Walkers began identifying as “white.”
Eventually, Nathans made contact with the Walker descendants. When they finally met, Nathans brought an album of photos. The first picture was of Mary Walker’s Brattle Street house. Clare Dubé, the second oldest member of the family, immediately recognized it as her Uncle Freddie’s house. Frederick Gray Walker was Mary Walker’s mixed-race grandson, who Clare had always thought was white.
The family was surprised to learn about Mary Walker, and her African American roots. Clare had always felt that there was a secret in the family, and learning about Walker filled in many gaps her parents had never explained.
TO THE HOUSE
Mary Walker was born in 1818 on a plantation owned by a man named Duncan Cameron. Walker was very fair-skinned. She eventually learned to read and write. In 1846, Walker accompanied Cameron and his sickly daughter to Philadelphia on the first of three medical trips. On the last trip in 1848, Mary Walker ran away.
In Philadelphia, Walker was safe under the 1847 Personal Liberty Law, which granted a path to freedom for slaves brought into the state. There she met James Lesley, who employed her: she was a skilled seamstress. When Walker’s security was threatened under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, Lesley helped her move to Boston. There she found refuge with Lesley’s cousin. Although safe at last, Walker was heartbroken.
Running away meant an end to her life as a slave, but it also meant leaving behind her mother and three children. Now she missed her family, and she began to fear for them after discovering in 1853 that Duncan Cameron had died, leaving her children’s fates uncertain.
As a result, over the next decade, Mary Walker devoted herself to freeing her children. The Lesleys pursued three rescue efforts to no avail. In 1852, Walker’s eldest son Frank escaped, but was unable to reach her. It was only after the Civil War that Mary Walker was reunited with her two remaining children, Agnes and Bryant.
Mary Walker found a life for herself in Cambridge, where she had made many friends and developed a reputation for her sewing skills. Walker became a part of Cambridge’s history in June 1870, when a relative of a woman she had nursed purchased a house on 54 Brattle Street for her.
Now known as the Blacksmith House, 54 Brattle Street was no ordinary house. It had been the home of Dexter Pratt, the man immortalized in Henry Wadsworth Longwell’s poem “The Village Blacksmith.” Mary Walker’s family lived in this house for 42 years.
LOST AND FOUND
Mary Walker’s grandson and Clare’s uncle Frederick Walker finally sold the Brattle Street house in 1912. Sydney Nathans notes that as the financial equities of the house were passed onto future generations, the property became Mary Walker’s gift to her descendants. She granted her children the security and stability she never had.
From 1912 to 1946, the Brattle Street house became a popular restaurant among students. Then, from 1946 to 1972, it was a philanthropic enterprise called The Window Shop, which provided vocational training and a place to sell food and products for World War II refugees. Eventually, in 1972, the Cambridge Center for Adult Education acquired the building and has owned it ever since. Despite her early prominence, Mary Walker’s history remains largely unknown now, a century later.
Her story became lost to Cambridge history and the Walker descendents during the currents of racial prejudice in the early 1900s. In this context of heightened racial tension, the Walker descendents decided not to reveal Mary Walker’s African-American identity to their light-skinned children. “I think my mother didn’t know how to explain that,” said Dubé.
And so it became lost in their family history. “By keeping it from the children,” said Nathans, “it was a secret [the children] didn’t have to keep themselves.”
Today, Mary Walker’s story, uncovered largely through Nathans’ work, is celebrated both in the Cambridge community and among Walker’s descendants. Last Thursday, people crowded into the Cambridge Center for Adult Education to hear Nathans’ talk on “To Free a Family.”
Nathans has also become a friend to the Walker descendants, who have embraced Mary Walker’s story with pride. “To learn one’s history...” said Andrea Kenney, Mary Walker’s great-great-great granddaughter, “... I was enriched and thrilled.”
Even the youngest member of the family, Leland Gutkin, is proud of Mary Walker. “She was very courageous,” he said.

President: How many petitions have we collected for today?
Freshman Rep.: Forty-three! Sorry, but I took a break to sleep last Tuesday.
President: Great, just shred them. Next issue on the agenda. What do what we want to do with the results of the HUDS satisfaction survey?
Student Rep.: After running several algorithms and a Doodle poll, we’ve found that adding five minutes to the third brain break of every month would make a huge difference in overall student satisfaction. Let’s prepare another survey over the next few months.
President: Excellent!
Student Rep.: Actually, to be honest, sometimes I just feel really frustrated. You know, after 375 years of Harvard running okay, who am I to try to effect big change?
President: You know what? My freshman year, I organized a task force that would appoint a committee to oversee the feasibility of creating a different committee that would start an investigation into the possibility of a student center.
Student Rep.: No way! As a freshman?!
President: Yeah...well, it was my freshman project. And my sophomore project...and my junior one, too.
IOP
President: It’s official. We’ve been banned from all of the lists other than the Meditation Club because they’re too zen to ban us, and Crimson Key because they can’t figure out how to. Alternative spamming ideas?
Study Group Director: What if we partnered with HUDS? Customized waffle irons, maybe?
Student Outreach Coordinator: Nah, my friends tried it out once for the Veritas Financial Group. You can only get one word on the iron. Complete waste of money.
Study Group Director: That doesn’t matter, because I’ve just perfected our Facebook event invite: Palatino Linotype. Forty-eight point type. At least seven different colors. Alternating italics and bold, highlighting in a color that reduces contrast, and a five paragraph essay on the study group leader.
Student Outreach Coordinator: Great! Just keep the Facebook invites coming every three minutes.
HoCo
President: Awesome attendance this week from non-HoCo members! Thanks for coming by, Charlie!
Social Coordinator: I know we usually only argue over our theme for Stein Club, but today we need to discuss the Housing Day video.
President: You’re right. This will be the foundation of our entire legacy as a committee. Remember last year? They got 46 views and three likes. I know it’s a daunting task, but I think we can match it.
Social Coordinator: I want something ground-breaking. How about, “This Isn’t a Quad House?”
President: Oh, and maybe we could get Dean Hammonds to make a cameo!
Social Coordinator: Don’t be ridiculous. No one’s seen her in years.

Fifteen Minutes sat down for five questions with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86. Duncan was the co-captain of the men’s varsity basketball team and is now one of President Obama’s closest advisors. His controversial work on education reform has been making headlines across the country.
1. Fifteen Minutes: What do you think is the single biggest thing that a school or school district can do to improve education?
Arne S. Duncan '86: I wish there were one. There’s not just one. I think talent matters tremendously in attracting and retaining great teachers. Great principals, particularly in disadvantaged communities, are hugely important. I think great early childhood education is hugely important. And I think building a culture around college readiness for all students—college and career readiness—so that the goal is not just to graduate. The goal is some form of education beyond senior year of high school. Those would be at the top of my list. But you really have to have this cradle to career continuum.
2. FM: Do you think that pay incentives are a good way of making that happen?
ASD: I think as a piece of a much larger conversation about support and professional development and status and career ladders, changing the compensation system is important. By itself, it is not the issue. The biggest determinant of teacher success or longevity is actually their principals and their peers. Where you have a great principal who supports you and mentors you, those teachers stay. And where you have a bad principal, you could pay a teacher a million dollars and they won’t stay.
3. FM: What do you think you will have had to accomplish, in your time in Washington, for you to feel like you did everything you went there to do?
ASD: All our work—early childhood, K to 12 reform, higher ed.—all our work is towards one goal. The president has challenged us to lead the world in college graduation rates by 2020. We used to be first; we’re now sixteenth. There are all these countries that have passed us by, and so that’s how I want to be held accountable. Can we again lead the world in college graduation rates? If we do that, I think the benefits for families and communities in the country and our country’s economy are huge. If we continue to languish and have other countries out-educate us, we’re going to continue to be out-competed and continue to struggle. So that, for me, is the ultimate goal: to lead the world in college graduation rates.
4. FM: How involved is the president in what you do?
ASD: This is a deeply, deeply personal battle for him. He says all the time, “If I hadn’t had a great school and great teachers, who knows what would have happened?” And he’s been an amazing partner. We’re lucky we were able to work a lot together before we came to Washington—first when he was in the Illinois state legislature and then when he was an Illinois senator. We used to talk policy, we used to visit schools together, and he’s driven this country in just an amazingly remarkable way. I think no one would have predicted how far we would’ve come in the three years of his presidency.
5. FM: Have you been following the basektball team much? [At the time of this interview, the Crimson basketball team was ranked twenty-first in the nation.]
ASD: I’m so proud of what they’re doing and the program Coach Amaker is building. I got to a game last year that was really fun to see, and obviously they had a tough end to the season last year, but they’ve come back really strong.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over 100 people gathered in front of Somerville High School to protest service cuts and fare increases proposed by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Services before a public hearing with the MBTA scheduled to be held on Tuesday.
The proposed cuts come as the MBTA attempts to eliminate a projected deficit of $161 million for fiscal year 2013. Currently, the MBTA is considering two proposals, one of which would include the elimination of six bus lines in Somerville, including the 96 bus that stops at Tufts University and Davis Square on its way to Harvard Square. The MBTA has planned to host 20 public meetings in January, February, and March in order to discuss the proposed cuts.
Karen A. Narefsky ’11, a Somerville resident who attended the rally, said she thought the purpose of the rally was to bring the community together in the face of the proposed MBTA cuts.
“Officials at the MBTA know already that people are angry,” Narefsky said.  “What was really powerful was having people speak from a lot of different groups about how this affects them and how this affects their lives—hopefully this can be a basis for organizing.”
Narefsky said that she and many other Somerville residents believe the MBTA plan to cut service in the area is misguided.
“It’s crazy to talk about cutting service in Somerville because Somerville is actually underserved—it’s a dense city and there’s just not enough buses or train services,” Narefsky said. “The government is taking the easy way out by forcing riders to pay off the debt rather than asking the state legislature and the banks that hold the loans to renegotiate.”
Jackson F. Cashion ’13 agreed with Narefsky’s assessment. Though he did not attend the rally in Somerville, he has been actively involved in protesting MBTA cuts in the past.
“The real solution to the MBTA budget lies with the legislature, not with cutting service that lots of people rely on every day,” Cashion said. “What the T should be doing is lobbying the legislature to fix some of the economic inefficiencies that have created the terrible financial scenario.”
Cashion also mentioned that he—and a “solid contingent” of protestors—believe that the cuts will unfairly target socially disadvantaged citizens.
“Any fare increase is going to have a negative effect on people who are struggling to pay for public transportation as it is, especially in poor communities,” he said. “In Somerville, for some people, public transportation may not be affordable anymore.”
The public hearing for Cambridge will take place Thursday at 6 p.m. at the Cambridge City Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents workers of the Harvard Club of Boston, postponed its picket originally scheduled for Tuesday in anticipation of renewed contract negotiations next week with Harvard Club management.
On Sunday, the union’s Harvard Club Bargaining Committee decided to postpone the picket after management asked to meet with the union early next week.
Brian Lang, the president of the union, said that he was “hopeful” that negotiations on Monday and Tuesday will be more productive than they had in the past.
“I’m open-minded,” Lang said. “We’ll see what happens.”
Union representative Dana Simon said that negotiations so far have been characterized by disrespect on the part of club management.
“Management has given us their assurance that this bargaining will be real,” Simon said. “We don’t know if that will happen.”
The union has rescheduled the protest for next Wednesday at 5pm at the club.
The Harvard Club of Boston is not associated with Harvard University, but is open to Harvard graduates and graduates of “selected affiliate colleges and universities,” according to its website. A spokesperson for the club did not return a request for comment.
Simon said that the union and the club have been trying to come up with a new contract since July of last year.
“It’s pretty unusual that bargaining goes on for the better part of a year,” Simon said.
Last October, the National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against the club for failing to provide required information during the negotiating process.
The negotiating process has been further marred by a complaint by the union to the NLRB accusing the club of threatening workers and engaging in illegal surveillance to prevent them from participating in union activities. Additionally, the club’s wait staff has filed a lawsuit against the management alleging that it charged patrons a gratuity fee, but never passed that money along to its workers.
“[The lawsuit] is a symbol of the way club management has disrespected workers,” Simon said. “They’ve just been taking their money.”
In addition, the club has not offered to increase wages, at least for now, according to Simon.
“People are having a very tough time paying their rent, paying their mortgages,” Simon said.
Student Labor Action Movement member William P. Whitham ’14 said that while interning for the union over the summer, he witnessed some of the negotiations with the club, which he called “very frustrating.”
“It’s not purely an ethical thing. It also has to do with this very basic idea of fair and respectful negotiations,” Whitham said. “Management was showing disrespect both in and out of negotiations.”
Whitham said that he was planning on attending the picket Tuesday but was happy to hear that the club had said it would meet with union negotiators.
“I’m glad that the threat of a picket had this effect,” Whitham said. “I just hope that their attitude has changed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the collective star power of Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, Deepak Chopra, and more special guests amasses inside Sanders Theatre for the launch of a new anti-bullying foundation on Wednesday, protesters will gather outside to ask Harvard to shine a spotlight on a long-gone group of people as well.
The rally is planned by a group of activists formed in June 2010 under the banner “Their Day in the Yard” to demand that Harvard issue degrees  to seven students expelled for perceived homosexuality in 1920.
The students—two of whom committed suicide after their expulsion—were the victims of an investigation into gay activity at Harvard by a body that has come to be known as the “Secret Court” since a Crimson editor uncovered its existence in 2002.
Since then, the episode has become the focus of two plays as well as the Their Day in the Yard movement.
“We are calling for posthumous honorary degrees,” said the founder of Their Day in the Yard, who wished to remain anonymous. She noted that Harvard officials have said that posthumous degrees are reserved for the rare students who complete all their graduation requirements but die before claiming their diplomas.
“It is our understanding that honorary degree recipients do not need to have attended Harvard at all,” the movement’s founder said. “These students have been so disgraced by the University—we would like to see Harvard return some of their honor.”
The rally will start at 3 p.m., an hour before the event at which Lady Gaga will officially kick-start her new organization, the Born This Way Foundation.
The founder emphasized that although her group’s latest protest will take place outside of Lady Gaga’s event on Wednesday, the rally is not meant to protest the pop star’s visit to campus.
“We’re seeking the support of the Born This Way Foundation. We’re hoping that they urge Harvard to abolish the Secret Court and grant posthumous honorary degrees,” she said.
Sociology lecturer Kaia Stern, a supporter of the movement, said that Their Day in the Yard “loves Lady Gaga and the work that she is doing.”

Many of the online search, information evaluation, and creation skills that shape students’ academic activity are actually developed in their personal and social lives, according to a study conducted by The Berkman Center for Internet and Society. The two-year study on the intersection of youth, digital media, and information quality is the first formal analysis of these issues.
“If you look at online safety or privacy stuff, I think schools have already started to respond to that quite a bit,” said Urs Gasser, executive director of The Berkman Center and principal researcher for its Youth and Digital Media: From Credibility to Information Quality study. “But here, where arguably it’s as critical a skill to find stuff online and have to sort through it and make judgments about the quality, that’s still not even on the radar. That’s the finding that bothers me the most.”
Gasser said that an important first step is for educators, administrators, students, and parents to start a conversation about information quality and Internet use both in and out of school.
“The system has to work with students about how they use and interact with information...as opposed to being led to junk and just saying, ‘You’re on your own to figure out what’s good and what’s bad,’” said June A. Casey, a Harvard Law School Research Librarian who collaborated on the study.
Casey suggested that education about classifying high quality information should be seamlessly integrated into curricula and that after spending 10 to 15 minutes searching for information, students should ask a research librarian for help.
However, some schools are limiting access to potentially useful information, making rules or using URL blacklists to restrict student access to certain websites at school. According to Gasser, students use many of those sites to find information. Even teachers have pushed back against such rules. In August, the Missouri State Teacher’s Association sued the state for trying to ban social networking between teachers and students.
“You basically cut off this very important activity and reinforce the delegation to the personal and social space outside of school instead of trying to incorporate it and have conversation around it,” Gasser said.
Just this month, several website publishers that direct resources to lesbian, bi-sexual, gay, and transgender youth sued a school district for filtering its content as inappropriate for “sexuality” while allowing access to anti-LGBT materials labeled under “religion.”
Instead of creating laws or rules that mandate Internet usage, Gasser recommended that policy-makers help schools develop innovative approaches and curricula to incorporate digital technology and ensure that they have the requisite resources.
The Berkman Center’s Youth and Media lab has already built and tested five curriculum modules focused on information quality and hopes to continue it’s research.
“This is a starting point, this report, and I hope it stimulates a discussion within the research community,” said Gasser. “This is an important as well as interesting topic.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will receive input from Allston residents to help them decide on a third-party developer for the Housing Commons and Barry’s Corner Retail at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting Wednesday. Task-Force members said that, in addition to deciding on a developer, they hope to receive more concrete details from Harvard about the Barry’s Corner complex and the Allston Science Center.
Task Force Chair Ray V. Mellone said that aiding Harvard’s search for a developer who will balance both Harvard’s and the community’s goals will be a prominent feature of the meeting.
“It’s important that we engage in a give and take with Harvard,” Mellone said. “I think that Harvard’s interests and the community’s interests can be aligned, and we want to help them choose a developer who can bring our shared goals to life.”
In 2005, the University announced that it would foster the development of a “main street” environment on Western Avenue, including Barry’s Corner, which sits on the corner of Western Ave. and North Harvard Street. But this vision was put on hold when Harvard’s tumbling endowment compelled the University to indefinitely pause the construction of its Allston Science Complex in Dec. 2009.
Harvard resumed planning for Allston in 2011, when the Harvard Corporation and University President Drew G. Faust approved recommendations for development made by the Harvard Allston Work Team. The Work Team, which dissolved thereafter, comprised a group of Harvard faculty charged with the task of analyzing Harvard’s Allston holdings after the construction freeze.
In Sept. 2011, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced that the University would move forward with the first phase of its new plan, which is set to include developing the Barry’s Corner area, devising a new design for a science center, and planning for the land on which the current Charlesview Apartment Complex sits.
Task Force member Brent C. Whelan ’73 emphasized the importance of establisihing a “joint project” between Harvard and Allston residents in moving forward with a developer for Barry’s Corner.
He said that the primary goal of many Allston residents is to ensure that Harvard does not push its own agenda while leaving Allston residents’ voice out of the planning process.
“We’re going to push for a larger commitment on Harvard’s part to develop our community and not just develop its particular projects,” Whelan said.
Whelan added that many residents hope Harvard will reveal more details of its plans for Barry’s Corner.
“With Barry’s Corner, we’re hoping to get to the part where we can talk substantively about an integrative housing complex,” Whelan said. “Harvard was pretty elusive last time, so hopefully we can get something more tangible this time.”
But for Task Force Member Rita M. DiGesse, the meeting tomorrow night will have a different focus. She said that she—and many other Allston residents—want to make sure that Harvard commits to finishing its science center before it takes on another development project.
“Harvard has talked about buildings and apartments, and there’s a lot to be looked into there,” she said. “I think the priority for a lot of people is that, before they do all that, they give us a break and finish the Science Center.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sarah likes it when her hands are tied to the bedpost and a bar is secured between her knees, spreading them apart. During sex, her boyfriend dominates her roped body as she happily calls him “sir” and “master.” She asks her boyfriend to objectify her and call her derogatory terms.
For Sarah, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, the pain from the ropes is not what turns her on. Sarah is kinky, which for her means enjoying losing control of the situation, and even control over her own body.
Within the kink community, Sarah identifies as a “sub,” short for submissive, and she thinks it’s hot when her body’s movements are in someone else’s hands. She says having kinky sex allows her to escape “from the pressures of having to be this Madonna-whore thing, where I’m supposed to know what I’m doing but I’m also not supposed to want to do any of it.”
Sarah says she openly discusses these desires with Harvard peers who have similar kinks during “munch,” an informal lunch meeting for kinky people.
Sarah and other members believe participating in and discussing kinky sex is a way to deconstruct what they dub the “sexual script”: making out, taking off clothes, having intercourse, and going to sleep. For them, it peels away the taboo cloaking students’ ability to freely analyze and critique rules about sex.
“MUNCH”
Last semester Michael, whose name has been changed to protect his privacy, noticed that he was having the same conversations about kinky sex with different people. He knew that munches are hosted in the kink community at large, and decided it would be a good idea to bring these students together over lunch. He began organizing events for kinky Harvard students and is currently in the process of trying to form a recognized student group.
Michael says there are twenty students on the fledgling group’s email list, and that most members’ kinks fall on the BDSM spectrum—an initialism that stands for bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadism and masochism.
“Or, as my crude definition states, it’s tying people up, telling them to do stuff, and hitting them with things,” Michael says jokingly.
Justin J. Lehmiller, a lecturer in Harvard’s psychology department and a sex columnist, says that this is a normal part of human sexual expression. He says he believes that students should learn about the diversity that exists in sexual behavior.
“People are by no means limited to performing one sexual act,” Lehmiller says. “People like to pretend that [kinky sex] doesn’t happen, but the reality is that it does.”
But the members’ interests do not encompass the broad spectrum that is kink. Indeed, the word “kinky” means to participate in unusual sexual behavior which, Michael explains, can entail anything from having sex in a location other than the bedroom to having a fetish. A fetish, while may be part of a kink, refers to an obsession with a particular object, idea, or body part conventionally not viewed as sexual.
Michael identifies as a “dom,” short for dominant. He likes to be the one tying the ropes, talking dirty, and “punishing” his partner. Jill, a student who regularly attends munch and whose name has been changed to protect her privacy, says she’s a sub and has had rape fantasies since she was young.
Kinky people also include furries, who, according to Michael, dress up or identify with anthropomorphic animal figures “either as a lifestyle thing or as a sexual product.”
There are also “eaters and feeders” who derive pleasure from, as the name suggests, eating and feeding. But interaction can be more than simply feeding your partner chocolate covered strawberries and can entail force-feeding or feeding someone with the intention that they will gain weight.
Michael and Jill say sexual role-play is more about power dynamics in the bedroom than actually deriving pleasure from pain. Jill says that for her, being a sub includes cooking and dressing up for her boyfriend, not because those acts are sexually arousing but because she knows they will make him happy.
“There’s a conceptual line that gets drawn,” Michael says, about what constitutes a kink. As an example, he says that a man who likes his partner’s feet is often characterized as having a fetish, whereas a man who likes his partner’s legs is not.
“You begin to question where that line comes from,” he adds.
‘YES MEANS YES’
Sarah remembers freaking out during kinky sex only once. It was the night she and her boyfriend were using more ropes than usual and, she says, she was not in the right mindset.
“That’s why you keep scissors right there, to cut people out fast,” she says, adding that her boyfriend helped her as soon as she appeared distressed.
Sarah says that when she has kinky sex she enters “sub-space”—a mental state a sub may enter during role-play. Sarah says that in sub-space, she ceases to feel physical pain.
“It’s important to check in about limits before you start playing,” she says. “If someone doesn’t feel comfortable with something beforehand, they might agree to it in sub-space.”
At that point, it is up to the dominant partner to respect previously agreed upon boundaries.
For kinky people, communication and trust is key in determining what risks to take and boundaries to set, as well as maximizing pleasure.
“BDSM is not an acceptable cover for abuse,” Michael says, explaining that consent is the key ingredient that differentiates it from abuse.
CONFLICTING IDENTITIES
Mollena Williams, an educator in the kink and BDSM community for 15 years, says that kinky sex increases self-awareness because it forces individuals to be transparent with themselves and their partners about what pleases them. Williams, who refers to herself as “The Perverted Negress,” will discuss safe kinky sex at Harvard during Sex Week in late March.
“Sometimes what I deserve is a really nice spanking because it turns me on,” Williams says, explaining that she is the ultimate authority on what gives her pleasure. “It’s hot and it’s sexy.”
That self-awareness allows kinky students to negotiate seemingly conflicting parts of their identities.
Jill says she is fully aware that being submissive to her boyfriend during sex can appear to be anti-feminist. But Jill says she believes her sexual interests have nothing to do with her ideological beliefs or her opinions outside of her sexual interactions.
“The way feminists talk about how consent is really important to sex, well it’s really important to kinky sex too,” Jill says, adding that she considers herself to be a feminist.
Kink sex, for her, is an expression of affection.
“I like being told that I’m a slut or good for nothing but sex...But when you tell me I’m a whore, what you’re really saying is I love you,” she says.
Williams also identifies as a sub and says that being a feminist is having the capability to operate outside individuals’ designated roles in society.
“There’s nothing easy about saying ‘what fulfills me is being submissive,’ but that doesn’t mean I’m submissive to the world,” Williams says.
REMOVING THE TABOO
At the time of the interview Sarah had come back from having sex with her boyfriend in Widener. For her, having sex outside the bedroom, as well as the thrill of potentially being caught made the experience kinky.
She says that having kinky sex increased her confidence because it allowed her to be comfortable owning and articulating her needs and desires.
“There’s also the very straightforward confidence you get from being treated like someone’s sex toy,” she adds. “Being able to turn someone else on in a very primal and objective sense...feels great.”
Members of the kink community say that participating in, and talking about, kinky sex can open up the discussion about sex on campus. In doing so, they say they hope to deconstruct the notion that sex has to proceed in a particular direction.
“Teaching yourself to talk about [variations in sex] can be helpful and meaningful,” Michael says.
At the same time Michael, Jill, and Sarah say they understand that their friends and family may not care to know about their sexual practices. All three asked to remain anonymous to protect their friends, not because they are ashamed.
“Everyone is secretly kinky,” Michael laughs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The College will purchase common room furniture with which to furnish all Quincy House suites next fall in order to alleviate the need for summer storage space when the renovation of Old Quincy begins this June, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith announced Tuesday in a statement on the FAS website.
Each Quincy common room will be equipped with two chairs, two tables, and a sofa or loveseat, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Although Quincy also has limited storage space in the Adams House Pool Theatre, in the past Quincy residents have stored most of their belongings in a large space in the basement of Old Quincy over the summer.
But when construction begins on Old Quincy in June, this storage space will become unusable.
Although Tuesday’s statement was the first time the news had been announced publicly to the Harvard community, Quincy residents were informed of the plan nearly three months ago.
In a Dec. 8 email to Quincy residents, Quincy House Masters Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke announced that the College will pay for Quincy residents to store some belongings at an off-site storage facility.
Eligible students, who live more than 150 miles from campus, will be limited to a maximum of four boxes of 3.5 to 4 cubic feet and one small piece of furniture, such as a lamp or chair.
Students who wish to store larger common room furniture will be able to store those items with a local storage vendor at a discounted price, Hammonds and Smith wrote in their joint statement.
Quincy residents say there are both positives and negatives to the College’s plan to purchase common furniture.
“It will definitely help people whose parents can’t help them move in and out,” Quincy resident Charlene C. Lee ’14 said.
But until more specifics are announced, Lee says she is withholding judgment.
“Part of [roommate] bonding is decorating our room, so if it’s an ugly couch it might be worse,” she added.
In their Dec. 8 email, the Quincy House Masters wrote that the design of this furniture “is being selected with input from a committee of your peers.”
The new common room furniture will be “tested” in Quincy next academic year, with an eye toward expanding the program for all Houses that will be renovated in future years, the FAS website said.
Quincy is the first of Harvard’s 12 Houses to undergo construction as part of the University’s House Renewal project, which will dramatically revamp undergraduate dormitories.
As part of the renovations, Old Quincy’s current storage space will be remodeled to include social spaces, music practice rooms, and a classroom.
When Old Quincy reopens in the fall of 2013, the new suites in the renovated space will also be outfitted with the common room furniture.
“I think it’s good that they are going to be providing furniture. I don’t necessarily like the fact that we won’t have storage space in the future as we did in the past,” Quincy resident Maria K. C. O’Bryne ’14 said. “It’s going to be difficult for people who already have furniture and don’t live nearby.”
Currently, Harvard College provides a bed, desk, bureau, and bookcase to all undergraduates living on campus. Under the existing system, students are expected to purchase their own common room furniture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Renovation of Old Quincy will kick off with about 15 hours of construction each work day this summer, Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 announced in an email sent to the Leverett House community Monday morning.
When students return to campus in the fall, the construction will begin at 8 a.m. rather than the tentative summer start time of 7 a.m. each work day, Georgi wrote.
“I don’t usually wake up at that hour,” said Quincy resident Hania S. Chima ’14, who said she hopes to live in New Quincy next year regardless of the nearby morning noise. “I guess it’s something I can deal with.”
Quincy House, which will be the first House remodeled as part of the College’s extensive House Renewal project, will divide its residents during the renovationdivide its residents during the renovation among five buildings—including “swing space” apartments above Massachusetts Ave.—during the upcoming academic year.
In his email, Georgi broke the construction schedule into a four-phase chronology stretching from this upcoming summer to spring 2013.
The plans have been “worked out in great detail,” Georgi wrote in his email to Leverett students and tutors. “But you should be aware that unexpected things could happen to make it even worse.”
According to Georgi, the first phase of construction on Old Quincy will begin soon after Commencement and last until late July.
This phase, which Georgi described as “quite disruptive,” will tentatively take place from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. each work day.
In an interview with The Crimson, Georgi said that construction will conclude in the mid- to late-afternoon when school starts up again in the fall.
Georgi described a scene of busy summer construction, writing that temporary barriers, fencing, and heavy trucks will crowd the streets surrounding Quincy House.
Students staying in Quincy during the summer will be unable to access either Mill St. or DeWolfe St. from the gates from Quincy courtyard, Georgi wrote.
In the second stage of construction, lasting from late July until mid-November, Georgi wrote that he anticipates that access from the main entrance of the House to DeWolfe St. will be restored.
When the third stage of construction begins in mid-November, the “heaviest traffic” of trucks and outside work will diminish, while construction will pick up inside Old Quincy.
The fourth stage will stretch from March until the expected conclusion of the renovation in June.
Georgi’s email came a day before Leverett House juniors were required to submit their preferences for next year’s rooming arrangements.
In his email, Georgi wrote, “Because we will be right next to a major construction site, the plans [for the construction on Old Quincy] might affect the housing lottery, so I wanted to get the word out to you right away.”
Quincy resident Eric R. Brewster ’14 said he did not expect to be fazed by construction.
“They have a job to do, and they want to complete the project in a reasonable time frame,” Brewster said. “No one wants to deal with the annoyances that construction entails, but it’s for a good purpose, and in the long run, it has to happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Massachusetts Republicans will not weigh in on the presidential nominating race until next Tuesday, a group of Harvard University employees have already let their checkbooks do some of the talking.
Documents made available online by the Federal Election Commission (FEC) last week show that a group of 17 donors on the Harvard payroll combined to give over $25,000 to Republican campaigns for president through the end of January.
The vast majority of that money, $23,150, was donated to the campaign of former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Libertarian Ron Paul drew $3,103 from just three Harvard employees. Both Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum failed to solicit any donations from Harvard employees.
It comes as little surprise that Romney is leading other Republicans in fundraising here, Harvard professors said.
In addition to having gained the support of most of his party’s leadership, Romney’s ties to the University are stronger than those of any of his contenders.
Romney earned degrees at both Harvard Business and Law School in the 1970s.  As governor of Massachusetts from 2003-2007, he frequently had direct contact with Harvard and its professors.
Accordingly, most of the support Romney has found at Harvard has been at the business school or from professors who worked with him when he was governor.
HBS professor Michael E. Porter served as an official advisor to Romney’s campaign four years ago, leading his Global Competitiveness Policy Advisory Group. Though not an official Romney advisor this time around, Porter has thus far given the campaign $2,500.
Porter declined to comment on his involvement in the current campaign.
Clayton M. Christensen, a HBS professor and Mormon, is a close friend of Romney’s. He donated $2,500 to the campaign last year and has written and spoken on several occasions about how Mormon faith might affect a potential Romney presidency.
Harvard policy prohibits institutional endorsement of a candidate, but several high profile University leaders have backed Romney thus far, including HBS Director of Executive Education Ralph M. James and Director of Private Equity for the Harvard Management Company Peter F. Dolan.
Support for Ron Paul, though not widespread, has still been lucrative.
Amir M. Mikhak, an FAS web developer, has donated to the campaign, volunteered at phone banks, and is planning to run as a delegate to the national convention.
The FEC numbers only represent individual itemized contributions made by donors who reported working at Harvard.
Though Republicans are finding support here, Harvard has historically been a treasure trove for Democrats. President Barack Obama raised over $875,000 last time around making Harvard employees his third-largest donor. The President has already raised over $100,000 for his campaign this time around.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders from the undergraduate LGBTQ community met with researchers from the Berkman Center for Internet and Society and affiliates from the Born This Way Foundation Tuesday morning to provide their input on the foundation’s initiatives.
The Born This Way Foundation, a charity spearheaded by Lady Gaga and Harvard University, will be launched Wednesday at a Graduate School of Education event in Sanders Theater. Guests joining Lady Gaga include Oprah Winfrey, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen G. Sebelius, and law professor Charles J. Ogletree.
Tuesday’s meeting with student leaders was planned to provide board members of the Born This Way foundation with insight from the Harvard LGBTQ community, according to law professor and Co-director of the Berkman Center John G. Palfrey ’94.
“The foundation is being set up in the right way by doing its homework first and finding out how to intervene,” Palfrey said.
However, some students have expressed concern that undergraduates were not given the opportunity to participate in the foundation and its launch at Harvard. Though the Undergraduate Council and the Graduate School of Education have raffled off a handful of tickets to the event, and the event will be streamed live online, few undergraduates will attend the premiere in Sanders Theater.
In an email to The Crimson, Graduate School of Education spokesperson Michael G. Rodman wrote that though he wishes the school could accommodate more students and faculty, he is proud to include more than 100 high school and middle school students at the launch.
Scott O. Ahlborn ’12, co-director of the peer-counseling organization Contact, said the administration should have made the event more inclusive of undergraduates because bullying, the focus of Born This Way, is an issue pertinent to college students as well as high school and middle school students.
He added that he believed Tuesday’s meeting was a last minute move to placate the tension between students and the administration for not having a role in the Born This Way.
“While I did appreciate [the meeting] and think it was a great opportunity to express our opinion, still in the back of my mind I felt like it was a way for them to say ‘Oopsies, we’re sorry for not including you,’” Ahlborn said.
However, several LGBTQ group leaders said that they were less bothered by the foundation’s failure to include more undergraduates in the launch.
Queer Students and Allies co-chair Trevor N. Coyle ’14 said that though he is personally disappointed that he won’t be able to attend, he does not feel entitled to participate.
“I don’t think I deserve to be there more than anyone else because I am from an LGBTQ group,” Coyle said.  “I am just grateful to Gaga because I think the issues will be raised simply because she and Oprah are there.”
Gay, Lesbian, or Whatever (GLOW) co-chair Laura V. Herrera ’13 expressed similar sentiments to Coyle. Herrera said the researchers appeared incredibly open to their ideas and directions for the foundation and thanked Lady Gaga for her role in the charity.
“I think with the influence and visibility she has she could really make an impact,” Herrera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2012, at 4:26 a.m.
Princeton University will not reinvest in HEI Hospitality, according to a Tuesday press release from UNITE HERE!, a union that represents hotel and restaurant workers including Harvard University food service workers.
The decision makes Princeton the latest high-profile university to choose not to make further investments in HEI, a hotel chain which has come under fire for repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations. Yale, Brown, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell, Vanderbilt, and Swarthmore have all stated within the last year that they will not reinvest in the company.
Harvard, which has drawn criticism from labor rights activists for investing in HEI as well, announced last December that the University will review HEI’s practices and is “aware of public statements on HEI made by peer institutions,” according to a statement from Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp.
Harvard has yet to announce whether it plans to reinvest in HEI, and University officials declined to comment on Princeton’s announcement on Tuesday.
According to the UNITE HERE! press release, Andrew Golden, president of the Princeton University Investment Company, said at a meeting that the decision came in response to the labor concerns surrounding HEI.
But Martin A. Mbugua, a Princeton spokesperson, said that Golden “was very explicit that this decision was made solely for business reasons.”
“The position was not in any way responsive to the allegations,” Mbugua said.
Official complaints were filed against HEI for mistreatment of employees in 2008, according to UNITE HERE! researcher Riddhi N. Mehta-Neugebauer. HEI-owned Embassy Suites in Irvine, Calif., was found guilty in 2011 of refusing breaks for several workers and has also settled or been found liable for a total of $99,999 on 32 wage and hour complaints.
Over 98 percent of HEI’s funding comes from investments by universities, according to the press release. Princeton’s investments in HEI total at least $94 million, while Harvard’s investments total at least $70 million, the release said.
“If they lose their financial backing, their entire future as a private equity fund is in jeopardy,” Mehta-Neugebauer said. “I think it really gives leverage to hotel workers to come to the table and really puts a lot of pressure on HEI to negotiate in good faith and to respect the workers as well.”
Although Mehta-Neugebauer said that HEI hotel employees are not part of UNITE HERE!, she said that the union stands in solidarity with fellow workers in the hospitality industry. UNITE HERE! has sent emails to administrators at various universities to encourage them not to reinvest in the chain, and representatives of the union met with Lapp in early January.
“What’s alarmed a number of students on college campuses has been these labor violations occurring in the name of these institutions who count themselves as being bastions of moral values and ethics,” Mehta-Neugebauer said.
Brian Lang, president of the UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union’s branch serving the greater Boston area, said that he was not surprised by Princeton’s decision given the number of other universities who have acted similarly.
“It seems to be the wave of what’s happening,” Lang said. “It seems that universities want to keep their arm’s length [from HEI].”
Princeton senior Ian Carlin, a member of Princeton for Workers’ Rights, said that he had been campaigning for this decision for three years.
“I was thrilled and amazed,” Carlin said.
Carlin said that similar decisions made by other universities “definitely gave us hope.”
He said that he hoped and expected Harvard to make the same move sometime in the future.
“I think that will happen sooner or later,” Carlin said.
Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, a member of the Student Labor Action Movement, called Princeton’s choice “a great step forward,” adding that he hopes it might convince Harvard to change its position soon.
“Ivy League colleges have been doing a great job in making HEI look at their practices, but [Harvard] should really be at the forefront of this because it’s so important to the workers and students across the country,” Bayard said.
In the wake of Princeton’s decision, Mehta-Neugebauer said that labor activists’ attention has focused on whether Harvard will follow suit.
“All eyes are really on Harvard to do the right thing now and to really urge HEI to treat its workers fairly,” Mehta-Neugebauer said. “The time is now. There’s plenty of evidence for Harvard to conclude its review process, so hopefully they do that soon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard president Lawrence H. Summers, one of the architects of the Obama administration’s fiscal policies, defended the effectiveness of the president’s response to the financial crisis in a debate with former Bush administration official John B. Taylor.
While Taylor argued that stimulus packages have harmfully increased economic uncertainty, Summers said that fiscal stimulus policies raised employment and economic growth after the 2008 recession.
Taylor said that stimulus measures “may very well be harmful for causing uncertainty, unpredictability, and concerns about future taxes that come from increased deficit.”
But Summers, who served as director of the National Economic Council before returning to Harvard to teach, pointed out a direct correlation between stimulus measures and upticks in the economy, adding that both conservative and liberal economists widely agree that the stimulus was effective.
Summers also said that in studies comparing states that received varying amounts of stimulus money, those that received more money experienced higher levels of job growth.
“Use your common sense,” Summers said. “Do you really believe if we had done nothing in response to the crisis in 2008, it would have been a good idea?”
In contrast, Taylor—a Stanford economics professor who previously served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs—criticized stimulus initiatives as short-term fixes.
“They wither and they don’t give you a lasting recovery,” he said, adding, “It goes away and we are even weaker than before.”
Instead, he advocated long-term solutions like permanent tax credits and government programs designed to encourage efficiency.
“The sooner we get off this track and go back to what we were doing in the ’80s and ’90s, the better our economy will be,” Taylor said.
Summers disagreed, maintaining that the economy is better off in the long run thanks to the government’s stimulus efforts.
“For all of the problems we have, the outcome looks pretty good compared to what happened in Japan, what happened in Scandinavia, and what happened in the United States in 1929,” he said, arguing that policy-makers responded appropriately.
Faced with an extraordinary situation, he said, “Policy did what was sensible—it responded in an extraordinary way.”
“When something goes off the edge,” Summers continued, “I think it’s a good idea to catch it.”
Audience members at the debate in Emerson Hall on Tuesday crowded the aisles and stairs, even spilling out into the hallway.
In response to the event, visiting student Nga Pingwong said she the two economists seemed to be talking past each other without providing suggestions for future policies.
“I think they aren’t really touching the point,” she said. “Both of them agree there is an influence, but they don’t go deep enough to say what would help.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you are like most people, you were probably pretty disappointed with the Oscars on Sunday night.
Save the unexpected showings by Cirque du Soleil and Angelina Jolie’s leg, depending on what you’re into, you probably were looking for something that had a little bit more pizazz.
Well I’m here to tell you that Billy Crystal is not the only one who can read minds.
We at The Crimson Sports know you all are dying to hear the winners of the Oscars, Harvard Athletics style—the Crimcademy Awards, if you will.
So before somebody cues the music to end my monologue, for your consideration…
Best Adapted Screenplay: Men’s Tennis
Their Twitter game just kills it. With their usually clever live-blogging of their tennis matches, these guys make me wish they played more often. Well done, sir.
Best Original Screenplay: Football
Undefeated Ivy League champions, most points scored in a single season in Harvard football history, decisive win against Yale in The Game—the Crimson football team’s story this year was all Hollywood. Individual players had storylines of their own, too. Two different quarterbacks broke the single-game touchdowns record in back-to-back games, and senior defensive lineman Josue Ortiz even proposed to his girlfriend after The Game, giving the team an added love story to go along with their utter domination on the field. Call it what you will, this football season was its very own Gladiator, action shots and all.
Best Documentary Feature: Women’s Squash
Last year, Harvard women’s squash had the best player in the nation. This year, it has the best two. By far. It’s like when the first two Lord of the Rings movies received so much attention in the Acadamy Awards, and then The Return of the King came along and just obliterated those numbers. Added to the fact that it just topped its perfect 17-0 season with a decisive 8-1 victory over No. 2 Yale to win the national title last weekend, women’s squash would have a great documentary story.
Best Makeup: Men’s Ice Hockey, Women’s Basketball, Women’s Volleyball, Softball, and Women’s Soccer
Though men’s hockey was the original favorite, this year there was a tie in the Best Makeup category. I’ll start with men’s hockey:
It’s not what you’re thinking. There’s no real makeup involved. The men’s hockey team did, however, sport something else on their faces that takes time to prepare in the morning: facial hair. During the month of November, the team let their mustaches and beards and Fu Manchus roam wild to partake in “No Shave November,” a movement that raises awareness about prostate cancer and men’s health in general. They even set up a donations page to raise money for the cause.
Sharing the award are the four women’s teams that participated in two charity events during the month of February, encouraging young girls to play sports and raising awareness and money for breast cancer. I’m pretty sure there were face tattoos present.
Best Supporting Actor(s):  Wrestling
On National Coming Out Day in October of last year, members of the Harvard wrestling team came out as allies to the LBGTQ community. Talk about taking your role to a whole new level. The Screen Actors Guild would be so proud.
Best Film Editing: ESPN3
I may just be bitter. But seriously. That replay from Saturday’s basketball game against Penn is fake. It can’t be real. It just can’t. Make the nightmares stop.
Best Original Musical Score: Men’s Basketball Fans
I know that none of the cheers the student section does are original. But frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn. The “whoop” Crimson fans bring in Lavietes is unlike anything else on campus and brings an extra edge of excitement to the games. I’ll take the “I Believe” chant over The Artist soundtrack any day of the week.
Best Actor: Patrick Witt, Yale football
Yes, he’s not a part of Harvard, but his acting is just too good. After convincing America he was still in the running for the Rhodes Scholarship right before The Game even though he allegedly wasn't, Witt could just as well be the next Jack Nicholson (wouldn’t that be something). So although you didn’t leave with the Rhodes Scholar or any dignity in Harvard’s crushing defeat over the Bulldogs in The Game, Patrick, here’s a made-up e-award with the name of your ex-alma mater’s rival attached to it, celebrating your accomplishments. Congratulations, you’ve finally won!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After an evenly-fought first half in which it trailed by as many as two goals, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team exploded for five unanswered goals in the third quarter, cruising to a 14-9 victory at Holy Cross on Tuesday evening.
Senior attackman Jeff Cohen scored five goals in the win, while sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp posted his second consecutive hat trick to add to three assists.
The No. 15 Crimson (2-0), which went into halftime clinging to a 7-6 lead, came out firing in the pivotal third frame. Co-captain Kevin Vaughan put Harvard ahead, 8-6, just over two minutes into the half on an assist from Eipp. Eipp earned another assist two minutes later as Cohen added to the Crimson’s lead.
Vaughan struck again with seven minutes to play in the quarter, and Cohen scored an unassisted goal three minutes afterwards to put Harvard ahead, 11-6.
In the last minute of the third frame, junior attackman Jack Walter capped off the dominant quarter with a man-down goal, one of his two, and the Crimson lead stretched to six.
The Crusaders’ (1-2) hope for a fourth-quarter comeback never materialized. After another goal from Eipp, junior midfielder Jack Curran broke Holy Cross’s scoring drought with nine minutes left to play in the game. But it was too little, too late. The Crusaders scored twice more in the waning minutes to pull within five goals, but the game was already out of reach.
“We had a little trouble adjusting to their offense early on,” Harvard coach Chris Wocjik said. “They were able to score a few goals on us in the first and second quarters. But I thought we adjusted, and our defense really stepped up in the third quarter, and we were able to pull away.”
Freshman attackman Keegan Michael opened the scoring 30 seconds into the game with his first career goal. Cohen followed suit just over a minute later, and the Crimson looked to be in control with a 2-0 lead.
Holy Cross responded minutes later, scoring two goals of its own within 90 seconds of each other. Walker answered quickly with a goal assisted by freshman midfielder Sean Mahon to put Harvard ahead, 3-2.
The back-and-forth play continued as the Crusaders added two more goals on consecutive possessions to grab their first lead. Eipp scored an unassisted goal at the end of the quarter to even the score.
The Crimson again fell behind at the start of the second quarter. Crusaders’ sophomore attackman John Daugherty scored an unassisted goal two minutes into the frame, and minutes later junior midfielder Myles Gillespie stretched the Harvard deficit to two with his second goal of the evening.
But it was all Crimson from there. The Crusaders’ attack was stifled by a Harvard defense that allowed four combined shots in the second and third quarters. Down 6-4 with just under 11 minutes to play in the first half, the Crimson began a scoring spree that spanned three periods and resulted in nine unanswered goals.
“I think our defense raised its level of play and limited any good looks for Holy Cross,” Wocjik said, “And that gave our offense a boost. They moved the ball really well and generated high-percentage shots.”
Cohen scored an unassisted goal with just over 10 minutes to play in the second frame to pull the Crimson within one, and Eipp tied the score at six soon after. Michael scored a man-up goal with just over a minute to play, and Harvard entered the half up by one.
What was a closely contested battle in the first half became a one-team show in the third quarter. Holy Cross was shut out in the period and only mustered two shots. After scoring five goals in the frame, Harvard added one more at the beginning of the final period, building a 13-6 lead that would prove insurmountable.
“We came out of halftime and guys started making plays.” Vaughan said. “When one person makes a play, everybody feeds off of that.”
The Crimson outshot its opponent, 46-26, for the game, while junior Harry Krieger made eight saves in goal.
Cohen surpassed 100 career goals with his five-goal performance; his 101 goals are 6th-best all time for Harvard. He also has a team-best seven goals on the season and is currently tied for 7th in the nation with 3.5 goals per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team lost to Princeton, 70-62, on Feb. 11—the same day that pop-icon Whitney Houston passed away at the too-young age of 48. I, perhaps unwisely, tried to convince my girlfriend and her roommate that I was justified in being more crushed by the Crimson loss than the death of an icon. I made progressively more damning arguments: “She was before my time…I’m not that into R&B, I am into basketball…I never met her, but I have met the guys on the team.” I eventually settled on the following analogy: “This is equivalent to some objectively more successful artist—say, The Beatles—killing Whitney right when she was at her peak. Twice.”
I’ve blocked what happened next from my memory, but suffice it to say I was lucky that Valentine’s Day was just a few short days away and, with a nice bouquet of flowers and the traditional Hallmark festivities, all was forgotten.
But the pain still lingered.
Which is why Friday’s victory over the Tigers was so sweet. Princeton has been coach Tommy Amaker and co.’s nemesis these past couple years, and once again it put up a solid fight at Lavietes before Harvard exorcised some demons, winning 67-64, as the crowd chanted those sweet six words, “I believe that we will win.”
I walked back to the quad with my friends regaling one of the best played basketball games we’d seen in a while. I called my girlfriend and told her she was right about Whitney. There wasn’t going to be a playoff like last year. The boys wanted it too much. This was our year.
Then Zack Rosen happened.
What is there to say about Penn’s senior point guard who put up 14 points in the second half to bring the Quakers back from a nine-point deficit with eight minutes left to beat the Crimson, 55-54, in the dying seconds of the game? To borrow from my idol, Ron Burgundy, “I’m not even mad. That’s amazing.”  Though Mr. Burgundy was referring to his dog Baxter’s ability to poop in the refrigerator and eat a whole wheel of cheese, the late-game collapse left me similarly dumbfounded. There was nothing to do but “get in [my] p.j.’s and hit the hay.”
I’m not going to say Harvard deserved to win the game—it didn’t. Nor am I going to say that the charging call on junior Kyle Casey with 5.7 seconds left was wrong—it wasn’t. But I will say that there are about a hundred reasons why the Crimson should have won. If even an ounce of effort had been given to defend Penn’s Miles Cartwright at the end of the first half…if just one of co-captain Oliver McNally’s threes rattled in…if Harvard had its average number of turnovers, 12, instead of 20…. The list goes on. But if ifs and buts were candy and nuts we’d all have a merry Christmas.
Amaker and his team will just have to file away Saturday’s loss into a growing glossary of devastation. After all, a Crimson sweep of Columbia and Cornell this weekend will mean—at the very least—a share of the Ivy title and yet another end-of-season playoff with one of the killer P’s.
The fact that this column is being written is remarkable for a number of reasons. First, who would have thought Harvard’s basketball fans would not only be crushed but genuinely shocked that the Crimson was entering the final weekend of the season with two conference losses. Before last year, that had never happened.
But this year’s squad isn’t any typical Harvard team. Everyone returned from the best team in program history. It won the pre-season Battle for Atlantis tournament and competed on the road against defending national champion UConn. The Crimson even occupied a spot in the Top-25 for much of the campaign. This was supposed to be the year; on paper, one of the best Ivy League teams in conference history. There was even talk of making a Cornell-like run in the NCAA tournament—which Harvard hasn’t been to since 1946. But now, at the hands of an undersized point guard from New Jersey, there’s a chance the Crimson won’t even be dancing in March, let alone making a run to the Sweet Sixteen.
My parents always told me not to count my eggs until they’d hatched. But in my mind, and the minds of so many Harvard faithful, this egg was hatched, walking around about to make a delicious dinner.
This past weekend’s results are a testament to why they don’t play the games on paper. But Tommy, if you can somehow pull this off and get the Crimson into the tournament, then, to borrow from the late, great Whitney Houston, “I will always love you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the C.R.A.S.H.-B. honor row, there’s nowhere to hide. And that’s how Mike DiSanto likes it.
The Harvard heavyweight captain finished first among collegiate competitors and second overall in the openweight division at the world’s largest indoor rowing regatta.
“It can be really challenging to row a great piece at C.R.A.S.H.-B.s: partly the adrenaline, partly the air’s very dry,” said Chris Richards, DiSanto’s high school coach. “From my perspective, Michael rowed just about a perfect piece.... He really was just spot on.”
It was just the latest of DiSanto’s big stage successes, which include two Eastern Sprints titles, two silver medals at the IRA National Championship, first place in the Ladies’ Challenge Plate at Henley Royal Regatta, a grand final appearance at the U23 World Championships, and a national championship in high school.
DiSanto attributes his racing success to his experience from wrestling at Belmont Hill.
“We worked really hard in wrestling and a lot of the stuff you learned in wrestling you could apply to rowing, not so much physical aspects, but more mental: pushing yourself through the pain and putting in the extra hours once practice was over,” he said. “In wrestling it’s you and another guy out on the mat, so you don’t want to get embarrassed. There’s no one else to blame it on in wrestling, so you really have to make sure you’re pushing yourself every time you step in there.”
It was DiSanto’s toughness in wrestling that initially caught Richards’ eye.
“The wrestling coach came to me and said, ‘You’ve got to come down and watch this kid,’” Richards recalled. “I was very impressed. He’s very tough, very determined, very competitive. I thought, ‘Gosh, this guy could make a pretty good rower.’ After one of his matches, I said, ‘Mike, can I speak to you? I’d love you to come row.’”
But DiSanto was a baseball player who had already put down his deposit for the baseball team’s Florida training trip.
“I thought, ‘I’m not going to give up on this one,’” Richards said. “I spoke to his parents—his parents were loyal fans, would come to the wrestling matches—and said, ‘I really think Mike could be a good oarsman.’ They got intrigued by the idea.... At the 11th hour, he decided he would come down and row and forego the baseball.”
DiSanto progressed quickly. After racing all spring in the third boat, he managed to earn a spot in Belmont Hill’s Henley-bound eight, which was when he decided to stick with rowing.
The following year he won a national championship, and he graduated a year later with erg records at every distance.
“Mike is a great story,” Richards said. “He came to Belmont Hill and was a soccer player, a downhill skier, and a baseball player. He graduated as captain of football, captain of wrestling, and captain of crew. You don’t see that every day to be sure.”
DiSanto has continued to thrive on the Charles River, making the IRA silver-medal-winning first freshman eight in his rookie campaign and the first varsity eight in the following two seasons.
But for all of his successes, DiSanto and the rest of the senior class won’t let themselves forget the race they fell short: the Grand Final at the 2009 Eastern Sprints.
“We had that tough Sprints race freshman year where we finished second to Brown, and I think that’s kind of been the motivating force for how successful we’ve been since then,” he said. “I don’t know what would have happened if we hadn’t lost that race.”
But junior David Fuller, DiSanto’s high school teammate in rowing and wrestling, said motivation has never been an issue for Harvard’s captain.
“In wrestling we always ran stairs,” Fuller reminisced. “If he ever got passed, [he’d] go berserk and end up beating the guy who passed him. That competitiveness and work ethic is really what I noticed in him.”
The rest of his teammates took notice too, electing him captain.
“I think he’s been a great captain,” Crimson coach Harry Parker said. “He’s been very attentive to what the squad is doing. He sets a great example in his own training. He has a great work ethic, and he’s been just a very thoughtful captain.”
“It really helps when the captain’s logging in the extra miles,” Fuller said.
Those extra miles have helped DiSanto earn a spot at the prestigious California Rowing Club, where he will train with the hopes of making the national team.
The trip across the country will be quite the change for DiSanto, but it’s unlikely the California weather will make the proud Bostonian forget his origins.
“That was a big part of choosing Harvard...staying local,” he said. “Being able to stay close to my parents and family, staying close to my high school—I’m pretty invested in it.”
And Richards won’t forget the accomplishments of DiSanto and the Crimson’s other Belmont Hill graduates: “Basically, they have made me unbelievably proud.”
