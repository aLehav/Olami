After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To our readers:
In recent months, the murders of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony McDade, Rayshard Brooks, and countless other Black Americans have focused the country’s eyes on America’s longstanding history of police violence and systemic racism. At The Harvard Crimson, we condemn racism and reaffirm that Black lives matter. Our position as journalists in this historic moment demands that we fulfill our mission to report ethically and hold power accountable more than ever.

As journalists, we have the obligation to tell important stories and expose inequalities within our community. At this moment, however, we recognize the complicated relationship that historically marginalized groups have with the media; The Crimson is very much part of this complicated relationship.

The Crimson has historically been led by and made up predominantly of white staff members. As a newspaper, we have failed in our mission to represent the diversity of our student body in our staff and have not been supportive enough to Black, Latinx, and other students of color at Harvard College. Throughout The Crimson’s history, our coverage has often failed communities of color at Harvard, and there are many stories we have missed. We cannot cover a campus as diverse as Harvard without a newsroom that reflects our student body, and diversity on our staff must be the priority going forward.

This week, I along with our Managing Editor, Business Manager, and Diversity and Inclusivity Chairs, shared with The Crimson’s staff our plans toward that goal. Among them are plans to bolster our internal Diversity and Inclusivity Committee; establish a mentorship program with our alumni of color; subsidize student memberships to journalism affinity organizations; and add resources to our website explaining The Crimson’s reporting practices, mission statement, and diversity and inclusion initiatives. These steps are by no means exhaustive nor the end of our work on improving diversity and inclusion at The Crimson. We must be proactive, not reactive, in making sure the building and our work reflect the diversity of the Harvard community.

Past Crimson leaders, especially Crimson editors of color, have worked over the decades to build a more equitable publication for both for its readers and editors. We have long been slow to change and acknowledge that the burden of effecting change should not fall only on Black, Latinx, and other editors of color. The Crimson as an institution is committed to supporting them.

As a newspaper, we have a critically important role to play in serving as an outlet for truth that reflects the diverse voices of those on Harvard’s campus. We are committed to this mission, and we urge our readers to hold us accountable to it.

Sincerely,
Aidan F. Ryan ’21
President of the 147th Guard

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School student Abraham Barkhordar filed a class action lawsuit Monday against Harvard asking for partial reimbursement of tuition for the online spring semester.
Barkhordar — a rising second-year student — filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts alleging the school provided a “subpar” educational experience following its transition to remote instruction in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The complaint demands the University proportionally refund tuition to all class members for the spring and for any future online academic terms — damages, the suit argues, that exceed $5 million.
The lawsuit claims the lack of in-person access to resources and a collaborative learning environment during the remote semester failed to meet the quality of education students were promised in exchange for their tuition and fees.
“While students enrolled and paid Defendant for a comprehensive academic experience, Defendant instead offered Plaintiff and the Class Members something far less: a limited online experience presented by Zoom, void of face-to-face faculty and peer interaction, separated from program resources, and barred from facilities vital to study,” it reads.
In an interview with The Crimson, Barkhordar attributed his decision to attend the Law School to his ability to interact with professors and students across campus and in class.
“A lot of law school revolves around a lively in-class debate — whether it's a heated argument or funny banter,” he said. “It’s just not the same over Zoom.”
The complaint also argues Barkhordar experienced a decrease in academic rigor and standards. The Law School shifted to a mandatory credit-fail grading system shortly after the transition to online learning.
“Such decreased assignments and reduced expectations in turn have reduced and negated the educational experience for which Plaintiff paid Defendant,” the complaint reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain and Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Warren T. Burns, one of the lawyers representing Barkhordar, said in an interview that the University approached the move to remote instruction with “pretty deaf ears” by not discounting tuition after the lives of students were disrupted.
“By continuing distance learning and refusing to refund or rebate tuition and fees, the University is, in essence, unjustly enriched as a result,” Burns said.
The lawsuit follows a June 3 announcement that the Law School, among other graduate schools at the University, will hold its fall semester online.
The school subsequently faced backlash after hosting a series of informational webinars about the decision in which administrators made comments about the fall semester which students alleged were insulting. The controversial statements during the webinars included a suggestion for students to use grants and loans to rent an office space if they need a quiet place to study remotely.
Law School spokesperson Jeff Neal wrote in a statement at the time that students needed to determine what option was best for them.
“Ultimately, we indicated that every student must determine which options make the most sense for them, depending on their particular circumstances,” Neal wrote at the time.
Barkhordar said his decision to take legal action against the University stemmed from these comments and the administration’s handling of worries about the fall semester.
“The administration's response to students’ valid concerns has been really disrespectful,” he said. “To say the least, I wanted to take a stand against it and represent my classmates who are some of the most amazing, motivated people I've met in my life.”
The Law School administration did address tuition concerns on its website, noting that it already canceled its expected tuition increase, but that cutting tuition is a University-level decision.
Barkhordar’s complaint marks the second multi-million dollar lawsuit filed against Harvard for its online educational experience during the pandemic. Several other Ivy League schools, including Brown, Columbia, and Cornell, face similar class action lawsuits for tuition reimbursements.
LeElle B. Slifer, a Law School graduate and another attorney for Barkhordar, said she understands the difficult decisions and financial situation Harvard faces due to the pandemic but ultimately agrees that students should not pay for on-campus benefits they are not receiving.
“Harvard is being incredibly tone-deaf right now, and it's basically trying to profit off of these 18 and 20-something-year-olds, and that's just not fair,” she said. “We're just trying to get what's fair for the students who are taking out loans in their name.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College has suspended all study abroad for the fall 2020 semester, director of International Education Camila Nardozzi wrote in an email to program applicants Wednesday.
The suspension applies to all in-person international programs, including the fall terms of year-long academic programs.
Nardozzi wrote that the College made the “difficult” decision in response to factors such as student safety, fluctuating travel restrictions, and disruptions in visa processing.
She added that administrators also wanted to be conscientious about the potential impact of incoming Harvard students on local healthcare systems in the case of a coronavirus resurgence.
Melody M. Wang ’22, who planned to study abroad in Denmark this fall, said she was “disappointed” but not surprised at the announcement.
“I was holding on to a little bit of hope that Harvard would allow programs to determine independently if they were going to run or not, instead of Harvard just banning students from participating in any type of study abroad,” she said.
Wang said while her program itself has yet to announce its plans for the fall, she said she expected that it would continue as planned since the severity of the pandemic has waned in Denmark and the country has begun easing lockdown restrictions.
Ezra B. Feder ’23 said he also applied to a program in Denmark, as well as to a program hosted by Hebrew University in Israel.
“I'm concerned about this upcoming semester at Harvard because I'm not excited for the online classes. And so I thought that I would apply to study abroad in the hopes of finding a program where classes were in-person,” he said.
The College informed students in a town hall earlier this month that fall courses would be largely — if not entirely — virtual, regardless of whether students return to live on campus.
Since rates of coronavirus infections in both Denmark and Israel are lower than in the U.S., Feder said he hoped studying in either location would afford him “a more normal college experience.”
“In many instances, it's probably less safe to be in the U.S. than it is to be in these other countries,” he added.
Feder said the College’s decision to suspend international programming might spur him to take a leave of absence, though his plans are contingent on whether undergraduates will be allowed to return to campus in the fall.
After her study abroad plans fell through, Wang also said she would consider a leave of absence next semester.
University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote in an email May 11 that Harvard has prohibited all University-related international travel until further notice. The policy applies to all Harvard affiliates, including students, faculty, and staff. The University also strongly discouraged personal international travel.
Nardozzi wrote in her email that while Harvard would not permit any undergraduate to study abroad for the fall, the Office of International Education is “fully committed” to assist students in considering study abroad options in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After more than three months since the initial outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Cambridge, many local businesses have struggled to stay open, with a few even closing their doors permanently.
In Harvard Square, 62-year-old family-owned eatery Café Pamplona announced it would close its doors, citing a steep drop in customers in the spring. Even chain businesses, like Wellbridge Athletic Club near Harvard Kennedy School and Legal Sea Foods in Charles Square have decided to let their leases expire in recent weeks.
Theodora M. “Theo” Skeadas ’12 who directs the Cambridge Local First network of Cambridge businesses, said that of the roughly 200 businesses she is in contact with, 50 to 100 are on the verge of closing. She wrote that she is aware of at least 10 local restaurants outside Harvard Square that have already shuttered.
“They’re very sad and stressed and anxious,” Skeadas said of business owners. “The word desperation comes up a lot.”
Former owner of Café Pamplona Nina S. Hovagimian said she and her husband were living “paycheck to paycheck.” After her second month behind on her mortgage and serving very few customers per day, she closed her shop in mid May. Hovagimian said she was filing for bankruptcy.
“The café was me. I did everything,” she said. “It’s just like a part of me, like having a baby. It’s a big loss because I put everything I had into it.”
Pamplona — like many other Harvard Square businesses — relies on student patronage, which has been absent since Harvard students were sent home in mid-March.
“I don’t know how you survive without the students. Harvard Square is Harvard,” she said.
Hovagimian said operating under social distancing restrictions would have been difficult for the café, which occupies a small section of a basement.
Café Pamplona has previously been grandfathered by the city, according to Hovagimian. She said she doesn’t know how a new business in its place might bring the location up to code. Regardless, Hovagimian said she is hopeful the shop can remain under a new owner.
In Charles Square, Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant chain founded in Cambridge in 1950, will also shut its doors — at least temporarily. Vice President of Marketing Ida Faber wrote in an emailed statement the restaurant had tried to find a “more prominent” location since its original 15-year lease ended in 2018 but was unable to do so.
She noted that with the lease expiring at the end of June and the continued effects of the pandemic, it did not make sense to reopen for a “short window of time.”
“Given the fluidity of the extended stay-at-home orders and subsequent reopening restrictions as well as other factors like the cancellation of Harvard’s commencement, we felt it didn’t make sense to re-open for such a short window of time,” Faber wrote.

Another chain, Wellbridge Athletic Club, announced it would also close its Cambridge location after 20 years. The club — which operated across from the Kennedy School — wrote on its website it would not reopen because rent negotiations fell through.

“While Wellbridge management was hopeful for a positive outcome of our recent lease negotiations we were unable to achieve an agreement to move forward in re-opening the club,” the website read. “Not only is this a sad change for Wellbridge, it comes at an even more challenging time for the world.
Dickson Bros. — a fixture in Harvard Square for almost 80 years — will also close. Owner Ned Ver Planck said he plans to retire from the hardware store.
For businesses that are still in operation, owners are working overtime to weather the effects of COVID-19 and stay somewhat profitable.
At Grendel’s Den in Harvard Square, owner Kari Kuelzer said she has not had a day off since late March. Kuelzer explained that for small, family-run restaurants, owners personally shoulder the burdens of the business to “come out of the ashes” of the pandemic.
“A lot of that depends on whether or not you have an energetic person who's willing to put all the blood, sweat, and tears into rebuilding a business after such a devastating blow,” she said. “I can testify to it because I have not had a day off and when I say a day, I mean I work 15 to 20 hours a day.”
Despite the long hours, Kuelzer said she has been able to navigate the challenges of COVID-19 because she has an “emotional connection” to her business.
“I have an incredibly wonderful, close-knit community of staff who are like family members to me,” she said. “Our business is not just about food, and drinks and calories and alcohol. Our business is about people and about society.”
“And so we have that — society thrives inside of our walls,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 81 percent of the admitted students to the College Class of 2024 will attend Harvard next year, the College announced Friday morning.
When Harvard’s reply deadline passed on May 1, the yield figure stood at 84 percent — the College’s highest since the 1970s. It decreased three percentage points since then as students deferred enrollment due to uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic.
The new 81 percent number marks a slight dip from the 82 percent of Class of 2023 admits who enrolled in the College this past fall. As admits elect to take gap years, the College has already pulled students off its waiting list and will make all final decisions by the end of July.
Over half of entering freshmen applied for financial aid. Roughly 22 percent will have their education covered by the College’s Financial Aid Initiative — a slight increase from 20 percent of Class of 2023 students who qualified for the initiative’s low-income portion.
Women make up over half of the incoming class: 51.8 percent, compared to 48.2 percent men. Asian Americans represent 24.6 percent of the incoming class, a slight decrease from a record-high 25.6 percent for the Class of 2023. African Americans comprise 13.9 percent of the class, an increase from 13.1 last year, and the proportion of Latinx students remained level at 11.8 percent. Native Americans and Native Hawaiians make up 2 percent of the class, down slightly from 2.2 percent last year.
Prospective social science concentrators make up over a quarter of the incoming student body at 27 percent, with 19.9 percent interested in concentrating in the biological sciences, 15.1 percent in the humanities, 9.5 percent in engineering, 7.4 percent in physical sciences, 7 percent in math, and 6.8 percent in computer science. Just over seven percent of the Class of 2024 remains undecided about their potential field of study.
Still, those statistics may change during the three semesters entering students have to select a concentration. A recent College report surveying data from the incoming classes of 2015 through 2021 found that “58% of students who report that they intend to concentrate in a Humanities discipline in the application to Harvard actually end up declaring a concentration in a non-Humanities discipline.”
International students make up 11.5 percent of the incoming class, a decrease from 13.1 percent of current freshmen.
First-generation students are 18.7 percent of the class, jumping from 14.5 percent for the Class of 2023. The number of students with prior military experience or who look to participate in ROTC at Harvard also grew. Twelve veterans and 34 students interested in ROTC will join the entering class, an increase from six and 28 from the Class of 2023, respectively.
“The Class of 2024 is comprised of so many of the nation’s and world’s promising students,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in the release. “We are delighted that they have chosen Harvard for their undergraduate experiences, and we look forward to seeing all they accomplish in their years here.”
