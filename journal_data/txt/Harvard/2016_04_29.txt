After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As President Obama stepped off Air Force One to begin his historic visit to Havana, he seized the opportunity to fire off a tweet: “¿Que Bola Cuba?” His message, which in Cuban-Spanish slang roughly translates to “What’s popping?” or “What’s good?” was surely intended to ingratiate and serve as an opening olive branch to his hosts.  The irony—that the majority of Cubans would never see his message thanks to repressive internet censorship—was entirely lost on the president.
This dissonance summarizes the mood of the two-day spectacle. President Obama, the first sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge, intended to lay the foundations for renewed cooperation between the two countries. The challenge for the President was to balance the diplomatic goal of demonstrating a workable political relationship with Raul Castro, while paying lip service to the issue of the dictator’s human rights abuses.
Predictably, the results proved awkward. During a joint press conference with President Obama, Raul Castro scolded reporters for asking about human rights violations and lambasted U.S. economic policy. Soon after the conclusion of the visit, an official organ of the state-controlled Cuban media used racially vulgar language to insult the President of the United States. The no-strings-attached commitment from President Obama to lift the embargo emboldened Castro to criticize the U.S. and redeploy his communist message.
Even more embarrassing, as our President posed for photos in front of a Che Guevara mural and tweeted about his trip, thousands of political prisoners—including members of the Ladies in White movement—detained for no reason other than their peaceful opposition to political repression, rotted in jails across the island.
The current Cuban regime has made brutality towards political dissidents a regular part of its operation. Raul Castro denies the presence of political prisoners, yet the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation reports 2,555 detentions in the first two months of this year, after more than 8,600 in 2015. Members of opposition political parties are regularly subject to machete attacks, and refugees stopped by Cuban coastguard risk extrajudicial killing. Despite all this, U.S. leadership seems to have fallen for Castro’s propaganda.
President Obama says he wants to “bury the last remnant” of the Cold War. But his visit will have the opposite effect. It ensures prolonged communist rule in Cuba by extending an economic lifeline and legitimacy to the Castro regime. Seduced by the chance at being the leader who would liberate the Cuban people from the “failed” U.S. embargo, President Obama chose to cement his place in history rather than to stand with those who risk their lives to fight for basic freedoms.
The symbolic power that the United States holds to those standing up to totalitarianism is not easy for those of us born here to understand. But for pro-democratic freedom fighters—whether across the communist bloc in the 1980s, or today in Cuba—American solidarity has been a source of strength. There is no other nation so steadfast in its defense of freedom of expression, basic human rights, and democracy. Like the authors of this piece, one of the left and one of the right, Americans across the political spectrum ought to support these principles. The symbolic power of the U.S. in standing for human rights has eroded in this abandonment of Cuban pro-democratic dissidents.
The pain was real for Cuban-Americans who watched as the leader of the free world befriended the dictator they risked their lives to flee. One such Cuban, Natividad Silva, an 85-year-old retired pharmacist and the grandmother of one of the authors of this piece, fled Cuba in 1962 when the Castros confiscated her small business and life savings. She began fearing for her life as peaceful dissidents around her in Havana were incarcerated, tortured, and killed. Her story is by no means unique. It is shared by the millions of Cuban immigrants in the U.S. and the hundreds of refugees who continue to flee the Castro regime each month.
President Obama turned a blind eye to human rights violations and made the political calculation that his reversal of American policy towards Cuba would represent another jewel in his foreign policy legacy. In doing so, he abolished America’s unique role as a beacon of freedom to the pro-democratic Cuban opposition and to dissidents in totalitarian states around the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“I came to Harvard for the people.”
I think the past four years of this column has mostly been a reaction to this goddamn sentence.
As one especially prudent Harvard scholar mocked, it seems like every year, the welcoming speech at VISITAS features a portion like “Among your class of 2,024 students, there are 2,400 valedictorians, 50 debate champions, 12 former clowns, five of the original cast of High School Musical 2, Batman (which one of you he is, we still don’t know), and a rubber ducky with a surprisingly high GPA.” And then every pre-frosh hears the same sentiment from students and administrators alike: If there’s any reason to come to Harvard, it’s “for the people.” This idea carries weight throughout our four years here, and it seems to be widely-accepted among a plurality of students I’ve met.
I think this sentiment is one of the most destructive parts of our Harvard experience.
Don’t get me wrong: I love “The People.” This whole column has mainly been written for the viewing pleasure of the amazingly talented, passionate, and driven “People” in my class year—the Class of 2016. Apologies to the Classes of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 for not making the cut. No apologies to the Class of 2019, because I don’t apologize to freshmen.
But there’s this strange reverence with which many say “I came for The People.” It’s as if The People of each Harvard class are a miraculous set of students who, having already tremendously changed the world through their high school accomplishments, are suddenly thrust into a place where they can take classes and prepare to solve the world’s problems with some of the best minds in the world.
Most people uncritically accept that notion. But, in my view, it’s not entirely true. And much of my writing has been about how and why that mentality can hurt us all.
I think that for almost every student, there is a measure of arbitrary luck that stains her/his admissions profile and acceptance, preferencing them above others who may have “deserved” their spot just as much. I think that glorifying ourselves distorts that perspective. And by glorifying, we lose sight of broader social inequalities that got us here. We feel compelled to pad our resumes with extracurriculars to reinforce the idea of our “specialness,” even if our classes are the most valuable thing Harvard has to offer. We spend our time trying to be productive with our peers, rather than taking the time to just enjoy their presence and perspectives. Rather than a cohesive community that shares deep, common experiences and supports one another, our class becomes more of a museum-like collection of supposedly impressive people who circle and buzz around one another in the activities we do. We feel guilty to be here, rather than grateful, since we feel like we are less-impressive versions of all the impressive people that seem to surround us. And we feel inadequate if we’re not part of social groups that let us fraternize and network with the best The People have to offer.
Eventually, as we all settle into our friend groups in the Houses, I think many of us begin to see through the glorifying facade. Some of our peers have awe-inspiring stories of getting here. Many do not. Some have done impressive enough things at Harvard to get a Business Insider article written about them. Most have not.
We come to realize that The People here, at the end of the day, really are just people—they laugh at dumb things, they enjoy Netflix n’ Chilling, and they have little clue about what exactly they’ll end up doing with the rest of their lives. I’ve found my peers here to be generally smart and impressive. But, like me, their insights and accomplishments are not constantly breathtaking. And that makes all the difference: When you realize this, Harvard stops being a money/prestige/social climbing mosh-pit of talent, and it becomes a place where hard work can exist alongside friendship and life as usual.
So, Class of 2016, this is what I want to finally say to you. And it’s probably antithetical to what you’ll hear in the coming weeks: You haven’t impressed me as much as I thought you would. Most of your hard work so far hasn’t had a broad impact outside of these gates. And, much like the many graduating classes before you, you won’t even come close to saving the world from each of its many issues after graduation.
But, and this is a big but…thank you for your friendship. Thank you for your support. And thank you for making Harvard a home. As with any friendship, you gave love, encouragement, and compassion. You showed your humanity. That was all I could ask for. That was more than enough. And it’s been a tremendous pleasure to write for you.
So, I begin the first of many cheers to you in the weeks before graduation. Here’s to you. Here’s to 2016. And, most importantly, here’s to its people—its real, not-so-special, flawed, but nonetheless awesome people.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, students from the Extension School gathered in front of University Hall to rally for  a change in the names of its degrees. Led by a student group calling itself the Harvard Extension Degree Change Initiative, the protesters called for more specificity in the name of degrees awarded by the Extension School. Current degree candidates at the Extension School—only a small fraction of the school’s students—earn a Bachelor or Master of Liberal Arts degree in “Extension Studies” rather than in the subject which they studied.
The group leading the movement to remove “Extension Studies” from the degree has collected more than 1,500 signatures in support of its cause. Dean of Continuing Education Huntington D. Lambert is supportive of changing how students’ degrees describe their courses of study. We agree that Harvard should consider making the change to clarify the role of a degree from the Extension School.
This kind of change would not be unprecedented. In 2009, a different change to the names of Extension School degrees was proposed by the Faculty of Arts Sciences’ Committee on Continuing Education as part of a broader rethinking of the Extension School’s modern role. While the concerns voiced then by some members of the faculty persist, we believe that Harvard can strike a balance between better recognizing the studies of Extension School students and clearly differentiating the degrees awarded by other Harvard schools.
In describing the Extension School’s degrees more accurately, the language chosen must differentiate Extension School diplomas in such a way that employers and future students alike are not confused between the two. The difference between the rigor and selectivity of the two programs cannot be denied.
But the Extension School students’ contention is not that the language is too specific. Rather, it is that the language is not specific enough. After all, “Extension Studies” is neither an academic program nor an accurate description of what students actually study. When the name of a degree does not state the subject in which a student has specialized, it diminishes the academic work that the student successfully completed while at Harvard. This is not right.
For this reason, we urge Harvard to consider changing the title of Extension School degrees to include the field of study rather than the ambiguous “Extension Studies.” Even with this change, students at the College and the Extension School would earn degrees that reflect the differences between the two programs.
The only question at stake is one of fairness to Extension School students; whether or not the language changes, a degree from Harvard College will have the same power it has always had.

Members of the Undergraduate Council’s Finance Committee will push to change the rule prohibiting the body from funding events during reading period, after the regulation generated controversy and caused multiple financial errors in recent weeks.
According to an agreement between the Office of Student Life and the UC, the Finance Committee is not permitted to distribute funds collected from the $75 Student Activities Fee to events that take place “during shopping period, reading period, and finals.” The rule is meant to address the concern that “given unlimited time, people will throw a lot of events and not do work,” UC Finance Committee Chair William A. Greenlaw ’17 said. 
UC representatives are now questioning the rule in response to a current Finance Committee inquiry to determine whether the Bach Society Orchestra, which requested funding for a concert during reading period but did not list the concert date on their grant application, “willfully violated standing grant policy.”
The Finance Committee postponed the inquiry, which was set to take place Wednesday, after failing to reach a quorum at the meeting.
Earlier this month, the Council revoked funding from four clubs that had initially been allocated money for events scheduled during reading period.
During Wednesday’s Finance Committee meeting, committee members discovered three additional events—all Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club productions—which had mistakenly received a cumulative total of $2,883 for events during Arts First. The festival, which takes place during reading period, celebrates “student and faculty creativity” and is organized by the Office for the Arts.
“Those could all be classified as our mistake,” UC Rules Committee Chair Daniel R. Levine ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, said.
In a fourth case, the committee also erroneously provided $320 in funding to the Harvard Ballet Company for a ballet performance during Arts First, despite the committee's knowledge that the event was scheduled during reading period.
“We had a miscommunication with the treasurer, and accidentally funded them,” Greenlaw wrote in a message. 
Several representatives pointed out that student groups in the arts are in a difficult position, given that while the Office for the Arts encourages events to take place during the Arts First festival over reading period, the Office of Student Life funding rules discourage events during that period.
“There's a contradiction that student groups in the arts have to deal with,” Levine said.
Greenlaw proposed that the committee negotiate with the Office of Student Life for a revision of the reading period rule to allow events to receive funding through the first weekend of reading period.
“I don’t like defunding people for reading period,” Greenlaw said. “There’s little disadvantage to [the proposal], because it’s just the weekend.”
“I think it’s to the benefit of the student body if we successfully negotiate an extension for the weekend of reading period,” Greenlaw added.
In an email, Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich recognized that several end-of-year events take place during reading period, and wrote that “the College’s policy... reserves the ability to restrict events during reading period that may adversely affect students’ ability to study and prepare for exams.”
Pforzheimer House Representative Neel Mehta ’18 said he felt the proposal would be a “reasonable compromise.”
In an interview earlier this month, UC Treasurer Samarth Gupta ’18 said he would be open to considering a change in the reading period rule, though he acknowledged the policy’s value in avoiding “many extracurriculars going on during reading period and finals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students and faculty at Occidental College are protesting the school’s choice of Harvard Law School professor Randall L. Kennedy as their commencement speaker for his controversial statements on race-related activism and the film “The Hunting Ground.”
Students aligned with race-related activism groups and sexual assault prevention groups at the Los Angeles college have publicly criticized the choice—announced April 14— and some have called on the school to revoke Kennedy’s invitation.
Their complaints center around a November op-ed signed by Kennedy and 18 other HLS professors that challenges “The Hunting Ground,” a film they say erroneously portrays a sexual assault case at the Law School. Opponents of the choice of Kennedy as speaker also took issue with the professor’s criticism of race-related activism at the Law School.
“Students and faculty at Oxy have been struggling intensely with the administration over sexual assault and racial justice issues in the past three years, so I was surprised that the president selected a speaker who has both publicly gone after a student sexual assault survivor and attributing racial justice activism to an ‘inflated sense of victimization’ on campus,” Occidental professor Caroline Heldman—who appears in “The Hunting Ground”—wrote in an emailed statement.
The vocal opposition prompted Occidental College President Jonathan Veitch to respond in a message to school affiliates defending his choice and emphasizing the importance of listening to a range of viewpoints.
“Randall Kennedy was chosen because he is a thoughtful and nuanced commentator on race in America,” Veitch wrote. “While I understand the critiques raised around the issues of race and sexual assault that have been the subject of so much pain on our campus, it is equally important that we remain receptive to a free and open dialogue that includes a wide variety of perspectives.”
Race-related activism has overtaken Occidental’s campus this academic year, as student groups have demanded better treatment of minorities at the school and called for Veitch’s removal. The movement is one of many taking place at universities across the country, and several Occidental students joined the student activist group Reclaim Harvard Law’s occupation at the Law School in February.
“Your choice of speakers… speak not to your espousal of liberal values of ‘free speech’ and ‘tolerance’ but of your burning desire to obliterate dissent,” students affiliated with the group Coalition at Oxy for Diversity and Equity wrote in an open letter to Veitch.
Kennedy said in an interview that he is not surprised some Occidental affiliates disagree with his views, as race and sexual assault are controversial subjects. Diverging opinions, however, should not bar institutions from inviting speakers, he said.
“Universities, above all places in American life, should be places where debate and free exchange are facilitated and expected,” Kennedy said. “The idea that because a group of people disagrees with somebody, that in it of itself simply cannot or should not be the basis for excluding someone.”
Abhilasha Bhola, a member of the Coalition at Oxy for Diversity and Equity, said she does not take issue with controversial speakers in general. Rather, she criticized the fact that Veitch had complete discretion over the selection of the commencement speaker and chose one who she said “stands against our shared values” and does not represent the senior class well.
Not all students share Bhola’s sentiment. Occidental student Aaron Gottesman estimated that around 15 to 20 percent of the student body is aligned with activism movements on campus, and said he is not among them. Gottesman was pleased with the choice of Kennedy, and said he thinks the backlash is indicative of larger issues on college campuses nationwide relating to safe spaces and free speech.
“There’s a tendency of students at Oxy to transplant national problems—what you’re seeing at Yale and Missouri—to Occidental’s campus,” he said, referring to race-related protests that occurred last fall.“The issues that are being raised are that what he said in his op-eds and books are violent. That speaks to the totalitarian belief that speech is violent, so we need to limit speech.”
After faculty and staff began voicing concerns, Kennedy changed his travel plans to arrive at Occidental a day early in order to meet and talk with students and faculty ahead of his commencement address.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A wave of student protest failed to persuade Yale University to remove the name of former U.S. Vice President and slavery advocate John C. Calhoun from a residential college named after him.
Yale University President Peter Salovey announced Wednesday that the Calhoun name would remain, and said he made his decision in favor of remembering and confronting the history of slavery at the school. He also announced the title of the faculty members who preside over Yale’s residential colleges would be changed from “master” to “head of college.”
Student protests against racism and for better treatment of minorities reached a peak on Yale’s campus last semester after Erika Christakis, a lecturer and co-master of a residential college at the time, criticized Yale as overbearing for cautioning students not to wear culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. Meanwhile, Yale’s Calhoun College became the focus of national attention because of its namesake’s association with slavery and white supremacy as students demanded a new name.
“Removing Calhoun’s name obscures the legacy of slavery rather than addressing it,” Salovey wrote in an email announcement. “Erasing Calhoun’s name from a much-beloved residential college risks masking this past.”
Along with the replacement title for “masters” and the Calhoun decision, Salovey announced Yale’s highest governing body had decided on names for the university’s two new residential colleges.
One college will be named after Anna Pauline “Pauli” Murray, a former civil rights activist and the first African American to receive a Doctor of Juridical Science degree from Yale Law School—marking the first time a college at Yale will be named for a woman or African American. The other residential college will be named after Benjamin Franklin.
This year, Harvard has seen a similar debate over the role of symbols and names tied to slavery. University administrators made the switch from House master to Faculty Dean earlier this semester, after students and administrators said they were uncomfortable with the former term.

Robert Jain, an investment banker at Credit Suisse, joined the Harvard Management Company in March as the newest member of the board of directors and the fourth person added to the body since last August.
In March, Jain announced he would be leaving his role as global head of Credit Suisse Asset Management in June to join Millennium Management, a hedge fund, as its co-chief investment officer.
“We are very pleased to add Bob who just joined and attended his first meeting in March,” Paul J. Finnegan ’75, the University’s treasurer, wrote in an email.
At Credit Suisse, Jain oversees the investment bank's $325 billion money management division, managing the assets of large pension funds, private foundations, and other institutions with significant endowments.
Jain became known at Credit Suisse for reinventing the firm’s asset management division, taking a “boutique” approach to its targeting of clients by focusing on the sovereign wealth fund sector of the asset management business.
Since Stephen Blyth took over as President and CEO of the Management Company in January 2015, HMC—which oversees the University’s $37.6 billion endowment—has seen major reorganization, both in terms of personnel as well as investment policy.
In recent years, Harvard’s endowment performance has come become a source of concern for consistent underperformance relative to peer institutions. Blyth took over for Jane L. Mendillo with the goal of increasing returns.
On the personnel side, HMC has added four new members to its board, increasing the total number of board members. In addition to Jain’s appointment this month, the Management Company added Economics professor and former Federal Reserve board member Jeremy C. Stein and Joshua S. Friedman, founder of private equity firm Canyon Partners, last August.
In the fall, the Management Company added Amy C. Falls, the chief investment officer of Rockefeller University. In addition, long-time HMC portfolio manager and head of alternative assets Andrew G. Wiltshire retired at the end of 2015 after 14 years at the Management Company, where he played a major role in its investments in timberlands and forests.
Last September, Blyth announced plans for a overhaul of HMC’s method of fund allocation, calling for a risk factor-based approach. The impact of the changes will be available for the first time in September 2016, when his first full fiscal year of investment results will be released.

Native American artist Matika Wilbur addressed issues of cultural marginalization and the violation of women’s rights in indigenous populations through her photography exhibition at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study on Thursday.
The Institute hosted the exhibition in partnership with the Harvard University Native American Program as part of Radcliffe’s Initiative on Native and Indigenous Peoples, a series of programming consisting of lectures, conferences, exhibitions, seminars, and archival research focused on the study of indigenous peoples.
Wilbur, a member of the Tulalip and Swinomish tribes in Washington state, is the creator of Project 562, a collection of her work from photographs of each of the then 562—now 566—federally recognized tribes in the United States. The Radcliffe exhibition, titled “Seeds of Culture: The Portraits and Stories of Native American Women,” is a hand-picked selection from the project focused on native and indigenous women in honor of Radcliffe’s historical affiliation with women.
“In our exhibition, the portraits and stories of Native American women are here to tell you their own stories,” Wilbur said. “Native women’s suffering and loss are part of the indigenous value that must be respected, it must be a concern to us all. I though, have found a treasure trove of knowledge, strength and vision.”
Wilbur was inspired to begin her work on Project 562 to address the misrepresentation of Native Americans in American culture.
Yukio Lippit,  a professor of History of Art and Architecture, lauded Wilbur’s work.
“She began to develop a monumental aspiration that has led to her work today to help develop a body of imagery and cultural representations of native peoples to counteract the relentlessly incipient, one-dimensional cultural stereotypes,” he said. “To create, in her own words, positive indigenous role models to do justice to the richness, diversity, and lived experiences of Indian country.”
Wilbur's project evolved to include the social injustice and resulting political and economic hardship she discovered throughout her travels to native communities, she said, pointing to what she described as the abuse and exploitation of indigenous women as a focal point of her exhibit.
“These experiences articulate our current socioeconomic situation. Native American women are the most victimized in the country,” Wilbur said, citing statistics that indicate high instances of sexual assault and domestic abuse among Native American women. “For most native women, it is not a question of if, but when.”
Wilbur also advocated for educational reform to combat the academic challenges endured by indigenous students. According to her, Native students also have a very high rate of dropping out of high school.
“It might be time to create nurturing environments for our Indian students to succeed,” she said.
Kostas Koutsioumpas, a Ph.D. student at the University of Massachusetts Boston, admired that Wilbur’s work not only addressed both the socio-political hardships native communities suffer but also conveyed their spirituality.
“Apart from integrating the cultural genocide that has been happening, it also integrates the ability to have a strong resilience and the empowerment of people who manage to keep their own identity,” Koutsioumpas said.

Photographs from around the world are scattered throughout the third floors of the Harvard Peabody and Natural History Museums this week as a part of a pop-up exhibit called “Global Exposure.”
Hosted by the Harvard Business School Art Society, this week’s project marks the second year in which the student group collaborated with the Harvard Peabody and Natural History Museums to publicly display the photographs.  According to project director and Art Society member Raghav Iyengar, the contest asks Business School students to take pictures from trips they take and to submit their best two photographs to a panel of judges.
 “Typically because it’s done in connection with the Natural History Museum, we have two major categories: photos depicting the flora and fauna of place, that could mean wildlife, that could mean landscape or anything else. The other one is depicting people and cultures,” he said.
Sylvie Laborde, assistant director of the Museum of Natural History and one of the judges on the panel for the project, said she looked for unexpected elements when selecting the photos.
“I kind of like that surprise factor, something where you look at it and you’re like ‘oh.’ It’s people in a totally different setting, not the touristy picture, but you feel like you’re right there and it’s everyday life,” she said.
Around 40 photos were submitted this year, but only 15 were selected for display, according to Iyengar.
Business School student Rahima F. Dosani said she was inspired by the women featured in one of her two photographs that the judges selected. The photograph was from a visit to a tea plantation during a trip to India earlier this year.
“The actual women are incredible. They pluck 3,000 bushels of tea a day, and with 80 types of tea. It’s a busy place. They supply a lot of tea to global brands,” Dosani said. “Its cool to see local entrepreneurship grow to reach a global scale.”
The winning photographs are on display throughout the third floors of the buildings housing the museums, mixed in with the permanent exhibits. Museum visitors can see the photographs until May 2.

Kicking off the 24th annual Arts First Festival, Frank O. Gehry became the first architect to receive the annual Harvard Arts Medal from University President Drew G. Faust in a ceremony Thursday afternoon.
Faust, who called Gehry “a master of space,” praised him for his achievements.
“He created not only a new vocabulary, but to quote a Harvard architecture professor, he created a new vocabulary for the field of architecture,” she said.
Founded in 1995, the Arts Medal annually recognizes a Harvard alumnus or faculty member who has made significant contributions to the arts or arts education. A committee of faculty, alumni, and administrators works with the Office for the Arts to select the recipient each year.
 Gehry studied urban planning at the Graduate School of Design in the 1950s. While he did not finish his degree, he received an honorary doctorate in 2000.
The ceremony took place in Farkas Hall and included a conversation moderated by actor John A. Lithgow ’67, who described Gehry as “the most innovative and arguably the best architect working in the field these days.”
Gehry talked about his professional setbacks, including abandoned projects and his frustration about sometimes being unable to be fully involved throughout the whole design and construction process.
“To be an architect, for me, meant from beginning to end you were responsible for every part of the building, which doesn’t happen anymore. I wanted to run the show. I wanted to be the master builder,” Gehry said.
Gehry also discussed how his relationships with artists and new technologies made his design innovations possible.
“I try to put notes together from inert materials to make a feeling,” he said. “I’ve searched for a long time for a way to do this, and I try to express movement as an alternate form of decoration. We have movement all around us and with the computer, I was able to demystify that.”
Toward the end of the event, Gehry encouraged new architects to be persistent in the field.
“I think you have to stay the course. There’s no formula, just to be yourself and to not give up,” he said.
While there was not large student attendance at the event, students who did attend lauded Gehry.
“He’s such an influential figure not only in the architectural world but in the general art world. He educates people about space in the general world,” Ana J. Novak, a Graduate School of Education student, said.
The ceremony marks the start of Arts First, the annual visual and performing arts festival coordinated by the Office for the Arts. Running through Sunday, the festival will include student-led productions and installations of student artwork.

The Nieman Foundation for Journalism announced Tuesday that 24 journalists have been selected for the 2017 class of Nieman Fellows, ranging from reporters and filmmakers, to news executives.
 Now in the program's 79th year, the Nieman Foundation annually selects journalists to spend an academic year at Harvard and attend lectures, seminars, and conferences to develop their journalistic skills. The next class includes the Washington Post's former Tehran bureau chief Jason Rezaian, who spent over a year jailed in an Iranian prison after being charged with espionage before being released this January.
Nieman Deputy Curator James Geary said the program seeks to identify rising stars in journalism.
“We’re looking for journalists and fellows that we see real potential for growth, experimentation, and innovation and leadership in the industry moving forward,” he said. “The fruits of the fellowship are the rest of the fellow’s career as it unfolds.”
The fellows have experience in various fields of journalism and come from around the world, including the United Kingdom, Nepal, and South Korea.
“What we look for in every class and what makes this class so exciting is the mix of experience and expertise,” Geary said.
Tyler Dukes, a public records reporter for WRAL News in North Carolina, said he looks forward to being a fellow.
“I think the Nieman has a history of looking at how to move journalism forward,” he said.
Dukes said he will be studying specifically in the field of data journalism in the hopes of generating “better story ideas that gives us a more complete picture of public policy.”
Lolly Bowean, a 2017 Fellow and reporter for the Chicago Tribune, said she hopes to broaden her perspective and incite change in the journalistic realm. In particular, she said she is looking forward to reporting on people of color with “more analysis, depth, and historical context” through the fellowship.
“For years, I have quietly watched as others finished the fellowship and returned to the news industry brighter, and stronger and more brilliant, refined and prolific. Quite frankly, I just want to be in that number,” Bowean said. “I want to learn how to elevate my craft and use my talents and abilities in a more resounding way.”
Felicia Fonseca, a 2017 fellow and an Arizona-based correspondent for the Associated Press, said she hopes to expand her outlook on journalism through the fellowship.
“There comes a point where you feel like you’re stuck in a rut, you can’t dig below the surface on a lot of stories,” she said.  “[Through the fellowship], you could gain some new insight into what you’re covering.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking over a slideshow of his photography, video, and audio recordings, photographer Richard Ross presented his work shedding light on the juvenile prison system on Wednesday at the Harvard Kennedy School.
At the event, organized by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management, Ross said he aimed to paint a picture of how this system operates and the youth who come through it.
“I’m trying to figure out what the role of the artist is, in terms of shaping public policy. That’s the interesting battle that I am facing,” Ross said.
For the past several years, Ross has been going around the country, photographing and studying staff and prisoners in juvenile detention facilities as part of his “Juvenile in Justice” project, and creating art expositions to raise public awareness.
Ross said his work requires persistence and stubbornness, telling the audience of his struggles gaining access to places that are otherwise outside the public eye.
“I am trying to make images that will haunt you. I try to do things that you can’t forget and have to be responsible for,” Ross said.
Ross’s presentation featured images of solitary confinement cells, punishment methods, and suicide prevention mechanisms in these centers, juxtaposed with the background stories of the youth sent to serve time in them.
“I try to explain that kids in this world are often defined by the actions of the worst day of their lives,” Ross said.
Ross said his work has to take into account the youths’ identities, including family background, race, and mental health. Recurring themes in their background stories include physical and mental abuse, sexual assault, neglect, and parental substance addiction, he said.
“We’ve criminalized normal adolescent misbehavior. And we’ve selectively criminalized it,” Ross told the audience.
Audience member Antoine Rostagnat said he came to the presentation out of curiosity towards how the U.S. approaches the issue of juvenile detention.
“The one thing that really struck me is that at seven years-old, kids are able to be tried as adults [in some states],” Rostagnat said. “And I’m really trying to figure that out. Why is it like that? When in the first place was it ever like that? And why is it not changing?”

Amid songs, speeches, and roaring applause, Harvard administrators unveiled a portrait of Richard T. Greener, Class of 1870, the College’s first African American graduate, in Annenberg Hall.
The portrait, which depicts Greener in front of his former home of Stoughton Hall, was unmasked by Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations Director S. Allen Counter, following a performance by the Kuumba Singers and addresses by students and alumni.
Students presented Greener’s portrait as part of the Harvard Foundation’s portraiture project, which aims to diversify the artwork—a majority of which currently honors white male alumni and faculty—decorating Harvard buildings. Administrators have hung portraits since 2005 as part of the project, including a portrait of Native American graduate Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, Class of 1665, in Annenberg.
Those speaking at the ceremony expressed deep admiration for Greener, who went on to law school and later became the University of South Carolina’s first black faculty member.  In 1878, Greener was appointed as Dean of the Howard University School of Law. As an undergraduate, Greener won the Bowdoin prize for elocution in 1868 and 1870.
 Sheldon K. Reid ’96, director of the Kuumba Singers, said he found it “mind-blowing” that Greener was able to graduate from the College without structures that directly supported students of color—ones like the Kuumba Singers that Reid said provided relief and solidarity during his time as an undergraduate.
“It’s incredibly important that we get a chance to honor, to recognize, one of the giants on whose shoulders we stand,” Reid said. “Someone who opened doors that I was able to walk through, someone who blazed trails that I was able to follow.”
He added that the portrait will also be helpful in reminding future students of color of their place at Harvard.
“They can be reminded that [Greener] was worthy, and that likewise they are worthy,” Reid said.
Harvard Foundation intern Devontae A. Freeland ’19 voiced similar sentiments, calling Greener “a shining example of the African American legacy.” Freeland, a Phillips Academy Andover graduate, also noted that Greener was the first African American alumnus of his high school.
Colin H. Marts ’16, a member of the Harvard Black Men’s Forum, said seeing Greener’s portrait made him “overflow with feelings of comfort.”
“My institution is making such an effort to value black life,” Marts said.
Still, he added that Harvard “has significantly more to do” in reconciling a painful past. This year—which marks a tumultuous period for campus race relations nationwide—Harvard undergraduates have advocated changing controversial campus symbols and names, hiring more faculty of color, and removing the College’s controversial “House master” title. In February, the College abandoned that title in favor of “Faculty Dean.”
Harvard has added diverse portraiture to facilities, a suggestion also voiced by students, since as early as 2005. In addition to Greener’s, other portraits include Archie C. Epps, one of Harvard’s first African American administrators, and Eileen Jackson Southern, the first black woman to become a tenured Harvard faculty. Earlier this year, a portrait of Reverend Peter J. Gomes became the first portrait of a person of color to reside on the walls of the storied Faculty Room in University Hall.

A $21 million gift from the Lee Kum Kee family has established the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard School of Public Health, the school announced last week at a signing ceremony in Hong Kong.
The Lee Kum Kee family, who runs the Hong Kong-based Lee Kum Kee Sauce Group and LKK Health Products Group, chose to name the Center after their ancestor, Lee Kum Sheung, who invented oyster sauce in China in 1888.
According to the Center’s website, the Center’s goal is to bring together researchers across several disciplines, including health communications, medicine, and psychology, in order to investigate the connections between external factors of psychological well-being and their effect on physical health.
“Public health is very much focused on how do we help people live healthier, longer, and now also happier lives,” Julie F. Rafferty, associate vice dean for communications at HSPH, said.
Although not the first project to investigate this relationship, this endeavor represents a continuing “paradigm shift” in the field of public health to look at not only risk factors, but also social and environmental factors that can result in adverse effects on health, according to Laura D. Kubzansky, a professor of social and behavioral science and co-director of the Center.
“One of the priorities of the Center is to think about health from a fundamentally different perspective,” Kubzansky said. “With the establishment of the Center, we will have the opportunity to do this in a more systematic way.”
Much of the research in public health is often dominated by investigating diseases and disease prevention, according to health communication professor and Center co-Director Kasisomayajula Viswanath. The new Center, he added, presents the opportunity to better understand optimal health by looking beyond solely disease-related factors.
“Our healthcare system is organized in treating diseases,” he said. “If you define a problem from the perspectives of a disease, then the solutions you offer are to treat that particular disease.”
According to Kubzansky, the Center is already “off and running.” In the future, she said she hopes the Center will be able to use its research to influence public policy and train the next generation of scholars of the field.
The donation is one of many large pledges made to the School of Public Health in recent years. In 2014, billionaire Gerald L. Chan’s $350 million gift to the school, the largest single donation in Harvard’s history at the time, led to it being renamed after Chan's late father.
Harvard recently surpassed its public goal of $6.5 billion in its capital campaign, breaking a higher education fundraising record. Prior to the Chan gift, the School of Public Health had initially set a fundraising goal of $450 million. HSPH administrators declined to comment on their progress relative to their capital campaign goals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 29, 2016, at 1:57 a.m.
Staging a rally and delivering a letter to University President Drew G. Faust’s office, graduate students on Thursday demanded that Harvard remain neutral and not interfere as they push for the right to form a union.
 A group of more than 400 students, faculty, and politicians gathered at the Science Center Plaza Thursday afternoon to stage the rally, which culminated in the delivery of the letter—from the unionization effort Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers—to Massachusetts Hall demanding Harvard refrain from any actions that would “delay graduate employees’ right to choose collective bargaining.”
Over 50 Massachusetts state legislators signed the letter, according to Ph.D. student and union organizer Abigail Weil, and other signatories included labor leaders and College students. Faust was not present to accept the letter.
Last spring, graduate students began a movement to unionize, citing the need for the University to recognize students employed by Harvard as workers, and for a representative body to protect their rights.
Top University administrators, including Faust, have repeatedly affirmed their opposition to a union, saying such a move could fundamentally change the relationship between graduate students and Harvard from one of teaching to one based in labor.
In October, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences administrators circulated a letter encouraging faculty to “explain the disadvantages of union membership” to graduate students. However, the document explicitly discouraged hostility toward prospective union members, saying specifically that faculty and administrators should not “threaten” students who support the union with “adverse consequences." In March, Harvard filed an amicus brief to the National Labor Relations Board expressing opposition to graduate student unionization.
Members of the graduate student union effort have called such actions a violation of the neutrality they think Harvard should maintain as they work to form a union. Their letter also demands Harvard refrain from “any effort to influence RAs and TAs in their decision” to vote on whether to unionize and “commence good-faith negotiations for a contract immediately upon confirmation of a majority vote.”
"We will continue to encourage an open, balanced conversation a bout graduate student unionization," Faculy of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Anna Cowenhoven wrote in a statement. "We continue to believe that the relationship between graduate students and a university is fundamentally about education, not employment, and changing that relationship could be damaging and disruptive to graduate education and the graduate student experience."
The event was also a celebration of the majority support, now independently verified by the the American Arbitration Association, that the union effort has among the graduate students Harvard employs.
Graduate students, labor leaders, state and local politicians, and Harvard professors spoke at the event, where organizers displayed the “white boards” of written student support they collected over the course of the past year.
Economics professor Stephen A. Marglin said, “My message is: let the graduate students decide.”
Weil, who led the event, said the union effort has also circulated a neutrality pledge to faculty, urging them to refrain from “public statements, one-on-one meetings, distribution of literature, or any other active campaigning or activities.” She said the petition has  “a few dozen” signatures.
“What [professors] need to understand is that it actually has nothing to do with them, so that’s been the thrust of the neutrality pledge,” Weil said.
The NLRB is deliberating on whether or not private institutions must recognize democratically elected graduate student unions. Harvard’s union effort comes in the midst of a flurry of graduate student organizing across the country, including at other private institutions such as Yale and Columbia.
“Harvard needs to understand this: this is a national movement, it’s not going away,” United Auto Workers representative Ellen Wallace said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year has not been a peaceful one for Harvard’s unrecognized final clubs. After months of intense administrative pressure to reform membership policies, a University-wide task force report in March took the clubs to task for “a culture often inimical to Harvard’s mission.” Citing data from a University-wide sexual misconduct survey conducted last year in tandem with the Association of American Universities, the report argued that single-gender final clubs significantly contribute to campus sexual assault.
“The qualitative and quantitative information before us is deeply troubling and requires a strong response from Harvard,” the task force wrote.
On Wednesday, though, a professional statistical analyst, commissioned by the 225-year old Porcellian Club, sharply criticized the Harvard sexual assault prevention task force’s interpretation of survey data and recommendations for action on final clubs.
The analysis, conducted by statistical firm Welch Consulting employee Jora B. Stixrud and sent to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana Wednesday, focused on two figures central to the task force’s recommendations: 47 and “at least 15.”
Forty-seven represents the percent of female College seniors surveyed by the College “participating in the Final Clubs” who reported experiencing “nonconsensual sexual contact” during their undergraduate years, while more than 15 represents the percent of women reporting “nonconsensual penetration involving physical force” who said the incident occurred at a space used by a single-gender social organization that was not a fraternity or a sorority.
In a letter to Khurana accompanying Stixrud’s 14-page analysis, newly-instated graduate president of the Porcellian, David T. Lawrence ’67 wrote that the club commissioned the report because of what he called Harvard’s unwillingness to respond to “expressed concern about the statistical analyses” of the sexual assault prevention task force.
Lawrence wrote that he took issue with “repeated public statements by Harvard officials incorrectly implying that the 2015 AAU survey established statistically a direct connection between sexual assault and final clubs.”
“Harvard’s persistent use of misleading talking points has distracted the public and the student body from the undisputed fact established by the Final Report that the vast majority of sexual assaults occur on Harvard property under Harvard control,” Lawrence argued. 
According to the AAU survey, 87 percent of on-campus “nonconsensual penetration involving physical force” among female students occurred in Harvard dormitories, which task force chair and former University Provost  Steven E. Hyman wrote was “[c]onsistent with a residential campus such as Harvard College” in a letter published alongside the survey results in September.
In a recent letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal, University Spokesperson Jeff Neal emphasized the importance of the 47 percent statistic, adding that “While the data shows there is no single cause of sexual assault, it is clear that the social dynamics fostered by single-gender social organizations warrant our sustained attention.”
Lawrence wrote that the Porcellian believes in the “central message” of the Task Force report “that sexual assault at Harvard is a very serious problem requiring immediate attention and effective action.” The Porcellian “has an important part to play in reducing sexual assault,” he added.
Concluding, Lawrence wrote that he would share the analysis and letter—both of which were obtained by The Crimson—with graduate leaders of all other final clubs. Another graduate member of the Porcellian said that neither Welch nor Stixrud had any previous affiliation with the club, and that Welch was paid a regular hourly rate.
Khurana, through College Spokesperson Rachael Dane, declined to comment for this story.  Hyman also declined to comment.
Neal welcomed any scrutiny to the University’s sexual misconduct survey and the task force’s prevention recommendations.
“The final report of Harvard’s Task Force on the Prevention of Sexual Assault and the sexual conduct survey results speak for themselves,” Neal  wrote in an email. “ Both are posted online and we welcome any interested party to review them in detail.”
‘CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION’
Welch’s analysis, titled “The AAU Sexual Assault Survey Data Cannot Substantiate Claims Regarding Harvard Final Clubs,” had three main criticisms of the 47 percent statistic.
First, Stixrud, who holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago, argued that the task force report conflates correlation and causation, calling the distinction between the two “one of the first lessons taught in most introductory statistics courses.”
Stixrud called any claims of causality between the final clubs and sexual assault prevalence “particularly weak” in relation to the 47 percent statistic, because the survey “does not ask about the timing of the sexual contact vis-a-vis the timing of involvement in the Clubs.”
“A woman who received an unwanted kiss in her dorm room while a freshman would be counted as part of this figure if she later joined an all-female Final Club in her sophomore year,” Stixrud wrote.
Second, the analysis posited that even the wide disparity between the average rate of nonconsensual sexual contact among senior College women in different student groups and the 47 percent rate reported by women who “participated in clubs,” could be the result of imprecision in weighting the raw data to account for non-respondents.
Stixrud argued that women participating in various activities could further skew activity-specific statistics, as any one of a woman’s affiliated activities could hypothetically contribute to the risk of sexual assault.
“[T]he exact statistical tests cannot be performed without the underlying data, which Harvard has not disclosed… All of the correlations between membership or participation in these groups and nonconsensual sexual contact are most likely statistically indistinguishable,” she argued.
“In short,” Stixrud added, “There is no statistical evidence to support the singling out of Final Clubs as opposed to other student organizations.”
Third, Stixrud argued that the term “participation,” used by the survey to determine whether a woman was involved with final clubs, was “too nebulous to be meaningful.” A woman who participated in recruitment or joined an all-female club, a woman who attended parties at an all-female club, or a woman who attended events at an all-male club could all considered participants in final clubs, according to Stixrud.
In a footnote, the task force’s report specified that “we interpret ‘participate’ as meaning primarily non-member interaction with the all-male Final Clubs through social and other related events, as well as any assaults experienced by women who have joined one of the all-women Final Clubs.”
As a comparison, Stixrud added that the number of women self-reporting “participation” in “Campus Varsity Sports” was 165 and that, by Stixrud’s count, there were “about 80 or 90” female senior varsity athletes when the survey was administered, meaning some women who were not members of a varsity team could have been counted participants.
Allison L.  Miller, assistant director of Athletic Communications, said that she thinks the number of female varsity athletes in the class of 2015 was likely much higher than Stixrud’s count, though she said she could not provide an exact number by press time.
“Regardless of whether the true number of female senior varsity athletes is actually 80, 100, or 150—‘participation’ in varsity athletics is open to interpretation by the students who responded to the survey,” Stixrud wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Stixrud’s other main criticism of the survey’s finding involved the percentage of sexual assault incidents reported at single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities.
In the fall, Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of the University’s sexual assault task force who helped design the AAU survey, said he “would assume that most students who identify that space are thinking about final clubs.”
Stixrud disagreed, writing that “this assumption is problematic for multiple reasons.”
More than 15 percent of women reporting “nonconsensual penetration involving physical force” on University property indicated that the incident occurred in space used by a single-sex organization that was not a fraternity or a sorority. The corresponding statistic for nonconsensual penetration by force on off-campus university property used by a single-sex organization was too small and therefore “suppressed” for confidentiality reasons.
Given that final clubs operate on private property, Stixrud wrote, “either many of the respondents are confused, or they must mean something other than Final Clubs when they select a single-sex student social organization on University property as the location of the incident.”
Stixrud also wrote that the statistic “cannot possibly tell us anything about what is going on in any of the individual clubs, nor does it begin to account for differences in access to non-members provided by the various Final Clubs.” The Porcellian Club, for instance, has a strict no-guest policy.
“In sum,” Stixrud concluded. “This survey does not contain any data that would allow an analyst to support the recommendations of the Task Force that pertain to Final Clubs.”
While Hyman declined comment for this story, in a statement earlier this week, responding to another critique, he wrote that task force recommendations “were based not only on the AAU sexual conduct survey, but also on the extensive qualitative data gathered at scores of meetings with Harvard undergraduates.”
Stixrud’s analysis focused solely on the publicly-available survey data.
“I have not reviewed the qualitative reports because they have not been made publicly available, but they would not change my conclusions about the survey evidence,” Stixrud wrote in an email.
Schuyler H. Daum ’12, a recent alumna of the all-female IC club, said the task force’s report seemed accurate to her based on her undergraduate years.
“The results of the campus climate survey are not surprising—based on my experience and based on the research,” Daum, who worked at the Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response as an undergraduate, said. “Studies show that women who are in sororities are more likely to be sexually assaulted in college—presumably because they are more likely to end up in alcohol-rich, single-sex environments. This same dynamic is playing out at Harvard for women who participate in final clubs.”
Daum said that “the conversation should be about the final clubs creating safer spaces and aligning themselves with 21st-century values by admitting women,” rather than an argument over statistics, which Daum called “frustrating.”
Stixrud’s report comes at a time of unprecedented scrutiny for Harvard’s single-gender final clubs. In September, University President Drew G. Faust publicly criticized the clubs, and even the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, has been involved in discussions with Khurana on how best to oversee the centuries-old organizations.
In the fall, the traditionally all-male Spee and Fox clubs accepted women into their membership. In a letter explaining their decisions to graduate members, Fox undergraduates wrote that administrators had “forced [their] hand.”
The Porcellian’s analysis also comes at a time when concern over possible administrative sanctions for undergraduates in final clubs, particularly against all-male clubs, has driven club leaders to more pointedly criticize administrators. Then-graduate president of the Porcellian and the current graduate president of the Fly Club both made statements criticizing administrative pressure of final clubs, with both accusing top administrators of some ulterior motives in scrutinizing the clubs.
Khurana is expected to submit a plan to address task force recommendations, including those on final clubs, by the end of this academic year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just before it became the first Ivy League team to crack the top 10 of the ESPN recruiting ranking lists, the Harvard men’s basketball team signaled that it wasn’t satisfied. On Saturday, the No. 2 overall recruit in the Class of 2017, Wendell Carter Jr., announced that his first official visit will be going to Harvard in the fall.
Carter Jr., who has been ranked among the top 10 prospects for the Class of 2017 all year, listed Harvard alongside Duke, North Carolina, Kansas, and Kentucky as his choices last weekend at the Nike EYBL. He is the most prominent prospect to ever take an official visit to Cambridge; rumors of Mohamed Bamba—a similarly high-quality prospect in the Class of 2017—taking a visit to Harvard a couple weeks ago proved to be unsubstantiated, per sources close to the athletics department.
The prospect had previewed the move in early January, when he announced on his USA Today blog that he was “planning to visit Harvard … soon”. In that same post, Carter Jr. discussed a common theme surrounding his recruitment—his tie to Gary Trent Jr., a fellow five-star guard. The two have discussed their recruitment as a package deal, with Carter Jr. putting the chance that they play together at “maybe 75 percent”. Trent Jr. has not been tied yet to Harvard, however.
Carter Jr. also noted on Saturday that he and Trent will be visiting Kentucky for Big Blue Madness, the school’s midnight festival introducing its basketball team for the upcoming season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

“I was the smallest person in my high school struggling to find a sport that I could be involved in, being so small,” freshmen men’s heavyweight coxswain Jennie Kunes explained.
At 4’11”, Kunes would not strike the average passerby as a Division 1 female athlete, much less a member of a men’s team.  However, Kunes and four other Harvard women are key members of the Harvard men’s rowing programs.
SMALL BUT IMPORTANT
Outside the world of rowing, the role of the coxswain is often unknown or misunderstood. Who are the people sitting in the boat, but not actually rowing? What even are they doing?
In order for a boat to make it down the river as quickly as possible, the rowers must be working hard and have their strokes in sync, and the boat must take the fastest course possible.
Although the coxswain does not contribute physically to the boat speed by rowing, he or she is responsible for ensuring that all three of these things happen to ensure the best results possible.
A good coxswain must motivate and inspire his or her rowers to push themselves physically harder than they could alone, feel when the rowers are executing their strokes precisely and efficiently and instruct them to adjust accordingly, and make quick judgments during pieces and races to steer the boat.
“There’s a lot of trust put in [coxswains],” sophomore men’s heavyweight coxswain Jacqueline Goodman said. “You’re the person in charge of where the boat is going to go, the coach’s partner who directs the rowers when the coach is not there, and the one pushing the guys to keep going and get as much as they possibly can out of a piece.”
Another important element of the coxswain is that since he or she is not pulling his or her weight by rowing, the lighter he or she is, the better. For collegiate men’s rowing, both the minimum and maximum weight for coxswains is 125 lbs. Ideally, the coxswain’s weight is as close to 125lbs as possible so that he or she does not weigh down the boat any more than necessary. Coxswains under the weight minimum must carry sand bag weights with them in the boat to ensure fairness in competition.
There are many more college aged women who are around 125 pounds than men. Thus, men’s crew teams often recruit female coxswains and encourage even inexperienced girls of the right build to try out.
The unique role of coxswains encourages individuals who may not otherwise participate in collegiate athletics to be able to complete.
“It’s such a unique opportunity to participate in college athletics when you’re not necessarily built for athletics,” said Kunes. “I did soccer and track in high school… but I was just too small.”
ONE OF THE GUYS
Being a female athlete on a men’s team is a unique situation. However, both coaches and athletes from Harvard’s men’s crew programs have stressed that in the boat, gender does not matter.
“It is all about the personality of each individual coxswain,” Ian Accomando, assistant coach of lightweight crew, said. “If they are a competitor, have a good work ethic and a high level of achievement, then they are going to fit in just fine whether they are a boy a or a girl.”
Female coxswains often specifically choose to work with men’s crews for various reasons, and are comfortable with looking past gender before they even enter the boat house.
For example, Goodman grew up with a brother and always had a lot of guy friends. Besides already being comfortable around guys, she was drawn to the level of intensity that being on a men’s team provided her.
“I get to push myself to match the guy’s intensity and go for more when they want to go for more,” Goodman said. “You have to take yourself seriously in order to demand the respect of the guys…. but it’s less about what gender you are and all about how well you’re performing. It’s a lot about being there - showing up to do the work.”
“Heavyweight men go fastest… that was my criteria.” Kunes said.
The intensity and competitive nature of the sport enables gender distinctions to not matter.
“All it comes down to is who can best execute the job,” Accomando said. “The guys in the boat are willing to take criticism, inspiration and direction from anyone. We have no problems in that respect.”
However, even though Kunes always knew she wanted to cox on the heavyweight men’s team in college, when she first arrived at Harvard’s Newell boathouse she was in for a surprise.
At Harvard, the men’s and women’s boathouses are separate. The women’s program operates out of Weld boathouse on the Cambridge side of the river, while the men’s boathouse is across the river in Allston.
“In was a weird situation at first when I realized that the boathouse was made specifically for men,” Kunes said. “There are no women’s locker rooms. There’s a little closet that has probably ten lockers in it that the coxswains use and there’s a bathroom next to it we can use, but it’s the public restroom.”
Regardless of gender, one of the most important qualities of a coxswain is the bond he or she builds with his or her boat.
“There’s a lot of relatability between each coxswain and their boat because you grow with the rowers and understand what the technical changes and the sort of motivation that works best to make that boat go fastest,” Goodman said. “The most important thing for a coxswain is that you relate to your boat well and you find your community within your boat.”
Specific scenarios such as showering, travelling, and having to find time outside of practice to work out do pose additional challenges for female coxswains.
When the team travels, the coxswains room together, separate from the boys; and Accomando joked about how the one place thing the female coxswains are excluded from is the “shower banter.”
“People ask me a lot ‘do you work out with the guys?’” Goodman said. “No I don’t personally. Some coxswains do, but I run. I really like running. So when I’m actually coxing, I’m just sitting there, which means there’s an extra initiative that I have to take since I have to budget in time outside of practice for working out whereas all other athletes get their workout in during practice.”
However, despite these challenges, the experience of being a female athlete on a men’s team is extremely rewarding.
“Both being a cox and being a girl on a team really forces you not to take your status as a teammate for granted,” Jennie said. “It might seem easy to separate yourself from the team, so instead you have to never let off on being motivated and truly invested. Ultimately this is a good thing since when you follow through with that it makes you closer to the team and the team better.”

As the end of the season looms, the Harvard men’s baseball team (16-21, 8-8 Ivy) is hitting its stride. The Crimson won for the seventh time in nine games Tuesday at LeLacheur Park, defeating UMass Lowell (17-20), 9-4, in its final nonconference game of the season. After dropping eight of 10 earlier in the month, including the first four conference contests of the season, Harvard has gone 9-6.
“I thought we played a pretty good game,” sophomore pitcher TJ Laurisch said.
The Crimson did not leave the outcome in doubt in its first game against the River Hawks in program history. The team immediately took control, jumping out to a 5-1 lead after two frames to stake starter Shaun Rubin to an early lead. UMass Lowell starting pitcher Ricky Constant had problems from the first batter; giving up a double to junior catcher Josh Ellis to start the game. Back-to-back singles from sophomore infielder Matt Rothenberg and freshman firstbaseman Patrick McColl drove home Ellis to put the Crimson on the board, before Constant got two strikeouts to end the first.
The two strikeouts did not settle Constant down, however. The freshman walked consecutive batters to start the top of the second. After Ellis laid down a sacrifice bunt to move the runners into scoring position, consecutive passed balls scored a pair of runs. After senior infielder Mitch Klug drew a walk, Rothenberg cleared the bases with a triple to left center and then scored on another passed ball to push the lead to 5-0.
UMass Lowell would get no closer than three runs the rest of the way as the Crimson tacked on two more runs in both the fourth and the ninth to prevent UMass Lowell from closing the gap. The River Hawks had just one run on four hits by the end of the second inning, and just three runs on four hits in the bottom of the seventh.
“I think [Constant] was a little erratic early on,” Rothenberg said. “We took some walks early on to get some guys in scoring position, bunted some guys over… Some guys got the big hit when we needed one.”
Constant would give up one more run in the second—on another Rothenberg double—before leaving the game. For the game, Rothenberg finished a home run short of the cycle, notching three hits for only the fourth time this season and the first time since a 5-2 win over Yale on April 17.
“I got a few good pitches to hit and just ran into a few balls, which is always great,” Rothenberg said. “It was just a good day.”
Freshman outfielder Ben Skinner, who was former Ivy League Rookie of the Week, and junior infielder Drew Reid, and senior center DJ Link also tallied base hits to help the Crimson offense.
When Harvard took the field, it used an unusual pitching strategy. Rubin, who gave up just two hits and one run through two innings, was pulled with his team up 5-1 in the bottom of the third. The left-hander, who had not allowed a run since the first game of the season, frequently pitches in middle relief for the Crimson. He had thrown more than two innings in just three of eight appearances earlier this year. Wednesday was Rubin’s first start of the year.
After Rubin came out, Harvard coach Bill Decker reached deep into his bullpen, using five different pitchers to hold the River Hawks to just three runs over the next seven innings.
Four of the five pitchers that took the mound—including two seniors and sophomore Dylan Combs, who earned the win for pitching a scoreless fourth and fifth frames—did not give up a single run, with sophomore Noah Zavolas being the only one to encounter trouble, giving up three runs in the seventh inning. Zavolas, whose ERA rose to 7.11 after the game, had two consecutive scoreless appearances in relief before Wednesday’s game.
After the game, the Harvard players deferred to the skipper on the rationale behind playing so many pitchers.
“Coach had a plan with certain pitchers he wanted to get in,” Rothenberg said. “It was time to get fresh pitchers in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a disappointing fourth-place Ivy League finish in 2016, the Harvard men’s basketball team showed why pundits think it is on the fast track back to the top of the league Wednesday, finishing with ESPN’s No. 10 recruiting class of the season. It is the first time an Ivy League team has ever cracked the top 25 of the recruiting rankings.
The Crimson cracked the top 20 on the strength of one of the largest and deepest recruiting classes in the nation. Harvard had seven recruits in the class, which matched Mississippi State (ranked No. 5 overall) for the most in the nation. Kentucky, which led the rankings, was the only other school with six or more prospects.
In addition to size, Harvard boasted a deep recruiting class that had four members of the ESPN top 100. The Crimson had assembled the class over the entirety of 2015, starting with the addition of power forward Chris Lewis (No. 68 overall) in January 2015. Lewis, the son of former New York Jets player Mo Lewis, was the highest ranked recruit ever to pick Harvard.
Lewis’ signing kicked off a trail of ensuing decisions. Five months later, small forward Seth Towns committed to Harvard, marking the first time the Crimson had ever received two top-100 recruits in the same season. Robert Baker Jr. and Bryce Aiken, four-star recruits from Georgia and New Jersey, respectively, committed during the late summer and early fall to bring the class together. All three players finished towards the bottom of the top 100, but their recruiting score was a single point lower than Lewis’.
Harvard’s success was atypical in the Ivy League, which did not enjoy a large recruiting haul outside of the Crimson. Two-time defending champion Yale receives a single three-star in 2016, South Carolina native Jordan Bruner. While Princeton brought in two three star recruits, the Tigers could not match the Crimson in either size (three total players) or depth (their best player ranked eight points worse than the Crimson’s best).
How each of the recruits will become involved in the framework of the team is unclear. The team faces a glut at the point guard position behind captains Siyani Chambers and Corbin Miller and last year’s starter Tommy McCarthy. Harvard coach Tommy Amaker could not offer any guidance on Aiken’s position before the end of the season. Lewis will likewise face a crowded big man rotation, needing to stand out alongside second-team All-Ivy Zena Edosomwan to find success.
