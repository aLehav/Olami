After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Drew G. Faust made just over $1.7 million in compensation in 2017, her last full year as Harvard’s president. While Faust’s tenure ended last June, current University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s compensation will not be released for another year.
Faust’s 2017 pay included $961,952 in base salary, $191,960 in nontaxable benefits, $534,140 in retirement and other deferred compensation, and $19,018 in other reportable compensation. The Harvard Corporation — the University’s highest governing body — decides each year how much deferred compensation will be paid to the University President. In 2017, the Corporation voted to credit Faust with $500,000, an increase from the $400,000 credited to her in 2016 and $300,000 in 2015.
Faust earned a total of $1.5 million in 2016 and $1.4 million in 2015.
Compensation for Faust and other top University officers was released Friday as part of the University’s Form 990 tax filings, which the Internal Revenue Service requires tax-exempt entities to submit annually.
Former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith, who stepped down at the end of the 2017-2018 school year, earned $730,382 in 2017. His successor — Claudine Gay — will not have her compensation in that role reported until next year. University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 made $880,900 in total compensation in 2017.
The University’s three highest compensated  faculty members all teach at Harvard Business School, as was the case last year. The highest compensated, Lynda M. Applegate, earned $1,495,642 in total compensation in 2017. More than $1,000,000 of Applegate’s pay and significant sums of other top-earning faculty is designated as “other reportable compensation” which can come from a variety of sources including deferred pay and awards for longevity of service. The tax form does not note the specific source.
Once again, the deans of the Business School and Medical School were Harvard’s highest-paid deans in 2017. In a reversal from 2016, however, 2017 compensation for the Medical School’s dean surpassed that of the Business School’s dean. Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 made $841,952 in his first full year in the role, while Business School Dean Nitin Nohria earned $839,358.
Top executives at Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University’s endowment, earned significantly more than Faust and other University executives. HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar earned just over $9.25 million in his first full year at Harvard. Compensation for Narvekar, who joined Harvard in late 2016 after managing Columbia’s endowment, includes $6.5 million in base pay and roughly $2.75 million to compensate for Narvekar’s departure from Columbia.
Former HMC real estate managing director Daniel W. Cummings earned $10,057,908 in 2017, a significant decrease from his $23,853,527 salary in 2016. His unusually high salary in 2016 included roughly $12.3 million vested in accordance with his tenure at HMC. Cummings and the HMC real estate team joined Bain Capital in January 2018, but continue to manage Harvard’s real estate holdings.
The six highest-paid HMC officials earned nearly $40.5 million combined, dwarfing the combined compensation of other top-earning University-level administrators. The 2017 fiscal year marked the last year that HMC employees received bonuses based on the success of their asset class performance. Starting fiscal year 2018, bonuses will be based on the overall performance of Harvard’s $39 billion endowment, which has continually underperformed its Ivy League peers.
Both the University and HMC have seen significant employee turnover since 2017, and as such, many current leaders — like Bacow, Gay, and HMC COO Sanjeev Daga — do not yet have reported earnings.
Correction: May 13, 2019
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Lynda Applegate's compensation was $1,495,676. In fact, she earned $1,495,642.
Clarification: May 13, 2019
A previous version of this article referred to the Harvard Business School faculty as some of the "highest paid" in the University. To clarify, the University refers to them as some of the "highest compensated" due to the way their compensation is reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 12, 2019 at 1:26 a.m.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that he will not renew Winthrop Faculty Deans Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. and Stephanie R. Robinson after their term ends on June 30 in an email to House affiliates Saturday morning.
The decision comes after more than three months of activism and outcry surrounding Sullivan’s decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein — who stands accused of rape — and a day after The Crimson reported allegations brought by Winthrop students, tutors, and staff of a toxic environment under Sullivan and Robinson stretching back years.
Khurana wrote in his email to Winthrop residents that he decided not to renew Sullivan and Robinson’s faculty dean appointments because the environment in the House was “untenable.”
“The actions that have been taken to improve the climate have been ineffective, and the noticeable lack of faculty dean presence during critical moments has further deteriorated the climate in the House,” Khurana wrote. “I have concluded that the situation in the House is untenable.”
Sullivan and Robinson wrote in an emailed statement to The Crimson they were surprised by the College’s decision and that Harvard “unilaterally” ended discussions they were having with University representatives.
“We are surprised and dismayed by the action Harvard announced today. We believed the discussions we were having with high level University representatives were progressing in a positive manner, but Harvard unilaterally ended those talks,” Sullivan and Robinson wrote. “We will now take some time to process Harvard’s actions and consider our options.”
“We are sorry that Harvard’s actions and the controversy surrounding us has contributed to the stress on Winthrop students at this already stressful time,” they added.
Though their decade-long term at Winthrop will end this summer, Sullivan and Robinson will keep their appointments at Harvard Law School, where they both teach. They are the first African Americans to serve as faculty deans of an undergraduate house.
Dozens of students met with Khurana, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay in Winthrop dining hall Saturday afternoon. Many hugged and thanked the administrators for their decision to not renew Sullivan and Robinson.
Students have criticized Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein since he first announced his decision in January.
Following that announcement, Sullivan wrote an email to Winthrop residents defending his decision and stressed the importance of representing the “unpopular defendant.” He later followed up with another missive announcing he had appointed Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers as the “point person” for issues surrounding sexual assault.
In the months after, student activists took to protests and online posts, arguing that Sullivan’s representation of Weinstein conflicts with his role as a faculty dean. In February, the College launched a “climate review” led by former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 to address student concerns.
The controversy later extended to other parts of the House. Last month, Winthrop tutors Carl L. Miller and Valencia Miller and Danu A.K. Mudannayake ’20 — an activist who organized the first calls for Sullivan step down — filed conflicting police reports after a confrontation in the Winthrop dining hall. Days later, the Millers sued Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe for defamation after she sent an email to Eliot residents defending Mudannayake’s account and calling the Millers’ response “unprofessional.”
On Friday, The Crimson reported that issues with Sullivan and Robinson’s leadership of the House began years before Sullivan announced he would represent Weinstein. Tutors and staff said that the pair targeted staff who reported concerns about the deans to administrators and that the deans created a difficult work environment.
In 2016, 13 resident tutors — more that half of that year’s roster — threatened to resign because they believed the faculty deans wanted to dismiss a tutor based on false accusations.
On-campus activists who led calls for Sullivan to step down said Saturday that they were shocked and excited by Khurana’s decision.
Mudannayake, who is also a Crimson design editor, said she woke up Saturday morning because her phone was buzzing with messages about the College’s decision not to renew Sullivan and Robinson. She said the rest of the day brought disbelief, then joy.
Winthrop resident Caroline R. Kaufman ’21, who co-wrote a post about the impact of Sullivan’s decision on people who have experienced sexual assault, said she entered the Winthrop dining hall Saturday afternoon to find a different environment from the one she experienced over the past several months.
“I went down to the dining hall after it happened when Rakesh was there and there were a lot of Winthrop staff members, and students there,” she said. “It was just the complete opposite of what the Winthrop dining hall environment has been for the last three months. It was just this happy, excited, relieved environment where everybody could talk about what they wanted to talk about.”
Though individual students like Mudannayake and Kaufman started organizing efforts against Sullivan, pre-existing student groups including anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better and the Association of Black Harvard Women often joined them. ABHW released a statement in February calling on Sullivan to step down, and Our Harvard Can Do Better staged a sit-in at Winthrop dining hall to “reclaim” the House.
ABHW President Kacey E. Gill ’20 said she felt a combination of “relief and happiness” about the announcement and also pointed to organizing efforts.
“I wish that it hadn't taken so long had it required so many students to put their mental health, well-being, and potentially even their futures on the line in order to get that change to occur. But it did happen, we are here now,” Gill said.
Remedy H. Ryan ’21, an Our Harvard Can Do Better organizer, said that, when the news of Sullivan’s representation first became public, she did not think the College would ever decide to let Sullivan and Robinson go.
“I guess a lot of people told us at the beginning of the semester that this couldn’t be done, and that Ron Sullivan had too much power and was too good at using it,” Ryan said. “This is kind of proof that collective organizing against rape culture can do a lot.”
In his email Saturday, Khurana wrote that he admires Sullivan and Robinson’s work on social justice. He called the decision not to renew them “regrettable.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email that the administration will likely search for new Winthrop deans through the summer and early fall in order to follow normal procedures and involve students and staff.
As the College begins their search, Chavers wrote in an email she hopes students, tutors, and staff can rest after a tumultuous semester.
“I am looking forward to a time of healing and improved conversation and communication for the Winthrop community,” Chavers wrote.
