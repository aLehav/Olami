After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Only a handful of rappers can call themselves the king of both New York and the West Coast, but few questioned Kendrick Lamar when he asserted his cross-continental reign in his standout verse on “Control.” Lamar’s  incredible success is understandable based on his unusually deeply personal lyrics and his understated beats. But in spite of these undeniable strengths,  Lamar’s fame is particularly surprising given his characteristically unique and unconventional rapping voice. Of course, every famous rapper—and every vocal artist, for that matter—has his or her own unique voice. However, the recent widespread embrace of Lamar and his different vocal sounds and tones—those that may be off-putting at first—represents and illustrates the greater movement in hip-hop towards artists with slightly bizarre and unusual voices, and an even greater social movement that hip hop is advancing.

 
Kendrick Lamar is not the only recent hip-hop artist with a unique voice to receive critical and commercial acclaim. But because of his prominence in the rap world, it is particularly important to examine his voice and its role in his success. Not only does Lamar have a uniquely high-pitched, particularly narrow voice—as best demonstrated on the hooks of “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” and “Real”—but he also, through computer effects, digitally manipulates his voice. Lamar develops a wide range of emotions through raising, lowering, fading, and multiplying his vocal tracks in tracks like “m.A.A.d City” and “Sing About Me, I’m Dying of Thirst.”
 
The acceptance of Lamar’s unconventional tone and omnipresent vocal effects not only speaks to his remarkable talent, but also to the bigger movement in hip-hop towards recognizing rappers with all sorts of different vocal tones. Chance The Rapper, who raps with a particularly childish voice, is another hip-hop artist whose meteoric rise illustrates the music community’s acceptance of rappers with different tones. Danny Brown has also received commercial and critical acclaim for his last two albums despite his piercing and shrill voice (and a correspondingly bizarre haircut). And of course we cannot forget Nicki Minaj, whose creative and constantly changing tone is completely unlike any rapper prior, male or female. These rappers voices are highly noticeable and decidedly rougher than the smooth voices of Jay-Z or Tupac. But because of the excitement of its originality, the hip-hop community at large has embraced Lamar and his counterparts.
 
This tendency of the hip-hop community to embrace change and originality extends beyond vocal stylings. Most notably, rap production—the sound behind the lyrics—has gone through remarkable and rapid changes, particularly within the last decade. In the past 10 years alone, rap production has gone through phases of  pitched-and-sped-up soul samples, lush R&B sounds, and minimalist electronica. Lamar did not only succeed because of  hip-hop’s acceptance of his voice; if the genre didn’t embrace Lamar’s sparse and quirkily mysterious production, he would have never achieved mainstream success.
 
Apart from its rapidly-changing forms of production, hip-hop frequently embraces new ideas and lyrical content. Lamar has particularly benefited from the acceptance of new ideas; his most recent album was filled with content about his profoundly difficult upbringing in Compton, a subject that has not been developed prominently in other genres. Additionally, hip-hop has recently facilitated previously understated messages of same-sex relationship support. The recent success and acceptance of singing sensation Frank Ocean, who has openly discussed his romantic relationships with men and women[, paired with the radio prominence of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’s “Same Love” illustrates  hip-hop’s openness towards new and unusual ideas, particularly if they are executed through music creatively and inspiringly. 
 
Kendrick Lamar’s rise to the top of the hip-hop world both shines light on the increase of unconventional rappers and serves as an example of hip-hop’s capacity for rapid change. Though hip-hop does not always get the best “rap” for creativity and originality, its capacity to accept the irregular and the progressive—whether a unique production sound, message, or voice— is exactly what makes hip-hop the most dynamic and exciting genre of popular music.

When Matt Damon spoke at Harvard via Skype this February, he didn’t come as a repressed math genius or the talented Mr. Ripley, but rather as an American in WWII set on saving pieces of art from Nazi destruction. But the movie he was promoting, “The Monuments Men”,has been struggling to gain critical acclaim. Reviewers have complained that it tries to be Goldilocks, striking a balance between funny and serious, but ultimately comes across as inauthentic.“It’s been a bit of a dance,” director George Clooney told the online media news site TheWrap. “You don’t want to do a replica [of other films], you have to do a new version.”Part of his challenge, of course, is that “The Monuments Men” is joining a conversation that has already been going on for decades. From “Schindler’s List”to “Inglourious Basterds”, it’s easy to get the feeling that all we can say about the Nazis has already been said.
Clooney isn’t the only filmmaker who has had to contend with a constellation of blockbusters. In a very different context, German cinema after WWII had to face up to the mammoth propaganda productions of the Nazi regime itself. How was it possible to make honest movies about WWII when so much of postwar life was about forgetting and moving on?
It was in response to this national mood that Alexander Kluge’s “Brutality in Stone” appeared in 1961 at Westdeutsche Kurzfilmtage, an Oberhausen film festival. Unlike earlier films, which projected simple messages of “never again,” this 12-minute short contains neither romantic heroes nor concentration camps. Instead, the viewer is confronted with over 200 spliced shots of former Nazi buildings, one after another: stairways, corners, walls ridden with bullet holes, windows shaped like arrow slits. Set against the rousing soundscape of SS mass rallies, the grand and brutal visions of the Third Reich suddenly come into sharp focus, refracted through the ruins of a failed dream.
Kluge did to Nazi history what Germans would later do to the Berlin Wall, breaking a fallen system into ever smaller shards. The emptiness audiences feel during Kluge’s film cannot easily be explained––nostalgia for the Third Reich is certainly not the way to put it––but it captures with painful clarity the kind of loss that a nation feels after a war. To compare an experimental German documentary with a 21st century-Hollywood comedy-drama seems a little unfair, but “Brutality in Stone” gives us the kind of searing honesty that “The Monuments Men” seems to miss.
Fast forward to 2009, when Quentin Tarantino's “Inglourious Basterds” hit the silver screen. By this point, “The Sound of Music,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” and “Schindler’s List” had already spent years at the top of the movie watch list. Where Kluge had to face the mammoth architectures of Nazi history, Tarantino had to film for an American mass market that was reeling, not from postwar trauma, but from an excess of good movies about Nazi history. Tense, witty, and utterly gory, his Jewish revenge fantasy plays nothing like “Brutality in Stone,” but it is still as much a historical investigation as it is a Hollywood blockbuster.
Like all Tarantino movies, “Inglourious Basterds” makes an absurd number of allusions to other films, making it impossible for the audience to fully immerse themselves in the world of Nazi Germany. Viewers are so constantly bombarded by the references to King Kong, Cinderella, and Scarface that they cannot forget that this is a film about film. It does almost everything it can within its limitations as a movie: it tells the tale of the persecuted Jew, it highlights American heroism and British ingenuity, it provides comic relief, it shoots Hitler in the face and then blows up all the Nazis. In its excess, it tells viewers outright: “I’ve already said everything there is to say about Nazi history.”
Tarantino is not responding to the legacy of WWII, but rather to its afterlife in movies. In making its limits as a film so obvious, the movie’s blatant fantasy suddenly becomes its most honest aspect. By making its historical inaccuracies so explicit, “Inglourious Basterds” reflects the film industry’s tendency to turn Nazi history into redemptive story telling.
The truth is, film can never be completely honest. Movies are meant to entertain us, to give us therapy, and to help us work through our most difficult histories, but because history cannot literally be repeated for the camera lens, they can never show us history as it really was. “Brutality in Stone”responds to the propaganda of the Third Reich by showing us its unadorned ruins. “Inglourious Basterds”takes on a whole canon of Hollywood blockbusters by mimicking them and taking them to their logical extremes. Unfortunately for Clooney, the greatest flaw of “The Monument’s Men” might just be that it’s five years late. In spinning yet another tale about American saviors rescuing civilization from the Nazis, Clooney steps on ground that has been trodden one too many times.

After nine years, British filmmaker Jonathan Glazer returns to the director’s chair for his third feature film, “Under the Skin.” Starring Scarlett Johansson, the film is an adaptation of Michel Faber’s novel of the same name, and it follows an alien in the body of an attractive woman as she travels throughout Scotland seducing men and abducting them to harvest their organs. While Glazer’s initial adaptation remained faithful to the narrative of Faber’s novel, the final film turned out drastically different, with a larger thematic focus on the gradual individuation of Johansson’s character. “In this case, the thing that was most exciting to me was that journey, that kind of existential unease of the character,” Glazer says. “And then we created a new journey, watched her journey unfold, and watched her change and drift and be almost infected by human impulse.”
 
In order to capture the rawness of our human world through an alien perspective, Glazer sought to escape the artificial qualities imposed by conventional filmmaking. “It wasn’t about a movie set. We didn’t want to create a feature film in the way you’d contrive or construct those realities,” Glazer says. Much of the film was actually filmed in secret, with Johansson driving a van around Scotland and interacting with complete strangers. To tackle the technical problems of filming these strangers without their knowledge, the production crew actually had to construct cameras that met a very unique set of specifications. “We had to build them because the cameras out there were too small,” Glazer says. “Either the ones that were small enough weren’t good enough quality, or the ones that were small enough weren’t good enough to hide, so we built our own for those purposes. We found a way of hiding them depending on the circumstances we were filming.”
 In one scene, Johansson walks down an urban street in Scotland when she suddenly falls to the ground. Although this incident was actually documented by paparazzi following the actress in December 2012 (later to be transformed into a viral Internet meme), Glazer had secret cameras filming the entire time, unbeknownst to the world. “We had three cameras positioned in the way you would if you were to have full control, precisely where you wanted them,” Glazer says. “Out of the window of somebody’s apartment, the closest camera to her was filmed through the window of a shop, and the other camera where we can see her being pulled to her feet was being filmed through a hole in a suitcase.” Glazer’s devotion to cinematic realism doesn’t end with this scene—many of the people who appear in the film weren’t cast, and even one scene at a packed nightclub was entirely filmed in secret. “[It’s] all real—there are no extras,” Glazer says. “Some people in the film are cast and some aren’t cast. And the people who were cast beforehand were cast to sort of blend in invisibly with the people who weren’t.”
 
During production, Glazer also consciously avoided blockbuster-type film scoring, instead choosing first-timer Mica Levi of the British avant-pop band Micachu & The Shapes to compose for the film. “Sometimes music is used to kind of prop something up or manipulate an emotion or be there in place of one, and often a film score can be used to manipulate someone in ways that are forced. And I think that what we tried to do here was to really create the character’s voice,” Glazer says. “There’s very little [dialogue]. The music’s very simple [yet] very sophisticated.” According to the director, three themes really dominate the film: an “alien loop” embodying the character’s initial hive mind, a “perfume” that appears when she captures her victims, and a final “burgeoning consciousness” in the film’s third act. “The music of the film is the blood of it, really,” Glazer says.
 
Perhaps most prominently, music reflects Johansson’s character’s state of mind during a sex scene where she discovers the sexuality of her human body. “The music that Mica wrote for the love scene…is kind of deluded, this abuseful [sic] love. And it’s twisted and it’s searching,” Glazer says. Although sex plays a prominent role in the plot, the film manages to bring a unique sense of innocence and purity to even the scenes where Johansson appears fully nude. “By trying to position the nudity and sexuality of the film and make it more of a study, the camera is not excited by the nudity,” Glazer says. “Her nudity is about anatomy and the body as a craft, and the idea of looking at her body as this new craft and de-eroticizing it in the way that she looks at it.”
 
By emphasizing the individuation of Johansson’s character, Glazer aims to ultimately make a profound statement about human notions of identity. In the film, all of the human men are harvested for their organs and discarded, while Johansson’s character and the other aliens are indecipherable entities with unspoken, mysterious motives. “All of [the mens’] insides are removed—we thought of the skin in the film as a kind of shopping bag, and the contents of the shopping bag were the things that this entity were interested in,” says Glazer. “The skin, the thing that we hold so much store by and scrutinize and judge, for them is just a plastic bag to be discarded.”

Historians have myriad theories regarding Western cultural cycles and repetition of history, if such a thing exists; many believe that every 40 years, certain patterns restart themselves. Thus, about two laps around the track would take us from the 1880s, when Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Patience; or, Bunthorne’s Bride” debuted in London, to the 1970s, when the Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players cleverly set their current production. Joey S.C. Goodknight, a graduate student at SEAS, who plays poser poet Bunthorne, imbues his impeccable Received Pronunciation, the style of upper-class British elocution that is traditionally used in G&S productions, with a hint of psychedelic “Big Lebowski” awe as he reads out of his college-ruled poetry notebook. With minimal script alteration, the plot transfers perfectly. The poets obsessed with “aesthetics,” the returning soldiers, from Vietnam, of course, and the group of adoring female groupies all fit perfectly into the sunny scenery where director Matthew W.G. Walker ’16 sets the farce. While Goodknight and the other graduate students in “Patience; or, Bunthorne’s Bride” find the balance between 1970s referentiality and adherence to the source material far more consistently than their undergraduate counterparts, the inherent effectiveness of the setting and the dynamic energy of most of the cast partially salvage the production’s technical failings.
 
The graduate students, Bunthorne’s rival poet Grosvenor (Zachary P. Mallory, a student at the Boston Conservatory) and the Colonel of the returning soldiers (Benjamin T. Morris ’09, a student at GSAS), offer uproarious and musically gorgeous performances. Morris fashions a twangy Southern accent and sings in a pretty baritone as he and his soldiers compete with the aesthetes for the love of the groupies. Malloy has an immensely powerful baritone voice that is both operatic and clear—he is on a different vocal level from anyone else in the production and impressively counters his louder moments of bravado with tender softness and control. His acting is some of the funniest in the production, as he fashions his poet into a rollicking and flamboyant Robert Goulet lookalike in contrast to the tripped-out Goodknight. However, as the duo battles for the affections of the most elusive groupie, the naïve and romantically inexperienced Patience, their differing personae begin to blur. Part of this coagulation is scripted, but the concerted character work effectively drives the point home. When the two share the stage, their contrasting energies and their rapport are riveting. 
The undergraduate students have a more difficult time owning the stage with the same level of gusto. Claudia D. Oh ’17, who plays Patience, expresses a relatively limited range of emotion. While Oh captures the scripted cluelessness of her character, she does not counter her denseness with enough manic energy or excitement. She seemingly conflates her character’s intellectual narrowness with shallow feelings. While the resultant blandness allows her to act as a necessary straight man in a play of domineering personalities, she seems too relaxed and level-headed in moments that should be truly madcap. Oh’s singing voice has an effortless higher register and an appropriately quick vibrato for her sudden jumps in pitch. Unfortunately, many of her words get lost in the shuffle during the songs. Whether this is an issue of an overbearing orchestra or a legitimate diction problem for Oh is unclear. Had Oh injected more gravitas into her role, however, crisper words would have almost assuredly followed. As a result, Patience’s reluctant engagement to Bunthorne and tortured love for Grosvenor do not pack the punch that they should.
 
The colorful supporting cast, which includes the dowdy Lady Jane (Laura A. Peterson ’16), eventually the sole remaining follower of the pathetic Bunthorne, and the “Duke” of the soldiers (Alexandra C. Tartaglia ’17) are reliable additions to the cast. Peterson offers the right amount of desperation and self-deprecation to her role, warbling about her unconditional love for Bunthorne and convincingly appearing as a comforting matriarch to her coterie of younger women. Tartaglia has one of the most of pleasing voices in the cast and delivers a high-energy performance. While not especially convincing as a man—she’s a soprano and doesn’t try to put much stereotypically masculine affectation into her spoken lines—she still works within the group of soldiers. None of the secondary characters manage to capture both the classic G&S trappings and the ’60s archetypes that Goodknight and Malloy master. Some slip into Received Pronunciation while singing but speak in contemporary American accents, while others eschew modernity altogether and give classic British performances. The inconsistencies here distract from and damage the believability of the production.
 
The orchestra and chorus are mostly musically strong thanks to music director, Jacob Moscona-Skolnik ’16. The only glaring exception is the violins, which can’t keep up with the fast tempi and are almost always out of tune. The chorus, made up of the additional soldiers and groupies, offers a vocally clean and theatrically enthusiastic collective performance. Walker gives them plenty to do, crafting plenty of gags involving flowers and tie-dye to further solidify the whimsical tone. Movement director Talia K. Rothstein ’17 also makes the most of the chorus’s talents, creating eye-catching courtship dances and frenetic entrances and exits. The overall impression of “Patience; or Bunthorne’s Bride” is certainly lacking in polish and relies too squarely on the brilliance of its graduate students, but it is still a zany and usually entertaining reimagining of Gilbert and Sullivan lore.

Todd Terje’s choice for the name of his new album, “It’s Album Time,” could be interpreted in a few ways. For one, it’s bold and attention-grabbing, offering no thematic or tonal hints; it’s eccentric and a bit confusing for the same reason, and could also come across as stale or just plain lazy. For all of those reasons, it’s also a fitting title for the Norwegian producer’s debut album, which strangely manages to both intrigue and bore throughout its 12 tracks as Terje meshes electronic and disco to create a spacey, jazzy, and almost purely atmospheric sound, albeit one that tends to lack cohesion.
 
Each individual track starts off similarly and in the vein of electronic disco; short, pulsing hooks permeate the album predictably, but Terje often crafts them into echoing, twinkling patterns that sound like samples from an archetypal space shuttle’s control panel, such as on “Intro (It’s Album Time)” and “Alfonso Muskedunder.” Eventually, the more classic dance elements are built into the tracks, resulting in a new and refreshed sound, neither disco nor space-rock, that would have maintained its appeal had it been more consistent throughout the album. It’s unexpected to have that kind of mixed environmental evocation from an artist who collaborated with pop-rock classics like Franz Ferdinand and Robbie Williams, and it’s a pleasant twist on nu-disco that still maintains a danceable character.
 
The problem is that “It’s Album Time” offers an entire collection of such interpretations of dance and disco music that it’s difficult to pay attention to how they come together. “Svensk Sås” would be at home in a Brazilian bar, combining a fiery, jumpy piano hook, a smooth horn part and a cheerful bopping chorus into a track that sounds far more like something off my parents’ old cassettes than a club playlist. “Leisure Suit Preben” similarly falls into the category of easy listening, with an unadventurous piano part that seems excerpted from a student jazz improvisation group. But “Johnny and Mary,” the only track on the album with intelligible lyrics, is a brooding, stripped-down meditation on miscommunication that has nothing close to a counterpart anywhere else on “It’s Album Time.” As glam-rock star Bryan Ferry drawls out in a low croon, “Johnny’s always running around / Trying to find certainty / He needs all the world to confirm / That he ain’t lonely,” a slow, thumping bass beat is accompanied primarily by resonating finger snaps that only emphasize the empty space that characterizes most of the track.
 
It’s a finely tuned and affecting song, but almost too emotive on an album that is otherwise inhabited by grinding synth and catchy dance rhythms. The closer, “Inspector Norse,” is a seven-minute toe-tapper that could easily be a high-schooler’s summer anthem, an ebullient swirl of energetic production and softened percussion. Unfortunately, the synth isn’t used to equal effect on tracks like “Swing Star (Part 1)” or its unexpected follower, “Swing Star (Part 2).” Here, it builds in insistence until the track is overwhelmed by grating effects that almost cross the threshold of abrasiveness, distracting from the sweetly retro disco beats that would otherwise make for two cheerful homages to dance floors from the ’70s.
 The album is an extended tale of that same sentiment of “if only.” If only Terje had been more comfortable with limiting his aesthetic exploration, if only he had focused on the album’s sound rather than that of each individual track, if only he hadn’t added an army of extra elements to what is ostensibly a study in nu-disco, maybe the result wouldn’t have been an album that, despite its title, sounds more like a thrown-together mixtape.

The word "quilting" tends to bring to mind grandmothers and dusty floral prints, yet it is precisely that image the Museum of Fine Arts is seeking to dispel with "Quilts and Color: The Pilgrim/Roy Collection," a new exhibit opening April 6. The exhibit focuses on color theory and abstraction, pairing intricate quilts in riotous colors with the works of 20th-century modernist painters. The result is a beautifully vibrant presentation that makes the art of quilting accessible, compelling, and even—dare we say it—cool.
 
The exhibit is drawn from the shared collection of artists Gerald Roy and the late Paul Pilgrim, who met at college in California in the 1960s. The two were among the first to recognize quilts as art, and their collection today contains over 3,000 items, about 1,200 of which are finished quilts.
 
Despite the plethora of options before them, MFA curators and Roy did their best to avoid selecting an overwhelming number of works for the exhibit. The 58 carefully chosen pieces are divided into eight groupings, most centered on a different aspect of color theory. The first room focuses on vibration, the phenomenon resulting from the juxtaposition of complementary colors of equal intensity. Each section is accompanied by a modern work or set of works, including art by Josef Albers, Victor Vasarely, and Sol LeWitt. The paintings and prints are meant to illustrate the unifying principle of each section, yet they also point to the larger cultural relevance of the quilts on display.
 
The accompanying works are considered to be at the forefront of modern color theory, yet the quilts they hang beside made use of the same principles often a full hundred years earlier. They were avant-garde before there was avant-garde: the makers' skill and intuitive understanding of color relations is reflected in a unique and remarkable fashion.
 
Why has it taken so long for these quilts to finally be recognized as works of art? Roy believes the answer lies in remaining traces of bias in the art world; quilts were (and remain) taken less seriously because they are domestic objects traditionally made by women. He hopes that the exhibit will be a major step towards the recognition of quilts as being on par with drawing, painting, and other, conventional art forms. It might sound like a lofty goal, but the MFA has devoted enough time, energy, and thought (as well as over 10,000 square feet of gallery space) that it just might work.

As I wrote in my last column, Twitter has existed for over eight years, and in that span of time the microblogging site has accrued a user base that consists of everyone and his mother. Having spent a substantial amount of time on the social media platform for this column and to promote my own #brand, I’ve noticed that most users can be sorted into just a few select categories.
 
The Celebrity: Ashton Kutcher famously beat out CNN in 2009, becoming the owner of the first Twitter account to one million followers. But today it seems as if every celebrity controls a stake in the Twittersphere, and one million followers is a mere starting point rather than a far-off aspiration.
 
Some stars take advantage of their online presence in order to shamelessly plug their next project,
while others connect to fans in a more authentic way by allowing us a peek inside their minds.
 
These accounts are generally not brimming with material that is insightful, profound, or in any way consequential, but they do tend to gain the most traction.
 
 Examples:
 @SHAQ 
 @BritneySpears 
 @JTimberlake 
 
The News Outlet: One of the more valuable and practical aspects of Twitter, news-based accounts provide their followers with up-to-the-minute information regarding current events, faster than any other medium of news dissemination. Although the hacking of these accounts can incite fear and panic among Twitter users everywhere, they provide millions of Twitter users with free and extensive knowledge at a moment’s notice.
 
 Examples: 
 @CNNbrk 
 @AP 
 @SportsCenter 
 
The Internet Junk Account: Essentially the Twitter-equivalent of Buzzfeed or Upworthy, these accounts lure unsuspecting Internet users in with ostensibly captivating brand names like @GoogleTips or @EmrgencyKittens and you’re like “Cool! I want to learn some neat tricks about Google and/or enjoy pictures of kittens!” But no. You will learn nothing about Google and enjoy no kittens. Instead, these accounts simply retweet advertisements and post ambiguous “pic.twltter” links that look like they belong but very much do not. False advertising. Unfollowed.
 
 Examples: 
@UberFacts 
@BestInventions 
@LifeProTips
 
The Corporate Account: Following the advent of Twitter, it was only a matter of time before companies clambered aboard in an effort to bolster their online presence. Corporate accounts promote products, respond to customer concerns, and conduct surveys. Although some of these accounts are among the driest on the site, 
 
others have progressed past sheer advertising to construct a compelling online persona. 
 
 
 Examples: 
 @OldSpice 
 @McDonalds 
 @SamsungMobile 
 
The Lurker: This user spends the majority of their time on Twitter following other people, refraining from publishing any content themselves. You most likely won’t see much of this person, but they do constitute approximately 40 percent of the site’s user base, 35 percent of whom are probably overprotective mothers “keeping tabs” on their children.  
The Middle Aged Businessman: This user joined Twitter after one of his colleagues invited him via InMail, or following he attended a Business and Technology Leadership Conference at his local Sheraton. The majority of his tweets sound something like this: “Productive meeting on the golf course today with @SoAndSo discussing the role of Extension Strategies in future success. @SoAndSo needs to hit the driving range! L.O.L.” or “Excited to learn about #MarketingSegmentation at #ICRM2014”  
 
Unless this person is indirectly paying for your child’s college education, there’s no need to follow him.
The Entertainer: With such a low barrier to entry, Twitter provides all its users an opportunity to try their hand at stand up comedy. They “notice things”
 and they “hate it when”
 and “isn’t it funny?”
 
Luckily for us. professional comedians are also online, and they are genuinely funny. Twitter provides them the opportunity to test out new material, try out different styles, and add new supporters.
 
Comedian @RobDelaney’s stand-up and writing career took off after being voted “Funniest Person on Twitter,” although he would most likely fall in the next category. 
 
 Examples:
 @DemetriMartin 
 @LouisCK 
 @JohnMulaney 
 
The Weird Entertainer: Similar to the aforementioned Entertainer, the objective of the Weird Entertainer is also to elicit laughter, but these comics have devised a new approach to humor. Instead of adhering to the traditional joke structure, with setup and punch line, the Weird Entertainer tweets legitimately bizarre and outlandish things, in the hopes of catching his audience off guard. It’s not for everyone.
 
 Examples:
 @RobDelaney 
 @degg 
 @dril 
 
The Bro: This user is most likely in college or high school with a few college friends, and much of his original content concerns his excessive consumption of alcohol, lost phone/wallet/keys, or infatuation with Jordan Belfort. Everyday occurrences are legendary, and they always “be on their grind.” That being said, approximately 95 percent of his total contribution to public discourse lies in his retweeting of Total Frat Move and tagging his frat buddy, alerting followers of a potential inside joke among frat brothers.  
 
 Examples:
 @TotalFratMove 
 @Frat_Star 
 @LifeAsBros 
 
Strict Adherer to Internet Days: Moments after the onset of hashtags, someone elected to establish themed days (#ss, #mcm, #tt, #wcw, #tbt, #fbf), providing Internet users with an insurance policy in the event they were unable to produce anything original on any given day. Casual users will maybe post a #tbt every other week and the occasional Woman Crush Wednesday if their significant other asks them why they haven’t yet. But certain users observe these guidelines with more fervor and resolve than they do the law, and believe they are on a mission from God complete the task week in and week out, not just on Twitter, but on Instagram and Facebook as well.  
 
Which of these groupings is most desirable? It differs from person to person. But I’m pretty sure we can accurately pinpoint the worst:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The other day, I headed over to one of our fine dining halls for dinner (I won’t specify which one, although it rhymes with Schmincy) and wound up chatting with an old friend and his two roommates. Conversation quickly turned to business. Between the four of us, we’ve got three start-ups. Three! For perspective, three is more than the number of rings LeBron has. Three is more than the number of times Justin Bieber has been arrested (as of the time of this writing). Three is almost one quarter of the number of people who voted in the last UC election.
 
And that was the fourth conversation I had that day about start-ups. The fourth! Now I’m not going to go off on some sort of stupid tangent about the number four just to boost my word count. My point, more broadly, is that everyone and his grandmother is working on some sort of start-up. I can hardly go to the bathroom without running into another entrepreneur. It’s a real problem: the greater Boston area has the fourth-highest number of start-ups per capita in the United States, and sometimes I just want to relieve myself in peace, blissfully unaware of the next Airbnb for pet Chihuahuas.
 
Some of these folks, mind you, are literally building the future, or at least the next generation of really cool gizmos and gadgets. One gentleman I spoke to is working on a ball that has embedded video and sensors, so policemen and first responders can scope out a potentially deadly setting without physically entering it. Another is developing a platform to teach coding to young children. These people, though, are not the only ones starting companies. Others are super-gluing step-counters to bracelets and calling it high-tech. (Yes, I made up that example, but if you run with that idea I expect royalty checks.)
 
But there I was, sitting in the dining hall talking about the next social networking tool for high school students. The chatter focused mostly on the user base. The app is growing by the day, I am told. It’s going viral. Huge, massive. Already in sixteen states. Haven’t I heard? Facebook will be out, done, kaput in three, four, maybe five years, and this just might help nail the coffin.
 
But how to monetize? There isn’t much of a successful business model for making money off social apps, unless your name is Winklevoss, in which case lawsuits work quite nicely. Advertising revenue, hosted events, and sponsored content barely amount to much more than peanuts. And that is the strategy for 90 percent of apps—there is no way to make much money except to sell for dollars on the penny. The app may be idiotic, or it may be brilliant, but it probably can’t cash in until the big sale.
 
And so we discussed valuations. How do investors measure the worth of a company? By taking the potential revenue? By counting the active users? By measuring the terabytes of personal user information? Regardless, I am told, my new friend’s company will be worth tens of millions, minimum. Potentially much more than that. The sky’s the limit, as long as some investor has money sloshing around to sink into a social media app for high schoolers.
 
But we’re past high school, and onto college, and if somebody gets really lucky, dropping out. Because the startup community here is quite a sight to behold. You could be sitting next to the next CEO of a future Fortune 500 company as you read this. Unless, of course, you are reading this alone in your room, in which case you should probably either get back to the homework you’re supposed to be doing or try to make some friends. Regardless, make a trip to Harvard’s Innovation Lab. Talk to some entrepreneurs. There are so many incredible people to meet and projects to check out.
 
Just don’t expect me to do the same. I’m too busy starting a company.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Dear Anonymous:
Harvard doesn’t “win” unless and until it protects its students from sexual assault. As Harvard strives to “do better” in response to your article and the Harvard “Can Do Better” campaign, my hope is that we can transcend a conception of the university and sexual-assault victims as opposed parties.  Harvard wins only if students in your position are treated with dignity, respect, compassion and above all, fairness.
Colleges and universities across the country are currently struggling to determine how best to fulfill their legal and moral obligations to prevent and address sexual assault. The issue has reached a tipping point:  President Obama recently appointed a White House Task Force on Protecting Students from Sexual Assault; the federal Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act (Campus SaVE Act) recently went into effect; and over 40 federal civil-rights complaints filed by students are currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education. 
Sexual assault on campus, we are coming to realize, is not merely a matter of isolated criminal behavior; it is also a civil-rights issue. Sexual harassment in an educational context, like sexual harassment in the workplace, abridges the civil right to be free from a hostile environment.  Sexual assault is a particularly severe form of sexual harassment; its presence has been recognized to constitute a hostile environment under Title IX.
To prevent or eliminate a hostile environment of this sort, schools are legally obliged to do three things.  First, they must provide educational programs aimed at preventing rape. Second, they must provide academic accommodations and support to enable survivors of sexual assaults to stay in school and retain equal access to educational opportunities. Third, schools must investigate promptly and remediate equitably any claims of sexual assault. 
Regrettably, some administrators continue to shirk their responsibilities.  The president of the University of Connecticut, recently under the media spotlight after seven students filed a federal civil rights complaint, stated that, “no president or police chief can prevent all [sexual assaults], and we should never, ever be so naive to think so.”  This is an unhelpful posture.  Granted, schools might not be able to prevent all “first rapes.”  But schools can and must reduce their frequency.  Equally important, schools can and must eliminate altogether what has come to be known as “second rapes.”  That phrase refers to the experience of degradation and betrayal that rape survivors encounter when they come forward seeking justice. Your description, as well as the stories told by countless other student survivors with whom I have worked through the years, analogizes the treatment by school administrators, to being assaulted a second time – suffering anew the senses of being helpless, hopeless, neither heard nor taken seriously. 
As an academic who has developed legal policy on Title IX and campus sexual assault for a decade, my principal advice to Harvard and to all schools is this:  in responding to any report of sexual violence you must avoid subjecting the student to a second rape.  Strive to reduce, rather than exacerbate, the trauma the student is experiencing from the assault.  Bear constantly in mind that how you treat her or him will determine whether she or he will be able to continue her or his studies, whether she or he will recover or will spiral downward – and, finally, whether she or he becomes a complainant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit against the school.  Among the implications of this general principle:  receive the information with gentle hands; do not blame the reporting student for the assault; do not force her or him to retell the story repeatedly; and provide academic accommodations that include one specific person assigned to coordinate the student’s needs so that she or he is not left alone to navigate the traumatic effects that often emerge in the wake of an assault. 
Schools can prevent the “second rape” through thoughtful implementation of their responsibilities regarding accommodations and investigations. Academic accommodations include addressing the aspects of the student’s life that will enable her or him to stay in school with a feeling of safety and support.  Living situations are of paramount importance to a victim’s sense of safety.  Leaving a student in the same house as her alleged assailant may subject her to possible re-traumatization at every encounter with the accused, predictably interfering with her ability to concentrate on her studies. Moreover, the Department of Education counsels specifically that removing a reporting student from her housing arrangement should not necessarily be the indicated response; changes in the accused’s housing should be considered as well.  This should not be surprising.  Why should a survivor be further burdened by being forced to move, after being victimized by another student’s misconduct?
Finally, schools are required to conduct a thorough investigation into any allegation of sexual misconduct and are prohibited from discouraging a student from pursuing a complaint.   Again, this should not be surprising.  How can a school determine what charges (if any) are appropriate if they do not conduct such an investigation? If a complainant wishes to remain confidential, the investigation might be limited.  But if the victim wants to move forward, a full investigation must ensue. The newly enacted Campus SaVE Act requires that a school’s investigation and resolution of a complaint be animated by victim safety and accountability. It is critical to remember here that it is a civil right violation being investigated, even though the underlying violation might also be a crime.  This makes it much easier for schools to sanction gender-based discrimination and eliminate a sexually hostile environment on campus.
Anonymous, your story has already resonated with so many others across the country. One student survivor with whom I met yesterday saw your article and told me she could have written it herself. You are using your voice. It contributes to a national chorus of students stepping up to demand their rights to an education free of gender violence and sex discrimination. Thank you for speaking up.  We hear you. 
Diane L. Rosenfeld is a Lecturer on Law and the Director of the Gender Violence Program at the Harvard Law School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Early last month, Harvard President Drew Faust wrote an open letter to the Harvard community about proposals that Harvard divest from fossil fuel companies. In a decision with which we strongly disagree, President Faust wrote that she and the members of Harvard’s governing board “do not believe that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise.”
 
We will discuss why the opposite conclusion would be both “warranted and wise,” but first we will lament the absolutism of the President’s statement and policy, which left no room for even gradual progress towards divestment. While we recognize that most investment portfolios like Harvard’s include a variety of investments—including hedge funds, mutual funds, and more—thus leaving few opportunities to pick or choose from a menu of specific stocks, over time Harvard should move aggressively toward investments that do not include fossil fuels. Any hope of holding the globe to a two-degree Celsius increase in temperature—a target agreed upon by 141 nations, and the importance of which is reiterated in the most recent IPCC report—requires that 80 percent of the world’s proven fossil reserves stay in the ground. The fact that these reserves are currently carried on the balance sheet of publicly traded fossil fuels companies strongly supports the argument for an investment strategy that transitions away from these companies.
 
President Faust switches to a different argument when she says that the issue of divestment is an issue of politicizing investment decisions. While we agree that Harvard should not use its endowment to further narrow, one-sided, self-interested political ends, we reject the notion that there is anything “political” about climate change.  Over 97 percent of climate scientists, led by many of Faust’s own faculty, have agreed that anthropogenic climate change is a scientific reality. Climate change is not a political issue; it is a moral reality.
 
Faust seems to argue that Harvard’s investment decisions should never be influenced by considerations other than maximizing return. There is a deeper issue here, which is that of whether a mission-driven educational institution can ignore its own core values in making investment decisions without damaging its ability to achieve that mission to educate. We all understand the importance of teaching by example. Students learn from the culture and the behavior of an institution and its leaders as much as they learn from classes. Presumably Harvard would not argue that its values have no bearing on its hiring or compensation policies. Why is investment different?
 
In the past, Harvard has decided to divest from companies engaged in the manufacture of tobacco products, as well as certain companies involved in oil production activities with the government of Sudan, which had been found to be engaging in genocide. In other words, Harvard has decided that the values of the institution were irreconcilable with holding those particular investments. There is no greater moral challenge facing our society today than that of climate change. If we remain on our current path, the wealthy world’s fossil fuel consumption will place hundreds of millions of mostly poorer people in harm’s way, and will leave our children faced with a future characterized not by possibility and opportunity but instead by the need to manage the horrendous impacts of climate change. If ever there was a moral challenge facing our society, this is it.
 
A third point President Faust makes is that the University should use its voice and power not to ostracize fossil fuel companies but to engage these companies in constructive dialogue. This statement sounds reasonable, but it ignores the reality that the fossil fuel industry as a whole has spent hundreds of millions of dollars corrupting our political system to ensure that it does not have to operate on a level playing field. The industry has also spent money manufacturing and spreading doubt among the American public about the very climate science being produced by institutions like Harvard—all at the cost of the poorest around the world, and of our children and grandchildren’s future.
 
Rather than reject the notion that Harvard’s investment decisions could and should be used to influence the fossil fuel industry’s practices, why not take advantage of Harvard’s community of scholars to develop a set of principles which would constructively guide Harvard’s investments related to fossil fuels? These principles, for example, could include divestment from companies that are actively supporting a sinister campaign to spread doubt about climate science or companies engaged in the most polluting practices.
 
Harvard University is the most famous academic institution in the world and, as such, is watched by everyone. President Faust would do well to reopen discussions with students and alumni regarding divestment, explore common ground, and make Harvard a leader in developing responsible investment policies that are consistent with meeting the challenges of climate change, the greatest moral threat of our time.

Since the implementation of the current General Education program at Harvard in 2007, the program's structure and course offerings have been the subject of praise, criticism, and at times, national fascination. Last week, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences announced that a formal committee will be created to assess the progress and success of the Program in General Education— the first of its kind for the current curriculum.
 
Chair of the Philosophy Department Sean D. Kelly will head the committee, and its evaluation of the General Education program will rely significantly on students' responses to survey questions about the curriculum, though the committee itself will be composed of only faculty members from several departments.
 
Though expanding the committee to include students may be unfeasible granted the timeline of the evaluation, we hope that the committee will seek as much student input as possible into its assessment. This may entail more than simply surveys, which are regularly plagued by low response rates. Inviting students to participate in committee deliberations and incentivizing students to complete surveys earnestly— in a fashion similar to how the Q guide offers the early ability to see grades— ought to become part of the committee's toolkit.
 
Many students dislike the current General Education program. Its admirable goal of seeking to "connect in an explicit way what students learn in Harvard classrooms to life outside the ivied walls" has instead produced a small number of classes glutted with students and often seen as the easiest courses at the University.
 
It is logical that General Education courses in the physical or life sciences, for example, be less rigorous than those offered within specific science departments. However, students in some departments find themselves having to take lower level courses in their fields of expertise simply to fulfill their General Education requirements. Social Studies 10a, for example, does not fulfill the Ethical Reasoning requirement, most English department lecture and seminar courses do not fulfill Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding requirements, graduate level Mathematics courses do not fulfill the Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement, and so on.
 
The most immediate and easily solvable problem facing the Gen Ed program rests with the scope of classes that fulfill requirements. The current system requires professors to fill out proposal forms for their courses to be evaluated for submission into the Gen Ed program. This process ought to still exist, but the committee should immediately increase the program's purview by admitting courses that obviously introduce students to the the Gen Ed fields.
 
General Education courses ought not to differ significantly in style or rigor from other courses at the university. Such a reorganization may help solve the issue of overenrolled Gen Ed courses, even if it requires a reevaluation or elimination of some of the Program in General Education's current principles.

Richard A. Slone has never missed a lecture by Shaye J.D. Cohen, Littauer Professor of Hebrew Literature and Philosophy. Like certain unnamed students in Cohen’s Culture and Belief course, he doesn’t make it to 10 a.m. class. He knows that they are taped. However, unlike most of the students in the class, he listens to them on his bike as he trains for triathlons. Also, he’s “semi-retired,” which I guess most of us aren’t.
Slone is the grandfather of Josh A. Goldstein (FM staff writer), and one of thousands of people outside of Harvard who listen to Cohen’s lectures remotely, either on Harvard iSites or on iTunesU. Though Goldstein was enrolled in one of Cohen’s courses last semester when his grandfather began to follow along, Slone has not yet had his fill of Cohen’s expertise on Judaic history. He continues to watch Cohen’s spring set of lectures—Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism, From the Old Testament to Christianity.” He listens to the videos, racking up his data usage, while pedalling along and occasionally emailing Cohen questions.
He calls me from Boca Raton, Fla., eager to talk about what he deems “one of the best courses he has ever taken.” And he has taken a lot. After graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University, he went to both law school and business school. He is a self-described “make-believe modern Biblical scholar.”  Perfect, perhaps, for my study group. I, along with over 400 other undergraduates, am enrolled in the course.
“So you listen to every lecture?” I ask.
“I listen to every one of them.” I am impressed; this is more than my roommate, also enrolled in the course, has ever attended. But does he do the reading?
“Now listen,” he continues, “Kugel, I read Kugel’s book. Now, you know he references Kugel in some of the lectures, right?”
“Uh, yeah.” I did not.
“I read the entire Kugel book,” he said.
However, as he tells me multiple times, it is very difficult to take notes while riding a bike. He has no notes from the Friday lecture.
“I was hoping that you would be taking notes.” I try one last time.
“I don’t have any notes to give you, I’m sorry.”
As it turns out, Slone has not taken the course to provide a study aid for his grandson (or other unnamed FM staff). Rather, he took the course as a way to stay active in Goldstein’s life. “My feeling is that when [students] go off to college, there is a tendency to lose touch, parents and grandparents get shucked to the side,” he said.
“I’m not a support system for them.” he says, but he does like to bounce ideas around with them and talk about the material. He even offers to discuss biblical interpretation with me.
“No, it’s fine,” I say, “maybe another time.” Instead, I give him my father’s email. My dad, for the record, is also watching the courses online.

More than 100 people gathered Thursday to hear varying perspectives on nuclear warfare and democracy based on English professor Elaine Scarry’s new book, “Thermonuclear Monarchy: Choosing Between Democracy and Doom.”
Scarry opened the talk in Tsai Auditorium the same way she opens her book, with a thought experiment.
“Imagine that there one day came to exist on earth—sometime in the future—a solitary country with a new technology.” This technology is waht Scarry calls an “out-of-ratio” weapon, meaning that it gives a small number of people the power to annihilate large numbers of people and include nuclear, biological, and other weapons of mass destruction.
According to Scarry, these weapons are monarchic rather than democratic.
“Two provisions of the United States Constitution are radically incompatible with nuclear weapons,” Scarry wrote in her book.
She proceeded to discuss the ways in which the constitutional requirement for a Congressional declaration of war and the Second Amendment support the notion that control of “out-of-ratio” weapons should not be left to a small subset of the populace.
The panel was hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center and featured Scarry, Columbia professor Philip C. Bobbitt, and Law School professor Charles Fried, with Director of the Mahindra Humanities Center Homi K. Bhabha acting as moderator.
Bobbitt and Fried, who questioned several aspects of Scarry’s work, discussed its legal arguments at length.
“It is unusual, dense with legal texts, precedence, reasoning,” said Fried about the book. However, he said that though “there are powerful moments of rhetoric and evocation” in Scarry’s book, it does not make a convincing legal argument.
One of the points that Bobbitt addressed is the difference between Congressional declarations of war and joint resolutions. He said that if Scarry wants to convince people who are not already persuaded, like himself, then some of these technical questions need to be handled more carefully.
According to the New York Times, Scarry has worked on the subject of “Thermonuclear Monarchy” for 28 years.
“It is very important that we, all of us in the University community, study injuries of the past and contemplate and marvel over how no one tried to stop them. But they can’t be undone,” Scarry said. “The only ones that can be undone are the ones that haven’t yet happened.”
Bobbitt said that despite disagreements on the topic, he feels that everyone can agree that these are terrible weapons that have the power to inflict awful destruction.
“The question is, what is the surest way to protect not just our people, but the people of the earth?” he said.

Projects winning this year’s I3 Harvard College Innovation Challenge, which were announced Thursday night following a showcase, ranged from a cake-baking device to an online platform that addresses the polarization of Congress.
Now in its seventh iteration, the entrepreneurship contest attracted 80 student teams, a 20 percent increase from last year.
Sponsored by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the Technology and Entrepreneurship Center at Harvard, and Harvard Student Agencies, I3 offers student innovators the opportunity to receive feedback and mentorship from professional entrepreneurs while competing for monetary awards.
John C. McCallum ’16, co-founder of Spray Cake and winner of the $10,000 technology startup prize, said that his venture started last year in the popular class Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science” and continued this year in Engineering Sciences 95r: “Startup R&D,” an innovation class. According to McCallum, I3 enabled Spray Cake to become “a solid and prepared business.”
Similarly, Jonathan A. Marks ’15, whose project won the $10,000 McKinley Family Grant for Social Enterprise, said that the contest required him to “answer a lot of questions” about his venture, which he said was “very helpful.” Marks co-founded Quorum, an online platform that allows its users to analyze and predict the factors that lead to bipartisan political success.
“We’re bringing big data analysis to politics,” he said.
The other two winning projects, which were both awarded $10,000, were HuePick, a device that enables restaurants and patrons with food allergies to test their food in a matter of seconds, and RapidSOS, a platform which allows people in emergencies to communicate with dispatchers quickly and reliably.
According to I3 co-president Homan Mohammadi ’14, this year’s substantial increase in participation can be attributed both to a simplified format and to Harvard students’ growing interest in entrepreneurship.
“One of the great things is that it’s not just a contest, it’s really an educational experience for all the students,” said Marcus Z. Comiter ’14, who chairs the I3 with Mohammadi. “Every year after you submit an application you get mentorship, you get advice and feedback from judges, and I think that really has given the competition a great reputation on campus.”
Paul B. Bottino, I3’s founder and executive director, said that the winning teams are usually able to take their ventures to incubator spaces around the country, where they keep developing them.
In addition to the four teams who won the $10,000 awards, three teams received an honorable mention, which came with a $1,000 grant.
The teams that do not win monetary awards also benefit from participation in the contest. According to Mohammadi, the participants take advantage of the mentorship they receive at I3 to turn their projects into real companies.
[The participating teams] are able to quickly scale up their projects much faster than if they had done it alone,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday, Joshua Kantor will take the day off from work. Instead of heading to Harvard, where he works as a part-time librarian assistant, Kantor will be starting the year at his other job: playing the organ for Boston’s beloved baseball team, the Red Sox.
Kantor has played for the current World Series championship team since 2003, and Friday is the first home game of the season. Early in the morning, he will walk the two miles from his house to Fenway Park to begin playing by the time the gates open for fans. Monday morning, Kantor will be back at Loeb Music Library, only to return to the stadium in the evening for another home game—a routine he will continue until the end of the season.
While many struggle to find the perfect work-life balance, Kantor, through his unconventional lifestyle, manages to bridge the gap between work and play on a daily basis.
JOURNEY TO FENWAY
Kantor, a talented musician and lifelong baseball fan, landed his dream job in 2003.
According to Kantor, he has been a self-proclaimed “baseball nut” since he was a child, first supporting the Atlanta Braves, then shifting allegiance to the Chicago White Sox during high school.
When he was 17, Kantor moved to Boston, and within his first week, he attended his first Red Sox game, where he witnessed the Red Sox beat the New York Yankees, 15-1. From that moment on, Kantor said, he has been a “diehard Red Sox fan.”
Similarly, he has had a passion for music from a young age. Aside from the organ, Kantor plays the piano, upright bass, guitar, and accordion.
Yet for many years before coming to Fenway, his primary job had little to do with music. After graduating from Brandeis University in 1994, Kantor worked as a librarian at Boston University’s law school for four years. In 1999, Kantor picked up a position at Harvard Law School’s library, serving as a reference and interlibrary loan assistant.
While working at the Law School, Kantor says he particularly enjoyed the one-on-one interactions he had with faculty, students, and members of outside groups when helping them locate sources.
Kyle Courtney, who worked with Kantor at the Law School, said Kantor “took real pride” in his work.
“He was on top of everything all the time,” said Courtney, who is now the copyright advisor in Harvard's Office for Scholarly Communication. “His knowledge combined with his skills was amazing.”
After almost a decade working at university libraries, Kantor was presented with an opportunity to unite his passions for music and baseball—while keeping the library job he loved.
At the encouragement of a friend who worked at the Red Sox, Kantor auditioned in 2003 to serve as the team’s organist. At the end of his second audition, Kantor was offered the position, one that he immediately accepted and has fulfilled ever since.
Kantor said he was ecstatic when he received the offer.
“[Playing] at my favorite stadium, for my favorite team, and in sort of a high-profile setting where you know there’s millions of people that come to the park every year,…it’s really a dream come true,” he said.
‘A WORKING MUSICIAN’
Balancing two demanding jobs is difficult, however, those close to Kantor say.
“It was definitely a challenge,” Courtney said. “But because [Kantor] loved both things, he made an extra effort to integrate both into his life.”
As organist, Kantor is responsible for playing all live music at the Red Sox’ home games, including iconic fanfares that have been a trademark at baseball games for decades.
At the same time, Kantor has continued to work for Harvard’s libraries.
As his roles and responsibilities at the Law School library began to evolve, he developed a keen interest in the possibility of bringing music to his regular vocation. In 2013, he transferred jobs and started working at the University’s music library.
Kantor said that in the music library, he discovered “a culture and understanding of the life of a working musician,” since his colleagues are “engaged in other musical endeavors outside of work.”
Currently, he works afternoons in the Isham Memorial Library, an adjunct library to the Loeb Music Library, which is devoted to special collections for scholarly research in music. The part-time job complements his schedule well, freeing up evenings and weekends for baseball games, and allowing him to pursue his outside musical career through recording sessions in the mornings. In fact, Kantor often finds himself sitting alongside Harvard students and researchers as he takes the M2 shuttle on his way from the University to Fenway.
Kantor says his commitments to music are not limited to his work with Harvard and the Red Sox. When he is not playing at Fenway or leafing through thousands of reels of microfilm that are copies of Mozart’s original manuscripts, Kantor travels around the country performing and recording with his bands: Jim’s Big Ego, the Split Squad, and The Baseball Project.
RETURNING TO THE PARK
Kantor said he is thrilled to return to Fenway to kick off the season, especially after the team’s success in 2013, when the Red Sox won the World Series at home for the first time since 1918. The championship game victory was particularly exciting for Kantor because the game was at home, meaning that he played for one of the largest television and live audiences of the baseball season.
Looking toward the first home game of this season, Kantor predicted “a very exciting atmosphere,” with fans and players riding on the excitement and spirit of last season.
“In some ways it takes some of the pressure off my department, the people doing the audio and the video, because we know we can focus on what we know how to do and what we’re good at, and know and trust that the fans are going to be excited,” he said.
While there may be less pressure, Kantor said that he hopes to continue broadening his repertoire, while “continuing to do the job as well as I can and to do the job better than before.”
Kantor has also made it a priority to cultivate collaborative relationships with his colleagues at Fenway. T.J. Connelly, who became the Red Sox full-time DJ in 2008 after a few years as a backup DJ, said he looked to Kantor for guidance throughout his transition.
"We have a very close work relationship,” Connelly said, adding that Kantor, who plays by ear and memory, has an “incredible” versatility. “It’s absurd how good he is,” Connelly added.
Regardless of the season or the team’s record, Kantor said that he loves his job.
“Playing the organ and watching baseball [have]...been two of my favorite things to do in the world since I was very young,” Kantor said. “They have always been, throughout all the changes in my life, constant things that I have really loved.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
With the first community meeting regarding a realignment of the Massachusetts Turnpike scheduled for next Thursday, Allston residents said they hope the $260 million construction project will produce positive changes in the community.
 The construction will take place on Harvard-owned land and will require coordination between the state, the University, and current companies operating on the property, as a stretch of the Mass. Pike in Allston is rebuilt and straightened.
“Straightening the Turnpike is good for people who drive through Allston every day, but we want it to be good for those who live in Allston as well,” Allston resident Richard Parr ’01 said.
To that end, residents have mobilized around what they call the “People’s Pike,” a proposed recreational path for cyclists, joggers, and walkers connecting the Allston neighborhood with Harvard and the Charles River.
Resident Harry E. Mattison called the People’s Pike the combined vision of transportation advocates and the community that would compliment GreenDOT, the effort of the Massachusetts Department of Transportation to increase sustainability.
“We hope to see that this project in Allston embodies the spirit of the GreenDOT program,” said Mattison, who will sit on the Allston Interchange Improvement Task Force, an advisory board to MassDOT during the planning process for the Mass. Pike construction. He added that the People’s Pike would ensure that “cycling is not an afterthought.”
Resident Paola M. Ferrer said that, as a grassroots campaign, the People’s Pike initiative creates more connections than just physical bicycle paths throughout the neighborhood. Ferrer said that efforts to increase the permeability and “liveability” of the neighborhood have mobilized groups of Allston residents, such as the non-English speaking community, who may not have had the opportunity to participate in community activism in the past.
“There is an opportunity here for us to make a meaningful contribution to the future of the neighborhood and to encourage participation from many voices,” she said.
Announced last October, the Mass. Pike straightening project will rebuild a half-mile long viaduct supported by 29 spans built in the mid-1960s that are now structurally deficient. The project will straighten turns at the existing Allston-Brighton toll areas to support new electric “open road” tolling and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by reducing congestion in the traffic-heavy area.
“Mistakes of the 1960s can be torn down and rebuilt for a new era of transportation,” Allston resident Galen M. Mook said.
The viaduct lies above a 91-acre parcel of land that Harvard bought from the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority in 2003. Most of the property consists of railways used by railroad company CSX and the commuter rail of the MBTA.
A large part of the railyard was freed up last year when CSX began to move its operations to Westborough and Worcester. However, the company and the MBTA still hold easement rights to the rail yards, meaning that they are allowed to operate on the University’s property.
Straightening the Mass. Pike would involve construction on Harvard’s property and necessitates the yielding of all of CSX’s easement rights back to the University. Talks between Harvard and CSX about the parameters of yielding these rights and discussions regarding the state’s construction plans are in very early stages, according to a statement from Kevin Casey, Harvard’s acting vice president of public affairs.
 
“As CSX continues the process of transferring its business operations west of Boston and the timing of the transfer of the property to Harvard becomes more clear, we will continue our discussions with the Commonwealth about the many issues associated with this parcel,” Casey wrote.
Allston residents will meet with MassDOT on Thursday, April 10, for the first public meeting concerning the Mass. Pike project. According to Ferrer, the readiness of developers at the DOT to listen to the concerns of the neighborhood signals a positive start to the construction process.
“This is an opportunity for us to chime in and inspire true change in the way that our landscape looks,” Ferrer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the third time this year, Cambridge developer Raj Dhanda and his proposal to build three stories of residential microunits on top of the existing Galeria building in Winthrop Square failed to earn the support of the Cambridge Historical Commission. 
The commission voted unanimously to deny Dhanda’s approval Thursday night, but will allow Dhanda to submit a completely new plan, according to Cambridge resident and activist James Williamson.
The commission also asked Historical Commission staff and board members, including Commission Executive Charles Sullivan, to draw up a set of regulations by which Dhanda’s future proposals for the site must abide by, Williamson said.
At Thursday night’s meeting, hosted in the Cambridge Senior Center, Dhanda and his architect, Peter Quinn, presented their amended plans to the board and about 30 members of the public. The audience included many Cambridge residents who have been working together over the past few weeks to prevent the development that they believe would infringe on historic Winthrop Park.
During this presentation, Dhanda and Quinn addressed concerns expressed at the previous Historical Commission meeting in March, at which some attendees raised concerns about the development’s aesthetics and impact on the surrounding area. Citing community worries about the bulk of the building, Dhanda noted the new decreased size of the proposed building, especially the recessed upper corner at the intersection of JFK and Winthrop streets. He presented a shadow study to illustrate how the changes reduced the impact of shadows on the park.
Dhanda remarked that the building materials had been adjusted to better suit the neighborhood surroundings, and Quinn added that the team had made efforts to better integrate the proposed addition with the existing levels of the building.
“[The new building plans are] friendlier and elegant, and all materials and workmanship will be of the highest order,” Dhanda said.
However, during the section of the meeting reserved for community members to voice their concerns, many Cambridge residents objected to the plan. Some chose to allow resident and activist Carole Perault to speak on their behalf.
“The Galeria as it was conceived was not meant to carry five stories,” said Perault, who presented a powerpoint of her objections. “It is incongruous to the district’s functional and visual environment.”
Perault also voiced concerns about what she characterized as an increase in artificial light, a loss of sky and open space, and the possibility that approval of the development would be a “tipping point” in which the “integrity of the district” becomes secondary to economic development.
Other topics of discussions included the accuracy of the shadow studies, the use of window shades, and even bike storage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Benjamin A. Mezrich ’91, author of “The Accidental Billionaires,” and his college roommate, Scott H. Stossel ’91, the editor of The Atlantic magazine, told aspiring writers about the benefits of self-confidence and the beauty of being published Thursday evening during an event in Sever Hall.
The event, sponsored by the Harvard College Writing Program, allowed both author’s to tell the story of how they progressed from being students at the College to bestselling writers, and was filled with personal experiences and anecdotes.


“We both knew that we wanted to be writers pretty early on,” said Mezrich, who, according to Stossel, wrote a novel in his sophomore year.
Mezrich and Stossel recalled writing for the Harvard Independent and covering the Harvard football team.
“Scott and I were terrified of people larger than us,” Mezrich said, adding that this made the task of interviewing football players more daunting.
Stossel recalled that Mezrich “papered the wall with rejection slips” from publishers. At one point, the wall was covered with 190 rejection slips. However, the rejections did not put Mezrich down.
“I loved the rejection,” said Mezrich, who explained how being delusional about his talent and potential helped him overcome rejection. “You have to have this incredible level of delusion when you are a writer.”
After graduating from the College, both authors applied to Law School. However, both retracted their applications to pursue writing careers, which Stossel admits, “freaked his parents out.”
After the decision, Mezrich and Stossel moved to an apartment in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, where they took part-time jobs at City Year and a bookstore, respectively, while devoting most of their time to writing. Having bonded with each other as roommates during and after college, Mezrich and Stossel said they still rely on each other for advice and criticism.
Stossel admitted that every time Mezrich sends him one of his recent works, Mezrich says, “This is the best thing I’ve written and my dad agrees.”
Mezrich, whose book became the basis for the movie "The Social Network" added that as a writer he relies on self-confidence.
“If you’re not believing in yourself, it’s not going to happen,” he said.
To this, Stossel commented, “more than talent, [as a writer] you need to have persistence and resilience and a really thick skin.”
In his final comments, Mezrich described the joy of having a published book. “The first time you see your book in a bookstore is the best moment of your life, it's like the first time you have sex.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Penn State men’s volleyball team (17-6, 8-1 EIVA) has won the EIVA conference championship for the last 15 years straight, dominating the league in recent memory. On Friday night, it will be coming to challenge Harvard (12-6, 8-2 EIVA) and for the first time in years, the Nittany Lions will not be runaway favorites.
“The team’s been looking forward to this one for a while,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “We’re excited for both these teams this weekend.”
Only three spaces separate the two teams in the national rankings with Penn State coming in ranked 12th and the Crimson at No. 15.
While Harvard has been excellent at home this season—the Crimson is currently on a seven-game home win streak, with six wins in straight sets—history does lie with the visitors. Penn State is 8-1 against Harvard in its previous nine meetings, with the Crimson’s lone victory coming last season at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Nittany Lions have since avenged that defeat, winning the EIVA postseason final in straight sets, and then doing so again this season when the teams met in Pennsylvania.
At stake for both teams is the top seed for the EIVA tournament, which is crucial as the top seed hosts the tournament and draws an easier semifinal draw. A Penn State win all but wraps up the one seed for them, with only a single loss to Princeton in conference play so far this season. Harvard swept the Tigers this season but has already fallen twice in conference play—once to Penn State and once in an upset loss away to George Mason.
A Crimson win would tie the two teams atop the EIVA with an even head-to-head record. According to the EIVA rules, the next determinant to end the tie is head-to-head games won. Given Harvard lost to Penn State in straight sets earlier this season, only a straight sets win would tie things up, else Penn State would have to falter again down the stretch for the Crimson to gain home-court advantage in the playoffs.
“I think the team that’s going to win that match is the team that is the steadiest,” said Harvard coach Brian Baise, speaking last weekend. “I think that’s going to be about star players stepping up. I think if we can handle their serves, and I think we can and we’ve improved a lot in that area, we will be right there with them. It’s going to be a lot of fun. There will be a lot of people here, and they’re a great team, but I feel like if we’re not helping them, and we’re not making unforced errors I think we’ll be right there with them.”
While many Nittany Lions have received acclaim, one stands out. Reigning EIVA Offensive Player of the Week and preseason All-American junior Aaron Russell is a 6’9’’ power hitter who leads the Penn State offense with four kills a set at a hitting percentage of .347, both of which lead the team. Stopping Russell will be vital for Harvard.
“They’re able to play good all-around volleyball,” co-captain Chris Gibbons said. “Defensively, they’re good. Offensively, they can beat you if they play hard. They’re just very solid at the fundamental parts of volleyball so we have to step up and play good volleyball ourselves.”
This season the Crimson has been at its best when its offense has been performing well. According to Madden, igniting that spark is the key to winning.
“I think a lot of [the game] is going to come down to our serving and passing,” Madden said. “If we serve well enough to keep them off net and put some pressure on them, then that will help our defense out a lot. And if we’re passing well, I think our offense will be flowing. If we serve and pass well I think we’ve got a good shot.”
As for the strength of Harvard’s opponent, Madden cites the speed with which the Nittany Lions attack as a vital factor.
“They have a very fast offense which is tough to play defense against,” Madden said. “You have to read the center really well and you have to get hands up over the middle. They’re a pretty well balanced team and the fast offense will put some pressure on us but we’ve been preparing for that and I think we should be ready.”
After the Penn State tilt, the Crimson will host St. Francis on Saturday afternoon. According to Madden, it is a huge weekend of volleyball for Harvard and perhaps the beginning of the end of Penn State’s dominance over the EIVA.
“If we get wins this Friday and Saturday, it would one clinch the playoffs for us and two give us a lot of momentum going into the postseason and also give us a chance to take first place in our league which is something we have never done,” Madden said. “It would mean a lot to us to get two wins this weekend and we’re practicing with that in mind.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In one of Harvard’s toughest losses last season, the then-No. 2 Cornell men’s lacrosse squad rallied from a 12-9 deficit, making up three goals in the final three and a half minutes to stun the Crimson at Harvard Stadium.
Just one year later, the teams will face off in Ithaca with major Ivy League implications on the line. Harvard (5-4, 2-0 Ivy) and the Big Red (9-0, 3-0) enter the match as the two remaining undefeated teams in Ivy League play, with the winner of the match taking control of the league halfway through the six-game conference race.
“We were up on them last year and blew a big lead in the fourth quarter,” said senior defenseman and co-captain Joe Petrucci. “We know we can play with these guys and compete. It will be a dogfight; we know we have the capability to win but this time we have to play the full 60 minutes.”
Cornell enters the match as the only undefeated team in the nation. A year after losing in the national semifinals to eventual champion Duke, Cornell is on a nine-game winning streak, making it one of the most dangerous teams that the Crimson will face this season.
“They’re a very good team,” Harvard coach Peter Wojcik said. “They’re a good faceoff team, they have a very strong, effective offense. They’re consistently good at [scoring] goals and they have the ability to stop opposing teams as well. They’re undefeated for a reason.”
The Big Red, led by interim coach Matt Kerwick, has established a prolific offensive attack with an average of 14.89 goals and 37.6 ground balls per game, good for second in the nation in both categories. The Cornell attack is led by senior attackman Dan Lintner, whose 32 goals and 3.56 goals per game rank third in the country.
In addition, the Big Red has four other players who have registered over 20 points on the season. Junior attackman Matt Donovan and Connor Buczek come in as the point leaders for Cornell with both players scoring over 20 goals while contributing 10 or more assists. Defensively, the Big Red ranks 10th in the nation in terms of scoring defense, holding opponents to 8.56 goals per game throughout the season.
The Crimson defense will have a tall task ahead of them against the Cornell attack, but will be aided by the return of Petrucci. The co-captain was out for four games after sustaining a concussion versus Brown and will provide a much needed boost in the back third. Petrucci’s presence will help junior goalkeeper Jake Gambitsky, who leads Harvard with 10.67 saves per game and ranks just outside of the top 20 goalkeepers in the nation in that category.
Maintaining a strong midfield game will also be key for the Crimson. Though much of it does not show up on the stat sheet, Petrucci said that keeping a strong control near the middle of the game with timely hits, transition passes and a general aggressiveness is important for a successful Harvard attack.
“It’s important to have midfielders that can perform the whole game,” Petrucci said. “We have three defensive midfielders that can run with anybody and that’s going to be a big part of the game.”
Offensively, the Crimson hope to break the stalwart Big Red defense with a balanced attack. Sophomore attackman Will Walker leads the team with 22 goals on the season and comes in on a hot streak, having scored three or more goals in four of his past five games.
Senior midfielder and co-captain Peter Schwartz has been another offensive spark for Harvard, with 25 points off of 13 assists and 12 goals. Sophomore attackman Devin Dwyer, meanwhile, leads the team with 17 assists on the season to go along with five goals. Dwyer has a total of 22 points on just five games after missing the first four due to a hand injury.
This is the fifth game of the season in which Harvard faces off versus ranked opposition after facing then-No. 14 UMass, No. 17 Albany, No. 6 North Carolina and No. 3 Duke. This game carries even more importance due to the implications it has in the Ivy League. Since the Ancient Eight plays a short schedule, accoridng to Wojcik, each game carries much more importance.
“It’s a very important game,” Wojcik said. “Since we’re the two undefeated teams in the league it’s naturally a pivotal game. There’s only six Ivy League games but this is the biggest game of the year especially because it’s our next one.”
Though the team has struggled to nab a victory versus ranked teams, losing all four contests, Petrucci said the experience gained from those games has proven to be invaluable and the team does not plan on changing their philosophy based on the ranking of their opponent.“
Regardless of who we play we expect to come out with a win,” Petrucci said. “It doesn’t matter whether they’re a top-five team or unranked because we play all teams the same way. [But] playing all these [ranked] teams definitely gives us more confidence going into conference play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After smacking a one-out triple to the corner, then-freshman Zoe Galindo was just 60 feet away from giving the Harvard softball team a two-run lead over Dartmouth in the first of two must-win games for the Crimson during the final weekend of the 2013 regular season.
But Galindo never made it those 60 feet, and the Big Green eventually went on to win the contest on a home run in the eighth. With that, Dartmouth ended Harvard’s streak of four straight Ivy League Championship Series appearances and hopes of making a run with one of its youngest squads in recent years.
After falling just short, it’s not just the heartbreaking end that sticks with the team, but all of the missed opportunities throughout the season. If the Crimson hadn’t given up a four-run lead in the bottom of the seventh to drop a game against Brown, or given up five runs in the final two innings to spoil its 7-5 lead against Cornell earlier in the season, the team may have entered its final weekend in better position to move onto the Ivy League Championship.
If last year’s experience taught this team anything, it is that it is not just about the final series. Any game can make or break the season.
“We’re just going into the season treating every game like it’s the championship series,” co-captain Shelbi Olson said. “Every game counts at the end when it comes down to who gets to go to Ivies.”
With this approach to its season, the Crimson (13-11) needs consistency. It’s not just about strong pitching, steady defense, and timely hitting, but getting all three of these factors working together in every game.
But here Harvard has an advantage over where it was this time last year: the team is older and more experienced. Olson, one of the team’s three seniors, returns as a captain for the second year in a row.
“This year has been a lot easier because I know what to expect and what is expected of me,” Olson said. “[Over the past two years], I’ve learned more about myself and tried to make myself the best player I can....  You can’t help anyone else if you aren’t in a good spot.”
For Olson, this means continuing to set the table for the Crimson offense after she finished last season leading the Ivy League with a .370 batting average against conference opponents and 16 stolen bases.
Kasey Lange shares the captain spot with Olson this season. Lange has had a hot start to the year, with a .547 slugging percentage, 18 RBIs, and three homers in nonconference play this spring.
But the big difference this year is the team’s improved junior class.
“We are seeing Emily Gusse playing better, Katie Lantz playing better defensively, Katie Appelbe playing better,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “All those players that got so much playing time and experience last year...are [now] having really solid contributory performances.”
Although the Crimson has seen offensive production from different players throughout the lineup in the early part of its season, the team has not been able to manufacture runs as consistently as it would like to.
“One of the strengths of this team is that there are a number of people who can come up in different situations, different scenarios, and come through,” Allard said. “We just need to be more consistent with that.”
In conference play, Harvard will need more clutch hitting, especially if it hopes to overtake Dartmouth and Penn in the Ivy League standings. Both teams  return their aces—Kristen Rumley and Alexis Borden, respectively—to the mound this season. But the Crimson returns an ace of its own in junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone. Before missing last season, Ricciardone was named to the All-Ivy League second team in 2011 and 2012, helping the Crimson to two consecutive Ivy League Championship titles.
Ricciardone has wasted no time proving she was ready to step up this season. She recorded a 2.42 ERA and notched five wins in the nonconference half of the season.
The Crimson also has greater depth on the mound than it did a year ago. Junior Gabrielle Ruiz, sophomore Morgan Groom, and freshman Taylor Cabe have already proven that they have what it takes to pitch in tight games and high-pressure situations. Each has an ERA under 2.50 going into the meat of conference play.
An Ivy League Championship eluded last year’s squad, but a more experienced team with better depth is poised to reclaim that title this season. For now, however, Allard has put the team’s focus squarely on performance, not end-of-season titles.
“One thing Harvard softball does very well is that Harvard softball focuses on Harvard softball,” Allard said. “So our job is to be the best team, we can be and get all of our players individually playing their best and collectively. We trust that if we do that, the process is going to take care of itself.”

On a windy day in April 2013, the Harvard baseball team took the field against Princeton in the rubber game of a doubleheader. The Crimson had decisively lost the first contest to the Tigers, 13-1, and was looking to bounce back to split the series at O’Donnell Field. What ensued was wilder than anyone could have imagined.
Complete dominance by Princeton in the first game transformed into a back-and-forth, high-scoring battle in the second that kept spectators guessing while players on both sides fought for victory.
Heading into the bottom of the ninth trailing, 19-17, Harvard needed three runs to notch the win. And in a stroke of good luck for the Crimson, three wild pitches resulted in a trio of runs, and Harvard walked off with the victory when then-sophomore outfielder Brandon Kregel slid into home plate.
The three wild pitches and subsequent scores were by no means the only staggering statistics during this unusual Ivy League contest.
The entire game witnessed sloppy plays, and some players do not look back with fond feelings.
“All I can say about that game is that it was painful to watch,” sophomore pitcher Sean Poppen said. “It was just messy baseball. Lots of errors, poor pitching—I started that game, so I should know. It was exciting from a competitive standpoint, but I think both teams were embarrassed [by] their performances that day.”
The two teams combined for nine errors, five of which were charged to the Crimson as the defense surrendered a season-high 19 runs. But Harvard also tallied 20 runs, a whopping ten more than its previous season-high against Cornell, and registered 23 hits to Princeton’s 15.
But while it was certainly a record-breaking day on the scoreboard, individual performances stood out in the rollercoaster of a game.
Then-freshman catcher DJ Link smacked a pair of doubles, going 4-for-5 on the game, while classmate Mitch Klug registered three hits and scored four runs.
Five Harvard players contributed at least three hits as the whole lineup got in on the action.
Then-sophomore second baseman and pitcher Tanner Anderson hit a grand slam for the Crimson, and the Tigers had a grand slam of their own. Anderson also chipped in four RBIs, and then-freshman first baseman and pitcher Sean O’Neill accomplished the same feat.
Emotions are varied about the game in retrospect. On the one hand, the game brought errors and mistakes. But the battle and the Harvard rally after being down by six runs in the second inning created a competitive atmosphere that serves as the enduring memory for most Crimson players.
“It was a crazy game, with lead changes left and right,” sophomore pitcher TJ Laurisch said. “The weather didn’t help, with [heavy winds making] every ball in the air exponentially tougher to catch. It was...one of my favorite games because we rallied as a team and really pulled together to battle through the adversity and win.”
The winds reached up to 40 miles per hour, and with the obvious strain on fielding it caused, batters were able to capitalize.
The teams traded significant leads throughout the afternoon. Princeton was up by six in the top of the second, and then Harvard found itself leading, 17-10, in the bottom of the sixth. But no team could stay ahead for more than a couple of innings.
“[That] was by far the craziest baseball game I’ve ever been a part of,” Link said. “After losing a tough one in game one of that doubleheader, it was great that we pulled together as a team and came out of that eventful second game with the win.”
The back-and-forth nature of the contest is evident in the distribution of runs across 11 frames. Only two innings witnessed fewer than two runs, making for an action-packed contest.
The bottom of the ninth embodied the game’s craziness in just half an inning. The wild pitches and three Crimson runs sealed the win, as Harvard players scampered around the bases with each pitch that eluded the catcher. Just like that, the Crimson had notched its third Ancient Eight victory of the season.
“That game,” then-junior utilityman Carlton Bailey said, “was wild.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seeing your starting spot disappear is tough. It’s even tougher when you had dominated the year before.
Last season, then-freshman pitcher Morgan Groom started 19 games, posted the third-best ERA in the Ivy League at 2.58, and finished in the league’s top five with 96 strikeouts. Despite those electric numbers, Groom has gone from the number one option in the circle to the third for the Harvard softball team.
“Groom brings great experience to the staff,” junior pitcher Laura Ricciardone said. “She handled the bulk of the work last year and has returned with even more experience and talent.”
After being named to the All-Ivy second team, Groom has only started five games for the Crimson this year. Groom has pitched more relief innings and has had fewer starts, but her reduced role isn’t the result of poor performance.
Instead, the return of Ricciardone and the addition of freshman Taylor Cabe have led to a new one-two punch for Harvard coach Jenny Allard.
“Laura is in tremendous shape,” Allard said. “She really has returned in the best shape of her career. Her stamina is terrific.”
Two years ago, Harvard won its second consecutive Ivy League championship and two NCAA tournament games. But that’s all a distant memory now.
As Ancient Eight play commences, the quartet of Ricciardone, Cabe, Groom, and junior Gabrielle Ruiz will be tasked with the lofty expectations of returning Harvard to the top of the league and clinching a spot in postseason play.
After spending last season training at home, Ricciardone has returned to carry the pitching load for Harvard. Though she was not with her team last year, Ricciardone still followed the team’s lifting schedule and trained individually.
With a record of 5-5, Ricciardone has an ERA of 2.42 and has already fanned 39 batters in 73.2 innings. She currently has the third-most strikeouts, second-most wins, and eighth-best ERA in the Ivy League.
The junior hurler, who was second-team All-Ivy her sophomore year, showed some of her old tricks on Opening Day this year. She pitched a complete game shutout, allowing only three hits and racking up eight strikeouts to beat Eastern Michigan.
“We are expecting [Ricciardone] to pick up where she left off end of her sophomore year, and she’s done that,” Allard said.
Ricciardone struggled against Florida Gulf Coast, conceding three earned runs and picking up her first loss of the season. But a week later, Ricciardone reminded her teammates of just how assertive she can be in the circle.
Facing No. 22 Louisiana State on its home turf, Ricciardone shut out the Tigers. The junior was ruthless, pitching a 12-inning complete game, striking out nine batters and only allowing seven hits.
“It’s great to have Laura back,” Groom said. “She was really strong her first two years and has brought a lot of experience to our staff.”
While Ricciardone has shined in her return, the freshman Cabe has far from disappeared in the upperclassman’s shadow. Instead, the first-year pitcher has worked her way into the starting rotation to become Harvard’s No. 2 pitcher.
“Cabe has great command of all her pitches,” Allard said. “She is a work horse and a diligent pitcher. We are excited to have her on the staff.”
Though she has struggled early on, posting a 3-6 record, Cabe has remains at a steady 2.44 ERA, good for eighth in the Ancient Eight. Though she struggled in early outings against North Dakota and Arkansas, the Boiling Springs, S.C. native has become much more consistent as the year has progressed, showing why she was so sought after as a recruit.
“Taylor got on our radar screen when she came up to a winter camp,” Allard said. “She was being heavily recruited by other schools as well, but she felt like the balance academically and athletically was right for her here, and we lucked out.”
The fourth pitcher on the staff, Ruiz, primarily pitches in relief. Ruiz is a lefty and has progressed consistently since her freshman season and has become a key asset in securing wins for the Crimson.
“Ruiz has really owned her role as a relief pitcher,” Ricciardone said. “She comes in under extreme pressure situations at the end of the game and is lights out. “
With Ricciardone and Cabe taking over the majority of the innings, Groom and Ruiz round out what could be the best pitching staff in the Ancient Eight this year. And alhough the latter pair pitch far fewer innings than Ricciardone and Cabe, that hasn’t stopped Groom and Ruiz from competing at a high level. In fact, Groom boasts a team-low 2.13 ERA, and Ruiz has given up only eight hits and three runs in the 8.2 innings she has pitched.
“It truly is the four of us—we are a short pitching staff, but it’s a blessing to be a part of,” Ricciardone said. “We really support one another and we work very well together with our pitching styles.”
With each pitcher throwing at a high level, practices have brought out a healthy competition between the four, according to Allard. While each pitcher wants her shot to lead the staff, team success has taken a front seat.
“It’s been helpful to have more competition among the team,” Allard said.
After a rough trip to California, the Crimson was 2-7 with only two games remaining before Ivy play. But rather than roll over, the pitching staff used these early season losses as a stepping stone in learning to be more assertive.
In the final two games of the trip, Ricciardone and Cabe pitched all 14 innings, allowing three earned runs and picking up a pair of victories. Though the wins do not contribute to conference standings, they were pivotal in restoring the confidence of a team that found itself lacking exactly that.
“After [the California trip], Coach wanted us to get a killer instinct,” Groom said. “Even though we had a tough time...we are in a good spot for Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a snowy morning in March, but the Harvard baseball program isn’t taking any breaks.
Two assistant coaches are working in a room on the upper level of Dillon Field  House. A whiteboard lists detailed practice schedules and upcoming dates. And in his own office, Crimson head coach Bill Decker is peering at a few sheets of paper sitting on his desk.
It isn’t the first time Decker’s eyes have strayed downward. He has routinely consulted tables of statistics to provide context when discussing his team’s performance on the season thus far.
He doesn’t just examine the box scores—which, as Decker notes, can be deceiving—but typically devotes his attention to more detailed notes, including those that chart quality-at-bats and pitch-by-pitch sequences. He points to baserunning as a particular point of emphasis this season.
“If you look at the statistics last year, people tended to run on us a little bit—which is an understatement,” Decker says. “We’re going to control the running game [this season], and it’s going to start with the pitchers.”
Indeed, Decker is a man of the details. For him, games are won when the little things are taken care of.
Now, in his second year at the helm of the team, Decker’s office across the Charles River is starting to feel more like home. He can now turn his focus to developing a successful baseball program and instilling his vision for success.
When Harvard hosts Penn at O’Donnell Field this Saturday, the Crimson will compete at home for the first time all season. If Decker has his way, in a few years, the trip to Cambridge will not be one that opponents enjoy making.
“My goal is to come in here and take this program and get it back where it needs to be, and that’s at the forefront of the Ivy League,” Decker says. “That’s my goal. We’re going to do it the right way with the right student-athletes that want to come to Harvard and can succeed at Harvard, on and off the field.”
A NEW TRANSITION
Although Decker is entering his second year coaching at Harvard, the current season could just as well be considered his first full stint.
After the July 2012 passing of former head coach Joe Walsh, the face of the Crimson baseball program for 17 years, the search for a new head coach began in earnest. Decker’s hiring was announced in late September, and he didn’t set foot on campus until early October.
In addition to having to adapt to a new city and a new job, Decker had to rapidly get to know his team and assess the state of the program.
“The whole hiring process, due to the untimely death of Joe, happened very, very late,” said Decker at the beginning of the 2013 campaign. “So my expectations were to come in here and really just look and get a feel for what had happened.”
Before accepting the Harvard job, Decker spent 22 years as head baseball coach for Trinity College, where he eventually became the all-time winningest coach in school history with a record of 529-231.
In 2008, Trinity posted a 45-1 record and captured a Division III National Championship, and Decker earned the recognition of ABCA National Coach of the Year.
The move to Division I has presented Decker with expanded opportunities to implement a rigorous vision for a program.
At D-III Trinity, the baseball season does not officially begin until mid-February. Teams are held to tighter time regulations, and the ability to practice in the fall is restricted.
But at Harvard, the season goes year-round, from offseason team workouts to winter practices in the stadium bubble to the spring campaign. A rigorous spring schedule—with trips throughout the country in the early weeks of the season and two doubleheaders a weekend during conference play—offers plenty of time for instruction and improvement.
“One of the reasons that I chose to accept this position was the chance to be on the field and work with kids every single day, which is awesome,” Decker says. “The fact that we play a pretty darn good schedule is attractive, as well. But for me personally, it’s about being able to teach and coach the game every day.”
And despite the differences in scheduling and time commitment, Decker’s approach to what happens on the playing field remains largely unchanged.
“The game of baseball is the game of baseball,” Decker says. “I think when you talk to coaches, you need to pitch and play defense. The way the new bats are, and the way the offensive approach is, you have to produce runs. And then you have to be athletic and have the guys who can do what you want to do.”
DEVOTION TO THE DETAILS
Many college baseball coaches will try to break the game down into its smallest components for their players. They speak of hitting behind runners to move them over, positioning defenders based on the count, and keeping opposing hitters from taking extra bases.
Decker shares this belief in focusing on the details, and he doesn’t consider their fulfillment secondary to any other goal. Indeed, Decker is working to establish an entire culture revolving around attention to the little things.
Take baserunning. According to Decker, Harvard finished dead last out of all Division I teams in stolen bases last season. In 41 games played, the Crimson successfully swiped only 14 bags.
But Decker has ensured that things will change in his second year, making the subject a point of emphasis in the offseason.
Through 17 games, Harvard baserunners have already exceeded last year’s total, posting 16 stolen bases while being caught just three times.
Decker’s players emphasize the coach’s constant attention to detail and his belief that larger success depends on the little things being taken care of first.
“[Decker] doesn’t really focus on home runs or big hits like a lot of teams do,” junior outfielder Brandon Kregel says. “He focuses on baserunning and small ball, moving runners over, hitting behind runners, line drives.”
Many head coaches in college elect to remain in the dugout during games, giving signals from the bench. But last season, Decker operated from the third base coaching box, reflecting his desire to be as involved as he can in the action.
In the first two games of Harvard’s recent spring break trip, the Crimson offense never got going, as the team was shut out in both games of a doubleheader against Michigan State. To find a solution, the Harvard coaching staff turned to the details. In the two losses, a number of Crimson hitters had settled for weak pop-ups, so the coaches prodded players to make adjustments to their swings.
“We sat down with our coaches [after the doubleheader], and they really emphasized getting the top hand through and swinging down on the ball to put more barrel on the ball,” Kregel said. “The day that we had off [after the games], we did that in batting practice.”
Sure enough, in the next game against the Spartans, the Harvard offense came alive. Hitters came through with runners in scoring position as the Crimson scored a season-high seven runs to earn the victory.
Decker has also shifted the focus away from big hits to ensuring that his players always have a good approach at the plate. For each of the first two weeks of the 2014 season, the team has named one player a “quality-at-bat winner,” a statistic that considers not only hits, but also pitches seen, situational hitting, and sacrifices.
“I think we’ve started to take on our way of doing it, which is detail,” Decker says. “Trying to learn. We’re going to compete. We’re going to play, and we’re going to carry ourselves with a sense of who we are in our energy level and our attention to detail.”
BUILDING A PROGRAM
The first year at Harvard may have seemed like a blur, but Decker is now settled into his new coaching position. He can thus turn his focus to constructing a program—bringing in the right guys, establishing routines, and promoting a positive culture.
Much of this direction inevitably comes from the coaching staff. Shortly after being hired, Decker brought in Jeff Calcaterra, a former head coach who serves as the Crimson’s top assistant and recruiting coordinator. Mike Zandler, another former head coach at a Division II school, is currently in his first season as assistant coach.
Morgan Brown ’06, a former captain and All-Ivy shortstop, rounds out the staff.
But according to Decker, coaches can only do so much. For the team to have success, everyone involved in the baseball program—from coaches to players to equipment managers—must buy in and work together.
“I go back to the word ‘our.’ It’s not mine. It’s our program,” Decker says. “I learn from [the players], we learn from each other as coaches, we try to put something together that works for us.”
Recruiting inevitably plays a large role in a coach’s ability to build a program. As Decker arrived on campus in the fall of 2012 with the college process well underway for high school seniors, he was limited in his ability to assert his own recruiting vision. Walsh and former Harvard recruiting coordinator Tom Lo Ricco had already zeroed in on a group of players, and Decker elected to stick with that list. Five freshmen are on the team’s roster for the 2014 season.
“I continued to support [the current freshmen],” Decker says. “During the recruiting process, there was a list that was already formulated. Several of these kids, Harvard had already made a commitment to them in terms of supporting them. I felt that the right thing to do was to continue to support the candidates that were on the list.”
This decision was made easier because Decker had already seen four of the five current freshmen during his travels—the exception being freshman pitcher Nick Gruener, who has already made four starts for the Crimson.
Decker’s first true recruiting class will arrive at Harvard this coming fall. Thanks to the assistance of his coaching staff, Decker believes that the baseball program has already grown stronger due to the group of high school seniors he intends to bring in.
“I thought our staff did a good job last summer identifying the right people, academically and athletically and otherwise, that should be at Harvard,” Decker says. “And the kids I think are going to compete and grow. That’s the first real step, and I think we’re happy with it.”
With a year under his belt, Decker is now better equipped to assess the state of the program. By focusing on particular team needs in the recruiting process, Decker hopes to bring in players who have the ability to fill certain holes.
For instance, Harvard has just one left-handed hitter on its roster. So, Decker says, a priority is going out and finding some lefties who are the right fit for Harvard.
“There are going to be some challenges,” Decker says. “It’s going to take a little bit of time in terms of trying to upgrade some of the things that we’re trying to do. Respectfully to everybody, my big thing is help is on the way. Whatever area we need in terms of trying to build a program like it used to be.”
WIN TODAY
Last year, Decker inherited a program in flux. But now that he is settled in, the team is his for the shaping.
Decker constantly has his eye on the bigger picture. Instead of getting caught up in individual wins or losses, he emphasizes player development and keeping the focus geared on the immediate future. In other words, stick to the process.
“He’s really a guy who always stays calm,” Kregel says. “He’s always thinking about moving forward. Even [after beating Michigan State], when everybody was pumped. He said, ‘Listen, it was a good game; you guys played well. But we have to keep on thinking about the next game tomorrow.’ Even when we lose, he just says we have to make some changes and keep on going.”
22 years at Trinity—20 of them winning seasons—was no easy thing to walk away from. For Decker, one particular draw to Harvard was the energy he found throughout the school community. The opportunity to work with a motivated group of people day in and day out was too good to turn down.
“I interviewed here and came back several times, and I was just impressed with the way people walked and the energy level they had,” Decker says. “They could come over the river and walk across the bridge and, boom, let’s get after it…. If you walk through the square, it’s kind of electric.”
2014 is Decker’s second season at the helm of the Crimson, and it is his first full-year campaign. By bringing a renewed focus on the details and establishing a vision for the program’s future, he hopes to guide Harvard back to the top of the Ivy League.
Ultimately, Decker’s philosophy revolves around the phrase “win today.” If players work hard every day, compete as a team, and do the little things, then the victories will eventually come.
“My message was pretty clear when I came in here: We need to do things together,” Decker says. “The other thing, which is on the inside of our locker room, is you need to win today. That has nothing to do with the final outcome. It has to do with every chance you get to wake up every day and put your feet on the floor, you have a chance to do something special. It’s an attitude. It’s a way of life.”

You don’t feel compelled to be unconventional for unconventionality’s sake, and in the case of dorm square footage, this is probably a good thing – sometimes there is a reason for tradition. Continue making the best of the things that you have.
3) Shoe Holder: Found that your closet space was less than spectacular this year? Realized that you didn’t actually have to buy any hard copies of books because your readings are online for this semester?

While the biggest football game most of us at Harvard look forward to every year is Harvard-Yale, Kyle P. Juszczyk ’14 has his hopes on playing in the Super Bowl. Juszczyk, a former tight end for the Harvard football team, was drafted into the Baltimore Ravens last year and has returned to campus this semester during to complete his bachelor’s in economics during offseason. We caught up with him to ask about his life as an NFL player and an Ec concentrator (but mostly about being an NFL player)!
 Flyby: "Can you tell us a little bit about how you got drafted, and what the experience was like?"
KJ: “After the season [in 2012], I got invited to an all-star game, the Senior Bowl in Alabama. Then I got invited on 12 different pre-draft team visits, where teams fly you out to their facilities and you meet their coaches and they interview you and stuff. And then drafting finally came, and my family and I had a big draft party at my house back in Ohio and some of my teammates came out. We kind of waited for a call, and at the end of the 4th round, I got a call from a Baltimore zip code and then I knew right away that it was the Ravens, and I answered and I was so happy. The whole process was really unique and stressful at times, but obviously it all paid off and it was rewarding.”
Flyby: “Do you ever get starstruck by any NFL players, and if so, whom?KJ: “No, not so much. Now that I’m an NFL player as well, you know, I try to go in there with a professional attitude. Once you’ve hung out with big names like Joe Flacco and Ray Rice and Terrell Suggs, anyone else doesn’t really shock you. Even like when I met Tom Brady, it was just like meeting another guy.”
Flyby: “Do you have a favorite teammate?”KJ: “I guess if I were a fan, and not a player, of the Baltimore Ravens, I think I would choose Jacoby Jones as my favorite player just because he’s hilarious and he has the best touchdown celebrations.”
Flyby: “What team did you root for growing up?”KJ: “I was a Dallas [Cowboys] fan.”
Flyby: “How was playing football for Harvard like?”KJ: “It was a really good experience. It’s different playing a varsity sport at Harvard because we’re asked to do a lot academically and doing a sport on top of that is really a lot, but you learn how to get through things and basically just get stuff done when you have a lot on your plate.”
Flyby: “So how has it been juggling being a student at Harvard and an NFL football player?”KJ: “It’s been a little different transitioning and getting used to the college life again, you know being in a dorm and attending lectures and doing homework. But, you know, it’s kind of nice because, unlike a lot of seniors looking for jobs, I don’t have to worry about that. I just have schoolwork to catch up on, so I don’t have to divide my time searching for a job.”
Flyby: “How do you feel about d-hall food?”KJ: “You know what, I kind of like it. I don’t understand people not liking it a lot. There’s a lot of options, and if you want to eat healthy, you can do it really easily in the dining halls. I actually like it.”
Flyby: “And for all the freshmen that recently got housed, what are your thoughts on getting Quadded?” (Juszczyk lives in Pforzheimer House)KJ: “When I first found out, I was pretty upset. My roommate actually even cried. But after living out here for the past three years, I love it and I’m glad I got Quadded. I like being kind of away from everything and when I want to get involved with anything I can always just choose to go down to the Yard. It’s kind of a nice little getaway.”

  As you’re probably aware, Harvard students have recently rallied for Miley Cyrus to come to campus. And for good reason! I mean, who wouldn’t want Miley and her bear-suit wearing posse in Cambridge? And why stop at just Miley? Here’s a list of other extraordinarily talented, beloved celebs we would love to see in the Yard.
 
Nicolas Cage
  Nick Cage would be the ideal Harvard guest. After the success of movies like "Deadfall" and "Season of the Witch", it’s pretty obvious why he has such a large following. He might even let us know what his next blockbuster is going to be. "Ghost Rider 3", anyone?
 
Nickelback
 We’re all really excited to see Janelle Monáe perform at Yardfest, but can you imagine how incredible a concert from everyone’s favorite Canadian “rock” band would be? Their songs are filled with poignant lyrics such as “I want a brand new house/On an episode of Cribs/And a bathroom I can play baseball in.” A performance from these guys would be an unforgettable experience.
 
Mike “The Situation”
  The Situation has moved on to bigger and better things since "Jersey Shore", including starring in an upcoming reality show about his life at home with his mom and siblings. He’s a family man! Let’s invite him to campus and learn how he turned his life around. 
 
Taylor Swift
  Taylor is truly an inspiration to us all. She never let a live broadcast confrontation get her down, and she’s shown us a new approach to dealing with exes: if you can’t ignore them, write a song about them!
 
Sure we get tons of foreign diplomats and company CEOs on campus, but can we really learn anything from them? These celebrities are real inspirations, and we would gain a lot by hosting them here at Harvard.
