All of our (21 and over) dreams have finally come true! Beat Brasserie and Pinkberry are pairing up to create boozy fro-yo sundaes this Thursday, September 8th from 5 to 7 p.m. at their Boozy Ice Cream Social at Beat Brasserie. Seeing as ice cream and alcohol are college students' two favorite things, we can imagine that this will be a hit. Sundaes are $8 each and come in four flavors, including Banana Bread Pudding and Mango Martini.
September 8 also happens to be the day Study Cards are due, so why not celebrate getting your academic life (somewhat) together with a boozy sundae?
