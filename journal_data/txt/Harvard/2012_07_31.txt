After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The AMC Harvard Square Theater, which closed its doors on July 8, has been purchased by Cambridge real estate firm Carpenter & Company, Inc. for $6.5 million.
President and Chief Operating Officer Richard L. Friedman said that the property was attractive to Carpenter and Company because of its size and location.
“It’s a third of an acre, if you can believe that, in the middle of Harvard Square,” Friedman said.  “Since we’ve been doing business in Harvard Square for thirty-something years it seemed like a good thing to buy.”
Friedman also noted that the property comes with a disadvantage; namely, the 150 feet of blank wall space that it presents to the public.  However, Friedman said that Carpenter and Company’s experience in working with non-traditional spaces would enable it to solve this problem.
“We are very experienced at adaptive reuse,” Friedman said.  “We bring to this a capacity to look at things differently than most people.”
Carpenter & Company is known for its conversion of the Charles Street Jail into the Liberty Hotel, which opened in 2007.
According to Friedman, Carpenter & Company does not currently have a plan for a property, but has assembled a team of architects, engineers, and lawyers to determine what would be best.  The team expects to reach a decision in two to three months.
“We’re very enthusiastic about the potential of this property,” Friedman said.  “It’s a good chance to revitalize that part of Harvard Square.”
According to Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, Carpenter & Company has been a valuable member of the Harvard Square Business Association. The firm developed and currently owns the Charles Square Hotel.
“They’re good stewards of Harvard Square,” Jillson said. “They’re very thoughtful in their real estate development vision.”
She also noted that the AMC Harvard Square Theater was not a member of HSBA, which she said could have hurt their business.
“We were never able to cross-promote or market with them,” Jillson said. “We would hope that anyone coming in with such an iconic location would be a significant partner with us so that we could help them and cross-promote with other events.”

Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh died early this morning, according to the Harvard Athletic Department. No cause of death has been announced. He was 58.
In a statement, Athletic Director Bob Scalise expressed his grief.
“This is a tragic day for everyone associated with Harvard athletics, Massachusetts baseball and the larger baseball community,” Scalise said. “Joe's passion for the game redefined success in the Ivy League and he positively impacted the lives of so many people. To say that he will be missed would be an understatement.”
Walsh had served as the Crimson’s manager for 17 years, and spent most of his life in the Boston area.
"just don't believe it's real yet, incredibly saddened. The world lost a great man today," tweeted Andrew Ferreira, last year's co-captain who recently signed with the Minnesota Twins.
A native of West Roxbury, Walsh was twice named the Northeast Region Division I Coach of the Year by the American Baseball Coaches Association and spent time coaching in the historic Cape Cod League as well as in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Day four at the London Olympic Games was one of the bitter defeat for the lone Harvard alum in competition. Will Newell ’11 and his American boat narrowly missed out on the A final of men’s lightweight four at the Eton Dorney rowing complex. Racing in lane one of the first semifinal, Newell and co. stayed in contention for the first 1,500 meters of the course, alternating between third and fourth place with Germany as Great Britain and Switzerland led the pack.
But in a race where only the top three boats would advance to the A final, a torrid sprint from the Netherlands in lane two left both the Germans and Americans out of contention, as Newell’s boat came in fifth. The Olympics are not over for the USA boat, but the medal chances are. Newell will be racing in the B final on Thursday alongside Germany, the Czech Republic, France, Italy and China.
Yesterday, in women’s basketball action, Temi Fagbenle ’15 and Great Britain missed out on their best chance at winning a game in this, their first ever Olympic basketball competition. After keeping it close against Canada most of the game, the Canadians pulled away in the last minutes of the fourth quarter, getting their first victory in Olympic competition and giving the UK its second loss. The rising sophomore Fagbenle turned in a solid—if not spectacular—performance, registering six points, six rebounds and three assists.
Tomorrow, you can catch Malcolm Howard ’05 and the defending Gold Medalist Canadian eight rowing in the A final of rowing’s most prestigious event, and Brodie Buckland ’06 rowing in the semifinal with his Australian pair. Fagbenle will be back in action, taking on Brazil in Great Britain’s third group game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh wasn’t a suit guy. He’d rather chop wood, sit on his back deck, or above all else, play some ball.
But one day in 1996, Walsh sat in a suit outside of then-Harvard Athletic Director Bill Cleary’s office. After 15 years coaching at Division III Suffolk University, Walsh was hoping to land the Crimson gig.
“He waited outside Bill Cleary’s office until Bill came out so he could say, ‘I really, really want the job,’” said Sandra Walsh, Joe’s wife.
Walsh was shocked when he got the job as Harvard’s first full-time baseball coach.
“At that time he thought, ‘There is no way I’d get that job,’” Sandra said. “He surprised everybody. It was so exciting for him to go from a D-III school to Harvard in the Ivy League. It was kind of like a Cinderella story.”
After living out the happily-ever-after end of his coaching fairy tale for 17 years, Walsh died in his home Tuesday morning at the age of 58. Sandra said that he likely died of a heart attack.
Walsh grew up in West Roxbury and fell in love with baseball at an early age. He attended Catholic Memorial School before playing college ball at Suffolk University in Boston.
Four years after graduating, Walsh became head coach at Suffolk. In 2009, he was inducted to the Suffolk Athletic Hall of Fame in recognition of his 15 years of coaching.
When Walsh came to Harvard, the Crimson had never had a full-time baseball coach. The previous year, Harvard had gone 10-25. In his first year on the job, Walsh turned the program around to guide his squad to a 23-17 finish.
The following year, Walsh won games against powerhouses University of Miami and UCLA, a step towards putting the Ivy League on the national map.
“He was one of the guys that made people across the country say, ‘Ivy League baseball doesn’t suck,’” Yale coach John Stuper said. “I was proud to be an Ivy League coach when he beat UCLA and he beat Miami.”
During 32 years of coaching, Walsh racked up 569 wins, including 347 at Harvard.
“He’s been one of the standard-bearers of our league,” Stuper said.
Stuper credited much of Walsh’s success to in-game tactics.
“He was one of the best in-game coaches that I have coached against,” Stuper said. “And I’ve coached against some big-time people.”
Beyond strategy, Stuper remembered Walsh for his love of the game.
“I remember the first time we played them, we beat them three out of four. And the next day Joe called us and said, ‘Gosh, that was a great series. That was great baseball,’” Stuper said. “If I had lost three out of four, I don’t know if I would have been so effusive in my praise of the other team or how great a weekend it was. He just loved good baseball.”
Stuper recalled Walsh pining for Ivy League teams to play four nine-inning games each weekend, because “in his eyes, that was real baseball.”
He also remembered Walsh’s care for his players, and Sandra said he showed that sort of concern off the diamond as well.
“Just the other day he was on his way to the dump and came home with a turtle in the back of the truck,” she said. “All the other cars whizzed by it, but he stopped so he could take it to the pond.”
Sandra said her husband was devoted to spending his free time with their four daughters, Tory, Holly, Katie, and Kasey. And she has seen the profound effects of his love—for his family, his athletes, and the game—since his passing.
“I’ve been getting a lot of phone calls this morning,” she said. “I have never in my entire life heard so many grown men crying.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The spectacle of the Olympics, if nothing else, can be overwhelming.
“It’s so amazing here that I’m just trying to compartmentalize things,” Esther Lofgren ’07-’09 of the USA women’s eight said. “In some ways, I’m like a wide-eyed kid, just so happy to be here and amazed by everything, and then there’s a part of me I have to bring to the race.”
So far, Lofgren and her boat-mates—including fellow alum Caryn Davies ’04-’05—have been able to do just that, cruising to victory in their heat on Sunday and advancing to Thursday’s A Final. The USA boat is the defending Olympic champion and six-time defending World Champion. Despite coming in as the odds-on favorite and having dominated international competition for the last half-decade, there is an added element of randomness brought about by the magnitude of the Olympic Games.
“In training and competition we tell ourselves that it’s just another race,” Lofgren said. “But it’s not. It’s different, it’s the Olympics. It’s special.”
Though rowing is perhaps more prominent in England than in any other country, the Olympics have brought a new level to the fanfare, and the stands at Eton Dorney have been nearly sold out every day—even in the heat stages.
“On the water, it’s basically the same as a World Championships,” Will Newell ’11 said. “But there’s a whole fan and media presence that I’ve never seen before that is really exciting.”
Lofgren’s Olympic moment will most likely come on Thursday, as the USA remains a favorite for gold. For Davies, it would mean the third medal in as many games, winning Silver in Athens and Gold in Beijing, part of a long and fruitful Olympic career.
For others, like Newell, the London Olympics have ended almost as quickly as they started.
After finishing last in their heat, America’s men’s lightweight four bounced back and won the repechage to earn a spot in the first semi-final Tuesday morning. After staying level for the first 1,500 meters, they faded, finishing fifth and being relegated to the B Final on Thursday.
“Today just wasn’t our day,” Newell said. “We raced our hearts out, and that’s really all you can do. We obviously wanted to make the A final, I mean who doesn’t. Now we just want to do the best that we can in the B final.
Somewhere between the Olympic experiences of Newell and Lofgren lies the experience of Henrik Rummel ’09. Rummel, also in his first Olympics, surprised a number of onlookers as his USA boat—racing together for the first time in international competition—won their heat on Monday in impressive fashion in the men’s four. The four is among the more competitive of all the races at Eton Dorney this week.
“I would say that things have exceeded my expectations so far,” Rummel said. “You can’t let yourself get delusions of grandeur, but we didn’t expect to control and command the race like that in the opening heat.”
Rummel and the American boat will be rowing in a semifinal on Thursday, hoping for a good row and a spot in the A Final. Before the Games, Rummel noted that the untested USA boat was very fast and “ready to surprise some people.” America has not medaled in the coxless four since a silver in the 1992 Barcelona Games.
“We hope to win the race, and I think that if we row to our potential, we can and we will,” Rummel said.
Lofgren’s blockmate while at Harvard was two-time Winter Olympian, hockey player Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08. Before going to London, Lofgren consulted Cahow for advice on how to handle the Olympic spotlight.
“[Cahow] told me to just take it in: when you’re racing, you’re racing, when you’re practicing, you’re practicing, but other than that, just be the little kid you want to be,” Lofgren said. “So I just sit in the dining hall and say ‘Wow, I’m sitting here eating with my heroes. I’m racing at the Olympics. This is what I’ve dreamed about forever.’”

Ah, New York City—so much to see, so much to do, and so many places to go. How you chose to get from place to place may be just as important as where you go. In this miraculously functional city of eight million, we are proud of our various modes of public transportation. So proud, in fact, that we will judge each other and you by the transportation you choose to take.
In a city where cool is currency, and just about anything can be a statement, how will you choose to roll? Lest you get lost in the options, or want to strategize your New Yorker identity, here is a guide to navigating the transportation stereotypes of New York City.
The Taxi-Bourgeoisie
Only the rich, the desperate, or the clueless use taxis as their  primary mode of transportation. Read: owners of multi-million dollar  homes on the Upper East Side, tourists, and…tourists.
The Metro-North Commuter
If you take the Metro-North train into the city, that means one of  two things: You’re either a daily commuter with a full-time job in New  York City, or you’re a thirteen-year-old girl about to see Wicked on  Broadway for the third time. You are also viewed as an outsider. To  those who live in NYC proper, anything north of Fordham is considered  “Upstate.”
The Grand Central Gawker
Grand Central Station is notoriously the busiest commuting hub in  Manhattan, but if you spend longer than four seconds gazing at the high  vaulted ceiling (a gorgeous blue canopy of constellations), you will be  seen as a tourist, labeled as a newb, and an ironic (obnoxious) New  Yorker might well take a photo of you.
The Subway Sampler
Those who favor the subway are down-to-earth inhabitants of NYC in  all of its five-borough glory. These travellers have honed high level  survival skills and subway nous from years of training in learning to  decipher cryptic directions such as “take the N, Q, or R west, transfer  to D, then A, B, or C down until you can’t anymore.”
The Streetwalkers
If you prefer to walk the streets of NYC rather than take public  transportation, chances are, you’re either a health-nut or you’re hoping  that one of the many street-style photographers will fall madly in love  with your sartorial sensibility. Navigating scaffolding, children, and  sweaty underground fumes while keeping up with the New York walking  speed takes dexterity and skill. To do it in style, however, is the  ultimate goal.
The streets of NYC are the place to see and be seen. Study the habits  of the New Yorker, watch what they’re doing, see what they’re  wearing—and no one will be able to tell that you weren’t native. On the  20-block walk from Grand Central to Central Park, there were 51 people  in horizontally striped shirts, and 38 carrying Starbucks cups. It’s  safe to say that stripes are in, and the Starbucks franchise is  flourishing.

There’s a lot to do in New York, and most of it costs an absurd amount of money. But I’m here to tell you that there are free venues where you can have fun and get off the beaten track at the same time. All you need is a metrocard and a sense of adventure. Here are two places that exemplify the way that art and culture in New York is rooted in its neighborhood shops and local artists.
The Brooklyn Museum
Far from the madding crowd of Manhattan is the Brooklyn Museum, home to an eclectic collection of American art and great European works. It feels less organized and more personal than bigger Manhattan museums such as the Met or MoMA. There is a “suggested” eight-dollar entry fee for students, but you can also wander in for free.
Make sure to check out the Brooklyn museum’s year-long “Raw/Cooked” series of art pieces featuring emerging Brooklyn artists. I particularly loved Bedford-based artist Heather Hart’s exhibition: A large-scale structure titled The Eastern Oracle: We Will Tear the Roof Off the Mother. The artwork resembles the roof of a house and its interior contains a recreation of a Buddhist shrine. Visitors are encouraged to interact with the installation; climbing on top of the house and walking inside to press gold leaf onto the wall of the shrine.
Also drop by the Keith Haring exhibit, a temporary showcase of the young artist’s works. The exhibit includes a thirty-foot wall painting, newspaper collages, and “Painting Myself into a Corner,” a video of Haring doing just that, while another man reads a nonsensical story about circles.
Steinway Hall
Another free adventure is Steinway Hall on 57th street in Manhattan. Ostensibly, visitors come in to purchase a Steinway piano, but many also come simply to admire the rotunda ceiling designed by the famed Warren and Wetmore architecture firm. Whitney Warren (1864-1943) and Charles D. Wetmore (1866-1941) were responsible for many of New York’s grandest and most prolific buildings in the three decades leading to the Great Depression. Their body of work includes the Grand Central Terminal, mansions for Manhattan’s elite, and the New York Yacht Club.
The best part of Steinway Hall, for me personally, are the many rooms of Steinway, Essex, and Boston pianos––perfectly tuned and brand new––that are available to be tested out by awe-struck music lovers.

On a Tuesday night, I found myself in the Bowery neighborhood of downtown New York. An atypical night of the week to be out and about perhaps, but not, it seems, for the underground-music-loving, tight-denim-wearing set that flocked to the Bowery for a heady dose of indie and art.
Following a recommendation, some friends and I wound up at an album release listening party for the band Pop Etc (formerly known as The Morning Benders).
The party was held at a Bowery art gallery called The Hole that was well known for its quirky exhibitions and frequent events. I’d never been to a listening party before, but the name implied much of what we did—we listened.
Self-titled Pop Etc, the album was considered by the band to be part of the “pop and more than pop” genre. Pop Etc’s music heavily featured synthetic sounds, but an accompanying haunting falsetto brought humanity to an otherwise impersonal tone. Each song was intricately layered such that every portion was equally important.
The music played while we wandered around the gallery, which displayed portraits of over 100 local artists, representing faces of New York’s art community. It was an enjoyable 40 minutes of listening, but it was even more fun for me and my friends to yell at each other over the music when we wanted to comment on the odd artwork on the walls.
Most people cleared out after the album played through, but we stuck around to talk to the band members, Chris Chu, Jon Chu, and Julian Harmon. Appropriate perhaps given the venue, they were eager to discuss with us the details of their lives as artists––from the types of film camera they used to the contents of their blog.  .
We eventually left the Pop Etc party in search of food. A short walk took us to Tacombi, makers of delicious and great-value tacos.Tacombi’s set-up was as unusual and charming as the listening party: the tiny kitchen was inside a stationary VW beetle, and the seating was in a crowded warehouse.
After the late dinner, I dragged my friends through the city downpour to a Turkish diner so that we could all share some of the sweetest baklavah in New York City.
And so the night ended, on a sweet note. Despite the fact that we were a bit wet and bedraggled, that our feet ached from impractical footwear, and that “pop and more than pop” remained a mysterious genre; we had experienced a great night at the Bowery, one filled with music, art, and food. It was delightful to experience the neighborhood––a lively, quirky place, that promised more magical nights to come.
