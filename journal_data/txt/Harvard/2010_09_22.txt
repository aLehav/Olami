After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many at Harvard—and now, around the world—are misconstruing what's really at stake in whether the Standing Committee on Social Studies accepts a research fund in the name of “New Republic” editor-in-chief and long-time Harvard donor and instructor Martin H. Peretz.
What's at stake is not Peretz's First Amendment right to say things about Muslims that even he admits were wrong. Nor does it matter whether his apology was sincere. Harvard has been through bigotry-cleansing rituals many times, but diehard defenders of former president Lawrence H. Summers are wrong to claim that the Harvard Corporation ousted him only because a politically correct faculty was outraged by his insensitivity to African-Americans and women.
Nor is this really about left versus right. The columnist David Brooks noted cutely in 2002, "American society has decided to warehouse its radical lunatics on university campuses in specialized departments that operate as nunneries for the perpetually alienated." But now it’s failed, aging, neo-con fellow-travelers, disgraced by their own blunders in foreign policy and other realms, who are craving academic honors and scurrying into lavishly funded nunneries the likes of which few leftists ever enjoy.
What’s truly at stake, and not only at Harvard, is the defense of liberal education against subtle degradation by college administrators’ and donors’ increasing bestowals of quasi-academic distinction upon people who've bought or wormed their ways into campus sinecures for questionable personal and political reasons, as Peretz has done.
He has already endowed a Martin Peretz Chair in Yiddish Literature in his own name, and that is enough. There are excellent, even urgent, reasons why donors should be recognized only by name and otherwise unheard, in a university’s life.
Yet liberal education, beleaguered ideologically and financially, is seeing an explosion of purchased "scholarly” honors for interlopers: Yale’s “Studies in Grand Strategy Program” has commended to its undergraduates the likes of "Diplomat in Residence" Charles Hill, chief foreign-policy adviser to Rudy W. Giuliani's 2008 presidential campaign, even though Hill addresses students mainly as the foreign service officer he was until the Iran-Contra independent counsel made him a diplomat-in-exile him from Washington.
The Yale program has added John D. Negroponte, former Bush national intelligence director and Reagan Administration ambassador to Honduras when torture was American policy there. And now retired General Stanley A. McChrystal has signed on to teach undergraduates as well as graduates for several semesters at Yale's new Jackson Institute for Global Affairs.
What matters isn’t these men's unwise and perhaps revealing utterances—such as Peretz's against Muslims or McChrystal's against Obama -- but the creeping legitimizing of their pedagogy and what it portends for liberal education.
Colleges like Harvard and Yale do need to strike a delicate balance between humanist truth-seeking and republican power-wielding as they train national and global leaders through liberal education. They should make room for people with “real world” experience to teach one course a year, as I do at Yale and Peretz does at Harvard, as part of the campus mix, provided we meet the standards of a liberal education. But what we don’t deserve are academic honors and institutional power based on worldly presence and “connections” or wealth, not on scholarship.
Peretz is no more scholarly or subtle than Yale's Charles Hill and no less craving of the balm of scholarly credibility and prestige that neither of them has earned. Their student defenders and apologists may not understand fully what is being done to them here as students. Their student critics may over-emphasize specific instances of bigotry like Peretz's or past blunders like McChrystal's or Negroponte's.
To its credit, Yale's Grand Strategy program, stung or enlightened by criticism, has brought in the writer Jonathan E. Schell ’65 and the PBS economics correspondent Paul Solman to present understandings of power and wealth at odds with those posited and peddled by the program throughout the Bush years.
Harvard's Standing Committee on Social Studies has an easier task: not to let the power-and-money and public-relations virus infect its program via honoring Peretz, who has done nothing to deserve such a distinction. I'd go so far as to second the Massachusetts Bay Puritan minister Richard Mather, who said in 1657, "Imposters have but seldom got in and set up among us; and when they have done so, they have made a short blaze and gone out in a snuff."
So one might hope now, too. But these days liberal education and wise leadership, like Christianity and free markets, have a lot more noisy claimants and celebrants than they have true friends. A fund named for Peretz would cleanse neither him nor Harvard or its failures to get this balance right. It should be named instead for a distinguished educator such as Stanley Hoffman, Barrington Moore, or Nathan Glazer, not for an operator with political agendas who craves an academic distinction he’s never earned.
Jim Sleeper, EdD ’77, a lecturer in political science at Yale, taught Expository writing at Harvard in the mid-1970s and was a Shorenstein Fellow at the Kennedy School in 1998.
Editors' Note: This op-ed has been revised from its original version, which had referred incorrectly to Minh A. Luong, instructor in computer espionage and associate director of Yale University's "Studies in Grand Strategy Program."  In 2007, Mr. Luong received a doctorate in business administration from California Pacific University.  The Crimson has no evidence that he has claimed to have a Ph.D., nor that Yale University has questioned his credentials.  For several years, he served as the Forrest Mars, Sr. Visiting Professor of Ethics, Politics, and Economics at Yale. According to Mr. Luong and Yale's Public Information Office, he correctly identified himself as such publicly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When he leaves the office for the day, my father, who works as an attorney in East Tennessee, stops in a gas station to buy a Coke. Often he waits in line at the cash register behind truckers, construction workers, and other blue-collar employees, who work much harder than him for less pay. Rather than investing their hard-earned money, many of them come straight from the job site to the gas station to buy lottery tickets.
The same unfortunate display can be witnessed in the 43 states that sponsor lotteries as a source of revenue. Massachusetts, which participates in two multi-state lotteries and administers several intrastate games, raised a whopping $903 million in fiscal year 2010 from about $4.4 billion in ticket sales. This represents an increase over recent years, when profits were already well above the national average. Based on data from the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries and U.S. Census estimates, the commonwealth sold $725 worth of lottery tickets per capita in fiscal year 2008, turning the sixth highest nationwide profit of $140 per capita.
The Massachusetts State Lottery, like those of other states, produces an enormous amount of revenue because of its monopoly status: The government administers the public lottery and prohibits private lotteries. This lack of competition explains why the state is able to retain about 21 percent of the money from ticket sales. In other words, if you buy a lottery ticket in Massachusetts, you pay your share of the prizes and operating costs, plus 26 percent of that amount in the form of an implicit tax to the state government.
But you won’t find this tax printed on the receipt.  That’s because Massachusetts, like other states, doesn’t acknowledge that the lottery tax is, well, a tax. Proponents of lotteries claim the money that accrues to the government from ticket sales shouldn’t be considered a “tax,” which is a mandatory payment to the government, since purchasing lottery tickets is voluntary.
If the revenue derived from the lottery isn’t a tax, it’s a very good imitation. Proceeds from the Massachusetts Lottery are distributed among cities and towns to be used as general revenue, benefiting citizens at large—not just those who purchase tickets.  While playing the lottery is indeed voluntary, so is the purchase of any product, including luxury goods, on which Massachusetts levies a general sales tax of 6.25 percent. The government’s refusal to label the lottery tax a “tax,” then, amounts to a political ploy to keep people from realizing they are paying a tax.
Semantics aside, the problem with this method of fundraising is that it disproportionately affects the poor. While little data is available for Massachusetts specifically, virtually all the academic literature on lottery taxes concludes that they are regressive, meaning the poor pay a greater share of their income than the wealthy. Studies often find that the poor actually pay more than the rich as a dollar amount. Duke University’s Dr. Philip J. Cook, the leading researcher on Congress’s National Gambling Impact Study Commission in the late 1990s, remarked that the implicit tax on lotteries is “the most regressive tax we know.” The commission estimated that in 1997, high school dropouts spent four times as much on lottery tickets as college graduates, blacks spent five times as much as whites, and players making less than $10,000 spent more than any other income group at an estimated $597 per year—almost six percent of their income. A 2008 Carnegie Mellon study found that about half of households making under $25,000 a year play the lottery, among which the annual per capita expenditure is greater than $550.
Bolstering these data is the inordinate number of lottery outlets in poor neighborhoods.  In a 2004 analysis of the Powerball game in neighboring Connecticut, Emily F. Oster ’02, then a Harvard graduate student, concluded that at a jackpot of $10 million, the poorest 20 percent of zip codes would contribute about 25 percent of sales, and the richest 20 percent about 20 percent of sales. Oster found that regressivity decreases as prize amounts increase and extrapolated that a jackpot of $806 million would likely be needed to make the implicit tax progressive. The record for the two multi-state lotteries is $390 million; the vast majority of jackpots are a fraction of this, and the prizes for all but one of the intrastate games are less than $1 million.
While lack of research precludes a definitive answer, circumstantial evidence indicates that the implicit tax on the Massachusetts lottery is highly regressive. Communities might raise the same amount of money by increasing property taxes. Alternatively, the state could increase the income tax or the sales tax and transfer the proceeds to cities and towns. Any of these options would be far less regressive than the lottery tax. What’s more, they would spread tax incidence over the entire population rather than requiring a fraction of disproportionately poor citizens to finance government services for everyone. In conjunction with this, the state could earn a one-time profit by selling the public lottery to the private sector, and allow competition from other firms to reduce ticket prices.
Above all, the lottery debate needs a dose of transparency. Policymakers should make the lottery tax explicit, and acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns about its redistributive consequences. Only then will reform be possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A great teacher is invaluable to a student’s education. At Harvard, we are privileged to be taught by world-renowned professors—the leaders in their fields—and as students we are encouraged to explore our interests and pursue the passions that our teachers excite in us. After graduating, we have the opportunity to share what we have learned and apply it in classrooms with new enthusiasm and perspective. Harvard students are already keen to this trend. Two hundred and ninety-three seniors in the 2010 graduating class, nearly 17 percent, applied to Teach for America, one of a number of teaching programs offered to recent college graduates. Harvard students should continue this new trend of demonstrating a commitment to educating others.
Programs like Teach for America and the Harvard Undergraduate Teacher Education Program offer recent graduates a unique opportunity to get a firsthand look into the American education system as well as providing students in low-income areas with the chance to have a fresh and motivated instructor. While these programs are usually only two years long, they give recent graduates a feeling for what life would be like inside the classroom, which can help them decide if this type of work would suit them in the long run.
Harvard had more graduates than ever before apply to TFA in 2009 and yielded the greatest percentage of TFA hires out of all colleges in the country. This attitude toward teaching should be commended and maintained in the future, as America has a clearly demonstrated need for additional qualified instructors. For those international students who wish to address educational disparities and inequities in their home countries, they can give back some of what their Harvard education has given them by joining teaching programs around the world.
First-hand teaching experience out of college has sparked a desire in many graduates to devote careers to helping improve educational inequity, starting with the recruitment and retention of passionate, quality teachers. Esteemed professionals in the education sector who began with Teach for America include Michelle A. Rhee, Chancellor of the District of Columbia Schools, who was a member of the Baltimore ’92 corps, and Chris Barbic, founder of YES College Preparatory Schools who was a Houston ’92 corps member.
Although the grim job market and the chance to add a program like TFA to a resume may tempt graduating seniors to pursue an interim career in teaching, this job exploration should still be encouraged, regardless of the motives behind the application. We hope that students will continue to consider it viable post-graduation employment even when the job market improves.
For those students who do not wish to dedicate two years to teaching after college, possibly because they are unsure of what the experience will entail, opportunities for teaching while still in college abound. The Phillips Brooks House Association offers undergraduates numerous ways to get experience in the classroom with programs in after school tutoring, and many others. Students can teach in classrooms all over the world during the summer or can teach at-risk children in inner-city schools through PBHA’s Summer Urban Program.
Whether or not Harvard students are interested in teaching as a career, experience in the classroom and the opportunity to engage kids provides both a service to underprivileged children and a learning experience to new teachers themselves. While the saying may go, “Those who can’t do, teach,” Harvard students are proving just the opposite. “Those who can do, teach,” and hopefully that trend is here to stay.

In the latest bout of an ongoing tussle for a State Senate seat that began in January, Democratic contender Timothy R. Flaherty has filed paperwork asking for a partial recount of votes cast in last Tuesday’s primary.
On the evening of the primary last week, Flaherty called his opponent Sal N. DiDomenico to concede, Flaherty’s spokeswoman Dorie R. Clark told The Crimson at the time.
Yesterday, however, the State House News Service reported that Flaherty had asked for a recount of some votes cast in Everett, DiDomenico’s hometown—and that the city will recount its ballots at 8 a.m. on Saturday, in a process open to public viewing.
Clark confirmed that Flaherty requested a recount in Everett but told The Crimson that the Flaherty campaign no longer desires the recount to take place.  She stated, “Paperwork was initially filed but we are not presently requesting a recount,” and refused to elaborate further.
About 76 percent of voters in Everett cast their ballots for DiDomenico, who previously served as a City Councillor in the town.
In contrast, Flaherty, a Cambridge lawyer, took the majority of the votes in the parts of Boston, Cambridge, Revere, and Somerville that fall into the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex Senate district. Though he won Chelsea by 20 votes and Saugus by 117, DiDomenico’s presumptive victory rests heavily on his performance in Everett, the source of 46 percent of his total votes.
Overall, DiDomenico beat Flaherty by 190 votes out of 13,828 cast, according to unofficial tallies released by the Boston Globe.
In April, both men ran for the same seat in a special primary, after former State Senator Anthony D. Galluccio resigned the seat upon his imprisonment in January. Of the six candidates in April’s Democratic primary, DiDomenico emerged victorious, edging out runner-up Flaherty by about 135 votes.
Flaherty requested a recount on the night of the April primary but renounced that demand four days later. Instead, he said, he would run against DiDomenico again when the seat came up for reelection in the fall, following a normal election timetable. The victorious Democrat, presumably DiDomenico, will face Republican candidate Barbara T. Bush in the November general election.

Several Ethical Reasoning classes—some of which would not have fit within the Core’s Moral Reasoning category—have proven surprisingly popular this semester.
A prime example is Slavic Languages and Literature Professor Justin M. Weir’s new course Ethical Reasoning 28: “Moral Inquiry in the Novels of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky,” which saw enrollment skyrocket from an anticipated 40 students to 105 this fall.
On the first day, students crowded into the appointed lecture hall, crammed into window seats, and spilled into the hallway to get a taste of Weir’s class. The course’s sustained popularity led to a change of venue—it is now held in Yenching Auditorium.
“I sort of figured that even though I like Russian writers, they’re not exactly the most popular people in the world,” said Garrett E. Morton ’13, a student in the class. “But there are a lot of other people here who thought a literary bent on ethical reasoning would be fun.”
Whereas most Moral Reasoning classes analyzed philosophical texts, this class uses writing from a different field—literature—to approach the discussion of ethics.
“The two authors offer different perspectives on all the big timeless questions about happiness, the good life, political obligation, faith in a God and so forth,” Weir said. “But they also consider questions that remain politically relevant today.”
While the differences between the Core’s Moral Reasoning category and Gen Ed’s Ethical Reasoning one may seem ambiguous, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said that there is a fairly clear distinction: Ethical Reasoning includes a broader range of classes, allowing students to grapple with philosophy through diverse lenses (like Russian literature) and historical perspectives. It also permits an emphasis on applied ethics, he said.
“The goal [of adjusting the category] was simply to acknowledge the reality that there are multiple ways to enter the discussion about situating oneself ethically in life,” Harris said.
Philosophy Professor Thomas M. Scanlon, Jr. said it seems to him that “if there is a difference, it’s more in how the requirement is being administered than how it actually looks on paper.”
Both categories, Scanlon said, aim to make students think critically about questions of right and wrong, but the context in which these questions are discussed is less restricted under Ethical Reasoning.
Harris said other current Ethical Reasoning courses that would not have fit the Moral Reasoning description include Ethical Reasoning 26: “The Ethics of Atheism: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud,” and Ethical Reasoning 24: “Bioethics,” both of which will be offered in the spring.
Even courses which counted for Moral Reasoning before have seen high enrollments this year. Ethical Reasoning 18: “Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Theory” increased from 336 students last fall to 401 this year, necessitating its relocation to Sanders Theatre. Additionally, Ethical Reasoning 21: “Moral Reasoning About Social Protest” has an enrollment of 174.
One class with a slightly smaller enrollment this year (805 versus 872 in 2008/2009) is Government professor Michael J. Sandel’s Ethical Reasoning 22: “Justice.” However, Harris said this could have many causes beyond extended Ethical Reasoning options.
“The other three ER courses are all very popular, and that’s got to be a piece of the answer,” he said. “Perhaps, in addition, the dissemination of the course’s materials in various formats has had an impact.”
All that said, Harris added, “Justice” still has the highest enrollment in the College.

Franklin & Marshall College became the newest member of the National Campaign for Political and Civic Engagement—a program established by the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics aiming to increae student interest in politics on college campuses—last week.
The 22 schools in the consortium, which includes Harvard College as well as state universities, will participate in a “sharing of ideas,” said Laura Simolaris, Director of National Youth Engagement at Harvard.
Franklin & Marshall was invited to join the consortium because it was “already doing good work around civic engagement on [its] campus and in general,” Simolaris said.
F  & M Votes is a center at Franklin & Marshall that promotes  voter registration, education, and motivation.
On Harvard’s campus, the National Campaign runs Harvard Voter Outreach and Turnout Effort, referred to as H-Vote, to increase voter registration and activism, especially during election years.
On Study Card Day, the National Campaign registered Harvard freshmen in University Hall and upperclassmen in their respective Houses. Throughout the semester, they will remind students of voting deadlines, as well as give them information about how to register for absentee ballots, said Liesl J. Newton ’11.
“The whole purpose is to create,” said Madonna, “What I like about the program is that it is designed to try to bring about life-long commitment to this kind of service, whether it’s civic engagement, or more general, like community work or political work.”

The faculty members affiliated with Harvard Computer Science are poised to face a wave of retirement over the next few years—a trend that is likely to lead to considerable hiring of new CS professors as well as the development of expertise within the Computer Science subfields of computation and modeling.
According to School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Communications Director Michael P. Rutter, six of the 18 active or tenured faculty affiliated with CS at Harvard are over the age of 60.
The proportion of over-60 faculty in CS slightly higher than the corresponding proportion for SEAS overall, which Dean of SEAS Cherry A. Murray said was about 30 percent during an All-Hands Meeting last spring. At that time, Murray called for the faculty to grow “reasonably quickly” in order to ensure that new professors were hired “before the [older] faculty retire.”
According to Rutter, Harvard CS has responded to this need for renewal by being particularly vigorous in training and tenuring junior faculty. Five of the nine total promotions to tenure in SEAS within the past five years have gone to professors affiliated with CS, though only about one in four full-time-equivalent faculty members in SEAS are affiliated with the field. In addition, one-third of the junior hires at SEAS in the past 10 years have also been affiliated with CS or with CS and electrical engineering.
Yet according to Computer Science Area Dean Michael D. Mitzenmacher, Harvard Computer Science will be launching a search for another faculty member in the next few weeks, and will continue to be looking for new talent both to replace retiring faculty and to increase the overall number of CS professors.
“I’d like to see us grow to 25 to 30 faculty eventually, but my guess is that that will be a decade-long process, or more,” Mitzenmacher said.
Mitzenmacher added that these searches hoped to attract “the most talented people, but also people who can focus on not just a narrow area, but who can focus on the opportunities Harvard offers to branch out.”
But Murray said that she is specifically hoping to bring in more CS theorists among the group of new hires. This hiring trend would counteract the imbalance created by the departure of the current batch of senior faculty, many of whom are theoretical computer scientists.
Murray also said that she is looking to bolster the area’s reputation in several computer science subfields.
“We need more computational faculty,” Murray said, adding that computation and simulation are becoming a “third leg” of science.
CS Lecturer David J. Malan said the CS area should not change dramatically with these replacements, but he added that “the introduction of younger faculty certainly breeds newer ideas to the department.”

Psychology Professor Steven Pinker explored the history, psychology, and philosophy of violence in a lecture held last night at William James Hall.
The lecture, “A History of Violence,” presented the project he worked on during a sabbatical last semester—a new book asserting a decline in violence in recent human history.
In his discussion, Pinker said that we are actually living in a historically unprecedented time of peace—a fact he said most people overlook.
“Everyone is appalled by violence but few are aware whether [now] is more or less violent than other times,” he said.
Although Pinker said that it was unlikely that modern humans had lost their “vicarious” fascination with violence, he suggested that historical developments have led to reduced violence: for example, the rise of states led to the elimination of judicial torture during the Enlightenment, and in an age of globalized trade, countries are less likely to attack other nations with whom they have strong economic ties.
Finally, Pinker elaborated upon the “Expanding Circle,” the idea that humans have evolved to feel empathy and that the scope of this empathy has expanded due to globalization and progress in human reason.
The evening concluded with a roundtable discussion with Pinker over dinner.
Students engaged him further about his work, prompting discussion about the humanization of war, the role of gender in the psychological perception of violence, and the impact of frequent violence in mainstream entertainment and media.
Pinker’s lecture was part of an ongoing series of seminars, teas, and dinner discussions hosted by the Harvard Society for Mind, Brain, and Behavior.
Richard J. Sima ’12, academic event co-chair of HSMBB and organizer of the event, said that Pinker was a “logical choice” for furthering HSMBB’s goal of exposing as many students as possible to the diverse and cutting edge research occurring in the Mind, Brain, and Behavior field.
“He’s done great work on how language shapes us and started studying violence because it was a great way to study human nature,” Sima said. “Tonight made me an optimist. There’s other bad stuff, but this is promising!”
Joanna Y. Li ’12, a neurobiology concentrator, said that she attended not just because “He’s Steven Pinker!” but also due to her interest in the subject.
“It’s an interesting point to make that there’s a disjunct between how much violence people think there is and how much there actually is,” Li said.

One week after Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid introduced the possibility of the DREAM Act making its way to the Senate floor this week, the legislation failed to see a final vote yesterday in the Senate due to a Republican filibuster.
The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act would have provided qualified undocumented youth with a six-year conditional path to citizenship upon the completion of two years of higher education or two years of military service.
The immigration bill was attached to a larger defense resolution that included a repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy currently banning openly gay individuals from serving in the military. With a vote of 60 required, the cloture motion failed to pass with a vote of 56 to 43.
Over the past few months, the University as well as several student organizations on and off campus have rallied in support of the legislation that would provide amnesty to students who immigrated illegally to the United States.
On Monday, University President Drew G. Faust co-signed a letter to Massachusetts state senators with seven other leaders of institutions of higher education in the state, requesting support of the DREAM Act.
Student groups, such as Harvard College Act on a Dream and the Student Immigrant Movement of Massachusetts have made hundreds of phone calls to state Senators to tell them to vote in favor of the DREAM Act.
In May 2009, Faust wrote a letter in support of the legislation to Mass. Rep. Michael E. Capuano.
Faust also met with Mass. Senator Scott P. Brown, in part to urge him to support the DREAM Act.
Brown, who has remained ambivalent on his position in relation to the legislation, voted against the defense resolution and the appended DREAM Act yesterday.
“As a group we are just going to continue to move forward,” said Act on a Dream Co-Director Melissa V. Perez ’13. “The enthusiasm demonstrated by the Senate, President Drew Faust, the federal relations office, and the University as a whole has proved that we have abundant support in our decision to continue.”
Colette S. Perold ’11, a member of the Student Immigration Movement, echoed similar sentiments of continuing the fight despite the setback.
“This was one shot to get the DREAM Act passed, but there’s a lot of shots out there,” Perold said.
“There’s been a general consensus in the press that student and immigrant activists are the reason why Reid put this on the floor... and that just means we’re stronger than ever, and we have to keep going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The petition started by one Harvard junior calling for Harvard University Hospitality & Dining Services to serve less meat is quickly getting support and getting noticed.
Since it was posted online last Tuesday, the petition has garnered 184 signatures from students across campus—and HUHDS is taking notice.
“We have long supported similar House-based student meatless initiatives by carefully monitoring student consumption and demand, and when the success of this effort warrants it, shifting the menu as appropriate, said HUHDS spokeswoman Crista Martin in an emailed statement. “At any meal, providing choice for diverse students’ tastes is an important component of our menus and program.”
Martin also noted that one-third of HUHDS daily entrée options are meatless and are offered along with other grill, salad, and deli bar options.
But Talia B. Lavin ’12, the originator of the campaign, is determined to effect a substantial change in HUHDS’ menu offerings by gathering at least 500 signatures for her petition, a number she says will “make HUHDS sit up and listen.”
Despite the number of people who have expressed support for a less meat-heavy HUHDS menu, many still remain unconvinced that this petition is the right approach to reducing meat consumption at Harvard.
“In principle there is no reason we shouldn’t support it,” Byran N. Dai ’11 said, noting the environmental and health benefits of consuming less meat. He added, however, that “eating less meat is a decision each of us should come to by ourselves.”
But Lavin, who has encountered some criticisms of the petition, argued that because HUHDS already selects what food is offered in dining halls, the dining environment created is already one of artificial choice.
“Choices made in the dining hall where everything is bought for you is not the same as a choice made in a free marketplace,” Lavin explained. “Individual preference matters less than the scale of the impact.”
Arguments over choice aside, Lavin noted that we already have multiple entrees of meat served in a single meal, so that reducing our meat consumption would have a significant effect on the environment. “Sometimes you’ll have chicken and beef at the same meal,” Lavin noted, “Who needs to eat chicken and beef in one meal?”

Former University President Lawrence H. Summers will return to Harvard after stepping down from his Washington position at the end of 2010, according to a statement released by the White House.
Summers has decided to resign from position because he has to return to the University within two years after going on leave in order to avoid losing tenure, according to a report in The New York Times.
Summers, who emerged as one of President Barack Obama’s closest economic advisers during the presidential campaign, has played a key role in crafting economic policy during the most severe economic downturn since the Great Depression as head of the National Economic Council.
“Over the past two years, he has helped guide us from the depths of the worst recession since the 1930s to renewed growth,” Obama said in a statement. “And while we have much work ahead to repair the damage done by the recession, we are on a better path thanks in no small measure to Larry’s wise counsel.”
Summers will continue to advise Obama as a member of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board.
“I’m looking forward to returning to Harvard to teach and write about the economic fundamentals of job creation and stable finance as well as the integration of rising and developing countries into the global system,” Summers said in a statement.
It is unclear what courses Summers will teach in the spring—he taught at the Harvard Kennedy School before leaving for Washington—but economics faculty are already anticipating his contribution.
“It’s great news for Harvard; I think it’s good news for Larry; I’m not sure it’s good news for the country. I think President Obama will have an impossible time replacing him and I expect he won’t try,” said Richard J. Zeckhauser, professor of political economy at the Kennedy School.
Summers has been at the center of economic policy making over the past year, serving as the head of the task force that oversaw last year’s bailout of the auto industry. He also structured large portions of the $787 billion stimulus act.
As a result, Summers has been tied to unpopular economic policies, many of which—like the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act—helped end the economic contraction but have become politically unpopular as the current administration faces a backlash against the dramatic actions it took to bolster the economy.
At Harvard, Summers’ five-year presidency was marred by controversies, feuding with prominent scholar Cornel West and supporting economics Professor Andrei Shleifer amidst a federal lawsuit for alleged financial misconduct.
Though perpetually popular with undergraduates, Summers received a vote of no-confidence from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in 2005, a step that led to his 2006 resignation.
After leaving Mass. Hall, Summers took a one-year sabbatical before returning, then left again in 2009 to join Obama’s economic team.
“Larry Summers is one of a number of distinguished Harvard faculty who took leave to serve the government, continuing a long tradition of public service by Harvard faculty,” said Harvard spokesman Kevin Galvin. “We look forward to his return.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on Degrees in Social Studies will inaugurate a $650,000 undergraduate research fund in honor of former Harvard professor Martin “Marty” H. Peretz at the concentration’s fiftieth anniversary celebration this Saturday, according to an official statement released by the Social Studies Standing Committee late last night. Peretz has been embroiled in controversy following a blog post in which he referred to Muslim life as “cheap.”
This official statement represents the conclusion of a heated five-day debate in which over 550 people—including Social Studies concentrators, alumni, and staff members as well as presidents of student support groups—have petitioned against hosting Peretz and accepting the fund. The statement was supposed to be sent out Monday.
Critics of the fund, which is supported by donations from former students and colleagues of Peretz, issued their own statement in response an hour after the official statement, cautioning that the “legacy of bigotry will be remembered as one of the most shameful in the history of Harvard University.”
Signed by President of the Harvard Islamic Society Abdelnasser Rashid ’11-’12 and petition organizer and Social Studies concentrator Simon L. Sternin ’01, the statement noted that the Unversity is acting out of line with its previous actions by accepting the fund. In 2004, Harvard declined the $2.5 million donation of Shaykh Zayed al-Nahyan, the former president of the United Arab Emirates who founded a think tank that has been linked to extremist speakers.
“We call upon [University] President Drew Gilpin Faust, who has yet to find time in her schedule to meet with Muslim students, to reverse this decision and send a strong signal that Harvard is not for sale to bigotry,” the statement read.
“She’s the voice that people look to see what the University’s decision on this is,” Sternin said.
Yet Faust announced her approval of the Social Studies department’s decision at her interview with Visiting Fellow Charlie Gibson at Sanders Theater yesterday, saying that the donors “wished to recognize the ways in which [Peretz] contributed as a teacher to their lives.”
“So it was their wish to contribute to undergraduate research and to recognize the importance of undergraduate research,” Faust said. “That wish seems to us an entirely appropriate basis for a gift.”
Many Social Studies concentrators disagreed.
“For a department that teaches the theory of moral principles, this seems like a prime opportunity to actually practice some of them,” Social Studies concentrator Krishna M. Prabhu ’11 said.
The official committee statement argued that a group of graduates who have worked towards “freedom and equality” and “social causes” could not “harbor within it any form of racial, religious, or other cultural prejudice.”
The statement reaffirmed that Peretz will be “recognized and have the opportunity to make some brief remarks” as a former Social Studies head tutor.
The statement said that while the committee is opposed to Peretz’s controversial remarks, it will use the fund donated in his name to support undergraduates studying topics “such as the study of intercultural understanding, inequality, and social justice.”
Director of Studies Anya Bernstein declined to comment further.
According to Sternin, dialogue with the committee has been sparse—the last time that he has received any response from them was weeks ago.
“Apparently, they’re talking to their donors but they haven’t been talking to the 550 of us,” Sternin said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After leading the University’s largest school through a trying process of closing a $220 million deficit since 2008, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith said yesterday that he plans to focus on academic issues going forward.
In an interview with The Crimson yesterday, Smith said that he will outline his academic priorities and review the state of FAS finances at the first Faculty meeting of the semester on Oct. 6. He declined to specify the nature of his renewed priorities before the upcoming gathering, but said that he plans to focus on “teaching and learning.”
The recent $35 million deficit projection is still at the fore of Smith’s priorities, he said, but the coming year would move away from an environment defined by budget-strapping and focus on opportunities to revisit goals that had preceded the financial crisis.
“I had priorities when I started as dean,” said Smith, who assumed the deanship in July 2007. A year and a half later, the University announced that its endowment had lost 30 percent of its value in the wake of the financial downturn.
Because the crisis hit so soon after he took the helm, Smith’s original priorities fell by the wayside and he has spent the years since working to bridge FAS’s nearly quarter-billion dollar deficit through measures such as staff reductions and hiring restrictions. The school has now closed $185 million of the $220 million deficit announced in the spring of 2008.
And at the upcoming Faculty meeting, Smith will deliver the first budgetary update to the community since its last meeting in the spring. But Smith said that he does not plan to reverse the reduction in staff positions and other changes that FAS has made over the past year and a half.
“I think the vast majority of the changes...that we made across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have actually been beneficial,” Smith said. “That’s not to say they haven’t been painful.”
Despite the progress in closing the financial gap, FAS continues to face a tight budget, Smith said: “We’re not going to staff back up to where we were before because we can’t afford those types of changes.”
The pace of faculty hiring will also remain depressed from its pre-crisis levels. Smith said that the number of hires this year will mirror the number from last year, when FAS sought to fill 31 faculty positions.
But Smith said he expects to be able to turn his attention to earlier priorities, such as “teaching and learning.” That issue was raised in a Jan. 2007 report by the Task Force on Teaching and Career Development that presented a critical view of pedagogy at Harvard and laid out a series of reforms.
The report, which recommended that the University focus on teaching and advising, called for the administration to “commit the necessary resources and leadership to back up our efforts.”

The man who shot himself on the steps of Memorial Church Saturday morning had published online a 1,905-page document entitled “Suicide Note,” according to his mother.
The death of Mitchell L. Heisman, a 35-year-old Somerville resident, on campus was met with shock, and University officials described the incident as “tragic.”
“It’s really sad, it was horrible, and these kinds of incidents affect all of us really negatively,” Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in an interview yesterday. “This campus is situated in an urban context, and we can’t control these kinds of things.”
Born in New York City in 1975, Heisman attended elementary school in Monroe Township, N.J., and graduated with a bachelor’s in psychology from the University of Albany.
While living in a Craigie Street apartment, Heisman wrote “Suicide Note,” a sprawling series of arguments that touch upon historical, religious, and nihilist themes, his mother said.
“He didn’t show me that this was at all what he had in his mind. All I knew was he was finishing his book and he was happy about that,” said his mother Lonni Heisman, 76.
Heisman said she supported publishing her son’s name in The Crimson to let people know of his work “because that’s what he wanted.”
An avid reader interested in mathematics and science, Heisman visited Harvard libraries and may have contacted professors while writing the document, his mother said.
A University spokesman was unable to confirm whether Heisman had reached out to Harvard faculty last night.
The document references Harvard and research done by Harvard faculty—such as Law School professor Alan M. Dershowitz, government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53, and psychology professor Steven Pinker—more than half a dozen times.
Heisman discusses death at length in the piece, which is publicly available online.
Heisman committed suicide on the top step of Memorial Church Saturday in front of a tour group of more than 20 people, according to a Cambridge Police Department report.
His death took place during Yom Kippur services that morning and resulted in campus security shutting down the eastern half of Harvard Yard for much of the day.
Jared L. Nathanson, a 37-year-old singer who described himself as Heisman’s acquaintance, said he had had conversations with Heisman about art, music, and movies.
Nathanson received a copy of “Suicide Note” in an e-mail that day.
“From what I understood of him, his book was very important to him,” Nathanson said.
Heisman worked in several bookstores in the area and relied on an inheritance from his father Alvin Heisman—who passed away while Mitchell Heisman was still an adolescent—to support his writing, according to his mother.
But he was reluctant to talk to her about its contents, she said.
“I’m devastated. I just can’t believe it,” she said. “I don’t think I ever will.”
She spoke with Heisman just two days before his death, she said.
“I expected him to come here to help me move, which I am in the process of,” she said. “I expected him to come back in October. He really was non-committal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust declined to offer details on the future of Harvard’s expansion in Allston or its long-delayed capital campaign in a sweeping, sometimes tense interview with Charles Gibson in Sanders Theatre yesterday.
Faust revealed that the University would accept a controversial donation in the name of former professor Martin Peretz, defending the decision by separating his legacy as a teacher from his recent, heavily criticized remarks about Islam. She also defended the decision not to fire Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser, contending that a thorough faculty investigation had settled the matter.
Gibson, the veteran ABC journalist and a current fellow at Harvard Kennedy School’s Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics, and Public Policy, pressed Faust on how she planned to recalibrate the University’s Allston expansion, but few details were in the offing.
Faust floated several ideas for how the University would proceed on the issue—including potentially co-developing the real-estate—but provided no specifics on the billion dollar construction project’s future.
“[Those properties] are going to be Harvard’s future, but it’s a future that is going to come much more slowly,” Faust said.
Gibson seemed frustrated at times with Faust’s lack of specifics, but in interviews this year, University administrators have been consistently deferring questions regarding the future of the expansion to a series of committees that have been set up to examine potential next steps.
During yesterday’s interview, which alternated between a rather amicable exchange and more terse questioning, Faust also touched on two recent controversies—the scandal surrounding Hauser’s research and a donation in honor of Peretz, a public intellectual who has come under fire for remarks deriding the value of Muslim life.
Faust said that the University would go ahead and accept a $650,000 gift raised in honor of Peretz by a group of his former students.
“These individuals wished to recognize the ways in which he contributed as a teacher to their lives,” Faust said. “So it was their wish to contribute to undergraduate research and to recognize the importance of undergraduate research. That wish seems to us an entirely appropriate basis for a gift.”
Faust also publicly defended the University’s actions regarding the revelation that Hauser had been found solely responsible for several counts of scientific misconduct.
Gibson challenged whether the case demanded more transparency from the University, but Faust contended that a confidential, faculty-led investigation represented standard practice for universities like Harvard.
While recent controversies occupied the lion’s share of the interview, student issues also made an appearance. Hot breakfast, Faust said, is unlikely to make a return this year.
But she also entertained the idea of a student center in Holyoke Center, an idea lauded by Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11.
“That’s something people have clamored for for years—decades actually,” he said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: September 22, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 22 news article "Gibson Grills Drew Faust, Gets Few Details" incorrectly stated that University President Drew G. Faust spoke publicly about Marc D. Hauser during the interview for the first time since news of the scandal broke. In fact, Faust first publicly discussed the issue in an interview published in Harvard Magazine on Sept. 10.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The National Bureau of Economic Research, a Cambridge-based non-profit research organization that announces start and end dates of economic recessions, declared Monday that the recent U.S. recession officially ended in June 2009—well over a year ago.
The report was released by the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, a seven-person committee that includes three Harvard faculty, and established that the trough in national economic productivity occurred in June 2009.
Since then, measures of economic performance such as gross domestic product have indicated that the nation has entered the recovery stage.
This evaluation, however, does not address the fact that the economy still remains far from its pre-recession level of activity.
As political economy professor James H. Stock, a member of the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee, said, “businesses are keenly aware that economic activity remains well below its potential.”
Several key indicators suggest economic weakness and hint against the progression of a robust economic recovery.
Stock noted that the consumer savings rate, currently at 5.9 percent, has remained extremely elevated since the trough of the recession, a problem that continues to plague small business owners by causing a lack of aggregate demand.
Consumers have continued to act as if the prospects of recovery are dim, and their unwillingness to spend hampers the recovery of consumer-driven businesses.
And while GDP has rebounded significantly, unemployment levels—a measure that typically lags behind productivity when a country is emerging from a recession—are still high, said Stock.
Of an estimated 8.5 million jobs lost during the recession, only 1.3 million have been recovered.
“From an employment perspective,” Stock said, “we are not anywhere near where we want to be. There are an enormous number of people without work.”

Even before the preseason began, the Harvard women’s soccer team could  feel the heat of injuries on its back.  First, a broken foot caused  sophomore goalkeeper Courtney Diekema to end her college soccer career  while an IT band injury left the team without classmate Alex Woodcock.   Sophomore Morgan Keefe was next, as chronic shin injuries ended her  season before it could even begin.
And now, a new injury has struck yet once more, as sophomore goalie AJ  Millet suffered an undisclosed injury during practice, putting her out  of play for an indefinite period of time
As a result of Millet’s injury, the starting goalie position has fallen to freshman Jessica Wright.
Luckily for the Crimson, Wright knows her way around the goal.
Making  her debut as the starting goaltender against Boston University last  week, Wright put up impressive numbers. Facing 22 shots from the  Terriers’ forwards, Wright made seven saves on the night. In spite of  the 3-0 loss, team members expressed pride in Wright’s performance.
“Jessie’s been put in this position so suddenly and she’s doing a great  job,” sophomore Alicia Johnson says. “We all have so much confidence in  Jessie and the net behind her. She’s such a leader out there. It’s a  tough position for her to be in but she just has such an amazing  attitude and she’s working so hard.”
Wright had only 24 hours to prepare for her new role as the team’s  starting goalkeeper after receiving word from co-captain Gina Wideroff  and coach Ray Leone the night before. For Wright, the news took some  adjusting to, but support from her teammates helped to excite her for  the upcoming game.
“At first, I was nervous,” Wright says. “But then I got to talk to Gina and she got me really pumped.”
Previously,  Wright had played less than 22 minutes of a collegiate level game in a  3-0 loss to the University of Central Florida a week earlier. Since  Wright spent less than a third of the game on the field when no shots or  goal were taken, her talents remained hidden.
But following her first collegiate start against the Terriers, Wright  took to the net against the University of Rhode Island in the team’s  last preseason match-up. Against the Rams, Wright earned her first  victory as the primary team goalie, letting only one goal past her line  and making five saves.
After two games starting in the net, Wright says the surprise is gone,  but the pressure not only to perform, but to stay healthy as well,  remains. After all, Wright has no reserve goalie to fall back on.
The  third goalie on the team, freshman walk-on Brandy Machado, quit just  before Millet’s injury earlier that week. Yet, Wright has dealt well  with the pressure and high expectations, preparing to take on things one  day at a time.
“I just know that I have to go out there fight hard and hopefully not  get hurt,” Wright says. “And if anything’s minor, I just have to just  suck it up.”
Wright says that the team has been incredibly supportive of her and her new responsibility.
“They’re just a confidence boost,” she says. “Even if something doesn’t  go really well in practice they’re really uplifting, and they’re like  family.” While Wright has the starting position for now, she and her  teammates expressed concern for Millet, wishing her the best of luck in a  speedy recovery. “Obviously we’re really sorry for AJ. But Jessie seems  to be stepping into the role well, and we’re really supportive,”  Wideroff says. “We all believe in her, and she’s really pulling through  for all of us.”
Until Millet returns, Wright will continue to build her confidence each game.
“I  played 20 minutes in Florida, so playing [a full game] was new [to me]  and I didn’t know what to expect,” she says. “But by the second game, I  had a lot more confidence, so it was a lot better.”
With the support of the team and plenty of playing time, Wright feels  more poised in her abilities, and, not surprisingly, her Harvard  teammates are benefiting from the results.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
David Mothander may not be a member of the explosive offense or the stifling defense, but in his first game as the placekicker for the Harvard football team, the true freshman played a vital role in the Crimson’s 34-6 victory over Holy Cross last Saturday night.
“It was a great atmosphere to play in for my first game, being a night game in front of all those fans,” Mothander says. “It was a great way to kick off the season.”
Mothander is no stranger to being in the spotlight when it comes to capping off a drive with some points. As a kicker and quarterback in high school, the former Maxpreps first team All-American led his St. Margaret’s Tartans to a small schools state championship while setting a California high school state record with 99 extra point kicks in a season. Last season, in a post-graduate year at Phillips Exeter Academy, Mothander gained recognition as a 2009 New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) All-New England selection, leading his team to a NEPSAC Championship and an undefeated season.
Yet, success in high school football does not always necessarily transfer to the college gridiron.
But unlike other first-year starters who may have trouble adjusting to the speed of the college game, Mothander has embraced the challenge of taking on collegiate teams.
“The guys we face here in college are definitely faster, bigger, and stronger [than in high school], but I don’t let that phase me,” Mothander says. “All I want to do is execute my job perfectly.”
Despite Harvard’s dominance in the Ivy League over the past decade, inconsistent special teams play—particularly in the kicking department—has hindered the Crimson’s ability to score points by kicking the football through the uprights.
But in Harvard’s season opener, any signs of special teams problems were nonexistent, as Mothander accounted for 10 of the 34 points put up by the Crimson, going 2-for-2 in field goal attempts from 26 yards and 24 yards, and 4-of-4 in extra point opportunities.
And though Mothader has registered just one career start in a Harvard uniform, his strong kicking performance so far has provided the Crimson faithful with an optimistic feeling that Harvard’s struggles in the kicking game could indeed be coming to an end.
Armed with a powerful leg, Mothander was able to do more than simply split the uprights. In handling kickoff duties, he averaged nearly 64 yards per kickoff and even boomed one deep into the endzone for a touchback.
His kicking effort gave the Crimson defense plenty of breathing room, and forced Holy Cross to begin most of its offensive drives deep in its own territory.
“[Mothander] did great on Saturday,” says senior wide receiver Marco Iannuzzi. “Coming out of high school, he came into the high stress of the college game and gave us deep kickoffs, perfect field goals and a solid effort.”
With his strong debut performance, Mothander was named the Ivy League Co-Rookie of the Week, joining fellow Harvard teammates senior quarterback Andrew Hatch and junior linebacker Blaise Deal on the Ivy League honor roll.
“He and the special teams unit were great all night,” Iannuzzi says. “He gained confidence in his ability, knowing that he can perform at the [collegiate] level. The coaches believed in him and that let the rest of the team rally around the special teams and do what we did.”
“I don’t think that this honor should just be an individual award for me; it’s a team award,” Mothander says. “Without the offense and defense executing all night long, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to make my kicks and post the numbers I did.”
With the demonstration that Mothander put on for the crowd and the rest of the Ivy League on Saturday night, Harvard may have found one of the pieces it needs to elevate its special teams play to the next level and add an extra dimension to its already impressive list of weapons.

The Harvard women’s hockey team won’t officially open its season for another month, but that hasn’t stopped its current players and alums from making headlines both on and off the ice.
As a four time Olympic medalist and a former Patty Kazmaier Award winner, Angela Ruggiero ’02-’04 is one of the most successful Crimson alums on the ice, but the defenseman has been making her most recently headlines off it. Named as an athlete representative to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during the Vancouver Games, the former government concentrator will look to expand her influence beyond sports. Ruggiero will be addressing the General Assembly at this week’s United Nations Summit, which started on Monday and will finish up tomorrow.
Meanwhile, three other Harvard skaters, Julie Chu ’06- ’07, Caitlin Cahow ’07-’08 and sophomore Josephine Pucci will be training to take on Sweden, Canada and Finland at the Four Nations Cup this November. Like Ruggiero, Chu and Cahow have become national team regulars and have a combined five medals between them. Pucci, on the other hand, is new to the national team. The defenseman was promoted to the senior squad after her performance for the U-22 National Team at the National Festival.

How about $200,000? According to an article from Forbes magazine, that's how much some nouveau riche parents in China are paying for multiyear programs designed to prepare their children for admission to Harvard.
The article states that these programs consist of weekend classes, summer school, and group trips, beginning three to four years before a student enters college. They also offer consulting services for the application process, providing extra help for interviews and essays. Teachers are usually recent graduates from the best universities in China. Classes defy the Confucian norm—small and personalized, with the opportunity for students to debate with their teachers.
For some Chinese scions, such special academies are only supplements to their extracurricular activities. One student, for instance, told Forbes that he has begun investing in stocks and is already learning to run a business.
Although these programs have started to emerge, they are still not representative of the majority of Chinese students studying in the U.S. Xin Xiang ’13, an international student from China, said “I personally haven’t been through the program because I went to a public high school”. Xiang said she was not even aware of these consulting/preparatory services. “I don’t know how they actually help prepare students for their courses,” she said. “I don’t think it’s worth it and I could do it on my own.” Now that’s the spirit.

"The theater holds 200 and we've been required to set aside a number of seats for the studio and the people doing publicity," he said.

On April 1, a few hundred high school seniors found themselves in a truly terrible situation: having to choose between Harvard and Yale. The majority of cross-admits consistently matriculate to Harvard, so the Yale Daily News talked to some college freshmen to figure out why.
Many of the roughly 65 percent of cross-admits who opt for Harvard every year base their decisions on location and reputation, according to the YDN. For Harvard undergraduate Ben J. Marek ’14, New Haven couldn’t compare to Boston when it comes to culture and proximity to other colleges.
Talhah Zubair ’14 and Dany Jradi ’14 were swayed by the fact that a Harvard degree carries extra weight years after graduation. “If you say the Harvard name, it will open doors for you, not just in the U.S. but internationally as well,” Zubair told the YDN.
Many students chose Yale because of its “more laid-back atmosphere,” according to the article. Cross-admit Stephanie Kan, Yale ’14, said she found that many Harvard students spent their free time studying. But maybe she should talk to Marek, who revealed to the YDN that parties at Harvard “abound.”
Kan admitted to the YDN, “I still wonder if I might be missing out on something in turning down Harvard.”
Our opinion? You just might be.
