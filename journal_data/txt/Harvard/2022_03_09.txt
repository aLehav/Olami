After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women giving birth in metro stations. Kindergartens bombed. Tanks running over civilian cars. Over a million displaced. Eight years after the territorial integrity of Ukraine was first violated by its aggressive neighbor Russia, a new chapter in Eastern European history is being written in real time.
I will not make this a piece decrying the war in Ukraine. Anyone with a moral compass will tell you that what Russia is doing in Ukraine is wrong. But the symbolic meaning that the conflict occupies in every Eastern European’s mind is that of democratic resistance to tyranny, imperialism, and historical revisionism. The process of rewriting history is not bound to a territory, a country, a continent. Instead, it intertwines with the metaphysical. Our self-perception as Eastern Europeans is constantly defined by others — from analysts in D.C., to Russian scholars on Twitter, or the average American — without any grasp on how the West continuously fails to construct an accurate representation of our identities and the lives we lead.
Take Hollywood as an example. Violence, hypersexualization of women, human trafficking, bad guys — the essence of cinematic Eastern Europeanness. For the entirety of my life, that has been the only representation the West has showcased of me, my cultural space, and the social reality of my home.
This representation is completely inaccurate at the best, and incredibly harmful at the worst. At a time when migrant workers from all across Eastern Europe are exploited for their labor in unsafe and appalling conditions in the West, such stereotyping only perpetuates a negative image of Eastern Europeanness. Take “Emily in Paris” as an example (subjectively, one of the worst TV series on the planet). The only cameo of an Eastern European on the show is of a Ukrainian woman who does precisely three things in the series: steals from a department store, curses at Emily in Ukrainian, and constantly worries over her immigration status.
But there is another, stranger layer to the portrayal of Eastern Europeans in the media: the chronically-online aestheticization of what I call home. The bimbofication of Eastern European women, also known as Svetlanacore and “Dark Eastern European aesthetic” (whatever that means), seems to be competing with Y2K themes online as the West gets acquainted with the sociocultural intricacies of this region in the most bizarre way possible. The popular TikTok sound “Sudno” by Molchat Doma is another example of this distasteful aestheticization of Eastern Europe that has resulted in an overwhelming exoticization and obsession with the region.
Discard the poor and superficial humor, and a more complete picture will appear. We are a region traumatized beyond belief. With our intelligentsia systematically exterminated in the 20th century, our private and public lives under the watchful eye of the state for over six decades, and individual freedom virtually nonexistent during the same time, the consequences of centuries of exploitation, totalitarianism, and bloodshed seep through everyday life. That is partially why homophobia, sexism, and racism are all still so prevalent across Eastern Europe. We have yet to fully cope with the totalitarianization of our private lives as we deal with both shared and individual trauma that spans generations.
But there is so much more than the façade of despair, grayness, and destruction that Eastern Europeanness encompasses. We are rapidly changing at a critical speed, and young people are on the very frontlines. Autocratic takeovers in the region have mobilized the youth and revitalized civil society — something that could for once serve as an example to Westerners themselves. We no longer want to consider ourselves victims as we reposition ourselves along the historical axis. We are slowly deconstructing the tropes of the past as we come to terms with the darkest parts of our history.
I, too, am introspecting about my relationship with Eastern Europe. Three out of four classes my freshman fall were in some way or another related to Eastern Europe. It certainly sounds like a targeted choice — even a weird one — for why would a Latvian study Eastern Europe in the United States?
Ironically, I get to explore myself and my identity, and the politics and society of Eastern Europe, more at Harvard than I do at home. Harvard has an undergraduate Slavic department; the largest university in Latvia does not. I get to read contemporary authors from Eastern Europe I had never heard of and consider literary theories in works that would be deemed unacceptable and immoral by a large fraction of Latvian society.
In real time, I am redefining Eastern Europeanness for myself. With or without Ukraine. Because that is the only way to escape the abyss of perpetual exoticization, oppression, and falsehoods that paint a bleak picture of what I call home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a Thursday night, and I’m in the Yard. It’s not too late, but just late enough for the shuttles to the Quad to be few and far between. I’m facing a dilemma that almost every Quadling grapples with daily: Do I wait for the next shuttle, or brave the weather and make the walk?
To me, there’s no wrong decision. The walk gives me time to physically and mentally distance myself from the busyness of campus. The shuttle ride provides a similar opportunity, along with the increased chance of bumping into a friend. For these reasons, I absolutely love the journey to the Quad. This trek and the slight seclusion it creates make my home, Pforzheimer House, one of my favorite places on campus.
No, this isn’t an advertisement for the Quad or Pforzheimer House — it is a message of appreciation for the randomness of our current housing system.
Every spring, each Harvard freshman and up to seven of their friends are randomly sorted into one of the 12 upperclassmen Houses. This process has been carefully adjusted throughout the College’s existence. From the creation of the Houses in the 1930s all the way until 1995, housing assignments were preference-based, causing each House to develop a distinct reputation and attract students of similar backgrounds. The House populations were largely homogenous: the Quad housed Black and Latino students, Eliot had the wealthier, preppy students, and Kirkland served as home for the athletes.
In 1995, randomization was introduced to the housing system, breaking the tradition of self-segregation engendered by preference-based housing. Decades later, we continue to rely on random assignment, but this system has recently been criticized. In a 2021 survey conducted by the Undergraduate Council, some students voiced renewed interest in listing House preferences or characteristics of their desired House.
History cautions against reverting back to a preference-based housing system. Previously, the strong reputation of each House threatened to reduce students to a single aspect of their identity. The sequestration of students based on their identity also fractured the broader Harvard community. Today, the more well-balanced mixture within each House increases exposure to students of different backgrounds and helps to mitigate some of the social barriers faced by students belonging to marginalized groups.
As a first generation, low-income student, I feel very fortunate for the opportunities presented by House life. Knowing that my House affiliation is not determined by my income or non-legacy status is comforting, and spending time with a variety of people has also helped me receive the social education that I sought when I applied to Harvard. If given the chance to surround myself with students from the same background, I am not entirely sure that I would have engaged with such a wide range of people.
This brings me to my favorite aspect of randomized housing: It challenges you to learn to love your House and its community.
In addition to the difficulty of abandoning my comfort zone and connecting with different people, a process which I have grown to appreciate, there are many other parts of Pforzheimer that it has taken time for me to love. I did not always love the Quad journey – what is now a meditative reprieve from my day initially frustrated me. I did not always love the horrendously slow elevator in the Comstock dorms, and I’m still learning to love the unreliable dryer that somehow always draws me back despite requiring multiple cycles to dry my clothes.
I can now say that I believe Pforzheimer House is, without a doubt, the best House you could have the privilege of being assigned. But, at the same time, I am certain that the House you find yourself in is the best for you.
To rising sophomores, even though you might wait with bated breath, desperately hoping for a particular House, you will love wherever you end up. You will accept the overly-friendly vermin, perpetually dirty hallway bathroom, time-consuming walk, or whatever other superficially annoying fixture you encounter. Regardless of the House and community you randomly become a part of, your House will undoubtedly become your home.

DEAR ABEE: I am writing today with a startling and troublesome revelation – I think that “privilege” may exist. Mostly, because everyone keeps telling me I have it.
For context, I am a European Paper Wasp who has recently inherited a top producing nest in an incredibly lucrative foraging district. While this technically makes me a “Queen,” I’m far too down to earth for such a title. “CEO” will do just fine. Because of this intergenerational wealth, I am guaranteed a prosperous life of feasting and socializing while my subordinates are forced to clean, prepare food, and perform dangerous manual labor.
This wealth also means I am the only Paper Wasp in my colony guaranteed reproductive success. Now, if you’re thinking, “Wait a minute. Wealth shouldn’t have any effect on your dating prospects!” Then clearly, you’ve never been to Harvard Business School. But don’t worry, once my children are born, I will leave the menial task of raising them to the peasants who work for me.
Still, despite my high status, the wasps in my colony find ways to chastise me for my position. They claim I “have it easier” than they do. They say my position as Queen has “nothing to do with my skills and abilities.” And most importantly, none of them live long enough to come to my soirees!
So my question is, does being the recipient of a long-line of intergenerational wealth really make you privileged?” – A SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”
DEAR SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”: I regret to inform you that inheriting a real-estate empire does, in fact, make you privileged. But despair not, for there are several actionable steps you can take to run a better colony! For example, don’t call your neighbors “peasants.” It’s very rude and makes you seem stuck up. I also recommend you take immediate action to improve the working conditions of your fellow wasps. If their life span is shorter than your soirees, then you’ve probably committed some intense human rights violations, or, whatever the equivalent is for European Paper Wasps.
I am also mildly concerned that you have transformed your colony into an oppressive oligarchical regime. You own the entire nest, correct? And unless you die, there are no opportunities for any of those wasps to earn their own status or wealth, right? Which means your peers are forever doomed to toil in egregious living conditions while all the power is concentrated in your sticky appendages? Yikes. Very bad public relations. I highly recommend you redistribute your wealth and abolish that noxious social hierarchy. – ABEE
DEAR ABEE: Wow! I had no idea that benefiting from the wealth of previous generations was enough to make you privileged. Thank you for that helpful feedback. But, if you really think about it, don’t privileged people have it the hardest right now? For example, anytime I accomplish something, I only get partial credit for it because all the other wasps think I was helped by “unearned advantages.” And I can’t talk about my real-estate empire, high social status, significantly longer life span, or upcoming spring break plans in Cancún without all the other wasps getting annoyed at me!
Being a recipient of multi-generational power also means that insects are constantly trying to criticize you for arbitrary things like “not paying living wages,” “committing tax evasion,” or “signing open letters questioning the results of sexual assault investigations.”
But most of all, there’s the issue of college applications. If I, a so-called “privileged European Paper Wasp,” decide to apply to Harvard, won’t it be way harder for me to get in? Now, it’s true that my wealth has given me access to private tutors, and admissions counselors, and test prep, and private school, and college visits, and music lessons, and sailing lessons, and Europe. And yes, my Dad is John Harvard. But does any of that really make a difference? – A SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”
DEAR SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”: Judging by the overwhelming amount of rich European Pottery Wasps at Harvard – yes. Your privilege does, in fact, give you a significant advantage in college admissions. And definitionally, this privilege makes your life easier, not harder.
Here’s what I recommend. Stop committing tax evasion. Pay your workers fairly. Support their unions. Stop bragging about your longer life span and reinvest your wealth in projects that will help your fellow wasps. – ABEE
DEAR ABEE: Hmm. “Pay your workers fairly?” Sounds like leftist propaganda to me. And I do support my workers’ right to unionize! You know, just as long as they don’t ask for anything. – A SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”
DEAR SKEPTICAL “POLISTES DOMINULA”: You scare me. — ABEE

A delay in the construction of bicycle lanes in the Porter Square neighborhood of Cambridge stirred disagreement among residents in a Cambridge City Council meeting Monday evening.
During the meeting, the Council approved two communications sent by City Manager Louis A. DePasquale. One proposed an appropriation of more than $700,000 for studies and planning related to the Cycling Safety Ordinance, a law requiring the installation of 25 miles of separated bike lanes in Cambridge. The second informed the Council that the city will fail to meet the CSO’s upcoming construction deadline.
Under the Cycling Safety Ordinance, the city must construct “quick-build” separated bike lanes on the segment of Massachusetts Avenue that runs through Porter Square by May 1, 2022.
In his second letter, DePasquale said the city needs more time to engage “local stakeholders” before moving along with the project.
“We do not expect to be able to complete the level of meaningful engagement we have committed to while still meeting the original deadline,” the letter reads.
Over the course of the nearly 90-minute public comment period, many Cambridge residents voiced their disappointment with the delay.
Alexander K. Epstein, who lives in the Porter Square area, spoke about the death of Bernard “Joe” Lavins, a 60-year-old Lexington resident who was fatally hit by a tractor-trailer in Porter Square while biking.
“I biked with my older son through the intersection about five minutes before Joe Lavins was killed back in 2016,” said Epstein. “That has stuck with me. I think this is a case where safety delayed is safety denied.”
Many residents embraced the delay and argued that the implementation of the CSO has been rushed without sufficient time to understand its economic impacts. They voiced concerns that removing street parking could harm area businesses.
Denise Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said that “the pressures placed on Porter Square are enormous and worthy of pause.”
“We are having this discussion because of the loss of parking for residents and businesses,” Jillson added. “This problem can be solved with strong leadership, thoughtful planning, good design, and a little more time.”
In the meeting, Councilor Burhan Azeem shared his own experience witnessing a collision between a cyclist and a vehicle in Porter Square and warned that excessive delay could allow for further accidents.
“I support this delay because I understand it needs to be done. But also, I imagine how difficult and different this conversation is going to be if we have an accident this summer in Porter Square and, God forbid, someone dies,” he said. “We'll look at this moment very differently.”

Timnit Gebru, the founder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, called for scholars to employ more ethical approaches in artificial intelligence research at an event hosted Tuesday by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
During her talk, part of a Radcliffe lecture series on artificial intelligence, Gebru shared her vision for interdisciplinary AI and her calls for changes in academia. Gebru delivered a virtual talk to attendees, followed by a Q&A with Himabindu “Hima” Lakkaraju, an assistant professor at Harvard.
The conversation began with an introduction to DAIR, which works with researchers from different backgrounds to conduct research around the world. Gebru said traditional research practices can often be “exploitative.”
“We see this a lot, where we have people in one community that have specific types of knowledge, and then people in the academic and research community that go to this community, and without supporting them or collaborating with them, [take] this knowledge,” Gebru said.
“And this group of people whose knowledge was extracted from are not getting any of [the] benefits,” she added.
She spoke about “the publishing rat race” — expectations in academia that researchers must publish lots of work in short periods of time. Gebru said her institute seeks to create a more sustainable working environment for researchers.
“We have a limit, and we want to be healthy and thriving researchers, and we can’t do our best work if we're not healthy and thriving,” she said.
Before founding DAIR, Gebru was a co-lead of the Ethical AI working group at Google. In December 2020, Google fired Gebru over controversy concerning a paper the working group published.
During the Q&A portion of the event, Gebru focused on her vision for the future of DAIR and AI research. She said she hopes to build “a thriving group of researchers who are healthy, who are embedded in their communities.”
She added that she hopes to see the field support organizations with diverse researchers.
Gebru said the “academic incentive structure” requires major changes in order to move toward more ethical AI research.
“We need to change the dynamics such that students, adjuncts, all non-tenure people, etc., have a lot more power to push back,” she said.
To close out the talk, Gebru called on universities to “pass the mic and pass the resources.”
“You have to make sure that the people who are usually at the margins have a seat at the table,” she said.

BazaAr Supermarkets, a small chain of international stores in and around Boston, has stopped stocking products imported from Russia in a show of support for Ukrainian people following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and attacks on civilian areas.
This Sunday, for the second week in a row, more than 3,000 people took to the Boston streets to rally against the war. As a business with immigrant roots, the BazaAr chain is joining in to support Ukraine.
The first BazaAr Supermarket opened in Brookline in 1991. A second market opened in Allston in 2007, followed by one in Cambridge in 2013 and, most recently, one in Newton in 2014.
Sabina Roytman, one of the current owners, joined the company in 2014. Having immigrated from Moldova in the 1990s herself, Roytman said she empathizes with the people in Ukraine.
“We've emigrated from the regime that was there back then, in order to live a better life and to have freedom that we, thank God, have here in this country,” she said.
The BazaAr markets are international stores that carry goods from all over Europe, including Russia. Roytman explained that the company purchases products from overseas indirectly through wholesalers. The stores decided to forgo purchasing Russian imports from its wholesalers.
“We do not want to support the war,” Roytman said. “Our hearts are with the people of Ukraine.”
She said it is still unclear whether the stores will resume stocking Russian goods in the future. The supermarkets’ Ukrainian products may also be unavailable for the duration of the war, she added.
“Unfortunately, we understand that we're not going to have deliveries for a certain amount of time,” Roytman said.
Roytman explained that all four stores have staff members with relatives in Ukraine. The company is working to help these family members and plans to send food to a refugee camp.
“We helped a couple of families to escape to Moldova,” she said.
She noted that the supermarket staff includes immigrants from both Ukraine and Russia.
“We are all immigrants, and we are here in this country because we wanted freedom,” she said. “We wanted better life for us and for our children. And we all pray that the people in Ukraine can have it — can have freedom, can have peace — and that it comes to them as well.”

In honor of International Women’s Day, experts gathered to discuss the state of women’s rights around the world in the face of global injustices at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum on Tuesday.
The panel featured Sima Samar, Carr Center Fellow and former Minister of Women’s Affairs of Afghanistan; Zoe Marks, a lecturer in Public Policy at the Kennedy School; and Nicholas Opiyo, a Ugandan civil rights lawyer.
Sushma Raman —executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy, which co-sponsored the event — moderated the conversation.
Drawing on their international experiences, the panelists emphasized how global conflict and crises affect women and girls.
Marks began the conversation by highlighting the importance of intersectionality in discussions of gender equality.
“What's important for me is really thinking about intersectionality as the place that gender hierarchies and gender inequalities intersect with other forms of inequality in our society, and the way that it demands solidarity and coordination by women from all walks of life,” Marks said.
Samar emphasized the role of education in advancing equality for all individuals, referencing her experiences both in the United Nations and as Minister of Women’s Affairs in Afghanistan.
“One of the problems that we face, and the current situation again, is the issue of education. We ignore education in conversations about equality,” Samar said.
“Access to education is key,” she added.
Opiyo raised the question of to what extent formal representation in political and legal systems makes a difference in the everyday life of the average woman, calling on states to take action beyond performative measures.
“You must have so many women as members of parliament,” he said. “In the election office, we don't pause to think about whether this is having an impact on the ordinary woman.”
“There is a very big difference between the rights provided in the law and the legalization of the law,” Opiyo added. “The problem is not the absence of laws, but rather the commitment of the states to enforce these laws.”
Samar and Marks echoed Opiyo’s emphasis on the importance of representation in all aspects of civil society.
The panelists also examined the need for an effective framework to fight increasingly complex systems of misogynistic oppression. In particular, Marks highlighted the success of the #MeToo movement.
“What was particularly powerful about #MeToo is that it doesn't require women to have the same experiences in order to see commonality,” she said. “It gives us a language and a framework for fighting against the same systems of power and patterns of inequality, despite being affected in very different ways by them.”
In fighting against those systems of oppression, Samar portrayed women’s rights advocacy as a fight for human rights.
“Our existence is a right,” Samar said. “Access to education, access to food, access to a particular list of values is a human right. We have to promote that seamless approach for everyone, everywhere. Otherwise, the problem will continue happening.”

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will replace the Route 71 and 73 trolley buses with diesel-hybrid buses beginning next week, until a fleet of battery-electric buses permanently takes their place in two years.
According to an announcement published by the MBTA in January, the switch to the diesel-hybrid buses on Routes 71 and 73 — the only remaining trolley bus routes in Cambridge — comes as five roadway projects are set to break ground this spring along the routes.
“That’s something that happens from time to time with big projects along these routes and happens all the time for unplanned detours or minor roadwork,” said Scott Hamwey, director of the MBTA’s bus modernization program.
“These are a number of longer duration projects that collectively will require us to run the service with a different vehicle for five and a half years,” he added.
According to Hamwey, the timing of the replacement is ideal considering the age of the current trolley buses.
“These trolley buses are already our oldest buses in the fleet. They’re 18 years old, and they’d be 23, 24 years old when these roadway projects were done,” Hamwey said. “That’s well beyond the normal 15 year lifespan that we try to retire our buses within.”
Hamwey added that decommissioning the trolley buses in order to accommodate the roadway projects fits into the MBTA’s long-term initiative to transition to a fully electric fleet by 2040.
“Instead of five and a half years of diesel service, we’re trying to move as quickly as we can so that we can get battery-electric buses on these routes by March of 2024,” Hamwey said.
Hamwey said that the MBTA aims to finish “finalizing the specifications” for the battery-electric buses by mid-2022. He predicts the battery-electric vehicles for Routes 71 and 73 will be delivered from the manufacturer in the fall of 2023.
According to an MBTA announcement, they will be phased into use by 2024.
“There’s several months of commissioning the vehicle, and the MBTA accepting the vehicle, and training our staff on the vehicle,” Hamwey explained. “We wouldn’t just have the bus arrive and then go right into service.”
According to Hamwey, removing the trolley buses from service and disassembling the overhead electric catenary lines provides greater flexibility for the MBTA’s service.
“When there’s a disruption on the Red Line, or there’s a construction project on the Red Line, we’ll pull buses from around the system,” Hamwey said. “We’re obviously not able to do that with the electric trolley buses because they’re wedded to the corridors that the catenary system are on.”
According to Hamwey, the replacement of the trolley buses will also simplify the considerations Cambridge faces when developing new roadway projects — including bike lanes.
“The infrastructure that supports these buses by itself kind of creates something that has to be worked around,” he said, referring to the trolley bus wire system.

Lent observances are underway on campus, and students are making the most of being back in person.
The Catholic Students Association is hosting events for the religious observance, which takes place across 40 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter. It is observed by various Christian denominations.
Tonna Emenuga ’23, president of the Catholic Students Association, said CSA works with St. Paul’s Parish to provide sacraments throughout the Lenten season. In addition to normal programming this year, the organization is hosting small-group Bible studies, trips to the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, a weekly speaker series, and mass.
Emenuga said students — both Christian and non-Christian alike — have found resolve in being able to observe Lent in-person.
“Counterintuitively, the community has almost benefited from the pandemic,” Emenuga said. “With people coming back to campus this year, just having a renewed fervor for social activity and community and whatnot, I think there’s been a real increased openness to faith.”
Anne Bloomer ’23, the CSA’s treasurer, expressed a similar sentiment.
“It’s just a great time to reflect, to consider how you’re living, consider how you can be better,” Bloomer said.
“That’s something that is attractive to a lot of Harvard students, especially because we are pretty aware and introspective and ask these larger questions about life,” she added.
Bloomer said that she personally views Lent as an opportunity for personal growth.
“It’s ultimately for the betterment of myself, of my relationship with God, and I think also just my relationship with others around me,” she said.
Emenuga converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism just under two years ago. He said the experience shaped his perspective on Lent.
“It’s important for all Roman Catholics, but it’s particularly important in that it’s a great way to not just be cruising the spiritual life, but to really hit the gas and start to run,” he said.
Fadzai Ngwerume ’24, also a convert to Catholicism, joined the CSA freshman year.
Ngwerume, who is from South Africa, said she appreciates observing Lent in person after facing difficulties last year joining online events with a six-hour time difference.
“During a semester-and-a-half, I feel like I’ve grown a lot more, mostly because of the people that I’ve been surrounded with, people who I’ve been able to look up to and inspired me,” she said.
Ngwerume added that the observances help her focus on the three pillars of Lent: prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.
“Lent pushes you to go deep in your faith and makes you die to yourself, to give up yourself more to other people and give up yourself more to God, so that you can go into a deeper relationship with Him,” Ngwerume added.
Correction: March 9, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the class year of Fadzai Ngwerume ’24.

Experts gathered Tuesday to discuss the effects of economic sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine at an event hosted by the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies and the Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies.
The panel featured Sergey V. Aleksashenko, Free Russia Foundation board member and former Russian government official; Adam M. Smith, a partner at law firm Gibson Dunn; and Hans-Helmut Kotz, a professor of economics.
Throughout the discussion, which was moderated by Davis Center director Alexandra M. Vacroux, the experts examined Russian strategies for mitigating economic damage from sanctions and the disparate effects of sanctions on costs across Europe and the US.
Smith opened by observing that the Western response to Russia’s invasion ramped up significantly last week, with some sanctions targeting the Russian central bank and Russian oligarchs and others cutting Russia off from the international banking system.
“One of the things [Putin] did was develop a record-setting level of foreign reserves in his central bank, the idea being that he could then deploy that to buttress some of the pain of supporting the price of the Ruble,” Smith said.
But sanctions from the European Union and the US have foiled Putin’s plans, according to Smith.
“One of the strategies President Putin clearly had going into this war was to try to sanction-proof his economy,” Smith said. “What these sanctions have done is cut him off from those central bank reserves.”
Smith said in an interview that he believed the market assumed that the international response would be “similar” to its “piecemeal” response in 2014 following Russia’s invasion of Crimea.
“The level of unanimity across not just the trans-Atlantic [partnership], the entire G7, and for Canada and Japan was much more muted,” Smith said of the response in 2014.
Kotz then discussed the consequences of the sanctions for Europe, which relies heavily on Russian imports. He said that as a result, the EU has had to exclude Russian energy from its sanctions, unlike the US, which announced it would ban Russian energy imports Tuesday afternoon.
“With relative prices of energy going up, that [ban] will raise the issue of energy insecurity,” Kotz said. “It’s, of course, worse in places where you have a significantly lower GDP per income and lower GDP — I’m now thinking about southern Europe.”
While Kotz focused on the effects of sanctions on Europe, Aleksashenko detailed the Russian response to the sanctions, noting that Russia’s practice of keeping high levels of reserves likely prevented a run on the bank.
“If any country has experienced a run on the banks once, it will keep a lot of cash in its vault, so it was not a problem,” Aleksashenko said. “In the very first days after sanctions, [the Central Bank] gave four trillion rubles of loans to the Russian banking system.”
Aleksashenko also said, however, that the full impact of some sanctions — particularly bans on new contracts with Russia for materials the country may have stockpiled — will not be seen until “sometime later.”
Smith agreed with Aleksashenko, noting that the sanctions could increase in their effectiveness over time.
“There certainly are some sections that are already starting to bite,” Smith said. “The impact of the sanctions — the full scope of that — will become significantly more harsh, maybe devastating on the Russian economy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 set to graduate in May, the fate of Harvard’s student government remains uncertain.
Cheng will leave office this spring having only served half of his yearlong term. The new president of the student government will ascend through one of two routes — a new election triggered by a constitutional referendum or the promotion of current UC Vice President Emmett E. de Kanter ’24.
Cheng vowed during his campaign to “Defund the UC” and restructure the student government via a constitutional rewrite. The Citizens’ Assembly, a group of randomly selected students convened by Cheng to draft the new constitution, will present their final draft by the end of the school year.
In order to pass, the draft must be ratified by a school-wide referendum, overcoming the recently hiked threshold — a two-thirds majority voting in favor, with over two-fifths of the student body turning out to vote.
If this mark is met, a complete reassembly of the Council would take place, including new elections for executive leadership.
Despite receiving pushback from the Council on an early draft, Lowell House Representative and Citizens’ Assembly member LyLena D. Estabine ’24 said that she was confident that voting students would favor the new constitution.
“I think that those who do choose to vote in the referendum will be highly in favor of this new system,” Estabine said. “If people show up, we have a chance at doing something new and exciting.”
Others on the Council were more skeptical.
“I think in its current form, it definitely wouldn't pass through the UC without a lot of revamping and feedback from the UC members,” Council Secretary Jane J. Oh ’24 said.
In the event the new constitution fails, de Kanter would inherit the presidency, and the Council would elect a new vice president.
But de Kanter himself thinks it is unlikely that he will be president.
“I strongly believe that the Harvard student body will ratify the constitution written by the Citizen’s Assembly,” de Kanter wrote in a text message. “The students at this school are ready for a change, and the model that the Assembly is going to pitch is a pretty exciting take on student government that will be more effective, representative, and inclusive.”
When it came to becoming president, de Kanter expressed hesitancy.
“Mike and I have been so focused on facilitating the assembly and numerous other projects relating to student life that I haven’t really given much thought to the possibility of failure,” de Kanter said. “If [the constitution is] not [ratified], then I think I’ll have to think long and hard about what my future with Harvard student government will look like.”
Still, the prospect of a de Kanter presidency was welcomed by some members of the body.
“He seems like a really nice guy, and he’s made some good contributions,” Kirkland Representative Ivor K. Zimmerman ’23 said.
Others praised de Kanter at the expense of Cheng.
“Based off of just temperature, I think he would definitely cool down the tensions within the UC because he is much more willing to communicate and work with us,” Oh said.
“Michael is remarkably obstructionist in preventing the Council from doing their jobs,” Dunster Representative Samuel H. Taylor ’24 said. “I think Emmett is going to be a lot more reasonable to deal with.”
Cheng declined to respond to the criticisms, instead deferring to Estabine.
“He is the last person I would describe as obstructionist,” Estabine said. “He's a builder. He's a creator, and he's a visionary, and he's so energetic about work and not about drama.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 9, 2022 at 7:43 a.m.
A group of graduate students in Harvard’s Department of African and African American Studies called for a set of sweeping reforms in an unsigned letter last month that said the department has become “a hostile environment for AAAS students” in the wake of the sexual harassment controversy surrounding professor John L. Comaroff.
The statement was intended as “a collective response from a majority of AAAS graduate students” to an open letter signed by 38 Harvard faculty — including 14 AAAS professors — questioning sanctions levied against Comaroff in January. The graduate student letter did not list signatories.
The statement, which called on AAAS faculty to demand Comaroff’s resignation, said the professors who signed onto the letter questioning sanctions against him engaged in “an act of grave professional misconduct.”
“The letter has created a hostile environment for AAAS students and signaled to survivors that they are not safe to come forward,” the statement said of the February faculty letter.
The graduate student statement calls for an external investigation into the “complicity” of Comaroff’s wife, Harvard professor Jean Comaroff, in his alleged misbehavior. It also said some AAAS faculty denied knowing about the allegations against Comaroff despite being warned by students of his alleged misbehavior.
The letter, which was obtained by The Crimson, was sent to faculty members over an email listserv by Bulelani M. Jili and Elizabeth S. Ross in their role as the AAAS Department’s graduate student representatives.
Comaroff was placed on unpaid leave in January by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, who is a professor in the AAAS Department, after a pair of investigations found that he violated Harvard’s sexual harassment and professional conduct policies. Two weeks later, 38 professors — including some of Harvard’s most prominent scholars — signed onto the open letter questioning the sanctions.
Comaroff, a professor of AAAS and Anthropology, denies the allegations against him.
Just days after the faculty members' letter was reported in The Crimson, three graduate students filed a federal lawsuit against Harvard that detailed a decade of harassment allegations against Comaroff. Less than two days after it was filed, nearly all the professors who signed onto the open letter questioning the sanctions against Comaroff retracted their support for the statement.
Relying on an account published in the Chronicle of Higher Education, the letter from 38 faculty zeroed in on an interaction Comaroff had with a graduate student, Lilia M. Kilburn, who later signed onto the lawsuit against Harvard as a plaintiff. According to the suit, Comaroff “graphically described” to Kilburn how she would be raped and murdered if she and her same-sex partner traveled to South Africa for research.
The AAAS graduate student letter said Comaroff’s comments in the advising session reinforced anti-Black and Afrophobic tropes that are common in the field.
“Comaroff’s ‘advice’ to a student takes on its full meaning in the context of a department in which derogatory speech about the African continent is not only permissible but routine,” the graduate student statement said.
“Telling a white queer student that she would be raped in ‘Africa’ weaponizes and generalizes the specific predicament of queer, poor, and Black South African women to an entire continent, rehearsing the racist trope of protecting white women from the Black male rapist,” it reads.
Comaroff disputes the lawsuit’s characterization of the advising session. In a statement Tuesday, a lawyer for Comaroff, Ruth O’Meara-Costello ’02, wrote that he was speaking specifically about the danger of a same-sex couple traveling in Cameroon.
“He warned Ms. Kilburn of specific dangers she could potentially face as a queer woman doing research in Cameroon, where she proposed to travel openly with her same-sex partner; not ‘in Africa’ or ‘South Africa,’” O’Meara-Costello wrote. “These dangers are well known, and are echoed by a well-reputed queer women’s legal organization in Cameroon as well as by the US State Department.”
The graduate student letter said 14 AAAS faculty members engaged in professional misconduct by signing onto the letter questioning sanctions against Comaroff.
“Regardless of their intentions, by appending their names and institutional power to such a letter, the signatories intimidated and retaliated against survivors,” the graduate student letter said. “This is more than simply an error in judgment; it is an act of grave professional misconduct.”
Though all the AAAS professors have since retracted their signatures, the graduate student letter said the retractions are “merely a response to public scrutiny rather than a genuine effort to repair the damage” caused by the faculty letter.
Faculty members who signed onto the Feb. 4 letter have since denied having prior knowledge of Comaroff’s misconduct, according to the graduate student statement.
“Even if true, they certainly could and should have known,” the statement said.
The statement said graduate students repeatedly informed department leaders of allegations against Comaroff. After The Crimson reported that he was facing sexual harassment allegations in May 2020, students met with department leaders — including AAAS Chair Tommie Shelby, then-Director of Graduate Studies Alejandro de la Fuente, and professor Emmanuel Akyeampong. In the meeting, the letter said, graduate students informed department leaders “of a substantial ‘whisper network’ about Comaroff’s decades of alleged abuse and our own inappropriate interactions with him.”
After the sanctions against Comaroff were announced in January, graduate student representatives again raised concerns about his behavior, the letter said — including in a Feb. 1 meeting with Shelby, de la Fuente, and current Director of Graduate Studies Marcyliena H. Morgan.
Morgan and de la Fuente both subsequently signed onto the open letter questioning the sanctions against Comaroff, though they have retracted their support for the statement.
Akyeampong, de la Fuente, Morgan, and Shelby did not respond to requests for comment.
The letter called for Harvard’s African Studies Workshop, which was formerly led by John and Jean Comaroff, to be terminated. The program is now headed by Akyeampong.
The graduate student statement calls for improvements in the department’s procedures for handling sexual and professional misconduct, including an internal grievance process as well as a mandatory faculty training on anti-Blackness and gender- and power-based harassment.
The statement demands that the AAAS department support the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’ call for third-party arbitration of sexual harassment cases. It also calls on the department to establish a professional code of conduct for faculty, abolish recommendation letters for all internal competitive processes, involve students in faculty hires, and allow students to take on advisors outside the department.
The letter also calls for the department to fund Black African scholars to come to campus, a cluster hire of Black African and Afro-Latin American women and non-binary faculty, and a restructuring of the department’s mission and curriculum.
“While senior faculty bear most of the blame, the academy incentivizes a culture of abuse over subordinates – and a culture of silence about those abuses – at all levels,” the letter to faculty said. “The next time you are invited to close ranks, think about who you are protecting and who you are hurting.”

“You don’t transfer out of Winthrop,” HoCo co-chair Alli M. Tompkins ‘24 said.
And after just one look around, it’s not hard to see why. Along with the picturesque exterior and the not one, not two, but three courtyards that attract tourists and students alike, Winthrop offers some of the best social scenes on campus. From the Arbella Ball to Throptober Fest — there’s an event at Throp for everyone. Throptober is Winthrop’s very own fall fair, with hay bales, pumpkins, and even a cotton candy-making machine. Not a fan of rolling around in the hay? The Arbella Ball provides a chance to dress up in your finest fits and pay tribute to the boat that brought over Winthrop’s namesake. Not only does Winthrop have extravagant events, but it also hosts weekly steins in the JCR and Lion’s Den to connect with fellow Thropians and grab some great food.
The House’s community also extends to an incredible team of resident tutors, building managers, deans, and proctors. Just this year, one of the Throp tutors hosted a chocolate tasting seminar where she taught a lesson about the history of chocolate and had students smelling (and tasting!) tens of different flavors.
“It's really cool that the tutors here are so committed. They just want to do random things like have us all taste chocolate, so it was really cool,” Tompkins shared.
Clearly, all you do is win win win(throp) with this house!
In Winthrop, more is more. With amenities from the JFK Suite to the Lion’s Den, there’s little that Winthrop doesn’t offer. As one of the most recently renovated houses, Winthrop sophomores often get hallway singles or suites with doubles with no carpeted floors or mice in sight (Winthrop does not settle for anything less)! Sophomores get the chance to live alongside juniors and seniors throughout Winthrop’s three stunning halls: Standish, Gore, and Beren. If you’re looking for a party, check out the Beren Rooftop Room, featuring a gorgeous view of the river.
If you’re looking to study, head down to Winthrop's very own Widener-esque library, grab a snack from the student Grille, or meditate in Winthrop’s Meditation Room. With the Lorraine E. Chickering Music Rooms, Third Wrangler Art and Design Room, and their own gym, Winthrop dwellers have access to a variety of spaces right at their fingertips without ever having to leave.
Tompkins says “Everyone is really happy to be in Winthrop!” and we believe her!
While you’re counting down the days until you can (hopefully!) be sorted into Winthrop — you may still have some lingering questions about life as a Winthropian. Thankfully, Tompkins tells all in this final pitch for this amazing house.
If you could describe your house with a HUDS dish, what would it be? 
AMT: The Sunday night chicken parm.
What major would your house be?
AMT: The first thing that comes to mind is Hist & Lit.
What’s one thing you want a first-year to know about Winthrop?
AMT: We have hardwood floors and no rodents or animals or bugs... So you are winning here.
Why should first-years be excited about Winthrop?
AMT: Winthrop is just the nicest building here. You will not find a physically nicer building. So there’s that, but there’s also a lot of people… Everyone comes here because the dining hall is nice, and there’s so many things. There’s a really beautiful library, the gym, wonderful rooms, wonderful buildings, so many events, and so many people.
If you’re fortunate enough to get this house, we look forward to seeing you rocking your lions sweatshirts all around campus #ThropLove <3.

Eliot House has been described — by its own HoCo co-chairs Ebony M. Smith ’24 and Caroline Bukowski ’24 — as “classy, loving, and homey,” achieving these monikers by fostering a tight-knit community in several ways.
Smith recounts that on her “first day moving in, [she] ran into someone who lived on the fifth floor and he just immediately helped [her] carry [her] things upstairs.” So, if you want to experience a fun meet-cute on your first day of school, Eliot could be the place for you! Meet-cutes aside, since each entryway consists of a wide range of students, there are many opportunities to meet new people from different years.
Eliot’s supportive community shines in their avid intramural participation. The HoCo chairs note that Eliot excels in rowing and volleyball, but even when they do not come out on top, the entire House receives a funny and extensive email play-by-play of the game. Eliot residents are full of house spirit and pride, and many often turn out to watch intramurals as well.
Like its reputation, its events are ornate and festive. Eliot’s most popular event is its spring formal, Fête. Bukowski enjoys Fête as it “gives me the type of vibes I love from the house — old-timey, but just so fun, exciting, and community-based.” During Fête, Eliot boasts a swing band in the courtyard, chocolate strawberries in the dessert room, and a DJ in the dhall (which is a great band name and someone should totally get on that). The house even hosts 1920s-style swing dance lessons in anticipation for the event. Fête’s famed exclusivity is just another opportunity for Eliot residents to make bank: some Eliot residents make a business out of selling plus ones for an unspecified high amount. So, if you want to attend a fun, old-timey event with a friend or attend a fun, old-timey event and make bank, Eliot is the place to be. When asked if other houses have fun spring formals, Bukowski stated, “They do. Ours is just the best.”
Eliot also has smaller events like steins — Thursday night community events with a constant turnout of at least 50 to 100 people. During steins, attendees enjoy pizza, snacks, and drinks and participate in fun activities. They almost always get crashed by students in other houses because Eliot is just simply the place to be. Every month, Eliot also offers enhanced dinners, complete with smoked salmon, pumpkin ravioli, and blueberry sauce. “Basically… they pop off,” says Bukowski.
Eliot tutors are accessible and fun and often hold exciting gatherings to help build the house community, including a piñata smashing session to release stress from those 20-page papers and grab-and-go dining. And, of course, Eliot has no shortage of furry friends. The house has four resident dogs — Izzy, Moose, Oggie, and Vera — that students can play with during Sunday Yappy Hours. The house also has a cat, Ringo, but he is unfortunately often “under the radar.”
Eliot rooms have large common spaces, tons of walk-in closets, and built-in wall lights (“material girl” to a tee). The dorms are beautiful, and the house is always open to accessibility requests.
The only commonly known drawback is that Eliot is on the older side. However, Smith thinks “the argument is kinda weak because we have such beautiful architecture. I love the wood here. I think the fact that we are so old gives us the aesthetic that everybody likes… everything’s not yellow or white like in Winthrop or Lowell.” *shots fired* Although there can be lots of stairs, you’ll have incredible calves by the end of the year.
Eliot’s amenities include the Inferno (a social grille space), a photography room, a record room, a woodshop, and the Golden Arm movie theater. Don’t want to go outside? The tunnels connecting all the entryways make for a short and convenient trek to the dining hall. Beyond saving you from the cold, the tunnels have beautiful artwork: “Everytime I walk down there, I see something new. Yesterday, I realized Albert Einstein was on the wall. I was like, ‘I haven’t seen you this whole time!?’” remarked Smith.
The HoCo chairs were also especially excited about “Espresso Dave.” For 20 years, “Espresso Dave” has come to Eliot before finals to provide students with a free Starbucks-eque menu. While the actual barista (and therefore the barista’s name) has changed, Eliot residents still call them “Espresso Dave” and that’s that.
What Hogwarts house would Eliot be sorted into?
ES: Well, I think it’s between Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Gryffindor. I feel like it’s the creative part. Everybody’s either playing a piano and we have this amazing record room. Isn’t that Hufflepuff, like creativity?
CB: Singers, dancers. People play piano in the library, and you feel like you’re transformed into the 1800s.
ES: Well wait, let me look up Hufflepuff… Justice, loyalty, patience, and a propensity for hard work.
CB: I think that’s us. We put in the work, but we also love everyone.
What side of TikTok would your house be on?
ES: I feel like we would be the “material girl.” I think it fits so well.
CB: Our last enhanced dinner, we had plates that had Eliot insignias on them. We had Eliot House napkins and glasses. We were waited on and everything.
ES: We had a holiday dinner. We had wreaths and cute tablecloths. It was very pretty. I love this dining hall. I think I actually made a TikTok at the enhanced dinner to the “material girl” sound. Like I was sitting there all “material girl” with my apple cider.
What can freshmen look forward to after they are sorted into Eliot House? 
CB: We have a ton of stuff planned for incoming freshmen. Once they get in, they’re part of the Eliot community. Immediately, they are added to our email list, they know what’s going on, they’re always invited, they’re invited to Fête. Once you get in, you’re part of a whole new community, and you get to be embraced by love.
ES: If you’re a freshman and you get this house on Housing Day, just know that everybody wants you here, and you’re going to have a place here… People are just so nice and welcoming.

Kirkland, commonly dubbed “K-House,” has no shortage of traditions and festivities. If gift-giving is your love language, you’re in the right place! Along with the winter holiday dinner, a festivity in itself, one of the biggest events of the House is Secret Santa Week, during which Kirklanders sign up to participate in a House-wide gift exchange. If weekly events are more of your speed, you can enjoy Boat Club, originally started by members of the crew team and now run by resident tutor Kori Z. Bersin, which offers freshly-baked cookies every Monday night.
One of the newer K-House traditions is the Choosening: every Sunday at midnight, chanting can be heard as the theme of the week is chosen out of an animal cracker jar. Once a theme is chosen, the theme forms the basis of the Kirkland community, and can be spotted throughout the House in the form of puns or references. Some of the themes for previous weeks have included blue week, record week, and Up week.
“I've never really felt any strong ties to Harvard until this year when I came and lived in Kirkland,” HoCo co-chair Michelle Stegawski ’23 said. Overall, Kirkland’s biggest perk is its ‘kommunity.’ Because of how small the House is, you will cross paths with many other Kirklanders, but fret not! Waving at each other, asking about each other's days, and getting to know housemates becomes the daily norm and only serves to strengthen the Kirkland community.
“I think some of the best people at Harvard live in Kirkland, you can sit down with anybody in the dining hall, and you'll learn something really cool, really interesting,” HoCo co-chair Aurora M. Avallone ’24 added.
As a sophomore in Kirkland, you will have a pretty good chance of being placed in DeWolfe housing, with AC and heating included— need I say more? If not in DeWolfe, sophomores are usually housed in doubles or triples, typically within a suite consisting of two rooms and a common room. This housing arrangement only adds to the close-knit spirit of Kirkland. Juniors can typically expect to share rooms, but you can look forward to your own single by senior year. And if you’re adventurous or befriend too many Kindlanders, you can opt to live in one of the two available 10-man suites known for regularly hosting parties.
As a Kirklander, you will also have exclusive access to the historical Hicks House, which serves as the House library. Hicks House is the second oldest house in all of Cambridge, with a collection of books equally as historic.
You won’t even need a scooter, as Kirkland’s architecture makes getting around easy. “Our basement is just one big snake, so people will go all the way from one end just to go do laundry or to fill up their water bottle and, without a doubt, [will] cross paths with people,” Stegawski said. “And so I would really say the architecture in the building design lends to our unique community.”
Any lingering doubts about Kirkland? We caught up with its HoCo chairs for more info.
If Kirkland was a caffeinated beverage, what beverage would it be?
MS: An energy drink, just because once you get that Kirkland spirit, you’re just ready to go, and you won’t stop.
AMA: We have a lot of energy and lovingness. An energy drink can make people ready to go and hang out with people.
What HUDS dessert would Kirkland be?
MS: The carnival cookies, they are just so colorful and every day is a carnival at Kirkland.
AMA: Honestly, we have a petting zoo. We have all of it.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
AMA: Embrace the community. I think that's big, for whatever House you get, but especially for Kirkland. A lot of folks come here, and maybe they're not as extroverted, maybe they're not as wanting to get involved in a community. But Kirkland just sort of has that way of drawing you in, in a way that is so enchanting and inviting, that makes you want to join HoCo, that makes you want to hold the door for somebody, to strike up a conversation in the dining hall. I think that that's unparalleled to some of the bigger Houses. Like I can walk through the dining hall right now and probably know almost everybody's name, and I've only been here for not even two semesters.
MS: You'll feel at home here, and you'll find your place.
