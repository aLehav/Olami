After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the old mantra goes, offense wins games, but defense wins championships.
Forget the 17 goals that Harvard and Boston College had scored in their first two meetings this season—it had been over a month since the two squads last faced off, and a lot of hockey happened in that time. These were two different teams that showed up at Ridder Arena in Minneapolis on Friday night, and defense ruled the day in a bruiser that saw the Crimson rack up four penalties—including an ejection of Harvard junior forward Miye D’Oench just 15 minutes into the contest for a five-minute major and a game misconduct.
Both teams—especially the Eagles—got their fair share of scoring looks and open lanes. But in a game that saw two of the top-three point leaders in all of Division I women’s hockey—Boston College junior forwards Alex Carpenter (81) and Haley Skarupa (71)—it was the gloves, the pads, the stick, and the body of Harvard junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer that stole the show in the Crimson’s thrilling 2-1 triumph.
REDEMPTION, PART TWO
Only a little more than a period and a half into the Nov. 28 game against Boston College, Harvard junior goalie Emerance Maschmeyer found herself skating towards the Crimson bench and off the ice. It wasn’t the end of a period or the result of an injury—Harvard coach Katey Stone thought it was time for a change.
After a goal by the Skarupa midway through the second frame, the Boston College lead had swelled to 5-2, and Stone motioned for the next Crimson goalie on the bench, sophomore Brianna Laing, to relieve Maschmeyer.
The Bruderheim, Alberta, native could only watch as the Eagles continued to find hole after hole in the Harvard defense. By the 8:23 mark of the final period, the score was now a 10-2 disaster. Having seen enough, Stone put Maschmeyer back into the game for the last 11-plus minutes of the contest.
The game might have been far out of reach, but something clicked. Maschmeyer saved the seven shots that came her direction in her third-frame return—not a triumphant one to say the least, but certainly something to work with.
“That 10-2 loss was not a great feeling, so of course there [was] a lot of extra motivation on that end,” Maschmeyer said after the NCAA semifinal game.
Flash forward to Feb. 10, when the Crimson and Boston College faced off for a second time in the Beanpot final. In what proved to be her 10th win of the year, Maschmeyer stopped 30 of the 32 shots that came her way, weathering seven Eagles power plays to ensure that the skaters from Harvard would be the ice hockey queens of Boston, at least for the year.
“It doesn’t matter who I’m going up against,” said Maschmeyer after the win, which clinched the Crimson’s first Beanpot title since 2010. “For me, I look across the ice and say I’m going to win this battle, and I just have to outplay the other goalie to win.”
And in the third matchup between Maschmeyer and Boston College freshman goalie Katie Burt on college hockey’s biggest stage, outplay the other goalie she did. Harvard’s net-minder was everywhere on Friday night, sprawling this way and that, doing everything in her power to keep the puck out of the net.
Even after the Eagles broke through the brick wall with a top-shelf shot off a rebound off the boards with 4:23 to go in the game, Maschmeyer didn’t let Boston College cash in on its newfound offensive momentum.
A minute-plus remaining, empty net for the Eagles. Shot from Boston College forward Kenzie Kent—save Maschmeyer. Carpenter shot—save Maschmeyer. Carpenter again—save Maschmeyer.
As the Crimson netminder cradled the puck for her 43rd and final save, a half-dozen red and white-jerseyed bodies crashed to the ground around her, some trying to wrench the puck from her gloved hand, others trying to prevent that from happening.
The whistle blew loud and clear, and as the officiating crew pulled apart bodies from the pileup, at least one thing was certain.
Maschmeyer still had that puck.
RIVALRY ON ICE: BOSTON EDITION
Though Harvard had proved itself capable of the big win when it took down Boston College in the Beanpot final, which handed the Eagles their first loss of the season, it would seem that the hockey gods wanted to see a rubber match between the two programs.
“Just another great battle with a crosstown rival, but this time in Minnesota,” Stone said.
The game started with defense, with neither team scoring in the first two periods of play. Then the Crimson finally found a breakthrough, as senior Kalley Armstrong scored through the five-hole of Burt on a shot that Armstrong herself dubbed “some junk on the net.” Six minutes later, Harvard junior forward Mary Parker followed it up with a shorthanded goal as Burt fell over backwards, putting the Crimson up two.
The Eagles’ lone goal came off a perfect bounce off the boards behind the net that fell at the feet of senior Emily Field, who one-timed a shot top-shelf to cut the lead to one.
But the Harvard defense, which Maschmeyer willed on until the final whistle, held firm to seal the deal.
When asked if she could see her team making the NCAA championship game after the 10-2 loss to Boston College in November, Stone revealed she was almost glad that the Eagles gave her team such a thorough beatdown.
“[T]hose things happen, and sometimes they’re the best things that could happen to a hockey team,” Stone said. “We really had to take stock after that…. That weekend was a huge turning point for us.”
Bit by bit, piece by piece, the Harvard team that skated onto center ice on Friday night came together after an 0-2-2 stretch in November that culminated in the Boston College loss. There was the three-pronged attack of forwards Parker, D’Oench, and Samantha Reber, who each scored at least 17 goals. Then there was the stifling defense of junior Michelle Picard and senior Marissa Gedman, the two defenders that recorded plus-minus ratings of plus-21 and plus-25, respectively. And Maschmeyer, who has allowed just six goals in the past six games, held her ground in the crease.
Harvard and Minnesota may have a Sunday date for an NCAA championship, but the Crimson proved that the local crown belongs in Cambridge as a result of the instant classic that went down late Friday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just one game of ECAC hockey left to be played, the Harvard men’s ice hockey team has the NCAA tournament in its sights. Having beaten top-seeded Quinnipiac, 5-2, on Friday to advance to the conference championship game, the Crimson has an 81 percent chance of advancing past this weekend according to College Hockey News. Here, The Back Page takes a look at some of the possible scenarios where Harvard can advance.
All listed rankings reflect the latest Pairwise rankings, a highly predictive method of determining which 16 teams will advance to the NCAA tournament. The 16-team field officially will be announced on Sunday at noon. All times are listed in EST.
If the Crimson can pull out a win on Saturday, it can put its calculators away. With a victory over No. 13 Colgate in the ECAC title game tonight, Harvard will secure an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. The Crimson currently ranks 11th in the Pairwise but could move up to as high as 8th, which would likely give Harvard a two-seed in the tournament next weekend.
If the Crimson loses, Colgate will instead punch its ticket to the tournament. However, Harvard’s season still has a good chance of continuing. But the Crimson’s fate will lie in the hands of several teams around college hockey.
Back in Boston, No. 3 Boston University takes on UMass Lowell in the Hockey East championship game Saturday night. The River Hawks are tied for 16th in the rankings and are currently on the outside of the field looking in. The Terriers will be playing in the NCAA tournament regardless of the result, but a win for UMass Lowell will knock one bubble team out of the field. Should Harvard lose and BU win, the Crimson will have a spot in the field. But should Harvard and BU both lose, the Crimson has to turn its attention elsewhere.
The other action Saturday that has an impact on Harvard’s chances will be taking place in the Big Ten and the National Collegiate Hockey Conference. No. 10 Minnesota takes on No. 19 Michigan for the Big Ten Title at 8:00 p.m., and No. 6 Miami (Ohio) faces No. 9 St. Cloud State for the NCHC title at 8:30 p.m. Meanwhile, No. 2 North Dakota plays No. 7 Denver in the NCHC consolation game.
If Harvard and BU each lose, the Crimson will need wins from Minnesota, St. Cloud State, and Denver in order to advance. Harvard would receive a four-seed in the tournament in this scenario.
Elsewhere across the ECAC, despite losing to the Crimson in the conference semifinals on Friday, Quinnipiac has all but secured its spot in the field. The Bobcats are currently tied for 14th in the PairWise but can not fall any lower than 15th, meaning their 5-2 loss to Harvard will not be the final result of the season for the ECAC regular season title winners.
Meanwhile, No. 18 Yale has a 28 percent chance of advancing as well, but the Bulldogs will need their fair share of help. Yale has a chance to advance if both the Crimson and the Terriers can pick up wins in their respective championship games. The Bulldogs fell to Harvard in a three-game quarterfinal series at Ingalls Rink last weekend.
Scenarios for Harvard To Advance:
1) Win vs. Colgate
2) Loss vs. Colgate, BU Win vs. UMass-Lowell
3) Loss vs. Colgate, UMass-Lowell Win vs. BU, Minnesota Win vs. Michigan, St. Cloud State Win vs. Miami, Denver Win vs. North Dakota

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 22, 2015, at 5:02 a.m.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y.—Harvard’s Colin Blackwell scaled the boards, lifting his chin above the short glass of Herb Brooks Arena. The fourth-year forward’s head was finally in the right place.
After nearly two seasons lost to concussion-related symptoms, Blackwell could celebrate an empty-net insurance marker in the ECAC tournament final. Fifty-five ticks of the 1980 Olympic scoreboard later, the real celebration began.
With a 4-2 win over fourth-seeded Colgate (22-12-4, 11-7-4 ECAC) on Saturday, the sixth-seeded Crimson (21-12-3, 11-8-3 ECAC) clinched its first conference championship and automatic NCAA tournament bid since 2006. Junior forward Jimmy Vesey scored twice and set a tournament scoring record to capture All-Tournament Most Outstanding Player honors.
For Harvard’s class of 2015, Friday’s win marked the realization of a dream years in the making. Injuries and eligibility issues kept much of the highly-touted class’s talent off the ice as the Crimson struggled through the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 seasons.
On Saturday, the fourth-years delivered. Goaltender Steve Michalek recorded a game-high 30 saves, and defenseman Patrick McNally scored the game-winning goal and added two assists. Blackwell topped things off with his empty-netter from the neutral zone.
“I’m particularly proud of the way they’ve handled themselves through a number of different circumstances, whatever came their way,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato '91, who captured his second conference title in 11 years behind the bench. “Just looking at the score sheet tonight gives me chills.”
Vesey, meanwhile, provided a dominant performance in the most important game of his college career. His second goal of the night and ninth of the postseason broke the ECAC all-time goal-scoring record for a single tournament, set by Cornell’s Doug Marrett in 1973. He also drew two key penalties, including a tripping minor with under five minutes to play.
Vesey scored the game’s first goal at 12:22 in the first period, punching in a rebound from junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo at the right side of the crease, but Colgate junior forward Darcy Murphy evened the score less than three minutes later.
Seconds after officials reviewed and waved off an unsuccessful attempt by sophomore forward Derek Freeman, Murphy trapped a rebound off a faceoff win in the Harvard zone and batted the puck past Michalek.
Vesey’s record-setting goal put the Crimson back on top 1:29 into the second period. Working with the puck from the right side of the cage on a power play, the junior forward eluded a poke check by Colgate goaltender Charlie Finn before sliding one past his far pad.
“[Vesey] is one of the best players we’ve seen in our league in a long time,” Raider coach Don Vaughan said. “He has unbelievable control over his game. He seems effortless in his stride; I’ve never seen him break a sweat.”
After Vesey drew a slashing penalty that prevented a potential breakaway for Colgate’s Daniel Gentzler, McNally extended the Crimson’s lead to 3-1, beating Finn five-hole with a wrister from the right faceoff circle at 8:16 in the second period. McNally, who returned to the lineup last weekend after undergoing rehab for a potentially season-ending knee injury, earned All-Tournament team honors alongside Vesey and Michalek.
“I think [a chance at an ECAC title] was one of the reasons why I decided to push myself and try to come back,” McNally said. “I knew that with the group of guys that we had, that we could make a run like this, and I just wanted to be a part of it and try to help out as much as I could.”
Its season on the line, Colgate nearly tied the game late. Senior forward John Lidgett received credit for the Raiders’ second goal after a crease-scrum in which Crimson junior defenseman Desmond Bergin inadvertently kicked the puck past Michalek. With just over a minute to go, Colgate captain defenseman Spiro Goulakos grazed a potentially game-tying shot off the right post.
The miss marked a difficult end for the Raiders, who entered the year as the preseason conference favorites and were looking for their program's first ECAC crown since 1990. Colgate finishes its tournament just outside the top 16 teams of the PairWise rankings, a highly predictive measure of selection to the NCAA tournament.
Meanwhile, Harvard’s win will allow Yale to secure an at-large bid. The Crimson will learn the identity of its first round opponent on Sunday afternoon.
“It’ll be a fun one if we get those guys again at some point,” Criscuolo said of the Bulldogs.
Picked to finish in the bottom half of the ECAC in preseason polls, Harvard put up the best record in college hockey through December yet suffered key injuries and a second-half slide in the new year.
But with the late returns of McNally and Blackwell, the Crimson survived a late third period deficit in Game 3 of the ECAC quarterfinals at Yale before sweeping through its final two opponents in Lake Placid. Harvard is the lowest-seeded team to win the ECAC tournament title since another sixth-seeded Crimson team won in 2004.
“This is a talented group that believed in themselves,” Donato said. “They refused at every turn to listen to what some people on the outside thought.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s hockey team is racing towards a championship matchup against Minnesota, but less than four months ago, this final destination appeared improbable, if not downright delusional.
On Nov. 28, 2014, Harvard sleepwalked through a 10-2 nightmare at Boston College, and the eight-goal defeat dropped the Crimson to 0-2-2 over its past four games. Although Harvard scraped by lowly Northeastern in its next match, the early-season skid left the Crimson with plenty questions, including the big one: where to go from here?
“[We] stuck to playing for each other,” senior forward Hillary Crowe said. “That has gotten us to where we are now.”
The Gophers never underwent such a tremendous setback against a local foe. Instead, the team’s largest defeat of the season came in early February, when Minnesota lost at North Dakota, 3-0. The next day, the Gophers returned with vengeance and earned a 3-1 victory against the same squad.
“This team, we haven’t had a lot of adversity,” Minnesota coach Brad Frost admitted.
Harvard and the Gophers may have followed different roadmaps, but on Sunday afternoon, the two teams from different regions of the nation will collide in Minneapolis with a national title on the line.
For top-seeded Minnesota, championship matchups have become an annual ritual. The team has appeared in the past three national title contests, claiming two of these matches.
“They’re very skilled,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said of her team’s next opponent. “They’ve got weapons all over the ice, [so] I think they’re a balanced team.”
By contrast, the Crimson has not played in a Frozen Four final since the 2004-05 campaign. That year, Harvard met Minnesota in the championship and stomached a 4-3 loss.
While much has changed since then, the overall dominance of the two teams has not. Just as in 2005, the Crimson enters the final game of the season as the ECAC champion, while the Gophers enter the contest with a 33-3-4 overall record.
During her three-year stint with the program, Minnesota forward Hannah Brandt has never known a season without a championship bout. The junior star, producer of a goal and two assists in a semifinal win over Wisconsin, ranks second in the nation with 73 points.
The Gophers’ attack extends beyond Brandt, however, as eight total Minnesota players own double-digit goal totals. Next to Brandt, sophomore forward Dani Cameranesi paces the team with 64 points.
The Minnesota offense will square off against some of the strongest blue liners in the nation in Harvard’s veteran defensemen. The Crimson defense includes two former Olympians (junior Michelle Picard and senior Josephine Pucci) and one co-captain who has played in every game this season (senior Marissa Gedman).
“They’re big and strong and very talented,” Frost said. “We’re going to have to try to get pucks and bodies to the net…. It’s going to be a very difficult task.”
Even if the Gophers escape for a breakaway opportunity, the hometown squad will have to get by junior goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who made a season-high 43 saves in a Frozen Four semifinal versus the Eagles. On the season, Maschmeyer has stopped shots at a rate of .945, good enough for tied for third in the nation.
Minnesota junior netminder Amanda Leveille is one of the two players with a higher save percentage, checking in at .946. Against the Badgers, the junior proved capable of the big stage once again, and on the year, she allows 1.18 scores per contest.
Like the Gophers, Harvard will rely on a range of players to crash through this defensive wall. Junior forward Miye D’Oench, sophomore forward Sydney Daniels, and junior forward Mary Parker have scored 19, 19, and 17 goals, respectively, on the season for the Crimson.
While these statistics matter, perhaps the most significant number of the matchup is this one: 3,400. That’s how many people can cram into Ridder Arena, regular-season home of Minnesota and postseason site of the Frozen Four. On Sunday night, the rink will surely have the feel of a home game for the Gophers.
There is, of course, the added knowledge that hometown crowds go quiet when hometown teams lose. On Sunday afternoon, Harvard will try to silence a stadium of Minnesotans by grabbing a national championship that once seemed a stretch of the imagination.
“We’ve played in some pretty hostile environments throughout the season,” Stone said. “We get acclimated very quickly to the building we’re in…. We’ll embrace it and try to make some noise of our own.”

Instead of doing the ever popular plans of going to a foreign country or going on a wonderful service trip, I decided to just head home to Brooklyn for Spring Break. See some friends, get some rest, forget about the work that was waiting for me back in Cambridge. But I also wanted to make my break meaningful and have an experience I could look back on and be proud of participating in. Yep, that’s why I decided to take a beginner’s trapeze class.
It’s weird that I decided to do this because I have a fear of heights. Prior to my trapeze class, I was not fond of the idea of plummeting down from high places. That’s why I hated escalators, roller coasters, or anywhere really that I could see how far up I was from the ground. That’s probably why I wanted to do something like a flying trapeze to break that old fear of mine.
The closest (and cheapest) trapeze class I could find was from STREB Lab for Action Mechanics. I took an hour-long trip to Williamsburg to reach to the studio for the 6:30 p.m. class. After signing in at the front and changing, I went to embark on my destiny.
There were three instructors waiting for the class to begin. Luckily, almost everyone in our group was trying this out for the first time as well. We were introduced to each other (no, not Harvard introductions) and told the basic tenets of how it would go down for the next two hours. If all went well, we would able to practice getting caught by someone at the end of the session.
First, we were strapped with harness belts like ones for rock climbing, so we could be hooked up to ropes for our safety. We did a practice run on a stationary bar that was closer to the ground. The basic procedure was that first we grab the bar, lock in your knees in order to hang it over the bar, and then free your hands so you’re basically hanging by your legs in the air. We all had a good time practicing this part.
Then it was time to go on the actual thing. Right before it was my time to go, I asked for advice from a girl who had done this class before. She thought for a moment and then just told me to “hold on.” My confidence level wasn’t exactly at the highest at that moment. Looking back, the worst part was probably climbing the ladder to the platform. It was skinny, long, and it shook just enough to make you feel like you would fall (even while hooked in). The time before the jump makes you think about the important things: the psets you forgot to do, the plans you need to make for the summer, and family and friends too. But there comes a time where you just have make that little bunny hop...and I did.
Even with the expectations given to us by our instructors, nothing beats the actual thing. I felt this great rush of wind as I was hanging on to this heavy bar for my dear life. But at the same time, I had to remember the directions given to us. Trying to hang my legs over a bar in mid-swing wasn’t so easy. But somehow, I was able to complete the commands my instructor had given to me, especially dropping from the bar to land on the ground which was covered (thankfully) by a huge balloon cushion.
I went on the swing again for four more times. One time, I fell flat on my face after failing to get my legs in the proper position. Though I never got to the catching part, I did have fun until the class was over. It was so weird, I’m still confused as to why I wanted to do this so badly. Maybe I wanted something exciting to put on my resume (proficient in Spanish, can use Microsoft Word, can literally flip in the air for you). I do know one thing for sure– that I had never been this sore before. I worked out muscles I never thought I had. But the time I had in the air was exhilarating. It's been one of the best Spring Break experiences I've ever had. I just wish I had a GoPro to show it happening as I saw it.
Summary:Successful trips in the air: 4Weight lost by fear: 10 lbsAmount of dollars paid for Icy-Hot pads: 20Experience: Priceless
