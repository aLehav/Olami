Emerging alternative musician Indira Ellis writes songs that she hopes people will relate to. She believes the term “genre” is malleable and mixes all of her own music, sometimes even in her closet.
“I was so in my head about, like, what genre am I making? … alternative is really anything that's not mainstream, but we all have our own perspective on what counts as alternative and what doesn’t,” the singer said.
Originally from South Florida, Ellis grew up listening to a lot of music from the early to late 2000s, including artists like My Chemical Romance, Evanescence, and AFI. Her taste, she recalls, was influenced by the music that her older brother listened to. Her current interests include artists like Ashnikko and Taylor Swift.
“I feel like I would say I'm trying to develop my own sound like my own place in this collection of sounds we consider a genre,” Ellis said.
Ellis was involved in musical theater growing up. Moving from South Florida to study theater in New York, she found the art form to be slightly gatekept, especially having not been exposed to Broadway for most of her life. Ellis described the decision to choose either film or theater to study in college as “messy,” but decided on film due to its relative youth as an art form.
“This was an art form that … is still being shaped… the history is so tangible, and it's something that you can just kind of start getting into,” she said. “I think there was something about that that really drew me to it.”
Ellis graduated from Columbia University, majoring in Film and Media Studies. Both of these worlds play a role in her work. She cites her screenwriting classes as places where she received helpful feedback, learned more about the process of making art, and how to think about art itself.
“I think one thing that my Film and Media Studies gave me that was really powerful with all the art that I try to make is the ability to have a better understanding of how what I'm creating might be perceived … also to have just like a stronger sense of my own vision and understanding that how things are taken in and how things are understood, is up to interpretation,” Ellis said.
In college, Ellis worked in the News and Arts departments at WKCR, Columbia University’s radio station. Most of the time, she found herself in the position of the interviewer, listening to other people. Working on her hour-long time slot, Ellis perfected the audio over and over. This perfectionist process both helped her as an artist, making her standards for production quality high.
However, Ellis recognizes this perfectionism as something she eventually has to let go of in order for her own particular sound to be heard, an experience that can be freeing. She describes the debate of when to move a song out of the closet as a back and forth:
“I'm still like, it's not ready,” she said. “I'm always striving to clean it up and make it sound perfect. And that sort of thing I got from working with sound on the radio station WKCR, but I think there's also the point where I had to kind of like, put it down for a little bit, let it go.”
Although Ellis found her place in college, the pandemic uprooted that sense of security when she was sent home as a sophomore. Away from normalcy and college friends, she found that a creative, musical outlet was the perfect place to process these changes. Her new single “Hemlock Lane” speaks to that transitional time during the early days of the pandemic.
“In those first few months, I also moved, so it went from, you know, not being around all my friends and that sort of thing to not even being in a place I was familiar with,” Ellis said. “And so it was that sense of being home, but not being a part of it and not really being familiar with places anymore. But I really wanted to encapsulate that in a song.”
Although her new single “Hemlock Lane” speaks to a feeling of unfamiliarity, she hopes her experiences are not singular, that others may recognize themselves in her music. She describes these creative endeavors as “a sort of home,” and hopes they speak to a greater shared experience.
“I don't think we really have completely unique experiences,” Ellis said. “I think like, if I'm feeling something, obviously, other people are also feeling that. And if I can, you know, make something that reaches people and connects with them, I think that'd be super cool.”
Indira’s new single “Boys With Guitars” comes out on Nov. 9.

Released on Nov. 4, Drake and 21 Savage’s new album “Her Loss” is “the most relatable album ever,” according to Michael B. Jordan. Serving as the epitome of that post-breakup acceptance phase, the album sees a long-overdue comeback from the Toronto and Atlanta rappers. The two first paired up in 2016 on “Sneakin,” when 21 Savage was still up-and-coming and Drake was basking in the limelight of yet another successful album, “Views.” Much has changed since then — 21 is now a well-established frontman of the Atlanta rap scene while Drake remains as relevant as ever thanks to his many subsequent, albeit less successful albums. However, if one thing remains the same, it is undoubtedly that Drake and 21 remain a force to be reckoned with.
The album’s first track, “Rich Flex,” offers a fitting introduction to the album. It reflects the duo’s longtime collaboration and mutual love. Drake’s iconic viral line, “21, can you do somethin' for me?” works to hype up 21 Savage and reflects Drake’s guidance and support in his career. Track three, “On BS,” features some clever wordplay in the second verse, with Drake’s acapella leading into the monorhyme scheme.
Throwback tracks like “Privileged Rappers” and “Broke Boys” are a nod back to their early days, when “Sneakin” saw Drake and 21 first join forces to hash out beef with “reachin and dissin” rappers. The nostalgia thickens with the re-sampled vocals from Drake’s 2013 song “Come Thru” on “Hours In Silence,” the somber refrain making it sound like it came straight from “Nothing Was the Same.” The lyrical continuity aids the familiar sound, with 21’s sappy lovesick line “Tryna be the one for you, but my nickname true.”
“Her Loss” is a masterclass in seamless transitions. On “Rich Flex,” the melody constantly switches between the 90’s nostalgia heard in the intro, to the R&B in Drake’s crooning segue, and the borderline drill-like hi-hats in the chorus and the track’s second half. The flow is equally as transient; from Young Nudy’s conversational lines in the intro and outro, to 21 Savage’s raunchy lyrics: “I'm a savage / Smack her booty in Magic” — a nod to Megan Thee Stallion’s beat on “Savage.”
The very next track, “Major Distribution,” follows that thread, doing a 180 on the beat with the slapstick line “You say I'm persuasive, girl, but you can't spell that shit, for real.” The subs don’t stop there, with the controversial lyrics on “Circo Loco” that take a swipe at artists like Kanye and Megan Thee Stallion over a Daft Punk sample.
The samples play a big part in bridging these gaps, like in “Spin Bout U.” With choraling vocals pulled from B.G.O.T.I.’s “Give Me Your Lov-N,” Drake breaks the fourth wall between the samples and production with the line, “But just like that R&B group from the '90s.” This self-awareness is a good look for post-“Certified Lover Boy” Drake, who learned to lean into the cheesiness of his rapping.
This lighthearted approach doesn’t prevent him from getting into the more thoughtful topics — on the contrary, it makes them stand out on the track even more: “Damn, just turned on the news and seen that men who never got pussy in school / Are makin' laws about what women can do.” Or in “Treacherous Twins,” where Drake and 21 characterize their close, yet problematic, friendship over the 1996 sample of Ginuwine’s “Lonely Daze.” The toxic dependency on a loved one connects the two songs thematically and makes the track whole.
Some of the sonic genius packed into the album is courtesy of Atlanta rapper and producer Lil Yachty. Lil Boat produced six of the tracks on the album, but his presence is all-encompassing. It is most immediately felt on “BackOutsideBoyz” and “Jumbotron Shit Poppin,” where he directly contributes in the chorus and raps in the verses. Yachty’s signature ad libs echo in “Pussy & Millions,” and Travis Scott plays his part in flooding the beat with reverb washes, creating a larger than life sound that was made to be a hit with the clubs and festivals alike. Clearly, Yachty is taking his producer era in stride.
No song is more of a sonic standout on “Her Loss” than “Broke Boys.” The producer Avengers assemble (including Wheezy and Tay Keith) for a heavy-hitting, 808-booming, OVO classic. The beat is intentionally overbearing, but the rapping does not get lost in translation. 21 Savage’s energetic verse begins with the call: “Woah, I got more stripes than Adidas,” which is met with Drake response: “Yeah, I got the stripes, but fuck Adidas,” reminiscent of 21 Savage’s whisper verse on Metro Boomin’s “Don’t Come Out The House.” The intensity of the song’s first half is replaced with a fast-paced, keyboard trill after the beat switch, the change-up mirrored by Drake’s high-tempo bars. The opening beat sees Drake’s signature vocals echo in the earworm repetition of “You know where this shit 'bout to go,” and the switch helps to pick up where Part I left off with the repetitive line “I can't talk to broke boys.” Hands-down, “Nobody touchin the flow” on this track.
It would be fatal not to mention “Her Loss’”s role in the context of Drake’s immediately previous albums. It’s hard not to compare the album’s overall production to 2022 tracks like “Jimmy Cooks” — which stuck out like a sore thumb in the midst of “Honestly, Nevermind,” and was by far the standout hit on the album. In the hindsight of “Her Loss,” it is clear to see that “Jimmy Cooks” was more of a prelude that offered a glimpse into his next project. Some fans may stand their ground that “Honestly Nevermind” was a filler album of unnecessary experimentation, while others yet see it as a testament to Drake’s adaptability and willingness to abstract from his sound. Wherever one may fall on the spectrum of discourse, it is clear that “Her Loss” sees Drake in a new yet familiar light, and proves him to be a stylistic chameleon who is learning from his discography.
In just over an hour, Drake proves himself in many ways. He cements his role as wingman MC to 21, reinforcing their already close bond. He confirms his artistic continuity, the ability to learn and grow from album to album. And he honors the legacy of his discography in the songwriting, which seamlessly threads in previous themes of love, enemies, and fame.

In SZA’s newest single “Shirt,” self-awareness carries bittersweet tones as her honey-smooth voice strolls along to the song’s slow-rocking beat. She sings about longing, betrayal, and the perennial quest for self-love. In the accompanying music video, SZA expands on these themes in a Bonnie-and-Clyde storyline filled with past selves and interdimensional hauntings.
For fans of SZA, this song has been a test of patience. A snippet of it was teased in December 2020 and subsequently went viral on YouTube and TikTok. In true SZA style, the snippet was also featured in the music video of her previous single “Good Days,” but it took two years for the song to be released in its entirety.
Fortunately, it is well worth the wait. SZA’s emotional lyrics approach introspection in a way that remains cautiously optimistic without glossing over the darker sides of self-healing. Images of growth are tempered with recognitions of failure as she sings: “Broad day, sunshine, I'll find a way to fuck it up still/ Can't cry about the shit that I can't change/ Just my mind, gotta get outta here.” In the music video, this concept is conveyed by the actions SZA and her partner (played by actor Lakeith Stanfield) repeat through different lifetimes; the concept is the singer’s take on the ever-popular multiverse trope.
At its core, the song is about working through trauma and finding comfort in the difficult process of healing. Her lyrics evoke concepts of the shadow self, showing how inner darkness can become a space of freedom and acceptance: “In the dark right now / Feeling lost, but I like it / Comfort in my sins, and all about me.”
This introspection can be seen in the way she deals with sexuality. In fact, in the snippet teased in the “Good Days” video, she pole dances in a gas station, lit by the soft hues of purplish-pink neon lights. In the full song, she begins the single with a sultry, longing whisper to “Kiss me, dangerous,” but her song instead takes the focus off of her lover “you” and digs within SZA’s inner psyche. She unpacks her feelings with surprising shifts as the erotic tension of “simmer in my skin” is instead attributed to “the taste of resentment.” As she says at the start of her music video, “everything is energy.” She explores the different ways in which emotions, feelings, and even selfhoods bleed into and influence one another.
Ultimately, the central image of “Blood stain on my shirt” reflects this mixing of energies by taking on multiple interpretations. It is a symbol of inner pain, unrestrained love, or even betrayal — as depicted in the music video when her partner shoots her. Her unhurried voice threads together these many feelings in a track that remains strangely soothing despite its serious subject. The difficult and oftentimes complicated journey to self-healing finds itself mapped out in the contours of her voice: It swells, falters, wavers, and cracks, but it remains undeniably melodic, finding harmonies as it goes.

When it comes to music, Jess Shoman doesn’t see the point in creating alone. They are the lead singer of Tenci, a band founded in Shoman’s bedroom in 2018 that has been expanding ever since. Shoman is no stranger to creating community; even from an early age, they acknowledge their wish to create and collaborate with others.
“I've always wished that I came from a super musical family,” Shoman reflected recently in an interview with The Harvard Crimson.
Despite this early lack of a familial music community, Shoman’s childhood still held important influences for their development as a musician. Tenci’s name is derived from the nickname of Shoman’s grandmother, Hortencia, who served as an important influence on the singer growing up.
“My grandma's not a musician,” Shoman said. “But I remember always hearing her singing while she was doing chores. She has this really beautiful, romantic vibrato and I feel like I at first subtly started mimicking that. Our voices are similar in that way.”
The organic way that Shoman found their sound also extends to how they found their band. When describing the Chicago community, Shoman emphasized that “it's pretty close knit” — they met all of the members of Tenci through DIY shows and performing in the same circles. “When Tenci started playing shows back in 2018, 2019, Kurt had a DIY space in their basement. And we played a show there, and I met Kurt, who is also in a band with Izzy. Joey I met because I went to one of his shows,” Shoman said. “We just hit it off right away.”
It’s safe to say that with Tenci, Shoman has found their long-sought musical family. “We are just the biggest goofs ever, we’re constantly laughing,” Shoman said. “We're able to stay very light-hearted and not take things very seriously. And I think that really helps us get through things together. Everyone in the band is so caring and thoughtful and communicative. They truly are some of my best friends. They stick with you through everything. I think it's rare that that happens.”
Despite Tenci’s strong dynamic, Shoman usually opts to begin the writing process independently, on their own time. “I'm constantly writing in my notes app on my phone, and constantly recording little snippets of voice memos,” they said. “I think lyrically, I usually start with a more dumbed down version of what a song will eventually be. Then I go back, and it's like a puzzle.”
After consolidating their preliminary brainstorming, Shoman is comfortable enough with the band to open things up from there. “I'll bring the songs to the band in their skeletal form, and together, we'll just add, start playing around with them and just start shaping it and molding it from there,” Shoman said. “It's super collaborative.”
Shoman is especially grateful to have a group of musicians that are open to this type of joint effort, and attributes much of Tenci’s sound and success to the other band members’ interpretations of what Shoman themself brings to the table.
“I think that makes it more special for me, how the music's just naturally formed from what I'm trying to say,” she said.
A favorite song of Shoman’s comes from Tenci’s first album, “My Heart is an Open Field.” The song, “No Wings,” is a perfect example of Shoman’s ability to entrust vulnerable material to their band, and the emotional benefits of this workshopping experience. “The actual topic of the song is pretty traumatic for me,” Shoman said. “The way that the song sounds turns it around, and is very lighthearted and playful, really helps me get through that trauma and process things. Now when I play it, I'm having such a great time. I feel like I rewrote my narrative, a little bit. And that is pretty powerful for me. We always have a good time playing it.”
Tenci’s debut LP, “My Heart is an Open Field,” is a fluid collaboration between the band’s personnel, and many other artists involved in the Chicago music scene. The album as a whole could be loosely categorized as indie music, however, it also invokes many rock and folk elements that make it somewhat difficult to place. Shoman confirmed that “My Heart is an Open Field'' was produced in a tight time frame — the entire project was recorded in roughly two months. With Tenci’s second album, “A Swollen River, A Well Overflowing,” Shoman commented that the timeline was looser, and includes material that the band has been developing for over two years.
“I would say having more time with the second album, I had a little more room to play,” Shoman said. “I definitely had a little more room to think about what I was doing, and really be intentional about the different musical elements. Since with this new record we didn’t have any featured people, it was just us four in the band to play it on the record, basically. We were kind of just in our own little world.”
The band plans to embark on a 40-city tour following the Nov. 4 release of Tenci’s second album. With the growth of Tenci’s platform over recent years, Shoman has begun to wrap their head around their expanding fan base.
“When people come up to me and say anything about liking the band, it's always very thoughtful, and I'm always really surprised that people like it, even though that's silly to say out loud,” Shoman said. “We've had a couple people come up and they've had tears in their eyes. The fans I've met have been very sensitive and emotional and sweet. And I really appreciate that vulnerability.”
Along with a profound appreciation for the band’s listeners, Shoman has also been intentional about supporting the local music communities at Tenci’s tour venues. “We've decided to book locals for all the individual shows,” Shoman said. “It's always more fun to me when a bunch of locals are on the show, just because I really get to get a glimpse into what the community is like, and I feel like we can share that together. I hand-picked most of them and did a lot of digging and research and listening to music. So I'm very excited to finally get to hear it all live.”
Although Shoman acknowledges the many stressors of going on tour, they’re also approaching the upcoming few months with anticipation and experience. Among the many packing lists, boxes, and logistics to remember, Shoman shared their tour motto — “once you're in the car, you can't look back.”
Tenci performed live in Cambridge at the Lilypad on Friday, Nov. 11. After the upcoming tour, Shoman foresees a return of Tenci to its roots — that of natural collaboration and spending quality time as a band. “I hope that we can just have fun playing music very loosely,” Shoman said. “I’d say next year, we’ll be entering a more experimental stage of how we want Tenci to evolve.”

Ava Salzman ’23’s guitar case sits propped open against the wall of Eliot House dorm. Sitting upright is a Rodrigo classical acoustic guitar, suited with a pickup and a black strap with rainbow and white geometry. When Salzman plays here, her legs dangle off the side of her bed and the guitar reverberates around the small room, decorated with handmade open mic signs. Her fingers, most of them hugged by metal rings, pick the strings, or move up and down the fretboard. The harmonics are like bells, her voice emotional and stately.
Salzman, who also goes by the name Ava Jinying in her work as an artist, says her first album, not yet named, will most likely be released in the spring. It deals with monstrosity, turning the abstract and intangible into something with a form. In her song “Snakeskin,” a song about the struggles of transitioning into adulthood, she equates herself to a metal snake. She sings about the cycles of growth, and feeling trapped inside herself, trying to figure out how to change.
This song is not yet recorded. For now, she plays “Snakeskin” and other originals around Harvard’s campus: At the Harvard Signet Society for open mics she hosts with friends, outside at markets, or at Eliot House’s Tiny Desk series. She currently has two songs released on Spotify. One of them, “Guai,” will be a part of this new album.
Salzman is comfortable with the guitar. She started playing when she was six after watching a video of Johnny Cash playing “Long Black Veil.” She liked Cash’s charisma and his powerful presence, and decided she wanted to be just like him.
Her teacher was a blues guy, according to Salzman. He preferred to play by ear rather than just reading music. Lessons started with learning songs she wanted to play, like “I love Rock ‘n’ Roll” by Joan Jett, and of course, “Long Black Veil.” But that changed as she got older.
She describes a shift in her ability when she was around 12. Her uncle introduced her to guitar players known for their complicated and stirring guitar solos, legends like Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page from Led Zeppelin.
“Oh my gosh, I have to learn how to play this thing,” she remembers thinking.
In middle school, she played in a punk band, and started writing songs when she was 13, playing open mics at farmers markets.
“Then, it was just pure self expression and it was really fun,” she said. “I think I kind of took it for granted for a while in that I was just doing it constantly, but I didn’t realize how much of a life force it really was until it was one of the only things I had.”
Sometimes, she played the open mics with her dad, a cellist, and her younger sister on vocals; they arranged covers together. With her mom, Salzman went to concerts and smaller shows in her hometown of Los Angeles throughout high school.
“She didn’t play music herself,” Salzman said about her mom. “But she was so passionate about creating spaces for music.”
Salzman remembers having music nights at their house in Los Angeles, when 30 or 40 of their family friends would come over, each with their own instrument, and play music. They flowed between the food room with tables full of chicken and noodles, bok choy, dumplings, and mu shu pork from the Green Dragon — an L.A. favorite — and the music room where people sat in the living room on sofas, or at the step of the fireplace. Performances ranged from a young boy practicing his trumpet routine, to people getting back into music after a long break, to professional singer-songwriters trying out new songs. Nearing the end of the night, they would all join in, singing or playing, for a few songs. Sometimes it was Ah-ha’s “Take On Me,” or “Let Down” by Radiohead, or a campy version of the Beatles “Let it Be.”
During this time of her life, Salzman played music every day. After a long day at school, she did her homework, ate dinner, and used the rest of the evening to play the guitar, to decompress and process.
After getting to Harvard however, that daily dedication wasn’t as much of a priority in the fluster of being a first year. She thought she wanted to study evolutionary biology. She may not have realized differently if the Covid-19 pandemic didn’t send her home nearing the end of her freshman year.
“Up until that point, I think I was a person who really thrived and felt comfortable when I was in environments that I knew,” she said.
But all that went away.
“I was really faced with the concept that when everything else goes to waste, who really, who, who am I?” Salzman said.
Sometime near Thanksgiving, she was sitting at the keyboard in the too small apartment she lived in with six friends and a dog, all doing online school, feeling unstable, aimless, and helpless. The only thing she felt she could do to make sense of it all was write a song.
She picked up the guitar again.
In September of this year, Salzman performed some of her original songs for her fellow house residents in the Eliot library. She wore a white shirt, white jeans, black boots and a chunky necklace as past Harvard presidents looked out at her from their framed homes on the wall.
For two of her three songs, she performed on her own, with her acoustic guitar hanging from a strap around her shoulders. In these songs, she began with a classical intro, and used the melodic notes to highlight her vocals. She’s especially mastered the bridges of her songs, knowing how to build suspense and emotion through change in both her lyrics and her guitar’s rhythm.
She wondered if people were going to get her lyrics, understand the words she put so much time into. After the show, people told her about the journey her songs took them on, and that they felt those tumultuous feelings she sings about.
They got it.
Salzman played with a cellist on “Snakeskin.” Collaborating on her music is something that she has no problem with. She finds in her experience so far that allowing other people's musical talent into her process of creating a song elevates it beyond a point that she could get to by herself.
When she’s looking to collaborate, she writes the music on her own and the arrangements for the other instruments, then asks the people she's asked to work with her to use the arrangement to do whatever they’d like.
During one performance, she played her song “Feel,” accompanied by a friend on the drums. The beat of the song is funky and hard hitting, and shifts slightly during the solo. The drummer made a bigger shift though, into a Bossa Nova beat.
“I would've never thought of that,” she said. “Now, I like it 10 times better than I previously did.”
She finds satisfaction in collaboration. The wall of her dorm’s hallway features a collage of her detailed graphite drawings of rhinos and giraffes, and her roommates' creative creatures with spirally limbs. She enjoys her role as a proctor for the First-year Art program (or FAP) because she gets to witness the beginnings of musical collaborations.
“I did get to drift around and see what friendships people were making over music,” the singer said. “It was such a beautiful thing to see. I love being able to witness people bringing their talents together in different contexts and making something new for people to see.”
In the same way she sees collaboration with other artists elevating a piece of songwriting, she takes special interest in merging her own visual arts with her songwriting as well. For example, the songs she is working on for her album all relate to monstrosity in some way.
“Whenever I was faced with emotions, or situations that felt overwhelming to me and I couldn’t confront them directly I think that my first impulse was always to draw monsters,” she said. “Monsters were on my way growing up, taking something scary because it's intangible and abstract and giving a form to it and by doing that, you somehow make it less scary.”
She sees this sort of coping mechanism as a way of taking care of her emotional state. She still creates monsters through art, and has started writing songs about them.
In “Guai,” Salzman samples an interview from a Vietnamese Buddhist Monk talking about Hungry Ghosts, which represent the spirits of people who have nobody left alive to remember them. She came across this throughout her childhood, celebrating Chinese traditions where families leave out food for their ancestors.
“Once you have been forgotten, then if you have nobody left to feed you, then you become hungry and you become sort of monstrous,” she said. “And I think one thing that I've been thinking about a lot in my art is how to reconcile with painful pasts and things that we can't undo and people that we have erased.”
She creates the art that serves as the covers for her published pieces, and plans on using animations to create videos to go along with them too.
“I'm realizing now, I think that [music] is going to take a much more important role than I had previously thought in my life,” she said. “I just, I love it. Yeah. I love it more than anything else.”

It should come as no surprise that “The Effect,” running from Nov. 10 through Nov. 13, is turning the Ex at the Loeb Drama Center from a stage into a literal hospital ward. After all, if there is a guiding principle behind the show, it is the unity of vision: A bold pursuit of realism and emotion on stage.
“The Effect” is a 2012 play written by the British playwright Lucy Prebble, who domestically is perhaps best known as one of the writers and executive producers for HBO’s “Succession.” At its core, it’s a simple story. Tristan (Robbie S. Owen ’25) and Connie (Tia A. KwanBock ’25), two volunteers in the clinical trial for an antidepressant drug, fall in love and begin to wonder if the feeling is real or a side effect of the medication. Meanwhile, the trial’s overseer, Dr. Lorna James (Sophie M. Garrigus ’25) tries to grapple with the trial’s ethics and her past relationship with her colleague, Dr. Toby Sealey (Benjamin H. Crawford ’25). All to the tune of a completely original score composed by Kaia B. Berman Peters ’23-’24.
“It's a really beautiful, moving piece, and I think it's just a type of theater that we need more of on Harvard's campus,” said Matthew W. Cole ’24, the show’s hair and makeup designer.
The quality is in no small part due to the strength of what Garrigus called “hyperrealistic dialogue and characters.”
“It's such a gift to get to be subtle on stage,” Garrigus added.
Garrigus’s co-star, Owen, likewise appreciated the source material.
“It’s two parallel love affairs,” Owen said. “The show runs in parallel all the time. A lot of that's done by genius directing … [things] come back later on in the show, but with different changes of dynamics.”
The parallel storylines and the changes of dynamics highlight one of “The Effect”’s crucial facets: Under a veneer of simplicity lies a surprising technical, narrative, and emotional complexity.
“It's a very intimate show in many ways: Pure raw emotion, actual intimacy, actual breakdowns. There's all kinds of things that go on,” Crawford said.
Co-director Mira S. Alpers ’24 shares the sentiment. “It puts you in a position where you just have to hold something and grapple with it,” she said.
The show’s diminutive cast of just four might suggest an equally small production team. But the show’s behind-the-scenes hide the same complexity as the story.
“People who come to see the show might think… it's not some crazy huge theater set. They might be fooled into believing that there was not as big of a team behind it, but this is such a technically ambitious show and there's a lot of people working to make it happen,” Cole said.
There’s a reason why the amount of work on the side of the production team can be hard to see: Their aim, and the end result, was a minimalistic set design. “The best thing I can do is just not distract from the artistic vision that's surrounding the rest of the show,” Cole said.
This quality-over-quantity approach results in a great attention to the tiniest details — all the way down to the three cans of Canada Dry Ginger Ale standing on a shelf of a hospital tray — that contributes to a sense of authenticity.
“The white sterility of the floor, the platform, the beds, all of it really works together in a cohesive way that I think really allows a lot of creativity while still maintaining a focus on the realism of the hospital setting,” said lighting designer Joshua G. Caven ’25.
The set design works in unison with the show’s venue — the rather compact Loeb Ex — to create, in the words of Kyra S. Siegel ’25, the show’s co-director, an “immersive experience.”’
“We wanted it to feel like it was simultaneously people being watched in a really scary way because they're being experimented on, but also feeling like the audience and the performers are connected in a way that makes it feel like there is no separation, that there is no performance,” Siegel said.
“The Effect”’s emphasis on reality and creating an engrossing, believable experience is no accident.
“I do things that are intimate and I'm interested in one thing, and that's the complexity of interpersonal relationships,” Alpers said.
“We're really into things that feel real,” Siegel said.
And so, when last March the two decided to produce a play together, the choice was not hard. “We knew we wanted to do something small. And this play in particular stood out to me, not just because the themes are really interesting, but because I think Lucy Prebble is just a master of dialogue,” Alpers said.
Now, courtesy of Alpers, Siegel, and the rest of the team, the show with all of its realism and masterful dialogue has a chance to shine at a Harvard stage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, a Daily Beast report alleged that Herschel Walker, the Georgia football legend and Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, encouraged and paid for his girlfriend’s abortion in 2009.
As far as explosive allegations go, this was — or should have been — meteoric. A staunchly pro-life candidate, who in the spring called for no exceptions to abortion bans for rape, incest, or the health of the mother (a position he later softened), was allegedly guilty of violating the most sacred of conservative bona fides.
And if it wasn’t stunning by itself, it was only the tip of the iceberg of Walker’s hypocrisy. A passionate opponent of absentee fatherhood throughout his campaign, Walker was forced to confirm that he is the absentee father of multiple children. A fierce advocate for family values, Walker had to weather a callout from his own son, a conservative activist who claimed that his father forced him and his mother “to move over 6 times in 6 months” to escape the threat of domestic violence.
If Walker were a vegan, he would be the carnivorous kind.
None of this has stopped the GOP from packaging Walker as a true conservative. He is the GOP’s Georgian darling, at least until the Dec. 6 runoff against Senator Raphael Warnock and possibly far longer.
In all likelihood, the Senate will be controlled by razor-thin margins, and Walker’s candidacy represents one of a few key prospects for Republicans to gain control. In this context, a vote for Walker needn’t actually be a vote for Walker. For most, it is wholly aimed at securing the votes he will deliver in the Senate. Conservative activist Dana Loesch was most succinct on this point: “I don’t care if Herschel Walker paid to abort endangered baby eagles. I want control of the Senate.”
Republicans in Georgia have no real candidate — only his positions — to cling to with excitement. But I bring Walker up not to further lambaste his stupefying hypocrisy or malign voters who support him. Instead, I aim to draw attention to a much larger incentive problem in our politics, one that is true for the Left, too: Voting for Walker and people like him is a perfectly rational choice for conservatives — arguably the only one.
I’ll easily grant that policy matters more than politicians. From any place on the political spectrum, a flawed messenger of a good idea is better than a pure messenger of a bad one. But it should raise eyebrows for all of us when conservatives who preach the sanctity of prenatal life and family cohesion are compelled by necessity to support candidates who utterly disregard their most cherished ideals.
It’s easy to extrapolate Walker’s insincerity to the voters who got him here — after all, this is a democracy — but this is vastly reductive, unfair, and useless. We won’t arrive at better political outcomes by belittling millions of people. And doing so would obscure the fact that the political system in which we operate consistently implores all of us, voters and leaders alike, to make poor choices.
Bad incentives lead to bad outcomes all across our electoral process. In single-party primaries, more extreme candidates often seek to prove their partisan purity and impress pundits and interest groups. And when extreme candidates are selected by their respective parties, the high stakes of a one-on-one race don’t allow for anything less than unequivocal support all the way up through the finish.
When parties must support their extreme nominees in lockstep, it sets a clear standard: even moderate politicians must toe the party line. There is little incentive to moderate or compromise, and dissenting can bear with it huge political costs. But political benefits can be found elsewhere. Instead, politicians are rewarded for flashy sound bites, appeasing party leadership, and pandering to prominent interest groups. The high visibility and concentration of lawmakers on platforms like Twitter further raise the cost of breaking ranks. So, too, does the top-down rule of party leadership in Congress, where that cost is removal from committees and stunted opportunities for advancement.
What does our vast incentive problem mean for Herschel Walker? Despite all my grievances, this is not really about him. He is a case study — a representation of one of the bad outcomes that occur everywhere in our political system. And though his hypocrisy is more overt and staggering than that of most politicians, his viable candidacy in many ways vividly illustrates how a well-intentioned political system can damage itself when weaknesses are left to ferment.
Like the rest of our bad outcomes, it’s generally neither fair nor productive to expend energy chastising the voters who chose Walker. Here at Harvard and beyond, we must encourage a shift in paradigm, looking beyond just our politicians and towards the much larger forces that select and debase them.
Don’t take Herschel Walker’s candidacy as a fundamental indictment of Republican voters or the state of Georgia. Instead, focus on the system that transformed an awful candidate into a legitimate and likely choice for the Senate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor's Note: The following piece includes discussion of severe mental health struggles and suicide. We’ve compiled a few resources that might be useful to any readers in need of help or support. Please make sure to take care of yourselves — seeking help is always worthwhile.
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a hotline for individuals in crisis or for those looking to help someone else. To speak with a certified listener, call 1-800-273-8255.
If you are enrolled, Harvard's Counseling and Mental Health Services offers no cost support, including Urgent Care appointments at (617) 495-5711.
For international students, here’s a list of some internationally available support hotlines that might be helpful.
— Guillermo S. Hava and Eleanor V. Wikstrom, Editorial Chairs
— Raquel Coronell Uribe, President
In September 2015, tragedy struck Harvard’s campus when Luke Z. Tang ’18, a student in Lowell House, died by suicide. Three years later, Tang’s father filed a lawsuit alleging that several Harvard employees — including residential dean Catherine R. Shapiro, former Lowell Resident Dean Caitlin M. Casey ’03, and Counseling and Mental Health Services employee Melanie G. Northrop — displayed “negligence” in the case of his son. Last week, Harvard attorneys argued that the school’s actions did not rise to the legal definition of negligence, and that these named affiliates had no liability in Tang’s death.
A student died by suicide on Harvard’s watch — and Harvard claims to have sufficiently fulfilled its duty of care.
We wish to express our utmost sympathy and support to Tang’s family as they navigate this painful case. We can’t speak to the law here — its sterilized conceptions of negligence and liability, its calculated assignment and dismissal of blame — but as a student community who mourned the loss of Luke Tang seven years ago, the gut-wrenching impact of this case is clear. Harvard’s defense, and its equation of “duty” with what seems to be a bare-bones minimum standard of care, is not what we expect from our school. If Harvard fulfilled its duties in Tang’s case — despite the University’s failure to ensure Tang was undergoing treatment upon his return to campus after a recorded suicide attempt the previous semester, and the expectation that he would reach out proactively for help, as outlined in the complaint — then the content of those “duties” must be thoroughly reconsidered.
There’s no other way to express it: Watching this litigation unfold is heartbreaking. By affirming the notion that those entrusted with our care for four years have no responsibility, in terms of basic human compassion, to reach out to students who have previously expressed suicidal ideation, the University sends a message that our well-being only matters insofar as it is a liability.
Infusing compassion into Harvard’s mental health care is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. Harvard must adopt an approach to mental health care that includes preemptive outreach for those it knows have previously struggled with or acted upon suicidal ideation. The burden should not fall on students suffering mental health crises to seek help; case managers should not consider their duties fulfilled simply because an at-risk student has failed to explicitly ask them for help. Focusing on preemptive care will ensure that students struggling with suicidal ideation receive the care they require.
Putting students above legalistic bureaucracy also means treating us like individuals.
Mental illness is as varied as the people it affects; there’s no one-size-fits-all response to depression. Taking a leave of absence, for example, can help some students gain clarity and peace while removing others from their support systems at the risk of worsening their mental health. Policies surrounding mental health need to be flexible.
But policies are not enough — culture matters, too. Harvard’s hyper-competitive, sometimes toxic culture can often push us to figure things out on our own instead of asking for help. On our campus, the necessarily stressful separation from family and transition to adulthood combines with an extraordinary academic pressure — and more broadly, on campuses across the country, it combines with a generational despair. The product is a proliferation of mental health crises, year after year, among a demographic that must already contend with sparse on-campus resources.
We want a university that sees us as people to be cared for, not liabilities to be managed. Harvard’s response to the lawsuit takes care to distinguish University students as young adults rather than children, implying that we somehow deserve less care and attention as a result. But that respect for young adult autonomy seems to disappear when Harvard urges students to leave campus and then dictates the terms of their return through University Health Services riders or other means. We don’t want a university that shifts its view of us according to convenience.
When we struggle, we deserve dignity and support. We don’t deserve to be seen as a burden. Perhaps more concretely, we will find it a lot easier to ask for help if we feel that doing so triggers Harvard’s genuine care for our wellbeing. Students in crisis should not have to worry about whether the University’s interests are aligned with their own.
It has been seven years since Tang’s death, but many of the issues surrounding Harvard’s handling of his case still linger today. Regardless of the legalities of the case, given the College’s less-than-optimal mental health care infrastructure, we fear student trust in these resources will only be further reduced by Harvard’s cold, legalistic response. Most concerningly, if Harvard’s logic continues to assert that everything is fine unless students explicitly reach out for help, then on paper, this campus may not experience any mental health struggles at all — a crude calculation of liability with the potential to be dangerous.

Cass R. Sunstein ’75 is the Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard, where he established the Program on Behavioral Economics and Public Policy at the Law School. He was awarded the Holberg Prize in 2018, described by some as the Nobel Prize for the social sciences and the humanities. Outside of academia, Sunstein served as the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
FM: Where is your favorite place that you’ve lived? Chicago, D.C., Cambridge?
CRS: Massachusetts. Of all the places I’ve lived, my favorite is Concord, Massachusetts, And of all the places I’ve worked, my favorite is Cambridge, Massachusetts.
FM: Why is that?
CRS: Cambridge just has a combination of energy and sense, meaning there’s a lot of intellectual energy, people are full of ideas. There are nice restaurants, it isn’t too crowded, it’s pleasant, and also you can find what you need there. I’ve lived in New York, which is amazing, but a little overwhelming to me. And I’ve lived in Chicago, which I really like, but Cambridge is better than any workplace I’ve lived.
FM: At Harvard, you’re not just a professor at the Law School — you also teach a Gen Ed, “Making Change When Change Is Hard.” What inspired you to teach that course? And why do you enjoy the opportunity to teach undergrads?
CRS: It grew out of a course that my wife and I created a few years ago. We had come out of the government; she was in the area of foreign policy, and I was in the area of domestic policy. And we thought that we had learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t to make change, and that there would both be general lessons from particular events and also there might be enduring lessons from events in the last 40 years, some of which we were privileged to be observers of or participants in. We both thought that undergraduates have brilliance, of course, because it’s Harvard, but also they have a kind of openness to ideas of their own that maybe are completely original. When you’re in grad school you might be a little more careful, which is amazing and fantastic. But there’s something fantastic about people who are willing to think something completely fresh.
FM: You teach Gen Eds with large lecture halls of undergraduates, but I know that you’ve also appeared to testify before congressional committees quite a few times. What’s scarier: facing a crowd of undergraduates asking you questions or a panel of Congresspeople?
CRS: Well, what’s scary is playing for Harvard Squash for the national title. That’s scary. Or what’s scary is — right now I’m faculty fellow to the squash teams — getting on the court with someone on the men’s or women’s teams. Those are scary things. Teaching a large class is, to me, exciting, and testifying is a privilege. Testifying as an academic really isn’t scary at all. It’s an opportunity, and you want to be helpful, and it’s not a scary thing. If you’re testifying as a public official, you’re representing the administration for which you work, and you want to make sure that you don’t cast anything in a bad light.
FM: When did your love for squash come about? And how long have you been playing it exactly?
CRS: Well, on my first day on the planet, my dad took me to a squash court and had me watch the finals of a local tournament. And I was crying — you know, I was just out of the womb, so I was crying a lot. But as soon as I heard the bounce of the ball, I started to calm down. And even though I was only one day old, I smiled, which was very unusual. Okay, that’s all made up. None of that is true. [laughs] I started to play squash at Middlesex School in Concord, and I started to play regularly in eighth grade. And I just loved it. I love the fact that it was fast and that there were lots of decisions to be made in a hurry. It was love at first sight.
FM: Do you frequently attend Harvard squash games? 
CRS: I have, through the years. In my current capacity, my family’s in Washington, D.C., so I commute back and forth. I do get down there these days, at least once a week. And I see that the team at Harvard has fantastic tradition and squash. They’ve won national titles on multiple occasions, both on the women’s side and the men’s side. I saw them very recently, and they look terrific.
FM: Going back to your Gen Ed, “Making Change When Change Is Hard,” any advice on what could possibly need to be changed at Harvard?
CRS: Well, I mean, most of my work is really about public policy. So I work on health and safety issues, I work on environmental issues, and higher education isn’t something that I’ve taught or studied aside from being lucky enough to be part of an institution of higher education. My observation of those parts of Harvard that I’m privileged to see is just very favorable. The students are amazing, the faculty is tremendous, the range and diversity of opportunities for students is out of sight. From what I’m observing in my classes and just as I walk around Cambridge, it’s a tremendous institution. [dog barks in the background] And my dog is very much in agreement with that.
FM: Dogs or cats?
CRS: Dogs. I honor cats and their existence, and I wish them well, but dogs have captured my heart. You’re hearing two of them.
FM: What are their names?
CRS: They’re Labrador Retrievers, and one is Snow and [the other is] Finley. And you can hear them being fed because I take orders from them and they are very insistent that I do my job, which is to feed them.
FM: That is definitely the priority. So I know that you have lived in quite a few big baseball cities. Boston, Massachusetts is one of them. Are you a fan of any team? 
CRS: I have been all my life a big Red Sox fan. But the current Red Sox I’ve followed with less intensity than past Red Sox. I have a deep emotional commitment to the Red Sox, but I don’t have a deep understanding of the 2022 season.
FM: This past summer, the Supreme Court made the decision on Dobbs, overturning Roe. They are currently hearing the case on race-conscious admissions, and that has the strong likelihood of being overturned as well this coming summer. What would you say to young people who have become a bit disillusioned with the law, the courts? Why do we still need to study them and respect them?
CRS: The rule of law is fundamental to a free society. The law ensures background conditions for freedom from violence, for free speech, for freedom of religion, for an ability to get from one place to another without people putting you behind some bars unless you’ve done something that warrants that. And the law is an instrument that can be used for great good and is being used for great good every day. It’s being used today to protect the environment, to protect people’s personhoods against people who want to hurt them or take something from them. It’s being used today to help keep the water clean. It’s being used today to help keep workers safer than they would otherwise be. The precondition for much of what we take for granted, so the fact that Harvard students are able to have various things that, in the arc of human history, are great, in terms of opportunities, liberties, and resources — the law has everything to do with all of those things. So if one doesn’t like the direction of the Supreme Court of the United States, the law allows you to say that, to explain to the Supreme Court itself why you think it’s gone in the wrong direction, of course, through lawyers, but also through The Crimson or through newspapers. And then the law is essential to study so we can maintain its best features and improve on those features that aren’t so good. There are a lot of people who are celebrating the new conservative Supreme Court, and it was sought by people in the political process for decades; they’ve gotten there. I’m not in agreement with the central directions of the current Supreme Court, but that should intensify our interest if you also are not in agreement and trying to make things better.
FM: I know that you clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall, way back in 1979 to 1980. Are there any lessons from your time clerking for Justice Marshall that you believe can be used to inspire or give young people hope that not all is lost?
CRS: Well, keep in mind that young people have very diverse political views and very diverse views about the law. A lot of young people are enthusiastic about the conservative direction of the court. So for them, what we’re seeing now is hopeful, and the liberal court of the 1960s and 1970s is both ancient history and worrisome. For young people who think that the current direction is not a good one, Marshall thought that you use the best arguments you have. And sometimes you’re going to lose, especially with people who are not inclined to agree with you. But you use the best arguments you have, and you win sometimes. Marshall, on a conservative court, won a lot. Not as much as he would have wanted. But he won a lot on civil rights issues and free speech issues, issues involving sex discrimination. He was in dissent frequently, but it may be the fact that he was in dissent was noticed by the majority and led them to greater caution than we would have otherwise seen. That’s probably true. So I think the thing to think, if you don’t like the direction of the court, is that in every 10-year period, the court switches significantly. And whether the court is going to switch in 2032 from where it is now depends on a lot of things, including what kind of arguments people make. It was a quite conservative court that said the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. And there we were, and the arguments seemed to the majority to be convincing.
FM: I know that you were an undergrad at Harvard who played squash, but what I only recently learned was that you were also a member of a certain semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization, otherwise known as the Lampoon. Did you enjoy your time on the Harvard Lampoon?
CRS: Since 1876 or something, Harvard has been blessed to have a terrific publication that is both journalism and humor. It’s news and sports. It’s technology, it’s music. It’s the breeding ground for the journalists who have defined American journalism. And the fact that Harvard’s only had one outlet has been okay, because the outlet is so spectacular. The fact that Harvard has had so many opportunities with respect to sports and so many courses you can take and majors, and the fact that it has only had one publication for all these years — that is the Lampoon, that’s okay because the Lampoon is so great. If you want to do interviews, or if you want to do stories on politics, or if you want to do something about Taylor Swift, or if you want to do something about political campaigns — the Lampoon is where everyone goes. So its universality, I think, is why it redeems its uniqueness at Harvard. Other universities, they have a humor magazine plus a newspaper, maybe a daily newspaper. Harvard just has the Lampoon, but —
FM: Professor Sunstein, this Q&A is going to become unpublishable!
CRS: Okay, so, The Crimson is magnificent, needless to say —
FM: Okay, now we can run the piece.
CRS: There is the Lampoon and The Crimson, like LeBron James and Michael Jordan, and they’re both really good. And which is better? They’re different. The Lampoon ... it’s complicated, isn’t it? Humor is complicated. When I was there, there were people of unbelievable talent who became really famous in the world in which they wrote — not famous like Taylor Swift is famous — but famous in the worlds in which they wrote. And they did that because they were so talented, so this is what they ended up doing for their lives. And they were really great at humor. When I pick up the Lampoon now — which is every morning and every night, I basically spend focusing on the Lampoon. And Christmas. My family, we all just read the Lampoon — it’s good, it’s funny.
FM: You never considered a career as a comedian? Were you always set on being a law professor?
CRS: I appreciate that, but I did not.

Like many second-year public policy students at the Harvard Kennedy School, Bethan M. Saunders was nervous about finding someone to serve as her policy analysis exercise advisor. But she also had a dream candidate in mind: former U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter.
At the start of the fall semester, Saunders spotted Carter walking down a hall in the Kennedy School and chased him down, shouting, “Professor Carter, Professor Carter.” After chatting about their summers, Saunders told Carter about an idea she was really excited about for the policy analysis exercise — and eventually worked up the courage to ask him to serve as her advisor.
“‘Yes, of course. I’d be happy to,’” Saunders recalled him saying, leaving her “in complete shock.”
“I was so excited to be working with someone who had such important insights and experience, and really a brilliant scholar and public servant,” Saunders said. “And in hindsight, I shouldn’t have been surprised at all because he cares so much about students, and is incredibly dedicated to developing future leaders, future public servants.”
A lifelong academic and public servant who would go on to serve as the 25th Defense secretary under President Barack Obama, Ashton B. Carter died on Oct. 24 in Boston after suffering a heart attack. He was 68.
Carter was born in Philadelphia on Sept. 24, 1954, the youngest of four children born to William and Ann Carter. A graduate of Abington Senior High School, he studied at Yale University before attending Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.
Cynthia DeFelice, one of Carter’s older sisters, said it took her a while to “catch on to the fact that Ash was really different and destined for big things.”
Carter graduated summa cum laude from Yale College in 1976 with degrees in medieval history and physics. As an undergraduate, Carter was elected to academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa and won Yale’s Andrew D. White Essay Prize in European History. He obtained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics at Oxford in 1979.
While Carter is universally described by friends and colleagues as exceptionally smart, DeFelice maintains that he was “a totally normal kid.”
“He is, at heart, just a goofball,” DeFelice said. “Nobody could make me laugh like my brothers. And my husband would walk in the house and he’d be able to tell that I was talking to Ash, or my brother Chip when he was alive, just by my laughter.”
But his multidisciplinary intellect always shined through. As an adult, she said, he did calculus problems to relax.
“Just recently he had ordered a whole bunch of calculus and physics books to relax with on vacation,” she said.
Carter started his career in the Department of Defense in 1981, just two years after he received his Ph.D. Three years later, he started teaching at Harvard University after he was hired by then-HKS Dean Graham T. Allison ’62 to work as an assistant professor. For much of the next 38 years, Carter would spend his career oscillating between teaching jobs at the Kennedy School in Cambridge and serving in the Defense Department in Washington.
Allison said Carter was “laser smart and really driven by ambition to try to make a difference in the world.” But he added Carter’s brilliance could also make him “anxious — awkward even, many times abrasive, actually, when he was younger — because he was super smart and often dealing with people who didn’t get it.”
At first, it was uncertain if Carter would succeed at the Kennedy School, Allison said, as the school’s initial attempts to focus more on nuclear science and technology were met with skepticism from faculty members. But Carter proved his versatility as a professor, choosing to teach a statistics course in the core curriculum despite his training as a physicist.
“If Ash put his mind to doing something, he could do it,” Allison said.
Carter quickly rose through the ranks at the Kennedy School, becoming the director of the school’s Center for Science and International Affairs in 1990. A year later, following an attempted coup against Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev, Carter formed a working group at HKS that sought to identify a strategy to maintain control over Soviet nuclear weapons in case the country collapsed.
Alongside Steven E. Miller, who currently runs the International Security Program at HKS, Carter authored a monograph titled “Soviet Nuclear Fusion,” which served as their initial answer to that problem. Carter then traveled to Washington, where he successfully lobbied Senators Richard G. Lugar and Samuel A. Nunn to pass legislation inspired by the work.
There were thousands of nuclear weapons left outside of Russia after the Soviet Union collapsed, and it was nearly certain that some of them would end up on the international black market, Allison said.
“What in the world does that look like? So that looks like 9/11 with a nuclear bomb,” Allison said. “And a nuclear bomb — or two, or a dozen — exploding in cities like New York or Boston.”
The afternoon after President Bill Clinton was inaugurated in 1993, he invited Allison to the White House for a meeting where he asked him and Carter to serve in the Defense Department. His administration later implemented their strategies for disarming the former Soviet Union.
R. Nicholas Burns, who currently serves as the U.S. ambassador to China, wrote in an email that he worked with Carter to seek “new relationships” with Russia and Ukraine “at a very different time in history.”
“We worked closely together in the Clinton Administration on U.S. efforts to forge new relationships with Russia and Ukraine after the end of the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact,” Burns wrote.
Carter served as an assistant secretary of Defense in the Clinton administration from 1993 to 1996. He returned to Harvard in 1997, but 12 years later, after Obama was elected, Carter moved back to Washington to serve in the Defense Department again, this time as an undersecretary.
When Carter served in the Obama administration, he had one practice that he took very seriously: He frequently visited troops at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, at a time when hundreds of American soldiers were dying in Afghanistan each year.
Eric B. Rosenbach, who served as Carter’s chief of staff during his time as Defense secretary, said Carter and his wife, Stephanie, “at least once every month, sometimes every weekend, would go and visit folks” at the military hospitals.
In 2015, Obama asked Carter to be the first senior U.S. official to meet with then-Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after the Iran nuclear deal was sealed. In a tense meeting, Netanyahu proceeded to "give Ash the business” about how the deal posed a threat to Israel’s very existence, according to Rosenbach.
But Carter, who attended high school three miles away from Netanyahu’s alma mater, Cheltenham High School, had a trick up his sleeve to diffuse the tension.
“About 25 minutes into Netanyahu chewing it out, Ash says, ‘You know, Mr. Prime Minister, that’s all fine, but I want you to understand that at least my high school beat your high school in soccer the year that you were a senior,’” Rosenbach recalled.
Netanyahu burst out laughing. “‘Are you kidding me? You went to that high school?’” Rosenbach recalled Netanyahu asking Carter.
“It was one of these times when it was very high pressure — it was Ash doing something important for the president,” Rosenbach said. But Carter “delivered a human touch that kind of deflated the whole situation, too, so it’s one of my favorite memories of him.”
Carter championed several initiatives during the Obama years to improve the safety of military personnel. The redesign of military vehicles in order to be more blast resistant reduced the number of troops wounded or killed by mines, and was one of Carter’s accomplishments in which he took the most pride, according to Rosenbach.
Carter also pushed for the development of ballistic underwear in order to protect troops from suffering traumatic injuries.
“He also took that mission of protecting troops very seriously,” Rosenbach said.
After Carter was promoted to the top job in the Department of Defense, he opened combat roles in the military to women and ended a ban on transgender service members.
“Our mission is to defend this country, and we don’t want barriers unrelated to a person’s qualification to serve preventing us from recruiting or retaining the soldier, sailor, airman, or Marine who can best accomplish the mission,” Carter said in a June 2016 speech announcing the end of the ban.
Grace Y. Park, a current HKS student who identifies as female and non-binary, said they joined the military at a time when “it was just sort of a given that female service members didn’t serve in combat and transgender service members didn’t serve at all.”
“Just by changing those policies, the culture and the language around how we talked about these types of vulnerable communities in the military just totally shifted,” Park said of the changes Carter made during his time in the Defense Department. “He was able to do that in a really short amount of time.”
After the end of the Obama administration in 2017, Carter made a familiar move: to Cambridge, where he returned to the Kennedy School, this time to serve as director of the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
In an Oct. 25 statement to the Kennedy School announcing Carter’s death, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf emphasized Carter’s love for teaching and mentoring students.
“He said that one key reason he returned here was his experience at the Defense Department of visiting abroad and being greeted with the salutation ‘Hello Professor Carter’ from his former students—so he wanted to come back and work with more students, and he helped to raise funds for student fellowships,” Elmendorf wrote.
Allison said Carter was an “extraordinary person” whose death has left a big hole in the Kennedy School.
“People ask, ‘Well, who’s gonna replace Ash here?’ The answer is, nobody is going to replace Ash here,” Allison said. “There’s no such person who combines a strong footing in science and technology, and ferocious appetite for trying to understand all the frontiers of technology, and who has that deepest set of commitments to national security, policy, and policymaking.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of legal experts discussed lessons the psychedelics industry can learn from the history of U.S. cannabis policy during a virtual event hosted by Harvard Law School’s Petrie-Flom Center.
The panel, which discussed the implications of cannabis legalization in many states for the psychedelics industry, was moderated by Mason Marks, a Florida State University College of Law professor and a senior fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center. The event also featured law firm partners Hadas Alterman, Ariel Clark, and Vincent Sliwoski, as well as Vanderbilt Law School professor Robert Mikos.
Alterman said many private industries need to prepare for the potential decriminalization of psychedelic drugs, noting that the United States would require many more therapists and psychotherapists in the event more psychedelic drugs are legalized.
“That’s an entire universe of legal needs, corporate practice of medicine considerations, interactions with state agencies, federal agencies,” she said.
Clark said the regulation of cannabis in some states has rendered the drug unaffordable. He said the psychedelics industry should “create relationships” with the health care industry and other businesses to avoid the “same sort of bad outcomes that we see with cannabis.”
“We need to incorporate religious and community use, we need to have very minimal regulation and taxation. The cost of these medicines — it needs to be truly accessible,” she said. Otherwise, “psychedelics will look just like what we see in the pharmaceutical industry and in this country where health care and medicine is really just affordable for some.”
Alterman added that the regulation of the psychedelics industry needs to be socially equitable.
“At the most basic level, we need consistent, safe, high-quality care across the board. We need certified practitioners who are operating at or above a uniform standard of care, who have been trained rigorously to do this work,” she said. “That will be a balancing act between protecting consumers and not over regulating.”
Additionally, Clark suggested that regulations for psychedelics should also encompass religious and recreational uses of the drugs, rather than simply medical applications.
“We need to have all of these different points and paradigms of access and meet people where they are,” Clark said. “And it needs to be broadly inclusive and cannot just favor sort of a medicalized, therapeutic approach — that’s not culturally thoughtful.”
Carmel D. Shachar, executive director of the Petrie-Flom Center, said in an interview the event was held in light of a Colorado ballot measure, Proposition 122, which asked voters to weigh in on the decriminalization and regulation of certain psychedelics.
“I hope that what people will take from this event — regardless of where they personally stand on the legalization of psychedelics — is that it is really complicated to move, regulating these [substances] from the criminal system into legalization,” Shachar said.

An autopsy on the body of Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla, a transgender Harvard Kennedy School student from Peru who died in police custody in Indonesia earlier this year, yielded inconclusive findings in September, leaving unanswered questions about the circumstances surrounding his death.
The post-mortem examination of Ventocilla’s body could not determine how he died due to the condition of his body, which was embalmed, according to a Sept. 28 autopsy certificate from the Peruvian Public Ministry obtained by The Crimson. The autopsy was performed on Sept. 4 in Peru at the direction of prosecutors who are investigating his death.
Ventocilla died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Denpasar, five days after he was arrested upon arrival at the airport in Bali for possession of an herb grinder and other items suspected to contain marijuana. Ventocilla, a prominent trans rights activist, was traveling to Indonesia on a honeymoon with his spouse, Sebastián Marallano.
Ventocilla’s family alleges the arrest was motivated by racism and transphobia and that he was subjected to physical and psychological violence at the hands of Indonesian authorities. Police in Bali have denied allegations of wrongdoings, claiming Ventocilla died after consuming unseized drugs while in police custody.
Julio Arbizu González, a lawyer representing Ventocilla’s family, said in a statement the family had initially requested for an autopsy to be performed in Indonesia, before the body was returned to Peru.
“I believe that in the case of the Indonesian authorities it is more than a mistake, more than an error,” Arbizu said in Spanish. “We believe that what the Indonesian authorities actually did was deliver a body that was going to be difficult to undergo a legal autopsy. Knowing that the person had not died a natural death, which meant that obviously an investigation should be opened regarding the real causes of death — that obviously arouses suspicion of a cover-up.”
Stefanus Satake Bayu Setianto, head of public relations for the Bali Police, wrote in a statement in Indonesian that “the handling of the case against Peruvian citizens is in accordance with the SOP [standard operating procedure] carried out by investigators.”
“The cause of death has been issued by the hospital through a death certificate,” Bayu Setianto said. “The hospital is an institution outside the police and the statements issued are in accordance with their expertise.”
Arbizu also placed blame on Peruvian authorities for not doing more to ensure an autopsy was performed in Indonesia.
“It is well known that working on a body with formalin is much more difficult for specialists in legal medicine, doctors who must complete an autopsy protocol,” Arbizu said.
In the weeks following Ventocilla’s death, his family took aim at Peruvian consular services in Indonesia for not doing more to support him and Marallano while they were hospitalized in police custody. The Peruvian foreign ministry initially rejected the family’s allegations of wrongdoing — before changing its tune in a statement two days later that called for an investigation into Ventocilla’s death.
The Peruvian foreign ministry and the Peruvian prosecutor’s office did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Peruvian prosecutors are still probing Ventocilla’s death, following the Minnesota Protocol for the investigation of potentially lawful death. The timeline of the inquiry is unclear.

A victim of Jeffrey E. Epstein who claimed she was sexually abused by Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz settled on Tuesday a lawsuit she had filed against him, saying she “may have made a mistake” in accusing the prominent lawyer of wrongdoing.
The woman, Virginia L. Giuffre, sued Dershowitz for defamation in 2019 after he denied her claims that she was trafficked and forced to have sex with him between 2000 and 2002. Her former attorney, David Boies, also sued the longtime HLS professor for defamation.
Dershowitz subsequently filed counter defamation lawsuits against both Giuffre and Boies.
The three parties announced a non-monetary settlement on Tuesday and filed papers asking the federal judge in the case to dismiss their claims.
“I long believed that I was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein to Alan Dershowitz,” Giuffre said in a joint statement released on Tuesday. “However, I was very young at the time, it was a very stressful and traumatic environment, and Mr. Dershowitz has from the beginning consistently denied these allegations. I now recognize I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz.”
Dershowitz has long denied having a sexual relationship with Giuffre. In an interview Thursday, he said “there wasn’t a word of truth” to her accusations.
“I have never touched, flirted with, had sex with another woman other than my wife during the entire relevant time period, so this was a black and white case, not a case of gray,” Dershowitz said. “I don’t know who she is. Never met her in my life. And she finally recognized that she may very well have confused me with someone else.”
“I now feel totally vindicated,” he said. “I think that the people who canceled me as the result of this accusation should now apologize.”
Giuffre has accused several prominent men, including Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, of the British royal family, of sexually abusing her after she was trafficked by Epstein.
Boies, who filed a defamation suit against Dershowitz in 2019, said in the joint statement that “the time has come to end this litigation and move on.”
“I know that Alan Dershowitz has suffered greatly from the allegation of sexual abuse made against him—an allegation that he has consistently, and vehemently, denied,” Boies said in the statement. “I also know that this litigation has imposed, and continues to impose, a significant burden on Ms. Giuffre.”
Dershowitz was a longtime friend of Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. In 2008, Dershowitz represented Epstein in federal court, brokering a plea deal after Epstein first faced arrest for sex trafficking.
Epstein donated around $9.1 million to Harvard between 1998 and 2008, according to a review Harvard released in 2020. His largest gift, totaling $6.5 million, established the University’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics in 2003. Though he continued donating to the school following his 2006 arrest for solicitation of prostitution, Harvard did not accept any funds from Epstein after his conviction in 2008.
Epstein also served as a visiting fellow in Harvard’s Psychology Department during the 2005-2006 academic year. In 2020, University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced the school would divide the remaining $200,937 from Epstein’s donations between two non-profits supporting victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.

Shuttered for much of the pandemic, Harvard’s House grilles — once staples of student life — are slowly making a comeback.
Since the start of the fall semester, Quincy Grille, Dunster Grille, and Quad Grille have all started taking orders again. Student grille managers — the force behind their return — are responsible for creating new menus, setting prices, hiring staff, and marketing to underclassmen without knowledge of the eateries’ pre-pandemic significance.
House grilles are entirely student-run, leaving much of their operations and finances to the discretion of student managers. The Crimson interviewed student managers at the three reopened grilles about the logistics of their work and challenges ahead.
Each of Quincy Grille’s three student managers receives 20 percent of the grille’s net profits, calculated after the University allocates roughly 4 percent fee to cover expenses, according to manager Max C. Serrano-Wu ’22-’23. The remaining percentage of profit is paid to house administrators, he added.
Managers and staff at the Quad Grille all receive an hourly wage and no additional share of the profit or tips, according to grille manager Jane Y. Rhee ’23.
Dunster Grille allocates any end-of-year profits to a savings account for “new equipment, equipment repair, and general grille upgrades,” per student manager Jacob R. Jimenez ’23-’24.
“There was a lot of revenue at the very end of [last] semester, when everyone was trying to blow all their BoardPlus at grilles,” Jimenez said. “So we did make a profit last year, but all of that money goes into a grille savings account that we use for repairs — for example, if the cooler breaks.”
Jimenez added that Dunster Grille does not have a large profit margin.
“To my knowledge, all the student grilles don’t run at super profitable rates,” he added. “There’s a lot of startup costs — so, starting the grille every year — because you have to pay for the Crimson Cash machine.”
Grille managers said the grilles faced challenges in reopening on a campus where only one College class was here to see the business run before Covid-19.
Serrano-Wu said the pandemic resulted in a loss of “historical knowledge” among both the Quincy Grille employees and the customers.
“The main problem in terms of getting staff is that people haven’t done this job before,” Quincy Grille manager Gabriel E. Lopez-Garrido ’23 said.
Jimenez, the sole student manager at Dunster Grille, said the restaurant’s reopening earlier this year benefited from the wisdom of a manager who had worked in the grille before the pandemic.
“Dunster was lucky to have a manager who served before Covid still there after Covid to get things back rolling,” Jimenez said. “But we’re still seeing some of the aftershocks of Covid.”
Grilles located at Winthrop House and Eliot House have remained shuttered so far.
Serrano-Wu said many freshmen, sophomores, and juniors do not even know about the grilles.
“We’ve been trying to get a lot of people to come here for the grille, learn about BoardPlus,” Serrano-Wu said.
“It’s honestly a shame because, obviously, it’s a student-run grill, so the purpose of the grille is just to reach out to as many students as possible,” Lopez-Garrido said.

BOSTON — Several prominent members of the Boston Celtics discussed their philanthropy and offered a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the sports-business industry at a Thursday event organized by the Harvard Undergraduate Sports Lab.
The event included a panel titled “Business off the Court: The Harvard Breakdown on Sports Business,” featuring Celtics forward Grant D. Williams, Vice President of Player Development Allison S. Feaster ’98, Celtics President Richard E. Gotham, team part-owner Glenn H. Hutchins ’77, and NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark A. Tatum.
Harvard Business School Professor Anita Elberse moderated the panel, which took place in Boston at the team’s practice facility.
Prior to the moderated panel, attendees also heard remarks from Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad K. Stevens, Vice President of Basketball Operations Mike Zarren, and the team’s primary owners Wycliffe K. “Wyc” Grousbeck and Stephen G. Pagliuca.
Hutchins, who donated a total of $25 million to the University to fund the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, said his philanthropy aims to create social change by targeting issues of race and poverty in the United States.
“When I was a Harvard student, I had to work a couple jobs,” he said. “I promised myself that if I did make some money in life, I would try to give back.”
Hutchins, who also serves on the board of the Obama Foundation, said philanthropists should dedicate themselves to investing in the creation of “persistent institutions” that can address long-term, structural problems such as racial inequality.
“Find something you can invest in that’s persistent, rather than just giving money to it today because it’s the issue of the moment,” he said.
Williams, who is in his fourth year with the Celtics and was a key part of the team’s run to the NBA Finals last year, also said he tries his “best to give back as much as I was given to growing up.”
“Especially in our communities, we have to do our best to listen and hear what they need and what we can provide,” he said.
According to Feaster, the team’s philanthropic work centers around “criminal justice and law enforcement, equity in education, equity in healthcare.”
“We’re super passionate about the work that we do from a community standpoint,” she said.
Gotham also addressed the nature of the sports industry, which he described as “challenging” from a business perspective due to its inherent uncertainty.
“It’s just so different than everything else, and it all stems from the fact that — what happens when Grant and his teammates go out on the court every night — you just don’t know what’s going to happen,” he said.
Despite these challenges, Stevens advised students to seek out experience in the sports industry, leveraging their Harvard network, in his remarks prior to the panel.
“Expand your network,” Stevens said. “The Harvard thing probably doesn’t hurt either.”

New York Times journalist Jodi Kantor — one of the reporters who broke the story of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein — and actress Ashley Judd — one of the first women to publicly speak out against the Hollywood mogul — talked about the making of the ground-breaking article and the #MeToo movement at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Thursday evening.
Iris Bohnet, co-director of the Harvard Kennedy School’s Women and Public Policy Program, moderated the event. Kantor, along with co-writer Megan Twohey, exposed Weinstein’s decades of sexual misconduct in an October 2017 investigative article, which earned the reporters a 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Twohey was also scheduled to join the panel, but could not make it.
Kantor and Twohey’s investigation helped popularize the #MeToo movement, which was first launched by activist Tarana Burke in 2006 to empower women to share their experiences with sexual misconduct and call for accountability
Days after The New York Times published the piece exposing Weinstein, actress Alyssa Milano tweeted a viral message asking women who had also been sexually harassed or assaulted to comment “me too.” Judd said Milano’s message touched millions of people, including her own mother.
“That is what the movement has done,” Judd said. “It’s allowed us to have our autonomy and be in our narrative, and that’s where it starts.”
The panel opened with a screening of the trailer for the movie “She Said,” which is based on the 2019 book of the same name that details Kantor and Twohey’s reporting process. The film is slated for theatrical release on Nov. 18.
Kantor explained that it was difficult to find women who would agree to go on the record and attach their names to their stories of sexual harassment and abuse.
Several women the reporters met had signed non-disclosure agreements, which prevented them from speaking out for fear of legal consequences. Kantor added that the uncertainty surrounding the article’s repercussions deterred some women from coming forward.
“Even you, Ashley, had serious deliberations about whether this was a safe thing to do because none of us knew at the time whether it ultimately was,” Kantor said to Judd.
“[Megan’s] and my goal was to do the investigative work to give the women a platform to stand on,” she added.
Both Judd and Kantor recalled that they had imagined the article would at best spark a protest outside of Weinstein’s apartment or inspire a joke at the Oscars. Kantor said she is “still flabbergasted” at the impact the story has had on Hollywood and beyond.
“Journalism was sort of the form of last resort because every other system had failed: HR, the law, the Weinstein Company board of directors,” Kantor said. “So it was left to these two mom journalists.”
In a Q&A session after the panel, Judd described some of the recent changes she has noticed both globally and within Hollywood in response to the #MeToo movement.
“I’ve been sexually harassed on set more times than I can count, and I never knew where to go or who to tell,” she said. “Now on my union card — proud union member — there is a sexual harassment hotline to call.”

In its final competition of the fall season, Harvard’s women’s tennis team faced off against Boston College and Boston University at home for the Harvard Invitational. Throughout the short fall season, the Crimson saw action at the ITA Super Regionals, Brown Quad Invite, and Harvard Fall Classic, with overall positive results. The Harvard Invitational gave players a chance to compete in a dual-match format, the predominant format for the spring season.
“As a team we’ve definitely been building a lot and this was our last tournament of the fall season, so it was really exciting to be able to showcase all the hard work we’ve been doing,” said sophomore Angel You, who competed in both singles and doubles over the weekend.
Harvard had an impressive showing in singles, finishing out the weekend with a 13-4 record after a series of exciting matches. On the first day of competition, the Crimson took all but one of its singles matches against Boston College. First-year top-seed Charlotte Owensby came back after dropping her first set to defeat Marice Aguiar, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6(4). Junior Iveta Daujotaite earned a hard-fought victory in two tiebreaks over Seren Agar, 7-6(4), 7-6(4).
“As a team we’ve been working on strategies and fine-tuning these skills, and I think that having the ability to really translate those skills has been really interesting,” You shared.
On the second and third days of the tournament, Harvard faced BU, with mixed outcomes. It was strong in singles performance again, winning six of eight matches. Senior Sophia Ho won an exciting match against the Terriers’ Kaitlin Tan, 6-0, 2-6, 10-6. You defeated Sydney Sharma in a ten-point tiebreaker, 6-2, 5-7, 10-5 before falling to Navya Vadlamudi in a nail-biter, 1-6, 6-2, 10-6.
“My strategy, when it really comes down to the wire, is definitely just to breathe and play my game, remember what we’re working on in training, focus on the basics, and just stay in and play tough,” You explained. “Especially when a lot is on the line, it’s important to just breathe and focus.”
Doubles matches proved to be a toss-up. On Court 3, Owensby and sophomore Holly Fischer fought hard but ultimately fell to Seren Agar and Natalie Eordekian in a tiebreak, 7-6(6). Meanwhile, sophomores Maxi Duncan and Rachel Arbitman had a tough match against the Eagles’ Aguiar and Sophia Edwards, who were able to get the break to win 6-4. The pairing of You and Daujotaite defeated BC’s Hailey Wilcox and Muskan Mahajan on the first day of competition, 6-4, which was the Crimson’s only doubles win against the Eagles. The pair then triumphed over BU’s Sydney Sharma and Steph Nguyen, 6-2, the next day. Junior Sany Gawande partnered with You on the final day of competition to continue the win streak, defeating Vadlamudi and Victoria Carlsten, 7-5.
“I think one of the strengths that [Daujotaite] and [Gawande] and I have is that we play very aggressive doubles,” said You, who was also undefeated in doubles play at the Brown Quad Invite on Oct. 29-31. “It’s a lot of coming in, taking volleys, having a big serve to set up your partner to finish the point at net.”
With the fall season coming to a close, Harvard will shift its focus towards preparing for the spring, which marks a change in match format. In lieu of individual competition, the spring season will feature team-based dual matches.
“Being at home and to just have your family and friends come to watch you play, and also being able to compete next to your teammates is just an unbelievable experience,” You said. “This weekend it was a dual match, so it’s really just giving us a feeling of what the spring is going to feel like.”
Harvard finished the 2021-22 spring season ranked No. 73 with a 3-4 record in Ivy League competition. However, its hopes are higher for the spring after improving doubles performance and bringing Owensby into the fold. The new-look Crimson will restart team matches in early 2023.

Goodbye 70-degree days (mostly) — fall has arrived in full force and, so it’s (finally?) time to spend our days trekking over a warm-colored mosaic of leaves and wondering when we’ll next slip on a pile of them. In case your impromptu slip-and-slide pushes you into a horde of tourists, Flyby’s got you covered with this bingo card to turn even the most awkward encounters into a win.
