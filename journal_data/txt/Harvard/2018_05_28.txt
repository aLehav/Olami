After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Starting off Saturday at Boston Calling with Leikeli47 was an excellent choice. The New York hip-hop artist wore a mask, as she always does, this one a large bandana with holes for her eyes and mouth. Accompanied by a DJ and three female backup dancers (and, at one point, an incredible male dancer in stunning long, black opera gloves), Leikeli47 won her early afternoon crowd over with her infectious positivity and uplifting banter. Her songs are short—only a few pass the three-minute mark, and not by much—and feature energetically repetitive lyrics, making them very friendly for newcomers to her music. Take, for instance, “Look,” a track off of “Wash & Set,” her most recent album. The chorus is solely comprised of the lyrics “It’s a look / Don’t you see it? / ‘Cause, baby, it’s a look,” and variations thereof. During the course of the song, Leikeli47 pointed out members of the audience in various types of whimsical garb, and told them “That’s a look!” The general joy and dance-ready beats continued unabated even as she told the crowd about a recent heartbreak. Leikeli47’s unapologetic fierceness ensured that even those who had never heard of her before Boston Calling will find it hard to forget her.
At 2:30 p.m., Natalie Portman ‘03 took to the Arena Stage to share a curated series of short, silent films directed by women. Each film was accompanied with music by St. Vincent and Leikeli47 or narration from the Academy Award-winning actress herself. The first film, “Verdict: Not Guilty,” written, produced, and co-directed by Eloyce and James Gist, followed the Devil’s attempts to prosecute a Christian woman who died after giving birth to a child out wedlock. St. Vincent scored the shakily-shot, 1933 silent film with a jagged, synth-heavy original composition. Afterwards, Natalie Portman returned to the stage to narrate another Gist film, “Hell-Bound Train.” Her spoken-word style accompaniment delighted some, but may have confused others, judging by the wave of audience members that filtered out of the arena while Portman’s back was turned. To close the film screenings, Leikeli47 took to the stage to score several films, including critically-acclaimed writer Zora Neale Hurston’s “Fieldwork,” with “Attitude” and other songs from “Wash & Set.”
Mount Kimbie, an electronic music duo from the U.K., brought a very different vibe to Boston Calling’s Delta Blue Stage after Leikeli47’s performance. Their hazy, dream-like post-dubstep sound made for a relaxing 50 minutes. Those familiar with their work may wonder how songs like “Blue Train Lines” were performed live, without frequent collaborator King Krule to contribute vocals. The pair were joined onstage by a female singer and another musician, but despite this addition, the vocals remained largely in the background. The first several songs they played were entirely instrumental, and even when lyrics were introduced, the focus remained on the distorted found sounds and gentle beats that make up their style. The effect of all this, live, was less conducive to dancing than to swaying in place, but in a three-day-long festival, gentleness has its place. Mount Kimbie seemed to recognize that, and spoke very little during their set. Instead, they let their music speak for them. Even though the artists Mount Kimbie work with couldn’t be there, the duo still put on a show that demonstrated that not all music needs to be the energetic, dance-ready fare commonly found at festivals.
Clichéed as it may be, the best way to describe Manchester Orchestra’s performance at Boston Calling is full of heart. Andy Hull, the singer-songwriter frontman of the Atlanta indie rock band was so invested in the music that he was sweating through his shirt and his beard by the end of the show. And Manchester Orchestra’s music deserves it—although aurally not wildly different from their contemporaries in the indie rock world, the spirit with which they played made their performance memorable. One of the highlights of the show was “The Gold,” one of the hits from “A Black Mile to the Surface,” released last year. The chorus is a capella, and its drawn out words make for the perfect concert moment: The entire audience singing in unison, “I believed you were crazy / You believed that you loved me.” Live music has an ineffable quality, some alchemy of massive crowds and sheer vicinity to the performers, that can distill into instances of unity. But it only works if the band can lend their raw emotionality to the audience. Hull and the rest of Manchester Orchestra certainly had that in spades, and their performance was passionate enough to bring both diehard fans and newcomers with them.

The crowd that gathered in anticipation of Tyler, The Creator’s set at Boston Calling on Saturday wasn’t just unique in that it filled every inch of space from the front of the festival’s Delta Blue Stage to the back, but also in that the average age of the audience was noticeably younger than that of most of the festival’s other crowds. This is not to say that people of certain generations cannot enjoy Tyler, The Creator, but rather that a discernible divide occured between audiences heading to rock band Queens of the Stone Age and the popular hip-hop artist from California. Other than for the obvious reason (only one member of Queens of the Stone Age is under the age of 40 while Tyler, The Creator just turned 27) there is something about Tyler and the loneliness he so often exudes that resonates with young adulthood. It’s a reminder that the very floor he and all the weekend’s artists did and will perform on is on the grounds of a college where many a student has felt the same.
On first sight of Tyler, The Creator, who sported a custom high-visibility traffic jacket and matching shorts over a white t-shirt, the crowd moved forward at least ten feet towards the stage. Water bottles flew through the air, spraying droplets over the mass of jumping, dancing bodies that moved and sang in unison to the opening number “Where This Flower Blooms.” A cosmic-colored silhouette of a starry forest shimmered on stage behind Tyler, recounting the uncertainty of his childhood juxtaposed with his life now. His body shifted back and forth with each beat of the lines “I rock / I roll / I bloom / I glow” before rising to signal the end of the song.
The theme of loneliness played out in songs like “Ziploc” and the aptly named “Mr. Lonely.” In the former, a powerful and difficult-to-perform piece featuring the lines “What’s the point of bein’ rich when you wake up alone? / What’s the point of goin’ home when it ain’t nobody there?,” Tyler rapped about his deeply felt loneliness as well as his frustration at his music not getting enough radio play. At the end, breathless, he exclaimed “N----, that song hard as fuck to perform,” to resounding cheers. His honesty is just another part of his charm. When the upbeat “911”  faded into “Mr. Lonely,” so did the mood of his crowd. The chants of “I can’t even lie, I’ve been lonely as fuck” growing louder and freer with each repeat until the shared expression of forlornness melted the feeling away.
Tyler, The Creator possesses a unique talent to be able to make every member of an audience feel exactly how he wants them to and change that feeling rapidly. By the time he got to “48” from his 2013 album “Wolf,” every hand was in the air. As his set came to a close he, like every person whose eyes were still glued to his every movement, wanted more time. “Do I have ten more minutes?” he shouted offstage. “Ten more? Two more songs and I’m out.” Someone must’ve approved, but over the sound of screaming it was impossible to tell who or what they said. He quieted the audience, asked them to put their phones away and put whatever energy they had left into going crazy for his last two songs. He performed, “I Ain’t Got Time!” to a chorus of jumping feet, the crowd now a full on mosh pit.
Just as the energy hit its peak, Tyler drew it in for one, final number. A chorus rose from the mass of tired bodies overwhelmed with emotion—some to the point of tears—to join him in singing “See You Again.” “Can I get a kiss? / And can you make it last forever? / I said I’m ‘bout to go to war / And I don’t know if I’ma see you again,” the crowd and their beloved Creator sang together, finding hope in their shared loneliness before parting for the night.

At the end of a day full of heavyweights from every branch of rock, such as St. Vincent, Queens of the Stone Age, and Manchester Orchestra, it was fitting that the closing act of the second day of Boston Calling was a king of the genre: Jack White. Having produced over a dozen albums as a part of three bands and as a solo act, White has embodied many aspects of rock’n’roll, from its blues and rockabilly roots to the garage-rock revival of the 2000s. All these tendencies were on display tonight as White and his band played songs careening wildly across his career, rarely pausing between songs. The effect of this temporal wandering was to demonstrate White’s range while also emphasizing the stripped-down, energetic core of his music.
White opened with “Over and Over and Over,” one of the more popular tracks off of “Boarding House Reach,” his latest album, only to play “Wasting My Time” just two songs later. This last tune is off The White Stripes’ very first, eponymous album, released in 1999. In the first ten minutes of the concert, White had bridged two decades of his music seamlessly. Indeed, White proceeded to play songs from every band of which he’s been involved, but with a clear bias towards The White Stripes and his solo career, and away from his from work with The Dead Weather and The Raconteurs.
Perhaps the best way to think about White’s performance, however, is less as a set of songs and more as a nearly two-hour-long stream of almost unbroken guitar riffs and drum beats. White’s vocals were, as always, frenetic and distorted from singing too close to the mic. Between that and the clear focus on the guitar’s mixing, it was hard to make out many of the lyrics, further adding to the blending effects of White’s signature style.
A few of White’s songs did stand out from the mix, however: “Hotel Yorba,” another from his White Stripes days, was notable for its acoustic, classic sound, heavily tinged with bluegrass and rockabilly, a welcome break from the harder, heavier, and more distorted sounds of White’s later work. Others included the title tracks from his solo albums “Blunderbuss” and “Lazaretto,” the latter being an electrified, punky, funky tune in line with his recent sensibilities.
Despite White’s long and successful career after they broke up, The White Stripes are still responsible for many of White’s biggest hits, and he clearly recognized this. He ended the first part of his show on “The Hardest Button to Button,” off of their 2003 album “Elephant.” Meg White’s simple, bass-drum-heavy beat (played by his current drummer, Carla Azar) provided a foundation for him to climb up and down the scale on his guitar. After finishing shredding, the band left the stage to be replaced by photos of themselves, one at a time, on the massive screens surrounding the stage.
The biggest song of the night was yet to come, however, and its arrival was presaged by the crowd, who, while waiting for White’s return, chanted the iconic melody of “Seven Nation Army.” When he and his band inevitably took the stage once more, it was clear what song would close out the night.
Before that, however, was an extended, roughly ten-song encore. The encore was overtly political at times. At one point, Donald Trump’s face popped up on screen, only to be used as a dartboard by Azar in video form.
This was far from the only animation, however: A geometric dog running along an empty road accompanied the song “Why Walk a Dog?,” and architectural imagery (a tunnel with neon lightning bolts, an arched hallway, a stained-glass window) was commonplace. Scattered throughout were the three vertical white lines that function as a quasi-logo for White. Always a stickler for color, White traded the iconic red-and-white palette of The White Stripes for cooler tones. Blue lights flooded the stage, and many of the background animations and videos had a blue or grayscale color scheme.
Eventually, White could put off the end no longer—although he resisted it. “I don’t wanna go,” he told the audience at one point. “I don’t wanna go but they’re making me go.” Indeed, he did play longer than the time allotted him on the schedule by at least ten minutes. Despite this, White kept the energy up to the very end—towards the end of the encore, he was so frenetic in his movements that he knocked over one of Azar’s cymbals by accident. Certainly, when it came time to play “Seven Nation Army,” both he and the audience were at the peak of excitement, only to go their separate ways just a few minutes later. White closed out his show with a plea for his audience to “Spread positivity, not hate.”
White is certainly a virtuoso, a multi-instrumentalist who felt as comfortable hopping on the piano for a few songs as he did shredding on his guitar. He put on an incredible show, full of his signature vitality and skill. At the same time, however, his set provided a thought-provoking reminder of the risks of early fame. White’s star has far from faded, and he continues to put out new and exciting music, but at the end of the day, nothing he played could get his audience as excited as a 15-year-old song. Still, White continues to exemplify some of the best that rock has to offer, and his placement as a headliner of Boston Calling was well-earned.

Boston’s own STL GLD opened the last day of Boston Calling with a rousing hip-hop set on the Red Stage. The group, comprised of Roxbury native Moe Pope and New York to Western Mass. transplant The Arcitype, kept the energy up and the music going all in spite of the 50 degree weather. Pope dazzled in numbers like “Torch Song,” in which he rapped, “If we don’t love us, then we’re lost / If we don’t own land, it’s not ours / I’m here to spread love for all kinds, who don’t want us putting truth in young minds.” At one point the group rapped over a supercut of Muhammad Ali footage on the screen behind them. The group gave a nod to fellow hip hop duo Run the Jewels—an obvious inspiration for their style—and sampled House of Pain’s “Jump Around” before performing their latest release “Donut Shop” to close the set. By the end of their 30 minutes, STL GLD managed to amass one of the largest afternoon crowds of the weekend.
Keeping with the New England theme, Portland, Maine’s Weakened Friends brought their indie rock meets pop-punk sound to the music festival’s Green Stage. The self-described “indie noise junk band” could be heard across the main festival ground thanks to lead singer Sonia Sturino’s delightfully wailing and wavering voice. The band played “Crshd” from their 2016 album “Crushed” early in the set, letting loose as they transitioned to earlier album “Gloomy Tunes” with the songs “Main Bitch” and “Miserable.” Bassist Annie Hoffman and Sturino on guitar played off one another well, especially over the solid drumming of Cam Jones. They weren’t much for banter, save a standard greeting, introduction, and a bit of self-deprecation. “If you don’t like it thanks for tolerating it, I’m sorry,” Sturino said to the crowd towards the end of their set. The resounding cheers implied the audience didn’t just tolerate, but thoroughly enjoyed what Weakened Friends had to offer.
A far cry from the early afternoon rock and hip-hop sets at the Red and Green Stages, synth-pop artist Zola Jesus took to the Delta Blue Stage donning a costume of red mesh fabric over a black tunic to perform a haunting, gothic set. While the chilly wind and her eccentric dance moves blew her hair and costume into her face—“I’m doing this blind up here,” she exclaimed—her raw, ethereal vocals emerged whole from the mess of fabric and hair. On a constant crescendo, Zola Jesus at one point wrapped herself in a black and white blanket(the lights, costumes, and backdrops for the set all followed a red, black, and white theme)and began stomping and dancing contortion-style around the stage. The artist played the synths herself, accompanied by violin and guitar to create the ominous instrumentation that characterizes her music. This mood was emphasized by the sinister lyrics of tracks like “Exhumed,” in which she sang, “Bury the tongue between the teeth / Open the jaw and sink in deep / Force it open and claw the grip / Down throat, you let it slip, slip, slip, slip, slip.” Repetitive choruses like that of the song “Bound,” which is just the words “But two is not enough,” gave Zola Jesus the opportunity to showcase her vocal abilities. She alternately riffed on and held sustained high notes for her modest but captivated crowd, provoking cheers of approval. She ended her melancholy set screeching, throwing herself around the stage as her band members sunk to the floor beside her.
As the rain picked up, the indie-rock band Dirty Projectors overcame technical difficulties to put on a folksy show on the Delta Blue Stage. Longstreth likened dealing with the issues—equipment issues, a delayed start time, and a bum bass—to swinging a baseball bat underwater. “It’s like resistance training,” he said. “It feels good.” They opened with “Dance For You,” a track well-suited to frontman David Longstreth’s rustic voice. The six member band’s style is guitar-focused, but by no means guitar-heavy. The piano, keyboard, bass, and drums all blended well with the band’s two guitarists. They conferred before starting each song, eventually settling into an easy rhythm with one another. By the time the band jumped into “Break-thru” the crowd couldn’t help but dance along—and not because of the cold. The tune’s upbeat chorus, “Under the sun, there's nothing new / But she keeps it 100 in the shade / She's a break-thru,” called for dancing. Band members Felicia Douglass, Maia Friedman, and Kristin Slipp took the lead on the song “Beautiful Mother,” while Longstreth sunk to the ground so as not to steal attention from the women singing in beautiful harmony. For all the technical obstacles that slowed them down at the start, Dirty Projectors pulled through and played a wonderful show.

As the light faded and the rain came down on the crowd at Boston Calling’s Delta Blue Stage, Fleet Foxes brought a bit of natural beauty to Allston. Aided only by simple yet vibrant animations, the Seattle indie folk band charmed and moved their audience with their acoustic sound and sweet harmonies. Focusing mostly on older songs, their set encouraged singing along, with many near-a capella moments throughout. Lead singer and guitarist Robin Pecknold led the band on a tour of their lyrically dense oeuvre, every song a vocalist’s dream.
Almost immediately upon coming onstage, Fleet Foxes launched into “Grown Ocean,” a rollicking song in which Pecknold dreams of an ideal relationship that breaks into a yearning bridge, begging not to be woken up. Pulled from their second album “Helplessness Blues,” the track features the poetic lyricism and unconventional song structure typical of Fleet Foxes. For instance, the lines from which the song draws its title, “Children grown on the edge of the ocean / Kept like jewelry, kept with devotion,” discuss Pecknold’s vision of fatherhood. They also contain one of the band’s many references to the natural world, which all add to their already bucolic aesthetic.
After “Grown Ocean,” Fleet Foxes played a mix of songs from “Helplessness Blues” and their eponymous debut. Of these, one song received an especially enthusiastic response from the audience: “White Winter Hymnal,” a violent fairytale that offsets its grim content with beautiful imagery of bloody snow resembling summertime strawberries. Another fan-favorite was “Mykonos,” which tells of someone trying to help a friend, only to be rebuffed. Its slides back and forth between simple and complex from verse to verse. One standout example of this are the lines “The door slammed loud and rose up a cloud of dust on us / Footsteps follow down through the hollow sound, torn up,” which describe the aftermath of an argument with unexpected perfection.
Beginning with “Mykonos,” Fleet Foxes explored some of their earliest and latest work, playing songs from their second EP, “Sun Giant,” released in 2008, as well as “Crack Up,” an album that dropped last year. They played two songs back-to-back off of the latter, namely “Third of May / Ōdaigahara” and “If You Need to, Keep Time on Me,” before going back to “Sun Giant” for “Drops In The River.” To close out the show, they did an inspiring rendition of the title track of “Helplessness Blues,” a reflection on growing up and finding one’s path that remains just as relevant, if not more so, than it was when it was released in 2011.
At this point the band left the stage, and the show seemed to be over with time left on the clock. No other non-headliner I had seen at Boston Calling did an encore—in an hour-long set, the few minutes they inevitably take is far too much. This is especially true when, as with Fleet Foxes, many songs approach or break the five-minute mark. Doing so may have caused some confusion or even annoyance in some members of the audience. But Pecknold made sure the encore was worth it.
Pecknold came back alone, armed only with a guitar, and thanked the crowd again (as he had periodically throughout the evening). Without further ado, he strummed the opening chords of “Oliver James.” As on the album, his performance was nearly a capella, except for some picking and slapping on his guitar, showcasing his clear and powerful voice. Unlike the studio version, however, thousands of other voices joined Pecknold’s, and thousands of hands clapped with him. This was Fleet Foxes, stripped down to its core, and as Pecknold howled, “Oliver James, washed in the rain no longer,” the rain kept pattering down on all of us.
