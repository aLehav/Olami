After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I rarely complain about HUDS. In fact, I believe that there are a great many things that the dining halls here do well: the dining staff is friendly, and the food is flavorful. But lately, I’ve been troubled by a matter of paramount importance: milk.
The three main options for milk in the Harvard dining halls are chocolate, skim, and one percent. The d-hall dispensers offer no choice of whole milk, or even the closest alternative, two percent.
I thought at length about writing an opinion editorial on the lack of whole milk in our dining halls. I researched the health issues surrounding fat content in milk. Despite the long-held assumption that low-fat milk is healthier than the other options, recent (correlation-based) research has suggested that the opposite: A 2013 study carried out at the University of Virginia School of Medicine found that children who drank low-fat milk were heavier. I talked to friends about their milk preferences, leading to vigorous debates about the relative merits of each type of milk. These disagreements centered on the qualitative, not quantitative, distinctions, pitting the more flavorful and rich taste of whole milk against the higher utility of skim milk for breakfast cereal.
But I soon realized that I had spent too much time focused on a remarkably trivial issue (though some may disagree). I had pestered friends; I had read scientific papers; I had agonized over word choice and sentence structure—all for the sake of a beverage. Right now, the world is struggling with containing Ebola and countering ISIS. Harvard confronts shuttered health services and breaches of privacy. But me? I was focused on whole milk. It all seemed so pointless.
And in many ways, it was. My friends and I spent hours talking and complaining about the milk options in our dining and considered asking HUDS to change their ways, or starting a petition to gather signatures. But in the end, we did nothing. We backed up our bravado with a complete lack of action, even though we talked about whole milk with such vigor and defended and championed its merits so fiercely. And to top it all off, there is, in fact, whole milk in Harvard’s dining halls—just check the fridges.
But our debates about whole milk did matter, at least to us, at least for a time. In truth, we never really expected to take action—more than anything else, the discussion represented an escape. It was a way to concentrate our passions and energies on a topic outside our mundane daily routines of classes, clubs, sports, and work. Every day, we follow the same old patterns, treading the same paths from our houses to our classrooms to our dining halls to our gyms and back to our houses; every day, we talk about the same old topics, cycling through the same old greetings and discussions of classes and sports and politics and life.
But never before had we talked about milk.
And we probably will never talk about it again. We’ll remember that one time, though—that one intense debate about the taste and texture of a quotidian beverage. It was an experience far removed from our normal conversations, a breath of fresh air, an injection of much-needed silliness and frivolity, a welcome distraction from a physics problem set that had dragged late into the night.
Distractions are largely unwelcome in our daily lives. We too often load our lives with classes and activities. We aim to fill up every spare hour or minute of our calendars, and in so doing, we render ourselves unappreciative – even afraid – of breaks or downtime or the silly conversations that won’t lead to academic, extracurricular, or professional success.
And yet there is evidence—both scientific and anecdotal—that the best, most creative thinking often occurs in these moments of relaxation, in the shower or on a run or anywhere entirely removed from our normal, focused state of thinking. These moments are also often the most enjoyable, the most fun.
So let’s cherish them, these moments apart from the monotony and the rhythm and the constant drum of life, because they are the most valuable of all. Let’s indulge in silliness and in the people around us. Let’s all stop and drink some milk—and maybe even write an article about it.
Even if we forget fat content, we’ll certainly be healthier in spirit.

In recent years, a false sense of resolution has emerged around the narrative of the AIDS epidemic, especially in the United States. “False” because the epidemic did not end in the 1990s. It continues to ravage through our communities today as we see: More people transmitting the virus than being treated for it; annual cuts to America’s fiscal support for the fight against AIDS; and very little awareness among Americans of their HIV status that has led to a lack of control over their illness.
We, the Global Health & AIDS Coalition, claim that the domestic and global AIDS epidemic is currently in a state of emergency. There is an urgent need to accelerate efforts to ensure that all that has been accomplished in past few decades is not reversed.
Since 2010, Congress has cut over $700 million from America’s bilateral global AIDS contribution, with an additional $300 million currently on the chopping block.  A lack of political will and discourse has led to the neglect of important global funding mechanisms that are heavily reliant on American dollars, like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. While flatlining fiscal support has already shown to damage past and future progress in the fight against global AIDS, the funding cuts Congress has made cripple any attempts to scale up treatment programs in their struggle to outpace new infections.
Failing to overcome the tide of new infections will have very real consequences. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 35 million people are currently living with HIV globally. Despite this enormous disease burden, only 36 percent of HIV-positive people in low- and middle-income countries are on antiretroviral therapy. With such low access to these life-saving medicines, the virus claims almost 2 million lives each year. To date, the epidemic has claimed a total of 39 million lives.
We continue to see more transmission each year than treatment initiations. We refuse to let this trend continue, especially given the fact that antiretroviral therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of transmission by 96 percent.
Treatment is prevention. Last year, 2.1 million people were newly infected with the virus while only 1.6 million people were placed on treatment the year prior. Therefore, at current rates, half a million more people become infected every year than are initiated on treatment. To bring about an end to the AIDS epidemic, financial support for the fight against global AIDS must scale up and initiate millions more on lifesaving therapies.
And while the media describes HIV/AIDS most often as the plight of sub-Saharan Africa alone, the United States has failed to stamp out the epidemic within its own borders. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 1 million Americans are living with HIV and an additional 50,000 are newly infected each year.
A recent study estimated that 20 percent of Americans living with HIV are unaware of their status. In 2011, it was found that less than 30 percent of those with HIV have their illness under control and two-thirds of those who had been diagnosed were no longer receiving treatment. Fewer than half of america’s youth—those between the ages of 18 and 24—have been diagnosed.
These statistics are inexcusable in light of the reliable and affordable evidence-based tools that are available to treat HIV in America today. GHAC calls upon Congress to put HIV/AIDS on the forefront of their political agendas and demand increased funding for treatment and diagnostic efforts in the United States and globally.
Year after year, we hear empty promises from our political leaders as they claim to reignite their commitment to ending the AIDS epidemic. Obama’s presidential campaign provided us with nothing but lip service, meanwhile Hillary Clinton’s “Blueprint for an AIDS-free Generation” has been swept under the rug.
We are a part of a generation that has never known of a time in which HIV has not threatened our health, and we are dedicated to ensuring that our children and grandchildren do not face the same threat. We are incredibly close to having the AIDS epidemic under our control. We know what needs to be done; the solutions are simple. What we need is action: from our politicians and our community. We need everyone to reach out to their legislators and demand heightened attention to HIV/AIDS.
We need everyone to stay informed about this issue—an issue that continues to affect millions of people each day, and kill over a million each year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At this point, after scores of op-eds about legacy, most of us know how the argument goes.
Legacy preference in admissions serves as a “tie-breaker” between qualified candidates, favoring students who are the children of alumni. Such a preference goes against the University’s commitment to diversity on campus.  Therefore, we should abolish legacy.
The argument comes with numbers. As Reina Gattuso mentions in her recent column: “37 percent of current undergrads whose parent(s) went here come from households with incomes over $500,000 a year, at the national top one percent for household income.”
The argument also has estimates. One estimate found that, in the 2010-2011 school year, about 45 percent of Harvard students came from families that earn more than $200,000 a year. Only about four percent came from families in the bottom quintile of U.S. incomes. Legacies students tend to be more affluent. So getting rid of legacy may be a good first step to making up for this disparity.
And to top it off, the argument has research. Studies have shown that legacy preference has no statistically significant effect on alumni giving. Plus, schools that dropped legacy preference in recent years saw no significant effect on alumni donations.
But there’s a problem with this argument: it makes too much sense. Because it sticks to things like facts, it misses the most common and powerful counter-argument from legacy and non-legacy students alike. That counter-argument goes something like this: “It’s a nice thing to do.”
A lot of students are comforted knowing that their kids may have a boost when they apply to Harvard. And, as long as legacy remains merely a “tie-breaker” between qualified candidates, its downsides can’t be too bad, right? After all, Harvard is a private institution. It can “do nice things” for its alumni. So what’s the big deal in having a “tie-breaker”? Most of the legacy kids are surely qualified anyway. Thinking practically, it makes no sense that students would want to change this policy if their future kids have something to gain.
And just like that, with a hand wave, all those numbers from the beginning of this column fade into a soft-focus memory of Harvard Yard, steeped in tradition, in bloom on a nice spring day.
But, as a student who applied with legacy on both sides of my family, I’m in a privileged position to address this counter-argument—in addition to being in a privileged position in general. And, to me, the conception of legacy as a “nice thing” isn’t so clear-cut.
Now I know what you’re thinking: “You have legacy and you might actually complain that having it was not a ‘nice thing’ for you? Go f*ck yourself, you privileged piece of sh*t.”
I know, I know. But hear me out.
The answer to whether or not having legacy was a “nice thing” for me depends on whether or not I could have gotten into Harvard without it.
Having legacy does come with a good dose of guilt, as you can see from my self-aware move to include that made-up quote above. I’m not going to pretend this guilt is awful enough to ruin the Harvard experience. For most other legacy students I know, it’s more of an afterthought. But still, it’s hard to get over the fact that I’m a “privileged piece of sh*t” in my own mind, no matter how high my grades or SAT score were.
So it all comes down to a hypothetical. Could I have gotten in if Harvard didn’t use legacy? Let’s consider the two possible answers:
1. No: In this case, since the guilt isn’t strong enough to “ruin my Harvard experience,” getting in because of legacy would have been a “nice thing” for me.
2. Yes: The guilt would be unnecessary. So legacy not a “nice thing” anymore; in fact, it’s a “bad thing.”
So, overall, is legacy a “nice thing?” One could argue that since IQ is pretty heritable among affluent families and Harvard alumni raise kids to work hard and value education, maybe the majority of legacies would have gotten in without the preference. So it’s a “bad thing.” Or, one could argue that even if this was true, the benefit to the minority “undeserving” of a Harvard education largely outweighs the modest guilt felt by the majority, if it is a majority anyways. So it’s a “nice thing” overall. But then one could say that the “undeserving” probably would have gone to a good school anyway (since legacy here is only a “tie-breaker”), so it’s not that big of a benefit to get accepted here. So they don’t outweigh the “bad thing.” And it goes on and on…
So which is it?
With the admissions process as opaque as it is, your guess is as good as mine. It’s a game of hypotheticals.
But we do know a few things. The facts and figures show that eliminating legacy could be a productive first step in correcting the awful socioeconomic disparity at Harvard, without decreasing alumni donations. And we know that we don’t know exactly how “nice of a thing” this “nice thing” really is.
So, maybe it’s time for the legacy to go. In addition to a first step towards more diversity at Harvard, it may be the first step to a less opaque and less deeply insecure admissions process.
But that’s just the opinion of a privileged piece of sh*t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For some, Thanksgiving break was not so restful: In the wake of the St. Louis County grand jury decision not to indict Police Officer Darren Wilson for the killing of Michael Brown, thousands took to the street in protest.
Hands up, angry citizens cried out against what they saw as a miscarriage of justice—an unarmed teenager had been shot and killed, and his assassin would not be brought to trial. Though Brown’s case is now effectively closed, it could have significant ramifications for American society. We hope it will, and that the response to Brown’s death will effect lasting change in the way police officers deal with race and with unarmed suspects.
The legalities of the matter remain murky, even with thousands of pages of testimony made public. But, though it is difficult to cast judgment on the Ferguson grand jury’s decision without having heard and seen all its members heard and saw, it is possible to examine certain aspects of its process.
As others have described, instead of recommending an indictment in the typical manner, the St. Louis County prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch presented to the jury all available testimony and evidence and suggested they make the decision on their own. McCulloch also refused to recuse himself from the case after some questioned his family ties to the police force. Whether McCulloch’s actions did not or did not conform to the lawful proceedings of a trial, the unorthodox way in which the grand jury reviewed Brown’s case cast doubt on the verdict’s validity in the minds of civilians, lessening the chance of fruitful public discussion about the issue.
In the place of such discussion have come riots, and they, too, have been handled with a lack of the care a situation as delicate as Brown’s killing deserves. McCulloch chose to announce the grand jury’s decision at 8:30 p.m., when darkness had fallen over Ferguson. That, along with the failure to deploy sufficient National Guard troops to contain the ensuing unrest, did more to hurt than to help keep Ferguson’s streets safe.
These were errors, but what happens in their wake could right wrongs more deeply entrenched in our national culture. Police departments should increase training to discourage racial profiling, and they should also institute other measures to monitor their officers. These could include body cameras to increase accountability, as well as stricter rules for when to use a weapon on an unarmed assailant (shooting at one 153 feet away, for example, should be expressly forbidden). If local police departments fall short of the task, the Justice Department should take action and apply pressure.
Brown’s shooting was a tragedy, and the hearts it broke are unlikely to heal in the near future. Change, too, will only come with great effort and even more time. But it is effort worth exerting and time worth spending. Every day, another life is at stake.

A study published by researchers from the School of Public Health and Cambridge Health Alliance found that police officers face a higher risk of sudden cardiac death during high-stress activities than when they are conducting routine duties.
The paper follows a previous study on the risk of sudden cardiac death members of the fire service face in stressful versus non-emergency situations.
“We had done previous studies in the fire service where we demonstrated that the risk of an acute cardiovascular death is greatly increased during strenuous duties like putting out a fire or responding to an alarm, conducting some sort of emergency rescue compared to routine duties,” said the study's senior author Stefanos N. Kales, an associate professor at the Medical School and the School of Public Health.
“We thought that similar effects and phenomena could be occurring among law enforcement officers, but obviously we needed to put together a study to see if that hypothesis was true,” he said.
According to the study, which was published in the British Medical Journal, police spend about 25 percent of their time in high-stress situations, including suspect restraints, altercations, and chases. These types of environments cause 30 to 70 times higher risk of sudden cardiac death among police officers compared to routine or non-emergency activities. Even physical training, a task most officers said they do not find very stressful, saw a 20 to 25 times higher risk for sudden cardiac death than routine work.
“The fact that 10 percent of the deaths are coming from heart disease, which is a largely preventable condition, means that officers can either get in better shape or maintain high levels of physical fitness throughout their career and dramatically decrease their risk,” Kales said. “Police departments can also take measures such as making sure police officers don't smoke or use tobacco and give them regular medical examines.”
Kales said he and his fellow researchers plan to continue their work in studying law enforcement by looking at factors such as prevention and control to make dangerous jobs safer.
“Hopefully they will be able to perform their job more effectively, as well,” Kales said.

While many students traveled off campus for home-cooked meals and family reunions this Thanksgiving, students staying at Harvard used the temporary lull to catch up on sleep, focus on work, and sample the dishes they had come to expect from the holiday.
From 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Thursday, students flocked to Adams House dining hall for a traditional Thanksgiving dinner featuring New England classics such as cider-glazed ham, roast turkey, and three different types of pies—apple, pecan, and pumpkin.
Surrounded by the golden tones of Adams and the din of conversation, students found a warm, comfortable atmosphere.
“It feels very homey and nice,” Benjamin J. Rasmussen ’15-’16 said. “I’m not getting any work done. Just hanging out.”
Other students praised Harvard University Dining Services and the College for creating a welcoming environment.
Gurbani Kaur ’17 said, “I love HUDS because HUDS is literally the most inclusive and caring [group of] people. They went out of their way [to do this dinner]...so I really appreciate it.”
For many freshmen, this Thanksgiving was their first away from home.
“Although I do miss my family, I think Harvard is doing a very good job of integrating me and making me feel like I’m part of this community,” Javier Cuan-Martinez ’18, a student from California, said. “Later today some of my friends and I are going to have Thanksgiving dinner and it’s going to be a lot of fun. And I’m just enjoying myself with all the snow and everything.”
Despite the relaxed nature of Thanksgiving break, some students said they set ambitious work goals.
“I have to get a lot of work done,” Corbin T. Gearhart ’18 said. “[I’ve got] a few final papers to work on. Nobody from my entryway is here, so I kind of have the dorm to myself.”
For Kaur, balance was key in enjoying her break.
“I’m doing schoolwork, I’m spending time with my friends, and I’m calling home and talking to my family,” Kaur said. Responding to a friend's suggestion that they explore Cambridge, she said, “That could be fun. We should go do that.”
Regardless of workload, many students found Thanksgiving break to be a reminder to slow down and reflect.
“I think that this break is mainly so I can ‘destress-ify,’ for the most part, for the coming finals season,” said Martinez. “I’m thankful for Harvard, for my friends, my family. I’m very thankful for the food. That turkey was pretty nice.”

Rachael C. Stein ’17 was arrested in Boston last Tuesday evening on a “disorderly person” charge at a rally protesting a St. Louis County grand jury’s decision not to indict a white Missouri police officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teenager.
Stein, along with dozens of other protesters arrested that night, was arraigned Wednesday morning in court. Like others, Stein’s misdemeanor charge was downgraded to a civil infraction.
According to Stein, she had been at the front of the rally at the time of her arrest, facing police officers who blocked the protesters' entrance to Interstate 90 near South Station.
Delfina S. Martinez-Pandiani ’17, who was near Stein when she was arrested, said that protesters and police on the scene were pushing against one another. According to Martinez-Pandiani, the protesters in the back jostled those in the front forward in a “domino effect,” while a number of police officers were trying to force the protesters back.
Stein alleged that “unnecessary force was used in the arrests,” including her own. The Boston Globe reported that other protesters have made similar allegations.
Stein, who went to the hospital to have her injuries documented after her arraignment, said she suffered a mild concussion and damage to her ear cartilage from being forced down during her initial arrest. She also said she experienced wrist abrasions and tendon and nerve compression resulting in loss of sensation in her arm from her restraints.
While the arrested protesters are currently filing incident reports, Stein said it is presently “unclear” whether they will come together to file for alleged police brutality.
Both Stein and Martinez-Pandiani expressed their surprise at the perceived violence during the arrest, characterizing police officers as otherwise “stoic” throughout the night.
“The policemen in general were very calm, very serene, and very understanding…. That was important for the peaceful protest,” Martinez-Pandiani said.
Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who attended the rally and left after the group reached the I-90 entrance, said she saw only one forceful interaction when police officers knocked down protesters who had latched onto a truck being let into the blocked highway.
“I don’t think it was as violent as I think it could have been,” Wigglesworth said.
Stein was back on the streets Friday participating in a smaller demonstration related to the Ferguson decision. Roughly 50 demonstrators marched outside the Prudential Center in a protest organized by Black Lives Matter Boston, which had also planned Tuesday’s rally.
Stein said her arrest at Tuesday’s protest has only increased her desire to attend similar protests.
“The fact that people were arrested at a peaceful protest because they were rightfully outraged is perpetuating my anger on this issue and making me want to participate even more [in similar protests],” Stein said. She added that she hoped her experience does not discourage people from participating in similar protests, particularly “white allies.”
“If there’s any further action, I’d probably go, and get as many Harvard students as I can to go with me,” Stein said.

Researchers at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and the Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology Department have successfully developed pain-sensing neurons from mouse and human skin cells, according to a report published in Nature Neuroscience in late November.
The study specifically aimed to simulate primary afferent nociceptors, very specialized pain-sensing neurons.
According to head researcher Clifford J. Woolf, a professor of Neurology and Neurobiology at the Medical School, the findings may lead to development of more effective pain medications, better methods to evaluate who is at risk for developing chronic pain, and ways to combat pain complications resulting from cancer chemotherapy.
“What we’ve been able to do with stem cell technology for the first time is recreate some of the key elements of the nervous system by taking one cell and turning it into a particular other cell,” Woolf said. “This enables us for the first time to really dissect how human neurons function in the nervous system.”
For Woolf, the study is a culmination of many years of research, previously done only in mouse cells.
“The fact that we can even create these cells with a human gives us the opportunity to study the mechanisms of the way human nervous systems work that haven’t been possible before,” Woolf said.
Tony L. Yaksh, co-director of the Pain and Symptom Management Core of the University of California at San Diego’s Regional Cancer Center, emphasized the study’s role in raising new questions for further research.
“I think this is highly innovative and an extremely well-done paper,” Yaksh said. “I’d say this represents a very concerted, well-organized group effort to define this very critical issue. It leaves you with more questions than before you read the paper, but it starts the ball rolling in a very exciting way.”
Yaksh also highlighted the importance of the study in streamlining gene-specific treatment.
“The significance is [that] this allows us to define a mechanism that may be relevant to pain transmission in humans without having to euthanize a human being,” Yaksh said.
Yaksh called attention to the study’s relevance to the issue of pain variance across individuals, manifested in either different pain thresholds or the different degrees to which patients experience postoperative pain.
“Some people with a certain genetic makeup tend to have worse postoperative pain,” Yaksh said. “This particular thing that Clifford [Woolf] has done is this: let’s take the people who have a worse pain state and let’s find out what’s different about their genes.”
The fabrication of pain-sensing neurons holds potential for individualizing analysis of pain felt by patients and developing more specialized treatment.

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team ended a week of crosstown rivalry matchups by going 1-1 this weekend on the road at Northeastern and Boston College. The team finished the series with a win, loss, and tie, leaving room for improvement as conference competition heats up.
HARVARD 4, NORTHEASTERN 3
The Huskies (6-7-3, 5-4 WHEA) jumped out to an early 2-0 lead Saturday against the Crimson (3-2-2, 2-1-1 ECAC) with both goals scored by sophomore forward Hayley Scamurra. Both scoring opportunities for the Huskies came on power plays, taking advantage of the Harvard penalty kill unit. Scamurra’s first goal came on a man-advantage while the Crimson was caught in a change of lines, while her second was tallied off of a five on three advantage that saw the defense scrambling to guard the blueline.
“Sometimes it’s a good thing to have your weaknesses exposed so that you can attack them,” Harvard senior Lyndsey Fry said. “One thing that was great was that we had an opportunity to come back and see how well we could respond. I think we showed a ton of resilience in the game.”
Harvard answered back quickly, scoring its first two goals in the remaining minutes of the first period. Junior forward Miye D’Oench scored her seventh goal of the season, as three Crimson players came together to force the puck past Northeastern goalkeeper Chloe Desjardins. Co-captain Samantha Reber fed a pass to classmate Hillary Crowe who then found D’Oench on the wing who shoveled it out for the score.
Freshman Lexie Laing scored Harvard’s only power play goal over five tries throughout the night, tying the game just before the teams headed to their locker rooms for the first intermission.
The puck did not cross the goal line of either net until the third frame, when Huskies freshman forward Denisa Krizova found a hole in the Crimson defense for the team’s third power play goal of the night. Northeastern was able to capitalize on three of its five power play opportunities during the game while Harvard saw only one of its three man-advantages produce a goal.
“It was definitely tough seeing that they scored those three goals off of the power play,” sophomore defenseman Abbey Frazer said. “We probably just have to be a little more disciplined because they got away with power plays that were five on three, and that can be prevented if we are more disciplined.”
Crowe and sophomore forward Sydney Daniels sealed the victory for the Crimson with a goal each late in the third period, giving Harvard its only win of the tour.
BOSTON COLLEGE 10, HARVARD 2
Facing off against the top-seeded Eagles (15-0-1, 9-0-0 WHEA) proved to be a difficult task for the Crimson, as BC scored eight unanswered goals in the second and third periods of the game en route to a 10-2 victory on Friday.
The two Harvard goals were tallied by Crowe and junior co-captain Michelle Picard.
The mood of the game was set early on, as the Eagles scored a goal just 25 seconds into the contest. Picard answered with her goal late in the first period, but BC quickly took the lead back early in the secon. After Crowe’s goal at 4:17 in the second frame, the Crimson offense went silent while the Eagles added eight goals to first take the lead and then run with it to seal the victory.
Junior Emerance Maschmeyer saw the majority of time in goal for Harvard, saving 26 of the Huskies’ 31 shots that she faced over her 44:06 between the posts. Sophomore Brianna Laing took over for the remainder of the game, saving just six of the 11 shots she saw from BC. Maschmeyer was credited with the loss, putting her overall record for the season at 0-2-2.
“[BC has] been playing together for a little longer than we have and I know that’s no excuse, but they showed what could happen if we keep putting the pieces together in our game, where we can be at the end of the season,” Fry said. “This game shows us where we can be at the end of the season. We have a lot of time between now and the national championship and we’ll keep working hard to get there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing at the Mohegan Sun Casino, the Harvard women’s basketball team saw its string of luck run out late against Temple and suffered an 81-69 defeat.
Although the Crimson (3-3) held the Owls (3-3) to just 40 percent shooting from the field, Temple had an ace up its sleeve in freshman guard Khadijah Berger, whose four crucial threes off the bench proved to be the difference. The loss was Harvard’s third in its last five games.
“It is definitely disappointing,” co-captain Kaitlyn Dinkins said. “Temple is very beatable, especially given how we played in the first half. It is the same message out of our two losses. We played to the [gameplan] in the first half, and then in the second half [were] not able to do that.”
Harvard took a 34-32 lead into halftime behind the strong play of senior forward Temi Fagbenle. The Crimson’s leading scorer had 10 points in the first half and finished with 23 to go along with a program-record 24 rebounds.
However, Harvard quickly fell behind in the second half as it continued a disturbing early season trend of failing to hang on to the ball. The Crimson repeatedly shot itself in the foot time and time again with 17 turnovers, repeatedly giving Temple free possessions. Playing with house money, Temple turned the turnovers into 24 points.
“We are a very fundamental team and we like to play our system, our basketball,” said senior point guard Ali Curtis. “They pushed the tempo, and I think early on that dictated our pace of the game. We made some silly turnovers and forced some passes I think we would [usually] not.”
Despite the turnovers, Harvard held a 52-51 lead with 11 minutes to go before Temple picked up the pace, scoring the next 13 points to go ahead by 12 with just over seven minutes to play. The Crimson managed just four shots in the stretch as Temple doubled down on its full-court pressure and began to hit the jackpot from three, making four of its 11 second-half attempts.
As Harvard fell behind, it increasingly began to take on more risk.  In poker parlance, the Crimson’s offensive strategy might be best described as playing jack-eight under the gun—taking on unnecessary risk while hoping for good fortune.
The Crimson rolled the dice early and often, launching 25 treys on the night and making just five. In the second half, with the game slipping away, the Crimson connected on three of 15 attempts, including just one of its last seven as the team tried repeatedly to cut into a double-digit deficit late.
“We knew they would key on our inside play and we are usually a good three-point shooting team, so we usually take those shots if they are open,” Curtis said. “[But] I think in the second half, we could have worked the ball inside and out and gotten the defense moving.”
While it struggled from outside, the Crimson was able to extend possession after possession on the offensive glass. Fagbenle had 10 offensive rebounds alone, and the team rebounded nearly 42 percent of its own misses, generating 18 second-chance points.
On the defensive end, however, Harvard struggled to replicate such success. After a first half in which the Crimson held the Owls to just seven-of-23 shooting on the interior, Temple found increased success inside throughout the second half. Six different Temple players had an offensive rebound as the team took home 17 offensive boards for 18 second-chance points of its own.
Overall, Harvard had just five blocks against 22 fouls as the Owls drove inside at will in the second frame, making half their shots and drawing 19 free throw attempts. Temple’s leading scorer Tanaya Atkinson had eight of her 20 points in the second half, including a three-point play with 13 minutes to go to give her team the lead.
“We knew they were going to be an athletic, fast-paced team,” Curtis said. “I thought that we stopped drives well in the first half, but in the second half we got away from that and they started beating us to the basket.”

Happy Monday, and welcome back to campus, Harvard! Now that you’ve had a few days off to remember what home life was like—your friends and family, your house, your non-HUDS food—maybe you're already starting your countdown for winter break. Or maybe if your Thanksgiving was filled with those dreaded visits to Aunt Susan, loud siblings and a complete lack of privacy, you're desperately hanging onto these last few weeks in Cambridge before you return home. Either way, with only three days of classes left before reading period begins, congratulations on making it to the last full Monday of the year! Started from the bottom now we're here?
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Today will see a high of 55 degrees and a low of 28 degrees. On the one hand, you may want to hang up your winter parka; but on the other hand, the extra warmth might be necessary considering the 10-15 mph winds. However, overall not too bad for the first day of December.

It was bound to happen sooner or later. The day has come when even Yalies themselves admit that they want to to take Harvard courses, and Harvard is responding by loaning their best and brightest to charitably compensate for the lesser institution’s department.
Well, perhaps it’s not as dramatic as that.
It was recently announced that Harvard and Yale have each approved a joint-institution venture for Computer Science 50 to be taught on both campuses. Yale students will have the opportunity to take CS50 under Harvard’s instruction beginning Fall 2015 via livestream and recorded lessons on demand, as confirmed at the final 2014 CS50 lecture last week.
Of course, no announcement of any weight would be complete without the familiar and well-received antics of Sam Clark from “On Harvard Time” leading a tour of “actual Yalies” into gothic-architecture-free Sanders Theater. After explaining that Sanders would be the site of the livestreamed lectures for the new course, Clark and the Yalies posed for a humorous impromptu selfie with speaker David J. Malan ’99 before continuing on with the tour off stage.
Along with shared lectures, there will also be sections, office hours, and support staff at Yale to help students learn introductory computer science in tandem with Harvard, according to Malan. But perhaps the most noteworthy detail of this new joint venture between ivy universities is the new role of Harvard’s Jason C. Hirschhorn '15.
Hirschhorn will be sent to work full-time at Yale, working on the ground to establish the program and oversee the work of the other teaching assistants on Yale’s end.
While many people would (rightly) feel less than ecstatic about being assigned to live and work in New Haven, Hirschhorn described the effort as “an amazing opportunity to bring together students from two universities in an immersive and shared educational experience.”
Much as we love to display the (many) ways Yale cannot (and will never) match up to Harvard, you can’t begrudge the incredible opportunity at Hirschhorn’s disposal. After graduation, the enthusiastic Harvard senior will have not only a full-time job as an instructor, but also the chance to engage in work relevant to his thesis and interests.
“I'm very much looking forward to helping form a community and culture among students in New Haven that meets (and maybe even exceeds) the exceptional one that already exists for students in Cambridge,” Hirschhorn said.
While Yale reaching Harvard’s standard of excellence is highly unlikely, you have to give him props for his good attitude.
Godspeed, Hirschhorn. We wish you well.
