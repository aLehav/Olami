After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, Fox aired the series premiere of its creatively titled Exorcist spin-off, “The Exorcist.” When the show’s creation was first announced in May of this past year, much debate arose regarding whether or not the series would do the original 1973 thriller justice. Nearly three million viewers tuned in to find out that although the original film is apparently unbeatable, the new series did a decent job of trying.
The show presents exactly what one would expect from a 2016 version of the exorcism phenomenon: A woman hears noises in her home, jumps to conclusions and declares a demonic presence, and ultimately contacts a sexy young priest to save the day. Although this premise seems stereotypical and predictable for a horror series, the episode’s execution renders it continuously intriguing.
The premiere is entitled “And Let My Cry Come Unto Thee,” an unusually long name that doesn’t really say much of anything. Its plot centers around Angela (Geena Davis), who suspects her daughter’s demonic possession and seeks help from Father Tomas (Alfonso Herrera). Rather oddly, every female character seems to flirt with Herrera at one point throughout the 45-minute span, which gives me a feeling something unorthodox will occur in the episodes to come.
One element of concern is that the mood remains pretty constant throughout the duration of the episode. Every frame is relatively dark and gloomy and showcases an element of eeriness typical to the horror genre. If I had a dollar for every time one of the actors flashed a smile or sported a bright color, I would have about two and a half dollars. This choice is not entirely detrimental, however, as the ever-present gloom creates a perpetual feeling of suspense.
Additionally, the plot of the show escalates at an unusually speedy rate. Within the first 20 minutes, Angela ends up in Father Tomas’s office talking about the presence of an evil spirit, even though we had only been shown about 30 seconds of potentially demonic behavior by then. This fast-paced nature is a refreshing change from other horror TV series, however—“Pretty Little Liars” is on its seventh season and has yet to get to the point. Plus, it makes me feel as if a lot is going to occur this season, as if the show is heading towards something great.
The acting is rather weak. However, the plot is so simultaneously perplexing and enthralling that I don’t even mind. In one scene, a black crow violently crashes through a window prior to a commercial break, and the occurrence is literally never addressed again, as if it had never existed. At that point, Davis’s ability to convincingly scream is the least of my concerns. From where did the crow appear? Is it hurt? Why are people acting like this is normal? However, as “Insidious: Chapter 3” has taught me, sometimes horror isn’t supposed to make sense; sometimes one can find comfort in such confusion.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Compartmentalization kept me sane, or so I thought. When faced with a wave of seemingly insurmountable tasks, I have always divided life’s various challenges into small, digestible categories. Likewise, my schedule revolves around a system of time units, with each unit consisting of 30 minutes. Through this unit system, I track the amount of time dedicated to a specific activity and determine whether the returns from that activity match the investment.
For better or worse, the Army reinforced my quest to categorize all aspects of my life. Now I instinctively roll my t-shirts and socks, insert items into my backpack based on their weight and utility, and regularly rely on acronyms when speaking. Military time dominates my watch, computer, and agenda. My ears and scalp have learned to love the wind’s sweet embrace, prompting me to keep my hair well regulated (a far cry from my hippie high school days).
Harvard’s atmosphere only heightened my desire to classify everything and everyone based on their alleged utility and cost in terms of time units. Unfortunately, this tendency to categorize objects has extended beyond the inanimate world. My extracurricular life soon became an extension of my professional life. Time spent with friends and family, which I once held holy, also transformed into a series of calculations involving returns and investments.
Even meals weren’t exempt from being treated like appointments. Despite the frequency with which students state “Let’s catch a meal,” I’ve always found the phrase particularly unnerving. I, like anyone else, enjoy eating. However, the aforementioned statement always seems robotic, converting meals—a refuge from school—into yet another series of mandatory meetings.
However, unlike inanimate t-shirts or socks, humans typically notice when someone they love has begun to schedule their conversations like you would a dentist appointment. My relationships with others quickly devolved into a system of lifeless transactions. Rather than aid me, my schedule consumed my life. I lived to serve my agenda; I had become nothing more than the sum of my routines.
People aren’t objects you can stuff in your rucksack based on convenience; they require your individual attention. More importantly, cold professionalism only begets cold professionalism. The few days I spent at home this summer were a rude awakening; I came to the realization that my family, whom I supposedly strove to protect, felt as if I had intentionally distanced myself from them. I had finally succeeded in segmenting my entire life into a string of lifeless appointments.
This isn’t a condemnation of time management, nor am I condoning a spontaneous approach to all parts of life. Meticulous planning remains key to victory over life’s most difficult endeavors. Furthermore, just as people notice mechanical routines, individuals can easily distinguish when one takes an overly nonchalant, impromptu approach to life’s challenges. But these words serve as a warning; either extreme on the planning continuum can spell disaster for one’s relationships with others, as well as one’s mental health.
I don’t plan on abandoning my time unit system, nor do I intend to suppress my love for utility, rolled up t-shirts, or starting every morning with the ideal ratio of Cracklin’ Oat Bran and nonfat milk (for those of you that are curious, it’s 1.5:1). However, I hope to embrace more spontaneity during this coming semester. After all, the Army’s already sectioned off a significant chunk of my life; I might as well use my occasional free time to engage in a shenanigan or two (of the legal variety, of course). Hell, maybe I’ll even give another brand of cereal a chance.
More importantly, I hope others learn to embrace uncertainty. It’s alright to not know what you’re doing next summer. It’s perfectly fine to start October feeling just as confused as you were when you started school in August. Organize the occasional misadventure. Make a fool of yourself, and allow a bit of chaos to seep into your schedule.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As religious dogmatism has lost its influence over American political culture, a new dogma has emerged. Finding its roots in what liberals like Dave Rubin have taken to calling the regressive left, the new creed has but one law: “To disagree is to be deplorable.” Deviance not tolerated.
The rise of Donald Trump—a lying, amoral, corrupt, racist-pandering charlatan who is not qualified to lead his local kindergarten’s bake sale—is often cited as evidence of the veracity of the creed. But the rise of Trump is not so much indicative of the bigotry of the Republican electorate as it is of the age-tested truism that dogma breeds unthinking resistance.
Recently—since around the turn of the century—the left’s prohibition on dissent has come to dominate their thinking. The pervasiveness of the creed is felt perhaps most sharply on college campuses, where adherence to the new law is well-documented and has recently expressed itself in ugly and destructive ways. Conservative media outlets are dominated by examples, new ones appearing almost daily, of figures on campus or in the media smugly dismissing those who disagree with them as racist for everything from criticizing the IRS to voting for black politicians. Political differences are understandable, and the hackneyed counsel to “hit your opponent where it hurts” is as much a part of the day to day trudge through the trenches of modern American politics as anything else. But for too long, the left has rejected the idea that two moral human beings can come to different conclusions on a variety of issues.
By emphasizing the impossibility of benign dissent, Democrats have won elections. But liberal alarmism on issues of identity has always been a shortsighted goal—as in the case of the boy who cried wolf, the village folk will only believe the hysterics for so long.
In direct response to years of these vapid accusations and (often feigned) outrage, it has become dogma on the right that the when the left cries “bigot!” the proper reaction—always—is a disappointed shake of the head and a downward smirk. Thus, alarmism on the left has bred ossification and codified unbelief on the right. Effective communication between the sides was severed. Everyone on the right who opposed Donald Trump on moral grounds was immediately declared to be Of The Left, a “cuck” and a traitor who wished to see Hillary Clinton elected. We destroyed our ability to defend against the wolves, and perhaps we deserve to pay the price. In any case, our wolf has arrived.
Donald Trump is a bigot. Many of his comments about women are horrible. Democratic politicians correctly argue that they have been pointing this out for months, and that they therefore cannot possibly bear blame for his ascension. But they have made the same accusations about Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, and likely most every Republican politician of whom you have ever heard. These accusations all looked shallow, desperate, and outright false to most conservative Americans. With this precedent set, why should the average Republican voter treat the allegations against Trump any differently?
The problem is that a broken clock is right twice a day.
The left has been crying Trump for a generation. Millennial conservatives have never known anything other than a left more trigger-happy than the NRA—a left ever-ready to thoughtlessly dismiss people about whom coastal elites have little genuine understanding as bitter clingers or deplorables.
The left has in this way lost the ability to effectively call out bigotry of any sort. Because of the standards developed over the years, accusations of Republican bigotry must always operate one level higher than the truth: Mitt Romney, instead of having a different worldview to be evaluated on its merits, is a racist—and if Mitt et al. are racists, then Donald Trump can’t just be a racist—his bigotry must be elevated to a nearly Hitlerian magnitude.
We are creating a dangerous self-perpetuating cycle. The more accusations are stretched, the less credible they will become, and the more likely it is that the right will refuse to acknowledge any form of bigotry, regardless of blatancy. Conservatives have thus been forced into a very difficult position in this election. Either they grudgingly embrace The Donald—and overtly do what they have always been accused of doing covertly: spending their moral capital on a politician who flirts with racism—or they disavow Trump, thereby granting a patina of credibility to a leftist worldview that will in the future be used to smear them, attacking them as merely less raucous, more tactful incarnations of the Trumpian worldview. Conservatives should know that the “Strange New Respect” given to them by the left for opposing Trump is merely loaned, and as Ross Douthat learned in the aftermath of his recent column on Samantha Bee, easily revoked.
Of course, the right also bears blame for the ascension and normalization of a detestable man. “Whoever fights with monsters,” Nietzsche said, “should look to it that he himself does not become a monster.” As the right battled in vain to deflect superfluous allegations of racism, they became lax and reactionary, and, finally, the Nietzschean abyss gazed back into them, releasing Donald Trump from its hellish maw.
The fault borne by the right for the rise of Trump is already clear to us, though, having been shouted from the rooftops by everyone left of Reagan. But what perhaps is still murky is the fact that, in searching for the Dr. Frankenstein to blame for the Trumpian beast, the left ought to gaze—for a moment—into the mirror.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students unsatisfied with campus social life often take aim at the administration for failing to create an inclusive, high-quality social experience for them. Yet many other students, and even one ex-Dean of the College, have complained that administrators have taken a heavy-handed approach to regulating social life on campus. Paradoxically, it appears that for many Harvard either veers towards encroaching upon or overlooking the realm of student life.
Two recent developments betoken answers to these concerns: Adams House has introduced a new, dedicated party space, and new Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair has expressed a desire to take a more hands-off approach to shaping Harvard’s student experience. We appreciate both of these strategies to improve social life on campus, and hope that Harvard can find a middle ground between micromanaging students’ social life and neglecting their need for better resources.
Harvard lacks modern, inclusive spaces on campus where students can gather and throw parties. Social spaces already available to students are outdated and overbooked. Many of the campus’s large parties are hosted in dorm rooms, which is symptomatic of both the scarcity and inadequacy of current social outlets. If new spaces like the one recently opened by Adams House are to  provide students with opportunities to socialize on campus, they must be comfortable, spacious, and inviting.
If students find Harvard’s on-campus spaces lacking, they have no shortage of alternatives. Many go to Final Clubs and other off-campus spaces to take advantage the ample space and attractive environment they cannot find elsewhere.  Administrators, in turn, have expressed a desire to coax students away from off-campus spaces and bring them back to Harvard proper, but have not yet created an appropriate set of incentives. If they are serious about keeping students on campus, they ought to follow the lead set by Adams House and actually give students spaces they can make their own.
This is not to say administrators should micromanage students’ social lives. While it remains to be seen exactly how Dean O’Dair envisions implementing her “hands-off” vision in her new role, we hope that she chooses to empower students to create a social scene on campus that they actually want. A prime example of a successful student-created social experience is the [BLANK] party, which brought together a cross-section of the student body. It proved that students are not just capable of designing their own on-campus social experiences, but can excel at doing so.
We hope that these recent announcements portend a happy medium on campus where students have access to a variety of attractive social options and are also empowered with the social spontaneity that no top-down plan can replicate. The university has been bogged down in the social space debate for at least a year now. Even though it has been a divisive issue on campus, a refrain has bridged all sides of the debate—that the administration has not adequately addressed student concerns.

UPDATED: Oct. 4, 2016, at 8:20 p.m.
Harvard’s dining hall workers will report to picket lines Wednesday morning instead of the dining halls as their union initiates a much-anticipated strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with the University.
This is the first time Harvard’s dining hall workers will walk off the job during the academic school year in the union’s history of bargaining with the University, according to Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston-based union that represents the dining workers.
The strike will go into effect 6 a.m. Wednesday and last indefinitely. In an email sent to undergraduates earlier Tuesday, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, wrote that three upperclassmen dining halls—Kirkland, Dunster and Cabot—will be closed starting on Wednesday for the duration of the strike, though the remaining dining halls will have extended hours.
Additionally, Fly-By—an alternative dining option for upperclassmen—will continue to run and be expanded to include freshmen. Students will not be able to order take out options.
Harvard and its dining service workers have been negotiating, to no avail, for nearly four months in a tense back-and-forth. Both sides met for their 19th bargaining session Tuesday in an effort to hammer out a new contract before a midnight deadline.
Last week, Local 26 announced that they would wait until midnight on Tuesday to announce a strike, but according to Local 26 spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck, the union thought it was “clear” around 5:30 p.m. Tuesday that they would not reach an agreement with the University before that deadline.
According to University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga, Harvard’s bargaining team offered to continue bargaining until the 11:59 p.m. deadline, but said the union left the session at 5:30 p.m. When asked whether the union intended to continue bargaining past the time it released its announcement, Ten Eyck declined to comment.
The union has asked Harvard to increase HUDS workers salaries to $35,000 a year and to guarantee summer employment to interested workers; HUDS employees generally do not work during school recesses. Harvard has offered to increase HUDS workers wages 10 percent over the course of five years, and on Monday offered a summer stipend that would provide HUDS workers who were available to work during the summer anywhere from $150 to $250 per week, “even if there are no open shifts.” The amount of the stipend would depend on the worker’s tenure at Harvard.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a federal organization that aggregates labor data based on profession, from May 2015 indicates that the annual mean wage for food preparation and serving-related occupations in the Boston area was $27,690.
Health benefits have also proved a contentious issue at the bargaining table. Harvard has offered a plan offered to other campus unions—which would eliminate deductibles but increase copayments. In a bargaining session Monday, and with the strike deadline looming, Harvard proposed a series of “enhanced” health care options and wage supplements.
Harvard also extended two healthcare options to the union. The first would create a premium contribution tier for workers earning $55,000 or less annually in which Harvard would contribute 87 percent of the premium of the lowest-cost plan. In addition, Harvard would fund  a “flexible savings account” of $80 per year in 2018 and 2019, and $40 in 2020.
These proposed changes would not be implemented until 2018.
In the second health care option, Harvard would contribute the “equivalent cost of the Harvard University Group Health Plan enrollment premium” to a health insurance plan offered by Local 26.
Local 26 has rejected all offers.
When asked what the union has proposed at the bargaining table, Local 26 representatives declined to offer specifics other than that they do not want dining workers to have to pay more money in out-of-pocket health costs.
Dining halls in upperclassman Houses and Annenberg switched their metal utensils with plastic forks, knives and spoons earlier in the day Tuesday. By lunch, most of them had replaced their dishes with plastic plates and bowls.
HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin did not respond to a request for comment about why the University had swapped in plastic utensils.

In the hopes of promoting safer driving, Boston city agencies have partnered with local driving analytics company Cambridge Mobile Telematics to launch the “Boston’s Safest Driver” mobile application and competition on Monday.The app collects various metrics on users' driving. Local users of the app who participate in the competition will receive points based on how safe they are behind the wheel, with top scoring drivers receiving monetary awards. The Boston Transportation Department, the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, and safe driving initiative Vision Zero Task Force are all partnering with Cambridge Mobile Telematics on the app.“We think the real value here is self-reflection on what you’re doing on the roadway,” co-Chair of the Boston Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics, Kristopher Carter, said.Until the competition's end on Dec. 3, the Arbella Insurance Foundation will fund more than $9,000 in prizes to the app’s “top drivers,” including a $2,000 grand prize.The competition aims to meet Vision Zero Task Force’s goal of eventually eliminating serious traffic hazards using educational, engineering, and enforcement solutions. The Boston’s Safest Driver app works toward this goal by providing an educational tool to help people recognize and improve their own driving habits.The app collects metrics on drivers’ speed, acceleration, braking, turning, and phone use while driving. According to Cambridge Mobile Telematics founder and chief scientist Samuel Madden, the app uses a phone’s position and acceleration sensors to collect some metrics. The app also collects aggregate data on its users’ driving. According to Madden and Carter, however, it is difficult to tell how the city of Boston would use this aggregate data to further combat traffic hazards.“We need at least a few weeks, if not a month’s [worth of] data to tell us, ‘You know, okay, what should we do next? Where is this working, where isn’t [it]?’” Carter said. “What other problems should we be tackling? How should we use this to inform our strategy going forward on making our streets safer?"While anyone can use the app to evaluate his or her driving habits, Carter said that users can only participate in the competition if they are from Boston or the 100 surrounding towns and cities.

The smell of freshly baked bread and pastries wafting through the air along Massachusetts Avenue will soon grow familiar to passersby with the opening of Tatte Bakery and Cafe, a European-style establishment that features a baker on site 24/7.
The new eatery opened bright and early at 7 a.m. Tuesday morning in the former home of Panera Bread. Customers were eager to glimpse the state-of-the-art bakery the restaurant features, where workers can be seen baking pastries and bread right behind the counter. The cafe employs bakers around the clock, a feature that the chain also has at its Kendall Square location.

“If you pass by the store at anytime, you can smell the bread,” Tatte’s founder Tzurit Or said. “The whole street smells like bread.”
Tatte’s opening has been highly anticipated since the chain announced early last March that it was replacing Panera—which owns a majority stake in Tatte—at the two-story storefront at 1288 Mass. Ave.
For the next seven months, Or said she put a lot of thought into redesigning the space. She said that when she was first offered the space, she did not fall in love with it right away. It wasn’t until she contacted engineers and contractors to confirm the feasibility of rebuilding the staircase, to make the restaurant as a whole more cohesive, that she decided to design the space in the theme of an old European train station.
“It came to my head that with the European train station design, I could play with the design of the two floors and the stairs,”  Or said. “If you want to come in and just grab your pastry or sandwich to go, you can go to the first floor and just do it very quickly, but if you have the time such as waiting for a train that leaves in an hour or two, you can go upstairs.”
To complete the look, Or spent months searching for an old European train station clock to be hung from the second floor to the first floor to “create the connection between the two floors.”
“There are a few elements that give us the industrial train station look and I wanted to make sure that once you go inside, you can see the second floor,” Or said. “They’re connected so you can see what’s happening upstairs.”
Tatte’s second floor features a coffee bar where the eatery drafts its cold brew coffee and hosts baking classes and events.
According to Or, Tatte decided to open a location in Harvard Square because the neighborhood fit the qualities that Tatte looks for when opening new storefronts: a large population of internationals, young professionals, and students. The bakery and cafe brand also has five other locations, including stores near MIT in Kendall Square and Boston University in Brookline.
“Tatte is not an American bakery,” Or said. “We don’t sell any American products so you have to have a crowd who is open to trying things.”
To prepare for the Oct. 4 opening, the staff started baking two days before the date, Or added.
Austin E. Sowa ’17 was among the students on the first day who enjoyed Tatte’s breakfast options, which include a variety of sandwiches and shakshuka, a North African and Middle Eastern dish of poached eggs with bell peppers, tomatoes, and feta cheese served in a pan with challah bread.
“I think they did a really nice job with the renovations,” Sowa said. “We don’t have a lot of breakfast options in the Square so having a quick on-the-go breakfast option right in the Square is really nice.”
The eatery is open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, and from 8 a.m. to 9.m. on Saturday and Sunday, and serves brunch all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

As Harvard’s dining services workers prepare to begin their strike Wednesday, students on the University’s Longwood campus in Boston are planning their own demonstration.
Students at the Medical and Dental Schools, as well as at the School of Public Health, are planning to boycott four cafeterias on the Longwood campus and to join picket lines with HUDS workers on Wednesday.
Several students in the Racial Justice Coalition, an HMS and Dental School student activist group that focuses on social justice issues, have been involved with the negotiations between HUDS and the University regarding health insurance.
According to Angel Reyes, one of the boycott's organizers and a student at HMS, at least 60 Medical School students are planning to boycott the four cafeterias and cafes that will remain open in Longwood when the strike begins. They will also be posting fliers to spread the word about the boycott, hoping to attract more students.
The deans of finance and administration at HMS, the Dental School, and HSPH sent an email to Longwood students Tuesday about the looming strike. According to the email, provided by HMS spokesperson Ekaterina D. Pesheva, there will be “limited offerings with reduced staffing” at two cafes in the New Research Building, the Medical School’s Courtyard Cafe, and the HSPH cafe. The Atrium cafeteria in the Medical School’s Tosteson Medical Education Center will be closed.
“In the event of a disruption, we will do our best to help you navigate the availability of food services in the Longwood area,” the email said.
Some students buy breakfast or lunch from these cafes during the workday, Reyes said, adding that students involved in the boycott will pack their meals or eat at nearby restaurants.
Pesheva did not comment on the increase in student activism in Longwood when asked.
Reyes said students are planning the boycott because, as medical students, they feel a responsibility to advocate for more affordable health care.
“We want to advocate for our patients and that means also ensuring that people have affordable health insurance,” Reyes said. “We do want to stand with them and show solidarity for HUDS workers.”
Members of the Racial Justice Coalition invited HUDS workers to present at their “Social Justice Summit” in September, where many first-years heard about dining workers’ challenges in obtaining affordable health care.
At a September bargaining session between University labor representatives and the HUDS worker union Local 26, four Medical School students presented their analysis that found Harvard’s initial health care proposal was “unaffordable under state government guidelines.”
Harvard spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga challenged that analysis, saying that it “takes the worst-case scenario under the Harvard plan and compares it to a best-case scenario in Mass. Health,” which is a state health insurance exchange.

A glass-roofed opera house, a collective housing building, and an organic farming commune are just a few of the 60 models at a Graduate School of Design exhibit that aims to challenge perceptions of modern Chinese architecture.
Curated by GSD visiting professor Xiangning Li, the exhibit is on display in the main gallery of GSD’s Gund Hall from Aug. 24 until Oct. 14. Physical models and written descriptions of a wide variety of innovative Chinese architecture from the 1980s and onward extend the length of the hallway.
Melany Park, a GSD doctoral student who helped curate the exhibit, said the exhibit seeks to challenge perceptions of Chinese architecture as completely state-controlled and defined by low-quality urban development. Since the economic reforms of the 1980s, private firms began pursuing experimental projects that she called “the birth of contemporary Chinese architecture.”
Models range from a sugar production workshop to schools and museums, and they are organized by the five general categories of “cultural, regeneration, digital, rural, and residential,” according to the exhibit’s description online.
Park described the exhibit’s theme, “critical pragmatism,” as “critical of economic speculation—the skyscrapers that go up and get sold for millions of dollars—but then it’s also pragmatic in dealing with the real conditions of China.”
“It’s highly imaginative but not not trying to deal with the realities of the social conditions as well. It’s critical but also pragmatic,” Park said. “Prior to this exhibition, Chinese contemporary architecture has been considered from an economically speculative, financially-burdened, and about property developers and brought more of the money-making side of buildings.”
Li’s team began planning in May and commissioned the New York-based architecture firm SO-IL to design the exhibit. The models were physically constructed and mailed from China by the architectural firms that designed the original buildings.
One of the exhibit’s goals is to spark dialogue about contemporary architecture in China, according to its description. The GSD has hosted seminars and lectures on Chinese architecture this fall, in tandem with the collection in Gund Hall.
Tairan An, a masters student in Design Studies at the GSD, echoed the far-reaching influence of the exhibit.

The Boston Redevelopment Authority announced a wide-ranging image revamp on Sept. 23, an update that agency officials and Allstonians say will not affect Harvard’s ongoing Allston developments and its relationship with the organization and the neighborhood.
Most notably, the revamp of the city’s urban planning body included a new website and a new name: the Boston Planning and Development Agency. Harvard has worked closely with the BPDA on all its Allston developments, including when drafting its institutional master plan for the area.
The BPDA began its reform efforts in January 2014 at the instigation of then-newly elected Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh. Walsh initiated two separate outside reviews of the BPDA, which led to the agency’s board of directors hiring Continuum, a Boston-based consultancy firm, to transform the organization’s image.
After a 14 week-long study of the BPDA’s interactions with constituents, Continuum developed a “new brand identity” and “organizational strategy” for the agency to communicate to residents across Boston, according to the BPDA website.
“Updating our logo will signal to the community that we’ve changed,” the new website states, citing the branding success of clothing company Patagonia’s “Don’t Buy This Jacket” campaign and Disney’s famous mouse ears.
Despite the larger surface-level changes, there will be little immediate impact on relations between Harvard, Allstonians, and the BPDA, agency spokesperson Gina Physic wrote in an email, adding that Gerald Autler, the BPDA’s senior project manager, will continue to manage the design and development review process for Harvard’s Allston projects.
John Bruno, the interim chair of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, also said he thought the rebranding would not have “much effect” on the operations of the task force, an advisory group organized by the BPDA that mediates interactions between Harvard, Allston residents, and the agency.
“I just don’t think it’ll be much of a change,” he said, adding that “the BRA [can] get bogged down in details in areas where maybe they shouldn’t, [so] if it helps to mitigate the process and procedures better, then I welcome the change.”
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that “Harvard will continue to work closely with both the BPDA and [the] community to ensure that its proposed plans emerge from the public process with the confidence and support of both the City and the neighborhood.”
The BPDA’s new website outlines the agency’s four “areas of focus” for the next 18 months, which comprise launching the new brand, prioritizing planning, designing a community meeting template, and focusing on internal communication strategies. Physic wrote in an emailed statement that these reforms are “meant to elevate the importance of comprehensive planning across the agency.”
Harry E. Mattison, an Allston resident who serves on the task force, said he was mostly indifferent to the rebranding effort.
“What the name of the organization is doesn’t really matter to me, it’s what they do,” he said. “If they’re going to continue to do really good planning that incorporates the concerns and interests and well-being of the neighborhood… what the logo they have is really secondary.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cash reserves for Harvard’s flagship Faculty have dwindled to “effectively zero,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said at a meeting of the body Tuesday.
Presenting an early draft of a Dean’s report at the first Faculty meeting of the semester, Smith offered details on the FAS operating budget, its hiring practices, and the near and long-term effects of recent disappointing returns on the University’s endowment.
While FAS administrators have worked to reduce costs, the Faculty has relied upon its reserves and unrestricted gifts from donors to fund its research initiatives and other projects like House renewal, Smith said. According to a May 2016 strategic assessment report, FAS efforts to renovate Harvard’s Houses have contributed to a “complete depletion” of FAS unrestricted reserves, down from $112 million in fiscal year 2013.
FAS receives half of its operating budget from the endowment, which could lead to tighter budgets in the coming years, Smith said. Harvard Management Company, the University’s investment arm, announced last month that Harvard returned negative 2 percent on its endowment during fiscal year 2016. The negative returns—in addition to the $1.7 billion HMC distributed to help fund the University’s annual budget—amounted to a decline of nearly $2 billion in the endowment’s value.
Despite these financial setbacks, Smith pointed to the FAS capital campaign’s passing its $2.5 billion goal as a positive source of revenue. Over the past two and a half years, FAS has benefited from two big-ticket gifts: $150 million from Kenneth C. Griffin '89 to help fund the Financial Aid portion of the campaign and $400 million from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson to endow his now-namesake School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
In the short term, FAS will need to invest in its research mission, balance budgets quickly, and look to replenish reserves, Smith said. Until FAS replenishes those reserves, unrestricted donations from alumni will fuel the spending pool, he said.
At the meeting, University professor Peter L. Galison ’77 asked University President Drew G. Faust for more transparency in discussing with the Faculty the impact of the endowment’s losses on FAS’ budgets. Faculty members would benefit from hearing from members of the Harvard Corporation and Harvard Management Company, Galison wrote in a follow-up email to The Crimson.
“We need a grownup financial discussion,” Galison said at the meeting, adding, “It affects everything from financial aid to hiring and retention of faculty. It really is an underpinning of all we aim to be.”
Faust said she would “welcome the opportunity” to discuss the endowment with the Faculty.
At the meeting, Faculty also heard from the two co-chairs of a committee charged with overseeing the implementation of a historic College policy penalizing members of single-gender, unrecognized social organizations.
In addition, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 directly addressed Faust during an open discussion period in which he questioned the University’s race-conscious admissions policies.
“Affirmative action is discrimination by race and by sex, therefore it is on its face unjust, assuming that justice means choosing according to merit regardless of race and sex,” Mansfield said.
Mansfield’s comments followed a recent Supreme Court decision, Fisher v. University of Texas, which upheld the constitutionality of race-conscious admissions for undergraduates. A group called Students for Fair Admissions is currently suing Harvard for its admissions policies, which the group claims are unfair to Asian American applicants.
Faust defended Harvard’s admissions policy, saying it promotes a diverse class of students and an enriching learning environment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dinner conversations buzzed as normal in dining halls across campus while students ate their last meals before a dining services workers’ strike set for Wednesday.
As students dined with plastic forks and disposable plates, some said they intended to eat in the dining halls as usual this week, even while HUDS workers are set to form picket lines just outside.
“I’m not making any special preparations–none of my blockmates are,” Julius B. Ross ’17 said over his meal in Adams dining hall. “We’re just planning on rolling with the punches.”
The University and Local 26, the Boston-based labor union that represents Harvard’s dining service workers, failed to reach a contract agreement Tuesday night, leading the union to announce it would strike Wednesday morning.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair wrote in an email sent to undergraduates earlier Tuesday that three upperclassman dining halls–Kirkland, Dunster, and Cabot–would close starting Wednesday for the duration of the strike. The other dining halls will extend their hours, and access to FlyBy, an alternative dining option for upperclassmen, will also be extended to freshmen.
O’Dair did not further elaborate on how dining halls will be staffed during the strike, though some Faculty Deans said the management of HUDS will largely provide meals for students. Menu options will also be modified slightly.
In the days before Local 26 announced the HUDS strike, the University started stockpiling large quantities of frozen foods in the dining halls.
Despite the uncertainty, some students said they did not feel inconvenienced by the strike.
“I’m still planning on eating in my dining hall,” Yasmin Z. Sachee ’18 said. “The majority are open, with a few exceptions, and the longer hours seem good to me.”
“I’m not sure what the strike entails for my dining options,” Obinna M. Igbokwe ’20 said. “But I didn’t do anything to prepare for it.”
Harrison H. Li ’18, whose dining hall in Kirkland House will be closed during the strike, said he was trying to keep his meal schedule normal.
“It’s a minor inconvenience, but I don’t think it’ll have a drastic impact on my day-to-day routine,” he said. “There are much worse things in life than walking an extra 50 or 100 feet to a neighboring dining hall.”
Some students, though, have contingency plans in place.
“My suitemates and I have been hoarding food like no one’s business,” Sofia Garcia ’20 said. “It’s like a little Annenberg in our room.”
She, in addition to her suitemates Claire Burch ’20 and Elizabeth D‘Haiti ’20, have taken food–cereal, fruits, and even hamburgers–back to their room in Pennypacker in backpacks and Tupperware containers, Garcia said.
She added, “The walk from Pennypacker to Annenberg is just not worth it now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A committee charged with overseeing the implementation of a new College social life policy is considering a pool of 129 undergraduate applicants and will hold a public town hall next week to discuss its work moving forward.
Fifteen undergraduates, 10 Faculty members, and nine administrators “from relevant areas in College life,” will comprise the newly-formed committee, said Music and African American Studies professor Kay K. Shelemay, the committee’s co-chair, at Tuesday’s monthly meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. She joins Douglas Melton, a Faculty Dean of Eliot House and a University professor, in leading the committee.
In May, the College announced a new policy that will penalize members of unrecognized single gender social organizations, specifically the College's Greek organizations and final clubs. Starting with the Class of 2021, the policy will bar members of these groups from receiving College-endorsed fellowships, holding leadership positions in recognized student groups, and becoming captains of varsity teams.
Last month, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana introduced the chairs of the committee and called for students to apply to join. Student applicants will be vetted by the Undergraduate Council.
The Faculty was initially slated to discuss a motion opposing the new policy at Tuesday’s meeting, but Computer Science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68—a vocal opponent of the new penalties—said miscommunications in scheduling led him to postpone the discussion.
It is unclear, however, if a Faculty vote approving the motion would override the College policy.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed its $2.5 billion capital campaign goal in June, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said at the Faculty’s monthly meeting Tuesday.
In the spring, The Crimson reported that Harvard surpassed its overall $6.5 billion fundraising goal; last month, the University announced it has raised more than $7 billion total in its fundraising drive with 18 months still on the clock.
Since the launch of the historic capital campaign in September 2013, the FAS campaign benefited from record-breaking donations from alumni. Kenneth C. Griffin '89 gave $150 million in 2014 to help fund the financial aid portion of the campaign, and hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson gave $400 million to endow his now-namesake School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in June 2015.
With strong overall fundraising, many of Harvard’s schools are focusing on fulfilling more specific fundraising priorities.
When the campaign began, administrators outlined fundraising priorities for a range of initiatives, including a revamped financial aid program, a new Allston campus for SEAS, and the renovation of undergraduate Houses. Dunster House, Leverett House’s McKinlock Hall, and Quincy House’s Stone Hall have been renovated in the past three years. Construction crews currently are working on Winthrop House, while Lowell House’s two-year renovation is set to begin next year.
House renewal, however, has taken its toll on FAS’s wallet. In part due to renovation expenses, FAS has seen a “complete depletion” of its unrestricted reserves, according to a May 2016 strategic assessment report.

Facing its first instance in history of a dining service workers strike during the academic year, Harvard announced Tuesday its plans for maintaining order in the dining halls as its workers take to the picket lines to strike for a new contract.
Addressing undergraduates in an email, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair outlined the University’s contingency plan for a strike—set to start at breakfast on Wednesday morning. According to O’Dair, Harvard’s dining halls will operate with extended meal hours, though three locations—Cabot, Dunster, and Kirkland Houses—will see suspended operations during the duration of the strike.
Harvard’s dining hall workers announced Tuesday afternoon—nearly six hours before the deadline their union set for reaching a contract settlement—that they will strike Wednesday morning, starting at 6 a.m. Workers will picket at 16 different locations around Harvard’s campus, including all of the College’s House dining halls.
With the extended hours, breakfast will run from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., lunch from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and dinner from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. Other dining hall services, like brain break and FlyBy—a grab-and-go dining service the College offers to undergraduates—will continue to be offered, though FlyBy will be expanded to include freshmen. However, Harvard students will not be able to order packaged, to-go meals, and “any packouts that have already been coordinated with a dining hall manager will be cancelled during the strike period,” according to O’Dair’s email. 
With HUDS workers absent from their posts on Wednesday, dining hall managers will primarily take the reins, the Pforzheimer and Currier House Faculty Deans wrote in emails to the students in their house. Managers are not members of the dining workers’ union.
In an email message sent to various House lists describing the “do’s” and “don’ts” of the strike, members of the Student Labor Action Movement, an undergraduate activist group, urged students to refrain from eating in cafes normally staffed by HUDS workers, as well as asked student workers in those cafes to not pick up additional shifts normally reserved for HUDS workers.
But as Harvard was preparing to offset the potentially negative effects of the union’s actions, the dining service workers were preparing their own materials for the strike. On Garden street Tuesday, the workers—and their supporters—made picket signs and acquired four RVs that the union said will serve as “mobile strike centers” during the course of the strike.
O’Dair acknowledged the effect the service disruption may have on the many students currently in the throes of midterm season.
“I know that many of you have midterm exams in addition to other commitments and are concerned about the impact of a possible strike on your schedules and dining options,” O’Dair wrote. “I urge you to prepare for tomorrow by giving yourself extra time to get your meals and to get to class.”
Tuesday morning, when the strike was still not certain, Harvard dining halls made the switch from metal utensils and ceramic dishes to plastic items. When asked about the change, HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin did not respond to requests for comment.
In the weeks leading up to strike, speculation abounded about what sort of food Harvard would serve in the absence of its regular cooks. If Harvard chose the route Yale College took when their dining workers went on strike several years ago, it may have elected to provide undergraduates with vouchers for restaurants in Harvard Square. However, nine dining workers from across the campus said they had seen unusually large quantities of frozen food being brought into the dining halls ahead of what was then a potential strike.

Heading into Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, pundits predicted a smaller viewership and relatively boring performance from Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Tim Kaine.
At Harvard, the Institute of Politics’ half-empty watch party and students’ subdued reactions to the debate showed that was the case. 
Hundreds of students turned out to watch last week’s highly anticipated first presidential debate of the cycle, with many undergraduates praising Democrat Hillary R. Clinton’s performance. But this time around, fewer groups hosted watch parties and the IOP’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum was left half-empty.
Those seats that were taken were largely filled by members of the Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club, Government concentrators, and Kennedy School students.
While both running mates—Pence, who serves as governor of Indiana, and Kaine who is a senator from Virginia—are generally considered friendlier figures than the presidential candidates at the top of either ticket, Tuesday’s debate grew heated as both candidates interrupted each other numerous times. At one point, debate moderator and CBS News anchor Elaine Quijano had to implore both candidates to let each other speak.
“Senator Kaine and Governor Pence, please,” Quijano said, prompting widespread laughter at the watch party.
In contrast to last Monday’s Trump-Clinton debate, the vice presidential debate took the form of a less formal round table format, allowing for direct dialogue—and verbal disputes. A few moments of the debate spurred particularly spirited reactions from the audience.
Early in the debate, Quijano asked Pence about Trump’s temperament and mentioned Pence’s onetime praise of his running mate as “thoughtful, compassionate, and steady” to vigorous audience laughter. The crowd reacted similarly later in the evening at Pence’s mention of Trump’s proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Conversely, much of the crowd applauded when Kaine criticized Pence’s support of Trump, saying he could not “[believe] that Governor Pence can support the insult driven campaign that Trump has run.”
“Get ‘em, Tim!” yelled a voice from the audience when Kaine lambasted Trump’s lackadaisical attitude towards nuclear proliferation.
Overall, the handful of attendees interviewed said they were impressed with both candidates’ knowledge of policy but did not believe the debate would prove consequential for either campaign.
W. Tanner Gildea ’19, communications director for the Harvard College Democrats, said that “both candidates seemed to point out policy positions” in great detail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Murphy is tired of fielding questions about the quality of his football team.
How does this year’s Crimson compare to the 2015 version (9-1, defined by a senior class with 14 All-Ivy players) or the 2014 version (10-0, defined by a last-minute win over Yale)? Can we expect another victory in The Game, another unbeaten campaign, another champagne shower?
And what of the offensive line—how was that unit reloaded? How’s the secondary? The linebacker core? Is sophomore wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley an NFL prospect?
To his credit, Murphy answers these questions—all of them—with the patience of a diplomat. But beneath this professional veneer, there must be a core of frustration. There must be a nagging internal voice that responds to every question in the same way: “What a dumb set of questions,” the voice says. “Just wait 10 weeks, and everyone will have the answers.”
Unfortunately for badgering reporters such as me, this internal voice is correct. Harvard football has played three contests against inferior opponents and won all three. Ho hum.
The known superstars (Firkser, Shelton-Mosley, and captain Sean Ahern) have played like superstars. The defense has baptized a class of new starters and recovered a portion of the dominance from last year’s unit. The offense consists of a sure-as-taxes running game and a quick-release passing game.
After three games, the Crimson is good but certainly not great. Consistent but certainly not invincible. Harvard may still evolve into a leave-no-doubt championship team, but at this stage, doubts surround the program like mist on an autumn morning. Once again, ho hum.
Let us defer, then, to the nagging internal voice. On Saturday the Crimson will face off against Cornell (3-0, 1-0 Ivy), and that game marks the start of a conference stretch that will determine the true abilities or inabilities of the 2016 Harvard team.
Until then, however, we have a rare chance to ponder larger questions. For example: Do the benefits of college football merit the violent costs?
The Crimson team provides an extraordinary window into this debate. These players are smart individuals—smart enough to take on perhaps the most high-powered college education in the world. During interviews they speak in full sentences and look you in the eye.
How perplexing it is that these Harvard students have volunteered for an activity that’s so dangerous that all participants must stuff their brains inside plastic cages.
Unqualified critics of football stop at this observation. No one can deny the physical toll of the game. Less obvious, but maybe just as insidious, is the symbolic toll: the culture of hero worship, the celebration of male aggression, and the distraction from more serious concerns. Under this logic, Crimson players are not just harming themselves; they are also harming society at large.
Yet these arguments often fail to consider the benefits of playing on a football team.
Start here: Humans are social beings; we derive innate pleasure from belonging to a collective. A football team is an especially intense example of a collective, and Harvard football is an especially intense example of a football team.
Every morning Crimson players assemble for a 6:30 a.m. lift. That kind of commitment requires enormous amounts of daily discipline. It tests personal fortitude and builds familial feeling.
The rest of football involves sacrifice, too. In one sense, the whole purpose of the game is sacrifice: to follow group orders even at the expense of personal pain. Repeatedly you make this decision, and you do so next to 10 other players who are willing to do the same.
Everyone knows that it’s noble to constrain self-interest for the sake of some positive outcome. Fewer people acknowledge that the mere act of constraining self-interest is noble. But I believe this to be true.
Football discipline may (and does) amount to points on an electronic board. But this discipline still has inherent value. It strengthens determination and underlines the importance of community. It pushes players to become men of character.
In no way should this realization acquit football. It does not negate the need for improved player protection, and it certainly does not prove that the benefits of football outweigh the costs. But when considering the question of football, one must acknowledge the essential dignity of the game along with the essential violence.
There’s a reason that so many players leave the sport, rightfully angered by the cruelty and danger. But there’s also a reason that so many stick around, choosing to wake up at 6:30 a.m. just so they can work hard—again and again and again.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Attendance was officially listed at 7,138 for Harvard’s non-conference bout with Georgetown this past Friday, but a quick glance around the stadium would make that figure hard to believe.
Not too many fans ventured into the cold and rain to witness the Crimson’s 31-17 victory over the Hoyas. Appropriately, it may prove to be one of the more forgettable games of the season.
Three starters who were listed as questionable—senior offensive lineman Max Rich, his junior O-line counterpart DJ Mott, and sophomore wideout Justice Shelton-Mosley—got the week off.
With a win despite the absences of several key players in this game, it is clear that Harvard has a substantial amount of depth at most positions. It seems as though the Crimson is well-equipped to handle the potential loss of starters on both sides of the ball moving forward.
“We’ve had probably an inordinate amount of injuries so far this year, but we’ve done a good job finding guys that can step up and play,” Murphy said.
TRIPLE-BARREL SHOTGUN
When Harvard jumped out to a 21-7 lead early in the second quarter, senior quarterback Joe Viviano’s day came to an early end. Murphy elected to give his starter some rest ahead of the Crimson’s remaining Ivy League slate, and in the process he got an extended look at two of his backups in game action.
After Viviano’s third touchdown, one that saw senior halfback/tight end Anthony Firkser find a gap in the Georgetown secondary and sprint 75 yards to the end zone, Murphy decided to go with sophomore quarterback Tom Stewart on the ensuing drive.
Stewart steered the offense for much of the second quarter and half of the third. He threw for 111 yards, but only hit his receivers on seven of 13 pass attempts.
The Dallas, Texas, native was intercepted twice, and both were picked off in the end zone as Harvard threatened to score.
Following Stewart, Murphy decided to go with another sophomore, Cam Tripp. Tripp was also intercepted once and lost a fumble, but he led a fourth quarter drive that resulted in a touchdown to extend the Crimson’s lead to 31-7.
Facing a third and goal at the 10, Tripp evaded the rush and scrambled right, throwing a strike to freshman wide receiver Cody Chrest in the back of the end zone.
After Viviano exited the game, Harvard’s offense seemed to stall, only managing to score 10 more points the rest of the way. The unfamiliarity of the two sophomore field generals was the most probable culprit.
“We need to get everybody reps, and we probably were a little bit ambitious in terms of throwing guys in too soon,” Murphy said. “Plenty to clean up, but at the end of the day we did some things really well.”
HOYA SACKS-A
Through three games, sophomore defensive end DJ Bailey has burst onto the scene for the Crimson.
The San Juan Capistrano, Calif., native recorded three tackles in four games his freshman year. This season, Bailey has seen increased playing time and has increased his production in the process. He has 12 total tackles and three and a half sacks.
On one play in the third quarter, Bailey broke to the outside around the Hoyas’ sophomore right tackle Micah Smith. Bailey exploded past Smith, closed the gap to sophomore quarterback Clay Norris, and sacked him for a loss of six yards.
This was one of two sacks on the day for Bailey. The other set Georgetown back five yards, and Bailey added another tackle to bring his season total to 12.
Along with Bailey, the rest of the defense played a key role in the outcome. After Viviano’s departure, Harvard kept the Hoyas at bay, surrendering only 10 more points the rest of the way to match the 10 that the Crimson tallied.
Georgetown only converted one of 13 third downs and finished with just nine first downs after four quarters of play.
“Harvard’s pretty good up front,” Georgetown coach Rob Sgarlata said. “There was definitely a difference between their defensive line and our offensive line, so we struggled a little bit on third down.”
FUMBLES IN THE FORECAST
If there is one thing that Murphy prioritizes when it comes to his offense, it is ball security.
So, when the forecast for Friday called for rain, Harvard’s veteran coach of 23 seasons decided to adapt his game plan to the elements.
“The elements will dictate to some extent what goes on, and I think the team that best adapts to the elements is probably going to win,” Murphy said before the game.
With rain coming down fairly heavily before and during the game, Murphy seemed to rely more on the Crimson’s aerial attack than its ground game to advance the ball downfield.
In the previous week’s matchup against Brown, Harvard ran 74 total offensive plays, 43 of which were rushing attempts. The Crimson rushed 49 times against the Hoyas but had 92 total snaps on offense.
Harvard was intercepted three times on offense and also lost two fumbles. Georgetown was only intercepted once, and the Crimson’s defense was unable to force a fumble.
Harvard managed to limit the damage from these turnovers, and none proved costly as the Crimson rolled to a two-touchdown margin of victory.
Going forward, it will be interesting to note if Murphy further alters the offense in any way when Harvard faces tough defensive teams like Penn and Dartmouth.
Murphy’s prediction was not necessarily true, as the rain seemed to affect the Crimson’s offense more than it did the Hoyas’. However, the slipups occurred when Harvard already held a sizeable lead, and Georgetown failed to mount a comeback.
