After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the time the first modern Broadway musical had its premiere in 1866, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals had already produced more than 20 shows. And the troop has not slowed down since. “Victorian Secrets,” the Pudding’s 166th production, is running at Farkas Hall through March 9. The Crimson sat down with composer Dylan MarcAurele ’16, writer Brian J. Mendel ’15, and actor Ethan D. Hardy ’14 to get an idea of what went into the making of the latest iteration of a time-honored spectacle.
 
The Harvard Crimson: What are your favorite memories from the rehearsal process or the show’s run?
 
Ethan Hardy: As a cast member, the 12 of us spend a tremendous amount of time together. It’s kind of ridiculous. We spend hundreds of hours total with each other. We do the show 38 times…and the weeks of [rehearsals] prior to that run 12 hours a day. There’s a lot of togetherness that develops over that.
 
Brian Mendel: There have been a lot of moments that have been very cool from a writer’s perspective…. When we saw the sketches for the set design…[was] when it all became real. And then the first read-through, and seeing everyone in their costumes for the first time…. It’s been really cool to have something come out of nothing and become this huge production with all of these very talented people.
 
THC: What is your favorite number in the show?
 
Dylan MarcAurele: “Bustin’ Out” gets the best reaction. It’s Ethan’s big gospel number, in which Sharon Secrets, the poor missionary girl, proclaims that she’s going to leave the church and sort of become a slut. In a punnier way.
 
THC: How do you deal with the heels?
 
EH: We get pretty good at them…. It’s all about just developing those leg muscles…. I can’t speak for [the whole] cast, but I’m actually quite fond of heels now. I think they’re pretty fun to wear, and I think it helps you get into character.
 
THC: What are the particular challenges of performing in a Hasty Pudding show?
 
EH: It’s definitely a throwback style. It’s very vaudevillian…. Our director, Tony Parise, who’s been working with us for 25 years or so, describes it as a combination of vaudeville and Shakespeare….It is a very performative, very physical style of acting…. We’re not doing method work here, where we’re sitting in a room looking into each other’s eyes…. It’s all about standing up straight and directing your focus to the characters that are speaking, and making sure you’re essentially being a puppet master to your costume, which is enormous and elaborate and heavy and cumbersome and beautiful…. It’s much more antique than a lot of theater that goes on at Harvard because it’s such a…show.
 
THC: What makes this year’s show unique?
 
EH: I think the production values this year are really superb. I think they’re basically on par with a lot of professional productions. Across the board: the set design, the scenery. The costumes are stellar and gorgeous. The use of the stage…it’s definitely been a step up this year. As a purely visual spectacle, it’s really very spectacular to see.
 
THC: How did you balance honoring the traditional style of the Hasty Pudding with incorporating your own style?
 
BM: Usually the people who write the show were involved with the company at some point…so we sort of had our own unique perspective on what to put into the show. I feel like we haven’t had as many puns this year.
 
DM: For me it’s been a learning process, learning to write in the style of the Pudding. But…it’s hard to articulate why it’s different.
 
EH: I think part of the fun in creating it is in seeing how you would interpret these traditions…. There are so many people involved too, and we do work with professionals. There’s so many hands going in, and voices…. It ends up being a sort of baby reared by a village.
 
THC: How did you come up with idea for the script?
 
 
 
BM: You think of a setting first, [and] we settled on Victorian England. We had this running joke that in past Pudding shows there’s one character who’s a prostitute or something of that ilk, and they always come to the front of the stage and say their joke about their craft and then walk back to the back of the stage, and we thought, what if we had twelve characters like that, and we set it in a brothel, and called it “O Brothel, Where Art Thou,” and that’s one of titles of the songs…. From there we just thought, in Victorian England who would be there?…. I don’t know how we came up with the plot…but the idea of these weird characters sort of led [to it]. Like we [thought of] a professor [named] Hannibal Lecture and we thought we should probably have someone get murdered.
 
THC: What is your favorite moment for your character?
 
EH: I play Sharon Secrets, who is a missionary who returns to England to find her brother so that she can claim her half of the inheritance because she’s decided to leave the church in pursuit of, romance, we’ll say. I’ve had an absolute blast playing her. My favorite moments in general with her are interacting with my brother in the show, who’s named Baron Wasteland. Obviously in our family, the family line is made by the rhyming first name and not the same last name. It’s a lot of fun simulating this brother-sister conflict.
 
DM: They get really close together and just breathe on each other
 
EH: There are so many intangible things that I end up loving in the show. It’s a cast of 12, and it’s a pretty ensemble cast. We don’t have a chorus, so everyone is a main character, and there’s little things that everyone does that I think are so funny. And when we’re all on stage together, it’s amazing that we can keep it together, and sometimes we can’t because someone will say a line differently or look at someone a different way…. There’s nothing I don’t like.
 
THC: Describe the show in one word.
 
BM: Bizarre.
 
EH: Zany, but with like three zees…wherever you want to put the zees.
 
DM: Sexy. With a zee, also. It’ll have some sizzle.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students had the chance to taste Italian cuisine based on the recipes of an award-winning chef at dinner on Friday.
As a part of the Harvard University Dining Services’ series Women in Food, intended to expose students to food created by famous female chefs, all 13 dining halls featured dishes from Jody Adams, owner of the restaurant Rialto located in the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square. 
Adams received the James Beard Foundation award for The Perrier-Jouet Best Chef in 1997 and appeared as a competitor on the television series Top Chef Masters in 2009.
She also has prior experience collaborating with Harvard, having served on the HUDS advisory board for many years.
“I have a familiar relationship with the dining services and all the folks there,” Adams said. “I have been in almost every dining hall on campus.” 
In fact, Adams was present in Annenberg and Currier House dining hall on Friday, talking to students about how they enjoyed their food. 
“She seem really interested in making sure that we had a good experience, but also that we had a healthy experience at the same time,” Divya Seth ’14 said.
Adam’s recipes featured on Friday’s special menu included roast chicken, fiery garlicky greens, and braised cod with fennel, orange, saffron, and pistachio gremolata.
After eating, students were asked to provide feedback for a chance to win a $250 certificate to Rialto.
 
Some students interviewed by The Crimson said they had a positive reaction to Friday’s dinner.
“I thought the food was pretty good overall,”  Annalee C. Perez ’17 said. “The seasoning on the chicken was pretty delicious.”
Others said they did not notice a difference from typical HUDS fare.
“I didn’t know about what was going on today,” Vivek Jayaram ’17 said. “As a whole, I didn’t enjoy the food no more than normal, although the potatoes today were juicy and firm and the spices complimented it excellently to create a sensation of flavor in the mouth.”
Adams said she hopes that the series would inspire more students to visit the restaurant themselves.
“I want [the students] to fall in love with my food and come to Rialto and enjoy the experience here, either in the dining room by themselves or their family, or come into the bar,” Adams said. “We have wonderful small plates and we have a really accessibly-priced menu here for them.”
Some students said that Friday’s menu might help encourage them to dine at the restaurant one day.
“I actually made multiple plans to go visit Rialto, and they had always fallen through,” said Lucy Q. Zhong ’14. “But I think that this is a good catalyst for me to go, especially if the prices are affordable.” 
Previous chefs in the series include Diane Kochilas, who presented her Greek and Mediterranean-style cooking, and Mai Pham, who showcased her Vietnamese cuisine. The Women in Food series is ongoing, though upcoming guest chefs have not yet been announced.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: March 2, 2014, at 7:47 p.m.
While most Harvard students graduate with a degree in the concentration they initially declared sophomore year, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology concentrators are poised to have a different experience.
 
The concentration, known as OEB for short, will be renamed Integrative Biology, according to an email announcement sent to concentrators Thursday. 
 
“We feel that IB better represents our undergraduate curriculum and experience,” wrote OEB concentration advisor Andrew Berry in the emailed statement. 
Formed six years ago when the science departments at Harvard reorganized into the nine concentrations that now make up the Life Sciences cluster, Organismic and Evolutionary Biology is known for its all-encompassing and interdisciplinary approach to the study of the life sciences. The Life Sciences website said the OEB concentration has been designed with an appreciation of the need for both learning in breadth and learning in depth.
While the name of OEB concentration will change, the department will continue to go by the name OEB and the requirements and courses will not change. Seniors graduating this spring will have the option of either title on their diploma, according to James D. Carey ’14.
“I don’t have a strong preference either way,” Carey said. “I think I’d opt for IB just so it’s easier for people down the line to understand.”
 
Berry listed three chief reasons behind the department’s change in his email to the concentration. Primarily, “the word ‘integrative’ emphasizes the breadth of research approaches and systems of study embodied in the course offerings of our concentration, as well as the flexible nature of our concentration requirements,” he wrote.
 
In addition, the new name is designed to be less daunting to potential concentrators deciding between several related life sciences concentrations. 
“I think it better encompasses the material in the concentration,” said Andrew D. Clark ’16, who declared OEB as his concentration last fall. “Also, it’s definitely less of a mouthful to say.”
 
Finally, Berry cited a desire to engage more students who may not want to specialize in specific systems or types of biology upon declaring their concentration.
 
“I think the rationale is to make it more inclusive,” Carey said. “One of the strengths of the concentration is its flexibility and variety of academic offerings, and making this more clear would help convey this to prospective concentrators.”

UPDATED: March 2, 2014, at 11:20 p.m.
The Harvard Medical Student Review—a new, online student-run and peer-reviewed medical journal—will launch Monday under the leadership of Harvard Medical School, Harvard Dental School, and students and staff from the Harvard School of Public Health. 
The founders of the Review include Medical School students Noor M. R. Beckwith ’11, Omar Abudayyeh, and Jay Kumar and Medical School teaching assistant Adam Frange. The founders said that the review will provide a forum for students to discuss current issues in health and medicine.
Abudayyeh, a second-year student at the Medical School, said that there “are such vibrant debates in the halls of our school with no outlet for students to express them.”
The journal aims to provide a platform for students’ ideas, said Kumar, a second-year student at the Medical School. 
The Review’s content will include narratives, reflections on medical school and patient experiences, paintings, case reports, and articles on research and global health initiatives.
“In medicine, writing has not been encouraged as formally,” said Beckwith, a second-year student at the Medical School. “The journal provides a new space to make writing a larger part of the student experience.”
The founders said that they discovered that the Harvard administration was supportive of their efforts to launch the journal.
“This journal will allow the world to know what the next generation of physician and physician scientists are talking about,” Nancy E. Oriol, the Medical School Dean for Students and a member of the Review's advisory board, wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson.
Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier expressed his support for the journal in an e-mail to The Crimson.
“I am continually impressed by the initiative shown by our HMS students,” he wrote. “They are seeking to make a difference in medicine.”
The journal aims to facilitate dialogue between communities at Harvard, affiliated hospitals, and surrounding academic institutions such as the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences and the Simmons College of Nursing.
The journal allows for submissions from different graduate schools in a variety of formats, including scholarly articles, editorials, poetry, and art.
The Review’s elaborate editing process is based on Harvard Medicine magazine and an automated editing system inspired by the Harvard Law Review, according to Frange.
The journal’s founders said that they hope that the launch of the Review will inspire similar student-run, peer-reviewed journals at other universities.
“The work published and the editorial choices made by the students will offer a window into who they are and what matters to them,” Oriol said.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: March 2, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified one of the schools that will oversee the Harvard Medical Student Review. In fact, the Dental School will join the Medical School and the School of Public Health in overseeing the publication. The article also incorrectly stated the number of years two of the founders of the Harvard Medical Student Review have studied at the Medical School. In fact, both Noor M.R. Beckwith and Jay Kumar are second-year students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Harvard Square welcomed the parents and families of the Class of 2015 for Junior Parents Weekend last Friday, it lacked one mainstay option for accommodations near campus, the Inn at Harvard.
The Inn at Harvard closed its doors last July for renovations in order to transform the building into swing housing for displaced Dunster residents next year while the House is under construction.
Angel Ovalle, the front office manager at the Hotel Veritas, said that the hotel has seen a growth in overall bookings since the Inn at Harvard closed.
“Any Harvard-related event is important to us. We try to keep track of events going on at Harvard,” he said, adding that the hotel strives to maintain a close relationship with the Harvard community.
Michael Guleserian, the general manager of the Sheraton Commander, said that the closure of the Inn at Harvard likely sparked an increase in room requests at hotels that are farther away from campus.
“I’m sure that the hotels that are outside of the Square might feel a little bit more, but it’s a time of year that we’re busy anyway, so we’re going to feel the same demand that we did last year,” he said.
Ariana Ducas, the PR and marketing Coordinator for the Charles Hotel, said that the Charles did see a rise in room inquiries this year.
“We’ve noticed a slight increase in the number of people requesting rooms for this weekend, but we can’t be sure if it’s due to the closure of the Inn at Harvard,” she wrote in an email.
Though the Hotel Veritas does not offer a discount specifically for Junior Parents Weekend, parents of Harvard students are given the hotel’s 15 percent discount for being part of the Harvard community.
Guleserian said that some parents book hotel rooms a year in advance of Junior Parents Weekend—the same time frame parents typically use to make plans for Commencement, as well. Ducas also explained that families reserve rooms at the Charles up to a year before the actual weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
UPDATED: March 3, 2014, at 1:00 a.m.
The Undergraduate Council passed legislation relating to a labor dispute between workers and DoubleTree Suites, gender-neutral housing, and the transparency of the UC budget during its general meeting on Sunday.
During the meeting, members from the Student Labor Action Movement group and workers from DoubleTree Suites asked the Council to openly support future efforts to create better working conditions. Although Harvard owns the DoubleTree building, Hilton Hotel Boston runs and manages day-to-day operations.
 
According to undergraduates from SLAM, DoubleTree workers are planning to boycott the business in an attempt to affect change.
 
The legislation presented asked the Council to inform UC grant recipients that it would support a boycott and to pressure administrators to support the workers’ requests. The proposal also requested that the UC send a mass email to undergraduates asking them to stop patronizing the hotel if Harvard does not publicly support the demands of the workers by April 1.
 
UC representatives were not immediately sure whether they had enough information to hand down a decision on the labor dispute or whether it was even within their purview to support the measure.
 
According to SLAM member Gabriel H. Bayard ’15, University President Drew G. Faust has denied that Harvard has any ties to the management of the hotel. Bayard, however, said he disagreed. 
“We know that Harvard has a deep relationship with the DoubleTree hotel,” Bayard said after the meeting.
 
After an extended question and answer period, followed by an open debate, the UC eventually called the question to vote. The Council added an amendment insisting that the UC would only support a boycott if the majority of DoubleTree workers do so as well. A second amendment clarified language pertaining to the goals of the workers.
 
Both amendments passed with broad support.
 
The deliberations, however, prompted disagreement among Council members. Cabot Representative Tyler W. Creamer '16, an inactive Crimson business editor who voted against the measure, said after the meeting that the labor issue is not under the jurisdiction of the UC, though he supports the workers and feels they might deserve more compensation.
 
“The UC’s purview is mostly to focus on student issues, and I don’t think this counts as a student issue,” Creamer said. 
Quinn D. Hatoff  ’15, an inactive Crimson news editor and Kirkland House representative, also urged members to endorse a proposal that would make gender-neutral housing more accessible.
 
“Our task as a Council is to ensure that all undergraduates—regardless of the actions of the housing gods—have equal access to their preferred living arrangements,” Hatoff said.
The measure, which passed with overwhelming support, calls on the Office of Student Life to simplify the process of applying for gender neutral housing. It also requires the President of the UC to send a mass email to students showing the body’s support of the efforts and mandates that members “continue communication with the leaders of the movement.”
 
The UC later passed the “Financial Transparency Act,” which specifically outlines the Council’s budget and lists procedures for reporting expenses.
 
Representatives also approved another spring grants pack, which will allocate around $40,000 to various club sport groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first game of co-captain Laurent Rivard’s career was one to forget. The then-freshman starter hoisted 11 shots in a 66-53 loss to George Mason, making none. Starting because of his ability to space the floor, the three-point shooter missed all seven attempts from beyond the arc.
It didn’t take long for Rivard and his team to find their footing. In his sixth game as a rookie, Rivard scored 21 points in 20 minutes. That sparked a run of six double-digit efforts in seven contests as the Harvard men’s basketball team won 15 of 17 games after the George Mason loss. The season ended with a share of the Ivy League championship, Harvard’s first ever.
With each coming season, Harvard and Rivard continued taking steps forward. In his sophomore year, Harvard made it to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1946, and Rivard led the Crimson with 20 points in a first-round loss to Vanderbilt. A season later, the then-junior had 17 points as 14th-seeded Harvard advanced to the round of 32, winning its second-round game over New Mexico, 68-62.
“Coach [Tommy Amaker] talked about winning championships when he was recruiting us,” Rivard said. “We have always wanted more and weren’t satisfied with just a share…. Coach has done a great job of keeping us hungry.”
On Saturday night, Rivard and his squad made it four-for-four as the Crimson (24-4, 11-1 Ivy) became the first team since Penn in the mid-90’s to clinch at least a share of four straight league titles. The co-captain nabbed a game-high 21 points in his squad’s 80-47 victory over Columbia (18-11, 7-5). With his six threes on the night, Rivard moved into a tie for third in Ancient Eight history.
“If you could write a script, this is one you would write,” Amaker said. “It doesn’t always happen that way, but how wonderful and cool it is to see it and be a part of it, and [see] the growth and the journey we have been on culminate in a moment like this tonight.”
Harvard jumped on Columbia early and often. The Crimson scored the first eight points of the game, and a fast break layup by sophomore guard Siyani Chambers put the Crimson up, 22-4, with 10 minutes left in the first half. At that point in the contest, Columbia had twice as many turnovers as points. Lion junior Alex Rosenberg, who had 31 points on just seven shots the night before against Dartmouth, missed his first four shots from the field and finished the half with only four points.
However, behind inspired play from reserve Jeff Coby—who tallied 11 first-half points—Columbia cut the deficit to 10 early in the second period on a layup by sophomore point guard Maodo Lo.
Harvard had the response, rattling off a 29-12 run that ended with a Rivard four-point play. The co-captain had 13 points and a rare block in the spurt, rattling in four threes in an 11-minute span.
“It’s Laurent, it’s what he does,” junior wing Wesley Saunders said. “He’s one of, if not the best, shooters I’ve ever seen.”
On the defensive end, Harvard fixed many of the problems that had allowed Columbia to post 84 points—shooting 48 percent—in the teams’ last meeting. After Rosenberg burned Rivard for 34 points in mid-February, Amaker began the game with versatile senior forward Kyle Casey on the Columbia junior. Rosenberg finished the game just 1-of-7 from the floor with three turnovers.
As a team, Columbia shot only 25 percent from the field in the second half and 34 percent for the game. The Crimson turned 14 Lion turnovers into 21 points, holding its opponent under 50 points for the fourth time in five games.
“There was a passion and a hunger for our team to play our man-to-man defense,” Amaker said. “We helped extremely well and were active. We forced those turnovers, and take a lot of pride in creating offense from our defense.”
On its seniors’ last weekend at Lavietes Pavilion, Harvard outscored its counterparts by a combined 58 points. The Crimson finished the game shooting 60 percent from the field, 62 percent from the three-point line, and 90 percent from the line—its best shooting performance of the season. Paced by juniors Steve-Moundou Missi (16 points) and Saunders (10 points, seven rebounds, seven assists), Harvard missed just nine shots in the second half.
“I think the vision that Coach Amaker had for the program and what we saw in the program has really all come together,” Saunders said. “We are seeing all the hard work that we have put in and [accomplishments] we worked so hard for, and it’s a great feeling to finally be able to celebrate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The seniors on the Harvard men’s basketball team (24-4, 11-1 Ivy) took to the floor at Lavietes Pavilion for the last time Saturday night, but they asserted their ownership of the gym before they left.
Although Senior Night came Friday against Cornell, Saturday’s game against Columbia (18-11, 7-5) marked the last home game for five Harvard players.
They went out with a bang.
For co-captain Laurent Rivard, it was more of a swoosh. Rivard led all scorers with 21 points, going 6-of-8 from three-point range in his second-highest point total of the year.
At one point, Rivard connected on five threes in a row. And, in his final shot at Lavietes, the Harvard co-captain was fouled as he hit from long range, converting the four-point play just moments later.
“I was just happy, loving it,” Rivard said. “I knew it was my last half of basketball [at Lavietes]. Brandyn called that play and I knew it was set up for me to hit a shot. I was ready and he made a great pass.”
Senior Kyle Casey proved he could electrify the crowd as well. In the opening minutes of the game, the senior took a pass from junior Wesley Saunders, planted two feet in the paint, and propelled himself high into the air to throw down a slam that brought the crowd to its feet.
Casey added two more dunks on the night, although neither was as worthy of a SportsCenter top-10 nomination as the first. His efficient 10 points (on seven shots) and four rebounds helped the Crimson control the paint against the lengthy Lions throughout the night.
It wasn’t just Rivard and Casey who made big plays, though. Although co-captain Brandyn Curry followed up his 12-point performance against the Big Red with just five points Saturday night, his three-pointer midway through the second half capped a 16-4 Crimson run that essentially put the game out of reach.
Senior Dee Giger—who saw the floor for just two minutes Saturday—caused the Crimson bench to jump up and down by hitting a deep three late in the closing moments of the game. The final senior, Tom Hamel, was out for the game with injury.
“[The seniors] have been sensational for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They have believed and have trusted, and they really love the system and style that we have. I think that they have bought into that wholeheartedly, and you see that in how they play.”
STRONG OUT OF THE GATES
Last time out against the Lions, it would take two overtime periods for Harvard to prevail. On Saturday night, the Crimson demonstrated early on this game would be different.
Harvard rode efficient offense and assertive defense to seize a commanding lead in the opening minutes of the contest. Junior Steve Moundou-Missi contributed eight of the Crimson’s initial 12 points as the Crimson took a 17-2 advantage after just seven minutes of play.
“We just came out ready,” Saunders said. “I think we came out with a lot of energy. It was a big game for us and we came out like it.”
The Lions did not get on the board until nearly five minutes had elapsed in the half. The margin increased to 20 just five minutes thereafter.
Harvard’s active defensive presence forced the Lions to settle for bad shots and led to fast break opportunities on the offensive end. After just ten minutes of play, Columbia had committed eight turnovers to the Crimson’s three.
Harvard shot 55 percent from the field in the first half, led by 10 points from Moundou-Missi. The Crimson also benefited from 15-of-17 shooting at the free throw line in the first 20 minutes.
ROSENBERG ON THE ROPES
When Harvard and Columbia last met two weekends ago in New York, junior Alex Rosenberg dropped 34 points and nearly walked off with a game-winning jumper. Friday night against Dartmouth, the junior contributed 31 points and missed just one shot.
What answer did Harvard have for Rosenberg? Enter Kyle Casey.
The senior marked Rosenberg for the majority of the first half and made him uncomfortable from the outset. Rosenberg missed his first four shots and often settled for three-point attempts instead of taking Casey to the basket.
At the end of the night, Rosenberg had ten points on just 1-of-7 shooting – his lowest field goal total on the year in games where he played at least 20 minutes.
“With Kyle being one of our veteran guys, that was the matchup we thought was best,” Amaker said. “He wanted that challenge… but it wasn’t going to be one person or one guy. We had to do that as a team.”

After a weekend away from home, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (8-4, 6-1 EIVA) returned to Cambridge to continue conference play in the friendly confines of the Malkin Athletic Center against Rutgers-Newark and NJIT, the two bottom-dwellers of the league.
With a pair of all-around efforts, the Crimson picked up straight-set victories over both NJIT (0-5, 5-6) and Rutgers-Newark (0-5, 4-7) to maintain its one-loss conference record and post its best seven game EIVA start in Harvard history.
The two victories, along with a Penn State loss on Friday to Princeton, propelled Harvard to a tie at the top of the standings halfway through the conference schedule.
HARVARD 3, NJIT 0
The Crimson rode a balanced attack on Saturday night to a 25-16, 25-19, and 25-14 straight-set win, the team’s third consecutive victory.
Harvard took advantage of consistent offensive production from brothers DJ and Casey White, who led the Crimson with a combined 29 kills. The Crimson finished with a .442 kill percentage and a .441 hit percentage, marking the team’s highest output of the season.
“Our offense was flowing really well, [and] our outside [hitters were] hitting really well,” co-captain Nick Madden said. “Our offensive hitting and service was really good. We had some great serving runs.”
Harvard seized an early lead in the contest by claiming the first set with a .577 hitting percentage that helped turn a 9-5 lead into a 13-5 margin. The advantage would never drop below six points.
The second set witnessed a more competitive game, as the Crimson men struggled to distance themselves. But a Madden kill sparked a 3-0 run that put Harvard up 18-14, a lead which the home team would never relinquish.
While the beginning of the third set followed a similar script, a kill by DJ White initiated a 6-0 run that made the score 19-11. The Crimson would seal the victory moments later.
The team coupled its offensive output with a solid defensive performance, registering 16 blocks to their opponents’ five while collecting 47 digs to just 23 by the Highlanders. Despite the convincing display, Harvard coach Brian Baise felt the team still had room for improvement.
“We’re doing a pretty good job blocking,” Baise said. “But if the ball gets by our block, I’d like to get more of those balls up. Our backcourt defense is something we’ll be working on this week.”
HARVARD 3, RUTGERS-NEWARK 0
The Crimson men started their weekend homestand with a victory over Rutgers-Newark on Friday night, as Harvard cruised to a swift 25-19, 25-15, and 25-14 straight-set victory.
The Crimson benefited from a big individual performance from senior middle blocker Will Chambers, who posted nine kills with a .727 hitting percentage. Classmate and fellow middle blocker Kyle Rehkemper also contributed six kills with a .857 percentage.
Overall, the balanced night saw nine different players record a point during the game.
“We didn’t make the errors, and we gave the other team the chance to make the errors,” Baise said. “We were good fundamentally. Our passing and our defense were good, and mentally it was a really good match for us.”
A tight first set swung in Harvard’s favor after a kill from sophomore outside hitter Branden Clemens began a 4-0 run that put the Crimson up 24-18. A service error by the Scarlet Knights closed out the set.
Harvard came out strong in the second set and controlled the tempo from the start. Another Clemens kill started a 6-0 run for the team, and Rutgers-Newark never reduced the gap to less than five.
The third set resembled the second in form, with Harvard taking advantage of an early 4-0 run to go up 6-1. Two more 5-0 runs later in the set allowed Harvard to cruise to a comfortable 11-point victory in the final game.
“It was a test of focus for sure,” Madden said. “There are teams in our league that we have to beat that just take focus. I think in any game [like that] you’re getting reps, you’re working on shots you wouldn’t try versus other teams. I think ultimately it’s a test of focus and willpower.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s lacrosse team (1-2) fell short against a powerful University of Albany (1-2) offense on Saturday afternoon in Albany, N.Y. as two brothers combined for more goals than the entire Crimson roster.
In last year’s match against Harvard, Great Dane attackmen Lyle and Miles Thompson scored four and three goals, respectively, propelling their team to an easy victory. This year, the duo along with fellow Albany attackman and cousin Ty Thompson, are each individually regarded as potential Tewaaraton trophy candidates and reside on the watch list for the prestigious award.
“[The Thompsons] are great players,” said Harvard coach Chris Wojcik ’96. “[Lyle and Miles] are two of the top players in the country hands down. They have a unique skillset and do things where you play great defense and they still score. They are a really difficult matchup.”
Unfortunately for the Crimson, Lyle and Miles Thompson demonstrated why they are receiving such a high degree of national attention on Saturday, notching a collective 12 goals en route to a 14-8 victory over Harvard.
“We played defense the way we want to play defense,” Wojcik said. “They just kept us on our heels the whole game.”
The Crimson began the contest by notching two relatively quick goals, with the scoring coming from senior midfielder Brian O’Toole and sophomore midfielder Sean McDonagh.
But it was not long before Miles answered, scoring twice before the first quarter endded, and then twice more right after the second period began.
Harvard responded quickly, however, as sophomore attackman Will Walker took a pass from McDonagh and scored just 45 seconds after Miles’ fourth goal with 12 minutes left in the first half. Sophomore midfielder Brendan Newman then found the back of the net three minutes later, tying the score at 4-4 midway through the second quarter.
“Something positive that we can take away from this game is that we are very tough on the ground,” said captain and defenseman Joe Petrucci. “That’s passion and determination and having the fight to stay in the game.”
But from there, it was all about the Thompsons.
First, Lyle scored on a man-up opportunity assisted by Miles with 7:39 left in the half. Two minutes later, Lyle scored unassisted. And after another Harvard penalty, Miles converted with the assist coming from Lyle to close out the half with a 7-4 lead for Albany.
The Thompson show continued just one minute into the second half, as Miles scored and Ty notched a goal assisted by Lyle.
The Crimson attempted to fight back, as Newman converted his second goal of the afternoon. Senior attackman Carl Zimmerman also scored to close out the third quarter, but it would be too little, too late.
Miles and Lyle each scored two more goals in the fourth quarter, bringing their respective tallies to eight and four on the day. Adam Osika also came through to record the only non-Thompson Albany goal in the game.
On the Harvard side, Walker scored his second goal on a man-up opportunity, and captain Peter Schwartz added another before the game could end.
Despite being outplayed by a superior offense, the Crimson still managed to perform in certain aspects of the game. Harvard lost the faceoff battle for the third game in a row, but the team came out on top in the ground ball game, 23-20.
“We played hard between the lines,” Wojcik said. “We didn’t give up transition goals, and we really fought for ground balls. That helped keep us in the game.”
But Harvard struggled to execute offensively, only finding the net with eight of its 43 shots.
“We got outplayed,” Wojcik said. “The beat us particularly on faceoffs, but it really came down to their offense executing better than ours. We played hard, and winning the ground ball battle was big, but our offense was not as sharp as theirs.”
The Crimson failed to stop the Great Dane attackmen throughout the match and gave up a number of penalties as a result. Starting defensemen Robert Duvnjak and Petrucci were each charged with three penalties, and Albany was given eight man-up chances in all to Harvard’s six. The Crimson also failed to capitalize on the first five of these opportunities, whereas Albany went 3-of-8.
“We just got outplayed on both ends of the field,” Petrucci said. “We didn’t support our guys when we needed to, and they have some great players. We need to play better team defense and we will going forward.… The mistakes that we made were correctable, and I think we all like the position that we are in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a one-year hiatus on the men’s side, both the Ramsay and Pool Cups are coming back to Harvard in 2014.
Junior Amanda Sobhy defeated Trinity’s Kanzy El Defrawy in three games for the second consecutive year to capture her third straight national title on the women’s side, while senior Ali Farag avenged last year’s semifinal loss to St. Lawrence’s Amr Khaled Khalifa with a 3-1 win in the finals.
The Ramsay Cup win was just another part of a remarkable year for Sobhy, who finished the season with a perfect 17-0 record. No collegiate player was able to take a single game from the Harvard junior, who is the first player in program history to win the Ramsay Cup three times.
“It feels really good [to win a third time],” Sobhy said. “I’m just pumped to play well. There’s always the pressure of being the number one seed but I try to not let that get to me. I just try to play well. Winning it three times in a row is really great, and hopefully I’ll win a fourth next year, too.”
The finals marked the third time that Sobhy had faced El Defrawy this year, with the last occurring at the No. 1 position in the team finals. Sobhy easily dispatched the Trinity sophomore in the two previous instances, and the pattern continued on Sunday. Sobhy swept El Defrawy with scores of 11-6, 11-5, and 11-3.
“[El Defrawy] and I…both know [each other’s] games pretty well,” Sobhy said. “She’s a very feisty player, very talented, so I always have to make sure that I come out strong from the beginning because once she gets the momentum she can be really, really good. There’s always that little bit of nerves from the beginning playing her, but I think after I settled [in] I played very well.”
Farag followed up with a slightly more dramatic win an hour later. A year after Khalifa upset Farag in five games in the semifinals, the sophomore opened up this season’s national title defense with an 11-6 win over Farag in the first game.
Farag appeared to be in trouble when Khalifa proceeded to take a 6-2 lead in the second game, but the Harvard senior won the next four points to tie up the game, 6-all. The two battled back-and-forth to send the game to tiebreakers, where Farag managed to come away with a 13-11 win, knotting up the match at one game apiece.
After winning the second game, Farag took control of the championship match. The senior pulled away in the third game to take a one game lead before defeating Khalifa, 11-4, in the final frame, notching the Pool Cup victory.
“I knew it was going to be a tough match today because we’ve grown up playing against each other,” Farag said. “I’ve been thinking about this match for a year, so I didn’t want to put pressure on myself, but I was happy with the way I played today and obviously I’m happy with the result.”
The senior also received the 2014 Skillman Award—given to a player who has demonstrated outstanding sportsmanship throughout his career—at the championships this weekend. Farag finished his final collegiate year with two national championships, as his team won Harvard’s 31st men’s squash title two weeks ago.
“I’ve been looking for this for two years now,” Farag said. “Ever since I was a sophomore, I’ve been waiting for this moment to win both the team and the individual championships at the same time. I think the team, along with the captains and the coaches, has a job to be able to pull out the wins, and I think [we’ve] succeeded.”
The Harvard squash program sent four other players to the individual championships this weekend. Junior co-captain Haley Mendez represented Harvard on the women’s side, while seniors Brandon McLaughlin and Nigel Koh as well as freshman Brian Koh represented the men’s team.
Mendez made it to the quarterfinals for the first time in her collegiate career after sweeping Stanford’s Madeleine Gill and Princeton’s Elizabeth Eyre in the first two rounds. The junior’s championship run came to an end when she played Sobhy in the quarterfinals, as Sobhy took an 11-4, 11-3, 11-1 decision from her teammate.

Break out your inner fashionista, because the Oscars are tonight! Before you get ready to judge who wore it best and who was an utter train wreck, you might want to take a look at the mathematical genius behind predicting the outcome of the awards.
Harvard’s very own Ben Zauzmer ‘15 has been predicting the Oscars since 2011, using a statistical regression model that is based on the premise that if something was a good indicator historically, then it will continue to be. The predictions for this year have “Frozen” leading with a 92% chance of winning the Best Animated Picture category. But for Best Picture, the winner seems to be “Gravity”; however, “12 Years A Slave,” the mathematical underdog, is a heavy favorite in the Oscar world and could upset the model. You can see the full list of Zauzmer’s predictions on the website of The Hollywood Reporter.  
 Zauzmer decided to marry his love of film and math during his freshman year, after seeing the growing trend of predicting political and sporting events. “I was sitting at the IOP after some event there and I was reading about the Oscars on my laptop, and I thought ‘Gosh you really should really be able to do these for the Oscars, even if there isn’t quite as much data, it’d be worth checking out if there was enough.’ So like any cool kid, I spent the next month in Lamont gathering data on Excel to actually try and run some regressions.”
“I do think that math is one of the best ways to predict the Oscars. It’s worked the last two years I believe there’s a lot of personal bias that comes in to play when you try to make predictions based off of just seeing the movies, as good the experts are. But that being said, it needs some of both. You need the science and you need the art. “
 When asked about his personal preferences, math aside, Zauzmer said, “My favorite movie of the year was ‘Frozen’. That, of course, did not get a Best Picture nomination… but I really liked ‘Captain Phillips’ and ‘Dallas Buyers Club.’”
 Zauzmer has collected some Harvard-related Oscar trivia. Both Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney say the word “Harvard” in “The Wolf of Wall Street” and “Gravity,” respectively, and three of the scripts nominated for mention either Harvard or the word “crimson.”
For example, in “Frozen” when Olaf first meets Anna he says crimson is a color for snow. And the film “Captain Phillips” held it’s premiere party at the Harvard Club. But perhaps the most interesting is that two of the nominated directors (Joshua Oppenheimer for “The Act of Killing” and Jehane Noujaim for “The Square”) for Best Documentary went to Harvard, each taught by the same professor and graduating within a year of each other. Three more Harvard alum round out the nominees in Best Picture (David Heyman, the producer for “Gravity” and Jeremy Kleiner, the producer for “12 Years A Slave”) and in the category for Short Film- Animated, with Lauren MacMullen for “Get a Horse!” 
“Some fields lend themselves really nicely to mathematical modeling, and the Oscars are not one of them. So, I’m doing the best I can with this. What I’d like to see is that some of the predictions are true, but that some of them surprise, and that’s what’ll make it exciting for the next year.” Each year, Zauzmer co-hosts an Oscar party, which will be held in Winthrop this year. He will be live-tweeting the Oscars for The Hollywood Reporter from his Twitter account @BensOscarMath. 
So grab your blocking group and get ready to judge the hell out of that red carpet.

Another Fifth Monday has come and gone, and everyone’s schedules have been finalized. While some of us are already regretting not dropping Math 21a, others are more than thrilled with their schedules. A select group of students had the ingenuity to choose courses that are truly out-of-the-box. Here they are, the most unorthodox courses being offered this semester:
 
1. Freshman Seminar 38z – Romancing the Kitchen: Food Culture Across the Romance Languages
Freshman, it looks like most of you missed out on the tastiest seminar Harvard has to offer. Once a week, students meet and discuss the great culinary masterpieces of Italy and France. Study spaghetti one week, and analyze croissants the next. Not only does this class give you the opportunity to brush up on your cooking skills, but you also get to avoid Annenberg’s “gourmet” menu.
 
2. Visual and Environmental Studies 80 – Loitering: Studio Course
Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. According to the CS50 course website, "Loitering" requires you to “hang out in the vicinity of culture and make things in response to it.” That’s right! You get class credit for spending hours at Starbucks. So if you’re worried that you procrastinate too much, maybe you should’ve taken this course. At least then you’d have a good excuse for practically living at Lamont Café.
 
3. Folklore & Mythology 172 – Quilts and Quiltmaking   
No, this is not a joke. Quilts and Quiltmaking is indeed a class, and it’s perfect for those of you looking for a more challenging craft. “I’m just like a grandma who likes to knit and drink tea, so quilting’s the next level,” says Sally McGrath ’17.  She loves learning about the history of quilts, and even gets to learn different quilt stitches during her weekly quilt lab. Not only can you make one for your final project, but after you graduate you can say that you spent your time at the nation’s finest institution learning about quilts. What more could you ask for?
 
Honorable Mention – Norwegian 90r.c.
Norwegian is very high on the list of obscure and impractical languages. You can only speak the language in Norway, and who would voluntarily go to a country that cold? Most of us can barely make it through the New England winter (these 15 cold freshmen can attest to that). But then again, practicing your loitering skills won’t be too difficult in Oslo with your brand new quilt.
