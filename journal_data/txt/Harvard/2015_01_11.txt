After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When edX courses Entrepreneurship 101 and 102 opened Friday, enrollees had an extra incentive to complete the courses: Users who pass either class will receive $1,000 in credit to spend on Amazon Web Services.
“[The Amazon offer] is to provide a valuable incentive for people to take and finish the course,” edX spokesperson Nancy Moss said.
In 2014, a series of working papers published by researchers at HarvardX showed that only about 5 percent of students enrolled in Harvard and MIT courses offered through edX in the 2012-2013 academic year earned certificates of completion. Moss said she anticipates that “thousands and thousands,” even “tens of thousands,” more registrants will complete the Entrepreneurship 101 and 102 courses because of the Amazon offer.
In addition to motivating students to complete their courses, edX, an online learning platform started by MIT and Harvard, has billed the credit offer as a way to help its entrepreneurship students launch their own start-ups. The Amazon credit offers students the ability to apply what they learn in Entrepreneurship 101 and 102, said course instructor William K. Aulet ’80, who teaches at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He said resources such as the Amazon-edX offer are essentially a necessity for entrepreneurship courses.
“This is what we do with our classes at MIT and Harvard,” Aulet said. “You offer students additional resources to take what you’re talking about and put it into practice. For aspiring entrepreneurs, it’s just something that really helps them launch their business and realize their dream of a new company.”
For entrepreneurship in particular, Aulet said, it can be difficult for students to apply what they learn, and so he said the offer could enhance the courses’ value.
“You may learn the stuff in a class, but you don’t really have a deep understanding of it until you apply it,” Aulet said. “Being able to have access to [Amazon Web Services] really takes the learning experience to another level.”
EdX is also offering successful Entrepreneurship 101 and 102 students several other opportunities. According to the edX blog post announcing the offer, students who pass either course can participate in web training, attend virtual office hours with experts, and receive assistance from companies that help start-ups.
As for the intention of incentivizing students to complete the courses, Erdin B. Beshimov, the producer of Entrepreneurship 101 and 102, said the Amazon-edX offer may indeed motivate students to finish the courses, but said it is not a sustainable solution to edX’s low completion levels.
“The way to fix dropout rates is to make better courses,” Beshimov said, adding, “This offer is really just a benefit for the students. Some of them will want to start ventures after completing the course, and this is a great way for them to get something online.”
According to Aulet, the online entrepreneurship courses already saw enrollment figures in the thousands when they were first launched on edX last year. Combined enrollment for the two courses started at 20,000 and eventually rose to more than 66,000, he said. He did not specify how many of those initial enrollees had finished the course.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Massachusetts District Court judge ruled against former Law School student Megon Walker late last month in a lawsuit she brought against the University in 2012 for defamation and breach of contract, seeking injunctive relief.
The ruling, a summary judgment, marks the end of a years-long legal battle that began when Walker sued affiliates of the Law School for damages due to disciplinary actions levied against her after the school’s Administrative Board concluded that she had committed plagiarism in 2009. Walker named the Harvard Corporation, then-Law School Administrative Board chair Lloyd L. Weinreb, and Ellen M. Cosgrove, the dean of students at the Law School, as defendants in the case.
In 2009, Walker, then a third-year student at the Law School, submitted a draft article to the Law School’s Journal of Law and Technology. After editors at the journal noticed a number of directly plagiarized and incorrectly cited passages and notified the dean of students, the school’s Ad Board heard the case. The body then issued a “letter of reprimand” to Walker, allowing her to graduate with her class, but leaving a permanent mark on her transcript.
The permanent mark was at the heart of Walker’s complaint. She not only argued that the Law School broke the procedures set out in its student handbook when it issued the reprimand, but that the plagiarized work did not represent a final submission, and, as such, the mark on her transcript represents defamation.
According to the complaint, filed in 2012, a 2008 job offer to Walker was withdrawn after the firm learned of the reprimand, and Walker has had trouble holding a job since.
In her complaint, Walker claims that the she knew the article she submitted to the journal had incorrect and incomplete citations because her computer suffered from a virus, damaging her work on the draft, but that she told the editors she planned to revise it.
In her decision in favor of Harvard, District Court judge Rya W. Zobel refuted both Walker’s complaint of defamation and breach of contract, citing the Merriam-Webster definition of “submit” and applying an objective reasonableness standard to the Law School Handbook of Academic Policies.
The lawyers who argued for each side of the case did not respond to requests for comment. Weinreb declined to comment and Cosgrove did not respond to a request for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
And so the 14-game tournament begins.
With the jump ball at halfcourt and junior co-captain Siyani Chamber’s step-back jumper from the free-throw line 31 seconds later, the Harvard men’s basketball team officially commenced its journey for its fifth-straight Ivy League title.
Forty minutes and an unlikely three-point battle later, and the Crimson (10-3, 1-0 Ivy) was one step closer to regaining its crown, as the team led from tip-off to final whistle on Saturday afternoon in a 57-46 victory over Dartmouth (6-7, 0-1) in Hanover, N.H.
Harvard relied on a bevy of jumpers in the opening minutes, including three first-half treys from sophomore guard Corbin Miller, along with some wild possessions down the stretch. The team had 17 turnovers in the game, offsetting the Crimson’s 50 percent shooting from the field.
“For that to become our first conference victory for us this season, a hard-fought game against a team that has always battled us well, especially here, I’m pleased for our guys,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
While the Crimson led by seven at intermission—thanks in large part to two consecutive threes and a stop-on-a-dime pull-up jumper from Miller—it took less than three minutes for it to extend its lead to double digits in the second period, as the sophomore curled around the top of the key and drilled a deep two just inside the arc with 17 minutes to play.
An unlikely Big Green (6-7, 0-1) threat from deep in 6’7” forward Connor Boehm, however, quickly stopped the Harvard run, matching Miller’s threes with a series of jumpers of his own.  Boehm, who came into the game having attempted only 10 threes all season, went 4-for-5 from deep on Saturday, effectively going blow-for-blow with Miller.
After Miller’s jumper gave his squad the 11-point advantage, 34-23, Boehm received the ball from guard Alex Mitola in the right corner, and drilled the three without hesitation. His baseline jumper on the next possession cut the lead to eight again, and the team closed the margin to five shortly thereafter at 38-33, the closest Dartmouth has been since the 4:39 mark of the first half.
But a hook shot from senior center Kenyatta Smith in the lane with 9:07 to play brought the Harvard bench to its feet and got the team in rhythm once more. Moments after Smith’s bucket, Chambers got the ball off of a missed Dartmouth jumper and pushed it up the court. He accelerated at the three-point line and took the rock down the left side of the lane, drawing the foul and connecting on the layup to complete the three-point play.
Two free throws, one apiece from Chambers and Smith, brought Harvard’s advantage back to double digits, 44-33, with 6:43 remaining, setting up Miller’s final dagger of the night.
With Dartmouth in a drought of its own—having gone scoreless for the last seven minutes of play—Miller held the ball near the half-court circle with the shot clock running down. With eight ticks left, he dribbled hard to his right, before bringing it back to his off-hand, pulling up just behind the top of the key. Over the outstretched arm of 6’9” forward Gabas Maldunas, Miller hit the trey, effectively sealing the game for the Crimson as it took its largest lead of the game, 47-33.
“[Dartmouth] did a great job,” Miller said. “They hit some key shots and made a run, they got it within five. [But] then we were able to make a run.”
From there, it was a matter of clock management.
While senior wing Wesley Saunders, Harvard’s leading scorer on the season, had been sidelined for much of the game with foul trouble, the Crimson brought him in late to help fight off the Big Green press. A series of free throws from Saunders and one final emphatic dunk from junior wing Agunwa Okolie clinched the victory for the Crimson.
Ultimately, according to Amaker, the Crimson knows to expect more of what it saw tonight as it heads deeper into conference play. It knows, he said, to anticipate a highly-contested, aggressive style of play whenever it takes the floor from now until March.
“[P]eople are going to be gunning for us and we are going to get people’s best effort by far,” Amaker said. “We know that and in particular on the road…. That’s going to be the norm for us. We are used to that by now and we hope that we are up to that challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With below-freezing temperatures outside of Lavietes Pavilion, the Harvard women’s basketball team couldn’t get its shooting to heat up indoors.
Having dropped two straight contests, the Crimson (6-8, 0-1 Ivy) took on Dartmouth (10-5, 1-0) Saturday night to open up Ancient Eight play. The Big Green, bolstered by a 13-2 second-half run, opened up a double-digit lead early after the break that Harvard couldn’t overcome. The home Crimson ended up dropping the first of its two showdowns with Dartmouth, 76-61.
“We know that Dartmouth is traditionally hard to play against,” junior guard Kit Metoyer said. “The Ivy League is a 14-game tournament, and there’s not a lot of breathing room to begin with. We know that we came out and we didn’t perform the way we wanted to, but we have to turn around and go right back to work on Monday.”
Tied at 29 with a minute to play in the first half, Big Green forward Lakin Roland knocked down a three-pointer to give the visitors the advantage heading into the break. The Crimson would never take the lead again.
Guard Fanni Szabo, who has averaged 18.2 points per game this season, opened up the second half with a 5-0 run of her own. Another trey by guard Milica Toskovic less than five minutes into the half extended Dartmouth’s lead to 11. The Big Green led by as much as 13 points before late free throws created a more lopsided score.
“I think it was the entire game, they wanted the ball more,” co-captain Erin McDonnell said. “They won the 50-50s, rebounds, some loose balls. They had more mental discipline than we did. It wasn’t that they did anything to us; it was kind of that we beat ourselves, and we just had too many mental breakdowns on defense.”
Dartmouth, which has hit 29.9 percent of its shots from beyond the arc this season, knocked down 60 percent of threes against Harvard, as well as 40.6 percent from the field in the second half. Meanwhile, the Crimson started the half just one-for-six from the field and struggled to generate offense.
“Basketball’s a beautiful game because it’s a game of runs,” Metoyer said. “If you get a few bounces to go your way, a lot can change, and I think Dartmouth stepped up and hit quite a few of those shots.”
Junior forward AnnMarie Healy and McDonnell led Harvard’s offense on the night, scoring 20 and 19 points, respectively. Healy put up seven of the Crimson’s first nine points and accounted for all of the home team’s points in the first seven minutes after halftime. The junior also notched a double-double with 11 boards and tied her career-high in points.
The Big Green exhibited a balanced attack throughout the night, with four players scoring in double-digits. Roland led Dartmouth with 25 points.
“We’ve got a very competitive spirit, but I think if you were to ask most people on the team, we weren’t as prepared as we should have been,” Metoyer said. “So much of the game is mental, and I think that’s something we’re going to be focusing on in the next 13 games is not only being ready for the scout and being ready for each team, but also stepping in between the lines and being ready.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A gritty defensive performance propelled the Harvard men’s basketball team (10-3, 1-0 Ivy) to its first conference victory of the season Saturday, a 57-46 decision over host Dartmouth (6-7, 0-1). Despite 17 team turnovers and just 19 minutes from senior wing Wesley Saunders, Harvard won on the road by holding the Big Green to just 33 percent shooting from the floor.
FIRING FROM THE HIP
The story of the game was sophomore guard Corbin Miller. The team’s first guard off the bench is Harvard coach Tommy Amaker’s “sixth starter” and a sparkplug for a Crimson offense that, through the first half of the season, is still struggling to find its identity.
Miller’s eight straight points midway through the first half were emblematic of what he brings to the team. Unlike recently graduated Laurent Rivard ’14—to whom Miller is often, lazily compared—Miller is unafraid of taking shots both off the dribble and in motion. Twice in the game, he up-faked a Big Green defender and calmly moved past to drain a deep jumper.
Miller is not in Rivard’s league as a defender, but he shares the former sharpshooter’s ability to take care of the ball—his 9.6 percent turnover rate is the lowest on the team—and accuracy from three (37.9 percent shooting).
“He is a terrific shooter, and it is nice when his teammates are aggressively looking for him,” Amaker said. “It gives him a lot of confidence, which it should. Like anyone else, he gets a rhythm.”
Eleven of Miller’s season-high 16 points came in the first half Saturday, as he nearly outscored the entire starting lineup (which totaled 16 first-half points) on his own. His three with less than six minutes remaining put Harvard up 14, its biggest margin of the game. On a night where Harvard’s two lead guards—Saunders and junior co-captain Siyani Chambers—combined for 10 turnovers, Miller didn’t commit a single error in 28 minutes of play.
“We like that rhythm that he brings off the bench,” Amaker said. “He’s a starter who just happens to come off the bench for us right now, and I think he likes that role. He is able to watch the game and analyze it a bit, and we slide him in there a bit and he’s been able to be really effective for us.”
LOCKING DOWN
While turnovers bogged down a Harvard offense that otherwise made 50 percent of its shots, the Dartmouth offense had a different problem—an inability to shoot. The Big Green made just six of its 20 three-pointers on the day, with leading scorer Alex Mitola hounded into a two-for-nine shooting night by Harvard’s cadre of guards.
Miller, who rotated in occasionally defending Mitola when Saunders went to the bench, said that the team’s defensive mentality centers on each player doing his part.
“We’ve got our rules defensively, and it’s to lock in and do our jobs individual and make sure we are talking and giving 100 percent,” Miller said.
For the fifth time this season, Harvard held an opponent to 20 points or less in a half when the Big Green managed just 20 in the opening frame. Dartmouth forward Connor Boehm’s four-for-six, 11-point second half helped keep the game close as his teammates made just five of their 16 second-half attempts.
At one point, Dartmouth went without a point for seven minutes, preventing the Big Green from ever getting closer than five even as Harvard’s offense stagnated.
LOST IN THE SWIM
Among the less notable but more indicative lines of the box score was that of senior forward Jonah Travis. A starter in the team’s first two games, Travis was sidelined with injuries for nearly a month and a half before coming in as a last-minute substitute against Virginia.
Since getting back, Travis has played increasingly sporadically. He had 20 minutes in the loss to Arizona State, taking the floor after starting center Kenyatta Smith struggled, but has tallied just 16 minutes in the three games since. Most of the minutes have been absorbed by sophomore Zena Edosomwan, who had a relatively quiet seven minutes (zero points, one rebound) Saturday.
Travis was even less effective against Dartmouth, with no field goal attempts or a rebound—just a turnover to show for the day’s work. He appears to have fallen to fifth in the depth chart, a sharp decline for a core member of the team’s forward rotation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK — The first time Ted Donato ’91 squared off against Yale away from the Bright-Landry Hockey Center as head coach of the Harvard men’s ice hockey team, he led the Crimson past its conference rival.
But nearly a decade removed from that 2005 result, Harvard (10-2-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) has yet to reproduce the same feat.
With a chance to end an 11-game winless streak away from home against the No. 19/- Bulldogs (9-4-2, 4-3-1) under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden Saturday, the No. 3/3 Crimson fell short, 4-1.
“We just looked like a team that wasn’t in sync, didn’t put [forth] a lot of energy, [and] didn’t execute very well,” Donato said. “I thought [Yale] outcompeted us, outskated us, outcoached us—you name it.”
The second edition of the Rivalry on Ice looked a lot like the inaugural game last January, when the Bulldogs emerged from the Big Apple with a 5-1 win. But unlike last season, instead of coming in with just five wins in 16 games, Harvard entered the game atop the Pairwise rankings having won its last seven contests.
But after surrendering multiple first-period goals for just the second time all season and then a third minutes into the second, the Crimson dug itself a hole it could not get out of.
“We got outplayed in the first period pretty badly, and that’s going to happen over time,” Donato said. “We were on the verge there [of coming back], but we never really got the game turned in our direction.”
Yale broke open the scoring 13:22 into the game. A foot from the boards, Bulldog defenseman Adam Larkin fired a shot at Harvard goaltender Steve Michalek, which ricocheted to sophomore forward Chris Izmirlian in the slot. From there, Izmirlian rocketed the puck on net, beating Michalek to put the Bulldogs on top.
Three minutes later, Yale struck again.
Streaking up the ice, junior center Carson Cooper launched a shot to Michalek’s left, pulling the netminder out of position. The puck sailed wide of the net, but one bounce later, it was on the stick of junior forward Cody Learned on the doorstep.
Nonetheless, Learned would be denied, as Michalek dove to his right, extending his left arm across the crease to stop the junior—one of his 38 saves on the night.
But with Michalek sprawled out on all fours, the puck squirted out to junior forward Charles Orzetti, who cleaned up the mess.
However, the goal would not come without controversy. After a brief conversation, the officials waved off the goal, determining that Cooper had beat the puck past the blue line when entering the zone. But after going to the replay booth, the officials overturned the offsides call, extending the Crimson deficit to two.
“Personally, I thought they got it wrong,” said Donato in reference to the call. “But for us, we have to be able to stop the bleeding and get back to doing the things we need to do to get the game turned around in our direction.”
Harvard had been in a similar hole before, having surrendered multiple goals in the first period and trailing at the break—both season firsts—in what proved to be a win over Rensselaer two weeks prior. But this time, the Crimson could not climb out.
Following a third goal for the Bulldogs courtesy of senior forward Matt Killian, Harvard got its only goal of the night 4:42 into the second period, after junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo delivered a pass to junior forward Jimmy Vesey in stride.
Catching the puck just outside the crease, the junior deked his way past Yale goaltender Alex Lyon, moving his way from left to right to tap in his 11th goal of the season. Vesey has now recorded at least a point in all 14 of Harvard’s games.
“After the first period, I knew we had to have some sort of response,” Vesey said. “Unfortunately they scored at the start of the second to make it 3-0. But I thought that goal to put it back to a two-goal margin was big.”
Having cut its deficit to 3-1, the Crimson had a chance to gain some momentum minutes later after a hooking penalty left Yale shorthanded. But on a night when Harvard came up empty on three power play opportunities, the Crimson failed to register a shot.
The Bulldogs put a cap on the night three minutes into the final frame, as defenseman Mitch Witek took advantage of a screen in front of the net to score his first goal of the season from the point. Yale finished the game with 42 shots, doubling Harvard's total of 21.
Although the game does not count towards the conference standings, Yale improves to 8-0-1 in its last nine matchups against the Crimson with the win. The last victory for Harvard against its Ivy League rival came back in March of 2012.
“If we want to be successful come March [and] April in the tournament, we’re going to have to play on big stages,” Vesey said. “This was a good learning curve for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s hockey team has encountered success this season that the program has not seen for a long time, climbing the ranks to No. 3/3 in the country with marquee victories over UMass-Lowell and Boston University.
But under the bright lights of Madison Square Garden against its most bitter rival, the Crimson found few positives, as its red-hot seven-game winning streak came to a screeching halt.
Two first period goals by No. 19/- Yale set the tone for the remainder of the night. Harvard was unable to register any form of consistent offense, as Yale stifled the Crimson attack in front of the predominantly pro-Bulldog crowd, defeating its archrival handily, 4-1.
“Obviously, we’re frustrated with the game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “[I] thought we got outplayed pretty much in every aspect."
BULLDOGS CONTINUE DOMINANCE
Harvard’s dry spell against the Bulldogs continued on Saturday night. The Crimson (10-2-2, 6-1-2 ECAC) has not emerged victorious in a tilt with Yale (9-4-2, 4-3-1) since March 2012 and has been outscored, 33-9, over that time frame. A pair of those losses came in the first round of last year’s ECAC playoffs, where Yale bounced Harvard in two straight games.
“We try to bring the same game every time, whether [it is] a good match-up against them,” Yale junior Mitch Witek said.
The Crimson fared similarly in the inaugural Rivalry on Ice game last year at the intersection of 34th and 7th in New York. After entering the second period tied, the Bulldogs tallied three straight goals, taking bragging rights home to New Haven.
Yale’s play was nothing short of dominant this time around. The Bulldogs registered 42 shots on the night, exactly double the total the Crimson managed to generate.
“I think that we played great defense to recover the puck,” Yale coach Keith Allain said. “I thought we did a good job in transition, and we had a fair amount of offensive possession time.”
INJURIES CATCH UP WITH CRIMSON
Junior defenseman Patrick McNally left the contest in the middle of the second period with an injury and did not return. The third-year veteran is the third-leading point scorer for Harvard, averaging just over a point per game.
"Guys get dinged up during the game, [but] obviously Pat's a big part of our team," Donato said. "He's key to the power play and five-on-five, he sees a lot of minutes, [and] he's one of the leading points per game guys in the country. That stuff happens, but obviously we could have done a better job dealing with it."
The Crimson offense was noticeably out of sync throughout the night, matching its lowest goal total of the year, which came in November’s earlier showdown with the Bulldogs. Harvard is still without its usual first line sophomore Alexander Kerfoot, who has been out of commission with an upper body injury. The second-year star leads the team in points per game, averaging 1.5 per contest.
Harvard has also lacked the services of Kerfoot’s classmate Sean Malone. The Buffalo Sabre draftee has contributed five points in the three games he has skated in.
CONTINUING THE RIVALRY ON ICE?
During its inception, the Rivalry on Ice was only granted a two-year trial. Now that those two years have passed, the future of the game hangs in limbo. But the sentiment from both teams is clear—Harvard and Yale want to suit up in Madison Square Garden for the foreseeable future.
“We’re very grateful of [the organizers],” Donato said. “I think there’d be a lot of reasons why this would be something great to carry on.”
Mark Messier and Billie Jean King were among the 12,774 people that saw Yale take home the Rivalry on Ice trophy for the second straight year.
“I certainly would like better results,” Donato said. “But I think the event itself is great. To play in Madison Square Garden in front of great crowds…. In a lot of ways, we couldn’t be happier with the game.”
