After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHENGDU, China—Although Chengdu is only the fourth largest city in China, and not well known in the Western world, it is at the center of the massive urbanization and modernization occurring throughout the country.  I have spent the past week here on a program through the IOP, meeting with government officials and business leaders, learning about the growth and development plan that is currently being implemented in Chengdu.
We are beginning to get a sense of the way that business works here.  The other day I was vividly reminded of an old American history lesson in high school about vertical integration in the steel industry.  We learned that large steel companies  owned the mines, the production mills, the distribution centers, and the train lines that distributed the finished product.
In Chengdu, we are seeing vertical integration on the city level.  The government (or rather, members of the Chinese Communist Party) carefully designs new buildings and office parks to attract major companies to bring their business to Chengdu; it provides office space and seed funding for start-up businesses; it doles out grants to “NGOs” providing services to needy members of the community.  It feels like the Western conception of the diversified enterprise has been applied to the city.  Rather than various branches of the company working independently, but sharing executive administration, the various businesses in the city work independently of each other, but all play a role in the government’s larger plans for the city to increase its profit and output.
Certainly, there are interesting debates to be had about the economic advantages and disadvantages of this model, but seeing the system in action has also raised a more profound question in my mind: what is the ultimate goal of an entire city?
The workings of a company of any scale can ultimately be reduced to a complicated optimization problem with many input and output variables; the final goal being to maximize profits.  But should a city be in the business of optimizing profits?  If not, what should it optimize?  It is easy to argue that seeking profit above all ignores important considerations such as quality of life, but it is harder to specify a viable alternative metric.  I have no answer, but I think that cities like Chengdu will serve as interesting testing grounds for a question that may become increasingly important in today’s increasingly urbanized world.

CAMBRIDGE, United Kingdom—At the back of the dining hall of Trinity College, Cambridge (we just call it “hall,” with no article—as in, “I’m going to hall for dinner!”) there’s a raised platform. Unlike the raised part of Quincy dining hall, the tables on this platform face the rest of the tables in the dining hall at a right angle. And also unlike the raised parts of Quincy dining hall, students are not allowed here. High Table is where fellows—post-docs on research fellowships and faculty associated with the College—eat their breakfasts, lunches, and dinners sitting up above the lowly undergraduate and graduate students, enjoying nicer food served to them with real silver cutlery and strawberries every night.
At 7:30 pm each night, that night’s dinner guests file in, often wearing black robes. Someone rings a gong and everyone in hall must stand silently while the College Master reads a prayer in Latin—even if you’re sitting below and have already finished your meal. Grace at the high table takes precedence over the continuity of undergraduate dinnertime conversations.
Professors praise High Table as a social and intellectual space where they can exchange valuable interdisciplinary conversation lubricated by unlimited free alcohol. But High Table also institutionalizes a strange hierarchy into Trinity College life. Why do the fellows here dine in the same hall as undergraduates but on a raised platform apart from them? My guess is that it’s the same reason there are lawns in this College that only fellows can walk across and everyone else must walk around: partly, to give younger scholars something to aspire to, and partly, because that’s the way it’s always been and no one wants to change it now.
A few weeks ago, Amartya Sen, current professor of economics at Harvard and former Master of Trinity College, came to visit Cambridge, UK. As a former Master, he sat in the throne at the head of the table at High Table dinner. Someone from the dining hall staff rung a gong, and I put down my mashed potatoes to stand while Amartya Sen read a Latin prayer. Having met Professor Sen at Harvard, seeing him at High Table made me reflect even more strongly on the contrast between Trinity and Harvard. If someone rang a gong every evening in Quincy House as the Masters were about to eat dinner, would everyone drop their forks and stand for a Latin prayer? My hunch is that they would not—we are much too irreverent, and not just in the religious sense. (Then again, Harvard students are fond of tradition. When our University declared in 1961 at it would change its diplomas from Latin to English, thousands of students protested on the steps of Widener.)
Some days at lunchtime here I’ll cast my eyes up to the High Table and notice that of the twenty or so fellows dining there, every single one is a white-haired man. Perhaps the fellows of Trinity College are disproportionately old men. Perhaps these are the fellows who like the tradition of High Table best, and thus forsake lunch with their families (surely some of them must have wives or kids?) to dine with their intellectual peers in hall. Either way, it seems that High Table may be functioning more to maintain the social hierarchy than anything else. If High Table is supposed to be an inspirational performance for undergraduates, I can imagine it might be hard for female students, or students of color, to imagine themselves up in what is an extremely white-male-dominated space. And if it’s supposed to be a place for interdisciplinary conversations, there are some important voices missing. Perhaps there are some traditions that ought to be changed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
GABORONE, Botswana—There are two emotions that will forever spring to my mind whenever I recall my arrival in Gaborone, Botswana to conduct HIV/AIDS research. One is of an unbearable excitement to set foot on the African continent for the first time and embark on what promised to be a hugely transformative internship and adventure. The second is of a humored surprise at seeing cows on the road. To me, this was an image that captured the funny stage of development that Botswana is in, where modernity and tradition constantly rub elbows, and it was one that seemed to augur the delights that awaited me during my stay in this new country.
I indeed made unforgettable memories from immersing myself in the unique and peculiar aspects of Botswana’s culture and tourist attractions: seeing giraffes, baboons, and ostriches in their natural habitat; learning a bit of Setswana; experiencing biweekly power outages; admiring the decorated cow horns and hand-carved wooden masks for sale in marketplaces; and sampling delicious traditional Botswana cuisine. But what left a deeper impression on me was the extent of the similarity between Gaborone and Cambridge.
While I was eager to try the traditional maize drink maheu, the Batswana were guzzling coke. Fellow interns from the University of Botswana sent me Facebook friend requests sooner than I could ask if they also used Facebook. And it was not just Western culture that had infiltrated Botswana. On my first visit to the local grocery store, a food server rushed toward me with excitement because she thought I looked like a character in her favorite TV show Boys Over Flowers. I had never imagined that Korean dramas would be popular among Batswana women like Samantha, but by then I had realized that “Gabs” was so globalized that there was nothing to be unexpected. When walking through the store’s aisles, I would be confronted by such a huge variety of foreign brands and products that I’d sometimes forget that I wasn’t back home in North America.
Except there was one key difference: Botswana has the second highest HIV infection rate in the world, a staggering one-third of adults in Botswana are HIV-positive, and HIV/AIDS is the country’s leading cause of mortality. There is nothing, really, in the developed world that is comparable to HIV/AIDS and its far-reaching social and economic impact, both past and present, in Botswana and other high-burden countries. Despite the calm and cheerfulness with which the people I met and befriended went about their everyday lives, the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS epidemic unmistakably lurks within the national psyche.
I felt this from Samantha’s fears about being tested for HIV, confided to me in a hushed voice. I saw this in the startling statistics I read in journal articles and heard discussed at lab seminars. When I accompanied community health workers as they conducted village household surveys for a community-based HIV prevention project, I heard this in the heave of relief from a villager when she found out she was HIV-negative, and deduced this from the fact that large-scale HIV research projects need to be undertaken in the first place. Experiencing first-hand the impact of HIV/AIDS on a high-burden population made me truly understand the scope of the HIV/AIDS problem in this area of the world and put human faces on the victims of this devastating disease. Consequently I felt that the research I did this summer was the most important and imperative that I have ever done.
I had never been as emotionally involved with lab samples as I was during my orientation week at the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP). I was doing a rotation in the DNA/PCR lab and testing blood samples of infants born to HIV-positive mothers for the presence of HIV infection, and each time a test result forced me to draw a circled cross in red ink beside a sample ID I was distraught by the fact that I had diagnosed yet another infant as HIV-positive. When one of the BHP lab assistants told me that he, like most BHP employees, had lost many family members to HIV/AIDS and works with the hope that scientific research will bring about an AIDS-free generation, I understood the strong personal connection between Batswana employed in HIV/AIDS-related fields and their work. Now, having spent a summer alongside the Batswana, many of whom have become cherished friends, inspirational mentors, and lifelong teachers, fighting HIV/AIDS has become a personal mission for me as well.
