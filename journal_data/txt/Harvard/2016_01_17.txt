After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

WASHINGTON, D.C.—In a game marked by turnovers, long scoring droughts, and physical play on both ends of the floor, Harvard (9-8, 1-0 Ivy League) overcame Howard (8-10, 2-1 MEAC), 69-61, on Saturday afternoon. In a historic meeting for the two schools and a homecoming for Harvard coach Tommy Amaker, Harvard rode an 8-0 run late in the second half to put the Bison away for good and finish non-conference play with a .500 record.
With eight minutes to go, a three-pointer by Howard junior guard Keon Hill tied the contest for the fourth time of the afternoon. When the teams returned to the floor, Crimson senior forward Patrick Steeves, who finished the game with eight turnovers, drove into the lane and hit an off-balance layup. After his team picked up a stop on the other end, freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy, who had four turnovers of his own, buried a three. The dagger came the next time down the floor when  junior guard Corbin Miller drained a trey from the corner to put Harvard up eight. The Bison took a timeout with 6:05 to play but it was the closest the hosts would get the rest of the way.
“We got it in, and then we got it out for three-point shots,” Amaker said. “Zena’s interior production helped us to settle us down, he made his free throws, and then we got the ball back out to get some open threes and we nailed them.”
After a slow start by both teams, the Crimson looked as though it would secure the victory by halftime. Harvard’s first five field goals all came from behind the arc, as Steeves and Miller combined to outscore Howard 15-6 to start the game. The Crimson would only score 11 points the rest of the half, however, as Harvard finished the first 20 minutes with 14 turnovers and entered halftime down one.
With freshman sharpshooter Corey Johnson’s sidelined with an illness, the Crimson’s bench became thinner when senior forward Agunwa Okolie and freshman big man Balsa Dragovic both pick up their fourth personal fouls before the second half’s first media timeout. With the team’s starting frontcourt on the bench, junior forward Zena Edosomwan decided to establish the inside presence Harvard had been lacking. With Harvard leading by three, Edosomwan scored six of the next 12 Crimson points.
“I just was definitely more aggressive and, for me, I like to let the game come to me,” Edosomwan said. “And then in the second half when I was more aggressive, I picked it up and I started seeing more openings and I didn’t like the way I was finishing early in the first half so I picked it up. There’s plenty of games where the first half is kind of slow but you know, on switch.”
The Bison hung with Harvard during the stretch not letting the lead get to more than five points, and a 7-2 Howard run set the stage for the heroics that followed the under-eight timeout.
“Close games definitely help,” Steeves said. “We have veteran guys, [captain] Evan Cummins has been in countless games like that, he knows exactly what to do when it comes down to the wire in a game. Agunwa Okolie, the same thing, he was in foul trouble but late in the game he came up for us and we were able to keep ourselves collected.”
The Crimson finished the game with 25 turnovers, its most this season, but with only three in the game’s final 7:47. The lack of turnovers and a reenergized defense were the keys to the closeout. Steeves added 12 points in the game’s final eight minutes to lead the Crimson with 18, and Harvard finished the game by making seven of its final nine shots.
The Bison finished the game with four double-digit scorers, with guards Dalique Mingo and Damon Collins contributing 14 apiece, but the team came up short despite the electric atmosphere at a sold-out Burr Gymnasium. Perhaps more detrimental to Howard, the Bison was without junior guard James Daniel III, as the nation’s leading scorer was sidelined with an elbow injury.
Amaker was able to pick up a win in the D.C. Metropolitan Area for the first time since 2011. The Falls Church, Va. native who starred at Woodson High School in Fairfax had a large contingent of family and friends behind his team’s bench.
“It’s definitely great to be home,” Amaker said. “We have other staff members from the area so to have the chance to be in front of your folks, people who have known you your entire life, you know how that can be if things don’t go for you, they won’t let you forget it your entire life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With its undefeated record on the line, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team rose to the challenge, sweeping aside a pair of Ivy League rivals to stay perfect and keep its first-place spot in the Ancient Eight.
In the team’s lone home meet of the season, the Crimson (5-0, 5-0 Ivy) overcame Brown (1-5, 0-5), 174.5-125.5, and downed University of Pennsylvania (6-3, 4-3), 192-108, this weekend.
“The meet went very well,” co-captain Margaret Ramsey said. “Coming back from a hard training trip, the team looked strong in the water and on the boards. We reach our peak training during this month and [we are happy] to have performed like we did after many difficult practices.”
Harvard’s success came from strong performances across the team, as six different Crimson swimmers came away with wins.
Junior Willa Wang notched Harvard’s first victory, taking first in the 1000-meter free in 10:11.89. Wang beat out Penn’s Carolyn Yang by just over a second, and sophomore Regan Kology took third place, less than half a second behind.
The result was quickly matched when junior Victoria Chan won the 200-meter free, closely followed by freshman teammate Sonia Wang. Wang got a victory of her own later in the day, winning the 200-meter butterfly with a time of 1:59.96.
The Crimson’s strong showing continued, as Harvard swimmers went on to sweep the podium in the 100 back, with senior Danielle Lee, sophomore Kristina Li, and junior Marissa Cominelli taking first, second, and third, respectively.
The result was not the Crimson’s only sweep of the day in the pool. Harvard put in a commanding performance in the 200-meter back to finish 1-2-3 once more, as senior Kendall Crawford took top honors, followed by Li and sophomore Geordie Enoch.
Junior Daniela Johnson would go on to pick up the Crimson’s final win of the meet in the 200 IM. The Miami, Fla. native touched the wall first with a time of 2:05.35, a little over a second ahead of Carter Orth of Penn.
Harvard proved its depth with a number of podium finishes in the relay events as well.
Crimson swimmers took second and third in the first event of the day, the 200-meter medley relay, as the Harvard A team of Lee, Enoch, Chan, and freshman Brittany Usinger edged out the B squad of Crawford, Johnson, freshman Megan Popp, and Sophomore Gabby Sims.
The Crimson also finished the day with a second-place result in the 400 freestyle relay, with Brown’s A team edging out Sonia Wang, Chan, Sims, and freshman Holly Christensen.
Harvard shone on the diving boards as well, taking the top three spots in the three-meter and sweeping the top four in the one-meter event.
Sophomore Hannah Allchurch dominated on the day and came away with wins in both events. Her score of 302.65 easily earned her top marks in the three-meter event, placing her ahead of junior Elina Leiviska in second and freshman Katie Russ in third place. Allchurch also paced the Crimson in the one-meter, with freshman Mikaela Thompson, sophomore Alisha Mah, and Leiviska finishing 2-3-4 in the event.
The competition was the last home meet for Harvard’s seven seniors – Ramsey, Lee, Crawford, Daniela Suarez-Rebling, Shori Hijikata, Sherry Liu, and Marlee Ehrlich - and the team honored the group of veterans for their contributions to the team.
“[We saw] great leadership and races from our seniors,” said Harvard coach Stephanie Wriede Morawski ’92. “This was their Senior Recognition meet, and we dedicated it to them for their leadership, compassion, devotion and friendship over the years.”
As the team enters the back end of the season, with a final dual meet against Princeton and Yale looming and championship tournaments approaching, this weekend’s result is an encouraging one.
“I think this result definitely gives us momentum going into HYP and Ivies,” Enoch said. “It was nice to get confidence from the wins today, because Yale and Princeton are very strong teams and they will definitely push us during the end of the season meets. But even though we're excited about today's wins, we're not comfortable by any means, and we've got a few more weeks of hard work to put in before the season's done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the fourth time in five years, the Harvard men’s tennis team started off its spring schedule with a win. And for the second season in a row, it came at the expense of William & Mary.
The Crimson wasn’t finished for the day after defeating the Tribe, however, and dispatched Boston College in another dual match several hours later. The second win capped a solid return to action for Harvard at the Murr Tennis Center, where it hadn’t played a competitive match since early October.
With the 4-3 triumph over William & Mary (1-1) and 6-1 victory over its crosstown rival Eagles (0-2), the Crimson (2-0) started its spring slate off strong.
“These two matchups were great ones to start the year with,” Harvard sophomore Grant Solomon said. “They were tough opponents, and it was good to see where we’re at before we go up against even tougher competition the next few weeks.”
HARVARD 6, BOSTON COLLEGE 1
The Crimson started fast in its late afternoon match against the Eagles, taking the doubles point with a close 2-1 win.
Despite not calling upon any of his three nationally ranked doubles teams, Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 found winning combinations by pairing senior Nicky Hu with sophomore Kenny Tao and senior Conor Haughey with classmate Kelvin Lam. Hu and Tao won their set 6-4, while Haughey and Lam won theirs, 7-5.
“At this point in the season, rankings don’t really mean much,” Fish said. “We wanted to give some seniors who don’t have a lot of experience playing doubles the chance to compete, and they responded really well.”
The third Crimson doubles team, made up of freshman Michael Peters and sophomore Jean Thirouin, did not find the same success despite facing fellow underclassmen from Boston College, sophomores Jeffrey Melvin and Kent Mukai. Melvin and Mukai won the set, 6-2.
In singles, Harvard found wins easier to come by, and quickly clinched a victory in the overall proceedings by reeling off five straight-sets wins.
Freshman Andy Zhou eased by Eagles No. 1 Hank Workman, 6-3, 6-1. Zhou was able to earn the win on his first official day of collegiate tennis, overcoming Workman and his two years of experience as a starter.
Meanwhile, Haughey and Lam showed no signs of fatigue from their doubles match, doing their part to clinch the overall victory for the Crimson. Their straight-sets wins gave the team a 4-0 lead on the day, ending hopes of a Boston College comeback.
HARVARD 4, WILLIAM & MARY 3
Earlier in the afternoon, the Crimson was able to take the doubles point from the Tribe as well, setting the stage for a similarly quick win.
Against William & Mary, Fish sent up two of his three ranked doubles teams. Hu and Tao were key to Harvard’s success just as against Boston College, though they had different partners.
Hu and junior Brian Yeung, forming the No. 44 doubles team in the country, dispatched their opponents, 6-2. Tao and junior Sebastian Beltrame, the No. 32 pairing nationally, also won their set, 6-3.
Zhou and Haughey, however, could not overcome Tribe sophomores Christian Cargill and Alec Miller, who came away with the 6-3 win.
“We’re cautiously optimistic that we’ll be able to count on our doubles more this year,” Fish said. “We had a great start yesterday, so we’ll be looking to build on that.”
The Crimson and Tribe split their singles matches, 3-3, but by virtue of Harvard winning its games in straight-sets and William & Mary winning its games in three sets, the Crimson clinched victory in the overall dual match before the Tribe could respond.
Strong performances by Beltrame, Tao, and Zhou, playing at the No. 2, 3, and 4 spots respectively, put Harvard up 4-0. Though Hu, Lam, and Thirouin fought their opponents to three sets, none of them were able to pull out victories.
“Once Andy won his match, the mentality changed for the players still on the court,” Solomon said. “That’s something that unfortunately happens, and we’ll work on it.”
