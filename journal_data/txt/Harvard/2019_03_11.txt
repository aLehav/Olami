After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly three years ago, Solange released one of the best albums of 2016. An elegant and hallowed tale of “identity, empowerment, independence, grief and healing” — particularly in the context of modern blackness and femininity — “A Seat at the Table” set a strong precedent for its follow-up. Her new album, “When I Get Home,” not only does “A Seat at the Table” justice, but establishes a new development in the era of graciousness and strength that defines Solange. Like an Impressionist painting, the value of “When I Get Home” lies in its movement and cohesiveness rather than precision or detail. As a result of this distinct style, Solange’s fourth studio album is a mellow, intoxicating experience — slightly drifting, yet purposefully so.
In the span of the album's 19 tracks and 39 minutes, “When I Get Home” comforts, intrigues, and excites with its steady rotation of synthetic instrumentals, faithful features, and compelling interludes. Given the album’s star-studded production team (including Dev Hynes, Steve Lacy, and Pharrell) and contributions from Playboi Carti, Gucci Mane, and Tyler the Creator, one would expect nothing less.
Solange begins by leading the listener into a string of laconic, repetitive verses (“I saw things I imagined / I saw things I imagined”) that gradually warp from ambient and dreamlike to syncopated and synth-heavy in “Things I Imagined.” This careful and measured transition foreshadows the seamless progression of sound that characterizes the rest of the album. As one track bleeds into the next, “When I Get Home” departs from the chronological sense of structure many albums claim. In “Stay Flo,” Solange declares her nonlinear, almost cyclical route as she sings, “Down, down, down on the floor / Down, down, down on the floor,” an informal reprise of the album’s third track “Down with the Clique.”
The stand-out of the album, “Almeda,” features Playboi Carti and The-Dream. Named after a Southwest Houston locale near Knowles’ place of birth, “Almeda” is the epitome of a masterful collaboration, respecting the distinguished sounds of each high-profile musician while also marrying them in an incredibly charming manner. In a thread of perhaps the most memorable lines of the entire album, Solange’s sings, “Black skin, / black braids / Black waves, black days / Black baes, black things / These are black-owned things / Black faith still can't be washed away.” Playboi Carti joins Solange — triumphantly and anthemically — in the final line of her second verse, “Black molasses, blackberry the masses.” Though it may seem a bit busy or disjointed at first listen, “Almeda” is a clear nod to the sonically-pleasing chopped and screwed style of '90s Houston area hip-hop. The three unlikely collaborators produce a well-integrated, cohesive sound: Playboi Carti’s definingly infectious flow and The-Dream’s luscious refrain complement Solange’s rousing, self-assured tone.
The album’s second major collaboration, “My Skin My Logo,” presents Solange’s monotone, low-register vocals against a jazzy, toe-tapping instrumental. Singing alongside Gucci Mane’s steady verses, Solange creates tension as her voice crescendos into a sensual high-pitched falsetto at the end of the song. “My Skin My Logo” is emblematic of imprecise yet wholly connected path the listener follows throughout the album. Although the sound of Solange and her collaborators may wander at times, she ultimately returns to form with the airy, psychedelic, and chopped sound of “When I Get Home.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
March 2016
It is Sunday and outside the window, it is snowing. Concrete and brick roofs are steadily being layered with powder, each snowflake building upon the one that came before in a way that seems to Juan strangely democratic. They accumulate, by now so numerous that they have congealed into a mass more powerful, more monumental than any one individually.
Juan remembers how he first learned about snow in elementary school. He spends a few moments rooting around in his head, past visions of times that refuse to leave his consciousness whenever unearthed, dodging sounds of tear gas canister screams, running past doors bulging with beaten bodies, limbs still young and limber despite decay. Finally, he reaches a foggy wisp of a thing and lets it curl its smoky tendrils around his brain, slowly sketching out the primary colors and unashamed laughter of Colegio Esdras. Juan allows himself to sink into the memory, inhabiting his eight-year-old body. The teacher at the front of the room is holding up a laminated poster of the Swiss Alps. Juan’s classmates murmur, small bodies glistening with that constant layer of sweat that lingers in the Latin tropics, eyes wide as they take in a natural phenomenon they will only see if they climb the peaks of Pico Bolivar. As if through a distorted microphone, Juan hears his teacher’s voice. Her speech fades in and out but one phrase comes through more clearly than the others. “The beautiful thing about snow, niños, is that every single snowflake is unique. None is like the other.”
Señorita Perez’s voice fades quickly until Juan can only hear the masticated outlines of sentences, then words, then letters. The classroom disappears, primary colors to monochrome to the dirt gray of Queens slush. Señorita Perez’s remarks float behind his eyes. Every snowflake unique. None like the other. Juan stares at the banks collecting on the sidewalk in front of his window and struggles to find the individuality in each flake. As he watches, eyes squinted in an effort to pick out any distinguishing ridge, he wonders how he is different from them. Five months ago, he was Juan Morales, 24 years old and beloved legal aid of Maria Corina Machado, the only opposition leader whose hands were still clean. Individuality was his, despite the never-ending cacophony of state propaganda that wove “individual” and “state” together so tightly it was nearly impossible to tell them apart. Five months ago, Juan had no time to stare out of windows. Five months ago, his life was frenzied race from car to door, eyes trained at all times on Maria Corina and their guards, ears accustomed to picking out the quick whoosh of a bottle leaving the hand of a colectivo member just in time to dodge its trajectory. He accesses this memory with detachment, brown eyes unmoving from the snow that has picked up outside. A part of his brain tells him this might be his first blizzard in the United States. He ignores it in favor of living in December 6, 2015.
No haze surrounds his recollection of that day. The muted blues and eggshell creams that always made him a bit uneasy take no time to paint the sides of his brain, as they did the walls of an apartment he spent too many hours in. Juan is sitting on that well-worn couch, crammed close to four others. Maria Corina is standing, having refused a seat the first three times they offered. Too many nerves, she had said. I have to get rid of them somehow. The sound of a newscaster rattling off too quickly streams out in a tinny tone from the desktop computer perched on a table at the front of the room. It is the only source of noise in a group of people whose usual camaraderie and impassioned discourse bubbled together in good-hearted symphonies halted only by Maria Corina’s conductor baton of a voice. Now, however, the only audible noises are the laptop news anchor and Juan’s sharp inhales at the announcement of another state polling place closing. There were only a few districts left to count, including the Capital district, and the MUD, Venezuela’s primary opposition coalition, was neck and neck with the government’s party. 24 years of life in a Venezuela overrun by the Bolivarian Revolution’s obsession with corruption and power had taught Juan never to count on something until it was in his hands. Even so, this was the closest the opposition had come to a majority in the National Assembly in his entire lifetime. Just as Juan’s fist clenched with the surety that his house of hope would come crumbling down, another district’s polls closed and the little blue rectangle that was the MUD’s seats inched forward.
A phantom smile lingers around the edge of Juan’s mouth as he hears the roar of his colleagues at the unlikely victory that day. Despite Maria Corina not being allowed to run this time around, she had been ecstatic.
This is where it starts Juan. Vamos con todo.
Only five months ago.
He comes to, eyes re-focusing and face hardening when white fills his vision and not the green-brown-yellow hue of home. The snow is falling harder now.
Five months. Not even half a year has passed and already he feels like the snow bank. His sun-beaten face, an unfamiliar pale derivation now under the restricted winter sun, seems to him to blur with the faces of others he is surrounded by. The five other men he shares this one-bedroom with become the Colombians and Puerto Ricans and Mexicans he stands next to all day, lifting heavy boxes of flowers in a below freezing warehouse, become the Dominican family who own the bodega across the street become him.
Juan stares at the snow a little longer, trying to remember why he started.
He doesn’t.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Laptops opened. Google Docs shared. When2meet links sent. Reminder sent again. Rooms booked. Canva pub prepared. Agenda set. Ice breaker ready. Google Calendar shared. Tasks delegated. Grievances aired. Strategies discussed. Ideas proposed. GroupMe made. Emails collected. Grants written. Co-sponsorships found. Food ordered. Recruitment. Community building. Student Involvement Fair. Visitas. Pubs sent. Events put on. Statements drafted. Rallies planned. Board meeting. General meeting. Committee meeting. Administration meeting. Working group. Repeat.
These actions and thoughts have filled my mind and my schedule for the majority of my time at Harvard. Our days are split up into our mornings, where we schedule in our classes, and afternoons and nights, where we schedule in our extracurriculars. Board after board, I found myself in these scenes that many students find themselves in across campus. The work must get done. The events must get planned.
We prioritize extracurriculars as we take on leadership positions and suddenly find ourselves falling behind in lecture because we had to finalize logistics for an event we were running after class. Homework time is scheduled in around our many meetings. Caffeine keeps us going as we juggle packed schedules.
The fact that we do all of it for free goes unacknowledged. Our passions motivate us to get involved, but it becomes harder and harder to stay motivated as the stress increases and our efforts are met with administrative inaction. We beg administrators to fund our events as we try to fill the gaps in this institution that loves boasting its large number of diverse student-run organizations but fails to provide us with the proper resources to thrive in this space that wasn’t created for us. We carve out space for ourselves and generations to come by getting involved in groups on campus. As we take more responsibility in creating these spaces, it becomes harder to feel the benefits.
Students take on the burden of providing support for other students when Harvard won’t do it. A prime example of this can be found with the creation of FYRE, the pre-orientation program for students from “historically marginalized communities.” Though students involved in its first year this past August enjoyed the program, it was ultimately only a consolation prize after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana rejected a full summer bridge program. In his statement for the pre-orientation program, Khurana specified that it would be run by “student leaders” who volunteered for the positions as with all the pre-orientation steering committees.
The burden also falls on students involved in peer counseling groups as they try to fill the gaps in Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services despite constant demand for more counselors, particularly counselors of color. These groups are run by students for free — students who have their own mental health to worry about.
Upperclassmen are tasked with the responsibility of welcoming first-year students and creating community for students from marginalized backgrounds to find space at Harvard. Black convocation and Latinx convocation have all been put on by students who recognize the need for community to exist on campus — if it weren’t for the students, nothing would get done. There is no institutional memory to carry on the tradition each year.
Students get overworked as pressure is put on them to run whole organizations. We become the faces of them, and all that is done behind the scenes is rarely acknowledged. We try to balance our time with classes, jobs, and extracurriculars, risking our academics and mental health in the process.
Students get taken advantage of through these programs and it exposes us to how little administrators care about us once we’re here. When it gets harder and harder to keep up, students fall through the cracks. I’ve seen it happen with many of my own friends who were forced to leave campus or did so voluntarily. Either way, this is part of a vicious cycle as students are taken advantage of by an institution that perpetuates it. We need to see huge changes being made to the way students are compensated for their labor and recognize when Harvard is exploiting us to do the work they should be taking responsibility for themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I still vividly remember the first time I openly stated that I am a feminist, during a class in high school. My Theory of Knowledge teacher instructed his students, “If you think you’re a feminist, raise your hand.” The question caught everyone off guard — there was a brief moment of silence when my classmates and I just looked at each other, unsure of what to do. As feminism was not a topic that we often discussed in our daily conversations, we were all taken aback. To make sure what I vaguely knew about feminism was correct, I asked, “Isn’t feminism essentially advocating for gender equality?” My teacher smiled and looked at me. Another student said, “Well, if feminism means that, shouldn’t we all be feminists?” That was when people in the classroom started raising their hands one by one, until every hand was raised.
If this open and step-by-step approach were the attitude that most people held when they talk about feminism, the number of people who identify as feminists would be much larger than it is now. Unfortunately, the reality is that the public often has preformed ideas about feminism, misconceptions that hinder them from engaging in informed conversations about this topic. For example, when talking with a group of friends back home in Korea, a peer started to say that he doesn’t really like feminism. Another friend responded, telling the whole group that we should stray from political conversations. These two comments struck me as particularly problematic, for feminism is not something that should be simply “liked” or “disliked,” nor should it be strictly defined as a political issue that people can take sides on.
Misconceptions about feminism vary, but some recurring themes are the association of feminism with the perceived desire of women to bring men down and their ostensible hatred of men. Yet the dictionary definition of feminism is as follows: “The theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes; or organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests.” Nowhere in the official definition listed does it say that feminism is a vicious movement led by women who hate men and desire to subjugate them.
If so many of the misconceptions of feminism have to do with the bias associated with feminist women, should feminism be called something neutral like a “gender equality movement?” Not only does this seemingly neutral term sound a lot more wordy, it also takes out the emphasis on the female identity that has made feminism so powerful. Yes, some types of feminism such as radical feminism, which emphasizes the patriarchal roots of inequality and aims to dismantle the patriarchy, do have an element of women being angry — not at the entire male population, but at the systems of gender inequality in this world. Whether people like it or not, feminism originated from women who found existing patriarchal societies problematic, and we need to respect that women are core constituents of feminism. Yet, this does not at all mean that feminism should only be for women. In fact, there is a dire need for more, if not all, men to become feminists as well.
On the surface, there seems to be less of an incentive for men to be feminists because they do not have much to risk compared to women. But for the feminist movement to succeed in dismantling patriarchal social systems and giving everyone regardless of their sex and gender equal opportunities, men must become feminist. I believe feminism at its core is the acknowledgement of the fact that the world is not at all fair. Gender inequality is prevalent everywhere, ranging from the pay gap between men and women to work-life balance. This constitutes the first argument for why men should be feminists: The world is problematic, and it is just not right for men to sit back and continue the unjust social structure that discriminates against women.
The next argument is that feminism actually liberates both men and women from social pressures. Some may question this argument, thinking that men already have the power to pursue whichever role in society they want. But in reality, gender stereotypes and social conditioning pressure people to take on or avoid certain jobs. For example, men are told not to be hair stylists or flight attendants, while women are told not to have military careers or take on any “dangerous” work. Feminism can bring us closer to a society with no gender inequality, in which everyone can choose to take on roles they fit best in, not ones they are pressured into.
Finally, feminism has tangible economic benefits for the world as a whole. According to a McKinsey Global Institute report, $12 trillion could be added to global GDP by 2025 by advancing women’s equality. If everyone regardless of gender identity can contribute to the economy and occupy various positions in society, the world can truly become a better place.
I’d like to admit that I still have a lot to learn about the history of the feminist movement and what it means to be a feminist. However, I still believe with confidence that I am a feminist. As Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie puts it, “a feminist is a man or a woman who says, ‘Yes, there's a problem with gender as it is today, and we must fix it. We must do better.’” I think the world today is plagued with gender inequality, and I want this to change. Therefore, I am a feminist. And you, especially if you’re a man, should be one too.

Thursday morning, the Winthrop House community received an email from Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. admonishing The Harvard Crimson — particularly the content of this Board — and its presentation of opinions surrounding his legal representation of film producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces allegations of sexual misconduct by over 80 women. Sullivan alleges that our coverage has limited the opportunity for "deep and robust discussions," limiting discourse to only one perspective of this complex and nuanced matter.
We take this opportunity to clarify the rules we live by.
As journalists, we hold close our commitment to the truth. As opinion writers and editors, we pursue a host of ideologically diverse perspectives, wielding facts to construct different arguments. And as students, we are informed by the community we are a part of, holding ourselves and its members accountable to the truth with knowledge that it can effect tangible, meaningful change.
We trust that our readers will critically evaluate our content, place them in conversation with one another and alongside relevant facts, and come to their own perspectives accordingly. The Crimson has always striven for a diverse and balanced perspective on the Editorial page; we will continue to seek out opinions that challenge one another and speak to the expanse of intelligent, critical, and powerful members of the Harvard community and beyond. We have a responsibility as journalists to fulfill these obligations to our readers and to our staff who will move this industry forward long after we leave 14 Plympton Street. We must do so with integrity.
We are disappointed that attacks on journalism nationally have clouded conversation regarding civil discourse, free speech, and diversity of opinion on campus. The role of a newspaper is to foster dialogue among its readers and serve as a jumping-off point for discussion. It is not to stifle debate, but rather to foster it from a multitude of perspectives.
For 146 years, we have published a newspaper. For 108 years, we have come together as an Editorial Board, scrutinizing sources and facts to hold those in power accountable for their actions through meaningful commentary.
We strive to live up to these ideals every day as we carry on the legacy of this organization — today, tomorrow, and every day moving forward.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

Government Professor Sidney Verba ’53 — an expert in comparative politics, a leader in library organization, and a creator of policy compromises — died March 4 in his Cambridge home at the age of 86.
Verba, a prolific scholar who wrote more than 20 books, joined Harvard's faculty in 1973 and served in a variety of University positions over the course of the next 30 years. His research spanned the topics of American politics, international relations, and political methodology, with a focus on comparative politics and citizen participation.
Prior to working at Harvard, Verba taught at Princeton, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago. Verba’s early studies with his mentor Gabriel A. Almond involved interviews in the United States, Germany, Mexico, Italy, and the United Kingdom, resulting in their 1963 book “The Civic Culture,” which “more or less invented the field of comparative political behavior,” according to Boston College Political Science Professor Kay L. Schlozman.
Verba and Almond’s book explored what they termed “the political culture of participation.” Verba later went on to co-author “Voice and Equality,” in which he outlined the obstacles in American society that prevented citizens from fully participating in the country’s democracy.
Government Department Chair Professor Jennifer L. Hochschild called his contributions a “foundational teaching,” recalling that one of his works was cited more than 1,100 times in subsequent scholarly writings.
“He’s a Stakhanovite worker,” Schlozman, who collaborated with Verba on a number of books, said.
Schlozman added that her experiences working with him were “fabulous” and a “total privilege.”
“He was the senior collaborator on many pieces for decades, and he always did more than his share, and he never was unwilling to do kind of the nuts and bolts work,” she said. “He wasn’t afraid to do the kind of hands on work that really good research requires.”
Verba launched himself into a variety of different jobs at the University in addition to his political science research, leading various University committees that made policy decisions.
“Anytime there’s a kind of a complicated bureaucratic or substantive issue in the University, one president after the other would appoint a Verba committee to solve the problem,” Hochschild said.
When the University administration in 2003 wanted to create a more unified calendar that would streamline the schedules of its different schools, Verba chaired the committee. The Committee on Calendar Reform made many of the changes that continue to affect the rhythm of the school year, including the requirement that fall semester final exams take place prior to winter recess.
History Professor Lizabeth Cohen — who was a member of the committee — called it “one of the most contentious committees I ever served on in my twenty-plus years at Harvard.” Though the discussion involved a lot of conflicting interests, Verba found a way to diffuse the tension, according to Cohen.
“With a large dose of common sense and his irrepressible sense of humor, Sid shepherded a room full of stubborn and resistant committee members toward common ground — and ultimately a common calendar,” she wrote in an email.
Schlozman — who authored multiple books with Verba — also remembered his use of jokes in other instances to “diffuse any tension” and quotes from Shakespeare to “define the situation.”
“He could understand where everyone was coming from, he made sure that all the voices were heard,” she said.
Verba played a role in some of the University’s initial efforts to investigate the prevalence of sexual assault on campus. He surveyed undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty members in 1983, gathering information about attitudes towards assault, harassment by peers, and harassment by non-peers. He included a section about potential remedies to the issue of assault.
“He was more on top of this issue than probably anybody. Took it very seriously,” Hochschild said.
Verba also served in the position of University Library director for more than 20 years, after his appointment by then-University-President Derek C. Bok in 1984. Though Verba had used the library system to conduct research, he had not had prior experience working in and leading the library system. Nevertheless, “he made a very conscious decision that he was going to make the library his prime interest,” according to Deanna B. Marcum, a former associate librarian at the Library of Congress and who worked with Verba in the Council on Library Resources.
Verba was “forward-looking,” according to Marcum, and he assisted in the development of HOLLIS — Harvard’s online library catalogue — and invited workers from Google to digitize some of Harvard’s resources.
“In many ways, I think his most significant contribution to the library world is that he… moved Harvard from an insular organization to be part of the research library community,” Marcum said.
Verba was an advocate for libraries throughout the country, and he testified before Congress about the number of books falling apart in the nation’s research libraries and about the libraries’ need for federal funding.
“He was able to connect with the Congressmen, so I left thinking, Sid Verba can make everyone feel valued and welcome, and important,” Marcum, who observed the testimony, said. “And that’s a pretty great skill to have.”
Verba held his position as University Library director until his retirement in 2007, but he continued to be active in the Government Department. He retained his office in the Center for Government and International Studies building, meeting with students and working on his book “The Unheavenly Chorus” — which he co-authored with Schlozman and Henry E. Brady.
He sent notes to Hochschild each year, saying that he would be willing to give up his office to newer faculty if necessary.
“Of course, we would never have done that. I would have given up my office before I asked him to leave,” Hochschild said. “But again, it was just a very thoughtful gesture… Nobody else has done that.”
Hochschild said that Verba’s hospitality toward her and her family made her feel welcome when starting at Harvard. She remembered how he and his wife invited her family over to celebrate the holiday of Passover.
“He was really important,” she said. “Both his scholarship and his presence.”

{image id=1326714 size=large byline=TRUE caption="Former President of France François Hollande spoke at the Harvard Kennedy School this weekend.}
Former President of France François Hollande delivered the closing remarks for the 2019 European Conference which took place at the Harvard Kennedy School this weekend, calling for the creation of a “new Europe.”
The European Conference is a seven-year-old tradition and is organized by students from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts, the Kennedy School, the Business School, and the College. The theme of this year’s conference was “Europe: Dialogue with Dissent,” and the weekend featured panels and workshops that covered topics ranging from artificial intelligence to European Union elections. The topic of this year’s conference was prompted by the “plurality of crises” that Europe has faced in the last year, including an “economic and financial crisis” and “the blurring of traditional political lines,” according to the conference’s webpage.
Hollande, president of France between 2012 and 2017, began his speech by highlighting the “resilience” of the European Union. He referred to the strength of the euro and the ability of the EU to handle its split with the United Kingdom, which Hollande said “could have been the the beginning of the end.”
Hollande then transitioned into Europe’s weaknesses, calling attention to the EU’s “stagnant” state both in terms of its policies and organization of its defense. He also spoke about the rise of divisions — both north-south and east-west — within Europe.
“The risk for Europe now is to be stopped from the divisions inside,” Hollande said in an interview with The Crimson.
The former French president also discussed how the “European dream” has changed over the past century and how the “European dream” of today is somewhat unclear. He said that two generations ago, Europe was “synonymous with peace.”
“In my generation, Europe was democracy,” Hollande said. “It was the possibility not just to live in peace but in freedom from Portugal all the way to Poland. We reached that dream. But for your generation, what is that dream?”
Hollande said that the “European dream” of today could be founded on promoting ecology, developing “favorable social model[s],” or encouraging increased citizen involvement in democracy.
The second half of his speech focused on exploring possibilities for the future of the European Union. Hollande said his preferred path would be to create a “new Europe within Europe” which would be founded on a relationship between France and Germany.
“If we want to go forward, if we want to have new objectives and new projects, we must choose [this] way,” Hollande said in an interview with The Crimson. “It is to have a union between Germany and France, the more important countries, and to have new steps in the building of Europe. Among those attempts, we have ecology, energy, security, and defense.”
Hollande said that while in the past, it might have been difficult for France and Germany to agree on political matters, he believes there is greater possibility today for their collaboration.
“We think it’s possible to gather France and Germany first and afterward we can ask the other countries to come,” Holland said in his speech, referring to this new Europe.
But without an initial agreement or relationship between France and Germany, Hollande said, it will be “impossible to create a new Europe.”
“The European debate [today] is fundamentally different,” Hollande said in closing his speech. “It’s no longer about changing such-and-such institution, welcoming such-and-such country, or preserving the ones that are leaving. It’s about defining a new Europe, a new project, and a new ideal for the world.”

Students at the Harvard Kennedy School gathered to protest the impending termination of Lecturer Steve Jarding — who teaches one of the school’s most popular courses — at the John F. Kennedy Jr. forum Thursday.
In December, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf confirmed that Jarding could only hold his lectureship through May 2020, according to emails provided by Jarding. This sparked outcry from Kennedy School students and alumni who felt they had benefited from Jarding’s teaching. Organizing efforts since then culminated in Thursday’s rally, at which organizers handed out t-shirts emblazoned with the words “Keep Jarding” and encouraged students to sign a petition in protest.
A spokesperson for Elmendorf declined to comment Thursday, saying that Elmendorf was on vacation until this week, and did not respond to a further request for comment Friday.
Jarding is well-known for leading Democracy, Politics, and Institutions 890: “The Making of a Politician,” in which students are taught communication skills for public speaking, interviews, and debates. Students at the rally said Jarding’s course stands out among the hundreds offered at the Kennedy School.
“When I was applying to the Harvard Kennedy School, I wrote in my application that I wanted to take the class,” said Elizabeth G. Gibbons, a current student of Jarding’s who gave a speech at the rally. “There is no other class on this campus that is so personally tailored to making you a better writer, communicator, someone who can deliver a speech well — there’s nothing like it.”
Jarding — who has taught at the Kennedy School for 16 years — said he was reviewed for a promotion to senior lecturer in 2017. As part of that process, he was considered by two committees, the first of which voted him forward, and the second of which voted not to advance him to the new role. Jarding said someone “slipped the [first committee’s] report under my door.” The second committee is not known to have produced a report summarizing its findings, and therefore it is unclear why they voted that way.
Typically, if people are not voted in favor of a promotion, they are terminated from their existing lectureship, Jarding said. In his case, Elmendorf created a special designation that would allow him to remain as a lecturer for a renewed three-year period without a guarantee of promotion review at the end.
In December 2018, however, Jarding said Elmendorf asked him to depart at the conclusion of the 2019 academic year. Follow-up emails provided by Jarding indicate that he reminded Elmendorf of his allowance to stay through 2020, which Elmendorf confirmed as Jarding’s latest possible departure time and agreed to honor. Elmendorf wrote to Jarding that he would not be eligible for another review in 2020.
Jarding said that his termination was untimely, considering the high interest in his course.
“I probably get 50 to 60 students a year who come to me and say, ‘I am here because of you, I came to this school because of you,’” Jarding said. “It’s weird, at a time when there is more demand for this course than ever.”
The Kennedy School uses a bidding system for overenrolled courses. Each student is allotted 1000 bidding points per year that they may use toward classes where the enrollment is above capacity. 986 bidding points were required to enter Jarding’s class this semester, Jarding said. He indicated that this puts the course at one of the highest bid levels for any course at the school.
“I turn away a couple hundred students per semester from it, I take 56,” Jarding said of the popularity of his course.
At Thursday’s rally, Kennedy School student Kojo Frempong talked about the positive impact Jarding has had on him.
“I say to people all the time that Professor Jarding changed my life,” Frempong said. “Jarding gives you techniques, he gives you an ability to be able to express what you feel, he gives you an ability to be able to communicate to people, and that’s why I say Jarding changed my life.”
Jarding came to Harvard in spring 2004 as an IOP Fellow before accepting a lectureship that fall. In addition to teaching, Jarding does general campaign consulting and media training with politicians in the United States and around the world.
“The saddest part is that I love this place,” Jarding said. “I have nothing but praise for wanting to do what’s right by this school, and the students here are fabulous.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 12, 2019 at 3:38 p.m.
The Undergraduate Council signed a statement Sunday in support of the graduate student union’s efforts to ensure that their new contract with the University includes an option for union members to seek third-party grievance procedures to address sexual harassment issues.
Because Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers represents over 400 undergraduate student workers, Mather House Representative Sanika S. Mahajan ’21, Dunster House Representative Janani Krishnan-Jha ’20, and Ivy Yard Representative Jenny Y. Gan ’22 sponsored a bill to sign a statement in favor of third-party grievance processes. Such processes allow complainants to seek help from organizations outside of Harvard to resolve issues of sexual harassment and discrimination.
“The administration has proposed carving potential protections for harassment and discrimination out of student workers’ first union contract,” the statement reads. “We reject this proposal. We stand united to demand the administration agree to a fair and neutral grievance procedure for harassment and discrimination in this historic contract for HGSU-UAW.”
The third-party organization that would adjudicate such issues would likely be the American Arbitration Association, and costs associated with arbitration would be split equally between the union and the University, according to Lisa L. Xu, a staff organizer for the union who attended the Sunday meeting.
Union members who suffer other grievances, such as lack of pay, are eligible to undergo third-party arbitration under the current draft of the contract. Xu said one reason the University has given for opposing the inclusion of sexual harassment and discrimination issues in third-party grievance procedures was that the University has already worked to strengthen its own offices responsible for overseeing such issues.
“Their stated reason is that they invested a lot into improving Title IX. They don’t want us to bypass their procedures, but we’re not suggesting a bypass at all,” Xu said. “You can simultaneously file a Title IX and a union grievance. We think they are potentially scared of the reputational consequences if students access the system because they might have more confidence in it because it is a neutral third party who is making the decisions at the end of the day.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement that the University handles claims of sexual assault and discrimination using policies that have received "extensive" input from Harvard affiliates.
"A single system, not one carved out only for unionized student workers, is how the University can best ensure the safety and well-being of all students," Swain wrote. "What HGSU-UAW has proposed would place many complainants and respondents, along with those who may have been witnesses to the event(s) in question, face-to-face in an adversarial arbitration hearing, potentially with lawyers and cross-examination, something the University does not believe is appropriate for these important, complex and sensitive issues.”
Third-party arbitrators would also not have the legal power to punish any faculty, students, or employees found guilty of misconduct, according to Swain.
Some UC representatives said they wanted to hear the University’s point-of-view before passing a statement condemning their decisions.
“I just don’t think it’s good practice to vote on statements when we haven’t heard both sides of the argument,” said UC Secretary Cade S. Palmer ’20, who is also a former Crimson Sports Chair.
The bill also contained clauses calling on the UC to publicize a #TimesUp rally that the union will host Wednesday and to support a union petition to demand more bargaining time with the University. The union has met with Harvard administrators approximately every two weeks since negotiations began in October 2018.
The council ultimately voted to pass the legislation 20-9-1. In doing so, they joined dozens of other organizations in signing the statement, including the Harvard College Democrats, Harvard College Disability Alliance, Our Harvard Can Do Better, and the Student Labor Action Movement. The Graduate Student Council also approved a resolution declaring its support for the union’s proposed grievance procedures.
The UC also announced at the Sunday meeting that reduced rates for Lyft rides will roll out to students this week after it spent months planning a partnership with the ride-sharing service.
“We went into this partnership really trying to identify the transportation gaps and see how a pilot program with Lyft, in particular, could help fill in those gaps,” UC President Sruthi Palaniappan ’20 said.
In the first phase of the partnership, Lyft will offer five rides for a flat rate of $3.50 to a maximum of 2000 students. In the second phase, which will begin in April, Lyft will offer students $10 off on one late-night ride between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. from Thursday through Saturday.
At the end of April, the UC will present data regarding both phases of the pilot program to administrators in the hopes of formalizing an official partnership with Lyft, according to Palaniappan.
The UC also considered issuing a statement in support of rehiring Harvard School of Public Health security guard Joseph G. Bartuah, who was terminated from his post Feb. 27. The University has said Bartuah was terminated because he left his post unattended, whereas Bartuah alleges his termination was in retaliation for complaints he sent to his supervisors raising workplace concerns.
The council voted to table discussion of the statement until its next meeting to give its members more time to review the evidence — including interviews with involved parties and email records — surrounding the issue.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations held its annual Cultural Rhythms Show honoring Janet Mock, an acclaimed writer, producer, director, and transgender rights advocate, in Sanders Theater Saturday.
Cultural Rhythms showcases and celebrates Harvard’s cultural and ethnic diversity, according to the foundation’s website. This year’s show also featured 12 performances by students and cultural groups.
“The vision was ‘Reclamation,’” Hakeem O. I. Angulu ’20, the show’s 2019 director, said in an interview. “Cultural Rhythms has long-been described as like a festival, but I wanted to turn that on its head this year and refocus on our efforts on making sure that the performers and that students in general feel that this space is for them.”
The day’s programming began in the Kirkland House Junior Common Room with a Q&A with Mock, the foundation’s 2019 Artist of the Year.
Mock made history last year as the first transgender woman of color to write, direct and produce a television series. The show, an FX drama entitled POSE, assembled the largest cast of transgender actors in regular roles for a scripted series ever.
“Her life and career is all about taking up space in rooms and places that were not built for her, or sitting beside people who would prefer to not work with her,” Angulu, who selected Mock, said. “But she still goes there in those spaces and reclaims those spaces, and that’s amazing work.”
During the Q&A, Mock spoke frequently about intersectionality, specifically the “complicatedness” of her identity as a black, native indigenous Hawaiian, transgender woman and how she reflects that in her art.
“I grew up like so many of us engaging with media, watching television, watching films, engaging with music, and not necessarily seeing myself in my totality reflected,” she said. “And so, so much of my work has been about telling my own truth, largely out of an act of not being seen or reflected.”
Following the Q&A, FUSIAN, an “East Asian-interest” a capella group, performed at a luncheon in Kirkland Dining Hall, singing a mash-up of Coldplay’s “Yellow” and "Liu Xing" — the Mandarin version of “Yellow.”
At 4 p.m., an audience gathered in Sanders Theater to watch the student performances. Following each performance, representatives from the performing groups had the chance to speak about the personal significance of their art.
Emmy Semprun ’22 opened the show with a flamenco dance from Spain.
“Cultural Rhythms for me is not only about presenting your culture but how you identify with it,” Semprun said in an interview after the show. “There are plenty of other Hispanic people who could also dance flamenco but could interpret it in a really different way, so I think it’s really beautiful that I got to share my specific interpretation.”
The other performers included groups who had been in previous Cultural Rhythms shows as well as groups new to the stage, including Abyssinia, an East African dance group.
“The Ethiopian-Eritrean community had some trouble centralizing, and I think this was an event that really brought all of us together,” said Aaron Abai ’22, a Cultural Rhythms Dialogue co-director who also performed with Abyssinia.
Cultural Rhythms concluded Sunday afternoon with an event for all performers and crew in Kirkland Junior Common Room, where they enjoyed food and heard short speeches of gratitude from Foundation interns.
The afternoon gathering marked the first year that such an event took place. In past years, cultural groups served food for rest of the student body in a buffet-style food festival, according to Angulu.
“I didn’t think that aligned very well with our mission,” Angulu said. “We decided this year to serve the cultural groups instead.”
Abai said he appreciated the opportunity Cultural Rhythms gives students to share and celebrate their culture onstage.
“It gives space and gives a huge visible space to a lot of groups who otherwise would not have the chance to show off their identity and their culture,” he said.

The Harvard College Women’s Center hosted its 13th annual Women’s Week, featuring 10 student-led events with the theme “Power Through,” last week.
Programming included open mic events, film screenings, and discussions with guest speakers, and the events covered topics ranging from “Empowering Women in STEM” to the “10th Annual Feminist Coming Out Day.”
“The goal of Women's Week is to collaborate with students across campus to celebrate women’s achievements, promote dialogue about women’s and gender issues, and highlight the varied and intersectional experiences of women at Harvard and beyond,” Christie A. Jackson ’21, the Women’s Center intern who led this year’s Design and Publicity team, wrote in an email.
The Women’s Center partnered with a number of organizations on campus to host programming. The Harvard Project for Asian and International Relations was one of more than a dozen campus groups that hosted or co-hosted events during the week. On March 4, the first day of events, HPAIR hosted a discussion event titled “Women Throughout Asia: The Gender Experience in IR” featuring Harvard Kennedy School student Victoria Chia as a guest speaker.
This year marked the first year that HPAIR participated in Women’s Week, according to Shivam A. Bhatt ’20, the organization’s executive director of external relations.
“Coming to the steering committee meetings that we have with the Women’s Center through the planning process, you got to see how so many different groups across campus are really trying to contribute to the dialogue and the discussion,” Bhatt said. “We came with the approach of women and international relations, and how the gender experience plays out there.”
The South Asian Association also hosted a March 5 event entitled “SAA Celebrates South Asian Motherhood,” featuring a call-a-thon, an iPhone polaroid that printed photographs of participants’ maternal figures, and an impromptu discussion.
Rameen A. Rana ’20, one of the group’s co-presidents, cited this discussion — in which a dozen students struck up an unexpectedly personal conversation on the sacrifices and love of their mothers — as one of her favorite SAA events of the year.
“I used to think that a measure of success for an SAA event was how many people were there, and if the room was super full and busy,” Rana said. “But I think this was one of the first events where that was definitely not why I thought the event was a success.”
Rana also said that she appreciated the opportunity that Women’s Week presented for participants to converse freely and “forget all ‘psets,’ forget all quizzes and tests, and just talk about our moms.”
Other events throughout the week included a screening of “The Devil Wears Prada” hosted by the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, as well as a panel about transitioning historically single-gender musical groups on campus to gender-inclusive spaces hosted by the Radcliffe Choral Society, Harvard Glee Club, and Harvard Din & Tonics, according to a Facebook page for the event.
Jackson named “the diversity of programming” as her favorite aspect of the 2019 Women’s Week and said she anticipates consistent change and adaptation for this annual event in future years.
“Every year there are new themes, new events, and sometimes new Women's Center interns leading the programming,” Jackson wrote. “Women's Week is always changing and evolving to provide the campus what it needs that year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty-two Harvard Law School professors signed a letter supporting their fellow Professor and Winthrop House Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. as he faces on-campus scrutiny following his decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
Law School professors Janet E. Halley and Elizabeth Bartholet ’62 organized the effort, sending a draft to other professors and faculty clinicians early last week. Fifty-two faculty members — including Professor Emeritus Alan M. Dershowitz, former Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow, and Professor Laurence H. Tribe — signed on to the document, and the resulting letter was published in the Boston Globe on Friday.
The letter itself does not mention Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein, though an editor’s note contextualizes Sullivan’s decision to represent Weinstein and the resulting protests on campus.
“We call upon our university’s Administration to recognize that such legal advocacy in service of constitutional principles is not only fully consistent with Sullivan’s roles of law professor and dean of an undergraduate house, but one of the many possible models that resident deans can provide in teaching, mentoring, and advising students,” the letter reads.
On Jan. 23, the New York Post first reported that Sullivan would be joining Weinstein’s legal team as the film producer faces five criminal charges in a Manhattan sexual abuse case, stemming from allegations that he raped a woman and forcibly performed oral sex on another.
Two days after the Post story, Sullivan emailed Winthrop House residents defending his decision to represent Weinstein, saying that defense attorneys have a duty to represent the “unpopular defendant.” Days later, Sullivan and co-Faculty Dean Stephanie R. Robinson followed up with another missive — this time outlining “processes” that would be in place going forward, including the appointment of Resident Dean Linda D.M. Chavers as the “point person” for issues pertaining to sexual assault.
In the weeks following Sullivan’s announcement, he has faced sharp criticism from students and faculty alike. More than 50 students toting signs that read “Do Your Job” and “Remove Sullivan” protested outside Massachusetts Hall on Feb. 11, calling for the College to remove Sullivan from his Faculty Dean position. That same day, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay called his response to students’ concerns “insufficient” in an interview with The Crimson.
On Feb. 25, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that former Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 would head a “climate review” of Winthrop House in the wake of student criticism.
In addition to voicing support for Sullivan’s defense of Weinstein, the law professors’ letter also criticized any potential University pressure on Sullivan to resign.
“We view any pressure by Harvard’s administration for him to resign as Faculty Dean of Winthrop, because of his representation or speaking on behalf of clients, as inconsistent with the University’s commitment to the freedom to defend ideas, however unpopular,” the letter reads.
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment.
Halley said she was motivated to circulate the letter by her disappointment with the University’s response to student criticism. She said she felt that the climate review, specifically, was “shocking in its ridiculousness.”
“The question should not be ‘can Ronald Sullivan continue as House Dean,’ it’s how, as a great university, can we convene a discussion about strongly contested matters like the ones involved here,” Halley said. “They’ve just shied away from their role as academic leaders.”
Bartholet wrote in an email that she was also concerned with Harvard’s response, especially in light of Sullivan’s history of “representation of victims of criminal and social injustice.” Sullivan has represented high-profile defendants in the past including former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in his double murder trial and the family of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014.
“They just can’t accept being associated in any way with the defense of those accused of sexual harassment,” Bartholet wrote of Harvard’s administration.
Halley said she hopes the letter will prompt readers to consider the professors’ perspective.
“For his career to be besmirched by a decision that he’s not fit to be the dean of Winthrop House — it would be such a miscarriage,” Halley said. “I truly hope that’s not the outcome of this process.”

You know it’s spring at Harvard when all anyone can talk about is panicking over summer program application deadlines, getting wrecked by pre-Spring Break midterms, and anticipating Housing Day. Check out this Flyby-approved list of some of the best blocking group names from the Class of 2022!
block and roll (like rock and roll)
A classic pun. We also appreciate the explanation — nearly missed the joke there.
Block Dirty To Me
As hardcore Jason Derulo fans, we are ~living~ for the song reference.
Dean Khurana's phone number
The one thing that everyone wants. We’re curious, though — does a name like this increase your chances of getting a Quad House?
Does this spark joy?
This name absolutely does, and we’re hoping your Housing Day will too.
hollaBLOCK girls
Our favorite bop of the mid-2000s rolled into a blocking pun? Yes, please.
It's 5 O'Block Somewhere
Though there are quite a few puns with the word “block”, this is the perfect blend of classic and original. Good work, y’all.
Lawrence S. Blockow
Please link with “Dean Khurana’s phone number” and bring our favorite Harvard bromance to life.
Shuttle Asian Traits & Subtle Asian Blocking
Your favorite Facebook page forever immortalized in a blocking group name. Hopefully you get the Quad or Mather so you can make use of that aforementioned shuttle on the daily.
STAYK AND LOIBSTAH ONLY HEEUH FOH A LEEMITED TOIME
This name had us cackling for days on end. Good work, you meme-loving lunatics, and props for being willing to step outside of the “blocking” pun world.
With the excitement (and drama) of blocking in the rear view window, all that’s left now is to wait in anticipation for the one and only Housing Day. For now, though, keep flexing your oh-so-clever blocking group names while they’re still relevant.

With midterms in the air, no one loves to complain more than the STEM kids in our lives. This holds especially true for those poor pre-med students and procrastinators alike who gathered last Monday for the LS1b midterm. We sent a reporter to witness the pre-exam fun.
“I have one pencil that actually works...”
Ah yes, we’re back at that point in the semester where we have exactly one pencil to our name, and any papers we get are just shoved into our backpacks. Not even the impending doom of a midterm can motivate us to toss an extra pencil into our backpack before walking into the exam room. Spring break really can’t come soon enough!
“Does anyone have an extra calculator?” “Yes, but it’s a small baby.”
They really weren’t kidding. Imagine hoping for that TI-84 of your dreams, and instead getting one that fits in the palm of your hand. I’m not sure what kind of math happens during these midterms, but hopefully for the sake of this poor soul it wasn’t anything that requires more than a “baby” calculator.
*Quietly slides a succulent into their bag as the test is starting*
A good luck charm? A gift? One last reminder of happiness before a terrible exam? Not sure if more or less context would make this better, but either way this is probably one of the best test-taking strategies I’ve seen. Remind me to grab a small houseplant on the way to my next midterm.
“I just threw up in my mouth.”
You know, I feel for you. LS1b seems like a tough time. Would I be feeling like this if I had to take it? Probably. But to be fair, you did sign up for this. Maybe try to avoid the whole throwing up thing though — I can’t imagine that would be good for your Scantron.
Judging by these comments, I’m really not sure how well this midterm went for these poor pre-meds. But all jokes aside, to our future doctors, don’t let one #yikes of a midterm get you down. And to the rest of you, here’s hoping that your midterms are a lot less stressful.

“Floreat domus de Eliot!” If you’re lucky enough to get sorted into Eliot House, you’ll be hearing this Latin phrase, which roughly translates to “Long Flourish Eliot House,” a lot. Eliot House overlooks the Charles River, which is as glorious as it is romantic. With its annual (and coveted) Fête spring formal, courtyard access to the Charles, and vibrant community, you can only hope that you’ll be hearing “E-L-I-O-T, you just won the lottery!” this housing day.
Sophomore housing at Eliot is typically composed of n-1 rooms. Every suite in Eliot is “slightly unique,” so you’ll have a one-of-a-kind experience no matter what, according to House Committee co-chair Will S. Flanagan ’20, who is also a Crimson News Executive. HoCo co-chair Terzah M. Hill ’20 assures us that Eliot housing for sophomores is actually pretty decent; they want you to love Eliot from the get-go!
The courtyard seems to be the talk of the town at Eliot; it’s a beautiful space to lounge, hang out with your friends, or study when the weather gets warmer. If you’re sorted into Eliot House, you should look forward to the river views from “the best courtyard,” according to Eliotite Gabriella M. Lombardo ’20. Eliot custodian José Portillo agrees, saying that one of his favorite spaces in the House is the courtyard in the summertime.
Unlike other River West houses, Eliot’s courtyard has direct access to Memorial Drive. Only Eliot residents have swiping privileges from the courtyard to the river, so you can definitely weirdly flex on your friends when you say, “we don’t have to go through JFK St., I’ve got swipe” on your way across the river
Location is also key — what’s a courtyard worth if you aren’t within walking distance of your fave places? Eliot Intramurals Chair Matthew D. Spence ’20 raves about proximity to the athletic complex as one of Eliot’s best features. If you’re an athlete, you live and breathe the Institute of Politics, or you simply want to shop at the Allston Trader Joe’s all the time, then you and Eliot are a match made in heaven.
Community is quite possibly the most important aspect of being an Eliotite. The dining hall is a hallmark of community-building — with faculty dinners, formals, meals, and regular ole’ studying going on, there’s a special love that students grow to have for the Eliot dhall.
Fête is Eliot’s annual spring formal, but as all Eliot residents know, it’s more than just a spring formal; it’s a way of life. Fête consumes the thoughts of Eliotites and eludes those who are not in Eliot: Will they be able to get a +1 ticket? Fête spans two diverse spheres: the old and the new. Hill says that there’s a “vintage vibe” with swing dancing and a live band playing outside, while a DJ fosters more of a “club atmosphere” indoors.
Steins are the pinnacle of all things Eliot: vibrant and fancy. They often have live bands at steins, and according to Hill, the steins are well-attended by Eliotites. Flanagan recalls a special karaoke stein, where people stayed well past the event’s end time.
Faculty deans, Harvard University Dining Services staff, and resident tutors are also an essential component of community at Eliot. Lombardo speaks of the close personal relationships that are formed in Eliot, not just with other students but with everybody that makes Eliot House not just a house but a home. According to Eliotite Gustavo O. Coutinho ’21, the Eliot Harvard University Dining Services staff is the best dhall staff, as they genuinely care about the students at Eliot. When asked to compare their faculty deans, Douglas "Doug" A. Melton and Gail O’Keefe, to superheroes, both Flanagan and Hill agreed on Superman and Wonder Woman, respectively. Eliot’s faculty deans work day and night to foster community in the House, and it shines through in the appreciation that Eliotites have for them.
Flanagan says that the EBC, Eliot Boat Club, doubles as the Eliot Breakfast Club. After morning practice, the EBC has a tradition of grabbing breakfast together at the dhall, so keep an eye out for your local intramural celebrities if you do get sorted into Eliot! Hill mentions IMs as a casual way to get Eliotites together, and since intramurals are as fun as the people who participate in them, that means they’re always a good time at Eliot.
We got the HoCo chairs to give us the inside scoop on life in Eliot.
If you had to describe Eliot in three words, what would they be?
TH: Domus (It’s Latin for ‘House’)
WF: Community
Both: Iconic
If you had to change one thing about Eliot, what would it be?
WF: I would make it so that I could live here more than three years.
If Eliot House were a Vine, which one would it be?
TH: ‘Oh my god, I love Chipotle’... it’s iconic because I feel like that’s how a lot of people feel about Eliot, like ‘Oh my god, I love Eliot’.

“It’s really easy to fall in love with Winthrop” according to House Committee co-chair Sofia I. Garcia ’20. From the meditation room and grille to the infectious house pride (#ThropLove), recently renovated Winthrop House boasts not only one of the biggest student populations but also one of the most vibrant communities. With a thriving social calendar, incredible amenities, a lack of hallway doubles, and babies and puppies galore, Winthrop is a true gem. 
With no hallway doubles (ever!), Winthrop’s sophomore housing is some of the best at Harvard. “Sophomore housing tends to be a trickle-down from whatever junior suites don’t get taken, as well as hallway singles,” says Garcia, noting that “it’s a pretty even mix of both.” Students can anticipate either sharing a double within a suite of four or six people complete with a spacious common room, or claiming one of the hallway singles located around the house. “It’s very split, says HoCo co-chair Fotini Anastopoulos ’20. “A lot of people get suites, and a lot of people get hallway singles.” With no designated area for sophomores, students can expect to share a hall with people from all years, promoting a strong sense of shared community.
Beyond the incredible sophomore housing, Winthrop boasts a meditation room, a gym, a spacious library, and a fifth floor common room with floor-to-ceiling windows displaying an incredible view of the river. Craving a late night snack? “We have a very nice grille that’s not in a basement,” Anastopoulos says, laughing. One of the defining spaces in the house is the dining hall, according to Winthrop student Lindey Kneib ’20. “You can see absolutely everyone in here,” she says.
“The community here is top-notch, one of the best,” gushes Winthrop resident Theresa Manivanh ’20. “I walk in and I know the security guard, I know the dining hall staff, and I know most of the people in my dining hall.” This sense of house bonding and pride extends to all parts of Winthrop. Incoming students will have a smorgasbord of events to look forward to, from Throptoberfest, Winthrop’s premiere “fall bash,” to Arbella Ball, Winthrop’s fancy spring formal. Winthrop’s faculty deans also truly encourage community bonding, introducing Music and Mingle last year, in which they invite artists to give live performances and provide trays of food for students to munch on as they relax and listen.
Wellness and fitness are also a major focus of Winthrop. “We do House yoga on Wednesday nights in the fancy common room,” says Garcia, “and [we have] meditation sessions every week.” Winthrop Bootcamp is a new amenity that allows students to participate in guided workouts twice a week. “We have a strong wellness community,” explains Garcia.
Not sold yet? “We have a bunch of cute puppies and babies that we all take care of,” Anastopoulos says, and students may even get the chance to babysit these smaller members of the house. This playful and cheery environment permeates all aspects of Winthrop, from house-wide “Throplove” support emails to memes hanging throughout the house promoting house events. A program called Women of Winthrop promotes community bonding every week through a variety of activities and outings, from bringing in masseuses and nail technicians for a spa day, to chocolate and brewery tastings, to treating students to “high tea at the Taj [hotel].” Winthrop truly does the most for its students.
Garcia and Anastopoulos spilled all the tea on what makes Winthrop the superior house:
If Winthrop was a Hogwarts House, what House would it be?
FA: Oh, Gryffindor. I feel like the personalities in this house just match the personalities of people you would expect to be sorted into Gryffindor.
Can you describe Winthrop in three words?
SG: Lions Gotta Eat. [laughs] That’s our motto.
What is the one thing you would want freshmen to know about Winthrop?
SG: There’s so many things.
FA: Welcome to the best three years of your life. We love you; we’re so excited to have you.

Kirkland House is one of the smaller Houses on campus, but what they may lack in numbers, they certainly make up for in House spirit (and puppies)! Yes, that’s right: puppies! Kirkland is notorious for its abundance of dogs, so you’re sure to feel at home with these furry friends running around.
For sophomores, rooms in Kirkland closely resemble freshman housing, albeit slightly better. Each year, room layouts also improve to become more spacious. Sophomores can typically expect a double, a single, and a common room for a group of three. Given the close-knit spirit of the House, these cozy and charming room layouts are not at all problematic.
Entryway B of Kirkland even has a suite home to 10 students called the Beef, well known for throwing parties. You grow to know everyone in Kirkland with time, so chances are most people in the House have at least one friend or a friend of a friend who lives in the Beef. In Kirkland, you see people every day and grow with them for three years, HoCo co-chair Julia J. Dokko ’20 wrote in a text. Rising sophomores can look forward to being readily embraced in this welcoming place.
Kirklanders live in a prime location relative to Harvard Yard but never even need to leave the comfort of their House. A basement connects all the entryways (perfect for those lazy winter nights!) and is fully stocked with a kitchen (known as “the Grille”), plush couches, a TV, gym, foosball, billiards, and ping pong. “I have a lot of fond memories there — from working out to loud music with my best friends to hanging out at Stein and eating mozzarella sticks to watching movies and sports on the TV with snacks and great company,” HoCo co-chair Irla Belli ’20 wrote in a text. There’s also an elegant senior common room next to the dining hall, the go-to spot for students to dine, pset, and catch up with friends. Lastly, Kirkland has Hicks House, a piece of Cambridge history which serves as a library where Kirklanders can study and chill. Hicks House also turns into a haunted house when Halloween rolls around.
Kevin R. English ’20, Kirkland House Parliamentarian, sums up his House community in these three words: “Gritty. Spirited. IMs.” Kirklanders are full of pride and passion for their House, and this is truly a distinguishing trait. Starting on Housing Day, rising sophomores are dorm-stormed to the chanting of “Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! You are so good to me. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! You are the place to be. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! Damn you are so fine. Oh Kirkland! Oh Kirkland! Thank God that you are mine.” The House this year is even working on a special video series of song parodies to make a full album for the new Kirklanders.
Winter is definitely the most special season in Kirkland. Secret Santa Week is a longstanding House tradition where students surprise each other with gifts in the forms of experiences, like living out a romantic comedy movie for the day, being read a bedtime story with milk and cookies, or, of course, a puppy playdate. Secret Santa reveals align with a holiday dinner with delicious food where seniors give speeches and toasts about what Kirkland has meant to them. To conclude the festivities, Scott Haywood, building manager, leads a parade around the dining hall holding up a stuffed boar with students following, singing, and playing instruments.
In addition to this, Kirkland goes above and beyond with their bi-weekly steins to foster community. The House is unique for hosting beer, wine, and cheese seminars, dessert open houses with the faculty deans, low-pressure plays put on by the Kirkland Drama Society (with house dean participation!), Monday cookie nights with snacks baked fresh by tutors, senior roasts, and community conversations with notable guest speakers like actor Woody Harrelson. All these small events make Kirklanders proud of their house quirks and traditions. On the very first night, new Kirklanders enter for dinner, and the whole house cheers and claps for them. When describing Kirkland Housing Day, Dokko said, “I knew I found my home and my family.”
If you still aren’t convinced as to why Kirklanders camp out each year (even in blizzards!) to be the first House to place their flag on the John Harvard statue for Housing Day, we got the inside scoop on Kirkland House spirit from HoCo co-chair Julia J. Dokko.
If you had to compare Kirkland to a fruit, which would it be and why?
JD: Grapes, because Kirkland life is like small bubbles of exploding joy. Each day in Kirkland is a new burst of happiness.
If you had to compare Kirkland to a Harry Potter house, which would it be and why?
JD: Kirkland is a good mixture of Gryffindor and Slytherin. Kirklanders are passionate and not afraid to be themselves but can also be a little mischievous.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your House?
JD: You don’t need to do a thing (other than to just show up for Housing Day). If you’re sorted into Kirkland, you are truly blessed. It’s like you’re diving into a pool of happiness and love.
