After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The titular track from Kesha’s new album “High Road” just received a new music video. The vintage video, one that emulates the distortion of an old home movie, begins with a title card resembling that of an old video game, its retro style paralleling portions of the song that channel a youthful cheer with a Kesha twist. “So aggressive, pass-ive aggressive,” she sings.
The video features a mix of somewhat disjointed imagery, from cats meowing to chickens roaming around to Kesha, adorned with a crown, sitting in the bed of a truck that’s been converted to a ball pit. The imagery of a ball pit, the prom queen-esque crown and sash, an athletic trophy, and the song’s childhood rhymes all give the video a sense of nostalgia. Its seemingly random imagery could also be a result of the lyrics, “I’m taking the high road, I’m high as f***,” implying that the high road is not metaphorical but is in fact the pathway where Kesha is less than sober.
This video stands as a representation of both Kesha’s new album and her new persona as an artist. Her music can’t be contained by any singular category, genre, or feeling. Instead, Kesha’s recent music has enabled her to explore a multifaceted approach to her art. The change of her name from Ke$ha to simply Kesha, which occurred before her album “Rainbow” (2017), marked a turning point in her career. Since this iconographic shift from her old artistry to her new, Kesha has redefined the kind of music she creates. This music video perfectly encompasses the unrelenting, exuberant chaos that is the result of that transition.
“High Road” signifies a further shift into a blend between her old style of music and her new trajectory. The track “Kinky” goes so far as to feature “Ke$ha,” the personification of her old self. While Kesha’s music has diverged from her previous discography of mostly “party” music, she’s reabsorbing the fun, felicitous nature of that music into her new identity. Her newest music video, which stands as a representation of this album, perfectly encapsulates the all-over-the-place-ness of her music while honing back in on the excitement of her younger party sound.

Renowned fortepianist Kristian Bezuidenhout made his directorial debut with the Handel and Haydn Society on Valentine’s weekend, performing works by C.P.E. Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. H+H has distinguished themselves as a period orchestra that delivers authentic renditions of classical works. Period orchestras like H+H provide concert-goers with the experience of what a piece might have sounded like centuries ago at the premiere. Chasing a replica of an original performance proves an elusive goal, and any performance nowadays seems to have inescapably modern elements. It is borderline impossible to ensure accurate acoustics for a concert hall in a given era, provide gut strings or baroque bows for string musicians, and find authentic, non-replica instruments. H+H charmed the audience in their original interpretation, but their performance serves as a reminder to consider what might be lost in the quest for authentic period performance.
H+H’s rendition of Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto was true to the time period, but disappointingly so. The fortepiano sounded timid in comparison to the strength and richness of the orchestra. Bezuidenhout’s playing was sensitive and graceful, and the intricate composition of his original cadenza contributed to the authentic period performance. But while the second movement was intimate and subtle, the dainty whispers of the fortepiano did not fill the cavernous performance hall in the first and third movements. The voicing in some of the more complex passages seemed asymmetrical; some interesting harmonic lines didn’t permeate through the fortepiano’s playing. Flashy runs felt muddy and passages that typically set the keyboard ablaze felt restrained. In this case, the cost of authenticity was losing the soul-stirring emotions that more powerful performances of this momentous work (typically on modern pianos) can ignite within audiences.
At the premiere of Beethoven’s Third Piano Concerto, the intimate sound of the fortepiano was a product of the technology of the time. Over the two centuries between then and now, pianos have been engineered to produce clearer, more robust sound. This might not have been the sound that Beethoven would have heard at the premiere, but it is entirely possible that he would have wanted some of the advantages of the modern piano in this concerto. After all, Beethoven was well-known for breaking fortepianos while trying to extract more sound from them. The development of the modern piano presumably arose from a desire to improve upon perceived shortcomings of the fortepiano, among which is the production of a bold sound. Furthermore, in the time since its premiere, audiences have come to expect that this concerto will command the stage, and in this sense, the fortepiano fell short.
The fortepiano was a far better fit for the works in the second half of the concert, where it sparkled in two different pieces by Mozart. Bezuidenhout enthralled the audience with a delicate interpretation of Mozart’s Rondo in A Major, K. 386. The lower strings of H+H played brilliantly and there was a satisfying contrast between the robust solos of the principal cellist, Guy Fishman, and the delicate lines of the fortepiano. Throughout this work, however, there was a nagging feeling that perhaps if this concert were in a smaller concert hall, the fortepiano would have had a greater presence. Nonetheless, the fortepiano was thoroughly enjoyable in this context, and brought a radiant yet intimate timbre that distinguished itself from interpretations of this work on modern instruments.
H+H’s rendition of Mozart’s 36th Symphony demonstrated why they are and should remain a beloved ensemble. Their performance was pristine without feeling sanitized. Period instruments furthered the airy quality of Mozart’s work and the music floated effortlessly through the hall. Every phrase was satisfyingly constructed and crisp. The winds and brass, especially principal bassoonist Andrew Schwartz, were dazzling, although the trumpets were confusingly exiled from the back of the orchestra with their position in between the timpani and basses. In the exuberant final moments of the performance, the joy of the musicians was palpable.
This concert garnered two well-deserved standing ovations from an audience hungry to understand what this music would have sounded like while the composers were alive. Seeking authenticity proves a challenge, and a period performance can be for better, as was the case of Mozart, or for worse, in the case of Beethoven. Utilizing the instruments of a given time period can provide insight into a composer’s life and work, but it can come at the cost of distinct advantages from modern instruments. Sometimes, a performance on period instruments can be uniquely perceptive. Others], antiquated period instruments should not be cause for nostalgia. But regardless, Bezuidenhout and H+H alike gave impassioned and thoughtful performances.

“Hamilton,” the inimitable and original musical that exploded beyond the Broadway bubble and revolutionized both Broadway and American popular culture as we know it, turned five years old this year. In those years, the show has become one of the most discussed musicals of all time and it is still grossing millions of dollars a week. In light of its success, how do we account for its rise to the top — its incredible, unprecedented, meteoric popularity?
Well, it truly was a revolution like nothing seen on the Broadway stage before: “Hamilton” reanimated a familiar story about the ten-dollar founding father to be new, exciting, and modern. “Hamilton” re-introduced hip-hop and R&B to a Broadway stage, helping rejuvenate a traditional industry for a young, modern audience. The show is almost entirely sung through, meaning it is possible to experience the show through the soundtrack without missing key elements of the narrative — making it accessible to those who can’t afford Broadway’s sky-high ticket price.
But it would be impossible to talk about “Hamilton” without speaking about its creator, Lin Manuel Miranda. The massive success of “Hamilton” conferred upon him the mantle of “genius,” building a platform that he certainly does not take for granted — Miranda often utilizes his voice to mobilize people behind causes such as March for Our Lives or the recent earthquakes in Puerto Rico.
“Hamilton” was not Miranda’s first musical. In 2005, Miranda made his debut with the Tony Award-winning “In the Heights,” a unique and electrifying blend of musical styles with Spanish influence. After these two major successes, there has been little indication that Miranda is writing a new show — instead, he has been working in television, film, and other Broadway shows. It is hard to blame him. To top the astronomical success of “Hamilton” seems near impossible. Perhaps Miranda is destined to be an Orson Welles of Broadway — but as is evident from his near-virtuosic tweets, his genius is both undeniable and active. Whether he produces another musical or not, there is little doubt that any work he produces will be nothing short of brilliant.
“Hamilton”’s revolution was of more than just musical style. One of its most important contributions was putting people of color on Broadway, the “Great White Way.” The sentiment behind the casting is to “take back” the story of the founding of America. Having people of color representing a whitewashed history garnered wild attention and critical acclaim in the moment.
Over time, however, the deluge of praise ebbed in favor of important observations about the musical’s political status.
Beyond the misstep of “Hamilton”’s erasure of slavery from its narrative, academic Patricia Herrera pointed to a possibly damaging consequence of the casting of people of color in the play. “Hamilton may also make it difficult for my daughter, and perhaps other youth, to differentiate Angelica Schuyler, the historical figure and slave owner, from Renee Elise Goldsberry, the African American actress personifying Angelica,” Herrera wrote. Though the insistence on putting people of color on a stage that has historically excluded them is commendable, it may also cause issues by “blurring these historical realities” and potentially confuse young people’s perceptions of history.
In light of this, it is possible that “Hamilton” may go the way of “South Pacific,” the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical praised for its progressiveness in 1950 but now widely recognized as having failed to break out of the confines of racist thinking. Ironically, Hamilton quotes South Pacific in “My Shot,” where Burr says “You’ve got to be carefully taught” in reference to a problematic song by that name in “South Pacific.”
So what will be the legacy of “Hamilton” — who will tell its story?

“Hamilton” is an ingenious piece of work, a catalyst for great social dialogue, and has and likely will stand up to the test of time. Five years after its premiere, the musical is a foundational part of culture and dialogue. Recently, John Bolton’s new memoir, highly anticipated for its importance to Trump’s impeachment, was revealed to be titled “The Room Where It Happened” — near-identical to the title of Burr’s climactic song in “Hamilton.” We may look back on it in 50 years with pride or we may cringe, but “Hamilton” has undoubtedly earned its place among the giants of Broadway musicals in history — not as a moment, but as a movement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly four years after the release of its predecessor, “Suicide Squad,” the eighth film in the DC Extended Universe, “Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)” hit theaters on Feb. 7. Coinciding with the release of the movie, Atlantic Records dropped “Birds of Prey: The Album.” With a tracklist featuring Megan Thee Stallion, Halsey, Doja Cat, and the Black Canary herself, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, the soundtrack — like the movie — initially seems all over the place.
Looking at the five singles released ahead of the album, one might not have known what to expect from the soundtrack. Genre-wise, the singles span hip-hop, pop, alternative rock, and rap. The range of styles across the singles made the final album seem as if it was going to be disjointed, choppy, and all-around too much. Despite these initial assumptions, the seemingly-random array of credited artists featured, and any preconceived notions of the soundtrack that stem from reviews of the film, “Birds of Prey: The Album” accomplishes the unexpected. The resulting album is the perfect example of an ambitious collaboration by various artists in different genres done right.
From the start, “Birds of Prey: The Album” hits the ground running. Doja Cat’s “Boss Bitch” opens the album with two minutes and fourteen seconds of fun beats, the rapper’s signature flows, and uplifting lyrics to make anyone feel like a badass — or a boss bitch. The next song, “So Thick” by producer Whipped Cream featuring Baby Goth, embodies self-sufficiency, hard work, and confidence, making it the perfect tune to precede “Diamonds” by Megan Thee Stallion and Normani. A flawless collaboration between two up-and-coming and very powerful artists, “Diamonds” boasts a fun danceable chorus by Normani and Megan Thee Stallion’s confident verses. It is this combination that makes “Diamonds” one of the standout songs on “Birds of Prey: The Album” — a near impossible feat on an album where every song is both different from the last and just as good.
Another highlight from the album, “Experiment on Me” by Halsey, is unlike any other work by the singer. With a heavy guitar, a steady beat, and screamo-style vocals, “Experiment on Me” works well in the context of the album and exhibits Halsey’s versatility as an artist. The next song, “Danger” by Jucee Froot, is one of the more hardcore tracks on the LP. With lyrics about “kicking ass,” strong beats, echoey and screamo vocals, and strong hip-hop and rock influences, “Danger” is one of the best songs on “Birds of Prey: The Album.” Much like “Boss Bitch,” the only downside to “Danger” is that the song is not longer.
“Birds of Prey: The Album” also includes two covers of classic songs. Jurnee Smollett-Bell (Black Canary)’s rendition of James Brown's “It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World” broadcasts Smollett-Bell’s vocal range and is rife with emotion. The closing track on the album, ADONA’s haunting cover of Pat Benatar’s “Hit Me With Your Best Shot,” is perfectly eerie, sensual, and nothing like the original while still paying adequate tribute to Benatar’s hit. With its dramatic instrumentation and ominous vocals, ADONA’s take on a well-known song is a risky move that paid off — this version of “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” was made to be on the soundtrack of a superhero movie and remains the perfect way to wrap up an incredible album.
In line with the film’s emphasis on empowering women and putting their stories at the forefront, “Birds of Prey: The Album” features only women vocalists. The artists featured on the soundtrack exhibit a broad range of musical genres and styles. But despite the drastic differences amid the artists on the album, the cohesive order of the tracklist allowed each song to flow perfectly into the next in terms of style, genre, and lyrical content. Thanks largely to the care put into choosing and ordering its songs, “Birds of Prey: The Album” ends up near perfect — the only negative to the album is that the songs simply are not long enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Woah now, white folk, don’t get defensive too quickly — it’s not about you. Actually, everyone else, that’s really my whole point here — it’s not about them.
One morning I was telling my father that I had been accepted to write this very column, “African, American,” about matters regarding my mixed identity as a black African and American. He shared his congratulations, then lovingly and concernedly shared a warning along with a Toni Morrison quote about racism. A warning to not “get too trapped into black and white,” because, as Morrison says, “the very serious function of racism ... is distraction” from doing meaningful tasks — forcing you to constantly be proving yourself, your culture, your history to somebody else.
My father’s concern — while I graciously appreciate its intentions — caught me off guard, purely because I had not even thought of that. My column was never going to be about “black and white” issues. My column was going to be about and for me, black people, and black issues, though anyone else’s readership and commentary is obviously welcome. In fact, if you look at the style in which I write my other pieces, you will see that they are always addressed to “we”, “us”, and “our”, that is, black people. This piece, itself, is directed at the entire non-white population. I am not concerned with the conflict here. Here, I am concerned about us. Us. And I think that needs to be all of our central focus more often.
I thought of — on that morning I spoke to my father — a little preamble Nina Simone gave in a recording of her song about Lorraine Hansberry, “To Be Young Gifted and Black.” In it, she says to a presumably largely white audience, “now, [the song] is not addressed primarily to white people, though it does not put you down in any way … it simply ignores you.” After the crowd laughs, Nina explained her reasoning: “[her] people need all the inspiration and love that they can get.” Indeed, Nina, they certainly did then, and they certainly still do now.
So let us, then, ignore white people. I do not mean that in a foolish literal sense in our day-to-day lives in which we just walk past white people like they don’t exist — even as obscenely hilarious as it would be to me if this piece could possibly inspire that. No, I mean let us take more time to deal with ourselves, for ourselves.
Not to abandon the discussion around interracial or intercultural conflicts entirely. That has its place and is important. Rather, to have more conversations, more writing, more art, more songs, more politics, more culture not about the conflict. More culture that’s not addressed to ourselves in the context of what white people are doing to us. More culture that is not speaking about the pain white people have previously caused us. More culture that, as Nina would have it, is not addressed to white people, that doesn’t put them down either ... that simply ignores them.
In many ways, it is exactly what Morrison was suggesting we do. Not explaining ourselves, our histories, and our cultures to anyone else but creating cultures, creating histories, and creating ourselves — for ourselves and no one else. In doing this we should trust that all of that shall be explained to everyone else naturally. As I am confident it will be. Instead of trying to get our culture through to people, if we truly invest ourselves in ourselves, people will want to get themselves through our cultures.
Nelson Makamo, a South African contemporary artist, makes his artwork to capture the hope, beauty, and wisdom of African peoples — not to prove it to anyone else. And people from around the world have flocked to engage with those pieces of culture. Toni Morrison, herself, was familiar with the effect that the white gaze had on black people’s writing. And so she wrote without consideration of it. And now those are pieces of a culture that people want to engage with for their own enrichment.
I ask you, are we free from the powers of white supremacy if we cannot even speak as black people about black people, or if any other people can’t speak about themselves, without invoking white people? I would argue no.
You may, in turn, ask me: Marcus, so how can we not invoke white people in our conversations while we are still under the reins of white supremacy? To that, my answer is simple. We just do. I am not willing to wait for the ever-so historically gracious hand of white supremacy to ease its death grip on my throat before I start speaking directly with my fellow black people, and you shouldn’t be either. If I am only willing to start those conversations on the timeline that the powers of white supremacy are okay with, I have then, and only then, let white supremacy win.
So do not stress, dad, and rest easy, Toni. I am not getting trapped or distracted by any black and white conflict. I am here to pour my love into my peoples and hopefully inspire other people to do the same. Accordingly, I shall continue to ‘ignore’ white people and address this column to my people. And I implore you, in whatever way, to start ignoring too.

A concentration may only be the sum of its course requirements. But looking for a concentration — your concentration — should be so much more than that.
Since 2007, Advising Fortnight — the two-week, no-nonsense, see-as-much-as-you-can, head-down concentration blitz — turned freshman concentration deliberation into a serious and hasty, not to mention somewhat premature, affair. After all, students don’t have to choose a concentration until the coming fall. Much to our excitement, however, the Advising Programs Office has replaced Advising Fortnight with a new Exploring Fields of Study program. Under the new program, each department will host a variety of informational events and advising sessions throughout the spring semester.
While many, like us, have welcomed this new adjustment with enthusiasm, others remain apprehensive. In particular, some advisors have cautioned that the semester-long schedule of events may hinder students’ ability to directly compare the experiences of different concentrations.
Indeed, if the objective of the Exploring Fields of Study program is simply to engage in a direct comparison of concentrations in order to make a firm decision by its completion, then offering a two-week time frame to do so would prove most effective. But that’s not, or at least shouldn’t be, the point.
While freshmen will in fact be prompted to report the conversation events they attended and whether they are considering declaring it by mid-April, this report is not a binding agreement and need not be approached as such. Freshmen still have nearly two semesters, as well as an entire summer, before they need to make their concentration choices. Many students might use this gift of time by taking shot-in-the-dark classes, joining outside-the-box clubs, and exploring new environments that may help them gain clarity on the types of futures they envision for themselves.
Viewing the Exploring Fields of Study program merely as a concentration selection process deprives freshmen of the ability to benefit from the intellectual growth and personal development that the ensuing months should bring. There are many data points to be gathered about a given concentration, and we encourage freshmen to gather as many as possible before they declare their concentrations — at one’s own pace and with the least possible anxiety.
Perhaps a more concentrated fortnight should be offered at the beginning of sophomore year for the benefit of students who are making final comparisons and decisions at the eleventh hour. But for freshmen, that just isn’t necessary yet. In such a high-pressure environment, freshman concentration shopping should be one area in which to slow down and spread things out.
It’s also worth noting that choosing a concentration does not prevent students from pursuing interests in other departments and fields. It is an immense privilege to study at a university that is committed to a liberal arts educational philosophy. We encourage students of all years to continue exploring fields of study well past their concentration choice is made.

We’ve all been there. It’s midnight and we know we should get some rest before the busy week, but somehow we can’t stop watching TikToks. Or we made that New Year’s resolution to get in shape by spring break and yet when the time comes to go to the gym, we just can’t quite pull it together. Why does this happen, again and again?
The heart of this problem lies in our conflicting desires. Part of us wants to just chill, but another part of us wants us to be doing something productive. Certainly, listening to the easy-going voice is sometimes appropriate. But in other situations, where we will be glad if we are able to get in shape or ace that class, how can we beat temptation and be our best selves?
One solution is to just grit our teeth and use our (will)power to battle through the temptation. Be the monk who meditates while experiencing extreme hunger. This approach has its advantages: Research suggests that exercising willpower more frequently leads to greater willpower in the long run, just like training a muscle. The data also show that people with more willpower tend to live better lives, from improved health to higher self-esteem and greater financial security. So, next time you’re tempted, just use your willpower. Duh!
Not so fast. There are times when willpower is not enough, whether it’s because our willpower is depleted because we exhausted it in other situations, or even just because we slept badly. We might also not want to use our mental energy on routine challenges such as going to bed on time or eating healthy because we know we will need that willpower later on to overcome other, more important temptations.
The solution is systemization: To invest mental energy now, when we are not tempted, in order to put in place systems that free our future selves from facing the temptation at all. By thoughtfully crafting the environment we make choices in, we can avoid having to use our willpower, at least for choices we face regularly. Eventually, we will become so used to these environments and the good choices they help us make that what was once an effortful battle becomes habitual. If fighting temptation is the battle, the systematization solution is to, in fact, not fight all … and still win.
Taking time to build a system to avoid temptation is most useful when the temptation is particularly strong and when the potential gains from resisting it are large. Systematization can also be particularly valuable for situations that take place frequently, such as our daily morning routines.
While there are no universal systems that everyone should adopt, there are some examples that are likely helpful for most of us. For instance, to avoid spending time on your phone in bed (which is bad not least for your quality of sleep), it might help to have your phone charger at your desk — away from your bed. Instead of relying on your tempted future self to make the right decision, this setup allows you to avoid the temptation altogether. An even stronger system would be to turn your phone all the way off when you enter your dorm room for the night.
Another situation many of us struggle with is eating healthy given the vast array of unlimited food in the dining halls. One approach to this problem could be to make a habit out of eating a plate of salad before taking any other food. Of course, not buying unhealthy snacks to keep in your dorm room is a great strategy as well. Without unhealthy food readily available, it becomes much easier to resist late-night cravings. Bonus points for finding healthy snacks that help satisfy the craving while also providing the nourishment your body needs.
Good systems like these require little or no mental energy to follow in the moment. By channeling our everyday lives, they allow us to attend to the things that really matter instead of fighting ourselves.
The next time you find yourself tempted but know you really should be doing something else, take two minutes to come up with a system that will help you avoid the temptation in the first place. Your future self will thank you for it, I promise.

Washington Post executive editor Martin “Marty” Baron will travel to Cambridge this May to speak at Harvard’s 369th commencement ceremony on May 28, according to a University statement released Tuesday.
As top editor at the Post, Baron manages the paper’s news operations and staff. Holding top jobs in several newspapers over his more than 40-year career, Baron’s has led teams to 16 Pulitzer Prizes, according to the press release.
Last year, under Baron’s guidance, the Post published the “Afghanistan Papers,” an investigation that detailed previously undisclosed malpractice by United States government officials who supervised America’s military involvement in the Middle Eastern country.
Before he began his current position at the Post, Baron served as the executive editor of the Boston Globe for more than 11 years. There, he oversaw the newspaper’s investigation on sexual abuses by Catholic priests in Boston, for which the Globe won the 2003 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service.
Before he joined the Globe, Baron served as an editor at the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and the Miami Herald.
Born in 1954 and raised in Tampa, Fla., Baron started his journalism career at the Miami Herald as a reporter in 1976.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow said the University looks forward to welcoming him to campus for Commencement in the press release Tuesday.
“Marty Baron has led some of our nation’s most respected newspapers through a transformative time for American journalism,” Bacow said. “His distinguished career bespeaks a deep commitment to the pursuit of truth and to the vital role of a free press in a democratic society. We look forward to welcoming him here on Commencement Day.”
President of the Harvard Alumni Association Alice E. Hill ’81 called Baron a “bold and decisive leader.”
“For decades, Marty Baron has pursued truth and tirelessly championed the role of journalism in enabling healthy democracy and fact-based discourse and debate on critical issues around the world,” Hill said. “A bold and decisive leader in his field, Marty’s distinguished career has been marked by determination, integrity, and a willingness to listen to the powerless and too-often voiceless. He will both inspire and engage our graduating students, Harvard alumni, and our entire community.”
Baron will also receive an honorary degree from the University in May.
Baron’s selection comes shortly after the University announced last week that Koma Gandy Fischbein ’95, a decorated United States Navy veteran, was elected chief marshal for this year’s commencement ceremony.
Gandy Fischbein will lead the alumni procession at the annual meeting of the Harvard Alumni Association and host a lunch in Widener Library on May 28, according to a University press release sent Thursday. Previous chief marshals have included former U.S. poet laurate Tracy K. Smith ’64 and former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’86.
Gandy Fischbein earned several awards during her service in the Iraq War, including a Navy Commendation Medal and three Navy Achievement Medals.  In addition to her military service, Gandy Fischbein was the first woman to coach the All Navy Men’s Rugby team.
Gandy Fischbein said in the press release that she is honored to receive the position.
“I am humbled to receive this honor from so many distinguished classmates,” Fischbein said. “I look forward to returning to Tercentenary Theatre for this momentous day to celebrate all of our journeys, especially those just beginning for the Class of 2020.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council Ordinance Committee convened a special meeting Tuesday to push forward a zoning amendment that attempts to support and increase the number of local businesses in Harvard Square.
The amendment grants exemptions for small businesses who develop retail spaces that are less than 1,500 feet, imposes building height restrictions, and enacts less parking requirements.
The Ordinance Committee called the meeting to vote on whether or not the petition should move ahead to a second reading — a step necessary for the amendment to eventually be put into law by the Council. The amendment passed in a unanimous vote.
Cambridge resident Patrick W. Barrett III wrote the petition discussed at the meeting. Barrett worked alongside the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, the Harvard Square Business Association and Harvard University to craft the proposal.
“In Central Square I did something very similar a couple of years ago where I changed some of the zoning to mitigate some of the more archaic pieces of zoning that we have here. [It was] not nearly enough to fix [it] and this isn't either,” Barrett said. “This is more like a better foundation for what they could build off of if they decided to.”
The petition comes after businesses like Black Ink, Flat Patties, and Crema Cafe have all closed their doors amid rising rents. Barrett said if the petition passed the Council, it would deter the opening of two banks in the Square — businesses which he said reduced foot traffic and occupied a “large portion” of space in “prominent” buildings.
“The bank facades eat up a large portion of some of the more prominent buildings, and what it has the effect of doing is killing those areas for foot traffic, especially at nighttime uses as well,” said Mr. Barnett.
The special meeting was convened to ensure the petition could be considered before its expiration March 10.
In an interview after the meeting, former Cambridge mayor and current City Councilor Denise E. Simmons said today’s vote will give the councilors time to evaluate changes to the petition. She said the Council will discuss the petition at their weekly meeting Monday.
“By voting it to a second reading, we are just making sure it stays on track for ordination and it also gives us an opportunity to do what I think my colleagues want to do, which is to look at the new proposed language,” Simmons said.
“Now we have four days to read through, and we’re going to discuss it on Monday,” she added.
Barrett said he has worked to ensure that the petition will pass with minimal opposition.
“I bring groups together and spend a lot of time with them, so that we don't run into these kinds of problems when we get to play on board, wardens committee, or Council with everyone sort of losing their mind and screaming and yelling at each other because no one really reacts very well to that,” Barrett said. “So, opponents — I would say none.”

Thirty-seven students have declared their candidacies for 16 available seats on Harvard’s Undergraduate Council, according to UC Election Committee Chair Perry M. Arrasmith ’20.
The campaigning and voting period began Tuesday at noon and will conclude at noon on Friday.
The 16 vacancies are the largest number of spots on the Council to be open during February elections since at least 2015. The vacancies the resulted from resignations or term endings. Several representatives resigned this year after serving only one semester of their year-long terms.
The 37 candidates running for seats mark a slight increase compared to last year’s 34 candidates. Among them are 14 sophomores, nine juniors, and three seniors.
The UC seats of four Houses — Currier, Dudley, Eliot, and Dunster — are currently filled. There are also no open seats in three of the freshman yards — Crimson, Ivy, and Oak.
Meanwhile, three Houses — Cabot, Pforzheimer, and Winthrop — will have non-competitive elections. With only one candidate running for two open open seats, there will still be a vacancy in Winthrop House after elections conclude.
The most competitive election is in Elm Yard, with 11 freshmen running for one seat. In the Houses, the most competitive election is in Quincy, which has six candidates running for two seats.
The candidates for Undergraduate Council are as follows:

The Cambridge Police Department reported the lowest crime total in more than 50 years on Wednesday, with officers responding to 2,257 serious crimes in 2019, the lowest number since 1968 and a five percent decrease compared to 2018.
Crime in Cambridge has experienced a steady downward trend since 1990, per a department press release. The number of registered incidents has decreased every year since 2010 — except for 2018. This is the sixth straight year in which reported crime totals have remained below 3,000 incidents.
Serious crimes comprise violent crimes — including murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault — and property crimes — including burglary, larceny, and auto theft. Violent crime decreased by nine percent and property crime decreased by five percent compared to 2018.
Police Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said he was “particularly pleased” with the reduction in gun violence last year. No fatal shootings were reported, and the number of non-fatal shooting victims reached a five-year low.
Bard credited officers and city residents in achieving historically low crime numbers.
“I am very proud of these results, which reflect that Cambridge is safer today than it has been at any point in recent history,” he said in the press release. “I want to commend our Officers, who are deeply committed to working with the community to ensure that Cambridge is a safe and welcoming city.”
Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale commended the department’s dedication to public safety in the press release.
“This achievement is a reflection of the department’s strong leadership and the police force’s commitment to the community,” DePasquale said in the release.
“It also reflects the department's deep commitment to their community partners, and the City Council’s consistent support of our recommendations for additional resources for the Cambridge Police Department,” he added.
Compared to other cities in Massachusetts, Cambridge has historically experienced less per-capita crime in every category except larceny, according to the CPD’s 2018 annual crime report. According to the report, the city’s large business and education populations are popular targets for thieves.

A team of researchers at Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute, and the Harvard School of Public Health investigated the 2016-2017 mumps outbreak in Boston, finding previously unknown genetic connections between cases.
The researchers collaborated with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, using genomic data and public health records to profile the behavior and transmission of the virus in an article published February 11 in PLOS Biology.
The outbreak — the largest in recent history — included more than 60 confirmed cases on Harvard’s campus. University administrators quarantined students for five days in cooperation with the Cambridge Public Health Department to stem the spread of the disease.
In total, more than 420 cases were reported in Massachusetts in 2016 and 2017 despite high rates of vaccination, baffling physicians and public health officials trying to contain the outbreak. Outside Harvard, cases were also found at 18 colleges and universities in the state, including Boston University and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.
Since 2016, mumps cases have cropped up on the Harvard campus at least three times. None of these recurrences reached the scale of the 2016 outbreak.
Co-senior author and Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Pardis C. Sabeti said that the researchers used high-resolution genomic data to fill in gaps from the epidemiological records collected by the University and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.
“Genomic data is like a barcode that tells you what you’re infected with,” Sabeti said. “If you start seeing people infected by viruses with a very similar genome, it’s likely that they were all infected around the same time or from the same chain of events.”
Understanding the transmission and spread of highly contagious diseases like mumps can help contain and prevent future outbreaks. In the newly published study, the researchers discovered genetic links between cases previously classified as unrelated based on epidemiological data, connecting Harvard cases with an outbreak in East Boston.
In addition to revealing new information about the progression of the 2016 outbreak, the investigation into mumps serves as a reminder that college and university campuses are places of of high risk for transmission and infection, Sabeti said.
“You start to notice that there are certain places that become ground zero for an outbreak,” Sabeti said.
Sabeti said the mumps outbreak could be a “simulation” that could help officials contain other diseases, such as the novel coronavirus, if issues arise.
“It [mumps] is not that bad if you’ve had the vaccine, it doesn’t cause really terrible symptoms, but it allowed us to simulate what would we do in a real outbreak,” she said. “With coronavirus, it’s my hope that this one also passes and it’s not as bad as we think it is, but it’s also a great framing to say, ‘Hey, what if the coronavirus came? What would we do?’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign announced Tuesday afternoon that they plan to sue the University over its alleged investments in companies tied to the prison industry.
The five student plaintiffs, who are representing themselves, wrote in a draft of their complaint that the University has benefitted from those alleged investments when it should be trying to help break down a “system of human caging,” according to NBC News, which first reported on the students’ plans. The complaint is set to be filed in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County.
"Instead of helping to dismantle the entanglement of profiteering, government interests, and the system of human caging, Harvard makes profit off of it," the plaintiffs wrote. "That money funds the opulent lifestyles of Harvard's top administrators who are prison profiteers."
University Spokesman Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the planned lawsuit.
The plaintiffs have argued they have grounds to sue based on the fact that all five have donated to the University during the past year. They argue that the Harvard Management Company has violated its commitment to them as donors.
"This is one way to hold Harvard's feet to the fire," one plaintiff— Xitlalli Alvarez, a doctoral student in Anthropology — told NBC.
Representatives for HPDC declined to comment on the suit.
In a report released in October 2019, HPDC estimated the University has at least $3 million invested in companies with ties to the prison industry. University President Lawrence S. Bacow said in April 2019, however, that Harvard’s total prison-related financial holdings amount to roughly $18,000.
University administrators have resisted previous calls to divest from the prison industry.
This new legal push does not mark the first time student divestment activists have filed suit against the University. In 2014, a group of seven Harvard student activists filed a lawsuit against Harvard alleging that the University's investment in fossil fuels was in violation of the school’s original charter.
More recently, HPDC held a series of events promoting prison divestment, titled “Free Them Week,” in late October. Harvard’s divestment movements more broadly made national headlines in November, when protesters disrupted the 136th edition of the Harvard-Yale Game in New Haven. Demonstrators from Harvard and Yale occupied the field during halftime, calling on the two Universities to divest from the fossil fuel industry and from Puerto Rican debt.
Harvard has previously elected to partially divest from companies profiting from apartheid in South Africa and genocide in Darfur, Sudan, and to fully divest from the tobacco industry.
HPDC announced in an email to supporters Tuesday that the plaintiffs plan to hold a press conference at 10 a.m. on Wednesday morning on the steps of the Supreme Judicial Courthouse in Boston.

After a five month campaign, the University announced Tuesday that all five of Harvard Forward’s candidates made it on the annual Board of Overseers election ballot.
Harvard Forward — a student and alumni group working to bring attention to climate change and add recent alumni representation to Harvard’s governance boards — put forward five candidates to sit on the Board of Overseers, the University’s second highest governing body, last fall.
By Feb. 1, each candidate had received more than 4,500 alumni signatures on petitions to get onto the Board of Overseers ballot, according to a Harvard Forward press release. The process requires 2,936 signatures — 1 percent of all eligible voters — to put a candidate on the ballot for the election, which is scheduled to take place from April 1 to May 19.
The University verified and validated petition submissions two weeks after receiving the nomination forms, according to a release from the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
“This year, five candidates, listed below, qualified for the ballot through this process by obtaining a required number of signatures from eligible voters,” the Gazette release read.
Harvard Forward's platform advocates for the University to divest all of its assets from fossil fuels, reserve 20 percent of Board of Overseers seats for recent alumni, and develop more transparent investment guidelines.
Harvard Forward Campaign Manager Danielle Strasburger ’18 said in the group’s Tuesday press release that the candidates' success indicated a desire amongst alumni for Harvard to “become a leader in the fight against climate change.”
“We believe a majority of voters support our platform and want to see the Board address these issues,” Strasburger said.
Harvard Forward’s slate of candidates include John E. Beatty ’11, Lisa Bi Huang, Margaret “Midge” Purce ’17, Dorothy “Thea” L. Sebastian ’08, and Jayson U. Toweh.
Toweh said in the press release that their effort is about enhancing Harvard’s teaching and research on climate.
“Our campaign is also about persuading Harvard to recognize areas of real concern among graduates across all generations and disciplines. It’s about expanding the climate conversation to include issues of economics, public health, and social justice in the university’s investment,” he said.
Beatty said in the press release that the election allows alumni to tell faculty, students, and staff that they believe Harvard must do more to address climate change and make the University more equitable and inclusive.
“We as alumni have a unique chance to ask this great university, our university, to lead in showing what modern, inclusive, sustainable education can be,” Beatty said.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has previously spoken against divesting the school’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry, advocating instead for engagement with fossil fuel companies to combat the effects of climate change. The University has enacted a Climate Action Plan to become fossil fuel neutral by 2026 and fossil fuel free by 2050.
“While I, like my predecessors, believe that engaging with industry to confront the challenge of climate change is ultimately a sounder and more effective approach for our university, I respect the views of those who think otherwise,” Bacow wrote in a Harvard Magazine article last year. “We may differ on means. But I believe we seek the same ends — a decarbonized future in which life on Earth can flourish for ages to come."

As Harvard College searches for five new pairs of faculty deans in the upperclassmen houses, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana spoke about the value of having tenured faculty fill those posts in an interview Tuesday.
The College is currently seeking to fill faculty dean openings in Eliot House, Cabot House, Kirkland House, Quincy House, and Winthrop House. Faculty deans helm each of Harvard’s 12 upperclassman residential houses and are responsible for overseeing residential deans, House staff, and tutors, as well as facilitating House-wide events and advising affiliated students.
In recent weeks, Winthrop students have lobbied for the College to keep current interim faculty deans Mark D. Gearan ’78 and Mary Herlihy-Gearan — who have led the House since August — in their roles. Gearan currently serves as the director of the Institute of Politics. Despite those calls, College administrators have repeatedly noted that Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan, who are not tenured, were only appointed for a single year.
Gearan and Herlihy-Gearan’s success in the interim role has caused students to question whether status as a tenured faculty member in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences should be a prerequisite for serving as a permanent faculty dean.
Khurana cited several reasons why the College prefers to appoint tenured faculty members to the position. He specifically mentioned their “unique perspective” in teaching undergraduates and understanding their classroom commitments and academic pressures, as well as their ability to recruit other faculty into the house and bring them in as speakers.
“We think that helps improve and strengthen the kind of integrated vision that we have for both intellectual, social, and personal aspects coming together in the house system,” he said.
Khurana further noted that tenured status allows deans to speak freely in their roles with greater ease.
“Faculty are able to often — and I can say this for myself as a tenured faculty member — say things without actually fear of or concerns around career prospects,” he said. “And I think that works to the benefit of the students.”
“This is not to say that others don't have important things to bring, but it is part of the philosophy that led to the creation of the House system, and it's part of the philosophy that has guided the House system. And I want to honor that philosophy,” he added.
The five searches also come roughly a year after a campus controversy over former Winthrop faculty dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr.’s decision to defend Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein against sexual abuse charges. The College eventually dismissed Sullivan, and he left Weinstein’s team, but many of the questions about the role he formerly filled remained. Aside from calling on Khurana to remove Sullivan, many student protesters demanded the College clarify what faculty deans owe to their house residents.
Khurana said the College has attempted to “demystify” the process of selecting faculty deans this year by clearly defining the role and sustaining high levels of “community engagement,” both by soliciting nominations and gathering student input on candidates.
He added that the College is “fortunate” to boast faculty who are passionate about contributing to and improving undergraduate residential life, as evidenced by “large numbers” of prospective candidates this year.
“I think that because we've made it more transparent about how you become faculty deans, you'd be surprised at how many people are really interested in that and just didn't understand what was the way to even learn more,” Khurana said.
“I’m really grateful for all the outgoing faculty deans,” he added. “They've done a remarkable job because I think part of what's also attractive to folks is to see the kind of communities that they've created.”
After finalizing its shortlists of candidates, the College will form search committees, host meetings where students and tutors can share input regarding possible candidates, and consult University administrators before making a final selection in each of the five houses.
Khurana said he hopes the College can harness these upcoming transitions as opportunities for Harvard to evaluate the futures of its upperclassmen houses and recommit to the values of its house system.
“In many ways, it's actually a moment of renewal,” he said.

A team of researchers led by Professor Peter D. Manuelian, director of the Harvard Semitic Museum, has discovered an image of an ancient Egyptian deity inside a 3,000-year-old coffin.
The discovery came as part of a week-long project in January to document and analyze three coffins which had been gifted to the museum in 1901 and 1902. While previous researcheres had created thorough pre-existing documentation about two of the coffin's interior designs, the third —  the coffin of Ankh-Khonsu — did not boast any documentation of what scholars found when it was last opened 30 years ago.
Professor Adam J. Aja, assistant curator of collections at the Semitic Museum and a researcher involved in the project, said in an interview that the researchers initially expected there would be nothing of interest inside the coffin.
“We knew there were no human remains, since they had been gifted without the bodies, but we also knew that there often weren’t any inside decorations,” Aja said.
However, to their astonishment, the opening of the coffin revealed a painting on the inside of the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra-Horakhty.
Joseph A. Greene, deputy director and curator of the museum, wrote in an email that his first impression upon seeing the inside of the coffin was muted.
“My first look inside the coffin of Ankh-Khonsu was rather unrewarding since there was a good deal of accumulated modern dust and a layer of ancient black “goo” obscuring the painting on the flat bottom inside,” Green wrote. “After Ankh-Khonsu’s coffin had been cleaned up and the inside properly illuminated, I was able to see the painting more clearly.”
Manuelian said the opening of the coffin marked a rare occastion in the recent history of the Semitic Museum.
“This object had never been opened before in the memory of anyone currently at the museum,” Aja said.
Opening the delicate artifacts required a team of expert curators, photographers, art handlers, materials scientists, and student assistants to comprehensively analyze the construction and design of the coffins.
The Dean’s Competitive Fund for Promising Scholarship — an internal program that awards competitive grants to Faculty of Arts and Sciences researchers — funded the project. Ultimately, the researchers aimed to gather complete images of all three coffins to be digitally stored and shared with researchers around the world as well as visitors to the Semitic Museum.
Greene wrote that the team attempted to take full advantage of the uncommon opportunity to study the coffins.
“Because these coffins are large and heavy but fragile objects, these stresses they underwent over the week of study and recording in January 2020 are ones that we don’t want to repeat in a year’s time or in 100 years’ time. So we took this opportunity to study them as fully and in as much detail as possible,” he wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions filed its opening appellate brief in federal court Tuesday as part of a longstanding lawsuit pending against Harvard over allegations that the College discriminates against Asian Americans in its admissions process.
SFFA argued throughout its brief that a previous district court ruling against it was incorrect and that the appeals court should reverse the decision. The group’s lawyers argued that the district court failed to apply strict scrutiny and failed to appropriately consider evidence of the alleged discrimination.
SFFA’s filing comes roughly four months after district court judge Allison D. Burroughs issued her final ruling at the conclusion of a five-year-long phase of the lawsuit. Her Oct. 2 ruling rejected SFFA’s arguments that the College’s race-conscious admissions policies are discriminatory toward Asian American applicants.
Three days after Burroughs published her opinion, SFFA filed a notice of appeal in the United States First Circuit Court of Appeals, marking the organization’s intent to challenge Burroughs’s ruling.
SFFA’s Tuesday brief reiterates previous arguments that Harvard penalizes Asian American students in the admissions process, practices “racial balancing” when selecting each incoming class, weights race too heavily in considering students’ applications, and has failed to sufficiently explore alternative race-neutral processes.
Harvard has repeatedly denied allegations that its admissions process is discriminatory, and has argued that it considers race as one factor among many in a “holistic” admissions process.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane defended the College’s inclusion of race as a factor in admissions in an emailed statement Tuesday.
“We will vigorously defend the Court’s decision, which makes clear that Harvard does not discriminate on the basis of race in its admissions process, and that Harvard’s pursuit of a diverse student body is central to its educational mission and consistent with longstanding Supreme Court precedent,” Dane wrote. “Today’s filing by Students for Fair Admissions further exposes their ultimate goal of removing the consideration of race in college and university admissions.”
SFFA president Edward J. Blum wrote an emailed statement that the organization hopes the appeals process will ultimately reverse the district court ruling.
“It is our hope the First Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the lower court’s erroneous opinion and compel Harvard to end the use of race in their admissions policies,” Blum wrote.
In one of the Tuesday brief’s arguments, SFFA’s lawyers highlighted their belief that the court erred in applying strict scrutiny. Burroughs accepted Harvard’s arguments, despite the fact that, according to SFFA, Harvard failed to prove that it does not discriminate.
“This analysis is irreconcilable with strict scrutiny,” the appellate brief reads. “Given the serious doubts that the district court harbored, Harvard by definition has not ‘offered sufficient evidence that would prove that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to obtain the educational benefits of diversity.’ The case should have ended there.”
SFFA’s lawyers also contested that Burroughs failed to fully appreciate statistical evidence, evidence related to subjective standards for “personal ratings” in admissions, and internal Harvard communications about concerns over possible discrimination.
The brief’s conclusion is straightforward, reading, “The district court’s judgment should be reversed.”
SFFA’s filing marks just the latest move in a protracted legal battle that has brought national attention on to Harvard’s admissions policies. Documents released throughout the case have revealed previously confidential details about the admissions process, such as how the College considers applications from athletes and relatives of major donors.
Harvard is scheduled to issue its reply brief within 30 days. SFFA will then have three weeks to publish another response to Harvard’s brief.

With Harvard’s Science and Engineering Complex set to hold classes for the fall 2020 semester, the University is more than halfway through completing its Institutional Master Plan, a ten-year development plan for its Allston campus that was first approved in 2013.
The Science and Engineering Complex will serve as a home for facilities of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, with expected daily visitors including more than 900 undergraduate students and 400 SEAS graduate students. It is located next to the Harvard Business School and Harvard Innovation Labs.
In addition to the new complex, the Institutional Master Plan includes now-completed additions to the Harvard Business School campus, including the 75,000-square-foot Chao Center, the 81,000-square-foot Klarman Hall, and the 4,500-square-foot Schwartz Pavilion.
Other projects outlined in the plan that have yet to be completed include the Gateway Project, which will include 300,000 square feet of mixed-use building space, as well as further renovation to the Soldiers Field Park graduate student housing complex.
University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an emailed statement that Harvard looks forward to continued progress on developments in Allston.
“Harvard is in the midst of many ongoing activities in Allston and is enthusiastic about the programs and physical improvements that have emerged through intensive and ongoing consultation with the Allston community and City of Boston,” she wrote. “The growing corridor of research and creativity along Western Avenue will no doubt contribute to a thriving neighborhood.”
In addition to the Institutional Master Plan, Harvard has also released plans for its Enterprise Research Campus, for which real estate firm Tishman Speyer was named the “preferred developer” in December. The research campus will host research and commercial space. It will be located on Western Avenue next to the Science and Engineering Complex.
“We’re very optimistic that the timetable that we set out should be able to be achieved,” Harvard Allston Land Company CEO Thomas P. Glynn III said. “We think the project, when it’s completed, will be one that will make people in the Harvard community proud.”
Some Allston residents have raised concerns regarding Harvard’s expansion in the neighborhood, specifically regarding housing and transportation issues.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, an Allston resident and member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said he and his neighbors still have reservations, especially given the City of Boston’s approval process for the Enterprise Research Campus.
“We still weren’t happy with the specificity that Harvard was dealing with in terms of affordable housing and transportation,” D’Isidoro said of the approval. “Harvard needs to really step up to the plate in Allston to help promote affordable housing."
Glynn said the University has invested in affordable housing developments in Allston.
“The city requires 13 percent of any project to be affordable housing,” Glynn said. “We wanted to do more than 13 percent.”
O’Rourke also wrote that Harvard has devoted resources to increasing access to affordable housing.
“Earlier this year Harvard announced that it would recommit $20 million to an initiative aimed at increasing the amount of affordable housing in Greater Boston,” O’Rourke also wrote in a statement.
As the University expands its footprint into Allston, Harvard students anticipate spending more of their time across the river.
Victor L. Qin ’21 said he expects to have classes in Allston starting next semester and has been involved in the move through the Harvard College Engineering Society.
“I’m on the board of the Harvard College Engineering Society, so I’ve been working closely with administration on what the Allston move might look like for undergraduates,” he said.
Qin described a sense of “general cautious excitement” surrounding the Allston campus.
“People are very excited about the Allston campus. What they’re not excited about, obviously, is transportation worries, food, and other concerns with Allston,” he said. “That being said, I know that there are plans in place to alleviate those concerns.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the first debate between incumbent United States Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.), few major substantive differences emerged between the two candidates.
Kennedy criticized Markey for past foreign policy votes and over campaign finance issues, but he declined to attack the incumbent harshly, and instead called him a “good senator” who has “made an important contribution to our commonwealth and our country.”
In the debate, hosted by WGBH News, Markey stressed his experience and touted legislative accomplishments on policies involving gun control, climate change, and Alzheimer's disease research. He has served in the U.S. Senate since 2013.
“On the big issues of today — the challenges of today — I’ve not only been leading, but I’ve been delivering with legislation which passes, which protects the people of Massachusetts and the whole country,” Markey said.
Markey also trumpeted his introduction of the Green New Deal — a resolution aimed at curbing carbon emissions — with freshman U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).
“The Green New Deal, since we introduced it — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and I — just one year ago, it’s transformed the debate on this issue,” Markey said.
The two candidates sparred over campaign finance during the hour-long debate. Kennedy, a 2009 graduate of Harvard Law School, threw barbs at Markey for declining to comply with the People’s Pledge, which aims to limit outside money in politics, in this election. Markey signed onto the pledge back in 2013.
Markey argued that candidates “should not silence” progressive groups. He has released an alternative to the People’s Pledge that barrs negative advertising funded by outside organizations but still allows for third-party spending.
“How are you ever going to pass a Green New Deal if you allow the fossil fuel industry to open up the spigot and flood the airwaves with scare tactics?” Kennedy retorted.
Kennedy also drew a distinction between himself and Markey on foreign policy issues. He criticized Markey for his 2002 vote in favor of the Iraq War and his 2013 “present” vote on a resolution to authorize military force in Syria.
Markey said that the administration of former President George W. Bush “lied” about the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq.
“It was a false pretense to start a war,” Markey said. “I’m still angry about the lie to the American people. I regret that vote. It was a mistake.”
Markey said that he voted “present” in committee on the 2013 Syria authorization due to a “rush to judgement” and a lack of information.
To defend his foreign policy record, Markey touted endorsements from several peace groups, including Peace Action and the Council for a Livable World.
The two candidates articulated similar views on many of the debate topics. They both posited their support for similar immigration reforms and Medicare-for-all. Both also chastised President Donald J. Trump for decisions he has made in office and called for Attorney General William P. Barr to be impeached.
Barr has come under fire in recent weeks after he intervened to lessen the Department of Justice’s sentencing recommendation for Trump associate Roger J. Stone Jr.
“This president violates his oath of office to protect every single citizen literally on a daily basis,” Kennedy said.
Erin O’Brien, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said Kennedy “punted” on multiple opportunities to differentiate himself from Markey.
“My main takeaway from the night is that Kennedy got two opportunities to say why he was better and different than Ed Markey — both in the opening question and in the closing — and both times he punted,” O’Brien said. “I think that was purposeful because people like both Ed Markey and Joe Kennedy, so Joe Kennedy doesn’t want to activate anger.”
“But ultimately, at least on the policy side, this is a race of what differentiates the two, and I don’t think Kennedy did that tonight,” she added.
O’Brien said she thought the debate was a “draw,” but noted that Markey had a strong start to the evening when the discussion was focused on climate change.
“He was able to dominate the first 15 minutes of discussion on an issue that he is recognized to be a real leader on,” she said.
Speaking to reporters after the debate, Kennedy said he hopes to “leverage” the power of a Senate seat in a blue state better than Markey has over his time in office.
“Senators from this state have traditionally been able to leverage that position to and the platform and the platform that comes with it,” he said. “I think we can get more out of this seat.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past weekend, Harvard Track and Field split their efforts, with part of the team competing in the Valentine Invitational at nearby Boston University and part of the team competing at the Tiger Paw Invitational in Clemson, South Carolina. Crimson records were tested and broken on the long weekend, as a pair of Havard runners from both the men’s and women’s sides had incredible performances in the mile.
Entering the weekend, the women’s team was ranked No. 1 in the region while the men’s team was not far behind, ranked No. 2 in the region.
The second day of the Valentine Invitational was where most of the excitement happened, with strong performances across the board including but not limited to an all-time record broken in the mile for the Crimson.
That performance record was broken by none other than cross country standout and senior Kieran Tuntivate who ran a blistering 3:57.36 to win the event, breaking the once famed four-minute mile barrier, placing second in the Ivy League all time and fifth in the NCAA this year. Obviously, this performance smashed the Harvard record in the event, as Kieran continues to decorate the Havard record books with his individual efforts.
“Personally I want to do well at nationals, I don’t know what event I’ll do, but we’ll see,” said Tuntivate on his personal goals for the year and beyond. “And then I definitely will continue running post-collegiately, hopefully take a shot at going to the Olympics and world champs next year as well.”
Senior Mike Kolor and junior Kaeo Kruse earned personal bests in the mile, finishing in 4:06.83 and 4:11.25 respectively. Kruse’s run was over 10 seconds faster than his previous personal best as the men’s mile runners had a very successful day as a collective.
Along with the record-breaking mile performance, not to be outshined, other Crimson athletes turned in their own strong performances. Junior middle distance runner Ryan Thrush won his heat in the 500 meters and ended up finishing second overall in the event with a time of 1:02.60, good for third all time in the Harvard record books. All other Crimson runners that competed in the 500, junior Charles Lego, sophomore Max Serrano-Wu, and senior Jacob McLennan, had personal bests in the race, showing off strong group training.
Junior standout sprinter Jovahn Williamson took home second in the 400 and sixth in the 200, building off his success at last week's meet. Junior Kahil Wassell finished in 15th in the 60-meter dash with a time of 7.14 seconds. The top performer outside of the track was junior Wesely Donhauser, who placed 13th in the men’s weight throw, good for a personal best. To conclude the night, junior long distance runner Will Battershill notched a personal best in the 3000-meter run, good for third all time in the Crimson record books. A pair of first-years, Acer Iverson and Ben Hartvigsen, and sophomore David Melville grabbed personal bests as well in the event, as the distance runners continued their strong team performances from the fall cross country season.
“I want to take it one meet at a time,” said Tuntivate when asked about team goals. “I think we have a shot at winning HEPs (Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championship) this year on the men’s side, which would be pretty awesome considering where we’ve been.”
Just a day before, the Harvard women had their own champion performance as junior Abbe Goldstein turned in an incredible showing in the mile. Goldstein crushed her previous personal best with a time of 4:35.70 on the way to a seventh-place finish in the event, placing her second in the Crimson record books for the event. Just behind Abbe was cross country star and junior, Anna Juul, who placed 11th with a time of 4:37.87, just off her personal best. Goldstein's stellar effort in the mile places her in 10th in the NCAA this year, a sure highlight for the Crimson Track and Field squad this season. Tuntivate and Goldstein likely punched their tickets to nationals with their performances and will look to build on their success as the season progresses.
“For the women’s side on distance Abbe Goldstein ran a fantastic race, likely to get her a spot at nationals, while on the guy’s side Kieran Tuntivate hammered a 3:57 mile and qualified for nationals in his second event,” said sophomore David Melville on the highlights from the weekend. “Going forward the team is gearing up for HEPs and trying to get ready to score as many points as possible in two weeks.”
To round out day one of the Valentine Invitational, middle distance junior Tessa Medrano finished in 10th in the 1000-meter run, crossing the line in 2:48.67, on the way to a personal best. This strong effort was good enough for fourth all time in the event for Harvard women. Sophomore Fredericka Lucas earned a top-35 finish in the long jump, senior Martha Kebeh and sophomore Obie Amudo placed 16th and 24th in the weight throw respectively, while senior Maya Miklos and junior Rachael Estell, nabbed 34th in the 400-meter dash and 34th in the long jump each.
Down south at Clemson, sophomore pole vaulter Alana Caroll placed ninth, clearing 3.82 meters on her best effort. This result landed Caroll in fifth all time in the Crimson record books for the event. Fellow sophomore vaulter Kylie Hilton cleared 3.67 meters, finishing just behind in 14th.
Other notable performances in the Tiger Paw Invitational included senior All-Ivy Leaguer Simi Fajemisin, who placed 19th in a highly competitive long-jump heat with a mark of 5.90 meters. Back on the track, senior hurdler Zoe Hughes earned a new personal best, crossing the line in 8.66 seconds in the 60-meter hurdles.
Day two of Tiger Paw saw junior Erick Duffy take home an impressive third place in the men’s pole vault, and Fajemisin continued her strong invitational with a seventh-place finish in the triple jump.
Looking ahead, Harvard Track and Field has a week off before returning to action at the huge Ivy League Indoor HEPs Championship, hosted by Cornell. Building off impressive performances from the men and the women, the team will look to train before its biggest meet of the season thus far as it competes for the Ivy League title.

Love it: Health is Wealth – Janani Sekar
Think you don’t like salad? Well, think again. Since my first time trying the chain, Sweetgreen has transformed my life and my outlook on healthy eating. I was expecting an unappetizing mixture of leaves, but what I got was a bowl of healthy greens, rice, and protein: the true definition of perfection.
With choices of both warm bowls and cold salads, Sweetgreen has something for just about everyone. There are a variety of different flavors and options, such as the curry chickpea bowl or the spicy Thai salad. And for those of us who refuse to be confined by a menu, Sweetgreen even has the option to build your own salad that speaks to your cravings.
My true love for Sweetgreen, however, comes down to salad dressing. After weeks of eating boring HUDS ranch and honey mustard, Sweetgreen’s fancy dressing options are much appreciated. I am a personal fan of the spicy cashew, which somehow managed to convince me that kale isn’t gross.
Yes, I will admit that Sweetgreen is on the pricier end, but the quantity of food in every order makes up for it. With a bowl full of salad plus a slice of bread, every meal I buy at Sweetgreen lasts for both lunch and dinner. While it may not be sustainable for everyone to drop $12 on salad every day, Sweetgreen is worth a try at least once in your life. Just remember, you’ll be eating food that both tastes good and is good for you!
Hate it: Overpriced Lettuce – Anna M. Peters
$10.95 plus tax for a bowl of mixed leaves, a few pieces of chicken, a few apples, toasted almonds, and cheese. While the supposed health benefits of eating a Sweetgreen salad for lunch may seem tempting, is it really worth paying that much? Consider that $10.95 is one of their mid-range priced salads — many of Sweetgreen’s salads cost as much as $12.95. Now, think of how many loads of laundry you could do, or actually being able to afford printing your readings and psets. Truly, a wild concept.
Also, has anyone noticed that no matter what time you go to Sweetgreen, there’s always a line? The seven-minute minimum wait seems to be inescapable. It’s almost as if Sweetgreen doesn’t understand that we are all on a tight schedule with no time to waste — all we want to do is order some food and leave. Sure, we could order on the app and have it ready to be picked up when we arrive. But the true “thrill” of the experience, i.e., hand-picking the ingredients you want tossed in, is gone.
If you still have that Sweetgreen craving of yours, recreate it at the dhall. We understand that you may not all be the biggest fan of dining hall food, but toss some lettuce, spinach, cucumbers, beets, chicken, quinoa, and cheese together. There you have it — a Sweetgreen salad for no cost, a solution for a broke college student.
