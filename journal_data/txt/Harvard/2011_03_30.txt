After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday, while waiting for a review session to begin, a freshman was kind enough to play Rebecca Black’s “Friday” on the projection screen for all of Science Center Hall B to enjoy.
One of my friends spent the greater part of the video complaining about the injustice of having such an insipid song gain notoriety while the music of many genuinely talented artists remains in obscurity. Ten minutes later, she subconsciously broke into a cheerful round of “Partyin’, partyin’, yeah!” Despite its myriad flaws, the song clearly has a parasitic ability to nestle inside the depths of one’s mind and replay itself into oblivion. With sufficient listening, it may even become pleasant for the hard-core pop music lover. So where did “Friday” go wrong?
It seems that Rebecca Black’s lack of charisma in her music video spelled its ultimate downfall. Today’s popular music landscape consists of songs such as “That Should be Me” by Justin Bieber and Rascal Flatts—a 17-year-old superstar and a middle-aged country trio commiserating about a lost love—and ones such as “No Sleep” by Wiz Khalifa that exhort partying in lieu of rest with an ironically lullaby-like melody. What makes these whimsical songs lovable, while Rebecca Black’s ode to the weekend is laughable? In a word, confidence.
Consider another teenage songstress, Selena Gomez, who is dominating music video sales on iTunes with her song “Who Says,” an inspiring but less-than-novel anthem with lyrics that include “Who says you’re not star potential/Who says you’re not presidential.” Gomez, a Disney titan, is comfortable in front of the camera and exudes an organic earnestness that will cause her target tween demographic to sing along rather than roll its eyes. Similarly, in the music video for her Billboard chart-topping “Born this Way,” when Lady Gaga gives birth to herself—in space, no less—she sells it as only Gaga can. As conveyed in their music videos, these artists clearly believe that their songs are likeable—or, in the worst case scenario, they are sufficiently trained in acting to pretend that they believe in their music.
Black, on the other hand, wears the same forced, uncomfortable smile on her face throughout the “Friday” video, whether she’s waking up, watching her underage friends pull over their car at a bus stop, dancing next to a tree, or just kickin’ in the back seat. When our heroine wails, “Which seat should I take?” she doesn’t look at all conflicted or, at the very least, exultant that her biggest problem is the trivial conflict at hand. There are glimpses of what appears to be real expression—Black looks relieved when she sees her friends, and seems to loosen up slightly in the final scene of the video—but they are diminished by the teen’s timid dance moves and mechanical eye contact with the camera. Whether Black was nervous or whether she genuinely hated the song, her performance suggests that she is feeling “Friday” even less than the audience.
The hilarity of the song itself lies in the way that Black’s singing conveys emotional investment in lyrics such as “Yesterday was Thursday/Today it is Friday.” She sings these lines with the out-of-place sweetness of a seventh grader daydreaming about her gym class crush. Whether by virtue of AutoTune or Black’s relatively higher confidence in the recording studio, her inflections make her halfhearted video performance appear even more awkward.
Because Black is neither a polished Disney triple threat nor a veteran performer, she has every right to be uncomfortable on stage. This amateurism could easily be forgiven—and empathized with—in a home video meant only for Grandma, but not in the context of the level of exposure that Black presumably desired. Perhaps the blame ultimately lies with Ark Music Factory, the production company that armed Black with a semi-sleek video without training the aspiring singer in proper performance technique.
Many have interpreted “Friday” an inadvertent parody of pop music. It does fulfill the most basic requirement of a parody: The artist is clearly aware that her music video is a farce. In the end, if Black had demonstrated that she was sincerely having all that “fun, fun, fun, fun” she claimed to experience, there is a chance that her video would have garnered a little less sarcasm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The United States is approaching a financial reckoning. People may disagree on the direction of budget decreases, but in the future, fiscal woes will likely force the government to tighten its belt. In these uncertain times, defense appropriations are a perennial target for reductions and, for some, a politically palatable alternative to reforming entitlements.
Admittedly, defense spending cannot be considered in isolation from our long-term picture of fiscal responsibility. At the same time, hasty or substantial decreases to defense research and procurement risk impairing America’s strategic capabilities. The “cost of freedom” may be high, but in a 21st century teeming with external threats, the U.S. must maintain a heightened sense of security.
The idea that major declines in defense are preferable to other spending cuts arises in large part from some common misperceptions. Chief among these is the notion that defense is especially rife with fraud. A dispassionate analysis suggests this view is misleading. There are miscalculations on behalf of firms that aid the federal government, but these minor excesses are dwarfed by those caused by structural problems inherent in the government procurement process itself. As one senior official dryly observed, blaming contractor abuse for high defense spending is akin to “arguing over nickels and dimes while billions go marching quietly out the door.”
The fundamental problems endemic to defense procurement are complex and due to a variety of factors, but often include changing contract specifications, micromanagement of the purchasing process, poorly defined performance goals, and “requirements creep,” a process in which the original goals of a system are continually expanded as it is further developed. In short, inefficiency is the primary culprit for cost overruns.
The history of defense procurement also demonstrates that focusing too heavily on cost rather than capability may drive up the former and reduce the latter. And this is not unique to America, as Britain’s ill-timed retirement of the Nimrod and Sentinel aircraft shows. In order to save relatively minor production costs, Britain cancelled its advanced surveillance airplane and ignored the substantial R&D funds it recently invested to finish designing the model.
“Silver bullet” approaches with names like ‘total system performance responsibility’ and ‘fixed cost contracting’ have tried to solve multiple problems with one blow. But ultimately, adding additional layers of government oversight or making minor alterations in how contracts are assessed is insufficient to address deep, structural problems in procurement practices. Extensive defense is of course an expensive proposition, but America can significantly reduce this cost by downsizing the excessive bureaucracy that stifles efficient defense procurement, as the drive by Defense Secretary Gates to eliminate $100 billion of overhead-spending demonstrates.
Serious analysts on both sides of the aisle agree that procurement reforms must be undertaken. Still, the critical issue is determining what defense capabilities are needed to support American national interests in the future, and how to develop such capabilities responsibly. As a nation, we must ask, “What defense capabilities do we need, and how can we pay for those within a stable long-term fiscal picture?” rather than a trite “How much can we cut from defense this year?” Again, no part of the budget should be sacrosanct, but as economists like Harvard’s Martin Feldstein also note, defense spending as a fraction-of-GDP has been dwindling over the past decades.
Moreover, defense spending normally enjoys broad bipartisan support and stimulates job growth in great states brimming with economic activity, from Texas to New Jersey and California to New Hampshire. As an added bonus, it also helps the US stock market grow and preserve its edge. Last year, Reuters reported that defense acquisition multiples and valuations increased and Deloitte predicted more activity in the sector. Pricewaterhouse Coopers also noted defense deal flow doubled. Even, or especially, in tight times, well capitalized defense companies continue to boost their assets by obtaining niche firms and divesting from enterprises not central to their portfolios. As capital markets unfreeze, defense IPO’s like that of BAH will also grow.
Financial institutions play an essential role in this; sell-side firms broker deals and buy-side entities identify targets. Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisitions, former Kennedy School Professor Ashton Carter, has thus far tried to strike a balance between consolidation and competition in the defense sphere. Regardless of budget directions in future years, this trend will likely continue for national security reasons, as well as efficiency purposes. Mergers and acquisitions keep the defense community effective and pioneering, and help firms stay on the cutting edge.
As an aside, the part that nontraditional defense has played in spurring M&A underscores its growing role. Firms that provide consulting services or budgetary analysis are an important component of the defense infrastructure and cater to cabinet-level departments like Treasury, HHS, Energy, and State, whose diplomatic efforts are critical. To be clear, conventional equipment is still mandatory to deter growing peer competitors, yet services like cybersecurity and intelligence collection are also now vital for asymmetric conflicts.
The U.S. defense industry has long worked with dedicated civil servants to help America sustain its safety and primacy and assist our brave men and women on the front lines. As the 21st century begins, it should and must continue to do so.

In Ghana, it just takes a text message to buy life insurance. In Bangalore, India, urban sex workers receive automated voicemails informing them about critical health issues, microfinance loan deadlines, and vocational training opportunities. In Kenya, 55 percent of adults use mobile phones to make cash transfers—from electricity bills to school fees—using a technology called M-PESA. 
Mobile phones are revolutionizing international development and social change. Already, governments, non-profits, businesses, and everyday citizens are leveraging vast mobile phone networks in many countries to promote social development in innovative ways. Perhaps most important, these mobile networks have the potential to reach marginalized populations, especially in rural areas, and to provide them with transformative new opportunities.
This revolution is about more than philanthropy; it extends beyond simply making donations via cell phones. In fact, cell phones aren’t always the most effective way for donors to make a difference. For instance, text donations being made to help victims of the environmental disasters in Japan may not be processed for on to three months, as phone carriers will only give the money once donors pay their monthly phone bills. While mobile phones are in some cases an effective philanthropic tool, their revolutionary potential lies in their facilitation of grassroots movements for social change.
Mobile phones can facilitate better governance. They can help government entities to communicate with citizens and improve the delivery of social services. For example, in Kerala, one of the most socially developed states in India, the regional government sends text messages to parents of newborns, reminding them to vaccinate their babies and explaining how to navigate this process. Conversely, mobile phones can empower citizens to voice their needs and concerns to the government. For instance, SeeClickFix is a platform that allows people to submit information on everyday, non-emergency problems like a traffic light timing problem, road potholes, or blocked bike lanes. Governments can then effectively respond to these issues, as New Haven, Conn. policemen did when they arrested the culprits of petty neighborhood crimes reported through this platform.
Mobile phones can help entrepreneurs reach new markets. The new initiative in Ghana allowing citizens to purchase life insurance plans via text message caters to low-income populations that do not have bank accounts. Through this system, users pay lower premiums. This gives a large population access to a previously inaccessible service while simultaneously growing the life insurance enterprise. In numerous countries in the developing world, mobile phone-based programs like Farmer’s Friend in Uganda and Dialog Tradenet in Sri Lanka are helping farmers to find updated information on market prices. This particularly benefits farmers in rural areas, giving them access to information that will help them to maximize their profits.
Mobile phones can sow the seeds of cultural change. iHollaback allows everyday citizens to use cell phones to report street harassment. The submitted stories are compiled in a blog format online, juxtaposing the reports and mapping them to show the clusters of incidents around the world. By empowering people to voice their experiences, this powerful technology subverts the prevailing culture of silence surrounding harassment.
Mobile phones can combat widespread social problems. In Ghana and Nigeria, mPedigree undermines the fake drug trade. By sending the system a text message with a code found on their medicines, citizens can verify the authenticity of the drug. In the United States, PeaceTXT is using mobile technology to enhance CeaseFire, a Chicago program that uses data to detect and interrupt violent events.
 
Mobile phones can fuel social movements. In countries where authoritarian regimes control many forms of social media, cell phones can enable dissidents to communicate their messages and rally support for uprisings. In Indonesia in 1998, students used cell phones to coordinate protests that precipitated the downfall of the incumbent President Suharto. This was seen again in the recent social revolutions and uprisings in Africa and the Middle East. In Angola, for instance, protesters used SMS to organize demonstrations against the ruling regime.
Why have mobile phones suddenly become so powerful? Quite simply, the power of cell phones lies in their vast network. Mobile phones are nearly ubiquitous, especially in developing nations, where cell phone service can be quite inexpensive. Since 1998, the number of cell phones in Africa has increased from under four million to over 400 million, now serving almost half the continent’s population. In India, there are 560 million cell phone users, including some 80 percent of the adult population.
I noticed this myself when I traveled to India last summer. Although I spent most of my time working in an impoverished village on the outskirts of New Delhi, I found that even within the least privileged strata of society, nearly everyone had a cell phone. The widespread penetration of mobile phones across the developing world, especially amongst rural, marginalized, and impoverished populations, makes this technology all the more powerful in effecting transformative social change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the onset of spring comes the onslaught of accepted student visiting programs at many major colleges and universities. Set against what is often a picture-perfect backdrop of turquoise skies and emerald green lawns, these programs often seem to assume the aesthetic of a summer camp, complete with sleeping bags, ice cream parties, and, a rosy, unaffected attitude towards the coming reality.
Harvard’s own program, “Visitas,” formerly known as the April Visiting Program, is one of these events whose mission appears to “sell” the school rather than to show it as it really is. As a result of this somewhat misdirected emphasis, prospective students often get a depiction of Harvard that is superficial and, frankly, deceptive. Although allowing time for students to experience Harvard’s social environment is important, the program should also include more substantial programming and greater interaction with current students into the schedule of events.
Rather than accomplishing its intended goal of providing accepted students with an accurate sense of the next four years, Visitas submits to the admissions arms race that has unfortunately taken hold of most competitive institutions. Sadly, this increased competition has led many colleges to avoid presenting their unique identities in order to secure the highest possible matriculation rate. As these programs illustrate, there seems less of a tendency for colleges and universities to emphasize their niche aspects and more of a tendency to emphasize items of general appeal. With academic institutions enticing admitted students with free merchandise and fun events rather than portraying the college experience accurately, we have to wonder whether these students are being set up for greater disappointment upon their arrival in the fall.
For instance, prominent events of this year’s Visitas include Prefrosh Palooza, Sunday Sundae, the Extracurriculars Fair, and, coinciding for the first time, Yard Fest. While these events certainly do a great deal to represent Harvard’s extracurricular and social environment, they leave little room for exploring academic opportunities or the more day-to-day aspects of campus life. Prospective students should spend more time getting to know the campus they may choose to call home by visiting classes and talking with current students about dorm and house life.
In turn, current Harvard students should fulfill their end of the obligation and make a greater attempt to interact with the admitted students. The Office of Admissions should not have to emphasize the low-maintenance aspect of the host’s job to convince current students to volunteer; students should realize the importance of hosting and volunteer on their own. A recent email the office released stressed that “hosting only requires a little bit of warmth and friendliness and some floor space!” In short, this should not be the pitch, and the fact that current students can request to host up to six admitted students indicates a serious lack of quality control on the part of the administration.
Additionally, admits should have the chance to meet faculty members. We begrudgingly applaud Yale’s Bulldog Days for providing admitted students with the opportunity to take master classes with professors. The initiative shows a true desire to immerse students in the academic atmosphere of a place and allow them see if the fit is right for them. Perhaps recent arguments against Harvard’s lack of substantive student-faculty relationships might be curbed by an earlier opportunity for such interactions to take place.
In the grand scheme of things, Harvard attracts so many bright, qualified students on a yearly basis that an emphasis on “selling” the experience is not necessary. The College has more to lose by misrepresenting its image than by losing students who might have been lackadaisical about attending in the first place. Although great emphasis and energy should be placed in attracting applicants to Harvard, this effort should not be purposefully insincere or misleading.
To the future Class of 2015, we wish you the best of luck in making your final college decisions and hope that you when you visit college campuses in the coming weeks you distinguish between the real and the simulated.
Oh, and another thing to keep in mind: Don’t pick Yale.

Neurosurgeon Donald Hilton, an associate professor at the University of Texas, told a packed audience last night that pornography consumption has negative effects on masculinity, social interaction and demographics at a talk organized by True Love Revolution, a student advocacy group that promotes premarital abstinence.
“It’s impossible to talk about masculinity today without talking about the impact of pornography,” Hilton said.
He said that the “traditional male is an endangered species” and that this shift from traditional gender roles impacts demographics and lower fertility rates in the developed world.
“Sexuality, in my opinion has been underrated as a demographic factor,” Hilton said. “I think Tom Wolfe was onto something when he said that ‘the bigger pornography gets, the lower the birthrate becomes.’”
Pornography is also detrimental to women’s perceptions of their bodies, Hilton said. He said that some women undergo cosmetic gynecology out of a desire to mimic porn actresses’ genitalia.
Hilton also said that pornography that features violence against women can have negative sociological effects, encouraging misogyny for men who use internet pornography as a sexual instruction.
Hilton said that he believes that the biological cause of pornography addiction function similar to pheromones—chemicals that trigger social responses.
“Pornography is, I believe, a visual pheromone—a powerful brain drug—that is changing sexuality more rapidly through the cyber acceleration of the Internet and it is inhibiting orientation,“ he said.
Hilton also said that this trend detrimentally affects masculinity by desensitizing males to “appreciate female beauty” and perpetuating pornography addiction, which he defined as compulsive pornography use and compared to physical substance abuses.
Hilton argued that excessively viewing pornography results in neuromodulation of human brains, a process that influences the organ’s structure, making it are similar to “gambling, drugs, Sadomasochism and pedophilia,” which he claimed were also addictions. Through the brain’s pleasure center, pornography consumption is rewarded by the provision of dopamine, similar to physical sexual contact, and therefore can be addicting, he said.
The lecture elicited mixed audience reaction.
Taras B. Dreszer ’14 said that he found the talk to be overly moralistic.
“I came to the talk because I was interested in a neuroscience perspective, and I was disappointed by the fact that his points were only loosely backed by science,” Dreszer said.

When Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64 graduated from Radcliffe College, William James Hall was still under construction.
Forty-seven years later, she works on the 11th floor of that very building.
Carey is a part of a unique group of professors for whom Harvard is not only their employer—it’s their alma mater. With the perspective of a former undergraduate experience, these professors have helped shape the school that sent them on their own career paths.
“Harvard is the only college I applied to,” remembers Carey, who, after a lengthy hiatus as a professor at various other colleges, returned to Harvard in 2001.
Professor John E. Dowling ’57 says he still has his letter of admissions—saved in a scrapbook of Harvard memorabilia—which documents the beginning of his Crimson-infused career.
A PRETTY LIBERAL PLACE
The undergraduates of a past generation remember a very different Harvard.
“No one in my school had ever heard of Radcliffe—they had heard of Harvard, but they hadn’t heard of Radcliffe,” says Carey, who graduated six years before “The Great Experiment,” when Harvard and Radcliffe undergraduates began to share housing.
Dowling recalls an early meeting his proctor held with his entryway.
“They told us that Harvard was a pretty liberal place, that if you had too much to drink, you wouldn’t get into too much trouble. But, there was one thing that if you did, you were gone, you’d be history. And we’re thinking, what heinous crime could this be?” Dowling says. “And he said, having a woman in your room after 8 o’clock at night.”
Carey remembers the Radcliffe perspective of that social scene, which she says was dominated by dating.
“I’ll tell you, I never didn’t have a date,” she says. “It wasn’t based on networks of friends hanging out. There were parties, but you went to parties with a date. It was fun!”
Having graduated from that world, Dowling has turned much of his attention back to student life on campus. Since he joined the faculty in 1961, he has been an active force in the evolution of Harvard undergraduate life over the years. He is the namesake of two separate commissions that evaluated the role of student governance on campus, in 1981 and most recently in 2009.
And even after serving as master of Leverett House for 17 years, Dowling fondly recalls those quirky incidents that only an undergraduate could experience.
“My freshman year, I was in Wigglesworth D-12,” Dowling says. “One day I forgot my key and since my room was on the first floor, I tried to climb through the window. Of course, a HUPD police officer came over right at that moment and questioned me for an hour until I could persuade him that I lived there.”
SIGN OF A GREAT TEACHER
Dowling says that his academic experience at the College would shape his approach as he crossed into the Faculty.
“I had one professor who made science fascinating—George Wald, who went on to win a Nobel Prize for discovering the role of vitamin A in vision,” Dowling says. “He made me interested in what I’ve spent my whole life working on. That’s the sign of a great teacher.”
But Dowling remembers rarely having access to such faculty as a result of his large, impersonal introductory science classes.
“They were really pretty terrible,” he says.
His contempt for introductory classes was part of the reason he returned to Harvard. Wald, by now his mentor, asked him to help design and teach a new undergraduate biology course at Harvard. Dowling, who had taken a leave of absence from Harvard Medical School to study biology, agreed—further deferring Harvard Medical School, from where he says he is still on leave.
Carey, too, considered introductory courses ineffective as an undergraduate, and found solace in the personalized environment of her sophomore tutorial. She recalls switching concentration three separate times—from math to biology, then to anthropology—until a tutorial leader sparked her interest in psychology.
As chair of the Psychology Department, Carey has overseen a push for greater interaction with students—including faculty dinners and more comprehensive advising.
For the last 15 years Carey has run an undergraduate internship program, and this summer she plans to host undergraduate student researchers in her lab.
“I would like to find that post-doc [tutorial leader] and tell him, ‘you did an amazing thing. You followed my interests instead of imposing yours.’”
THE BUG
Computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 recalls the harsh reality of Harvard undergraduate life. He says he arrived at Harvard a math star, only to find that the College was full of stars.
“I took the equivalent of Math 25 or 55 today, and I figured out that being the best math student in my [high school] class of 24 did not translate into being the best math student at Harvard,” he remembers.
Lewis would eventually overcome this disappointment and become one of the most influential College deans in recent memory, serving from 1995 to 2003.
But his path back to Harvard began with a love for a budding field that he was exposed to through a part-time job in a psychology lab—computer science. Lewis would graduate in applied math, 16 years before the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences would offer a stand-alone computer science concentration.
“I then got bitten by the computer programming bug, and fell in love with it,” he says.
Lewis never strayed far from Harvard, finishing his graduate studies there in 1974 and joining the Faculty soon after. Since 1981, he has served as the Gordon McKay Professor of Computer Science—still several years before the creation of the concentration itself.
For Dowling, that bite of the Harvard bug was less predictable, but equally potent.
“My brother was surprised,” he says. “He recently told me that he never thought that 50 years later, I would still be at Harvard.”

A Brazilian hydrology expert called for a holistic approach in solving São Paulo’s water supply vulnerability in a lecture at the Center for Government and International Studies yesterday.
“São Paulo does not have a water problem, but a land use problem,” said Monica Porto from the University of São Paulo. According to her, the main challenge is to efficiently distribute the limited water resources to a city of 20 million inhabitants in light of rapid urban expansion, high population density, and pollution.
Porto advocates both demand and supply management in order to manage the water supply in a sustainable manner. The reduction of consumption and water leakage are essential in order to avoid straining the watersheds that have virtually no potential for further expansion, she said.
Porto also discussed the sociological issues that worsen the situation, such as the recent urban expansion in São Paulo—especially in poorer suburbs—due to an increase in the number of residential units housing smaller families. The water companies are reluctant to provide sewage and water access to these impoverished areas because of low profitability, she added. This trend allows the creation of slums, sometimes at the borders of the reservoirs, and causes a direct threat to the sustainability of the water supply due to the pollution caused by inadequate sewage systems.
Since the area surrounding São Paulo is divided into 39 municipalities, there is tension among them over issues of water use.
“Every big city has to go and get water from the outside ... I think there is a water transfer problem, a systemic problem in Brazil,” said environmental engineering professor John Briscoe, former World Bank country director for Brazil and professor of an undergraduate course that focuses on water management.
The World Bank loans funds to Brazil to improve the hydrological infrastructure and rehabilitate polluted areas.
Other challenges include recurring flooding of the city and the dumping of sewage waste into the river, Porto said. Prevention in these areas has achieved substantial improvements but requires further investment, she added, highlighting that “the sewage of 10 million people is discharged in the river.”
“There is no silver bullet—there are many pieces that will come together such as demand management and land management,” Briscoe said.
Graduate School of Design student R. Charles Howe said that he “wants to use urban planning in managing the situation.” Howe has experienced the conditions in São Paulo himself through a Harvard water-engineering project in Brazil during J-term.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Currently a freshman in high school, one inquisitive web user wants to know what his chances are of gaining admission to Harvard College’s class of 2018. He attends what he describes as a top private school where he is enrolled in the most rigorous courses offered to freshmen. Not wanting to leave anything to chance, he is also active in his local community—volunteering at a local library and staying involved with his church’s youth group.
To get information on his chances four years down the road, he turns to the popular college admissions website College Confidential with a “chance me” post.
While this is just one ambitious high school student, adults involved in the college admissions process report that as applying to highly selective universities becomes increasingly competitive, students have become more and more stressed. This pressure has not only detracted from students’ high school experiences but has also impacted the broader educational environment even at young ages.
The Pressure
While many ambitious students certainly put pressure on themselves to gain admittance to highly selective universities, experts report that the current environment deserves much of the blame.
In an experience that most Harvard students know all too well, high school students who seek to attend elite universities overburden themselves in the hopes of becoming more compelling college applicants. Under pressure, these students often take on the hardest classes and overextend themselves in a variety of extracurricular activities.
“Students feel a lot of pressure in high school to take every [Advanced Placement] course that’s offered,” said Michael S. McPherson, a former president of Macalester College. “They feel a lot of pressure to never take a course where they risk getting less than an A. Those are educationally undesirable things.”
This high school experience often makes students feel as if they have to participate in activities that they are not legitimately interested in, according to independent Conn. college counselor Gay S. Pepper.
“The biggest fallacy is that the kids think they have to be everything to everybody. You only have to be good at what you like. They feel that if they let up someone else will get ahead of them in line,” she said.
Harvard College Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that the increasingly stressful admissions process is representative of a broader shift towards a more competitive educational environment at younger ages.
“Initially, people tied [the problem] to college admissions and then they realized that it’s just a step along the way,” Fitzsimmons said. He expressed concern over the growing sentiment that young children have to get into the right preschool in order to succeed in life. This belief, he said, continues to drive behavior even after college when students are applying to graduate schools and finding employment.
Richard J. Weissbourd, author of the book “The Parents We Mean to Be,” echoed Fitzsimmons’ sentiments that the increasingly competitive educational environment extends beyond high school.
According to Weissbourd, children might sense that their parents want them to attend top-tier institutions even when they never say this explicitly. Parents often inadvertently create a high-pressure environment while trying to help their children.
“If my neighbors are getting their kids an SAT tutor, I feel like I’m cheating my kids if I don’t,” said Weissbourd, who is a lecturer at the Graduate School of Education and the Kennedy School.
College counselors say that in many families, pressure to attend a top institution begins at an early age.
“There are parents who make it their life mission to get their kid into an Ivy League school. By the time they get to high school, there’s no time for any kind of life,” said Amy Sack, a clinical psychologist who serves as president of admissions consulting firm Admissions: Accomplished.
She said that many parents seek her services as early as seventh grade, but that she does not take on students that early.
The Solutions?
While counselors, education experts, and admissions officials alike acknowledge the problem, there is no agreement on potential solutions.
Suggestions have ranged from selective schools expanding their enrollments to colleges simplifying their applications and better explaining their admissions processes. By encouraging students to take a gap year to recuperate, the Harvard admissions office also took part in the debate in a paper entitled “Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation.”
Earlier this year, McPherson and Sandy Baum—a professor emeritus at Skidmore College who works as an analyst for the College Board—published a piece online advocating increased enrollment at highly selective colleges. While acknowledging that such an aim would be difficult to achieve, they said that a coordinated move to increase class size could alleviate stress among applicants.
Still, counselors suggest simpler solutions that they believe could greatly ease stress without a complete overhaul.
Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at California college counseling firm IvySelect, suggested that colleges trim down the number of supplemental essays that applicants must complete.
“Do schools really need three supplemental essays?” he asked. “Perhaps limiting it to one supplemental essay would make life a tad easier.”
Goran suggested that colleges provide students with clear information about how their admissions processes are conducted.
Sack said that she believed that universities need to stop encouraging unqualified students from applying. One student who scored below 500 on all three sections of the SAT received a letter from Columbia University in New York encouraging him to apply, Sack said.
“They’re never going to take a student with those numbers,” she said. “His parents called me and said they didn’t realize he was an Ivy League candidate. They didn’t know anything.”
Fitzsimmons’ support of the gap year focuses more on dealing with stress than preventing it. He argues that taking a gap year, or taking time off more broadly, provides some students with a necessary break.
He said that it’s an opportunity to have a “reality check to see if you’re using your life in a way you believe in.”
Despite all of the problems caused by stress, Fitzsimmons still insists that the increased pressure is a byproduct of increased access to a tertiary education.
“The democratization of higher education really meant that more and more people wanted to go to college,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Facing a 30 percent drop in the University’s endowment, cookies at Faculty Meetings had became a luxury.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences administrators removed the cookies—as a symbolic gesture that garnered heavy media attention—from the meeting as one part of sweeping cuts to the school’s expenses that included laying off 77 FAS employees and trimming departmental budgets.
For FAS, the largest school in the University, the endowment’s collapse caused a $220 million deficit—of an operating budget of $1.2 billion.
In Dec. 2008, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced to a packed Faculty meeting salary freezes for faculty and staff and asked department administrators to trim 10 to 15 percent of their budgets.
But recently, the financial outlook is improving.
In Sept., the Harvard Management Company, which oversees the University endowment’s investments, announced an 11 percent investment return. This increase not only beat the HMC’s target of 8.25 percent but also allowed for an increase in the FAS distribution—the amount of money allocated to the school from the endowment—for the 2012 fiscal year.
But compared to peer institutions like Yale and Princeton, FAS has reduced its deficit, which today stands around $35 million, more efficiently than other universities, many of which are still examining additional areas for cost reduction.
“I think the FAS administration has done an astonishingly careful job in making cuts and I think they’ve done an astonishingly amazing job in reducing the deficit from $220 million to $35 million,” English Department Chair W. James Simpson said. “In that way, we might have been able to perform better than some of our competitors.”
HEALING HARVARD
Three months after Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy, sparking the 2008 financial crisis, University President Drew G. Faust sought to combat one of the most precarious financial situations in Harvard’s history by imploring deans to cut costs.
“To ensure that we are in the best position to respond to this new set of financial realities, we are working with each School to focus on a range of capital and operating budget-reduction,” Faust wrote in a letter to the deans.
Her statement came on the heels of a 22 percent decrease in the endowment’s nominal value from July 1 through Oct 31, with losses in nearly every single of its asset classes.
As the endowment dropped, so did the distributions to the University’s individual schools: In the fiscal year ending in June 2010, FAS would see its distribution drop 8 percent. It would drop another 12 percent the next year.
During those two years, departments across FAS struggled to meet Smith’s target of 10 to 15 percent reductions. Some departments eliminated staff positions, while others saw staff depart with an early retirement buyout option.
The History and History of Science departments adopted a centralized, off-site staff support system to cut costs.
Some departments, like English, were able to turn to reserve funds.
“I had thought that the cuts were going to be more dramatic than they ended up being,” Simpson said.
After announcing an 11 percent increase in the endowment value—following a restructuring of its investments to maintain diversified asset classes but drift from illiquid holdings—the Harvard Corporation approved a payout rate for the 2012 fiscal year that would lead to a rise of 4 percent in the nominal value of the distribution FAS would receive from the endowment.
That increase has freed administrators from the penny pinching that marked the previous two years and allowed them to turn back toward a focus on academic programming.
“We’re finally at the point that we can worry about things other than not buying paper clips,” History of Art and Architecture Department Administrator Deanna Dalrymple said in an interview early this month. “We can now worry about putting more focus on the academic ambition within the department—bring back symposia, host panels, think again about the academics.”
And FAS department staff members are hopeful about that transition.
“I’m in an optimistic mood,” History Department Administrator Janet H. Hatch said. “Yes, we still have some ways to go with the remaining deficit, but we’ve also learned how to operate at the same level more cheaply—and it’s easier to maintain it.”
YALE YEARNINGS
But as FAS approaches a balanced budget, Yale President Richard C. Levin and Provost Peter Salovey announced in January that Yale would pursue another round of budget cuts, to be approved this May.
In an email to faculty and staff, they said that for fiscal year 2012 they expected a 5 percent decrease in non-academic budgets, while academic programs would maintain their slimmed down budgets.
Although Yale’s endowment increased at 8.9 percent last fiscal year—less than the investment return seen at Harvard—the university still faces a more daunting deficit of $68 million.
Rather than immediately making cuts in the wake of the financial crisis, Yale has relied on its reserves in order to bridge shortfalls in the budget. As a result, it has been slower to make necessary long-term cuts, according to The Yale Daily News.
Staff consolidation still lags behind projected timetables and will continue next year, the YDN reported.
At Harvard, FAS refrained from spending the majority of its large reserves—which stood at $138 million in 2008—in the first two years after the crisis. In May 2010, Smith said the school would draw on the reserves more heavily as it tackles the remaining $35 million deficit by the self-imposed 2012 deadline.
PRIVATE EQUITY PRINCETON
Valued at $350 million, Yale’s deficit was more than twice that of Princeton, which was pressed to meet a $170 million shortfall.
Though Princeton was able to reduce its deficit to $82 million by the end of the 2010 fiscal year, it, unlike Harvard, had to freeze salaries for a second year.
Princeton has also received criticism for its investment strategy as overly reliant on questionable investment vehicles. In the wake of the crisis, The Daily Princetonian reported that the university was expanding its illiquid private equity holdings, a practice questioned by Princeton alumni as overly risky. Harvard has since moved away from many of those investments.
Harvard faculty members and administrators said that this transition in strategy is only one of many ways in which University leaders have moved quickly to address the University’s financial needs in a way that has not necessarily been seen at peer institutions.
“And I only have admiration that, going forward, the leaders in FAS administration will be able to solve this situation in the best interests of the school,” Simpson said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Representatives of the National Rifle Association argued that an increase in the purchase of registered guns leads to decreased crime rates at an event last night sponsored by the Harvard Republican Club and the Harvard Shooting Club.
The talk, which attracted about 100 people, was part of the NRA University program that tours college campuses to educate students about the second amendment.
Director of the NRA’s Grassroots Division Glen A. Caroline said that the second amendment is vitally important to citizens’ safety, freedom, and, if necessary, protection against their own government.
“I kind of look at the 2nd Amendment as an insurance policy,” Caroline said.
Caroline said that Americans, who are law-abiding and mentally stable, should be able to buy guns free of government restrictions.
He condemned a current law in Va., Calif., and Md. that prohibits citizens from buying more than one handgun a month.
“It’s like saying you can go to church, but only on one Sunday a month,” he said of the law.
The group considers itself non-partisan, though it generally supports Republican candidates in its opposition to most gun control. Seth M. Waugh, the NRA’s grassroots coordinator, spoke about different campaigns he has staffed, and expressed his joy that George W. Bush defeated Al Gore ’69 in the close 2000 presidential election.
“I shudder to think what would have happened in our country and to my job had he been elected,” he said.
Students at the event, most of whom supported the NRA, said they were pleased to see the program come to campus.
“I was a glad a conservative group was coming to a more liberal university,” said Aditi Ghai ’14.
Attendees said they found the event surprisingly educational.
“I thought it was really interesting—it cleared up a lot of misconceptions about gun-control laws,” said Salvatore R. Rinchiera ’14. Rinchiera added that he plans to participate in pro-gun activism in the future as a result of the event and the free NRA membership offered to all attendees.
The NRA representatives at the event also encouraged everyone to vote, a point that was highlighted in videos they screened featuring Chuck Norris, who is a spokesman for the NRA’s Trigger the Vote campaign.
“If you won’t register to vote, you’ve already surrendered,” said Norris in a video the representatives showed at the event. “I will never surrender.”

Students from varied social circles discussed the skewed social dynamic between male and female single-sex groups and the need for some form of University recognition for these groups during an event in Adams Lower Common Room yesterday.
The conversation on female social space—co-sponsored by the Women’s Center, the sorority Delta Gamma, and the all-female social organization The Seneca, Inc.—consisted of large and small group discussions about the role of single-sex social spaces on campus.
One recurring theme was the slanted power dynamic between male and female social organizations. Participants examined reasons for this imbalance and discussed possible solutions.
“This conversation made me think about the fact that Harvard’s history as an all-male institution means the male finals clubs have got very entrenched footholds [sic],” Anastasia N. Roda ’12 said. “In a way, not recognizing [single sex social organizations] is discriminating ... [that’s why] the main social scene is controlled by men.”
The discussion of whether or not single sex organizations should be recognized was a hot topic throughout the night.
“I think it’s important that the faculty recognize these groups’ role in campus life,” Seneca member Margaret A. Muller ’11 said. “It seems that the prevalent attitude with the faculty is that if it is not seen, it does not exist ... of course, that’s not true.”
For some, the prospect of single-sex organizations being recognized by the University seemed like the first step to correcting the gender power imbalance in the social scene.
“The faculty should recognize single-sex organizations,” Roda said. “It might give the other organizations the kind of foothold they need to start to compete [with final clubs].”
According to event organizers, the inspiration for the event came from a desire to formalize the casual conversations about the issue that many had heard around campus.
“Students on campus often talk about social life,” said Alexa I. Stern ’12, president of the Seneca and a co-organizer of the event. “We wanted to bring together a diverse group of people for this important discussion.”
Students attending the event felt it was necessary to address the issue of social space for single sex organizations.
“I think it’s a really important conversation that needed to happen,” Muller said. “Given the turn-out, a lot of people feel the same way.”

For the first time in its over 50-year history, the James Bryant Conant Prize is being awarded to a project consisting of wood, clay, twisted wire, and beams of light rather than a collection of words on a page.
Though the official results have not yet been announced, Quincy K. Bock ’11 was notified recently that her model of X-ray diffraction, designed to illuminate key elements of the famous Rosalind Franklin DNA image that contributed to James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick’s discovery of the double helix, will be one of the winners.
The prize was created in 1953 upon the retirement of Harvard University President Conant to reward students, especially non-scientists, for engaging science writing in interesting ways.
The prize was dormant for about the past 10 years, according to Administrative Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen.
Last year, with the initiation of the new General Education program, the prize was revived—but only this year was the submission criteria expanded to include artistic and multimedia projects in addition to papers.
Due to an increasing emphasis on creative assignments in Gen Ed courses, the committee thought it would be wise to welcome non-narrative submissions, according to Kenen.
“Students can use the same kinds of evidence and background as they might in an essay, but they’re doing it visually or in a spoken way,” Kenen said.
Bock, a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, coupled her interests in photography and science education to create a pedagogically useful piece of scientific artwork for the fall course Science of the Physical Universe 20: “What is Life? From Quarks to Consciousness.”
“We just vaguely touched on the discovery of DNA and this photograph in class,” said Bock, an inactive Crimson photo editor. “I thought it would be cool to figure out how it was taken and also analyzed because it’s very different from a regular photograph.”
Bock set out to create a projection box that imitated an X-ray diffraction machine like the one Franklin used. She also sought to show how Franklin’s 2-dimensional image depicts each 3-dimensional component of DNA.
Slides inserted into the projection box show the patterns created by different elements of a DNA double helix, including helices, phosphate groups, and base pairs. The project also features clay models of each 3-D structural element.
“What was particularly interesting about it was that she created this with a pedagogical idea in mind,” said SPU 20 professor Logan S. McCarty ’96, who is director of physical sciences education. “The hope was that students would simply put more of themselves into this and immerse themselves into the project more deeply than they would in a paper,” McCarty said.
But the projects have had an additional benefit, said physics professor Melissa E. B. Franklin, another SPU 20 instructor, who noted that the professors plan to use the model in future course lectures.
“If you look at the image, it takes about eight paragraphs to make it make sense,” Franklin said, explaining that words were not the best medium through which to teach about this photograph. “Just the way she pulls it apart would never have occurred to me.”
Bock, who has previously made other artistic science projects such as a wooden wave machine, said she appreciated having the ability to engage with science in a physical, creative capacity.
“I enjoyed getting to mix and overlap and expand those different knowledge bases in a way that someone else might not think to do or might not want to do,” Bock said.
McCarty said he hoped Bock’s model could be exhibited somewhere on campus so her project could reach a wider audience.
“It was so well done,” Kenen said of the model.
“It was thinking through and communicating visually the important scientific information in this iconic image while creating a tool that the faculty are going to use going forward.”
Kenen noted that broadening the Conant Prize criteria to include non-writing projects “sits very well” with Conant’s initial vision for Gen Ed.
When Conant became University president, he was a leader in launching the Gen Ed program and prioritized the creation of science courses that non-scientists would take, enjoy, and learn from, explained history of science professor emeritus Everett I. Mendelsohn.
“My own sense was that he was just deeply engaged in trying to transform education at the college level in general,” said Mendelsohn, who came to Harvard as a graduate student just as Conant’s presidency ended.
Conant had taken a leave of absence during World War II to act as a science advisor, and Mendelsohn said Conant felt that “in the postwar period there was the sense that we had to do something more, that we wanted to somehow improve the nature of education and society.”
The Conant Prize winners from both fall and spring courses will be announced officially at the end of the year, Kenen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nicholas P. Negroponte, the driving force behind One Laptop Per Child—the non-profit organization that provides low-cost laptops to children around the globe—recalled the entrepreneurial obstacles he faced despite his philanthropic mission.
His presentation, jointly sponsored by the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business and the Leadership Institute at Harvard College, provided students an opportunity to engage with a successful social entrepreneur and hear about the difficult progress Negroponte’s organization has made since its formation in 2005.
The OLPC has provided low-cost laptops to 2.5 million children in 40 countries since 2005, but Negroponte said the path has been challenging.
He said his concept of a cheap laptop was initially dismissed, but contacts he acquired while working at MIT since the late 1960s helped the project gain traction.
Still, it lacked commercial interest until word of the project began to spread.
He soon drew interest from long-established computing giants Intel and Microsoft, he said, introducing competition into the market and providing new, unforeseen challenges for his philanthropic organization.
“The real difference was between thinking about children as a mission versus a market,” Negroponte said.
He said he expected his organization’s “Mother Theresa shield”—the protection afforded by OLPC’s partnership with the United Nations and what he considered the goodwill of its cause—would help the organization avoid the corporate pressure.
In addition, Negroponte said, the OLPC met criticism on how they were verifying their project’s success, lacking evidence showing that giving a kid a laptop and walking away is a successful strategy.
Negroponte and the OLPC are now addressing this concern, he said, by implementing empirical research to see if children will learn to read—and read to learn—when given a laptop to use at their whim.
The OLPC project arose, Negroponte said, from an observation of a friend and MIT mathematician Seymour A. Papert, an early pioneer of artificial intelligence.
Papert, in his research on technology and learning, observed that programming and debugging computer software offered children incredible learning experiences.
Together, Papert and Negroponte brought this insight to Senegal and Pakistan, where they offered children the opportunity to use computers and were blown away by the pace at which they learned how to operate them, Negroponte said.
“These kids played the computers like pianos,” he said.
Audience member Tina Liu ’11, who said she is interested in a career in social enterprise, said she viewed OLPC’s story as a reality check.
“It was surprising to see a non-profit with a glorious mission meet such obstacles,” she said. “But at the same time, their success is very encouraging.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Editor's note: The article below was a breaking news report. An updated version of this article, which appeared in the March 31 print edition of The Crimson, can be found here, along with photography and video taken at the Office of Admissions.
Harvard College today offered admission to a record low 6.2 percent of the applicants to the class of 2015. This group of accepted students was selected from an application pool of nearly 35,000 students—more than applied in any previous year.
Notification letters were mailed shortly after noon today. Students who elected to receive their decisions online were sent emails beginning at 5 p.m. eastern time.
“Stepping back, we feel very good about the future ... You can’t help but feel optimistic when you look at an applicant pool like ours,” said Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67. “It’s a big sign that American higher education has democratized.”
Students accepted to class of 2015 represent an increasingly diverse spectrum of students from around the country and the world—17.8 percent of the class is Asian-American, 11.8 percent is African-American, 12.1 percent is Latino, 1.9 percent is Native American, and 0.2 percent is Native Hawaiian. Approximately 20 percent of the admitted students are either foreign citizens, U.S. dual citizens, or U.S. permanent residents.
The financial aid budget increased to $160 million this year, and more than 60 percent of the class of 2015 is expected to benefit from an average need-based scholarship of more than $40,000. Under the provisions of the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, students from families with a household income of less than $60,000 are able attend Harvard at no cost.
The College did not disclose the number of students given the opportunity to take a position on Harvard’s wait list. While Fitzsimmons said numbers vary from year to year, he said his office generally hopes to accept 50 to 125 students off the list.
Accepted students must notify the College whether they intend to enroll by May 1 in order to hold a place in the class.
The decline in the acceptance rate is consistent with the numbers at peer institutions. The acceptance rate for Princeton University’s class of 2015 was 8.39 percent, down from 8.8 percent last year. At Stanford University, 7.1 percent of applicants gained acceptance, a slight decrease from 7.2 percent the year before.

This story has been revised to reflect the following clarification.
CLARIFICATION: MAR. 30, 2011
An earlier version of the Mar. 30 article "Harvard Accepts Record Low 6.2 Percent of Applicants to the Class of 2015" said that 20 percent of admitted students are foreign citizens. In fact, nearly 20 percent of the class is composed of foreign citizens, U.S. dual citizens, and U.S. permanent residents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the fans behind him, the wind in his face, the lights above him, and UMass’s goalie standing between him and an upset win for Harvard, Crimson co-captain Dean Gibbons attacked, splitting defenders, and fired the shot that would put the Crimson ahead for good with 2:28 remaining in the game.
In one of its most highly anticipated games of the season, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team (6-2, 1-1 Ivy), ranked 20th in the latest Inside Lacrosse poll, took on the No. 14 Minutemen (5-3, 0-1 CAA) in their annual intrastate rivalry game.
“This game was all about bragging rights for being the best team in the state of Massachusetts,” Crimson coach Chris Wojcik ’96 said. “You’ve got two teams that play [with] very similar styles: [both teams] like to run and play aggressive.”
The play of the teams was aggressive, but despite the constant complaints that rang out from the stands, the referees swallowed their whistles.
The visitors struck first and remained in the lead in a one-sided first quarter until Harvard junior attackman Jeff Cohen caught the ball with 10 seconds left in the quarter.
Sprinting hard towards the goal with mere seconds left in the frame, Cohen hurled the ball past the UMass goalie into the back of the net to bring the Crimson within one, 3-2.
The second quarter was much the same with the Minutemen scoring two goals to increase its lead before Cohen was able to score once again for Harvard to close the half, 5-3.
But despite a combination of turnovers and sloppy play, the Crimson kept it close going into the break.
“I told my team at the half that we had just played our worst half of lacrosse all season and we were only down two,” Wojcik said.
In the opening minutes of the third quarter, the Minutemen looked as though they were ready to put the game away, scoring three unanswered goals to take a commanding 8-3 lead.
But Harvard would not go down that easily.
After scoring a goal of its own and giving up yet another score, the Crimson went on an offensive tear. Harvard picked apart the UMass defense for four straight goals, culminating with an unassisted score from sophomore midfielder Ryan Stevens.
Yet it wasn’t just the Crimson’s heralded offense that allowed them to keep the game close.
“The main reason we were able to stay in the game was due to the play of [sophomore] Harry Krieger in goal,” Wojcik said. “He kept us in it, save after save.  He was our most valuable guy.”
“I was seeing the ball really well, but our defense was playing unreal,” Krieger added. “We played hard when we were down and just tried to pull it out against a really good team.”
Along with Krieger, Gibbons also stepped up for Harvard, scoring the goal that put his squad ahead, 9-8, with 8:17 left in the contest.
The Minutemen responded, tying the game at nine with 4:57 in regulation.
But Gibbons wasn’t done.  He scored yet again to complete his hat trick, and Krieger and the defense were able to shut down UMass for the remainder of the game to come out with the victory.
Freshman midfielder Daniel Eipp managed to add one more goal for good measure, sealing the 11-9 win.
“I was really proud of the way we played in the second half,” Wojcik said.
Key to the second-half comeback was the play of Gibbons, who has been on an offensive tear this season. The six-foot attackman has scored in all but one game for the Crimson this season for a total of 18 goals. His 29 points and 84  shots both pace Harvard.
The victory may also yield postseason implications, as Harvard looks to build its resume for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
But for now, the Crimson is content with its spot at the top of Massachusetts men’s lacrosse.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
High expectations often disappoint. But that wasn’t the case for Harvard freshman Alexandra Kiefer.
On Sunday, Kiefer captured the 2011 NCAA Fencing Championship in women’s individual foil, capping off an incredible season for the rookie who could have easily folded under the lofty expectations and demands that her talent had earned her.
After knocking off Princeton’s Eve Levin in the finals to win Harvard’s third-ever individual women’s fencing championship, Kiefer finally felt as if she could take a breath.
“I don’t know, I can’t even describe it,” Kiefer said. “It’s almost more of a relief, I guess, because there were such high expectations.”
Kiefer, who started fencing when she was about eight years old, has plenty of fencing blood in her family. Her father, Steven, fenced at Duke and was the one who got her interested in the sport at a young age.
But perhaps even more important for Kiefer was being able to fence with her younger sister.
“I’d say my biggest fencing inspiration is my sister,” Kiefer said. “We’ve been fencing together since we started.”
Though her father and sister are now over 700 miles away in her hometown of Lexington, Ky., Kiefer seems to have found a new fencing family in her Crimson teammates.
“The team itself is just so close, so supportive,” Kiefer said. “That’s the reason that I decided to go to Harvard.”
Kiefer attributes much of her success this year to the team environment—a new experience for the rookie who spent the majority of her career fencing without a team.
“Coming here and just being with the team all the time and having that motivation, I think that’s why I’ve been doing so well,” Kiefer said. “And it’s been so much more fun.”
But Kiefer hasn’t been the only one benefitting from her addition to the Harvard squad.
Known for having an upbeat personality both in and out of competition, Kiefer, according to her teammates, has been able to bring intangible benefits in addition to her wins.
“She’s always happy and smiling, and I think that she brings a rather positive energy to the team,” said junior co-captain Caroline Vloka, who earned the NCAA women’s sabre title in 2010. “There’s always a really big need for people like Alex to keep the morale up.”
Harvard coach Peter Brand was quick to echo Vloka’s sentiments about Kiefer’s effect on the team.
“She has a wonderful attitude,” Brand said. “She’s upbeat, positive all the time, and works without fail.”
Kiefer’s success has been clear all season long. In her first competition in a Harvard uniform—the Garret Open held at Penn State in November—Kiefer came home with gold. Certainly expectations were high, but the freshman found a way to not only maintain her success, but also improve over the course of the season.
By the end of the year, Kiefer posted an overall record of 62-7. In Brand’s eyes, Kiefer’s performance this season is a feat that rivals the rookie performance of former Harvard fencer Emily Cross ’08. Cross, who won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, also claimed the 2005 NCAA women’s foil title as a freshman.
“[Alex] started off on a high note, obviously, at Penn State,” Brand said. “She sustained that and got even better and stronger over the year…and obviously was able to maintain that focus and maintain that consistency, which is very difficult to do.”
Having achieved one of the greatest personal goals for which a college fencer can aim, Kiefer may shift her priorities as she continues to fence for the Crimson. While the freshman looks for a repeat title next year, she seems to have placed a greater emphasis on helping the team succeed.
“I want to do better as a team,” Kiefer said. “I just want to make sure that I keep enjoying it, the sport, because it makes so much of a difference if you actually enjoy it.”
Kiefer’s teammates and coaches have more than just wins to look forward to in the next three years—they get to enjoy the company of Alexandra Kiefer.
“She’s one of those people that you just have to like,” Vloka said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the beginning of its season, the Harvard softball team’s offense failed to ignite, and the team had to rely on its strong pitching to earn victories.
But that all changed yesterday at Soldiers Field.
In its home-opening doubleheader, the Crimson (14-10) scored a whopping 25 runs en route to two easy victories over Rhode Island (1-23), 15-7 and 10-0.
“It’s really exciting to play on our home field for the first time,” junior pitcher Rachel Brown said. “It was a little cold, but it was great. We came out with great energy and started scoring at the beginning of our first game and didn’t stop.”
HARVARD 10, RHODE ISLAND 0
Coming off of a dominant performance in the afternoon’s first contest, Harvard kept up its offensive momentum, beating the Rams, 10-0.
The Crimson took an early 1-0 lead when, in the first inning, an RBI single by junior first baseman Whitney Shaw brought home freshman third baseman Kasey Lange.
Two innings later, Harvard broke the game open. A single and two walks loaded the bases with just one out, and the Crimson capitalized.
After a Rhode Island passed ball brought home sophomore left fielder Stephanie Regan, freshman catcher Alison Scott plated Lange with an RBI single.
Then, Shaw stole home on a double steal, and junior shortstop Mari Zumbro knocked in two more with a single.
Shaw’s two-run homer in the fourth inning and sophomore designated player Jessica Ferri’s RBI single brought Harvard to 10 runs, ending the second game of the day early.
“I think everybody really just picked up on the energy from the people before them,” Brown said. “So once we got the rally started, it just didn’t stop. No one wanted to make that last out, and the offense did a great job of keeping the momentum in our favor.”
The Crimson also managed to keep the Rams scoreless despite the tough pitching conditions.
“It’s almost like pitching in the rain,” said Brown of playing in the cold. “It’s tough to get a grip on the ball and your fingers don’t move as well. But you know both teams were playing in it, so no team has the advantage.”
HARVARD 15, RHODE ISLAND 7
In its first game of the day, Harvard managed to knock in 15 runs against Rhode Island before the game was called at the bottom of the fifth.
The Crimson grabbed a 2-0 lead in the first inning, as Lange plated senior shortstop Ellen Macadam, and Scott doubled to center to drive home Lange.
The home team built on the first inning, scoring five in the second frame.
Regan drove in sophomore second baseman Kassy Shiotani on a fielder’s choice, and Lange singled to bring home senior center fielder Emily Henderson.
Shaw slammed a two-run double, and Shiotani hit an RBI single to bring in the final run of the inning.
But for Harvard, the runs just kept coming.
In the next inning, Shaw’s second two-run double, Shiotani’s two-RBI single, and back-to-back home runs by sophomore catcher Olivia Piccione and Macadam capped an eight-run inning, giving the Crimson a commanding  15-1 lead.
The Rams seemed to come alive in the next two frames, as the visitors scored six runs while keeping Harvard off the scoreboard.
But it proved to be too little too late for Rhode Island, as the game was called after the fifth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With some seasons just coming to an end and others picking up speed, Crimson athletics are feeling the ups and downs of collegiate competition.
THE GOOD
Men's Fencing
The team won 14 straight matchups before ending its season by taking home four medals in the NCAA Northeast Region Championship and placing fourth in the NCAA Championships.
During the streak, Harvard took also home the Ivy League and Beanpot titles.
The Crimson won all five of its Ivy League Championship matchups, capping the tournament with a title-clinching victory against Yale on Feb. 13, downing the Bulldogs, 14-13.
Men’s Swimming and Diving
Harvard charged out of the blocks, reeling off nine consecutive wins, topped off by a 266-87 trouncing of Yale on Jan. 30, to start the season .
After a hard-battled meet, the squad took home second place in the Ivy League after falling only 5.5 points short of the champion Princeton team.
The Crimson divers also distinguished themselves with three representatives in the NCAA Zone Diving Championships.
Sophomore Michael Stanton finished 13th in the one-meter final and 16th in the three-meter final, while freshman Joe Zarrella came in behind his teammate with a 16th-place finish in the one-meter final. Senior Zac Ranta also took 13th in the three-meter final.
THE NOT SO GOOD
Baseball
The team has lost seven out of its last nine games. And those losses coupled with another nine-game skid at the start of the season, including sweeps by Jacksonville State, Wofford, and Charlotte, have made for a tough season so far.
The Charlotte sweep was a particularly rough weekend with the Harvard lineup being outscored 16-2 over the three-game series.
On the plus side, the Crimson managed to pull out a pair of wins in last weekend's series against NYIT.
Men’s Volleyball
After an impressive 6-1 start to the season, Harvard looked poised to have a strong year.
But five straight losses have put a damper on the once-promising season. And with only five matchups left on the schedule the Crimson is running out of time for redemption.

2011 has been something of a goldmine for John F. Kennedy '40 fans. In January, the Kennedy Presidential Library honored the 50th anniversary of its namesake's inauguration by releasing a digitized collection of JFK's documents to the public. These included such items of historical interest as the President’s Harvard application and records relating how a young JFK hired a female secretary to work out of his room typing his thesis, somewhat to the consternation of the administration.
This April, ReelzChannel will be offering Kennedy buffs still more to chew on, in the form of an eight-part miniseries entitled "The Kennedys." There has been much drama about this particular drama, which stars Greg Kinnear as John F. Kennedy '40, Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy, Barry Pepper as Robert F. Kennedy '48, and Tom Wilkinson as Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. '12. The ambitious series was originally developed by the History Channel—its most expensive program to date—only to be canceled after completion due to outcry from friends, relatives, and former aides of the late president. Theodore Sorenson dubbed its script "one-sided," "vindictive," and "malicious," while Caroline B. Kennedy '80 was reported to have appealed personally to a top executive of Walt Disney Co.—a partial owner of the History Channel—in the successful effort to quash production.
After a period of artistic limbo during which time "The Kennedys" was turned down by Starz, FX, and Showtime, the miniseries was finally picked up by ReelzChannel, where it will begin airing on April 3. Looking at the show's promotional material, it's not hard to see what so offended the Kennedy clan. If the series's trailer is any indication, "The Kennedys" is far from friendly hagiography. The preview opens with Joe Kennedy, patriarch of the family, instructing his sons that "If you boys don't remember anything else I say, remember this: It's not what you are, it's what people think you are—and with the right money, you can make them think whatever you want." But while liberal groups cry foul and organize petitions against "Kennedy smears," the show's executive producer insists that the series is "meticulously researched," noting that the final script was vetted by the History Channel's own historians and that the "Shakespearian" Kennedys were a great but nonetheless flawed family.
For now, curious prospective viewers can check out The Daily Beast's recap of eight controversial incidents culled from a leaked early draft of the show’s script. Come April, they can tune in and judge for themselves.
