After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In this week’s episodes of “The Young Pope,” the Church struggles to get to the measure of Lenny Belardo’s ambition. Belardo emerges as a true villain, and the cardinals feel the weight of his foreboding statement: “You chose a pope you didn’t know.” Belardo has acquired grit as a antagonist. By episode four his political maneuvering has rendered him almost unrecognizable and made his conservatism all the more threatening. He delivers an egotistical press release through the mouth of Sister Mary, and after that, the last voice of supposed reason disappears. Belardo appears to have buckled down and started playing the long game. This growth has enabled a more intricate plotline and the show feels less avant-garde and more watchable. “The Young Pope” really finds its footing this week.
In episode three, the show slowly lets go of its indulgent camera work and electronic score in favor of simpler shots and a preference for sixties hippie rock. The show settles on its title sequence: Lenny Belardo strutting to “All Along the Watchtower.” He smiles to himself while being tailed by a comet in the paintings behind him. This visual might be the most compelling scene of the show. Episode two is dominated by the aggressively sacrilegious montage of Belardo getting dressed in his papal wardrobe to LMFAO’s “Sexy and I Know It.” That scene easily fell on the more contrived side of the thin line “The Young Pope” has been toeing. The title sequence, however, is much more tongue-in-cheek and harkens back to Belardo’s hippie parents, the origin of his staunch conservatism.
A variety of plots are in motion: Belardo has Sister Mary address the press with a statement that nearly claims absolute sovereignty. When chaos erupts among the reporters, no questions are answered (sounds familiar). Belardo is introduced to the tempting Esther, a wife of one of the pontifical guards, and confronts his spiritual father—Cardinal Spencer. These storylines are familiar and temper the strangeness of the show, allowing it to strike a balance between its experimental aspects and its enjoyability. The more conventional plot allows the viewer to explore the connections director Paolo Sorrentino draws between his show and the current political climate.
The show also begins to explore the relationships and physical attractions that come with having a pope less than half a century old. Belardo’s interactions with Esther continue to grow, and the attractive female Prime Minister of Greenland’s arrival allows Belardo to enjoy his ultimate unattainability. Belardo is far from sexless, as revealed by his stories about his first and only girlfriend. However, he appears to gladly forsake physical relations to relish his narcissism. An exploration of romantic or sexual repression seemed inevitable, so it is both satisfying and cliche to see it addressed early on.
In temperament if not in policy, Belardo drastically changes to fit the role of pope. Despite his feeling of scorn for his own more humane actions, he cordially baptizes infants, ships a nun’s sister's body to Vatican City for burial (admittedly he did tell the nun to stop crying at the funeral, but small steps) and did not suffer admonishment from Sister Mary. In a bizarre scene, he prays (rather demandingly) that Esther and her husband (both sterile) will be able to conceive. It appears that the young pope is becoming more cunning—like your standard villain. However, in a show in which a pope in a white tracksuit can run into a kangaroo in a hedge maze, “standard” is still far from ordinary.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 3, 2017 at 5:34 p.m.
Harvard has joined seven other higher education institutions in filing an amicus brief challenging President Donald Trump’s executive order suspending immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations.
In the brief, filed Friday morning, Harvard and the other universities—Boston College, Boston University, Brandeis, MIT, Northeastern, Tufts, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute—argue that the ability of students and scholars to travel across borders is essential to their educational mission.
“It is essential that our commitments to national security not unduly stifle the free flow of ideas and people that are critical to progress in a democratic society,” the brief reads. The filing argues that Trump’s order “undermines the values and contributions of open academic exchange and collaboration.”
The schools are filing as amici in an existing suit against Trump filed Saturday by two Iranian engineering professors at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth who were detained at Logan Airport in Boston the weekend after Trump’s executive order took effect. The lawsuit lists Trump and the United States Department of Homeland Security among its respondents.

The state of Massachusetts numbers among the other parties that have joined the suit.
Harvard is home to 49 students and 62 scholars who have non-immigrant visas from the seven countries targeted by the executive order, according to the brief.
Robert W. Iuliano ’83, Harvard's general counsel and senior vice president, wrote in an emailed statement Friday that Harvard chose to add its name to the brief because it is “important to have our voice heard” on the detrimental effects of Trump’s immigration suspension in Massachusetts.
“The brief provides concrete illustrations of the importance of international students and scholars to our mission and the tangible consequences of the executive order on members of our community and to Harvard as  whole,” he wrote.
Trump’s executive order, which Trump signed Jan. 27, suspends immigration from seven predominantly Muslim nations for 90 days and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely. To date, at least four Harvard affiliates have been prevented from entering the country due to Trump’s new policy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Corey Johnson three with just over two minutes to play capped off a 13-2 Crimson run and proved to be the final nail in Penn’s coffin as the Harvard men’s basketball team pulled out a 69-59 win on Friday night at Lavietes Pavilion. The run gave the Crimson an eight-point edge that the Quakers would not cut to fewer than six down the final stretch. The 10-point margin of victory was the largest lead of the night for Harvard (12-6, 4-1 Ivy League) in a contest that was within three points either way for most of the second frame.
“Basically we talked before the game and talked about delivering the first punch, but Penn did a great job of making tough shots,” Johnson said. “We never felt worried, we knew we had the potential to come back, it was just a matter of digging down and just doing it.”
Much like Dartmouth did two weekends ago, Penn (7-10, 0-4) hit a three to beat the buzzer before intermission and give the guests a lead going into halftime. The Crimson was trailing at halftime for the fourth consecutive game but the three-point deficit paled in comparison to the 15-point one that the Quakers held less than eight minutes into the contest. As the shots started falling for Harvard after a cold start to the evening, the defense continued to hold serve.
“Things picked up a little bit once we saw the ball go in the basket a few times,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “We put ourselves back into it, or least we felt like we were settled having made a few baskets. I just thought that that was the key there. And our defense. That has been our calling card since we’ve been here in this program.”
The comeback run wasn’t particularly pretty from a shooting point of view. It lasted more than five minutes and was highlighted by an and-one by co-captain Siyani Chambers and offensive rebounds from senior center Zena Edosomwan, with Johnson’s two threes as the only converted jumpers.
However, the defense during the stretch was a chapter pulled straight from the Tommy Amaker How-To Guide. The Crimson held Penn to two points on 0-for-4 shooting over a nearly six-minute stretch in which Harvard forced four turnovers. On the evening, the hosts had 11 steals, with Chambers leading the way with four. It was the second game in a row that the Crimson held an opponent to fewer than 25 points in the second half.
Unfortunately for Harvard, the game was no cakewalk. Despite outscoring the Quakers 65-40 over the game’s final 32:10, a horrid start on both ends of the floor kept the game interesting. Penn did not resemble a winless Ivy League team when it came out of the gates, making seven of its first eight shots and consistently beating Harvard off the dribble.
From the jump, the Crimson looked more like the team that was trailing Columbia by 15 at halftime last Saturday than the one that cut that lead to two and held the Lions to 28.6 percent shooting in the second half. To make matters worse, the woes that plagued Harvard point guards Chambers and freshman Bryce Aiken six days earlier continued against Penn. After missing its first four shots, the duo have converted just two of its last 24 field goal attempts over the last two games.
However, the Quakers would cool off, ensuring that Harvard would not need another frantic second half comeback.
“I guess we’d like to overcome it in the first half so in the second half it’s a closer game but it’s really just about not letting it happen,” Johnson said. “We really just have to lock in. The past couple of games the starts of our games haven’t been the best, especially on the defensive end so we have to clean that up. But we did a great job of honing in on things we need to to get back in the game.”
The chipping away began with an Edosomwan free throw, a fitting way to start on a night in which the senior did a little bit of everything for the Crimson. In 20 minutes of action, Edosomwan had seven points on 3-of-5 shooting, grabbed 11 rebounds, and had five blocks.
Perhaps more importantly was what didn’t show up on the statline—his composure and his defense. With the result still in question with just over nine minutes to play, Aiken began to show his frustration after he was called for an offensive foul. Edosomwan grabbed his teammate, visibly calming the first-year down.
“The veterans and the seniors—that’s why our program has been good and successful,” Amaker said. “When you have players within the program that can see things and correct things, then you know it’s not always on the coaches to do those things.”
Just a minute and a half later, Harvard began its run with Edosomwan holding down the paint. The Los Angeles native teamed up with freshmen Chris Lewis and Robert Baker to shut down Penn freshman A.J. Brodeur, holding the forward to seven points on 3-of-10 shooting on a night when he turned the ball over six times.
Brodeur was not the only Penn player the Crimson put in tough spots on offense. After making seven of its first eight field goals, the Quakers missed 35 of their final 49.
Harvard for its part took 30 three pointers and only 33 twos. For the second game in a row, the long balls were not falling for Harvard players not named Corey Johnson. While Johnson has made 11 over the last two games, the rest of the team is 8-for-46 from long range.
“We took 30 threes tonight and if those are the ones we get, we’re going to take them,” Amaker said. “We have to kind of stay with who we are. We are not a team right now that scores a lot on the interior, so we have to take advantage of what we are and who we are and if those shots are there, we have to take them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Another night in the Ivy League,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “It never ceases to amaze me how our league, how the games can be in league play and how hard it is, challenging.”
Despite facing off against a Penn team that entered Friday’s contest without a conference win, the Quakers (7-10, 0-4 Ivy League) would force Harvard (12-6, 4-1) to play a full 40 minutes of basketball at Lavietes Pavilion.
For the Crimson, though, it ultimately came down to overcoming another difficult start and locking down on defense late. In a game that saw seven lead changes, Harvard’s play down the stretch and timely free throw shooting gave the Crimson the lead it would need to take down the Penn, 69-59.
ANOTHER TOUGH START
Just over five minutes into the first half one thing was clear—Penn had come to play. For the third game in a row, Harvard saw itself down early and by a significant margin. Through these five minutes, the Crimson only scored twice and turned the ball over as many times. For their part, the Quakers had only missed one shot and had taken a dominant 17-4 lead.
“I don’t remember them missing a shot at the beginning of the game so that was great for them but we didn’t really lock in on defense like we said we were going to,” sophomore guard Corey Johnson said. “We didn’t rotate well, we weren’t rebounding.”
Coming off games against Cornell and Columbia where Harvard entered the half down by seven and fifteen at the half, respectively, Friday’s game looked like it was shaping up to be another late comeback from the Crimson.
This time around, however, Harvard didn’t wait until the second half to respond.
After starting the half 2-of-11 from the field, the Crimson rallied late to take a lead with just under three minutes left in the clock. For a Harvard, it was ultimately late defense that came through to turn a deficit as high as 15 into a three point lead with just over two minutes on the clock. The Crimson forced 10 turnovers on four steals to crawl back into the game late in the first half.
After going down 19-4 the Crimson would string together a 30-12 run to end the frame. Despite the tough early shooting, Harvard ended the half shooting 47 percent from the field.
“Things picked up a little bit once we saw the ball go in the basket a few times,” Amaker said. “We put ourselves back into it, or least we felt like we were settled having made a few baskets.”
DEPTH AND DEFENSE
Coach Amaker has stressed the depth of his team and his bench throughout the season. Friday night’s game was no exception to the rule. On the game, 11 players saw the floor and five of the Crimson’s players were in double digits. Lead by senior guard Siyani Chambers, who finished with 13 points, 6 assists, and four steals, the Crimson stayed composed late despite the early deficit.
“I just thought that [defense] was the key there,” Amaker said. “That has been our calling card since we’ve been here in this program and to hold that team in the second half with that shooting percentage...We’ve experienced that ourselves before, particularly on the road.”
While Harvard relied on its depth, Penn was looking to freshman forward AJ Brodeur much like it has throughout the season. The rookie came in averaging over 15 points and nearly seven rebounds per game. On Friday, however, the Crimson found a way to keep Brodeur at bay.
Defended mostly by senior forward Zena Edosomwan and freshman Chris Lewis, Brodeur was held to seven points and five rebounds on 3-of-10 shooting from the field. He would also turn the ball over six times.
Ultimately, the win came down to defense. While the Harvard shot only 36 percent through the second frame, they held the Quakers to a tough 21 percent clip through the same frame. In the last 20 minutes of play, Penn would go 1-for-14 from beyond the arc.
“I think we just picked up our defensive intensity,” freshman guard Justin Bassey said. “We started picking up further up the court and a lot of that starts with Siyani for us. Having him pressure the ball and making it hard for them to bring it all the way up and initiate their offense.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 4, 2017, at 9:36 a.m.
Monday night, the No. 5/6 Harvard men’s hockey team will look to advance to its first Beanpot championship game in nine years—a necessary step in the quest to win back the highly coveted trophy that’s eluded the Crimson since 1993.
Harvard’s contest just three days prior against Dartmouth, a team in the bottom half of both the ECAC and Ivy League standings, didn’t exactly have the same ring to it.
Given the circumstances, a shortage of focus from Harvard throughout its Beanpot antecedent Friday night really wouldn’t have been all that surprising. However, after the Big Green’s 8-4 drubbing of the Crimson last month, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 made it clear that Dartmouth had his team’s attention.
Sure enough, the rematch bore little resemblance to the Crimson’s nightmare in Hanover, N.H. Behind a three-point effort from senior Sean Malone and 28 saves from junior goaltender Merrick Madsen, the Crimson earned its revenge in the form of a 5-2 victory over the Big Green at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center.
“When we played them in our building, I think we caught them early,” Dartmouth coach Bob Gaudet said. “We were very opportunistic and put some pucks behind them, and when we got up, it was a much different game. We were able to slow them down. But not tonight.”
Taking advantage of its speed, Harvard (15-5-2, 11-4-2 ECAC) scored five goals for the first time in eight games after having accomplished the same feat nine times in its first 14 outings. The Crimson now has won three straight games, the latest of which temporarily pushes Harvard into second place ahead of Union in the ECAC.
Back centering the Crimson’s second line as a result of Donato’s latest line shuffling, Malone led the charge with a goal in the first period and another in the third, helping Harvard open up a 3-0 lead. Unlike in Hanover when the Crimson saw a 2-0 lead evaporate rather quickly, Harvard then buckled down to protect its advantage.
“I thought we were determined to take care of the puck a lot better than the last time we played them,” Donato said. “I liked our start. I thought we were playing with a good tempo.”
Nonetheless, the Big Green (8-12-3, 5-9-2) couldn’t leave Cambridge without making things interesting. With 12:13 remaining in the third and the Crimson leading 4-1, Harvard junior Jake Horton received a major penalty and a game misconduct for hitting Dartmouth’s Clay Han from behind, leaving the hosts shorthanded for five minutes. And it was only a matter of seconds before the visitors pounced.
Associate captain Josh Hartley’s blast from the point 15 seconds into the permanent power play pulled the Big Green within two. Then just a minute later, Malone tripped freshman Daniel Warpecha, giving Dartmouth a potential chance to skate 5-on-3.
But that opportunity never came to fruition, as the referees also sent Warpecha to the box for embellishment—the first in a series of bad breaks for the Big Green that transpired over its final three-plus minutes on the man advantage.
Dartmouth’s next bit of ill fortune came after an ordinary zone entry produced a favorable carom off the end boards that left junior Kevin Neiley staring at an open Harvard net. Before the fourth-liner could pull the Big Green within one, freshman defenseman John Marino lunged in with his stick to make one of the biggest stops of the night.
“It sucks when you get a five-minute major like that in the third period, but little things like blocked shots and clears can get your bench going again,” Malone said.
In the wake of Marino’s blocked shot and two Madsen saves later, co-captain Alexander Kerfoot broke out on a 2-on-1 with sophomore Ryan Donato as the penalty expired. Kerfoot opted to shoot, and the co-captain consequently put the Crimson’s fifth puck past Devin Buffalo with 7:06 remaining.
Buffalo did make 34 saves on the night, but the junior goaltender was beat at least once in every period. Malone broke open the scoring at 11:36 in the first after senior defenseman Clay Anderson made one of his better plays of the season, generating a steal in the attacking zone and setting up the Sabres draft pick perfectly in the slot.
Horton doubled the lead down low 8:06 into the second, capitalizing on a pair of wacky bounces—one off the stick of Buffalo and another off the stick of Luke Esposito—to punch in his third goal in as many games.
Malone kept at it in the third, scoring from his knees after being tripped up by Tim Shoup in the slot at 1:39. That goal put Harvard up 3-0, and his point drive that was tipped in by Esposito six minutes later upped the Crimson's edge to 4-1.
The two seniors were back together on the second line Friday for the first time in three games, as Ted Donato opted to revert back to the lines that he'd been rolling out all season up until the Dartmouth debacle.
“You can see some chemistry with those guys,” Ted Donato said. “When we get [our top two] lines going and the other two lines working like they were… it’s really the type of teamwork we need to win.”
The lines did feature some moderations since Donato revealed that junior Seb Lloyd and freshmen Nathan Krusko and Frederic Gregoire all went down with injuries in practice this week. But the retreat to the structure of old seems to suggest that Harvard might take a similar approach with its lineup against Northeastern when the Beanpot kicks off on Monday.
The wait is on.
GAME NOTES
—Harvard has jumped two spots to sixth in the PairWise rankings.
—Out of the three players who were injured in practice this week, Ted Donato said two would likely be out past Monday while one would have a chance to be available against Northeastern. The coach did not specify which timetables applied to which players, but Nathan Krusko was initially included in the Crimson's lineup on Friday (before being lifted in favor of extra skater Eddie Ellis), suggesting that Krusko is most likely the one who has a chance to suit up for the Beanpot's opening round.
—Despite generating as many as 14 shots on the power play, Harvard finished 0-for-5 on the man advantage. Now just 1-for-13 over its last four games, the Crimson has dropped to third in the country behind Ohio State and Northeastern in power-play efficiency (26.3 percent).
—Freshman defenseman Adam Fox came away with his first two-point night in nine games by way of two secondary assists against the Big Green. Fox had accumulated six multi-point outings in his first 12 collegiate games. Among defensemen, he leads the nation in both points per game and assists per game.
—Sean Malone, a Buffalo Sabres prospect and more importantly a product of West Senaca, N.Y., 'shockingly' will not be rooting for the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl on Sunday, he revealed after the game.
