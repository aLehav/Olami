Walking into “The Rocky Horror Show,” the musical upon which the infamous cult film, “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” is based, audiences more or less know what to expect: silly names, comedic horror, and blatantly sexual songs and dance numbers. But predictability doesn’t detract from the experience of the show; it only emphasizes the importance of each individual production’s audiovisual spectacle to its success.
Accordingly, the Harvard-Radcliffe Summer Theater production, directed by Matthew C. Stone ’11, a Crimson arts writer, was one of the more spectacular shows put on in the Loeb Experimental Theater in recent years. The musical—which played two revival performances on September 1 and 2—made the fullest possible use of the Ex’s spare black box space, employing elements like film and graffiti outside the theater to draw its audience in.
The kitsch started early with previews for films like “It Came From Outer Space” (“Sights never before seen by human eyes!”) and “Dracula” (“Back from the grave, back to thrill you and chill you!”) projected onto the curtain pre-show. Then, a scantily-dressed usherette (Meagan A. Michelson ’10) introduced the show with a come-hither rendition of “Science Fiction/Double Feature,” exhorting the audience to come see a “late-night double-feature picture show.”
The plot of the show itself is simple enough: a newly-engaged couple—the middle-class, decidedly dull Brad (Stone) and Janet (Bridget P. Haile ’11)—suffer a busted tire on the highway and are forced to seek help at an ominous-looking mansion inhabited by mad scientist/transvestite Dr. Frank N. Furter (Roy A. Kimmey III ’09) and his equally strange servants. From that point on, mischief ensues, as the pair are drawn into a world of sexual debauchery, violence, and intrigue—all played out, of course, through darkly comical songs and dance routines.
That description alone makes it clear why the production depends in great measure on the full-throttle enthusiasm of the actors. The plot is wispy at best, with minimal exposition, and the set-up is so ludicrous that the whole façade threatens to collapse into embarrassing self-parody if the performers fail to embrace it. Fortunately, the cast of this rendition by and large took up the challenge. Though the individual singing and acting varied in quality, every actor crooned and gyrated around the stage with enough gusto to compensate.
The acting, secondary though it was, did have its high points as well. Haile as Janet in particular nailed her transition from naïve, simpering girl to confident, hypersexual woman—especially in standout tune “Touch-A, Touch Me,” in which she describes her sexual awakening. Kimmey’s Frank N. Furter was over-the-top almost to a fault, but like many elements in the production, was saved by the sheer passion of his performance. Some of the actors had trouble finding the right tone for the spoken sections of the show, and as a result came off disconcertingly earnest. But more often than not, the cast hit the comedic sweet spot.
Some of the best comedy came from the show’s famed audience participation, in which fans yell lines in response to the action onstage. In this case—lacking the built-in crowd of fanatics—most of it was clearly simulated, the invention of production staff planted in and around the seats. Nonetheless, the audience’s heckling of Brad and Janet provided some of the show’s biggest laughs. After Janet tells Brad, “I’m coming with you,” one audience member crowed, “That’ll be a first!” However, some of the participation did seem genuine; the crowd responded unhesitatingly to an early request to “Give me an R! Give me an O!” and so on.
Musically, the show had high and low points. The cast’s interpretation of the musical’s most famous tune, “The Time Warp,” was one of the former, with chaotic solo dance routines and an energetic chorus of “Let’s do the time warp again!” But other songs, like “Eddie’s Teddy,” didn’t have quite enough laughs to balance out the sheer silliness of the music. That problem wasn’t helped by some technical difficulties with the microphones, which caused many lyrics to be unintelligible.
“Rocky Horror” needs to be spectacular to work, and this production aimed high with extravagantly sexual dance routines and jazzy live-band accompaniment. Unfortunately, it didn’t always keep up the tempo. When the all-singing, all-dancing spectacle died down, the show felt a little flat. The rest of the time, though, this production was campy, over-the-top, and plenty of fun, exactly like “Rocky Horror” should be.

Although initially performing as a pianist strictly with jazz techniques, Eric Lewis, known professonially as ELEW, has expanded the traditional limits of a jazz musician’s repertoire with a radical style of playing he calls “Rockjazz.” The genre eschews the divide between mainstream and jazz music. His haunting renditions of well-known heavy metal, pop, and alternative rock tunes, such as Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” showcase the musician’s predilection for unconventional harmonies and performance styles, such as playing not only the keys of a piano but reaching inside the instrument to experiment with the effects of strumming its strings.
ELEW's star is certainly on the rise, as he performs with established musicians like Sting on stages all over the globe. Next on his growing list of appearances is Harvard where, on September 15, ELEW will perform and participate in an informal conversation with students as part of “Conversations with Kirkland,” a student-driven series that fosters dialogue between undergraduates and accomplished artists and professionals in a variety of fields.
The Harvard Crimson: How would you define “Rockjazz” to someone unfamiliar with your work?
ELEW: “Rockjazz” has everything to do with focusing on more than just the sound of rock music but the drama and style of rock.. It is about focusing on the culture of rock and bringing it into the jazz world.
THC: How do you select the songs that you choose to cover?
ELEW: I generally choose songs based upon their lyrics, architecture, and popularity. With popular tunes, a lot of the communication is already done so that when I get to my improvisations, the audience can appreciate what I’ve done. However, one of the strongest criteria is also the lyrics, because my journey as a jazz pianist to a rock player was an emotional one. In the jazz world, there weren’t any songs lyrically that spoke to the psychological aspects of my emotions. But my feelings of stress, anger, and betrayal led the way to the transparency of those emotions in a song like “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” These kinds of lyrics spoke to a part of my life experience that jazz lyrics never spoke to.
THC: You have performed in a variety of venues throughout your career, from large concert halls to Bloomingdales. What was it like to play in the White House?
ELEW: It was a surrealistic experience. Michelle Obama was glorious, and Barack Obama was amazing. I had a chance to shake his hand, look him in the eye. I gave the First Lady a clutch bag as a gift thanking her for allowing me be a participant in the [performance]. She was very supportive of me. What can I say? It’s one of those pieces of eternity that I can behold and have reflections of nostalgia and gratitude.
THC: As your profile rises, you have been attracting a lot of corporate attention from companies such as Google, Coca Cola, FedEx, and Proctor & Gamble. How do you respond to critics who might denounce your credibility as an artist for attracting so much mainstream popularity?
ELEW: The notion of “selling out” is a very popular stigma. When it comes to the subjectivity of being perceived as “selling out,” there are a few different ways that I can come at that. I can say that it is just naïve. Everyone buys and everyone sells. Another approach would be to say that the moment any artist leaves their parents’ home and starts to charge money for their performances, even if it’s a dollar, they just became a businessperson. Classically, artists are so in denial of being businesspeople that they stigmatize it to being something that is negative. They adopt the Vincent van Gogh model because they all romanticize a guy who was never able to sell a painting and cut off his ear in frustration. But then after his passing he was discovered to be a genius. So many of these people who talk about selling out are deep down hoping for or romanticizing the belief that after they are gone they are going to be important.
THC: Where do you see the future of “Rockjazz” and how that genre might influence other artists in their approach to music making?
ELEW: Well, “Rockjazz” is very personal. It’s my term for what I do and what I observe as my style. We will see what generations of musicians decide to do or not to do with it.
THC: What do you hope to gain from visiting Harvard and interacting with students through the “Conversations at Kirkland” event?
ELEW: One of the big functions of academic institutions was to provide an area where different ideas and concepts can collide. The overall process of collision, meaning the destruction of lesser ideas or the weaker ones in a sort of Darwinian type of evolution of ideas, is a positive strength that leads to innovation and to progress. So, I look forward to colliding with the different minds there. I’m sure there will be interesting conversations and perhaps disagreements, and I’m hoping to collide and see what we can come up with. I’m sure we will all come away with some positive progress.

At this year’s Convocation, President Drew Faust advised the class of 2014 to “find that part of you that will take a chance on an idea or an ideal, the part of you that is willing to fail.” It was, essentially, a throwaway statement: completely uncontroversial, intended to encourage the class’s diversity of thought. But Faust’s remark was possibly more perceptive than intended. Certainly there is enough noise about maintaining a spread of ideas—but how often does anyone question the worth, or note the dangers, of abstract ideas in themselves? Ideas can lead to failure. Indeed, the Austrian novelist Thomas Bernhard went further—ideas, he thought, lead to destruction. As one of the characters writes in his 1975 novel “Correction,” “We never think with the utmost analytical rigor, because if we did we’d solve, dissolve, everything.” Bernhard’s fixation with how even the most well-intended ideas can—and logically must—end in terror, lends his work freshness that makes it well worth revisiting today.
“Correction” focuses on Roithamer, a brilliant scientist at Cambridge University determined to build a cone-shaped habitation for his sister in the center of Austria’s Kobernausser forest. He works out the proofs in the garret of a taxidermist named Hoeller, whose home is built to perch in a dark gorge over the waters of the Aurach River. After Roithamer’s death—a suicide—a friend from Cambridge arrives at the garret to sort through the posthumous papers. The first half of the book is composed of the narrator’s thoughts; the second half is Roithamer’s manuscript itself.
In some sense Bernhard wrote the same book again and again; his novels are all semi-autobiographical monologues, narrowing in slow revolutions about the same themes: the work-in-progress, the obsessive genius, the suspicion toward “nature.” But it is in “Correction” that these themes develop most obviously. Bernhard’s characteristically long sentences bear the weight of his relentless logic; so hypnotically repetitive is his language that each piece of information arrives with a tiny jolt—like the impression a new idea makes before it melts away into one’s previous conception of the world.
Amidst this claustrophobia, ideas take on a sinister aspect. Bernhard works both within and against the Austrian literary tradition, in which intellectualism is revered for its own sake: think of the ecstatic prose and heady swirl of ideas in novels like “The Magic Mountain” or “Auto-da-Fé.” Mathematics and science are particularly aestheticized, but the content of all ideas almost ceases to matter—so malleable are they that they can be transformed even into their opposites.
Roithamer elevates the concept of building, for instance, into an art form: it is not just architecture, but also psychology, and ethics: “The Cone’s interior corresponded to my sister’s inner being, the Cone’s exterior to her outward being, and together her whole being expressed was the Cone’s character.” The question of statics haunts Roithamer, because the problem of the Cone’s construction is the problem of his sister. When finished, however, the place intended for her happiness is totally isolating; the pressure on his sister’s psychology drains her of the very will to live.
This slow drift into horror occurs within the manuscript, which from a blueprint becomes a reminiscence of Roithamer’s unhappy childhood in Altensam, ultimately predicting his own “self-doomed” death. Roithamer continuously condenses his manuscript to “correct” it, but each time he does so its meaning alters drastically. From the first 800 page draft, he revises it to 300 pages; the third version has only 80. On his journey to attend his sister’s funeral, he begins revising even that draft to a mere 20 pages: “I’d realized that nothing in it expresses the reality as it actually is, the description runs counter to the actuality, but I did not hesitate to correct everything, and in the process of correcting everything, I destroyed everything.”
Some of these ideas come from Wittgenstein, with whom Bernhard was obsessed. The walls of Roithamer’s garret are papered with pages taken from that philosopher, alongside those of Montaigne, Novalis, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Bloch. In his unfinished “Philosophical Investigations” Wittgenstein corrects the views of the earlier “Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus” on language and meaning to the point of overturning them completely. “Correction” is in many ways a thinly veiled fictionalization of both the philosopher (who spent years building a house for his sister) and his ideological reversal.
Then again, the allusions to Western philosophy in which the novel is steeped (Heidegger’s notion of “clearing” as a positive space for being is lampooned, for instance, in Roithamer’s choice of a forest clearing to hang himself) are only another trap. The last notes Roithamer scribbles on some slips of paper are: “in the end nothing matters all that much” and “it’s all the same.” When the narrator catches himself searching for significance in a yellow paper rose, he cuts himself off: “If we keep attaching meanings and mysteries to everything we perceive... we are bound to go crazy sooner or later.” Bernhard avoids description; he uses hardly any adjectives. Yet an undercurrent of “meanings and mysteries” persists despite the absence of anything in the text to suggest it.
Indeed, though Bernhard’s work demonstrates in countless ways the fatal tendency of the idea, even he continued to be enamored by its mysteries. Life void of thought was merely “stupid externals.” His greatest contempt was reserved for Viennese society, which he believed—though outwardly enthralled by ideas—lacked true convictions of its own. The problem for Bernhard was not ideas, but ideas without purpose.
In the liberal West, where it is not uncommon to take on intellectual projects out of convenience rather than true passion, the character best embodying the “age” would be not Roithamer but Ulrich—the protagonist of Robert Musil’s modernist opus “The Man Without Qualities.” Ulrich lacks even what Bernhard calls “the minimum of necessary energy, qualities such as courage, decisiveness, adding up to a spiritual power of decision.” “Correction” is bleak, but it speaks to a secret yearning. What begins as contempt for Roithamer corrects itself into admiration for his ability to pursue his own, self-chosen enthusiasm with near-religious fervor. Whatever the project or its consequences, he has chosen it for himself.

Upon reading Aimee Bender’s “The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake” one is struck with a total inability to remember the protagonist’s name, one symptom of Bender’s ill-formed main character. Which is not to say the work is terrible. While the characters may be vague, the novel’s driving conceit proves memorable: a heroine who can taste the emotions of people in the food they concoct.
While such a power might seem the stuff of superheroes (at least very domestic ones), Bender’s protagonist, Rose, never fully harnesses her gift. Rather, she grapples with its interpersonal and culinary consequences, while dealing with all the stock issues of adolescence: distant parents, academics, and boys. Bender’s decision to focus on young Rose’s development renders the book less eventful than it could have been, but allows for an intimacy of human scale that makes readers’ incredulity stand down.
Such a simple story could easily be enhanced with stark, elegant narration, which Bender seems to be aiming for. This does not happen. Because the book opens with the narrator describing her childhood, the style seems to be that of a five year old. Sadly, the diction and depth of metaphor does not become more complex as the character ages, but rather remains stunted. For example, as a senior in high school, Rose has her first romantic encounter, which she characterizes as “a fight with our lips, but somehow it all still felt pretty good.” That’s one way to put it.
The plot of the novel is rather difficult to pin down; it is as vague and meandering as the work’s narrator. It focuses on Rose’s relationship with her mother and father as her brother succumbs to mental illness. Indeed, much of the book centers on Rose’s brother, Joseph. He proves a more captivating character than his sister, even if his internality is obscured by the limits of Rose’s first-person narration.
That a mentally ill college-dropout is more intriguing and memorable than someone who can taste emotion in food is striking, pointing to just how little Bender does with her major gimmick. Perhaps she should be lauded for not forcing a conventional plot on the work. One could imagine a similar story in which a major corporation discovers Rose’s power and tries to kidnap and exploit her; or one in which Rose becomes a forensic psychologist to solve murders by eating criminal’s cooking. Bender seems committed to working in the magical realist genre, maintaining a total sense of reality, even at the expense of excitement, making the work’s conceit all the more believable. Sadly, the spicy arepas of Márquez and mole of Esquirel are here replaced with reheated spaghetti; the plot lacks the verve and sense of wonder seen in so much Latin American literature of the genre.
In the scattered instances where Bender does focus on Rose’s eating, the novel becomes somewhat more digestible. By focusing on the difficulties of dealing with this superhuman ability, Bender’s story inspires meditation on our relationship with food. While many use eating as an emotional escape, for Rose food brings the cook’s buried emotions to the forefront, or tip of her tongue as the case may be.
As Rose matures, she’s able to place exactly where a certain ingredient comes from based on the emotions it contains, giving rise to the novel’s most intriguing passages. In an age of Whole Foods and obsession with food quality and organic production, Rose’s intimate knowledge of what she eats could be read both as a celebration of our current desire for every facet of information about what we consume or possibly as a critique of the same fixation.
Rose particularly relishes totally processed food, the kind that comes out of vending machines. Untouched by humans, these foods contain none of the sorrow of her mother’s cake, the boredom of a chef’s specialty or any emotion from anyone at all. They go down quick and taste just fine. Rose’s junk food is in fact somewhat like the novel itself. Though it creates little in the way of emotional connection to the book’s character, it at least provides satiation from boredom by its interesting gimmick. Light and distracting, “The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake” is merely a snack between more substantial meals.

Throughout September, the Harvard Film Archive (HFA) will screen “The Complete Pier Paolo Pasolini,” a series comprised of the thirteen features and five short films directed by one of the most controversial and important intellectuals of the twentieth century. According HFA programmer David Pendleton, “There is nobody like Pasolini in the American context. He is someone who is up there with Godard and Eisenstien, someone whose formal experimentation goes hand in hand with a coherent philosophy and ideology about the world.”
Pasolini’s first contact with cinema was in 1957, when he collaborated with his friend Federico Fellini on “Nights of Cabiria.” By the time Pasolini directed his first film, “Accatone,” he had already become famous as a poet, screenwriter and critic. But for so critically acclaimed a director, the opportunity to see prints of his films is rather difficult. This is largely because there are no well-made English subtitled Pasolini prints stored anywhere in the United States. In order to get their prints, the HFA established a relationship with the Pasolini Fund, and then imported the films from the Cinemateca in Bologna.
Moreover, it is vital to see Pasolini’s visuals on the big screen. “This way you can appreciate both the beauty of the film and the strategy with which Pasolini frames his shots,” Pendleton says. In his films, Pasolini highlights base reality, but he frames his shots using the aesthetics of great Renaissance and Baroque painters, such as Masaccio, Caravaggio, and Giotto. According to Pendleton, the projection of his films will reveal that certain shots look surprisingly similar to famous Italian paintings.
As noted, Pasolini’s goal as a filmmaker was to directly show reality as it was, in all its sex, violence, cruelty, and injustice, and, simultaneously, to open the viewers’ eyes to the poetic aspects it contains. Pasolini said in an interview in the 1960s, “I love cinema because through cinema I always stay at the level of reality.” To construct his films in as authentic a manner as possible, he used very few professional actors, and allowed the people he filmed to speak the everyday language of their own region. At a time when Mussolini was forcing his citizens to use a standardized version of Italian, Pasolini openly declared that he loved differing Italian dialects just as much as he loved the work of Dante.
Pasolini lived in an Italy that changed rapidly during an economic boom that started in the 1950s, and the industrialism and consumerism that followed. As this Italy was developing a conformist mass-culture, Pasolini was especially interested in revealing the fragments of reality that were censored or suppressed by the dominant ideology of the time. He remains famous for filming Italy not as it should have been, but as it was, including the Italy of those who stood at the fringes of society.
Pendleton says, “He was interested in the outsider—not the heroic working class [which Italian neorealism championed], but the people who are not even looking for work and live off of petty thefts.”
The director also promoted “natural sacredness,” the idea that the world, including every single being, is holy in and of itself. In “Arabian Nights,” he shows that all bodies are sacred and have an innocent eroticism. In films such as “Ricotta” and “The Gospel According to Matthew” he shows that there is more spirituality in nature and regular people than there could ever be in organized religion.
Atheist, homosexual, and never hesitant to express an alternate viewpoint, Pasolini was always a scandalous figure. He recognized the importance of scandal in its ability to reveal what no one wants to know; the aspects of themselves that people want to keep hidden. He always described the world from an eccentric point of view, not consistent with the mainstream cultural, political, or religious views of his era. As a result, he has been constantly insulted, denigrated, and accused. But he never considered himself a victim. According to Walter Valeri, a former Harvard Italian teaching fellow who knew Pasolini personally, “Pasolini was a happy man, filled with humanity, warmth, and affection. He did have a critical judgment on society, but he was not a bit arrogant.”
This HFA series is a remarkable panorama that will give viewers the sense of Pasolini’s whole range as an auteur.  It lets viewers appreciate Pasolini’s early directing style which has a strong neorealist character and then observe his transition to a completely different aesthetics whose diversity alone speak to Pasolini as a unique creative force. Valeri advises, “It is important to not judge the films right away. Rather, let the images seep inside you, like the words of a poem. His images can’t be immediately consumed or labeled as beautiful or ugly, but they will stay in your memory and keep growing and developing for years after.”

For Leonardo Dicaprio, “Inception” was an opportunity to reestablish his brand. Dicaprio’s turn as a troubled U.S. Marshal in “Shutter Island” was made up of brooding stares and mental breakdowns that garnered little more than shrugs from many viewers. This time around, both the brooding and breakdowns remain, but the result is infinitely more satisfying, fueled literally by the stuff of dreams.
Although Dicaprio’s acting in both films is consistent, his work in “Inception” is elevated by the stellar vision of director Christopher Nolan (director of “Memento” and, lately, “The Dark Knight”), a phenomenal supporting cast, and the added benefit that this film’s aesthetic compliments the actor’s own suave style. And “Inception” is about as suave as it gets.
This visually stunning movie takes place in a world in which individuals, especially powerful ones, have to worry about a new kind of breaking and entering: where human minds, not mainframes or security vaults, are the target. Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb, a specialist who has the ability to delve into people’s dreams and physically extract the secrets they store within them. Naturally, he uses this talent is the service of international corporate espionage, and in so doing has garnered a hefty list of powerful enemies, not to mention a series of personal tragedies along the way.
Given the option to leave his fugitive lifestyle behind for good, Cobb embarks on one last job, to perform not an extraction, but an inception—the planting of an idea that will fundamentally alter the dreamer’s thought processes upon waking.
Cobb is accompanied by a crew of extremely debonair and crafty dream weavers. Standouts from the group include the irreverent duo of Arthur and Eames, played respectively by Joseph Gordon-Levitt (with a decidedly more kick-ass flair than he showed in “500 Days of Summer”) and relative newcomer Tom Hardy, who brings a quick-witted charm to the screen. Like the movie itself, each of these characters is striking, dressed and groomed with an artful precision. It’s all impeccably tailored suits and slicked-back hair in this joint.
Their polished looks are complemented by Wally Pfister’s gorgeous cinematography, one of the film’s most distinctive traits. From sweeping landscapes to action-packed fight scenes, every shot is crisp and captivating, whether it’s an avalanche cascading across the path of a snow mobile chase, or a gravity-defying fight scene in a hotel corridor.
Nolan deftly utilizes a complexly-designed system of internal logic coupled with arresting imagery to make “Inception” both an understandable and entertaining escape from the world of the waking to that of the imagined. The tension between the dream and the physical worlds comprises the crux of the plot, and ultimately holds the success of the film in the balance. Rather than being bogged down by the complexities of shifting between the two dimensions, the story revels in forcing the audience to keep up with the chain of events and reactions. It’s a thrilling joyride, and all in the state of REM sleep to boot.
But while the film succeeds in combining the wonder and freedom of a dream, and in translating those feelings into a real experience on screen, its primary weakness is that Nolan doesn’t take this opportunity as far as he could have. Rarely eschewing its James Bond-ian adventure and heist film foundations, “Inception” presents an illusory alternate universe that really isn’t so different from our own—apart from a few select instances, the film never presents a completely outlandish dreamscape. In short, it’s missing the unpredictability of the unconscious, despite being consciously enticing.
This shortcoming aside, Nolan has crafted a brilliant movie that tests the minds of the audience and probes into those of the characters.

A horde of barbarians are crucifying a priest on his church’s cross in a blasphemous expression of inchoate, murderous rage as “Machete” co-writers and directors Robert Rodriguez and Ethan Maniquiz depict present day life in Austin, Texas with a brutal fury more appropriate for ancient Rome. A feature-length adaptation of a mock-trailer preceding “Grindhouse,” Rodriguez’s 2007 collaboration with Quentin Tarantino, “Machete” is undeniably aggressive, exploitative, and gratuitous. But at the same time, it’s brilliant.
Focusing on the problems of illegal immigration and the growing influence of Mexican drug cartels, every element of the movie is exaggerated: the evil is pure, condensed, and particularly despicable, while the forces of good are fearless, charismatic, and attractive. Rodriguez and Maniquiz mock the Texan mystique, caricaturing cowboys as violently intolerant hypocrites. But since the film is so clearly ridiculous (the main character’s preferred weapon is, of course, a machete), one must forgive the lack of nuanced character development. Instead, the film is designed as a vehicle of pure amusement, with a decadent display of gratuitous bloodshed and complete dereliction of moral rectitude.
Danny Trejo’s titular character carries himself throughout the movie with the calm of absolute physical power. The film doesn’t do him any aesthetic favors. Throughout the majority of the film, his face is covered in white tape to cover his oozing wounds, his skin is pockmarked, his hair is lank, and his gait is staggering. Despite all this, he’s the charismatic core of the film. Against him, everyone else seems nervous and frenetic as he slashes his way from one scene to the next with single-minded, lethal aplomb.
One gets the sense that Machete doesn’t read much (he doesn’t even like to text), but he’s definitely smart. For example, as he lies in a hospital bed, he learns from a doctor that human intestines are about sixty feet long. He has absorbed and found a way to employ that information within ten minutes. In an example of innovation at its finest, he uses a still-breathing, would-be assassin’s intestines as a rope with which to flee from the hospital window. Such dynamism serves Machete, and the film, well.
Trejo is surrounded by actors who play well off him, notably Michelle Rodriguez, who has finally found an environment in which her perpetual scowl is both appropriate and laudable, and Jessica Alba, who somehow manages to look sweet even as she stabs out a man’s eye with her stilettos.
The unfortunate Lindsay Lohan also finds herself in the movie, though she does little other than spend time looking world-weary and being naked. Maniquiz and Rodriguez are masters of camp, handling their material so deftly as to inspire ironic laughter with the film, instead of at the film. Lohan has become such a camp figure herself, having lost whatever shred of autonomy and dignity she ever had to tabloids long ago, that she threatens the fine balance of the scenes she is in. Despite her talents as an actress, it’s hard to separate her perceived public identity from her character in the film, especially when that character decides to frequent crack dens and engage in threesomes with her mother.
“Machete” also loses a bit of its forward momentum at its climax, a battle scene between the ranged forces of good and evil, as represented by the so-called “Network” of illegal immigrants and hostile Texans, respectively. By this point, it’s clear that Machete will have to win. Any other alternative would strongly clash with the film’s joyfully simplistic sense of right and wrong. So the film loses its sense of earlier dynamic urgency when the audience isn’t sure whether Machete will be able to decapitate his way out of every situation.  By the film’s conclusion, it’s clear that he surely will. Nevertheless, “Machete” maintains an incredible level of energy as it careens towards its somewhat predictable conclusion.
“Machete” is rich in humorous detail and provides a satisfying narrative arc. For those reasons alone, it rises far above its current cinematic competition. And even when the violence reaches such hyperbolic extremes that one has to laugh, in spite of one’s self, it is important to remember that there is a remarkably well-made film hidden beneath the entrails.

Deeply rural America can still feel, at its heart, like a wild country, and Debra Granik’s adaptation of Daniel Woodrell’s novel “Winter’s Bone” pierces through the folklore and nostalgia of the backcountry to chronicle a stark test of survival in the Ozarks. Granik’s film, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival this year, features direction as stoic as the protagonist. “Winter’s Bone” is beautifully bleak, a marvel because of its unflinching commitment to the relentless realism that always accompanies endurance.
“Winter’s Bone” centers around the small, drug-ridden, clannish world of southwestern Missouri, where cold, harsh people are an even more difficult force to deal with than nature itself. Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) is a seventeen-year-old girl who takes care of her two siblings. She also takes care of her mother who has simply given up, driven into insanity or despair by her life. Ree barely scrapes together enough to keep her family afloat. She shoots and skins squirrels for soup, and relies on handouts from her next-door neighbor Sonya (Shelley Wagener). But Ree, like the other inhabitants of this bleak landscape, is proud and determined never to seem needy, a “bred and buttered” part of the Dolly clan that boasts members such as her father, Jessup, who has been serving time in prison for cooking up crystal meth, and his brother, Teardrop (John Hawkes), a former dealer and sinister coke fiend.
Ree’s precarious grasp on a livelihood begins to falter when a slick city car pulls up under her porch. When she emerges suspiciously, gun in hand, a repo man jumps out and explains that her father, who has been let out of prison on bail, has put their house up for collateral and has gone missing. If he doesn’t show up for his court date, the family must forfeit the house, and Ree’s only chances of supporting her family will be gone. Lawrence, magnificent in her portrayal of weary, iron-willed Ree, barely blinks at this news, though her stony eyes speak volumes about her despair. Ree’s only way to survive is to find Jessup, or prove that he’s dead—a task that she has to carry out utterly alone.
Granik’s film is exceptional in its portrayal of flinty, unyielding communities. The morals at work in the story are not sentimental; they are as cold and foreboding as the wintertime Ozarks themselves. Codes of honor as strict as those of a Greek tragedy still operate among the families who live near Ree, and blood feuds run for generations. Men are violent and ruthless, while women appear even crueler—with beaten faces ravaged by their own families, they nevertheless fight and protect their husbands with tooth and nail. The patriarchal honor code is key to their existence.
Though the events of the film are, at face value, horrifying, the power of Granik’s narrative comes from the fact that she never allows it to become melodramatic. Some scenes touch on the Gothic thriller, but there are so many moments in which “Winter’s Bone” could have assumed an entirely different tone. Opportunities for Lynchian rural creepiness or soap opera schmaltz abound, and yet the film remains utterly unsentimental, depicting moral codes without being moralizing. “Winter’s Bone” is as penetrating and harrowing as the frosty, sharp light that seeps through the Ozark forests themselves.

As the intrepid plastic heroes of Pixar’s “Toy Story 3” approach their new home—a much dreaded daycare center to which they are being donated, as their owner Andy departs for college—one of them cries out in surprised delight, “Look, it’s nice! See, the door has a rainbow on it!” Of course, only in a children’s film would colorful decorations on a door act as a plausible predictor for what lies behind it. Disney movies always make sure to helpfully dress up characters and locales in accordance with their essential nature. When the toys are welcomed with open arms by the local population and meet Strawberry-scented leader Lotso (short for “Lots-o-Huggin’ Bear”, voiced brilliantly by Ned Beatty), the initial perception of the cheerfully named Sunnyside Day Care Center seems to be confirmed. But the genius of “Toy Story 3” is that it straddles the line between childlike simplicity and mature reality such that audiences—like the toys—are constantly being misled by its jovial, happy veneer. As the day care center is unmasked as a fascist police state ruled by the ostensibly wholesome Lotso, “Toy Story 3” is unmasked as a film that uses the conventions of children’s cinema to ponder adult questions, where the answers and characters do not fall into easily distinguishable boxes.
The toys find themselves at the day care center because their owner has outgrown them. The fiercely loyal Woody (Tom Hanks) argues that the toys ought to stick by 17-year-old Andy and go into storage until he might have need of them. The rest of the toys are less than enthused by this proposition, and, feeling abandoned by Andy, pack themselves into a box that is being donated to day care, hoping to be played with once more. Beneath the cartoon exterior of this debate is a profound question: what is the nature of a committed relationship, and just how far do its obligations extend? At its heart, this is the question that the movie sets out to answer.
Along the way, “Toy Story 3” offers witty dialogue, creative plotting, an evocative score, and the sparkling animation viewers have come to expect from Pixar, and especially from writers John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich (the team behind the prior “Toy Story” films, as well as “Finding Nemo” and “Monsters Inc.”). There are deft nods to pop culture and, less congruously, to John Locke (whose mantra, “authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force,” is channeled by none other than Barbie, voiced by Jodi Benson). Beyond the specifics, “Toy Story 3” also showcases all the cinematic qualities which have made Pixar such a successful critical and commercial juggernaut for over a decade.
Most notably, though, it boasts an all star vocal cast: leads Woody and Buzz Lightyear are voiced by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, supported by Joan Cusack, Wallace Shawn and Michael Keaton, among others. Yet not a single billboard or trailer for “Toy Story 3” mentioned even one celebrity vocal actor. Animated features allow filmmakers to escape their actors’ previous work and avoid the persona and viewer expectations that a known actor normally brings to the table. Here, Tim Allen can play a hero, rather than a slapstick comedian, and Wallace M. Shawn ’65 can play a bashful dinosaur without anyone thinking about Vizzini and land wars in Asia. But overemphasize the actors—splashing their names on billboards or making their CGI counterparts match their facial expressions, as was done by Will Smith and Angelina Jolie in the Dreamworks misfire “Shark Tale”—and one risks bringing all that baggage back into play and hampering the freedom of the film to present truly original characters. Dispensing with physical presence—from star power to sex appeal—allows “Toy Story 3” to focus more on themes, and less on theatrics.
In this way, “Toy Story 3” is a grown-up’s film for kids. It doesn’t resort to winking at adults with double entendres or on-the-nose pop culture references like so many animated flicks, but instead engages them deeply in the subtext of the film, which, at its core, is about the bittersweet truth of growing up. Though kids will walk out of the theater excitedly repeating the movie’s jokes and plot points, their parents will have appreciated its deeper resonance.

Modern Piraeus, Athens’s port, is a grungy affair. Food shops sell days-old spinach pies, multitudes of tourists wheel suitcases over the grey grime of the sidewalks, and everything—the spanakopita and tourists alike—sweats from the heat. Painted metal grates separate the cabs and buses of the main roadway from the floating barges, giant hunks of metal lining the waterfront. An enormous ramp lowers onto each barge, and cars drive up the ramp so that in a few hours they can disembark elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Food is served on board these boats, and passengers often sit up top on the benches, looking passively at the sea gulls that swoop behind the boat.
This Piraeus is vastly different from the sea-faring launch pad that John R. Hale describes in his book “Lords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy.” The book is a work of history that makes the claim that the development of the Athenian navy is responsible for Athenian democracy. One might expect a book with such a hefty argument to be full of stale prose, but Hale’s work remains engaging by using people, rather than pure historical data, to drive the story.
Hale begins with Themistocles, a statesman of Ancient Athens, eating breakfast. Athenians had just discovered a deposit of silver, and a meeting in the morning would determine how the silver was to be spent. One idea was to dole the funds from the repository out to the citizenry in small units of currency. Themistocles, however, intended to convince the Assembly that instead the sum of the funds should be dedicated toward building up an Athenian navy to protect Athens against the Persians and the nearby inhabitants of Aegina. In convincing the Assembly, Themistocles creates the framework from which the rest of the story progresses.
Themistocles, with his “mêtis”—the fabled idea of cunning and wit that Robert Fagles immortalized in his translated epithet of Odysseus’ “wily ways” —is just one of the many characters Hale takes beyond historical fact and constructs into a personality. Pericles, Xerxes, Alcibiades, Alexander the Great, and Sophocles—whom we first see as a “handsome and talented youngster”—all play vibrant roles in the narrative.
Hale asserts quite boldly and fairly convincingly that if individuals such as Themistocles had not taken charge of the Assembly, a series of contingent actions would never have followed. Had Athens not constructed 100 new triremes—three-tiered ships with intense rams designed to splinter enemy ships—in order to defend themselves against the double threat of Persia and Aegina, not only would modern Piraeus not exist, but more significantly, modern notions of democracy would never have been formed.
Hale’s thesis is a little far-fetched. To maintain that ships are responsible for the gold standard of democracy’s success oversimplifies the evolution of democratic theory. But if taken with a grain of salt, the argument seems to have merit. He makes his case based on the inherent equality of rowing boats. “Oars were great levelers,” Hale writes, not least of all because each stroke had to be taken in exact unison by the hundreds of men sitting on rowing pads of uniform design. In order to have enough hands to pull the oars, 17,000 men in total according to Themistocles’ first estimation, the help of the thetes, a lowly Athenian class, would be necessary. In seating such men on the seats of the prized triremes, the thetes were raised to respectable ranks, earning blisters and calluses on behalf of Athens.
In 407 BC, the most incredible “leveling” took place. The Athenian Assembly voted to grant freedom and citizenship to slaves who enlisted in the navy. There, perhaps, lies the precedent for loyalist Lord Dunmore’s proclamation that all slaves who joined Her Majesty’s forces in the American Revolution would earn their freedom.
Though Hale maintains that ships were a democratizing force, he pays homage to those like Plato who had problems with the politics of a ship, unearthing an ancient debate. While earning a seat on a trireme represented social ascendancy for many oarsmen, it did not provide rowers with autonomy or influence. “One of Plato’s many complaints against the navy,” Hale says in his introduction, “was its reliance on the skill and technique of individual steersmen to win battles rather than the virtuous bravery of citizen soldiers fighting in the phalanx.” But it is the ship, not the phalanx that Hale describes as responsible for Athenian democracy.
This detailed analysis is bolstered by unexpectedly vivid descriptions, full of colorful imagery that help Hale avoid the dry, textbook-tone that seems to go hand in hand with books about ancient history. Battle scenes, of which there are many, depict ships with pyres extended like hedgehogs.  Moreover, naval terminology is used to apply to all aspects of Athenian life, including sex.
Though the ships in Piraeus are no longer subject to the debilitating effects of worms, and many other changes have taken place since the ancient period on which Hale writes, the sentiment behind the text is still relevant, and the argument still poignant. Whether or not modern democracy in fact owes its debt to Themistocles is somewhat dubious, but Hale’s idea of ships as a force that mobilized the Athenian citizenry makes for a compelling historical work.

Seeing as the hip hop department at Harvard’s WHRB radio station is called “The Darker Side,” it might seem that Christopher C. Hope’s decision to name his show “Hip Hope” was nothing more than a defiantly optimistic pun. The title is much more meaningful than simple wordplay, however, since Hope constantly strives to live up to the optimistic name.
Hope, a third year student at the Harvard Divinity School, uses his Saturday evening program on WHRB to showcase Christian hip hop, a genre he sees as a vital antidote to the messages delivered by mainstream hip-hop culture. “Music is one of the only phenomena that I’m aware of that not only stimulates your mental, but stimulates your spiritual and also your physical at the same time,” Hope says. “That’s a beautiful thing if it’s a music that’s empowering, that’s life-affirming. That’s a terrible thing when you’re talking about killing somebody.”
“Hip Hope” is just one of a series of endeavors that Hope uses to try to positively influence the Cambridge community. In addition to his studies and his radio show, Hope works with the Pentecostal Tabernacle Church in Central Square to help homeless people and the community at large. As part of his work at the church, Hope organizes a series of performances called the Kingdom Concerts. This summer, the concerts, which welcome local gospel acts, began offering medical treatment for attendees, many of whom would otherwise not have access to healthcare.
Dr. Mark C. Poznansky, an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School and the Director of the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, has worked with Hope for seven years, most recently helping to organize the medical aspects of the Kingdom Concerts. Poznansky praises Hope for his dedication to those he serves and for his charisma. “He’s such a wonderful speaker, and so heartfelt, it just emanates from him,” he says. Of the Kingdom Concerts, he says, “What I was most impressed by was the number of people who tuned up in Central Square to get healthcare, and that’s provided free plus music and spirituality and the rest of it. I was very impressed by the depth of what happened there.”
In fact, deep experiences seem to follow Hope. Since “Hip Hope” first appeared on the air in January 2009, it has evolved to include more time for discussion, during which Hope debates issues of faith and politics with his co-host, Michael J. DaSilva. Hope also encourages listeners to call in with their own testimonies and views—an invitation which many accept. DaSilva sees the show as a significant addition to the intellectual spectrum of the Harvard campus. “I think there’s a great interaction of ideas that takes place on college campuses, particularly at Harvard where you have some of the most brilliant minds in the world,” he says. “So I think our show is definitely well placed on the campus, and I think wherever someone may stand, it definitely challenges them to listen to a show like that, and maybe expands their mind and makes them think about something in a way they might not expect.”
As well as challenging the college community, Hope says he has learned from the diversity of people and opinions around him at Harvard. As he starts the final year of his degree, Hope says he would love to continue “Hip Hope” after graduate school, possibly expanding it to include hip hop from other faiths like Islam and Buddhism. Living in a pluralist community has already affected the show. Though Hope says the vast majority of callers offer only positive feedback, he has received some harsh words. “I’ve had some people say, ‘We don’t want to hear that garbage, that proselytizing.’ At the end of the day, people are going to have their opinions, and as long as the criticism is respectable, then I can listen and take note,” he says. Furthemore, Hope denies any interest in proselytizing. “The show is not about converting people,” he says. “What I do is I put the secular and I put the Christian hip hop [on air], and I let people decide.”

How much is cooking an art, and how much is it a science? While it contains an objective, scientific part that can be explained, there is also a subjective, artistic side to cooking that remains intuitive.
A new General Education course called Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter,” taught by professors Michael P. Brenner and David A. Weitz, will focus on the science behind cooking. It will help students discover, for example, what role butter plays in the making of cookies, or what the chemical differences are between baking soda and baking powder. When Harvard was introducing the General Education program, the administration encouraged faculty to invent new ideas that connect classrooms to the “life outside,” an approach which students tend to welcome.
Christopher J. Taylor ’12, who attended the first class, recognizes the benefit of learning something both academic and practical. “Cooking is a basic thing you have to know how to do. In this class you’ll be learning scientific properties to enhance your affinity to cook. The class looks fabulous,” he says.
When the course met for the first time last Thursday, students swarmed the Science Center, filling up every seat, all the space on the stairs and aisles, and even lining up in the back of the room. “I’ve never experienced so many people trying to get into a science class,” Brenner said during the class.
According to Brenner and students alike, the highlight of this course is that some of the world’s best-known molecular gastronomists like Ferran Adrià are coming to Harvard to lecture and even cook with students. For example, master chocolatier Enric Rovira will visit from Barcelona to demonstrate how he prepares his famous chocolates. “Making chocolates is an enormous art form,” Brenner said in class. “And yet tempering, the process of cooking chocolate, is the same physical process used to make steel,” he added.
The maximum amount of people this course can accommodate is 300, but some of the lectures the chefs give to the class will be open to the general public. The first lecture of the series is today and will feature renowned chefs Ferran Adrià and José Andrés.
Scientists are interested in exploring the chemical reactions that occur as different ingredients mix. While chefs acknowledge a scientific aspect to cooking, they also consider it mainly a creative and oftentimes spontaneous process. Steve “Nookie” A. Postal, the executive chef of the Boston Red Sox, mentions how cooking a good meal can be unpredictable: “Cooking is not only about following a recipe, or understanding how a recipe works. It all depends on the setting and if you’re having a good day.”
He adds, “I have noticed that if you’re in a good mood, and the weather is nice, everything you make will taste better to others.” Postal thus brings up a less linear, more artistic side to being a chef.
Jacky Robert, originally from Normandy, France, and chef of Le Petit Robert bistros in Boston, makes a similar point: “Chefs are chemists­—when you are experienced and have been cooking for 40 years like me, you always keep the reactions of food in mind. But cooking also has a certain mystery to it: most of us do it by feelings, and most of us cannot explain why we cook in a certain way.”
However, other chefs completely reject the scientific side of cooking. According to Antonio Castellano, co-owner of Italian restaurant Gran Gusto in Cambridge, cooking comes from the heart.
“Cooking is more than anything a passion as well as an art. You have to be inspired just like Pablo Picasso was inspired while painting. When you cook, you feel an emotion, and when others eat, they feel that emotion. Cooking is a creation that comes from love, a love of people as well as a love of food,” he says.
Just as it is possible to explain how minerals react to form paint, but harder to explain the process of painting itself, the feelings chefs put into cooking cannot be traced scientifically and yet they are essential to the way they prepare food. This course cannot and is not meant to explore cooking’s artistic aspects, but will help students gain practical knowledge by illuminating its scientific components. At the same time, the course and lecture series will open a new and interesting discussion on campus about the multi-faceted, somewhat technical and mysterious nature of cooking itself.

When a band from an independent record label tops the Billboard charts and sells out at Madison Square Garden within minutes, it’s worthwhile to examine how they did it. After releasing their first album on Merge in 2004, the colossal Canadian indie group Arcade Fire has quickly become a prime example of the recent popularization of indie music. On their third album, “The Suburbs”, the band continues their expansion into the mainstream, creating an album that evokes the mediocrity and banality of suburbia. The widespread success of this album comes from its ability to skillfully encapsulate the sentiments of ordinary life with music that is catchy and accessible. Yet in doing so, the music itself becomes somewhat suburban: safe and pleasing, but with a tendency to become monotonous and routine.
From the opening single, the title track, images of the commonplace are immediately elicited. The moderately-paced piano chords that open the song have a sense of contentment, until Win Butler’s ghostly voice and impassioned lyrics hint at the brewing angst underneath this manufactured cheeriness. The measured, neither-slow-nor-fast beat remains constant through the song. At first, the deliberate exchange between the bass drum and the snare evokes a pleasant stroll through the neighborhood, but gradually becomes a manifestation of tedium. As a result of such an accurate musical depiction of the suburbs, the song itself becomes a little too repetitive. The melody is simple and likeable, but never moving or memorable. Many of the songs on the album fall into a similar trap, suffering from a lack of intensity and spontaneity for the sake of embodying the life of the ordinary. Tracks such as “Modern Man” and “Ready to Start” are enjoyable and the lyrics evocative, but neither seem to progress much past the opening.
Several of the tracks do seem to open with an edge that the rest of the album seems to lack, yet these tracks soon become bogged down into mediocrity as well. “We Used to Wait” begins with driving, piercing piano chords that fit into the syncopation of the drums and guitar. The piano drives the song into a thumping bass drum build-up. Yet instead of exploding into the chorus, Butler fights the drive and keeps it controlled. Although the ploy may once again represent the stifled uneasiness of suburbia, musically it does little to keep the listener engaged. The song does build slightly more at the end, but not nearly enough to satisfy the listener’s craving for release.
It is truly a feat for a band from an independent label to achieve mainstream success while maintaining artistic integrity, and Arcade Fire should be commended for creating “The Suburbs,” an enjoyable and accessible album. However, in doing so, their music has become somewhat run-of-the-mill. “The ordinary man spends his life avoiding tense situations,” Bud said in the cult classic “Repo Man.” The suburbs leave no room for risks, and “The Suburbs” appeals to the ordinary by being just that.

The platinum success of Drake’s “Thank Me Later” is proof that self-deprecating, privileged, lovesick hipsters can find a home on the rap world’s hard streets. While Kanye West’s emotional unrest in the wake of personal tragedy incarnated itself on “808s and Heartbreak” and ended up cold, distant, and whiny—transforming West groupies into haters—Drake’s achievements in “Thank Me Later” what “808s” aspired to. Drake has barely an ounce of the swag possessed at near toxic levels by his musical compatriots, but his tortured thoughts on love, relationships, the downfalls of fame, and the difficulty of privilege make him endearing and relatable to the middle-class masses.
“Thank Me Later” is an uncluttered album fueled by spare beats, minor keys, moody synthesizers, and Drake’s hypnotically smooth voice. These traits are best displayed on “Show Me a Good Time,” which opens with syncopation that begs for sinuous movement in a smoky, dimly lit room at the end of a house party. Soon enough Drake begins his signature silky-smooth croon, begging for a good time that has glaringly obvious sexual undertones. But he quickly turns sentimental: “I live for the nights that I can’t remember / with the people that I won’t forget;” his first line of rap, reflects the youth, moodiness, and reflective attitude on fame that pervade the entire album.
“Don’t be fooled by the money / I’m still young and unlucky” notes Drake in “Karaoke,” a slow song with faint echoes of Michael Jackson’s “Human Nature.” Between those lines and the entirety of the ubiquitous summer hit “Find Your Love,” listeners can safely conclude that Drake has never had any luck finding real love. Most rappers sing about all the women they’ve bedded and the constant presence of voluptuoius and good-looking females in their lives, while Drake moans about the irony of how the girl he wanted to marry is now a wedding planner.  This is what sets Drake apart; he’s not afraid to show the chinks or even gaping holes in his armor against the world, and by letting listeners into his heart, where his true feelings lie, he becomes our hipster best friend.
The only downfall to the album is the number of high-profile guests that Drake enlists to help him on his way to fame. Drake sounds best on his own; tracks like “Over,” “Find Your Love,” “Thank Me Now,” and “Show Me a Good Time” are all so effective because they feature Drake rapping and singing about his experiences in his unique style that no one else is successfully emulating. When he is placed against heavy hitters like Jay-Z, T.I., Lil Wayne, and Young Jeezy, however, he is hopelessly shown up by the ease with which these members of rap royalty spit their flows. Drake is a new kid on the block; whenever he writes a rhyme he sounds like he tried too hard to write it (as in the overwrought lyric: “Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in”). T.I.’s southern drawl effortlessly coats “Fancy” like smooth molasses, while Jay-Z’s absentminded verse on “Light Up,” far from the best verse he’s ever performed, still brings attention to the fact that it’s better than anything Drake has come up with.
Despite its flaws, Drake’s “Thank Me Later” is a roaring success. There really aren’t enough popular, non-militant, emotionally confused rappers out there. Is there truly a market for this type of music, or will Drake end up as a one-album wonder? Drake can’t even tell you the answer; on the opening track “Fireworks” he notes that his “15 minutes of fame / started an hour ago.” However, while he is surprised by his success, he takes full advantage of his time in the spotlight. In the final track, “Thank Me Now,” he says: “I’m in the world where things are taken, never given / How long they choose to love you will never be your decision / And I’m aware that this could be the last time that you listen / So while I’m still here in this position / You can thank me now.”

This summer, as the media circus around Maya Arulpragasam, better known as M.I.A., intensified, the new album from this extraordinary, genre- and border-traversing pop artist was somewhat swept under the rug. M.I.A. is hardly the first pop star to incur criticism for an unconventional political position, but in May the backlash against her reached new heights when the New York Times Magazine ran a profile whose gratuitous cattiness was worthy of “Gossip Girl.” But as the ultimately trivial controversy around M.I.A. fades from memory, “Maya,” her third album, will finally attract the attention and repeated listens it deserves.
On its release in 2007, M.I.A.’s masterpiece “Kala” was initially regarded as dense and impenetrable by comparison to her frenetically catchy debut, 2005’s “Arular.” Yet “Maya” makes “Kala” sound like a hookfest. In a move that would seem bizarre coming from any other artist, M.I.A. saves the uptempo, electric songs of the kind that made her reputation for the four bonus tracks.  The initial twelve tracks, on the other hand, are leisurely, meandering and, in the album’s most notable stylistic departure from form, privilege M.I.A. the singer rather than M.I.A. the rapper.
M.I.A. herself would hardly claim technical dexterity, range, or accuracy for her singing voice. However, as it is the case with Bob Dylan and Stephen Malkmus, where she lacks in conventional gifts, she makes up for in skill and delivery, conscious of the best way to put forward her material. At 16 songs including the four bonus tracks, “Maya” is considerably longer than either of her previous albums. Perhaps stretched too thin, a few of the songs emerge as trifling or indulgent, and do not sustain the close reading and listening that is necessary to truly appreciate an M.I.A. record. The offending tracks are, most obviously, “Meds and Feds,” empty bluster of the sort one might expect from an M.I.A. imitator with none of her substance, and “It Iz What it Iz,” frankly disgraceful in its lazy banality.
Her experimentation with new style, however, pays off elsewhere in the album, results ranging from merely pleasant (“Space,” “Tell Me Why”) to enjoyable if slight (“XXXO,” “Lovalot”), to tracks that are more than worthy of her best work, such as the propulsive, irresistible cover of a Dutch obscurity, “It Takes a Muscle,” that ought to settle any doubts about her musical skill, and “Born Free,” the best piece of pure rap on the album.
This is all very well, but before the bonus tracks, the album is undeniably a significant disappointment from the artist who only three years ago gave us album-of-the-decade candidate “Kala.” “Maya” is elevated by these bonus tracks, which channel all the virtues of “Arular” and “Kala”—undeniable hooks and beats coupled with random noise and lyrics that pack meaning into short songs—without merely repeating a hackneyed formula. The finest thing on the album is the punk-techno-rap “Illygirl,” a track narrated by a 16-year old version of M.I.A., who namedrops “Billie Jean,” “Palestine,” “Mujahideen” and “Martin Luther King,” besides overwhelming the listener with its aural attack. “Maya” may not be another “Kala” or “Arular,” but it emerges as an intense and rewarding album in its own right.
In the long run, pop musicians are thankfully remembered in the first instance for their music—who today recalls that in the 1970s David Bowie and Eric Clapton were subjects of conterversy involving white supremacy? But even if “Maya” escapes references to her politics and personal life, it may forever be doomed to comparison to the rest of M.I.A.’s oeuvre. Even her most ardent admirers would be hard-pressed to deny that on the evidence, this is her worst album. But if this is her worst, surely that solidifies her standing as a contender for the title of world’s greatest pop artist.

Although “Yes Yes Yes” is Elsinore’s second album, they have offered such a major shift in style that this might as well be their debut. After five years out of the spotlight, their work deserves much recognition, and the band deserves a break-out run.
Elsinore’s first album, “Nothing For Design,” was comprised of soft, acoustic tunes and folk-country tones that added up to a decent, yet uneventful LP. That all changed though—dramatically—when work began on “Yes Yes Yes.” Whether band members were hit in the head with a rock and forgot what their last album sounded like, or they decided to start over and create a more mainstream, marketable sound, something clicked and it worked. Their new sound is extremely fresh and “Yes Yes Yes” deserves credit for combining strong musicality with a pop rock sound worthy of being put on repeat.
Even the album artwork of “Yes Yes Yes” says a lot about what’s in store. The cover is comprised of a colorful redo of a well-known Lichtenstein pop art piece, giving a vintage feel that is identifiable throughout the ten-track album. While, as stated above, Elsinore offers an indie pop sound that is very apropos to mainstream, popular artists, there is an old-school flair throughout the album that creates a more classic rock persona. An album that is best played straight through, “Yes Yes Yes” is worthy of a vinyl recording. Set it and let it play. Although it doesn’t have the entirely psychedelic feel of the 1970s epics, it comes pretty damn close.
A defining element of the album is its unpredictable, yet incredibly applealing tempo and style shifts throughout each song that add a unique flavor, forcing “Yes Yes Yes” into a genre of its own. “Gasoline,” one of the highlights of the album, begins with quiet vocals and a twinkling, digital background track, before it gains speed and jumps into verse and chorus, supported by acoustic guitars and an accented drum beat. The track is dominated by bassist Chris Eitel, whose bass line leads the way into a slow bridge that explodes into an epic guitar solo. We’re then brought back quickly to an amped up chorus, with loud and prominent lyrics that highlight the strength of Ryan Groff’s vocals.
Similarly, tracks such as “The General” and “Chemicals” offer fast-paced, catchy chorus-lines and guitar riffs which then unexpectedly shift into slow, jazzy portions, with ride cymbals and syncopated beats. Together, the back-and-forth between tempos adds a very dynamic and refreshing feel to tracks which otherwise might fall ill to the repetitive style that Elsinore’s last album suffered from.
Elsinore’s lyrics, or their absence, adds another interesting element to their music. Overall, “Yes Yes Yes” allots a relatively small amount of time to actual lyrical verses, with some songs such as “Body of Water” that are entirely instrumental. The album is dominated by experimentation with instrumentals, using lyrics only when they benefit the tone or musicality. And when they are used, they often make little sense, such as the ending of “Wooden Houses” which reads, “this is how hunger strikes begin.” As Groff sings in the song “Lines,” “words won’t be the weapon that I use on you.” That certainly is true.
“Yes Yes Yes” marks Elsinore as a band from whom we will be hearing a lot more in the future. By advancing their sound from their previous releases, the group sets this album apart not just from their past releases, but from the scenery of most other similar artists working today.

For a genre rooted in part in improvisational skills, mainstream rap is frequently guilty of a dearth of originality. Admittedly, this is a rather ephemeral quality, but it’s difficult to dispute that the same essential R&B instrumentals and gangland lyrical themes are too-often recycled by hip hop and rap’s leading lights.
Nobody expected the supposedly lesser half of hip-hop duo Outkast to lead the fight against monotony in major-label hip-hop, but with “Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty,” that’s exactly what Big Boi accomplishes. In both lyrical style and orchestration, Big Boi’s new album is an adrenaline shot into the heart of mainstream rap and hip hop. The rapper’s smooth and inimitable flow, over a wide and mercurial assortment of electro, funk and classical backdrops, is unmatched. And “Sir Luscious Left Foot,” is the genre’s most inventive effort since Madvillain’s “Madvillainy” in 2004, and most joyously eccentric since De La Soul’s “3 Feet High and Rising” more than 20 years ago.
The most impressive demonstration of Big Boi’s rhyming prowess is “Tangerine” a sparsely-produced tune in which ominous, sinusoidal bass and a crisp drumline take the backseat to the rapper’s vocal stylings. He spews lines like “Okay, midnight, fit like, four or five chicks / in the drop ‘66 bumpin ‘Southernplayalistic’ / as we ridin’ through the city lights, Monday Magic City night” at will, effortlessly shifting the cadence to accommodate his tongue-twisting rhyme schemes.
The album’s standouts vary in theme, instrumental support and mood, and at times the whole unit feels held together only by the single thread of Big Boi’s mesmerizing flow. Weaving rhymes within rhymes and switching tempos on a dime, he sounds more confident than ever on “Sir Luscious Left Foot,” and his lyricism turns out to be a far less tenuous unifier than might be expected.
“Shutterbugg,” the first single off “Sir Luscious Left Foot,” is perhaps not the best tune on the album, but does feature some of Big Boi’s silkiest rhymes. It also benefits from a spellbinding wordless vocal hook and a funky guitar-driven bridge. Still, the mostly straightforward track pales in comparison to some of its more adventurous neighbors.
One of those is “Shine Blockas,” a confection of synthesizer swells, delicate keyboards and carefully-constructed vocal layerings. Gucci Mane’s muddled, mediocre verse only reinforces how precise and listenable Big Boi’s rhymes are: “Can’t be tripping bout no paper cause the safe is not so safe / The piggy bank got legs and feet, and can’t get up and walk away,” he raps with his distinctive Georgian lilt.  This is the peak of “Sir Luscious Left Foot,” and the album experiences its only extended dip in quality in its remaining tracks.
But for all the standout tunes on “Sir Luscious Left Foot” perhaps its most remarkable quality is its consistency. Barring the irritating staccato chatter of “You Ain’t No DJ,” which breaks up an otherwise brilliant stretch in the album’s middle third, the album defies another rap cliché by containing near-zero duds, achieving the rare combination of innovation and evenness.
It’s a testament to Big Boi’s creativity and attention to detail that even the skits that end several of the songs – which on most rap albums constitute throwaway talk sessions or self-aggrandizing rants – are clever and genuinely funny. “Sir Luscious Left Foot” is a labor of love, and the work pays off in rhymes as reference-packed as a David Foster Wallace story and in the astonishing cohesiveness of an album that samples British R&B group Soul II Soul and a Tozzi opera in two consecutive tracks.  The long-gestating, oft-delayed “Sir Luscious Left Foot” displays the fruits of those extended efforts clearly, and seems destined as a result for an esteemed place in hip-hop history.

As foreshadowed by its sunny postcard-style album art and its breezy half-hour length, “Crazy For You” concerns itself primarily with creating a single, uniform atmosphere—a “Summer Mood,” as one of its song titles explicitly puts it—and it’s essentially a matter of preference whether you view that mood as one of whiny, apathetic, marijuana-infused banality or one of carefree, hazy longing. Either stance comes with plenty of proof, and that’s part of what has made Best Coast—and especially its public face and songwriter, Bethany Cosentino—so polarizing. Within the first minute of this record, you’ll probably know if you like it or not, and that says less about its depth (or lack thereof, potentially) than about the striking candor of its presentation.
After a handful of celebrated EPs and singles and a well-documented relationship with fellow Southern California-based lo-fi revivalist Nathan Williams (a.k.a. Wavves), Cosentino garnered considerable hype for Best Coast’s full-length debut and thus was destined to disappoint some. Each of Best Coast’s releases has wandered further and further from Cosentino’s previous band—drone/freak-folk/psychedelic outfit Pocahaunted (arguably a more emblematic example of her fondness for pun-y band names)—losing her some fans but winning her many more. She and multi-instrumentalist Bobb Bruno tone down some of the fuzz that defined their earlier singles; in its place are tighter songs with clearer, often higher vocals, and an overall less haunting afterglow.
That doesn’t make “Crazy For You” any less hypnotic, though, and the good songs on this album (there are many) have no difficulty lodging themselves deep in your brain and begging for repeat listens. Perhaps because the lyrics often conjure a feeling of intense stasis, the faster songs tend to be the most memorable and effective. The propulsive sway and swirling harmonies of “Boyfriend,” the jangle-pop rise and fall of the title track, and the twinkling kick and irresistible riff of “When The Sun Don’t Shine” give the album its energy and its charm. Cosentino is also a master of the change-up, turning songs like “I Want You” and “When I’m With You” from slow and steady, stripped down bedroom pleas into wild bursts of impassioned, gorgeous harmonies.
Like Jenny Lewis and Courtney Love, Cosentino has a voice powerful and versatile enough to carry what is essentially (and deliberately) an exceedingly simple record.
The typical “pathetic girl” tropes—waiting by the phone, wondering about other girls, being perennially relegated to “friend” status—are supplemented by her musings on more mundane topics, much to chagrin of many critics. While it’s true that statements like “nothing makes me happy / not even TV or a bunch of weed” present no great insight, there’s something refreshing and indeed almost stark about that brand of self-analysis. Aside from a certain present-day malaise, moments like these seem not so distant from a group like the Supremes declaring “no peace shall I find / until you come back and be mine.”
“Crazy For You” may not have the staying power of 2010’s other popular releases, and it probably doesn’t purport to. Ultimately there are only so many ways to rhyme “kiss you” with “miss you,” and perhaps Cosentino’s fans will grow tired of following her Twitter account—or at the very least, that of her beloved cat, Snacks, who graces the album’s cover. One wonders too at the curious omission from the album of any cover songs, which have often been the highlight of Best Coast’s EPs (particularly Cosentino’s sublime take on the Beach Boys’ “In My Room,” which she somehow manages to make both darker and more euphoric). But despite a few puzzling choices, Best Coast should be recognized and celebrated for staying true to its throwback aesthetic, and meanwhile crafting an album perfectly tailored to the summer—fleeting and with moments of tedium, but also warm, nostalgic, and beautiful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Frank Zappa once said, “Art is making something out of nothing and selling it.” To the outsider, it might appear that making something out of nothing poses the real challenge; selling the product should be easy. But to the traveling art student, quite the opposite seems true. The creating is easy; it’s the selling that’s hard.
Each year, Harvard offers an extensive list of grants of up to $5,000 to students with artistic inclinations. The list includes Artistic Development Fellowships, meant to “nurture the artistic development of promising and/or accomplished students in the arts;” the Isenberg Fellowship for traveling dramatists; and the Sydney Williams, Jr. Traveling Fund for the Visual Arts. These grants provide opportunities for aspiring artists to expand their horizons, develop their talents, and gain real world experience in their fields of interest.
Ironically, though, Harvard’s financial and institutional support this summer allowed traveling artists to realize that a successful career in the arts requires far more than a degree. Ultimately, these students learned that real-world artistic production is much more difficult outside of the Harvard Bubble. A few summer months in professional settings taught them an entirely new skill set, one that requires collaboration, proactive networking, and perhaps even more work than they receive at Harvard.
BEYOND THE GATES
Using her Artistic Development Fellowship, Sofia M. Selowsky ’12 spent her summer participating in the Salzburger Festspiele, an annual festival of music and theatre in Salzburg, Austria. The program, funded by Harvard and hosted by the University of Miami, opened her eyes to the demands of an opera singer’s lifestyle.
“In Austria and Germany, when you’re working as an opera singer, you get a contract,” says Selowsky. “You sing there for two years. You can be singing six hours a day. It’s pretty crazy but you get the benefits of a steady job.” Not all American performers can say the same.
In this way, the life of the opera singer is not too different from that of the young writer. Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11, an editor for the Crimson Arts Board, spent her Artistic Development Fellowship on a busy summer in New York City. She balanced internships at Gawker, the New Yorker, and the online movie magazine Premiere.com with screenwriting classes at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts.
“It was odd,” she says, “because the class met in the evenings and it was tough because I was in the city, interning full-time. [When] I took the screenwriting classes I took at Harvard, they were top priority, whereas this one, I would be tired from work, and I would get home, and I would be wearing horrible business casual pants, and then I would have to start writing. In a lot of ways it was a close approximation to working on assignment.”
Abigail F. Schoenberg ’12, a Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, funded her filmmaking trip to Uganda through the Williams Fund. One of her particular missions was to make a documentary for the Kasiisi Foundation, a non-profit run by Currier House Master Elizabeth A. Ross dedicated to improving women’s health and hygiene in third-world countries. During her project, Schoenberg found herself grappling with the classic paradox of artistic observation. “The biggest challenge that I had to face was that the kids there—whether I had the camera or not—would see me and just stop what they were doing. It was very hard to capture things on the camera because they would stop and just look at me.”
In a third-world country, these challenges were particularly pronounced. “Access in filming is always an issue,” she says. “Especially in the U.S., everybody is so paranoid, but access abroad is a totally different beast all together. People either don’t know what the camera is—they’re really curious—or a couple times I got, ‘Oh, this mzunga, this white girl, she’s just here to make money off of our pieces, we don’t want you to film us.’”
MEAT AND POTATOES
Above and beyond scheduling challenges and technical details, these itinerant artists had to make more conceptual adjustments. Chad R. Cannon ’11, a Music concentrator, spent his Artistic Development Fellowship on experiences in both Paris and Los Angeles. In Paris he developed the theoretical skills necessary for a career in musical composition. In contrast, his time in Los Angeles was spent honing far more practical skills.
In Paris, Cannon took part in a program run by the European American Music Alliance in memory of the twentieth century classical musical teacher Nadia Boulanger. The rigor of the program gave him a solid foundation for the more intangible aspects of his art. “So much of what composers nowadays are concerned with is style,” he says. “You know, ‘Who do you sound like?’ But in this program in Paris we boiled it down to ‘What is harmony? How do these notes function?’ It really gives you the meat and potatoes of composition and then you can take that back to style.”
In L.A., Cannon experienced first-hand the professional world of composition by working closely with Hollywood composer Chris Bacon. Bacon has composed for such films as Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” and M. Night Shyamalan’s “The Last Airbender.”
“The Paris program was very academic, very analytical,” he says, “but the Los Angeles experience was definitely on-site. This was how he was making his living. He was creating a product that he sells. It was very commercial—making music that you sell as opposed to an academic pursuit where you create art.”
The dichotomy between art and product was the linchpin of his experience. “Going into the film world, you know when you’re writing for film you’re going to have to give to a director’s will. You’re writing for a director, or the director’s writing through you,” says Cannon.
This creative process was far less personal for Cannon than the cerebral process he uses for composition classes within the Harvard sphere. “A lot of what you’re writing is for effect instead of for deeper art. It’s a lot more surface writing.”
Selowsky made similar observations. “Harvard’s music major is very academic,” she says. “It’s history of music, theory of music, analytical seminar music, it’s not based on performance.”While Fitzpatrick had taken creative writing classes at Harvard, her Tisch class taught her a different breed of creative writing: creating scripts for a multi-billion dollar entertainment industry.  “Classes at Harvard tend to focus more abstractly on artistic form,” says Fitzpatrick, “whereas in general this class was more industry focused, which was interesting.”
Fitzpatrick found herself learning a whole new way of approaching writing. “My teacher was very focused on story structure,” said Fitzpatrick, “As a writer I’m all about jokes and characters, but being forced... to make sure that that aspect of my script was good was really enlightening.”
THE ART OF THE NETWORK
As in any career, names matter in the art world. The connections these artists made turned out to be just as valuable as the skills they learned.
“The most important thing I achieved was the connections that I was able to make. Especially for film, that’s what you have to have, you have to have the skill set and the talent pool necessary, but this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to go and meet these people,” says Cannon. “It really helped to have Harvard’s name saying, ‘We support him in doing this project’ to make that direct connection. If I’m considering applying to grad schools, it was really important to go and meet people who were teaching at Julliard... It was helpful in a professional sense.”
Selowsky was fortunate to find herself in the company of professionals willing to share their own experiences with her. “Artistically in Austria, I got a ton of performance experience,” she says, “but I also met a lot of people who work in the opera houses around Europe and they gave me a sense of, ‘This is how hard you have to work, this is what you have to do to get from A to B.’”
The adults in their programs were not the only ones to know. “It helped to meet my peers in Paris,” says Cannon, “to know the personalities of other composers my age. You get some strange ones but obviously there are a lot of great, driven, talented people.”
“The other people in the program were really talented,” adds Selowsky, “and I feel like you learn a lot from the people you’re working with.”
PRODUCING THE ARTIST
After creating an informational video on proper washing in Rotooru, the regional Ugandan language, Schoenberg found her film could capture far bigger pictures.
“It actually opened up into a portrait of the region,” she says, “the interaction between the schools and the community, because the children in the schools are considered very privileged compared to others in the community.” The footage she gathered to explore this relationship will form the basis for work in her junior tutorial this year.
Cannon also is using his summer abroad to inform his academic work in the coming semester. “This year I’m going to be writing a senior thesis,” he says. “I’m excited to be able to blend my experiences into that.” The thesis, a piece based heavily on Japanese tradition, will draw significantly from his summer experiences.
Along with her raw footage, Shoenberg also brought back a sense of perspective from her travels abroad. “I feel like there are two ways to look at my experience,” she says. “You can look at it through my academic growth or my artistic growth, but when I think about having gone to Africa and having had this experience, I think about it in a personal way... I feel like my eyes have been opened to things that would seem obvious but I never really grasped.”
“It definitely gives you a greater appreciation of a different culture,” says Selowsky, who spoke no German before the summer began. “Austrian culture is completely different from America. They’re very conservative, they’re much quieter, so it was very interesting to be able to observe that and be able to appreciate it in contrast with American culture which is so loud and brusque.”
“As an artist, we’ll see, once I get editing and see the final product,” Schoenberg adds, “But as a person, as a global citizen, I think it was absolutely worth it.”­

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Is the Harvard man so marketable a commodity that women are willing to pay for the opportunity to meet one? The creators of the new dating website DateHarvardSq are counting on it. The website allows what it describes as “discerning women” to see five profiles of Harvard men each week after paying for a subscription. If the women happen to be drawn to any Harvard men in particular, they can then initiate personal contact. Harvard men are offered an even better deal: They pay nothing to sign up and can reply only to women who strike their interest. But while the dating website claims to offer a valuable service to the men and women it serves, DateHarvardSq degrades both groups via its reductionist premise.
DateHarvardSq promotes serious inequities between the sexes, with the most obvious degradation occurring at females’ expenses. First, women must pay a fee for membership while men can sign up for free, making the men precious commodities and women worth a dime a dozen. Second, the website touts Harvard men but not Harvard women. Although DateHarvardSq claims it is forming similar sites for discerning men and same sex couples, the fact that the men’s website was released first reinforces old beliefs that the Harvard name goes further for men than it does for women. More destructively, the website reinforces the idea that education and intelligence are more attractive qualities in a man than in a woman. Presumably, the creators of DateHarvardSq were not seeking to belittle the women they claim to be serving. Instead, their actions can be seen, in part, as a reflection on society as a whole: It was probably a natural instinct to release a website for Harvard men, and the creators likely saw little wrong with it. Still, the mere existence of the website does nothing to fight against the stereotype that a man’s education is worth more than a woman’s.
Perhaps less obvious is the way the website objectifies men. On DateHarvardSq, men are valued because of their affiliation with Harvard rather than for their unique qualities. Although there are many important traits that have nothing do with one’s university—such as one’s determination or passion for one’s partner—this site reinforces the idea that a name-brand university is a man’s most important trait.
In truth, many Harvard men will eventually find true love in countless different ways. The success of their relationships, however, stems from some connection beyond a Harvard degree and the appreciation of it. Both Harvard men and the women interested in them should know that they are worth more than DateHarvardSq indicates.

There was a time when television game shows involved thinking. Nothing could match the self-satisfaction of being able to “buzz in” the answer before a contestant or the simple pleasure of yelling random responses to a non-responsive television screen. But the days of interactive game shows are over, replaced by entertainment ploys with players racing to pull all of the tissues out of a box within a minute. TV game shows were once fun because they encouraged viewers at home to play along, but now they simply encourage viewers to sit on the sidelines and watch.
Growing up, “Jeopardy” was a favorite in my strict household since it enforced knowledge of random trivia, while educating us on the proper use of question words. Though new game shows, like “Minute to Win It,” do teach us necessary survival skills for relinquishing boredom, they do not help with other aspects of life, like school or jobs. Once, while watching a Jeopardy episode with a physics category, I refreshed my memory on important concepts I learned earlier in class. It was fun to race with the players to find the right answer. My experience with “Minute to Win It” was nowhere as worthwhile: I watched a woman try to find a ball and put it in a basket with a blindfold over her eyes. It was frustrating; how can one possibly empathize with that challenge? Game shows should test the limits of proficiency at some useful skill, but today networks use the format as a gateway for ridiculous entertainment.
This downslide is perhaps due to the corrosive influence of reality TV. I used to enjoy game shows since they were the few remaining programs that did not make me feel guilty about watching television; I had to think and strategize as well as watch. But reality TV has influenced game shows to turn into a form of entertainment as passive as almost any other TV program. Now, we are expected to gain our self-satisfaction not from struggling with the contestants and eventually “beating” them by answering faster but by laughing at them as they humiliate themselves in their scramble through a flashy obstacle course, filled with random punching fists, and impossible, huge red balls.
At least in older reality-TV game shows like “Survivor” and “Big Brother,” there was something to be won by the contestants, since people had to strategize and even manipulate to gain that final money prize. But, in newer shows, this trope has been removed: contestants can only win by embarrassing themselves. These game show-incarnations have taken the thrill of healthy competition out of the genre and have become practically mindless game play. Rather than stimulating mental proficiency, TV “game shows” now check any form of thinking from the viewers and even the contestants.
While networks should be awarded for attempting to provide light-hearted fun during an era believed to be nearly as bad as the Great Depression, they should not be rewarded for promoting an idle mentality for viewers or a lack of quality programming. I liked TV game shows. I liked pretending I was a part of the game. I liked believing that television would not rot my brain as much as my parents said it would. But this one beacon of hope has become spoiled by the networks’ and American viewers’ desire for flashy, easy entertainment.

It has been a bad summer for Pakistan. First, repeated terror attacks hit the country. One of the worst hit areas was the Data Darbar shrine, a center for the large Sufi following of an important saint and proponent of a peace-loving Islamic tradition. Second, a passenger plane crashed into Margalla hills in Islamabad killing everyone on board. And finally, the tragic flooding has affected over 18 million people, amongst whom 10 million are in dire need of immediate assistance. Over 130,000 square kilometers of land have been affected by the destruction of 1.2 million homes. This includes the destruction of 30 percent of farmland belonging to a largely agricultural based economy and the support system of millions of farmers. Not the ideal summer for the average Pakistani.
“The magnitude of the problem; the world has never seen such a disaster. It is beyond anybody’s imagination,” said U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki Moon. Indeed, the flooding in Pakistan has opened a Pandora’s box of humanitarian concerns. According to the United Nations, only 64 percent of the funds needed to meet the $ 458 million cost of the crisis have been found despite this being the single largest disaster of this century. According to a BBC report, by early August: “the international community had actually committed funding that works out at just over $3 per flood-affected person. The commitment per person after the 2005 Pakistan earthquake was $70 and for this year’s Haiti earthquake it was $495.” Donors have been slow in responding to this situation, although many reports by BBC correspondents tell heart-wrenching stories of displaced flood victims who are still lining the roads to the major cities, waiting for relief trucks to arrive.
So why all this apathy? A BBC report attributes it to donor fatigue from the tsunami, Haitian earthquake, and the effects of the economic crisis. Another factor is the role of corruption in the Pakistani government and private non-governmental organizations. In truth, Pakistan has been among the top recipients of US-AID since the Soviet war in Afghanistan and we have little to show for it. In a nation riddled with inefficient and corrupt policy makers, an affluent and listless upper class, an army that likes to step in at opportune moments, and a hotbed of extremist elements, Pakistan should have taken responsibility for its problems. The international community could only do so much.
But the floods have shifted this responsibility. Recent comments by British Prime Minister David Cameron labeling Pakistan as a country that promotes terror did not help donations. The people of Pakistan cannot be made to suffer any longer as a result of political concerns and international apprehensions about the government’s alleged links to terror groups. The government cannot reconstruct or provide relief so the civil society has taken it upon itself to do this. Many reliable organizations in Pakistan that have been effective for years now deserve the support of the international community. The resilience of the common man and heroic stories of rescue and support by the Pakistani citizen have only been touched upon by the media. The Edhi Foundation, run by Abdul Sattar Edhi, a recipient of numerous international and local awards, had the largest voluntary ambulance organization in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records 2000. This organization, along with numerous others like the Rural Support Program Network and The Citizen’s Foundation, has been functioning as the most effective charities since the floods struck. The dubiousness of many of Pakistan’s charities cannot be disputed, but the responsible and effective ones must and should be supported by the international community.
As students in a prestigious university, we can ask ourselves why a country so strategically important in the battle against extremist elements is being allowed to fall victim to this humanitarian disaster. Furthermore, those same elements are capitalizing on the opportunity to spread terror and garner support inside and outside its borders. The recent triple bombing of a Shi’ite procession in Lahore, followed by another on a similar procession in Quetta, in the midst of this unprecedented disaster is a blow not just to a minority Islamic sect in the country, but also to the system, which is struggling to pull itself together in the wake of this disaster. According to an August report in Reuters, Jamat ud Dawa, a charity with alleged links to the banned Lashkar e Taiba (responsible for the Mumbai attacks of 2008) was the first to arrive with supplies for flood victims in villages of Punjab. They had already established a reputation “as a tireless relief group” in the 2005 earthquake after aiding thousands of survivors.
How the rest of us deal with the floods is a make or break situation. This is an opportunity to rebuild in bigger and better ways, and also an opportunity to lay waste everything the world has struggled for since 9/11. As individuals we can contribute to the right places in our own small ways. The people of Pakistan have had a bad summer. This could turn into a bad year, a bad decade, and, altogether, a bad future. Finally, it is incumbent upon us to ask ourselves: what can we do?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a former embryo with ambiguous moral status in the United States, I welcomed the recent halting of research involving embryonic stem cells.  But the key to understanding why my own response was not shared by President Obama is to realize that embryonic stem cell research is inseparably bound to a larger societal confusion about what to do with human organisms before birth.
When the president spoke in support of embryonic stem cell research on Mar. 9, 2009, he was very explicit that other uses of embryos were off limits.  “And we will ensure that our government never opens the door to the use of cloning for human reproduction.  It is dangerous, profoundly wrong, and has no place in our society,” he said.  The president’s comments defending embryonic stem cell research but condemning cloning are an illogical but effective doorstop.  Specifically, the president keeps the door to research ajar by claiming that the destruction of human embryos for science is defensible, but the manufacture of the same exact life forms for cloning is not.  President Obama’s executive order permitting the use of mostly discarded embryos provides some political cover, but already in New York, for example, stem cells can come from any source, including live embryos not yet discarded.
It’s important to realize that using the embryo as a guinea pig as Obama supports here is a subset of the characterization of embryo as problem.  Under this portrayal, the destruction of a fetus on an elective basis, that is, for reasons other than the threat of death to its mother, is permitted under a viability-centered rationale.  But as surgeon and author Atul Gawande points out, viability is the wrong issue on which to focus, since modern medicine’s ability to preserve the life of a fetus is irrelevant to the human fetus’ personhood.  As a thought experiment, the use of perfect artificial wombs for gestation allowing fetuses to survive outside the womb at any point shows that viability and personhood are distinct issues.  Here’s another thought experiment that’s less theoretical: If viability was the organizing principle in Roe v. Wade, consider that a pre-2003 United States permitted post-viable fetuses to be killed mostly on an elective basis apart from health concerns.
President Obama, perpetuating the current approach that refuses to address whether human beings are persons before birth, really has no objection to cloning outside of strongly moralistic but unfounded protestations.  Cloning would produce human organisms with no claim to personhood, at least for a while.  This would only leave the state with more non-persons on which to regulate experimentation.  Just to clarify, this isn’t an argument that depends upon vagueness, or how many planks compose Theseus’ ship, in an attempt to split hairs over when personhood would be acquired rather than inhered.  Instead, the claim here is that the rationale allowing for embryo destruction in stem cell research, via its willful ignoring of this debate of personhood, permits agents to do whatever they want with human organisms before viabilityPolicymakers’ inability to realize that the question “Will it survive?” is not at all the same as “Is it a person?”, and refusal to engage this last question creates the inconsistencies seen in abortion law today.
The President’s remarks demonstrate no consistency in moving from cloning to research on pre-fetal humans because our legal framework has none.  The Court “need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins”, as Roe v. Wade puts it, and in the meantime, it’s made the prudent choice to assume that an answer of “maybe” is license for experimentation and removal of these perhaps-persons.  As ethicist Jacob Appel explains, even the exploitation of fetuses for organ harvesting is a logical corollary of current rationales.  If a mother has a claim against a fetus’ infringement of her liberty sufficient for destruction, there’s no reason why economic profit should be precluded from this exercise of her liberty.  Appel argues that a robust market could develop around the production of fetuses solely for their organs, blood, and whatever else carries an “economic incentive.”
Obama’s attempt to make cloning immoral but embryonic destruction acceptable is not convincing to those like Appel, myself, or anyone on either side of the abortion debate seeking consistency.  The philosophical premises on which artificially producing an item of indeterminate or no moral value leads to a “profound wrongness” would be interesting.  But, neither you nor I will ever get to see these arguments, even under this reputedly intellectual president. The cost of this refusal to address when a human organism no longer qualifies as an appropriate subject for exploitative research is any sort of logical consistency at all.
Put another way, the “profound wrongness” that the president sees in cloning has to come from somewhere, and it has to be grounded in some normative source.  But the president never tells us what that is. The logic permitting the creation and abortion of a human embryo for research also allows cloning for any purpose whatsoever, so long as the resultant fetus is not killed after its emergence from the womb. But even here, Obama’s refusal to endorse “born alive” legislation makes this last point a shade of gray, since he permits a type of infanticide, insofar as allowing fetal protections would challenge Roe v. Wade by giving infants protection during the birthing process.
By centering on viability, current abortion law obscures the issue of personhood.  President Obama, by opposing cloning yet supporting destruction of embryos in and outside the lab, invites the American public to deepen their inconsistency in the pre-birth ethical arena.

A new oak is growing in Harvard Yard, but not a tree—“Oak Yard” has joined Crimson, Elm, and Ivy Yards as the fourth freshman residential neighborhood.
Resident Dean Jonas V. Clark will head the new yard, which comprises Canaday and Thayer dormitories, previously parts of Elm Yard and Ivy Yard.
The change has shrunk each yard in student size, reducing each dean’s workload.
“We felt that with four deans we could give even more personal attention to the students, and the workloads of the deans would be more manageable,” said Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67.
Some freshmen living in Oak Yard said they had seen Clark at the freshman welcome event but didn’t actually speak with him.
“I haven’t talked to him. I tried, but he seemed kind of busy,” Thayer resident Peter Wang ’14 said of Clark.
Dingman said the typical workload of a freshman resident dean has increased in recent years as the student body has become more diverse and freshman programming has been scaled up.
“Now it’s a much more exciting place, a much more vibrant place, but we have to pay attention to the individual experiences of students and not assume that everybody is getting on board without stretching in uncomfortable ways,” Dingman said.
Some students said that they didn’t affiliate strongly with their freshman yard assignment, a sentiment also echoed by Dingman, who called the division into yards an “administrative convenience.”
But some freshman do feel some pride for their yard assignments.
“I get excited when I meet another person from Oak Yard,” Carol Tran ’14 said. “It’s just another thing we have in common.”
A native of Northfield, Mass., Clark graduated from Haverford College in 2004, concentrating in political philosophy and captaining the baseball team.
He received a master’s degree from the Harvard Divinity School in 2008 and worked as a freshman proctor.
Clark joins three other resident deans of freshmen: Sue Brown of Elm Yard, William Cooper ’94 of Ivy Yard, and Catherine R. Shapiro of Crimson Yard.
The post of resident dean of freshmen is virtually identical to that of the Allston Burr resident dean in the upperclassman Houses.
Resident deans of freshmen are charged with overseeing freshmen’s academic well-being and, like their counterparts in the Houses, sit on the Administrative Board, the College’s primary disciplinary body.

As the primary election for the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex State Senate seat approaches, three-month incumbent Sal N. DiDomenico has garnered a slightly weightier list of endorsements from labor unions and local politicos than has challenger Timothy R. Flaherty.
Cambridge officials, however, are split between the two Democrats—Flaherty, a homegrown lawyer, and DiDomenico, an Everett resident with Cambridge roots.
On Friday, Flaherty announced that the Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 453—which represents over 300 employees of  the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority—has endorsed his  candidacy.
Flaherty has also been endorsed by several law enforcement unions, including the International Brotherhood of Police Officers and the Masschusetts Police Association.
DiDomenico, the incumbent Senator who won the seat in a special election last May, boasts endorsements from organizations including the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, Massachusetts branch of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Sierra Club. Two Senators and one Congressman who represent Massachusetts in Washington, D.C., along with State Senate President Therese Murray, have proclaimed support for DiDomenico.
Meanwhile, Flaherty’s spokeswoman Dorie R. Clark mentioned the endorsement of Jarrett T. Barrios ’90, who held the same seat from 2003 to 2007, as “one of the major turning points in the campaign.”
Among Cambridge’s City Councillors, four have endorsed DiDomenico—a former Everett Councillor—and three support the candidacy of Cambridge resident Flaherty.
“I think he’s shown a great deal of energy and focus about the issues here in Cambridge, and that has impressed me,” said Cambridge City Councillor Sam Seidel of Flaherty.
He added that Cambridge may be better served by a representative who is a denizen of the city.
“I think your sense of what happens in the world really starts at home and then it goes out from there,” Seidel said. “It’s important to me that our representative on Beacon Hill really puts Cambridge right up there.”
Chris J. Keohan, DiDomenico’s campaign manager, said that his candidate spent the first 30 years of his life in Cambridge, a fact that he plans to emphasize in mailings to Cambridge residents in the week before the election. Keohan said that while DiDomenico currently resides in Everett, the endorsements he has received from Cambridge political figures demonstrate “the progressive values that he shares with the city that basically shaped who he is.”
Cambridge School Committee member Marc C. McGovern said that he endorsed DiDomenico because of the candidate’s advocacy of early childhood education, job training, and the establishment of a BLGT commission during his brief tenure in office so far.
“When the person is doing a good job, you don’t switch them out,” McGovern opined. “In three months, he has been able to get things done.”
The Senate seat was vacated in January by Anthony D. Galluccio upon his imprisonment for a probation violation. Six Democrats ran for the seat in a special primary held last April; DiDomenico was the winner, closely followed by Flaherty.
The seat is up for grabs again this fall, following the regular election schedule, and only Flaherty has challenged DiDomenico in the Democratic primary. Barbara T. Bush is the only Republican candidate for the seat.

CORRECTION: September 7, 2010
An earlier version of the Sept. 7 news article "Dems DiDomenico and Flaherty Compete for Endorsements" stated that  there is no Republican candidate for the Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex State Senate seat. In fact, Barbara T. Bush is the Republican candidate.

Harvard Psychology Professor Marc D. Hauser will not be advising any undergraduate theses or be the primary adviser for any graduate student while on leave, according to psychology department chair Susan E. Carey ’64, forcing several students to rearrange their academic plans for this year.
The two undergraduates planning on writing theses under Hauser have found new advisers, who will work with graduate students familiar with their work in Hauser’s lab, Carey wrote in an e-mail.
Carey said the two graduate students whom Hauser advised have also been working with the psychology department to find solutions: One plans to finish her PhD under her new adviser, and the department is helping the other find “the best committee of advisers.”
“This is an ongoing process, with this student and indeed with every student in our department—making sure that they are seeking out the advice of anybody they could be working with to further their own independent research program,” Carey wrote. “Obviously, in this case there are also unique considerations they must take into account in deciding whether they want Hauser as their primary adviser.”
Carey said the department is also working to ensure that job prospects for students who have worked in Hauser’s lab will not be affected by the investigation’s conclusions. Carey did not elaborate on what measures the department will be taking.
News of Hauser’s one-year leave following a three-year Harvard investigation that found him responsible for eight instances of scientific misconduct took undergraduates considering writing a thesis with him by surprise.
“I was really only toying with my idea for a thesis when I saw the first New York Times story, but it was shocking nonetheless,” wrote Maya E. Shwayder ’10-’11, a psychology concentrator and a Crimson editorial writer who worked in Hauser’s lab last year, in an e-mail.
Shwayder added she felt the investigation’s conclusions most affected the graduate students working with Hauser.
“Even with my personal plans getting derailed, that’s nothing compared to the months or years of work they’ve done suddenly being called into question,” Shwayder wrote.
One of Hauser’s former post doctoral students said he thinks that Hauser’s graduate students seeking academic positions may have difficulty finding jobs, even though he believes Hauser’s “scientific misconduct” may be the result of “somewhat sloppy” errors as opposed to intentional fabrication.
“Given that few seem to make the distinction between rumors, allegations and facts, it is possible that the rumors associated with Hauser will be associated with Hauser’s students as well,” the post doctoral student wrote in an e-mail, noting that this might be a problem for these students’ employment opportunities.
But Gerry Altmann, the editor-in-chief of Cognition, a scientific journal which recently retracted an article Hauser published in 2002, was more optimistic about employment opportunities for Hauser’s graduate students.
Those who tried to replicate Hauser’s work and failed may have fewer articles on their curriculum vitae, Altmann wrote in an e-mail, but he added “there is much sympathy for people who got caught up in all this.”
“I do not believe anyone who has worked with Hauser will be discriminated against,” wrote Altmann, who recently posted on his blog that he believes a significant portion of data presented in the Cognition article was intentionally fabricated.
None of the undergraduate or graduate students who have worked in Hauser’s lab agreed to be interviewed for this article, except for Shwayder and the post doctoral student.
All who declined interview requests cited the sensitive nature of the investigation, as Hauser is facing federal inquiry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After two unsuccessful searches to replace Harvard’s two endowed professorships in Latin American history, the history department will, for the second consecutive year, rely on visiting faculty to fill the two positions.
While the history department awaits clearance from the University to launch another search in the spring, undergraduates hoping to write Latin American history theses and graduate students in the field continue to find creative ways to pursue their course of study.
“No one feels worse about the absence of Latin American history professors than the history department,” said James T. Kloppenberg, the department’s chair. “We went from having three titans in the field to having nobody.”
Until a few years ago, three eminent professors defined Harvard’s Latin American history program. John H. Coatsworth left Harvard for Columbia in 2008, and John Womack Jr. ’59 and Kenneth R. Maxwell—experts on Mexican and Brazilian history, respectively—both retired in 2007.
The department began its search for replacement faculty as soon as Womack and Maxwell decided to retire and has offered appointments to two applicants, Kloppenberg said.
Both chose to remain in their current academic positions due to reasons involving a spouse and a partner.
Over the past few years, visiting professors have been teaching the department’s Latin American history course offerings.
Peer institutions, including Yale, Princeton, Brown, and Stanford, all have between one to three full professors of Latin American history.
Some faculty and students expressed concerns that the failure to fill these vacancies suggests a lower priority for Latin American history than other more traditional fields of study, such as American and European history, at Harvard.
Maxwell said he could not imagine the University allowing a similar lapse in filling tenured positions in the more traditional historical fields.
“It’s really incredible to have let that [strong Latin American] tradition die,” he said. “It’s an amazing gap, and it needs to be filled speedily, I think.”
Maxwell added the hiring delay also affects the graduate student admissions in Latin American history. To his knowledge, he said Harvard’s history department has not accepted one graduate student studying Latin American history since he and his colleagues left.
“We haven’t admitted any [graduate] students because we don’t have any senior faculty in place in Latin America,” Kloppenberg said. “We wouldn’t think of admitting a student without the proper faculty. Students continue to apply, but we just can’t take them.”
For undergraduate history concentrators, studying Latin American history is a matter of being persistent and creative, according to Marcelo Cerullo ’10, whose Hoopes Prize-winning thesis tracked the development of the Brazilian coffee industry in the late 19th century.
Over the course of his career, Cerullo said he took courses related to Latin America in other departments—such as Professor Steven R. Levitsky’s popular class on Latin American comparative politics—as well as the occasional history offering with a visiting professor.
“I don’t think you’re fighting a much steeper uphill battle than anyone else—motivated students will find interesting courses to take,” he added. “Maybe because I was forced to be creative in coming up with courses to take, I learned a lot of other things I wouldn’t have otherwise considered. I don’t feel that I received a lesser education, or a more incomplete education.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Google filed an agreement on Friday to pay an $8.5 million settlement to end a class action lawsuit over privacy issues raised by Google Buzz that was initiated by a Harvard Law School student last February.
The money will be dispensed into a “common fund” and will eventually be distributed to non-profit groups that advocate for internet privacy.
The lawsuit alleged that Google Buzz—Google’s social networking application—breaches users’ privacy by disclosing personal information without consent.
Seven privacy-related lawsuits were originally filed against Google Buzz, but they were eventually merged into the class action lawsuit filed by the Harvard student Eva S. Hibnick and led by attorney Gary E. Mason. Mediation with Google began in June.
The process for divvying up settlement funds among non-profits is not well defined at this point, according to Mason. Though Mason will legally manage the common fund, members of the class action suit will be involved in generating a list of potential recipients, which must also be approved by Google before being presented to a judge for final review.
Though Mason would not disclose the exact amount sought by the plaintiffs, a similar privacy case against Facebook in which the company paid a $9.5 million settlement served as a benchmark in the negotiations with Google, he said.
One of the plaintiffs’ chief complaints was that Google Buzz operated as an “opt-out” program that Gmail users are automatically signed up for until they choose to deactivate the program.
“They [Google] say that they made a mistake in how they launched Buzz. And I think they will be careful in the future not to disclose personal information inappropriately,” Mason said.
Though Google has made significant privacy changes since the lawsuit was filed last year, Buzz continues to be an opt-out program.
“Google denies [opt-out] was a privacy breach. There isn’t a legal resolution to that,” Mason said.
“But it’s fair to say it was a strong enough of a claim that they were willing to settle it.”
In a blog post published the day the settlement was filed—but not directly referencing the lawsuit—Google’s Associate General Counsel Mike Yang wrote that the company wanted to make its privacy policies “more transparent and understandable.”
A judge is scheduled to preliminarily approve the settlement on Dec. 20, after which interested parties—including Gmail users—have an opportunity to object to the settlement terms before the judge issues a final approval approximately two months later, at which point funds can be disbursed.
The class action lawsuit was first suggested by then third year Law School student Benjamin R. Osborn and was originally filed by Eva S. Hibnick, then a second year Law School student, on behalf of all Gmail users. Hibnick has since withdrawn her name from the lawsuit for personal reasons, according to Mason.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
He may not yet be Landon Donovan, but Brian Rogers certainly had a flair for the dramatic Saturday night.
In a goal reminiscent of the USA soccer star’s own against Algeria, the Harvard sophomore scored the go-ahead tally in the 80th minute to send the No. 10 Crimson men’s soccer team to a thrilling 2-1 victory against No. 13 Stanford.
After getting past two Cardinal defenders and kicking the ball past sliding Stanford goalie Jason Dodson, Rogers pulled his shirt over his head, then ran to the nearest corner arc to celebrate with his teammates—much like Donovan did after his game-winner.
It was a fitting climax to a game that had a World Cup-like atmosphere throughout, with over 3,000 fans packing into the brand-new Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium and making persistent noise.
“I think tonight we captured a small piece of the excitement of big time college soccer in this country,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said.
“We couldn’t stop talking about it,” added senior defenseman Robert Millock. “We really fed off [the fans’] energy. It was pretty special.”
A FRESH START
Before the season began, Coach Junot said he was unsure of how much playing time the seven members of his freshman class would get, indicating that a few of them may be able to contribute immediately while others would have to work their way into his rotation.
Yet on Saturday night, not only did Junot’s freshman play, they played a lot.
Five of seven members of the class of 2014 saw major action against Stanford, led by midfielder Kevin Harrington, who played a full 90 minutes.
Defender Ross Friedman, midfielders Obiajulu Agha and Kyle Henderson, and forward Connor McCarthy each also saw at least 33 minutes of action in their first collegiate games.
“It was a little intimidating,” Friedman said. “I wasn’t sure how I would match up to the speed of play, to the physicality. I think I immediately adjusted and did everything to help my team as much as I could.”
The five players weren’t the only first-timers out on the field for the Crimson. It was also Junot’s first game as a collegiate head coach.
DEFENSE WINS CHAMPIONSHIPS
While much talk coming into the 2010 season surrounded the departure of a good deal of the team’s 2009 offensive firepower–Andre Akpan ’10, Adam Rousmanierre ’10, and Desmond Mitchell ’10 accounted for half the team’s scoring last year–no one was too concerned about the stability the team would have on the defensive end of the field.
That confidence proved warranted Saturday. With co-captains Jaren LaGreca and Millock–both of whom played the full 90 minutes–leading the way, the Harvard defense proved tough to break Saturday night.
“I thought we were pretty solid,” Millock said. “We’ve been working a lot defensively this preseason just on being organized.”
Stanford was only able to manage five shots on goal against Harvard goalie Austin Harms, while the Crimson, in contrast, got off nine attempts on Cardinal goalkeeper Jason Dodson.
“I thought if we could keep pressure high throughout the second half we could create the opportunities we wanted and give ourselves the chance to win the game,” Junot said. “I never foresaw Stanford getting to the point where they would really put it on us and go ahead in the second half.”
LaGreca’s veteran savvy was exemplified most towards the end of the contest, as Stanford threatened to tie things up with under thirty seconds on the clock. After Harms was caught out of place, leaving half the net exposed, LaGreca stepped in to use his body and deflect a Stanford shot attempt away from the net, preventing disaster.
REES’ PIECES
In 2009, midfielder Jamie Rees, then a sophomore, attempted nine shots.
It was therefore somewhat surprising when Saturday’s box score showed that Rees had taken only one less shot in one game than he had over all of last season.
Rees’ eight shots led the game by a wide margin, and his two shots on goal also tied for a game high.
“Jamie brings a ton of energy,” Millock said. “He’s entered into a much larger role this year than he had last year, and he’s embraced it...I think he did really well.”

Revitalized from a half time pep talk, the Harvard women’s field hockey team scored five goals while shutting out Holy Cross (0-1) in the second half to clinch a 6-1 victory at Jordan Field on Saturday. The Crimson (1-0) claimed its first win of the season led by the strong performance of sophomore Emma Keller, who had two goals in the second half.
“Winning our season opener was a huge success for our team,” Keller said. “We have more numbers this year than last, with eight new freshmen greatly contributing, and [we] worked extremely hard this preseason to really refine our core skills and speed up the play of the game.”
Harvard got off to a fast start and scored in the fourth minute on a penalty corner. Freshman Carly McNeill took the deflection from senior teammate Chloe Keating’s shot and put the ball into the back of the Crusaders’ net.
But Holy Cross equalized in the 13th minute as a scramble in front of the Crimson goal post resulted in a Crusaders score.
With the game tied at 1-1, both teams settled down defensively, pressuring the pass and making momentum-stopping interceptions.
Harvard got several opportunities through its combination of tough defense and great ball movement, but the team could not capitalize. Each time the shot would fall just wide or the last pass would be just out of reach. But the team held on through those frustrating moments and with time winding down in the first half, junior co-captain Carly Dixon took a pass on the run and rifled a shot past the Holy Cross goalkeeper.
Yet upon further review, time had expired before the shot, and Dixon’s score was discounted. Nevertheless, Dixon’s shot ignited the team and the Crimson held the momentum going into halftime.
“We talk about the first five and last [five],” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “Time ran out, and it was too bad. I think [the players] could hear us counting, and they just kept on fighting.”
Coming out of the break, Harvard drew on its first half momentum and pushed the tempo of the game through swift passing, taking Holy Cross by surprise. The Crimson dominated possessions and took four shots at the goal in the span of 10 minutes before Keating finally came through with a long-range shot in the 45th minute.
“We had great execution from our attack corners,” Caples said. “We had outstanding passing combinations and really nice passing patterns. We changed from a four to a three working the ball out, and we had good overlap. We had numbers around the ball and numbers above the ball. “
Indeed, the great passing gave Keller all the opportunities she needed to break the game open. The rookie scored two goals in the span of three minutes, putting Holy Cross well out of contention. Both Sophomore Katelin Wahl and Junior Georgia McGillivray had a goal in the second half as well, with McGillivray’s score coming off a penalty corner.
But Harvard’s defense was just as important as its offense. The Crimson swarmed the ball each time the Crusaders moved into the home half of the field, and the backs continued to anticipate passes and intercept balls going towards the goal. Sophomore Nina Kucharczyk led the fast break multiple times with passes stolen from the opponents. The tough defense limited Holy Cross’s opportunities and allowed Harvard to outshoot the Crusaders, 21-15.
“We are very solid defensively,” Caples said. “But we’d like to give up fewer shots. We did a good job [today] of making recovery runs, and we made good intercepts.”
With the clock ticking, the Crusaders put together several desperation series, all of which were stopped by sophomore goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulos, who shined in the second half with two great saves.
Harvard owned an 8-6 edge in penalty corners, and it was able to convert those opportunities into precious goals.
“Overall a good first day,” Caples said about the win. “It was very well played for us. Playing someone else is very different from practice, very different from scrimmages.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the final whistle brought an end to the Harvard women’s soccer team’s season opener against Long Island University on Friday, both teams walked off the field with the same result, but only one team was celebrating.
The Crimson players were in no mood to rejoice after letting a two-goal lead evaporate late in the second half, leading to a 2-2 draw in their first game at the new Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium.
“It was great to score a couple of goals, but it looked like we hadn’t played,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “It’s going to take us some time to get our rhythm together. I’m satisfied with the effort—obviously not the performance—but that will come.”
After two early scores from freshman Peyton Johnson and junior Melanie Baskind and solid defense throughout the first 60 minutes, the Crimson looked to be in control. But late in the second period, things began to unravel quickly for Harvard as the Blackbirds (3-1-1) scored back-to-back goals in less than a minute to even the score with 14 minutes left on the clock.
While both teams had scoring opportunities at the end of regulation and in overtime, neither team was able to convert, leading to the draw—the Crimson’s first since its 2009 season opener.
The squad got its offensive spark from an unlikely source, as Johnson—a rookie defender—helped account for both of Harvard’s goals.
Johnson got the scoring started just seven minutes into the contest, taking a lead pass from junior Patty Yau along the left side of the box, then lobbing it over Long Island goalie Jennifer Bannon into the right corner of the net to give the Crimson the 1-0 lead.
10 minutes later, Johnson contributed to another score, this time by dishing out her first assist. Johnson received the ball near midfield off a Long Island turnover and then sent a long pass ahead to co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh as she streaked toward the goal. Sheeleigh—the Crimson’s leading scorer from 2009—dribbled the ball toward the goal then crossed it in front of the goal to Baskind, who finished the score.
Defensively, Harvard also held strong for the first three quarters of the contest, despite missing two of its starting defenders due to injury.
Rookie defenders Claudia Haeussler and Johnson along with sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet—who finished with eight saves—made their collegiate debuts, helping to keep Long Island off the scoreboard for nearly 75 minutes.
“It was their first game, but you really couldn’t tell,” Leone said. “I think that they showed good confidence, so promising things for the rest of the season for them.”
But after Long Island’s first 15 shot attempts failed to reach the back of the net—including one that ricocheted off the crossbar early in the second period—Nikki Labo managed to convert the first score for the Blackbirds.
Labo headed a cross from Sarah Laughlin past Millet, bringing her team within one. Long Island evened it at two 59 seconds later, this time courtesy of forward Toni Smith. Coming up with possession deep in Crimson territory, Smith raced down the left side of the field and booted it into the top left corner of the cage for the equalizer.
“They were good on their set pieces and they were capitalizing on them,” Leone said. “Also, I think the emotion changed on their side and we didn’t match it.”
Meanwhile, the Harvard offense, which had flowed well in the early going, was coming to a standstill.
“We were just sort of sitting on our heels,” co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “We weren’t finding our forwards and our midfielders like we were at the beginning of the half and weren’t using our attack to get forward.”
But with the score tied, the Crimson caught a second wind late in regulation that carried into overtime, as Harvard outshot the Blackbirds, 4-3, in the extra period after being outshot, 19-9, in regulation. But the Crimson failed to convert on its last four shot attempts, two of which were stopped by the Long Island goalkeeper.
Millet also managed to send away two shots in the extra period—including a breakaway attempt from Smith—to help preserve the 2-2 tie.
“Overtime was just unlucky,” Wideroff said. “We couldn’t find a goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three minutes is all it takes to make a Veritaffle, watch the new Harry Potter trailer, do Shakira’s Waka Waka dance, or make a banana split. Or you can win a soccer game.
In its second matchup of the season, the Harvard women’s soccer team took just over three minutes to grab its first win of the year. The Crimson (1-0-1) recorded a 2-0 shutout against the University of New Hampshire (2-1-2) on Sunday, raising its tally to six consecutive wins against the Wildcats.
“We were pretty consistent the entire game in terms of dominating,” junior Patty Yau said. “I think we were really well connected. They really only had one scoring chance, and that was at the end of the game in the last few minutes.”
Playing with a new formation that involved more players in the midfield, Harvard came into New Hampshire’s Lewis Field looking for some redemption after a shaky 2-2 tie on Friday against Long Island.
“We had a tough tie on Friday so the team certainly bounced back,” co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “We were able to learn from our mistakes at Friday’s game and try to correct them...It was an exciting first win. It felt good, felt really good, to get that win under our belt.”
While the men’s team relied on strong showings from its sophomores on Saturday night, for the Crimson women it was the senior class—led by co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh—that played a starring role. With 1:26 gone on the clock, Sheeleigh smashed a shot that whipped past Wildcat freshman goalkeeper Erica Correa.
“She basically just took on a few defenders and ripped a shot from 20 yards out,” Wideroff said. “It was phenomenal, the goalkeeper had no chance in saving it.”
Two minutes later, Sheeleigh again stole the show, sending a cross to Yau, who tapped it behind Correa for the 2-0 lead.
With a two-goal advantage, the game seemed reminiscent of Friday’s tie against the LIU Blackbirds, but with Harvard sophomore keeper AJ Millet making three saves, the Crimson was able to overwhelm New Hampshire’s Correa with a 17-8 shot advantage.
“I think our first game wasn’t really a true testament to how our team can play,” Yau said. “We were pretty nervous—first-game jitters played a big role. [Sunday] we were very consistent, a lot more connected from the back line to the front. Everyone played well, played together as a unit.”
With the clock ticking down, Harvard seemed controlled but wary that just like against Long Island, a 2-0 lead doesn’t always mean a win.
“That’s always a concern,” Wideroff said. “You know a 2-0 lead is a hard lead to maintain, we obviously experienced that on Friday. But we were in pretty good control for the entire game, and in the second half the ball was in their part of the field for a lot of the half.”
The only concern for Crimson fans came in the final minutes, as New Hampshire senior midfielder Cassie Guerra came charging at Millet.
“One of their forwards had a breakaway in the box, and it was between her and our keeper AJ to get to it,” Yau said. “AJ came out and made a great save and stopped the ball, so that was pretty much the only scoring opportunity they had. We were able to really keep them in their end most of the game.”
Guerra’s shot was the last chance for the Wildcats, as Millet notched her first career shutout and the Crimson tallied its first win of the season, giving hope that this preseason will go better than last year’s 1-5-1 showing.
“Every season is different,” Wideroff said. “Last season we sort of struggled with our first few games, non-conference games, with a pretty bad record, so this year our goal is to compete in these non-conference games.”
“So far we’re doing a really good job,” she added, “but we always have another big test ahead of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Even after its trouble scoring early, Harvard field hockey pulled away from Bryant (0-4) in the second half of yesterday’s game at Jordan Field. The 5-2 win completed a Labor Day weekend sweep for the Crimson, which improved to 2-0 on the young season.
Harvard controlled the game throughout, taking 14 first-half shots. The Bulldogs managed only three, but the game remained tied at one deep into the match—despite the Crimson’s advantage in shots and possession time.
“They are a very strong, physical team, and it took us out of our game plan a little bit and rattled us a little at times,” Harvard coach Sue Caples said. “But we held our own, so this is a good step for us. I think we showed a lot of poise and composure working the ball. Defensively, they were in fall-away press, so we did a nice job being poised with that and bringing the ball upfield.”
The opening half’s only scoring came in the first 10 minutes. Crimson senior Chloe Keating netted her first of three goals just over two minutes into the game, and Bryant answered with a goal of its own after following up on a deflection off sophomore goalie Cynthia Tassopoulos.
“We got a lot of shots and we scored right in the beginning, which gave us a lot of momentum in the first half,” Keating said. “With the help of our defense and Cynthia, our goalie, we were able to stay in it.”
Tassopoulos made four saves on six shots on goal in the afternoon contest.
Harvard also had 10 penalty corners in the first half, including six in the final three minutes, but the team failed to execute on any of the opportunities. The Bulldogs had no corners, much to the frustration of a crowd that seemed to lean in favor of the visiting team.
“We needed to make some better decisions on corners, and the execution needs to be better,” Caples said. “Everyone was just crashing on the ball, and that’s really not hockey. We like a free-flowing passing game.”
Penalty corners remained problematic throughout the course of the game for Harvard. Only on its 11th chance, in the 59th minute of the game, did the team successfully convert the opportunity.
But the Crimson was able to build a comfortable lead before that point, first on a Keating score from the goal line and then on a penalty shot 10 minutes into the second half.
“I think we were just smarter about moving the goalie around,” Keating said. “The keeper was really strong for Bryant, so I think we capitalized off of the rebounds that came off of her pads rather than just trying to get the first shot in.”
Keating led the team in scoring with a hat trick, and junior co-captain Carly Dickson and sophomore Emma Keller each netted goals in the second half to cushion the lead. Dickson and Keller, along with freshman Christy Haughey, also had one assist each.
“Chloe has a little 3-D to her game, which means that she pops the ball up and likes to play it like that,” Caples said. “She penetrates really well, and I think she could have had even more.”
The Bulldogs mounted a modest comeback towards the end of the game, scoring easily and pushing the score to 5-2 on a pass up the middle. Bryant threatened a few minutes later on a penalty shot, but a failure to convert all but sealed the weekend’s second win for Harvard.
“We kind of gutted this one through,” Keating said. “We had a little bit more energy coming in on Saturday...I think we kind of pushed through today.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For a team that lost four of its best players to graduation last year, it could have gone a lot worse.
With old faces gone and new faces present, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (1-2) stepped onto the court at the Harvard Invitational unsure of how it would fare.
The Crimson went 1-2 in the three-game tournament, falling to Eastern Illinois (3-1)and Boston College (4-3) while beating Bryant (4-3) in a tight five-set match.
“Right now we have a very young team, and it’s going to be a huge building year,” sophomore Taylor Docter said. “We have a lot of room for improvement.”
The invitational has a distinctly preseason feel, with lineups being constantly readjusted and teams shaking the rust off.
“It’s a good way to get some competitive games in before we start playing league games,” Docter added. “It’s a good way to get in some practice and learn to play together.”
BOSTON COLLEGE 3, HARVARD 0
Harvard fell, 25-14, 25-15, 25-13, in a convincing win for Boston College on Saturday night in the tournament finale.
“That was a tough one,” said junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll. “They’re a good team, but we didn’t play as we should have been playing. There was kind of a lack of energy on court.”
An upside of the match was the performance of the freshmen. Teresa Skelly and Natalie Doyle led the team statistically, Skelly with six kills and Doyle with 19 assists.
“We had a couple freshman starters, and they really proved themselves,” Ingersoll said. “I know a couple of them were nervous at first, but they contributed a lot and came up with a lot of points.”
At the conclusion of the invitational, Crimson juniors Sandra Lynne Fryhofer and Christine Wu were named to the all-tournament team. Fryhofer had 19 kills over the weekend, while Wu had 62 digs.
HARVARD 3, BRYANT 2
In the second match of the weekend, Harvard rallied back from a 2-1 deficit to narrowly take the victory from Bryant. After falling behind after three sets, 25-22, 18-25, 22-25, the Crimson surged back with 30-28 and 15-12 victories in the last two frames to take the five-set win.
Helping the Harvard cause were Skelly, Fryhofer, and Docter, who all had more than 10 kills in the match, and Wu, who notched 35 digs. Doyle had 34 assists in the match. Skelly and Doyle led the rookies in making an impact.
“[The freshmen] are doing great,” Docter said. “Teresa had a really great weekend.”
After falling behind, 28-27, to the Bulldogs in the fourth set, the Crimson faced match point. But a quick three-point rally won the set for Harvard and put Bryant back under pressure.
“I think that [win] was really good for us,” Ingersoll said. “We knew we still weren’t at our best, but I think it felt good mentally. The fifth set is really a mental game—who wants it more?”
In the fifth set, the Crimson again found itself down and under pressure, with the score 12-11 Bryant. And again, Harvard rallied, winning four straight points to take the fifth set and the match.
EASTERN ILLINOIS 3, HARVARD 1
Harvard could not please the home crowd on Friday night, losing, 25-17, 21-25, 25-13, 25-19, to Eastern Illinois in the season opener.
“We were really excited to play,” Ingersoll said. “Our intensity wasn’t consistent, especially in that game. We could have pulled out another two games to win.”
Docter racked up 14 kills and Wu made 21 digs, both match highs. Fryhofer was second to Docter on the team with a .200 attack percentage.
“Individually, some girls had really good games,” Ingersoll added. “Sandra Lynne really controlled the net.”
The Crimson has two more preseason tournaments in the upcoming weekends, which will serve as preparation for the league season and the ultimate goal of winning the Ivy League Championship.
“It was definitely a jumping-off point,” Ingersoll said. “We hope to work well as a team and keep improving our chemistry so that we can be at our peak at Ivies.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a warm Labor Day afternoon, the No. 10 Harvard men’s soccer team was fittingly hard at work, pulling out a 3-2 victory in an arduous battle with the Massachusetts Minutemen at Rudd Field.
Sophomores Brian Rogers and Scott Prozeller and freshman Ross Friedman all scored for the Crimson (2-0-0). It was Rogers’ second goal in two games and the first of Friedman’s collegiate career.
“It’s huge,” Rogers said of the 2-0 start. “It gave the whole team a lot of confidence...It shows that everything we’re doing in practice and everything the coaching staff is telling us is paying off.”
UMass (0-1-1) got on the board first on a penalty kick, after Harvard was called for an off-the-ball penalty on an indirect kick inside the box. Minuteman forward Bryan Craft knocked it past the fingertips of diving Crimson goalie Austin Harms to give Massachusetts the 1-0 lead at the 18:21 mark.
“I actually think that was a great catalyst to kick-start our energy and really get us playing well,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said of Craft’s goal.
The Crimson was able to strike back at the 44:47 mark. Freshman Kyle Henderson took a corner kick that classmate Connor McCarthy picked up and fired on goal. Prozeller was able to control the rebound of McCarthy’s shot for Harvard and blast the ball inside the left post and past UMass goalie Shane Curran-Hays to tie up the game right before halftime.
“[That goal] turned the tables in terms of energy and momentum,” Junot said.
McCarthy’s shot was only the Crimson’s second on net in a physical first half which featured 24 total fouls and two yellow cards.
Harvard kept up the momentum early in the second period, when Rogers took a cross from co-captain Robert Millock and fired a shot towards the right post and into the net to give the Crimson a 2-1 advantage.
“It was a great ball by Rob,” Rogers said. “I just took it down off my chest and put it in the back of the net.”
The Minutemen had a pair of chances to tie things up in the 57th minute, but a shot by midfielder Ben Arikian was blocked in front of the net by the Harvard defense, and a subsequent attempt by fellow midfielder Stuart Amick hit the crossbar.
In the 71st minute, it was again the freshmen who were making big plays, when Friedman scored on a top-corner header off a cross from the right by Henderson, who picked up his second assist of the game.
“As much as I’m pleased with their production, I’m also pleased with their maturity,” Junot said of his freshmen.
From that point forward, the Minutemen were on the attack, but the two-goal mountain proved too tough to climb. Shots by forward Hellah Sibide and defenseman Andrew Henshaw soared high in the 74th and 75th minutes, respectively. Harms then made an 81st-minute save on an attempt by UMass midfielder Tyler Cleverdon, which proved to be Harms’ only save of the afternoon.
Amick was able to pull his team within one at the 84:58 mark, when he scored on a shot inside the box.
An offsides call on Harvard with under 30 seconds remaining made things interesting, as the Minutemen placed high pressure on Harms with ten men inside the offensive box. But UMass couldn’t muster a shot the rest of the way and the Crimson was able to hold on for victory.
“Overall, we managed the game very well,” Junot said. “It’s always a big challenge to come from behind...I thought we had a good game plan, and I thought the players responded well to what we were trying to do.”
It was certainly a rough game, with 48 total fouls and multiple injury timeouts.
“I don’t like to play that type of game where we have to foul a lot in order to be successful,” Junot said. “But at the same time, I think that’s what was called for the way the game was being played.”
Rogers led the team with four shots and three shots on goal in the winning effort. With the victory, Harvard improved to 8-0-1 against its intrastate rivals since 1985.
“I think our team showed a lot of character today,” Rogers said. “We went down early, but everyone kind of grouped together. We knew we were the better team, so as long as we just kept playing the way we knew we could, we would win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It looks like the third time really is the charm for Harvard men’s water polo.
After dropping its first two games, the Crimson racked up the year’s first win in its third matchup at this weekend’s MIT Invitational. Harvard (1-2) lost to Boston Metro Elite club team, 9-8, and to No. 14 St. Francis, 16-7, on Saturday but came back to defeat Cal Lutheran, 12-8, the next day.
The invitational was not only the 2010 team’s debut, but also the debut of the Crimson’s new water polo coach, Ted Minnis. Coming from his most recent position coaching high school water polo and swimming in Palo Alto, Calif., Minnis is just beginning his career at the collegiate level. But according to his players, the transition has been smooth.
“Ted brings a lot of energy and a lot of water polo expertise to the deck,” sophomore Max Eliot said. “We’re all excited to have him as our new coach this year.”
Along with Minnis, Harvard water polo brought in an impressive class of freshmen, but with three of the six out for the season due to injury, the team was carried by its talented returning players. Seniors Alex Thompson, Jeff Lee, and co-captain Bret Voith led the team in scoring for the weekend.
But Minnis was quick to point out that the squad’s success rested on the shoulders of more than just a few players.
“Almost everybody played some minutes, everybody worked hard out there, and in the end the last game was a definite team win,” he said.
HARVARD 12, CAL LUTHERAN 8
With strong play at both ends of the pool, the Crimson was able to build an early lead against Cal Lutheran (0-4) and hold off the Kingsmen for the 12-8 victory in Sunday’s game.
Both teams started scoring early, and Cal Lutheran was within one goal at the end of the first period, but with some quick passing and fast breaks, Harvard was up 10-7 by halftime.
The second half saw less scoring by the Crimson, which Minnis attributed to a lack of patience and discipline on offense, but powerful defense kept Cal Lutheran nearly scoreless as well.
“We played phenomenal the second half, and we only gave up one goal,” Eliot said. “Once we started listening to our coach, we really got the basics down, and we really got our defense down.”
Junior goalkeeper Alexandre Popp had a total of 11 saves in the game and kept late efforts by the Kingsmen out of the net to secure the win.
ST. FRANCIS 16, HARVARD 7
On Saturday, the Crimson struggled from the beginning against the Terriers (3-0), a consistently tough non-conference opponent. With a four-point lead at halftime and an 11-goal second half, St. Francis dominated the contest, especially on offense.
“Where defense was the key for us [against Cal Lutheran], it really hurt us against the other teams,” Minnis said.
BOSTON METRO ELITE 9, HARVARD 8
In by far the closest of Harvard’s matchups at the invitational, the Crimson battled it out in an exhibition game against Boston Metro Elite, a club team.
The score was even at the half, and Harvard pulled ahead 7-4 partway through the third period. But Boston Metro Elite responded quickly with a run of five unanswered goals.
The Crimson refused to go away quietly and pulled within one in the last few minutes of play. After a late timeout, Harvard had one more chance to even the score, but when Lee’s shot ricocheted off the crossbar, Boston Metro Elite went away with the win.
Despite the early falters, the Harvard team came out of the weekend on a positive note.
“We kept getting better every game and I think that was the key,” Minnis said. “It’s a staircase, and we’re going to climb all season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard football season opener is just 11 short days away, for some ex-Crimson players, the season begins even sooner. Four Harvard alums are on active NFL rosters right now, and at least one of them is likely to start this weekend’s opener. Let’s take a quick look around the league:
James Williams ’10, tackle, Indianapolis
Williams signed with the Colts last month after first inking a contract with Tampa Bay after April’s NFL Draft. He’ll be fighting for playing time at tackle for the defending AFC champions—a program that is very familiar with Harvard players. Clifton Dawson ’07 played for Indianapolis for two seasons, while Andrew Berry ’09 works in the front office as a scouting assistant.
Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09, quarterback
Pizzotti was released by Green Bay in May after being on the Packers’ practice squad since December. He remains unsigned heading into the 2010 season.
Desmond Bryant ’09, defensive tackle, Oakland
Bryant played in all 16 games for the Raiders in his rookie season, making a combined 32 tackles and forcing a fumble. He started two preseason games for Oakland, with his best performance—six tackles, five of which were solo—coming in a 32-17 win over Chicago.
Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05, quarterback, Buffalo
After spending the bulk of his first three pro seasons on the bench, Fitzpatrick has become more of a regular fixture in the NFL in the last two years. He started 12 games for Cincinnati in 2008, completing 59.4% of his passes for eight touchdowns, and then started eight games for the Bills last year, racking up 1,422 yards and throwing nine touchdowns. He’ll start the season as the backup to Trent Edwards.
Matt Birk ’98, center, Baltimore
Easily the most accomplished of the current Harvard NFL players, Birk is entering his 13th professional season and is a six-time Pro Bowler. He’s started every game for the last four seasons and is in the second year of a three-year deal with the Ravens, after spending the first 12 seasons of his career with the Minnesota Vikings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Few people can pronounce his last name, but that doesn’t really matter since #6 of the men’s soccer team rarely hears the loud “BA-BA”s anyways. He’s too much in the zone. Which is why when junior Baba Omosegbon hits the field, teams watch out for the guy who could-have, maybe, hypothetically, perhaps kneed another player in the face, as he explains in this exclusive interview. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Baba Omosegbon
Year: 2012
Position: Defender
Stats: Coming into Harvard with an impressive resume, Baba started freshman year as a dominant force, scoring three goals in his first collegiate season. Starting 17 games his sophomore year, the defender still managed to see the other half of the field, taking shots against soccer powerhouses Maryland and Connecticut, and helping the Crimson claim another Ivy League championship.
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Pasta, grilled chicken, salad, and fruit to eat; "Hulk" powerade (blue and yellow mixed) to drink.
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
I usually just shuffle from my recently played playlist, although one song I listen to and sing aloud before every game (with Brian Rogers) is "Paranoid" by Kanye West. Shout out to Gucci Mane (BURR)
3. Favorite team to play against and why?
Any Ivy game but most notably Brown because it is always a heated contest and we probably like them the least—most apparent by my red card in last year's edition (which shouldn't have been a red card, by the way).
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
What happens in the locker room stays in the locker room.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the court.
Well, we play soccer on a field (pitch), but probably the aforementioned red card incident: in the moment, I was going in for a 50/50 challenge with the goalie, who I happened to know from high school, and the referee claimed that I deliberately went in late to injure him (preposterous!). Upon review of the incident at team video, I concede that it may have been more like 40/60 for him, but contrary to popular belief, I never kneed him in the face.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why.
Probably a panther, not only because my teammates in high school called me one, but also because they are laid back and poised, ready for the next move.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
Apart from the various butcherings of my name, there hasn't really been one particular thing that stands out to me. I can't hear what people say most of the time because I'm too much in the ZONE.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
Tough question. Probably Ice Hockey because skating adds another dimension, and also because NHL '10 is my second favorite Xbox game behind FIFA '10. According to my parents, it was the first sport I ever tried during our short stay in Canada.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
After looking up the positions on Wikipedia, I would probably be a Beater or Chaser. Beater because you get some sort of protection against those ridiculous Bludgers and Chaser because they score the goals.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
Another tough question. Probably Danica Patrick after the Indy 500 so I wouldn't have to go very far. I would take her to Steak n' Shake because they have 4 meals under $4. Best sandwich = Frisco Melt.

A Harvard Business School grad is making big bucks by selling online domain names after the web address ".co" was handed over to him by the Colombian government.
According to the Huffington Post, Juan Diego Calle, a native Colombian and "serial entrepreneur" who graduated in 2007, won the rights to manage .co after the Colombian government changed a law which prompted Internet companies to begin lobbying the government for control of the address.
The Colombian government had owned .co for years but barred almost anyone from registering websites. The .co ending is considered hot online real estate because it could stand for "corporation," "company," or "commercial."
Thirty-two-year-old Calle bid against titans in the industry and managed to win the job, which he called a "surreal experience." Calle and his team officially launched .co on July 20, 2010, and within one minute, 8,000 domains had been registered. As of Sept. 5, 476,980 web addresses have been registered.
Calle, now an Internet real estate magnate, has tried to set the tone for .co with a flashy website that reads "Welcome to the .CO Era" and by giving away .co web addresses free to the top 100 world brands.
Get cozy with .co and check out Twitter or Politico.

We just saw this poster for "Devil," M. Night Shyamalan's upcoming film, on the floor of an elevator in Pfoho. The trailer for the movie will explain why we're amused.

Video game junkies might have new motivation to get off the couch and onto a bicycle, thanks to two new spiffy pieces of exercise equipment in the Dunster House cardio room. Virtual reality meets aerobics in a pair of Trixter stationary bicycles, equipped with interactive screens that, à la Mario Kart, simulate rugged outdoor courses.
Take a trip down to the bowels of Dunster's I entryway to check out the tricked out bikes, which include handlebar brakes, front and rear gear adjustments, a water holder, and some snazzy-looking foot straps. An added bonus: the bikes have a headphone hook-up that tunes into the likes of Cyndi Lauper.
On the software side, the virtual routes vary in difficulty (as we learned, sweatily) and are titled "parkland," "semi-arid," "desert," and "highlands." As you pedal faster (or slower), the virtual (and toned!) legs of your brawny digital counterpart adjust accordingly. Race a (human) friend in "multiplayer" mode.
A warning to the couch potato cohort: this is not exercise-lite. After one lap, this Flyby correspondent was out of breath.

Elena Kagan isn’t the only Harvard Law School graduate working for the Supreme Court this fall. In addition to four other HLS alumni serving as Justices, 11 of this year’s 39 Supreme Court clerks hail from HLS - the largest number from any single law school.
Check out the graph: with five HLS alumni serving as justices and 11 serving as clerks, Harvard appears to be dominating the Supreme Court. 

 
Though 11 is an unusually high number, it is not, by any means, unprecedented - Harvard and Yale Law School graduates have recently tended to fill around half of these highly coveted positions for the legally ambitious. 
 
 
Three of the 11 HLS graduates will work as clerks for Kagan—former dean of HLS— while the others will clerk for Justices Antonin G. Scalia, David H. Souter ’61, Anthony M. Kennedy, Sonia M. Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen G. Breyer.

Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw wrote an article for The New York Times this week, imparting one message to college freshmen around the country: take Economics, preferably using Mankiw’s book.On campus, Mankiw teaches Social Analysis 10: “Principles of Economics,” a fact that is well known to you freshmen who have already crowded into Sanders. But he also holds that adults too can learn. “Pick up an economics textbook (mine would be a fine choice), and you might find yourself learning more than you imagined,” he advises.
Mankiw also recommends taking statistics, finance, and psychology. He argues that statistics teaches students how to crunch numbers, finance teaches them how not to lose their retirement funds by investing in one stock, and psychology humbles classical economics’ assumption that all human beings act rationally in their own self-interest.
But Mankiw’s final recommendation is perhaps humblest of all: “Ignore advice as you see fit.” Ultimately, he writes, college freshmen “should listen to [advice], consider it, reflect on it but ultimately follow their own instincts and passions.”
