José Mateo Ballet Theatre’s October series, “Assault on the Senses,” is not as bone-rattling as the title would suggest, but the three ballets included are both haunting and illuminated with moments of passion. The show, choreographed by Mateo, is running Oct. 6 - Oct. 29 in Sanctuary Theater inside the Old Cambridge Baptist Church, where the audience is seated cabaret-style, up close to the dancers. Sensational staging is impossible here, and the costumes are appropriately minimalist to match the small space, so any sensory shocks must come from the details in the dancers’ movements. Among the three ballets, “Fearless Symmetries” (2008) most successfully takes up this challenge.
“Fearless Symmetries” is buoyed by the punchy, industrial score—John Adams’ “Fearful Symmetries”—and propelled by Junichi Fukuda’s rapturous physical acting. In his athletic solo, his timing while exploding into leaps allows certain notes seemingly to suspend him mid-jump. He is equally alluring in understated acting, as in a moment when his character becomes distracted by a new crowd of sprightly dancers before sheepishly rushing off to find his partner. Lauren Ganther’s cool, confident style suits her role as Fukuda’s seducer.
Ballet traditionally operates within strict gender roles, but in a few refreshing moments, “Fearless Symmetries” unites men and women in similar choreography, costume, and carriage. Sassy shoulder rolls and brisk petit allegro are some of the ballet’s repeating motions, and both the men and women perform them with indistinguishable, lithe gestures. The ballet’s entropic progression toward the discomposure of characters’ relationships and choreography, however, goes beyond the persistent vigor of the first half. The development is most strongly embodied by Magdalena Gyftopoulos, who begins as an anxious partner to Fukuda with sharp gestures and flexed hands and later returns with silky movements as a phantom-like object of attention.
In “Isle of the Dead” (1993), the corps de ballet becomes a visually chilling force that the solo and partnering work in this ballet do not match. The corps dancers strike anguished poses, such as an attitude with head thrown back, to an ominous beat. In one section, they repeatedly crumple to the ground between their grand jetés. Their limbs drag without urgency, as if through molasses, so the dancing feels more impassive and measured than the jagged despair of either the Rachmaninoff score or the Arnold Böcklin painting that inspired it. Unfortunately, even the falls become predictable. The lack of impulsivity makes for a corps that is convincing as an unthinking mass of bodies, but not as a scary one.
James MacMillan’s modernist “Symphony No. 3,” the score of the ballet “Covens” (2003), does not lend itself easily to choreography. With its stretched-out string noise and discombobulated rhythms, it sometimes sounds better suited to the soundtrack for a space film. However, it is based on the story of a witch hunt, an idea that Mateo has abstracted in his choreography to represent mass hysteria. Dancers run across the stage and hurriedly grasp and release hands, as if distrustful, while the patter of their feet serves as rugged percussion.
Like the symphony, the choreography of “Covens” can be frustrating in its denial of any clear story. Certain characters stand out, though. Brittany Bush’s regal posture in her solitary role makes her seem like a power unaffected by the frenzy that has swept up the other characters. A group of male dancers reinforce a forcefully rhythmic moment of the music with an exciting sequence of jumps. In a pas de deux in the ballet’s second half, Angie DeWolf surges into lifts with acrobatic passion, and Spencer Doru Keith matches with intensely attentive gestures. Their chemistry creates enough interest to fully regain any attention lost. It is more fruitful to think of “Assault on the Senses” as thoughtfully probing the senses, rather than assaulting them.

“Black-ish” is at its best when it is loud, black, and proud. The Season Four musical-style premiere (“Juneteenth”) is just that. It is a deliberate decision to make “Juneteenth” a musical episode—approaching a complicated issue like slavery on a half-hour primetime sitcom requires palatable packaging. With that said, the issue is treated with the gravity it requires.
The series is no stranger to tackling contentious matters. The pilot addressed Andre “Dre” Johnson Sr.’s (Anthony Anderson) fear that his success had come with the price of his children lacking knowledge about their own black culture. The show’s second season confronted police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. Issues of race are threaded carefully and delicately throughout the show’s history. Season Four, so far, proves no different.
“Juneteenth” opens with Jack and Diane, Dre’s youngest children, putting on a school play about Columbus. Dre objects to the production, pointing out the racial legacy of Columbus that, in his words, is too often glossed over by many Americans. This is done in typical Dre fashion: His outrage embarrasses the family right out of the auditorium. “Black-ish” is able to use the angry black man trope comedically, because in this case, Dre’s frustration is framed as a rational response to the memorialization of an acutely racist figure. The audience is not laughing at him but at the uncomfortableness of the situation. Spurred by this incident, Dre returns to his job as an advertising executive determined to make Juneteenth—the seldom celebrated June 19th holiday that honors the emancipation of slaves across the former Confederacy—a widely-celebrated holiday.
Dre’s history lessons concerning the holiday take on the form of musical numbers. They do not come off as tonally awkward juxtaposed to the grim content. The episode avoids being showtunes-like, subverting the preconceived notion that musical television episodes tend to be lighthearted and boisterous endeavors. The music is somber, styled after African slave spirituals and largely set on a fantasy Johnson home in the antebellum South. However, the standout musical number from the episode is the uncomfortably cheerful yet comedic transformation of the Schoolhouse Rock’s “I’m Just a Bill” song into a song about slavery.
Dre’s indignation is not enough for him to garner the support of his colleagues. His frustration, as he expresses his disappointment to Bow, his wife, is a particularly poignant moment in the episode. The episode allows Dre to communicate his stance in a clear and unflinching manner. The other side of the issue is presented as nothing more than a willful submission to the status quo. His family and colleagues counter that people’s uneasiness over slavery will always prevent the celebration of Juneteenth, but the off-handed way in which they deliver their points fail to match the gravity of Dre’s argument.
It is a moment that perfectly encapsulates the contradictions of being black and being an American. When Dre expresses his discontent, others around him can only articulate the futility of his goals. They understand that America’s inability to confront slavery is a problem, but they also acknowledge that the avoidance of slavery is a fixture of American society. The only way for black people to proceed is by taking ownership of their own history—and not waiting for the rest of the country to do so. Ultimately, this leads the Johnsons to decide that even if the rest of America will not celebrate Juneteenth, their family surely will.
It is a powerful and much needed episode. After the tragedy of Charlottesville, the clash over Confederate statues, and the controversy surrounding players kneeling in the NFL, racial tensions are high in the United States. “Black-ish” does not use growing racial tensions as an excuse to back away from its past convictions.

Vampire Weekend’s frontman Ezra Koenig has a very specific sense of humor. His Twitter, which has amassed a cult following among conscious consumers of popular counterculture, is basically a collection of the usual petitions and articles critiquing the current presidential administration interspersed with highly esoteric jokes. Koenig composes his subtly funny all-lowercase tweets about tasteful palette 70s film, Fidel Castro wearing two Rolex watches at once, and half-hearted text responses, among other things.
Koenig’s idea to create “Neo Yokio,” an anime that takes place in New York City and stars Jaden Smith (another master of the ironic tweet), Steve Buscemi, Susan Sarandon, Tavi Gevinson, and Richard Ayoade, to name a few, might as well have been another one of his viral tweets. Ironically, it’s an actual Netflix original with six 20-minute episodes.
“Neo Yokio” is a delicately caricatured representation of NYC, evocative of the style of mainstream children’s anime (“Pokémon,” “Sailor Moon,” “Yu-Gi-Oh!,” etc.), and faithful to the city itself. Cartoonish-looking Kandinsky imitations line the spiraling walls of the Guggenheim, while the embellishments of the Washington Square Park arch are intricately drawn. Even the protagonist’s fictional prestigious prep school, The Easton School, is an exact replica of The Dalton School.
The show is also jam-packed with the same esoteric humor that populates Koenig’s Twitter feed. Protagonist Kaz Kaan (voiced by Smith) becomes the poster boy for a Caprese Martini campaign (“Tomato, basil, and mozzarella, but it gets you lit!”). He asks students at Easton to write hundred-word essays on “the graceful geometry of cableknit sweaters” and can’t say no to squid ink fettucine. Gevinson, a famous young fashion blogger with a cult following, plays Helena St. Tessero, a famous young fashion blogger with a cult following (called the Helenists, which is only really funny if you’re familiar with ancient Greco-Roman history). Helena speaks in recognizable pop-progressivism one-liners about “a culture built on hatred, greed, and the subjugation of the working class.” The show even has an unexpectedly solid grasp on regional slang—a character describes Kaz’s outfit as “OD gothic” and calls him “B.”
Supported by all these very specific and highly conceptual jokes, the plot is some formulaic nonsense about beating the bad guys with magic powers. It’s really only there to showcase the incisive but somewhat warm and goofy exploitation of rich kid stereotypes designed for intellectual and “edgy” young people who interact with members of the creative elite, like Koenig, Gevinson, Smith, Buscemi, etc.

The best of historical dramas are incredible narratives with just enough grounding in facts to let you pretend you’re learning. From “Vikings” to “The Americans,” these shows will help you procrastinate on the CS50 problem set you should be finishing.
5. The AmericansPerhaps the most relevant show on this list in the face of current events is “The Americans.” Set in the 1980s, it follows two deep-cover Soviet agents posing as a married American couple. As our modern political reality disintegrates around us in the face of Russian efforts to destabilize democracy, it’s nice to be able to escape to the exact same thing, but thirty years ago. Mostly unchanged by its newly found relevance, the show does a great job of staying mostly historical with a few added dramatic flourishes. “The Americans” bring great performances from the cast, incredible set and costume design, and well-selected musical accompaniment.
4. Turn: Washington's SpiesAMC’s hit show “Turn” is another great American drama. Set during the Revolutionary War, “Turn” tells the story of George Washington’s spy ring, the first American intelligence agents. The show weaves easily between the American rebels, British loyalists, and colonists trapped between the two. Though it’s chock-full of suspense and subterfuge, the show is at its best when it is exploring the relationships between its characters. Whether it’s dealing with the main character Abraham Woodhull’s (Jamie Bell) complex feelings about his wife—whom he married because she was engaged to his brother before his death—or Anna Strong’s (Heather Lind) fake relationship with the British commander of their town, “Turn” is one of those rare shows with a real knack for character-driven drama.
3. DeadwoodOn the other side of the pond lies a classic of American television: “Deadwood.” Perhaps the greatest—and most honest—Western there is, “Deadwood” is nothing like the sanitary, sugarcoated version of the Wild West sold by Hollywood throughout the late 20th century. It’s dirty and brutal, like it should be. Strong performances make it easy to be drawn into the world, helped along by the hypnotic cadence of the ornate writing. “Deadwood” is filled with clever turns of phrase and commitment to verbal play. One particularly compelling character, Al Swearengen (portrayed by the incomparable Ian McShane), refers to children as “issue of thy loins.” Based on historical accounts of the real mining town of Deadwood, this is an HBO classic well worth your time.
2. The Last Kingdom“The Last Kingdom” is set a generation after “Vikings.” Though the show deviates somewhat from the historical lore, the basic storyline is the same. Ragnar Lothbrok’s son Ivar the Boneless brings an army of Danes into England over the course of the 9th century, slowly conquering parts of England until only one independent kingdom remains: Wessex. “The Last Kingdom” follows Uhtred of Bebbanburg (Alexander Dreymon), a fictional character created by author Bernard Cornwell in the book series of the same name. A Saxon raised by Danes, Uhtred’s shared heritage provides the audience with both sides of the conflict, as Uhtred’s loyalty to each waxes and wanes over the course of the years. While it’s not quite on par with the all-around excellence of “Vikings,” “The Last Kingdom” tells a compelling narrative in a richly detailed medieval world.
1. Vikings“Vikings” is a truly incredible show. Set during the early Middle Ages, it follows the conquering path of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking warlord described in Scandinavian sagas and in Medieval manuscripts. Ragnar is a fierce warrior and a proto-statesman, uniting disparate Viking tribes in order to raid France and England. “Vikings” does great justice to the Ragnar of legend, with truly breathtaking performances from Travis Fimmel selling the character on screen as the same one from those ancient manuscripts. Alongside other great actors—chief among them Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), Ragnar’s wife, and Floki (Gustaf Skarsgård), Ragnar’s oldest friend and medicine man—Fimmel brings Ragnar’s story to life.

If I were to choose my favorite TV shows of all time, Bill Lawrence’s comedy-drama “Scrubs” (2001 to 2010) would definitely make the list—it stands out from all the other run-of-the-mill medical series that only call attention to themselves through their mediocrity and predictability. “Scrubs” takes the viewer through the whole range of human emotions in a single episode. Most of the time, it is hilariously funny and absurd (the hospital’s janitor: “I don’t believe in the moon. I think it’s just the back of the sun”). The comedic writing is fast-paced, the joke density is high—and thankfully, there is no laugh track. In fact, due to its hysterical, well-quotable humor, “Scrubs” would do very well for itself if it was nothing but a comedy. But when tragedy strikes, oh, does it strike! Out of the blue, characters’ lives are shattered. Yet the show also manages to be deeply touching and beautiful as it spreads its wisdom about life and human nature.
“Scrubs” would not be able to inflict such wide-ranging emotions on its audience if its characters were not as relatable and likable as they are. The protagonists, who are all well-written, well-cast, and well-acted, exhibit a behavioral complexity that makes it possible for the viewer to identify with each one of them. Take young physician and first-person narrator John “J.D.” Dorian (Zach Braff). While he’s a great doctor with hysterical daydreams, he also suffers from low self-esteem and always seeks the approval of his mentor, Dr. Percival “Perry” Cox (John C. McGinley). Dr. Cox is inaccessible, bitter (“[People are] bastard-coated bastards with bastard filling”), narcissistic, constantly sarcastic and demeaning, has problems with alcoholism—yet he also cares an incredible amount about his patients and has a secret respect for J.D. This combination of good and bad character traits result in the protagonists of “Scrubs” being three-dimensional and, thus, lovable.
But it is not only the characters in isolation who make the show so thoroughly enjoyable—it is also their lifelike relationships with each other. The on-screen chemistry between J.D. and his best friend Turk, a surgeon, is unmatched by any other TV bromance—perhaps because the two are actually best friends in real life as well. Likewise, there is J.D.’s on-off relationship with his neurotic, driven colleague Elliot, the antagonism between Dr. Cox and Dr. Kelso, the Chief of Medicine (who only seems to care about the hospital’s budget), and head nurse Carla’s devotion to interns who find in her a mother figure in the rough hospital environment.
As if that weren't enough, “Scrubs” excels at song choices, among them The Fray’s “How to Save a Life” and John Cale’s rendition of “Hallelujah.” Through this combination of deeply humanistic depictions and heart-wrenching music, the show creates an emotional attachment to its protagonists that makes it hard to stop watching.

After a six-year hiatus, comedian Larry David is back to playing his best role: himself.
David is the creator and star of the HBO hit comedy “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which returned six years after its Season Eight finale for its Season Nine premiere. “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” much like David’s other famous project, “Seinfeld,” is essentially about nothing. The show follows the everyday life of a fictitious version of David who seems to find something annoying about everything and often offends or insults someone through his actions and brash behavior.
The show begins with the camera panning over a Santa Monica neighborhood. Initially, this first shot seems too professional and clean to be in an episode of “Curb,” which was defined in its earlier season by gritty and unedited cuts. But then, the camera zooms into David’s house and cuts to a scene of the 70-year-old New York Jewish American singing in the shower and struggling to open a container of soap. Don’t be fooled by its modern aesthetic—“Curb Your Enthusiasm” is back.
“Curb Your Enthusiasm” is such a hit comedy because it focuses on the little annoyances, events, and stereotypes of everyday life. As Larry walks into his manager Jeff’s office building to discuss his new play, he pauses to hold the door for someone but then notices her appearance and believes she is too far away. Short-haired and sporting a tie, the woman confronts Larry about his decision not to hold the door. He responds by saying that she didn’t seem like the type of person who would want to have the door held for her, citing a lesbian stereotype, and adds that she was too far away. The result is an uncensored onslaught of insults and expletives, courteous of HBO’s cable programming.
Cringeworthy scenes such as the door incident are what make the show so amusing. In this episode, Larry also deals with an incompetent secretary “foisted” on him by Jimmy Kimmel. The secretary tells Larry that she had been gone for two days due to constipation, and Larry finds her reasoning to be weak. Later, he tells this to his roommate, Leon, who replies by saying that he once filmed a porno and participated in a hot dog eating contest constipated, and won. Ridiculous and impressive, David and the rest of the cast continue to make audiences laugh by centering on the uncomfortable and awkward moments of everyday life.
One of the unique aspects of “Curb Your Enthusiasm” is that most of the show is ad libbed. For each episode, David and the other writers produce a six-to eight page outline that contains little to no dialogue. This gives the show an authentic feel and allows the characters to get creative in their roles. Typically, all of the insults thrown at David are completely made up by the actors. Susie Greene, the wife of David’s manager, is known for her nasty insults, and she doesn’t hold back in the Season Nine Premiere.

“Curb Your Enthusiasm” picks up right where it left off six years ago. Hysterical and absurd, the Season Nine premiere will not disappoint either the diehard fan or the casual viewer.

“Am I dead?”
Thus, begins Kesha’s “Praying” video. She is lying in a casket with a huge cross behind her while two figures wearing the heads of pigs stand on either side. It cuts to a black-and-white image of her lying on wood floating on water. She questions a possible higher power about her suffering. The references to her suffering might be a reference to a civil court’s dismissal of her sexual assault, harassment, and gender violence allegations against music producer Dr. Luke.
The video, like the song, differs greatly from Kesha’s other videos. It purposefully showcases Kesha’s vulnerabilities by, quite literally, having her on her knees as if she were praying and having tears roll down her face. She no longer shows an uncaring attitude, as in “Tik Tok.” Emotion is in the spotlight of the video.
The costumes and props are all colorful and light, which works to contrast some of the scenes’ inherently melancholic components and helps with the transition to inspirational aspects of the video. Kesha paints her face with neon colors. Her costumes feature feathers, glitter, and butterflies. Many of the props are religious symbols such as crosses, candles, and angel wings. Mid-video, a variety of television screens show questions relating faith, truth, and God. Other similar messages appear in other parts of the video, such as “God is love.” “Standards of beauty”—Kesha has spoken about struggling with eating disorders in the past—is a phrase that pops out.
The video matches the music in that the song starts off lonely and questioning. We first see Kesha alone in the video, drifting on wood, and later walking by screens questioning God and beauty standards. Subsequently, she gets off the plank on the water when a colorful bird inspires her to stand, and she smashes the TV screens. It signifies her fighting for herself.
This video successfully works alongside the song to recognize hardship, yet simultaneously inspires advocacy for oneself. Kesha was not going to let herself die—unlike Taylor Swift.

One of my favorite pieces of music is a short text by viola player and writer Martine Thomas ’18. The piece is titled “path”:
1 leave all possessions
behind 2 walk out
side 3 pick a
straight path 4 listen for
where you are 5 do not open
your eyes when you feel
afraid do not open
your eyes when you
lose a sense of place
6 open your eyes only
when you think you
have reached the end
of the path. 7—walk
[steady, straight, assured,
unburdened]
I encountered this piece nearly two years ago. Since then, I have come to know Martine as a friend, a classical violist, a writer, and more. Amidst all of these, this piece, “path,” continues to return and resonate with me, influencing the way I listen to music, to nature, and to the people around me.
The first time I performed “path,” I was outside of Holden Chapel behind Hollis. I marked out a straight path along the asphalt pathway, towards Harvard Hall. The low, soothing drone of a Hollis air conditioning unit passed my left ear as I walked. The impact of my rubber soles on the asphalt pathway made deadened taps, cushioned by quiet crunches from pebbles and other debris. Distant whirring from vehicles on Mass Ave. gently filled out the background. Every sound became hyper-present, as if our sonic outlook had moved from a standard to a high definition screen. An air conditioner had never before seemed so noticeable. Crunching asphalt debris had never before brought me back to memories of childhood, carefully placing my bare feet on pebbled paths, hearing the soft compression of tiny rocks, feeling them push against my soles. I heard car horns and whirring tires, sounds I hear every day as I wake up in Adams House. It was only in that moment though that I felt so aware of how different Harvard Square was from Orange County, California, where I had spent the first 18 years of my life. That 20-foot walk toward Harvard Hall uncovered not only the physical sounds around me, but also the nostalgia, pilgrimage, homesickness, and ambition that had underscored my Harvard career up until that point. It wasn’t that air conditioners, pebbles, or Mass Ave. were anything inherently special. In performing “path,” though, I heard these sounds up close. And with that proximity, all the internal change I had undergone during my time at college emerged as well.
Martine later told me she performs this piece every so often when she is walking through Harvard Yard, along the Charles, over a bridge. Not that she performs the “piece” explicitly; she just closes her eyes and listens as she walks to class. A lot of my conversation with Martine tends to focus on sounds she has heard, or things she has seen, as she goes about her day. Last week we talked about the construction at the to-be-renovated Lowell, and how it is easily heard from Kirkland. We also talked about a leaf she posted on Instagram, because she noticed it on the ground as she was walking through the yard. We talked about J. S. Bach’s Chaconne for violin, an intensely beautiful and difficult piece whose exertions are doubly demanding when played on the viola, the instrument she is studying at New England Conservatory. Martine’s longstanding love for Bach’s music comes from the way in which she can keep returning to it day after day, year after year, and continue to discover personal significance in it. Upon hearing that, I couldn’t help but visualize Martine in a practice room playing through the Chaconne, listening for where she is in the music, continually sensing and evaluating her place in the path she has marked out in the score, not dissimilar at all to a performance of “path.”

“Getting laid is a medical directive.” As astounding as it may seem, this is the doctor’s prescription for Bobby Goldman, a recently widowed woman. Tony-nominated Nancy Opel stars as Bobby, who loses her husband in her mid-fifties and enters the dating scene shortly after. Directed by Peter Flynn, the show is running Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre in New York City through the end of the year.
Strutting out on stage in sparkling pearls and an embroidered blazer, Bobby radiates confidence and charm in the opening musical number, “Under Control.” Her life turns blue with the stage lights, however, as tolling bells signal her husband’s death and, suddenly, “everything is not under control.” But she is Bobby Goldman after all, and the song quickly recovers from the bridge as Bobby regains what she thinks is control of her life.
Starting life anew, “White Box Loft” effectively portrays the process of physical and emotional rebuilding: Bobby trades her Upper East Side penthouse for a brick-walled loft downtown, her blazers for leather jackets. She announces that she’s finally about to live the life of “the young and the hip instead of the old and the hipless.”
Bobby’s dead husband, Jim, reappears as a ghost throughout the musical, always clad in a robe reminiscent of Dickens’ Ghost of Christmas Past. Ken Land exhibits a lackluster spirit in the role, as perhaps his character exhibits for Bobby. He haunts Bobby at her weakest points—before her first Match.com date, on a lonely Christmas Eve night, and right after she denies a new lover’s request to move in. Jim’s appearance each time, though unwelcome, is a strategic reminder that Bobby has yet to move on from her familiar past.
The ensemble pieces shine in their clean execution and a unified flair amongst the supporting cast. As Bobby stumbles through unsuccessful date after date, she opens up her pool to married men, “Looking For.” Meanwhile, Bobby’s girlfriends swoon and chatter over her new man, Per Se (Christopher Shyer), as they kick and squat through Marcos Santana’s clean choreography of a cardio burn Wednesday class in “The One.” Her loyal companions, Caroline (Andrea Bianchi), Heidi (Elizabeth Ward Land), and Joan (Aisha de Haas) circle around and comfort her during her loss, offering her steak dinners and desserts, but ultimately portray friendships that are shallow, unsupportive “girl-flirting.”
The story, adapted from Bobby Goldman’s autobiography, shines under Drew Body’s witty lyrics. As Bobby creates her Match.com profile, she sings, “Height? 5’6. Weight? F*** off!” Crude humor makes its way throughout the lyrics, but Bobby’s age and wanna-be-sexy dance moves keep the characters demure.
Though several decades older, Bobby’s lovable clumsiness and soul-searching adventures make her a relatable figure for the young struggling college student. After all, though college may be too early for most to become widows, it’s certainly a time for adolescents to confront quintessential life crises and embrace their curvy selves.

Season Two of HBO’s “Vice Principals” picks up exactly where it left off—Neil Gamby (Danny McBride), one of the titular vice principals hoping for a promotion, has been shot. He believes that it was Belinda Brown, the former principal, who shot him. However, Russell (Walton Goggins)—another vice principal and Gamby’s friend—confirms that it was simply a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time: “It was a stereo thief, and you spooked him.” Gamby’s desire to figure out who shot him despite Russell’s better suggestion becomes the driving plot device of the episode.
Unfortunately, the show relies too much on exaggeration to contribute to the humor and often fails to deliver comedy. The music and the acting is overly dramatic. Often the scenes are played in slow motion, and montages add to the juvenile silliness of the comedy. There were a few lines that were very quotable, but that alone could not transform it into a workable piece of comedy.
The episode heavily relied on the over exaggeration of certain actions the actors take or words they say. Gamby plays up the fact that he was shot: “Perhaps but I’ll never be the same again.” In another scene, he sits in front of a heavily used detective board as he attempts to solve his shooting. It is meant to be funny because no one else cares to continue the investigation—the police have already solved it. However, the overt absurdity of the scene kills any chance of funniness.
The music also added to this over exaggeration by being purposefully slow or overly exciting. The music deliberately played up cliché tropes. For example, as he looks at the murder-suspect board, fast-paced yet soft music reminiscent of the score from a spy or detective movie plays in the background. After Russell calls Gamby “a beached whale,” the music turns into a motivational mantra while Gamby gets up without the aid of a wheelchair. This is all ridiculous since the audience, as well as the characters, know that Gamby can walk. This is presumably meant to add to the humor, but it is only exaggeration without comedy.
Furthermore, the episode takes advantage of slow motion to bring more false drama into the episode. The episode begins with Gamby having a dream in which he is wearing a Native American feather headdress (which is problematic appropriation), and school officials, teachers, and students are running around him. Then, a tiger appears. All of this is done in slow motion until he is woken up. This continues to add to the purposeful exaggeration of events. Yet, it continues to fail to bring humor to the episode, instead dragging out an unnecessary part of the episode.
However, there were a few very quotable lines in “Tiger Town.” For example, Gamby tells Russell off at the pond where they discuss Gamby’s future at the school, “I don’t need your artificial painkillers. I have my ducks.” These lines are the only parts of the episode where the exaggeration actually works to construct comedy. They straddle the line between funny and ridiculous.
Ultimately, however, the episode failed to attain its goal of comedy, and relied too much on exaggeration in the acting, music, and effects. A few hilarious lines saved the episode from being a total disaster.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Noah Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),” starring Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller, is like a pair of Crocs: unapologetically comedic from the outside, but profoundly comforting to anyone who would just give them a chance. Audiences are slipping their feet into a film that doesn’t try to be something it’s not. Baumbach doesn’t attempt to hide the fact that he is addressing the conventional question of the mid-life crisis (“What is a life well-lived?”). It is in the nuts and bolts of his film—from the script to the camera to the acting—that he brings a revived gravity to this question.
Opening with a slightly clichéd exploitation of New York City’s lack of parking and a whole lot of witty-ish dialogue between Danny Meyerowitz (Sandler) and his daughter Eliza Meyerowitz (Grace Van Patten), the film is off to a bit of a worrisome start. Even so, the pair snag an impressive number of legitimate chortles before arriving at the home of Danny’s father Harold Meyerowitz (Dustin Hoffman), where several solid Jew jokes about the arts, hummus, and noses establish that this is, thank God, a quality script. Though the character-character exchanges are fast-paced and focus-required, Baumbach keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, wanting to hear the next wisecrack because they’re really just that funny. The viewer can’t really hope to catch them all but somehow knows that this is totally fine, intentional even: From mocking pokes at the endeavors of college artists, especially filmmakers, to almost depressingly true humor about the twisted paths to fulfillment in life, there is more than a little something for everyone.
Sectioned into a series of vignettes, the film first fixates upon Sandler’s dismally middle-aged personage: a freshly-divorced failed pianist with daddy issues. His brother Matthew (Ben Stiller), around whom Baumbach’s second vignette centers, is an unhappy embodiment of society’s definition of success: a rich private wealth manager. As the brothers and their sister recognize just how much damage their father has inflicted, they grapple with the conflict between bitterly blaming him and loving him regardless.
What makes this film different is that it is aware of its clichéd message, but the best part is that its cast knows, too. Their masterful performances make evident their knowledge that it is not what this film communicates that matters, but how it is communicated. Baumbach’s picture is rendered pointedly and painfully true to life by its near-flawless casting. Clearly a passion project for Sandler and Stiller, whose careers seemed to have ended with the snafus that were “Pixels” and “Zoolander 2,” “The Meyerowitz Stories” gains life through the pair’s surprising on-screen chemistry, so much so that the audience might wonder whether they are biological brothers in real life. Not to be overlooked, Hoffman’s intentionally awkward mannerisms and stiff line-delivery make for a beautiful yet frustrating portrayal of a deeply troubled father. And who knew that Emma Thompson, as Harold’s alcoholic third wife, could be so convincingly distasteful yet simultaneously endearing?
The film derives amusement not only with its clever script and excellent acting, but also its visual storytelling. The camera is not only a lens through which the audience watches the story unfold, but also another actor with its own hilarious way of seeing the world. Intermittent still frames from the least expected perspectives and frequent swings between its fellow co-stars in action contribute both to the development of their characters and to that of its own, building upon the foundation of the cast’s already poignant performances.
Baumbach has done it. Amusing, momentous, and amusingly momentous, “The Meyerowitz Stories” leaves the audience chuckling wistfully. Such is life: funny and convoluted and unsatisfying. However, the audience knows this—other films have repeatedly told them so. What is different? Unashamed, Baumbach’s movie marches forth with a sincerity that pulls on heartstrings the audience didn’t know it had.

After a bit of a break from touring, Paramore began “Tour 2” this summer with a dual purpose: to unify their shifting band members and to give a show both full of surprises and able to recapitulate the band’s entire 13 years together. Tour 2 arrived in Boston on Oct. 7 with Paramore’s rocked-out show at the Boston Opera House. The younger audience proved that the classic Noughties rock band’s foray into poppier climes with their newest album “After Laughter” is garnering them new, enthusiastic followers. Those there purely for the throwback kicks, however, were by no means forgotten. (Anyone expecting a high standard of sound quality, however, left disappointed.)
Screaming teenagers (and, curiously, some old fogey dads) crammed into Boston Opera House for a set that roiled across hard rock to brighter pop beats. Irrepressible lead singer Hayley Williams literally kicked off the concert with “Hard Times,” the lead single from their new album, with hair swishes, high-kicks and pirouettes that she kept up without pause for the next two hours. Swirling, brightly coloured projections onto the back of the stage in concentric rings added extra verve. The synth-pop sounds belied the band’s willingness to change with the alt-indie times, yet the rest of the crowd-pleasing opening set proved they are still Paramore through and through. Williams yelled “Ignorance,” a song from their “Brand New Eyes” album, through a megaphone into the mic to a blizzard of strobes, before successfully cutting to the unashamedly fun and dweebish schoolgirl cries of “Still Into You.”
Williams’ humor was also on top form during a concert of numerous gags and one amusing stunt involving crazy ghost costumes. During their sing-a-long hit “Brick by Boring Brick,” an over-excited fan threw a drink onto stage. Williams asked if anyone wanted a lemon before lobbing one into the crowd and jumping into the accusational “Playing God.” A number of slower, melancholic songs and an upbeat cover of Fleetwood Mac’s “Everywhere” prompted Williams to reassure the audience that their hard rock credentials should not be stripped from them. She then cast everyone’s minds back to 2007 and reminded us all of our dodgy hairstyles from back then (shudder), before charging into the band’s top hit “Misery Business.” In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the song and the enduring love of their fans, some lucky girls dressed in ghost costumes (no explanation given) were the chosen three who got to live out the dream of blasting out the last chorus on stage.
It was the quieter, introspective tracks, however, that proved to be the surprise highlight of the evening. Joking that “Riot” was probably written in reaction to the saccharine-sweet musical “Hairspray,” Williams justified the need to sing more vulnerable songs to “speak our hearts” while maintaining the band is as angry as ever. The country strains of the compassionate “Hate to Hear Your Heartbreak” from their self-titled fourth album speaking to the band’s Tennessee roots led to a sincerely moving rendition of the new song “26.” The acoustic strums of long-term lead guitarist Taylor “T” Yorke and gentle lilts of Williams’ voice deftly shifted the mood to solemnity.
The only problem was that the songs were not the only hit of nostalgia; the noisy sound quality was a terrible reminder of the half-broken cheap CD player on which many in the audience might have heard their first tracks as tweenagers.
The defiant and upbeat “Ain’t It Fun” nevertheless had the crowd dancing around by the end of the main set, ready for an encore that celebrated the band’s reunification with drummer Zac Farro and touring band members. When the only constant member of 13-year-old Paramore is Williams, introducing the band members is pretty necessary. Farro was welcomed back after a six-year hiatus by swapping him in as lead singer for a song. Touring guitar members also got their spot in the limelight, but it was T, current lead guitarist and fellow songwriter since 2007, who inevitably received the biggest cheer from the adoring fans. It was therefore only fitting that the ever-evolving band finished up with “Rose-Colored Boy,” the most striking expression of their move into ’70s-esque technopop.
“Tour 2, 3, 4 to infinity!” Williams proclaimed. Paramore has certainly earned its survival stripes by coming back with “After Laughter.” To quote one of their own lyrics: “There’s a time and a place to die, but this ain’t it.”

Three years have passed since the release of Jhené Aiko’s debut album “Souled Out,” and fans of the songstress’s classic, sensual vocals will be pleased to find that surprise album “Trip” is well worth the wait. Like its predecessor, “Trip” is the consequence of a total emotional experience in which Aiko encounters darkness, falls victim to it, and eventually finds the strength within herself to begin the process—and a lengthy one, at that—of introspection and healing. Though it comes in at a whopping 22 tracks, nothing about Aiko’s sophomore album feels superfluous. Each song is undeniably an essential part of the trip, and Aiko—a master storyteller—refuses to spare her listeners any of the raw details of her long, drug-fueled journey to self-realization.
Aiko’s ascent into psychedelia commences in “LSD” when she takes “a tiny piece of paper and puts it under [her] tongue,” effectively launching her into an exploration of herself in relation to the unknown. Immediately, the rhythm slows to a dreamy throb, and “Jukai” begins, with Aiko questioning her worldly significance. “If I died,” she wonders, “would it even make a sound in the sea of trees?”
Yet the possibility of death does not seem to frighten Aiko, who instead uses the prospect of her eventual demise to justify her daring behavior in “When We’re Young”: “Baby, while we’re young we should just have fun / Like say f**k everyone.” She recognizes the ephemerality of her life, and in a typically Aiko-esque fashion, explores this impermanence through seductively smooth vocals that ultimately continue to flow into “Moments,” an amorous song about appreciating our time with loved ones, complete with a guest appearance by her beau, Big Sean.
The idea of the brevity of life is an essential, ever-present theme throughout the album, and perhaps comes to a blissful apogee in “OLLA (Only Lovers Left Alive),” another collaboration with Big Sean, in which Aiko and her lover—despite the “fireballs falling out of the sky”—continue to cherish each other’s presences. This post-apocalyptic jam is intoxicating and highly danceable, but Aiko and Big Sean are too caught up in their infatuation with one another, and neither seem to really consider the repercussions that the end of the world may have on their relationship.
The euphoria, however, slowly fades in “When We Love,” as Aiko’s relationship insecurities begin to bubble up (“Don’t lose me, don’t lose me / Don’t choose me then use me / Just stay right beside me / Don’t you dare deny my love”). Instead of addressing these concerns, however, a male voice, presumably that of her lover, shuts her down and offers her a hit of marijuana, cuing “Sativa,” featuring Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee. Upbeat and fun, “Sativa” has Aiko feeling good—so good that she has become temporarily numb to her aforementioned anxieties.
Of course, it’s only a matter of time before Aiko’s high crashes, and it begins to do so in “Newer Balance-Freestyle.” After affirming her absolute love and commitment to her lover in the previous track, “New Balance” (“You’re my salvage / You’re my balance”), Aiko is once again overcome by uncertainty: “It would really be a shame / If you are just running game on me.” She deepens these doubts in “You Are Here,” in which a paranoid Aiko ponders the possibility of her relationship falling apart. Aiko has been through heartache before and fears her current relationship could inevitably end in a similar anguish. Such images are conjured up in “Never Call Me,” a track on which Aiko woefully admits that her previous relationship was destined to fail: “You knew all along that I wasn’t the one for you / So let’s stop pretending like we were in love / We never shared anything but the drugs / We were both numb, never had anything real between us.”
At this point, Aiko, overwhelmed by her vulnerabilities, takes a plunge into the dark. She declares her apathy and disdain towards the world around her in “Nobody,” and then immediately enters into her own personal nightmare, accompanied by chilling vocals and literal screams. Arguably the darkest, most horrific track on “Trip,” “Overstimulated” features a frightened Aiko demanding an explanation for her misery  (“What the f**k did you give me / Did you see that? / Get me out of here / Why would you do this to me?”). Her cries for mercy continue—unanswered—in “Bad Trip.”
But Aiko’s hellish visions eventually pass, and she slowly begins to find the strength within herself to arise from her own personal hell in “Oblivion (Creation).” She realizes that there are indeed repercussions for placing so much emotional capital in drugs and men. She perhaps needs to find it in herself to heal, rather than seek it externally. Her self-reflection continues in “Psilocybin (Love in Full Effect),” in which she thoughtfully commits to beginning the process—one that she recognizes will take time—of healing (“Open up your mind and you’ll feel it, the healing / Go slowly, so slower / No need to rush it”).
By the end of “Trip,” Aiko begins to break free from her horror, vowing to accept a path of redemption for herself in “Ascension,” with the understanding that she will have to emancipate herself from her grief (“I’m on my way, I’m on my way to heaven / I’m on my way, if I can make it out of this hell / I know I can and I know I will”). Her affirmation is restated in the confident, ruminative final track of the album, “Trip” (Who can save me? / You can’t, baby”).
Although the length of “Trip” may cause it to lose some listeners, it is truly a masterpiece of an album. Sustained by Aiko’s provocative lyricism, “Trip” is brilliant, encapsulating the highs and lows of our vocalist’s rocky voyage of self-examination and soul-searching. Measured and beautifully arranged, “Trip” is by all definitions an experience that does not disappoint.

Behind closed doors on weekend nights, rooms and houses across Harvard’s campus become dance floors and impromptu bars. Above the bobbing heads and laser beams at larger events is often the mind behind the music: the disc jockey. Some have years of musical background, while others are just playing with the equipment for the first time to help a friend host a party. The Crimson set out to find out more about those who turn the tables while their friends are dancing on tables.
The term “disc jockey” was first introduced in the 1930s as a name for radio announcers who wove music into their programs. In the next few decades, vinyl records came to the fore and DJs became more associated with people who just mixed music.With the rise of software technology in audio systems, however, many DJs today learn the art through CDJs, popular devices that DJs can play digital music on, instead of turntables. Though much depends on the individual DJ and some stick to the traditional equipment, a new tech-savvy generation is taking full advantage of the advancements in technology.Daniel Um ’18, co-president of the Harvard College Electronic Music Collective, said that now DJs usually use softwares specifically programmed for DJs, like Serato or Traktor, instead of carrying around vinyls, and sometimes live performances include midi controllers like launchpads.
Many modern DJs are also producers—not only mixing pre-recorded music but also recording their original works. Um notes that the most well-known DJs make their own music. To take an example from Harvard’s own campus Tiesto, who is both a producer and a DJ, played at Yardfest this past spring.Furthermore, Um said that producing music gives him flexibility far beyond the 40s that people know, which is what he tends to play at college events.“Recently, in terms of production, I’ve been trying to play this new genre called ‘Tropical Trap.’ It’s basically like combining tropical house, because I’m from the Phillipines and I like tropical music, and then also trap music, because the percussion in trap music is really cool,” Um said. “So I’m taking the instruments and vibes in tropical music and adding the track and the bass and percussion, and writing these two together.”
What traditionally was a very technical craft with turntables has since evolved with accessible software to be a common hobby. In fact, many of Harvard’s own DJs said that they had no formal music education before they started mixing music.
For Timothy D. Haehl ’18, his interest in DJ’ing grew from his curiosity about finding new music and a locker room hobby on the football team.
“I used to make playlists every Friday night before a game,” Haehl said. “As a sophomore, especially, I would just put together music and share them with the other guys.”
Now, Haehl DJs for organizations on campus, from the FDO’s Silent at the Disco event to a Kappa Kappa Gamma formal. Though Haehl said that he’s been into electronic and dance music since his freshman year of high school, he’s never had formal music training.
“I’ve always wanted to produce music and I’ve played around with it a little bit,” he said. “I hate to say it, but I can’t read music and can’t play any instruments.”

But DJing at events doesn’t depend on sight reading skills or fluency in the language of music theory, unlike some other traditional forms of music. Luke A. Martinez ’19, a music concentrator who’s studied classical piano, guitar, bass, singing, and producing for years, recognizes the accessibility of DJing.
“Everyone can DJ, it’s not hard, per se, because it’s not like learning to play an instrument,” Martinez said. “Anyone can theoretically pick it up, which is cool, because it makes it more accessible.”
Linked loosely by their broad interest in music, DJs hail from a variety of informal trainings. Campus DJ Mati Carlos G. Reed ’19, for example, credits YouTube for getting him started after a summer internship for a San Antonio radio station.
The Harvard Electronic Music Collective provides lectures hosted by its students every other week, teaching interested students how to DJ. Irhad Sehovic ’18, co-president of the HCEMC, said that there is no experience required for students to attend these lectures or join the organization.
“Anyone can come and learn,” Sehovic said. “There’s no prior experience required.”
Even though it’s not difficult to get ahold of some equipment on campus and DJ as a hobby, some students at Harvard have actually turned DJing into a side business as well.
Alan Castro ’18 has been DJing for seven and half years now, yet he said he’s only recently turned DJing into more of a business. For Castro, DJing was an excuse to listen to music woven together at his home in high school—much louder, that is. What started as a simple hobby is now a way for Castro and other DJs to earn money on the side.

“I reach out to people to try to get bookings, I send invoices and receipts, and I’m more professional about it,” Castro said. “I just feel like I need to be, because that’s just what other DJs are doing, getting bookings. I don’t care about the money that much, but I want to stay in it and play for other people.”
Um said that he thinks the number of people who are putting themselves in the market for DJing events have grown since he’s been at Harvard.
“When I first got to Harvard, there weren’t a lot of DJs,” Um said. “Now there are generally enough to meet the demand for them.”
Reed has branded his DJing identity, and he’s known across campus as “DJ Matic.” He often plays for events held by student organizations at Harvard, both recognized and unrecognized. He’s played for the Eliot House formal and also at clubs in Boston.
DJs can also use their prices to send a message. Reed said that he DJs for events held by female organizations at half his normal pricing.
Some DJs say that through their experiences at campus events, they’ve come to recognize problems behind Harvard’s social life.
“I feel like one of the biggest problems with the social scene here on campus is just space,” Reed said. “We can’t really DJ in the houses, and we can’t really do it loudly in the SOCH. I know I personally got kicked out twice for noise complaints. It’s a space problem.”
Martinez agrees that space is an issue at Harvard, though for him, the problem was with the type of music that parties were playing and the spaces that he felt DJs were creating. The monotony of music across parties on campus is part of the problem.
“I hated everything that was being played, and I would just complain about it,” he said. “Can they play something that’s not played at every single party?”
Through his ethnomusicology studies at Harvard, Martinez said that he’s explored the history behind house music, which is what he DJs.
“The beginning of house music was to create a space for Black and Latino gay men,” Martinez said. “I realized that how a DJ could create a space and how much I wanted that much space and how much it was missing from where I’m from.”
Haehl points to Silent at the Disco, sponsored by the FDO and Harvard College, as an unique event that not only prompted collaboration, but also proved that college-sponsored events can be successful in providing party spaces. During the event, Haehl DJ’ed with Manu Gualandri ’20, playing tracks that the audience could switch between on their headphones.
Emily Koch ’20, one of the two organizers of the event, said that she was inspired to put on the event as an alternative to the traditional party at Harvard. She noted that music was a key component of almost all social events on campus.
“Music really sets the social scene,” she said.
After attending silent discos at music festivals, Koch said that she enjoyed how “the central thing was just the sound.” She pointed to how some social interactions can feel forced and conversations are often awkward, and that silent discos can be an escape from that for people to just enjoy the music.
“It changed the forced conversation,” Koch said. “You don’t have to talk to anyone—you can just put in your headphones and dance and do your own thing.” 
DJs on campus often wrestle with their individual styles and how to balance those styles with the demands of the audience at their public events. The party scene is a delicate balance between music that the DJs know will please the crowd and testing the crowd with new sounds. Because of the live and improvisational nature of DJing, the audience can help determine a DJ’s decisions in real time.
Um said that live music is not permanent—in fact, it’s “undead.” The audience and the DJ feed off of each other, and unlike in other programmed performances of music, DJs have the flexibility to improvise the act as they read the audience.
Sometimes, giving the audience what they’re comfortable with comes in conflict with the artistic expression of the individual DJ and their personal tastes. Castro said that his personal liking for techno music as well as Latino music isn’t what he would play for a gig. Hailing from southern Texas, Castro said that his home region is 96 to 97 percent Hispanic. Before coming to Harvard, he said that he didn’t embrace the music that he was surrounded by.
“I had to get out of Texas to realize I missed it,” he said. “So when I went back to Texas to DJ, I played a lot of Latino music, Black music, reggae music, all the likes, the music that I missed. But coming back here, what the kids wanted was top 40.”
At the same time, Castro said that the enjoyment of DJing comes from the crowd—when they’re having fun, he’s having more fun.
“I really enjoy playing music, and I think I’m fairly decent at mixing it, and when other people enjoy it as well, it doubles the enjoyment,” Castro said. “I’m having fun, and they’re having fun, and then I’m having fun because of that.”
Reed claims that his “style” is his take on the hottest hits of the day, sprinkled in with his personal top picks that he listens to in his free time.
“I kind of jump around everywhere,” Reed said. “Spanish, hip-hop, Caribbean, EDM, you name it.”
Meanwhile, Martinez’s main goal is in trying to push the crowd away from their familiar music, as his goal is not to please the crowd.
“I hate the idea of DJ as entertainer because I don’t think that’s their job,” he said. “It’s like their secondary position. But the DJ is a curator and a community leader, because people flock to a DJ because they want to hear a certain type of music. DJs are kind of what marry the world of music curation and music criticism to the world of popular entertainment, and they have to know both sides, because they’re the gap.”
Martinez said that he has no interest in becoming a famous DJ, despite the fact that he thinks the work of the DJ is inherently crowd-pleasing. Like Castro, Martinez feels rewarded when he gets positive feedback from the audience.
“I do want to make people happy, I love it when people come up to me and say, ‘You blew my mind,’ or something like that. That feels so good,” he said. “But the thing is I’m not just trying to be a crowd-pleaser. Introducing people to new music that they haven’t heard before, new emotions that they haven’t felt before, that’s what I want to do.”
Though the music that DJs mix at campus parties contributes actively to the social scene, the jockeys themselves are often alone at their performances, leading to a lack of close-knit culture amongst DJs at Harvard.
Castro said that he thinks of DJ as an isolated craft.
“You’re alone up there, you’re the one mixing the tracks together for the people, but you’re not part of the people,” he said.
At the same time, this isolation is part of what draws him into DJing. Castro said that as a self-proclaimed introvert, the role of the DJ is perfect for him in party spaces, allowing him to negotiate between performing within his personal comfort.
“I think DJing has been a way for me to express my craft and my love for this energy while at the same time stepping back a bit, but still creating that environment,” Castro said.
For Haehl, this isolation away from the crowd is exactly why he prefers not to DJ at Harvard. “I actually don’t love DJing at college events, because I know a lot of people and I want to hang out with them,” he said.
Amidst the lonely spot up on the stand, DJs reference the few collaborations that they do have as crucial to their DJ experiences. Reed said that the most he learned during any live DJ experience was when he DJ’ed with Cole Thompson ’18. He said that he practiced often with Thompson, which was a large part of getting into DJing.
To help bring this otherwise individual art form together and form a united culture, HCEMC is trying to create a network of DJs who can find other DJs to collaborate. Um said that HCEMC is working on a more centralized system for DJs, including mailing lists and group messages on social media sites to pass along gigs.
Another night, another round of parties. Rooms are filled, bodies pressed up against one another, and music blasts from the speakers, woven seamlessly together by DJs. One at a time, these DJs are spinning discs and turning the tables of these musical spaces.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“‘Masseduction’ is different, it's pretty first person,” wrote Annie Clark, better known by her stage name, St. Vincent, about her fifth album in a press release. “You can't fact-check it, but if you want to know about my life, listen to this record.” That is certainly a bold claim, but the album does not spare details, whether they be in the lyrics, the backgrounds, or the samples.
Clark weaves fascinating synth-pop beats and vocal acrobatics into a musical potpourri that acts as a sonic backdrop for her to come to grips with anger, loneliness, drug use, fame, and grief. Although some of the tracks seem repetitive at times, and some of her lyrics border on cliché, there is enough subtlety and variation, thematically and musically, to keep the work engaging throughout the album’s 42-minute duration. Similar in many ways to St. Vincent’s previous delightfully eccentric and unusual forays into pop, “Masseduction” still manages to improve upon Clark’s previous successes by incorporating raw, deeper lyrics and new sounds into an expressive and thoughtfully articulate album.
“Masseduction” opens with “Hang On Me,” a synth-inspired track on which Clark sings, “You and me / Weren’t meant for this world” over electronic modulations and a violin sample. There is no bang, no exciting intro—this track leaves out much of the theatrics of the rest of the album, perhaps a somber reflection on what it means to be an artist with the eccentricities Clark has.
The second track on the album, the single “Pills,” blends pop refrains, hip-hop beats from producer Sounwave, and electronic interludes for a chorus that sounds like something out of a 1960s commercial jingle (“Pills to wake, pills to sleep / Pills, pills, pills every day of the week”). Yet, about halfway through the song, she switches to a gloomy, glam-pop sound as she sings, “Come all you wasted, wretched, and scorned / Come on and face it, come join the war,” as if inviting the listener to relish in the album’s quirks and surprises. If “Hang On Me” subtly introduces the album’s themes, “Pills” makes them explicit.
“Los Ageless” opens with a beat vaguely resembling something out of an LCD Soundsystem album, but quickly transitions to glamorous synth-pop as she sings, “How could anyone have you and lose you / And not lose their minds too.” For all the glamorous sounds, dramatic vocals, and big hooks on this track, like many others in this album, themes of love and loss still percolate to the surface.
Clark intersperses the upbeat, synth music on the album with sad nostalgia and emotional lyricism. In “Happy Birthday Jonny,” perhaps one of the most personal tracks on the album, Clark recalls an ex-lover over a solemn piano chord progression. Yet the piece is about moving on, and coming to grips with loss. Likewise, two tracks later in “New York,” Clark appears to return to longing sounds and nostalgic lyrics (“I have a lost a hero / I have lost a friend / But for you darling / I’d do it all again”).
The album concludes with “Slow Dance” and “Smoking Section.” “Slow Dance” has a violin-infused melody and lyrics that contemplate running to and fro in the modern world (“Am I thinking what everybody’s thinking / That I’m so glad I came, but I can’t wait to leave?”). Clark juxtaposes slowed tempo, and, as the lyrics suggest, a disco-esque background, with lyrics about hurriedness, about restlessness and anxiety about getting from point A to point B. In “Smoking Section,” Clark concludes the album with a reflective outro, singing, “Let it happen, let it happen, let it happen,” à la Kevin Parker, but also noting that “it’s not the end,” a fitting way to cap off an album about journeys not yet begun or finished.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the 90s, Wu-Tang Clan has influenced and developed hip-hop culture by being among the first superstar artists to rap about controversial issues. Wu-Tang Clan set the stage for the integration of conscious and gangster rap when their debut album “Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)” shook the genre in 1993 with its strong hooks and bars. That album was the essence of that time period, ensuring their status as one of the greatest rap groups. Since then, Wu-Tang Clan has mostly sustained their brilliant work, although their albums since “36 Chambers” have not had the same impact. They certainly looked to break this trend with “The Saga Continues,” their long-awaited seventh album, which dropped on Oct. 13.
In an era in which most of the genre since the debut of “36 Chambers” has turned to girls, drugs, and money, rather than arguments of substance, it’s exciting to see where there is meaning behind lyrics.
In 2017, the rap scene is less about specific lyrics and rhymes and more about how the songs impact our current culture. Rappers like the infamous Lil Pump didn’t get famous because he’s a good rapper with strong lyrics. Instead, he got on social media and created a ridiculous catch phrase that people start saying when they are under an influence on a Saturday night.
Obviously, Wu-Tang Clan is not impressed with this current wave of new school rap. In many ways, “The Saga Continues” reminds us of what was and what should be. Of course it makes sense that rap is going to change stylistically, but just because something changes doesn’t mean it must lose its original intentions.
The album opens with the statement, “It’s the 21st century and we’ve still got to dodge the motherf***ing coppers.” Within seconds the group is able to call out what is wrong with society in a creative and poetic way. Wu-Tang Clan shows their wisdom and experience through this one line: They are able to demonstrate how long they’ve been in the rap and hip-hop scene and witnessing the injustices happening to black people in America. With the country’s president embroiled in racial controversy, it’s beyond refreshing to hear RZA say, “If I put my fist through the face of a racist / Smack 'em tasteless / Would I face three cases in court, locked in places / Or shackled to a seat of a bus, a hundred of us / Life in America shouldn't be so tough.”
While the album is able to touch on multiple points that are what some might call “woke,” such as police brutality and racism, there’s a problem—Wu-Tang Clan has the same sound that they did in 1993, but the genre has changed. While the album is strong in lyricism and message, the listener in 2017 demands more creative production and memorable choruses. In a day and age in which production and beats mean so much, a simple beat won’t cut it unless the lyrics are absolutely phenomenal.
An album released in late 2017 should not sound like it came out the same time as “Ready to Die” by Notorious B.I.G. It might seem hypocritical to ask the Wu-Tang Clan to be more modern while criticizing the majority of new school rap, but they don’t need to change what they are trying to say, just how they say it: Artists like Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, J. Cole, and Kanye West rap about similar material but push musical boundaries at the same time. “The Saga Continues” has four skits, a trope that has been outdated on rap albums since the early 2000s. Today’s rap albums include interludes and reprises, which provide a modern update to skits by featuring musical content as well as conceptual ideas, but Wu-Tang Clan stubbornly sticks to skits.
Wu-Tang Clan’s new album has a star-studded crew, good features, and a fantastic message, but it will never be something great—it will never fully impact society in the way the group might hope it would. The point of “The Sage Continues” might be more about the message than the music, but we are in a society and rap culture that focus on sound. If a group wants to get their message across, they have to use both.

The inspiration for David Carlson and Landis Blair’s graphic novel, “The Hunting Accident: A True Story of Crime and Poetry” came during a conversation over breakfast at a diner. Carlson reveals in the book’s afterword how his “eggs grew cold” as his friend Charlie Rizzo told him the story of his father, Matt, a man who lost his vision during an armed robbery with his friends and subsequently fell in love with literature while in prison.
Carlson’s story begins with Charlie, a young adolescent caught between two worlds: that of his father, and that of his friends. On the one hand, Charlie’s father, who his son believes was blinded in a hunting accident, pushes Charlie to tap dance and practice cello. Charlie also takes on the role of his father’s defender, chastising strangers who stare and cashiers who cheat him of his change. On the other hand, Charlie succumbs to the wayward influences of his friends, a group of juvenile delinquents who wreak havoc in Chicago’s Little Italy. When Charlie gets into trouble, his father tells him that he, too, fell in with the wrong crowd as a teenager, lost his sight, and wound up in prison—there was no real hunting accident, after all.
“The Hunting Accident” is, above all, a story about getting lost in other people’s stories. Charlie loses himself in the vivid story of his father Matt’s time behind bars, the way Matt loses himself in great works of literature, like Dante’s “The Divine Comedy” and Plato’s metaphor of the cave, or the way Matt’s cellmate loses himself in Matt’s stories of traveling around the country as a “hobo.” This is particularly fitting because the graphic novel itself is spellbinding, with its beautifully imaginative illustrations, delicate literary allusions, and intimate insights into father-son relationships.
Blair presents a complex and wonderfully creative reading of Carlson’s story. Illustrations in “The Hunting Accident” go far beyond the standard rectangular panels popular in comic books and graphic novels. Some panels float in the foreground of a larger image. At times, frightening figures reminiscent of No Face in the Hayao Miyazaki’s film “Spirited Away” and spiraling representations of different sounds pop out. Sometimes the figure will hold a corner of the panel in its hand as if it were a framed painting, rather than part of the story. The smoke oozing out of a cigarette expands into a speech bubble that takes up three-quarters of a page. Three pages of cross-hatched lines illustrate the moment after Matt is shot in the face and blinded, followed by another page of cross-hatched blackness, this time with speech bubbles that stem from the empty panels filled with darkness. Excerpts from Matt’s novel are written on pages designed to be distinctive, in which all text is handwritten in a different font and Matt and Charlie are drawn as black silhouettes against a background of braille, most likely a reference to Plato’s Cave, an allegory important to the rest of the story.
Carlson gracefully incorporates literature and a little history into his narrative. He weaves Dante, Plato, and Nietzsche's stories with Matt’s own, providing greater insight into his “story of crime and poetry,” but also into the literary works themselves. Some chapters have names like “The Inferno,” “Purgatorio,” and “Paradiso,” along with “Plato’s Cave” and “The Übermensch.” Carlson’s use of literature is perhaps more heavy handed—he designs the prison as a “panopticon,” a structure composed of rings. The prison has nine rings, like the nine rings of Hell in Dante’s “Inferno,” with prisoners assigned to each floor based on the severity of their sins and crimes.
“The Hunting Accident” illuminates multiple father-son relationships: Matt and Charlie, Matt and his father, and even Matt’s cellmate (the infamous child killer, Nathan Leopold) and his father. “The Hunting Accident” is initially about parenting errors—from Leopold’s own emotionally abusive relationship with his dad to Matt’s decision to lie to Charlie and his mother—but ends with Charlie working hard to preserve his father’s memory after recognizing that he, too, felt the urge to spend time with the gangs of Little Italy. The book ultimately shines a light on the warm and loving aspects of the father-son relationship in a way that doesn’t feel corny, but well-earned.

“Next Customer Please,” an original play by Boyd I.R. Hampton ’16, served up some laughs as promised—nothing less, nothing more.
The light comedy, which ran Oct. 12 to Oct. 15 in the Agassiz Theater, centered around the fast-paced banter and farcical staging of the day-to-day interactions of several dramatic, talkative retail employees. The actors performed their quirky roles with enthusiasm; the minimalist set with colorful clothes hanging on the white walls and folded in piles looked convincingly like a ready-to-use Old Navy; and many of the play’s outlandish one-liners were amusing. “We work at a store that is often compared to a clearance bin at Walmart,” store manager Derek (Julius Wade ’20) says wryly. Like a grab-bag Walmart bin, this show wasn’t infused with gravitas or interested in weighty issues or existential crises, nor was the production intended to be.
The actors dealt well with the bizarre situations that the script contrived. At one point in the play, a customer tries to strangle Joah (Bobby Malley ’20), one of the employees, with a scarf. At another point, Derek cleans up feces from a dressing room, not a rare occurrence in the fictional store, called The Break. Set apart as color-lit flashbacks and interspersed infrequently between scenes of employees interacting, these employee-customer vignettes were outrageous, unrealistic, and, in the case of the poop pickup, sometimes came across as lowbrow and uncomfortably weird. But it’s all in a day’s work, and the cast clearly enjoyed working together to bring the story to life. Wade, in particular, succeeded in crafting Derek’s personality: crazy-eyed, anxious, slightly nefarious, but with a heart of gold underneath.
In this way, the show’s weaknesses—vague plot development and a rushed ending—were likely a product of the script, not weaknesses on the part of the production’s give-it-their-all actors or the smart blocking choices by Director Carla Troconis ’19, which made use of both the Agassiz’s elevated stage and the space in front of the platform. Despite many funny one-liners, the storyline didn’t proceed very smoothly.
In bare-bones terms, a very pregnant and no-nonsense boss, Pam (Mimi Alphonsus ’21), arrives at The Break to tell Derek that he will have to fire one of the employees, but Pam ultimately fires Derek, although the show takes a long time to get there. And, for all of Derek’s former chutzpah and the show’s admirable dedication to humorous and fast-witted dialogue, this ending felt underwhelming, uncharacteristically mellow, and out of place. The cast ultimately succeeded in their commitment to delivering the production’s farcical elements, but the show itself struggled to hang together structurally.

Book signings by Nobel Prize-winning authors tend to be popular events in Cambridge, and this event was no exception. On Sept. 25, Orhan Pamuk, the Nobel Prize-winning Turkish author, visited the First Parish Church in Cambridge for a talk and book-signing session. The talk, hosted by Maria Tatar, the John L. Loeb Professor of Germanic Languages and Literatures and of Folklore and Mythology at Harvard University, revolved around Pamuk’s new book, “The Red-Haired Woman.”
Pamuk began by introducing the book, which centers around an older man remembering his teenage years in the early 1980s in Turkey. The novel follows the boy’s struggles with his father, and his relationship with his family. Pamuk read portions of the book while attempting what he called a “Dickensian” habit of imitating the voices of his characters. Pamuk described the work, which at 272 pages is one of Pamuk’s shorter works, as “realist” and a book “about storytelling—theater and performance play an important role.”
Much of the conversation focused on the inspiration for Pamuk’s book. Pamuk noted that he was partially inspired by an interaction he had with two workers, an older man and a younger boy, digging a well in a plot of land next to his house in the summer of 1988, when he was finishing his fourth work, “The Black Book.” Pamuk described his observations of the older man’s treatment of the younger boy: During the day, according to the author, the older man was very strict and disciplinary, but at night, the man was very friendly and casual with the boy.
Pamuk recalled that he would interact with the two men, whom he later found out were father and son, on a daily basis, providing water and holding casual conversations with the two. Pamuk noted that he drew on this experience, as well as the Turkish fable, “Rustum and Sohrab,” a Turkish epic that centers around a fight between a father and a son, to develop “The Red Haired Woman.” When asked why the motif of the well resonated so deeply, Pamuk drew parallels from the story of Joseph, the Biblical story about a boy who makes his brothers jealous by receiving preferential treatment from his father. More broadly, however, Pamuk noted that the story is about water: “The story says that if you find water in the land, you will find the most important thing.”
Yet Pamuk characterized his approach to storytelling as a way of talking about issues of identity and place. While discussing the motif of the well, he added, “Why did I write a novel about the well? Well, in the Middle East, there was no civilization before the well. The well is a source of life and happiness.” Pamuk compared the tension between father and son in “The Red-Haired Woman” more generally with the tension between Eastern and Western canons in his works. Comparing Sophocles’ “Oedipus Rex” with the fable of “Rustum and Sohrab,” Pamuk noted that most in Istanbul would be able to recognize the latter story, but might not be able to identify the characters or the specific plot details as with the former tale, a phenomenon Pamuk attributed to Turkish Westernization.
Finally, Pamuk concluded with some thoughts about his writing process. When asked about how he begins writing novels, Pamuk said, “A book relies on inventiveness, creativity on many levels. You get 20 to 30 good ideas during a year, and write about maybe five of them.”
At the end of the event, a line formed around the inside of the church for the book signing. Cambridge resident Joan Dunfey commented, “He’s a really philosophical writer and a wonderful craftsman. He taps into myth or archetypal stories which is unusual, and I greatly enjoyed seeing him speak this evening.”
Michael Rodriguez, a Cambridge resident, commented, “I had never read Pamuk’s book before—his talk was incredibly refined and articulate, and it certainly made me want to read his books.”
Fans familiar with Pamuk also agreed. Ayfer Jory, a Cambridge resident, noted, “It was great: I have both Turkish and English copies [of Pamuk’s works], and reading the books in both languages did not change my understanding, which just shows how true to the original meaning the translators make the works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We have all been recipients of “that” email: a brief, painstakingly polite message thanking us for our dedication (as far as dedication can be demonstrated through a brief written application) and notifying us that, most unfortunately, there simply isn’t space for us. And more often than not, these rejection emails come from our peers, the same people we sit next to in section and bump into in dining halls.
Indeed, along with Expos 20 and Life Sciences 1a, freshman year also seems to offer students an excellent Rejection 10a course in how to handle being cut from clubs. Students go from being the proverbial big fish in a small pond to members of entire school (both literally and metaphorically) of big fish. We don’t always know how to handle a “no”, when we have based so much of our self-worth off of external achievement, a rejection feels like either a heartbreak or a mistake.
Conversations circle back again and again to critiques of Harvard comp culture. At Peer Advising Fellows training over the summer, we discussed strategies for coaching our advisees through rejection. The Undergraduate Council recently introduced a Q Guide for comps to help new students study up on which comps have cuts, which take the most amount of time, and which select based on merit.
Yet few suggested that comps be fundamentally reformed. The classic Harvard answer as to why comps exists is that there’s simply no other way. And it’s hard to argue with this. Harvard students don’t sign up for one club, they sign up for twenty, thus forcing organizations to make cuts simply to have a manageable number of people. It’s a cycle quite similar to college admissions, where acceptance rates go down, causing students to apply to yet more groups, thus further dropping the acceptance rate.
The solution then becomes, rather than doing away with competition, flipping the scripts on how we mentally approach comps and application processes. Entering freshman year, many students hate even the thought of rejection, having just fought their way through college application season. Rejection in this context feels like a statement that you simply aren’t “good” enough—you haven’t studied hard enough, done enough extracurriculars, written a strong enough essay. Freshmen enter Harvard with almost a formula for success in mind: If we simply have racked up enough achievements in high school, we should get what we want.
At Harvard, students need to learn that rejection stems from and symbolizes something entirely different. Even the most objective comp cannot avoid a heavy degree of subjectivity and bias. Every organization comes with its own culture, its own idea of what the “right” type of person is. Comps look less at an applicant’s past accomplishments than their future potential to flourish in that organization. Rejection is thus less a reflection of an applicant’s personal shortcomings and more that they may simply not be the right fit in the eyes of upperclassmen.
Merit of course still plays a role—despite my love of a capella, my tone deafness may preclude me from membership in the Opportunes—but I urge students, especially freshmen, to bear in mind that many rejections are made at the margins. Decisions are often necessarily arbitrary. With so many qualified applicants, deliberations often end up fixating on questions like, “Will this person be invested in our organization? Will they fit with our community?”
So as much as comp processes carry the inevitable sting of rejection and anxiety, we should not allow them to define our worth or the future contributions we will make to campus. Instead, we ought to look at them as an effective, albeit painful, way of navigating Harvard’s overwhelming buffet of extracurricular options. It takes time and Doodle polls and awkward interviews, but in my experience, students eventually are able to discover the communities and opportunities that fit not just their resumes, but also their passions.

I don’t really remember what I did on Oct. 11, 2015. It was a Sunday, so I probably went to church with my family, ate a late lunch, and started my homework. It was also my senior fall, so I probably worked on college applications. One thing I know for sure is that I did not come out to anyone.
I was aware that it was National Coming Out Day. But at the time, the idea of coming out felt unattainable. Sure, I was excited to read about other people’s coming out experiences, but I couldn’t envision myself as one of them. I kept telling myself that they had some mixture of courage and confidence that I lacked. How could I possibly be part of their community if I couldn’t take the risk they took and live honestly? Was I really queer if practically no one knew?
For some LGBTQ+ people, National Coming Out Day is an opportunity to open up to the world about their authentic selves. As the name suggests, many people do indeed come out, either for the first time or the hundredth time. It can also be a day to celebrate how far our community has come in our fight for equality, and to look ahead to the work we still need to do. It’s a chance to raise awareness about LGBTQ+ issues, as this might be one of the few times a year that cis straight people remember we exist. Many National Coming Out Day events are public and loud, a way for us to take up space in places where we’ve historically and presently been told that we don’t belong.
All of this increases visibility for our community and brings us closer to full equality and acceptance, and I’m thankful that so many people do participate. But we can’t forget that these events are completely optional. Moreover, for some people, participation is not an option. An overemphasis on coming out can feel quite othering for those who can’t or don’t want to come out, whatever their reasons. National Coming Out Day is one of the most well-known LGBTQ+ holidays, but it’s typically centered around just one potential aspect of the queer experience. We have to keep in mind that there are other equally valid ways to be queer, and coming out doesn’t need to be a part of it.
National Coming Out Day is also frequently framed as a celebration, which is great because most negative media coverage can lead people to believe that every LGBTQ+ person is miserable. I love turning that narrative upside down and reminding everyone that queer people can be happy because they’re queer, not in spite of it. Queerness is not an inherently bad thing; it’s queerphobia that makes life harder for LGBTQ+ people. But, I also recognize that coming out and the general experience of queerness is not always the most positive experience. For some of us, coming out is incredibly challenging and calls for somber reflection, not party music and rainbows. Many have lost their jobs, their families, and even their lives after coming out. We should hold space for those experiences, too.
National Coming Out Day should be a day for all LGBTQ+ people, regardless of whether they shout their queerness from the rooftops or haven’t come out to anyone other than themselves, whether they wear a rainbow cape all day or do nothing special. While I now openly celebrate National Coming Out Day, my queerness does not depend on that. And I’ve come to realize that there are many other ways that I embrace my queerness beyond coming out on a particular day.
I embrace my queerness every Thursday night when I host Queer Movie Night with some of my close queer friends.
I embrace my queerness every time I look up at the “Love is love” poster hanging on my wall, reminding me of how hard my community fought to guarantee my right to marry whomever I want.
I embrace my queerness every time I drink from the mug my sister bought me as a gag gift which says, “World’s Okayest Sister.” I always misread it as “World’s Gayest Sister.” It’s displayed on my shelf as a daily reminder that I have a sister who loves and accepts me just as I am, even if I was the world’s gayest sister.
I embrace my queerness every time I walk to class with two rainbow pins on my backpack—they make me feel invincible yet still a little vulnerable.
I embrace my queerness every time I use my column to call attention to injustices the LGBTQ+ community faces.
I embrace my queerness every time I open my closet and see my bag of rainbow paraphernalia from Pride. When my parents came to visit, I stashed it away in a friend’s dorm. Every time I look at the bag, I remember how lucky I am to feel comfortable being out at school.
I embrace my queerness every time I cultivate friendships with other queer people—I’m currently texting a lesbian friend about the merits of Cameron Esposito’s side mullet.
I embrace my queerness every time I get involved with LGBTQ+ life on campus, whether it’s through interning at the BGLTQ Office or peer counseling for Contact.
But even more importantly, I embrace my queerness every day by just being me. And that’s what National Coming Out Day should be about: embracing your queerness in any way that feels best to you, whether you come out or not.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this week, the College Events Board announced that it would no longer be funding the “Haunted Hall” Halloween party, a campus-wide event the past two years. While the CEB typically partners with the First-Year Social Committee to plan the event, this year, without the collaboration of the CEB, the “Haunted Hall” will be open only to first-year students. Though it is unfortunate to see one fewer Harvard-wide, socially inclusive event, this move is a reasonable one.
For one, opening up the “Haunted Hall” party to upperclassmen is apparently quite expensive—three times more than a first-year-only party, according to an FYSC fellow. Though there are no statistics on attendance, as an alcohol-free party hosted in Annenberg Hall, “Haunted Hall” appears unlikely to compete with upperclassmen parties. Given the party’s low likelihood of attracting upperclassmen, it would be wasteful to spend three times as much money to accommodate them.
Moreover, “Haunted Hall” likely means more to first-year students than upperclassmen as they begin to navigate the college social scene. As one of the first major party weekends in the semester, Hallo-weekend can be a trying time for first-years unadjusted to college parties. “Haunted Hall” can function as a well-funded, well-regulated (non-alcoholic) destination for first-years who might otherwise seek non-Harvard-hosted social events.
On the other hand, upperclassmen are veterans of the Hallo-weekend ruckus, and they have the advantage of their own House Committees. Many HoCos will host their own Hallo-weekend parties for their House residents this year, so the upperclassmen really are not missing much without the usual “Haunted Hall.”
It is important to note, however, that although it seems reasonable for the CEB to forgo responsibility in this instance, this is by no means an excuse for Harvard to abandon its commitment in hosting inclusive Harvard social events. The announcement of this decision comes at an inopportune institutional moment; after the proposed ban on unrecognized single-gender social organizations, Harvard’s dedication to an inclusive social atmosphere is more important now than ever. Giving up funding for “Haunted Hall” does not mean the College should defund other campus-wide parties.
Instead, this decision should motivate the University to consider other events they could host. In fact, now that the CEB is saving $24,000 on “Haunted Hall,” they should have some extra funds for other campus parties. It is also important for Harvard to realize how this decision will affect the HoCos; by shifting financial responsibility to the individual houses, Harvard is effectively reducing the HoCos budget by unexpectedly forcing them to spend extra money.  The University must be wary of this unfortunate consequence and should consider granting subsidies.
In the end, we will miss the cheesy decor, questionable costumes, and uniquely Annenberg-ian glamour of the campus-wide “Haunted Hall” tradition. But, hopefully, there will be many more events to fill its place.

Former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy ’98 and former executive director of Doctors for America Alice Chen addressed the adverse medical effects of loneliness at an event sponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School Center for Public Leadership on Monday.
The event expanded on Murthy’s recent article “Work and the Loneliness Epidemic” in the Harvard Business Review, as well as Murthy and Chen’s work in developing positive workplace culture in their organizations. In that article, Murthy argues that business should strive to reduce reduce loneliness and foster connections among their employees.
At the event, Murthy emphasized the biological need for human connection and said that chronic loneliness can reduce lifespan as much as chronic smoking.
“When we are not connected with others, it actually puts us into a physiological stress state,” he said. “It can lead to higher levels of inflammation, which can damage tissues and blood vessels, and increase incidents of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and a range of other illnesses.”
Beyond the physical effects of loneliness, Murthy also emphasized the importance of tackling loneliness in the workplace because of its emotional complexity among diverse groups of people.
“How do we even define loneliness? Not by having a specific number of friends,” he said. “I could have 1,000 friends and feel lonely; our world is built from people who have 1,000 Facebook friends, 1,000 Twitter followers, and feel lonely.”
At the Surgeon General’s Office, Murthy began a weekly practice called “Inside Scoop” where team members had five minutes each to share meaningful photographs from their life.
“People have a desire to be known, and to be known authentically as whole people—not just as John Doe who’s really good at quantitative analysis,” he said. “[Inside Scoop] changed how they interacted with each other.”
Chen also said coworkers should discuss love more in everyday conversation.
“Love is one of those things that people need permission to talk about, but it’s so important to all of us. It’s almost like a social norm that needs to be shifted,” she said.
Murthy agreed with Chen, adding that between the “two driving forces”—love and fear— he believed people naturally prefer a workplace centered around love.
“I can’t think of anyone who would want their son or their daughter to be fearful all the time when they go to work and make a decision,” he said. “But that is what will happen if we don’t stand up for, speak up for, and model the value of love.”
Megan J. Townsend, a graduate student studying at the Kennedy School and Medical School, said that Murthy and Chen’s discussion resonated with her personally.
“The issue of depression and loneliness among medical students and graduate students is hugely underestimated, and it was so refreshing to hear the language that they used in talking about loneliness,” Townsend said.
Administrators at the Medical School have instituted a number of reforms in recent years to open up conversations about mental health and vulnerability. In a March 2016 survey, 20 percent of third-year Medical School respondents said they had experienced suicidal or self-harming desires within the past two weeks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Amid a College crackdown on off-campus social clubs, the Office of Student Life allocated $5,000—part of a larger sum given by University President Drew G. Faust to the OSL—to fund College-wide social events in the Houses.
The House Committees have used the new funding to create a grant system for parties open to all undergraduates. The House Committees will be allocated another $5,000 for the spring term, according to OSL Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller.
“Most of the money President Faust has given us is going right back into the hands of students,” Miller said.
In recent weeks, Leverett, Lowell, and Pforzheimer Houses have each hosted their own parties, open to all undergraduates and free of charge.
Juliana Rodriguez ’19, a co-chair of Lowell’s House Committee, said that the HoCos play an important role in hosting social events that are open to all undergraduates at Harvard. Lowell held a neon rave-themed party—deemed "GLowell"—at its temporary home in the Inn Saturday.
“We play a really key role in re-centering student life in the Houses,” Rodriguez said. “We have the energy and the resources to be throwing big parties and so we just wanted to really push ourselves to be there for our peers.”
Pforzheimer HoCo hosted a “Decades Dance” on Saturday, which played music from the '80s, '90s, and 2000s and attracted roughly 200 people, according to Pforzheimer HoCo co-chair Mo Kim ’18.
Kim said parties organized by House Committees serve a demand for a specific kind of social interaction—one that is not offered by other organizations such as final clubs, Greek organizations, and student groups.
“Where I find myself with HoCo a lot of times is just kind of in the middle of many competing expectations, many ideas about what social life is and how to best serve...these competing needs,” Kim said.
The recent funding for student life from Faust comes after a similar allocation in 2015 for College-wide social events and amid broader discussions over campus social life. That sum funded a “Blank” Party and a College-wide Halloween party, both of which were free.
In September, a committee released a report recommending several options to attempt to curtail membership in unrecognized social groups in a bid to reshape social life at the College. Faust will weigh in on which of the proposed paths to pursue before she departs the presidency next year.

CORRECTION: October 17, 2017 
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that the Office of Student Life had created a grant program to incentivize open parties. In fact, House Committee created the grant program.

Students seeking an alternative to Annenberg can regularly find food trucks peddling cod, pizza, falafel, and tacos in the Science Center Plaza. Notably absent, however, is a favorite vendor from previous semesters: Chicken and Rice Guys.
Chicken and Rice Guys’ food trucks have been off the road since April, according to the popular halal restaurant’s CEO and co-founder Ian So. In that time frame, the company missed the opportunity to apply for Harvard Common Spaces food truck program at the Science Center Plaza.
After an E. coli outbreak linked to Chicken and Rice Guys temporarily shuttered the Boston-based restaurant’s shops and food trucks this spring, the restaurant has been working to get back on its feet.
Harvard Campus Services spokesperson Michael D. Conner wrote in an email that because the trucks were not operational during the application window for this semester, they were removed from consideration.
“The safety of our students, faculty, and staff is, and will remain, a top priority,” Conner wrote. “We maintain a good relationship with Chicken and Rice Guys and will certainly invite them to apply for the program this coming spring.”
So said that trucks have started servicing other locations again for the first time in the past few weeks, and that they look forward to returning to Harvard in the future.
“We were off the road longer than we had expected, and Harvard had expected, but we’re back now and we would like to vend at Harvard and I think there are some windows to come back and vend,” he said.
Some students are eagerly awaiting the return of their favorite campus food option, which used to visit the plaza three times per week.
Peter M. Bearse ’19, who said he frequented Chicken and Rice Guys at least once—and sometimes multiple times—per week, said he was eager for the truck to return.
“No offense to the other trucks, but no truck draws that level of crowd size as Chicken and Rice Guys, and it’s for a reason, because it’s so good,” he said. “Knowing that they will be back and they didn’t just get a hard no is a big relief.”
Arin L. Stowman ’19 said she was similarly dismayed to find Chicken and Rice Guys absent from the food truck selection. She said she used to eat at the truck for lunch each Friday, and has been trying to find a way to go to their Boston location in the truck’s absence.
“The main thing is that it’s simple: it’s chicken and rice, some vegetables thrown in there, but when you add the sauce, it takes it to a whole other level,” she said. “I think it’s a good flavor that they have going on. It’s just kind of unattainable anywhere else here on campus.”
Bearse said he has been going to Chicken & Rice Guys’ Allston storefront every few weekends to get his favorite grub, but that it is no match for having the convenience of his favorite truck right at school.
“The thing is, Chicken & Rice Guys is a place you go because you want to go. I feel like sometimes the other trucks, you eat there because you have to, you’re in a rush, or something like that,” Bearse said. “I go to the brick-and-mortar Chicken & Rice Guys stores now—it’s the only way I can get it.”
Stowman said she was excited for the truck to hopefully return in the spring, and that she was not worried about E. coli.
“I feel like after you find that and you take the necessary measures, they’re obviously going to be cleaner now than they were before. I was never really affected even though I went pretty often,” she said. “It shouldn’t happen, but it does, it’s just something to live with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 17, 2017 at 12:04 a.m.
University presidents and athletics administrators addressed a range of issues facing collegiate athletics at a panel discussion Thursday, discussing amateurism, coaching and staff diversity, and several scandals that have dogged athletics programs in recent years.
Moderated by Education School professor James Soto Antony, the panel featured the head of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, presidents of two universities, and the executive director of the Ivy League.
Panelists were quick to assert that athletic programs build camaraderie and community among students, and also benefit student-athletes themselves.
“People are off going in their different directions, and athletics really does pull a big decentralized research university together in a way that nothing else does,” said Susan Herbst, president of the University of Connecticut. “It draws the world to your university and markets it in a way you never could.”
Robin Harris, executive director of the Ivy League, said she believes college athletics programs are an unparalleled source of life lessons for student-athletes, teaching students “[to bounce] back from defeat and adversity, teamwork, communication, the business skills, leadership skills.”
Panelists also outlined the challenges athletics programs can bring to students and universities. In recent years, athletics scandals have rocked colleges across the nation.
This month, the FBI charged multiple people with bribery in college basketball. And last fall, the Harvard men’s soccer team was among several college teams to have its season cancelled after administrators discovered the team had circulated sexually explicit material about the women's soccer recruits.
NCAA President Mark Emmert said he is confident that the NCAA can address the challenges college athletic programs faces, though he recognized a need for reform.
“Does the NCAA have a structure right now that they can hold each other accountable for behavior that is essential to having collegiate athletics be successful? I’m confident that the answer to that is yes, but I’m also confident that we’ve got to make some very fundamental changes,” said Emmert.
Panelists also discussed the issue of amateurism in college athletics. All agreed that student-athletes should not be paid, but that they should receive enough financial support to ensure they can succeed athletically and academically.
“When college athletics is done right, the issue doesn't even come up, whether they are amateur or employees, because… you’re treating them as students who are in a co-curricular endeavor that happens to involve athletic competition,” said Harris.
Chris Howard, president of Robert Morris University, spoke about the need for athletic programs need to actively seek racial diversity when hiring for coaches and directors.
“You should take some of that money, and there’s a lot of money there, and put it into diversity efforts,” said Howard. “[We] have to take a deliberate, proper step, just like with Title IX… to change that.”
Harvard is currently conducting a review of how it pays its coaches after a complaint from the women’s rugby team alleged “unequal treatment” of men’s and women’s programs. According to Department of Education statistics, head coaches of Harvard’s women’s teams were paid roughly $34,000 less than head coaches of men’s teams in the 2015-2016 school year.
Harris said that the Ivy League “[doesn’t] get involved” in gender-bias accusations and that it leaves compensation decisions up to individual colleges. She also said she “[hasn’t] heard anything” about these allegations.
“Obviously I believe there should be no discrimination in how pay is set, but there’s a lot of factors that go into how pay is set,” she said.

Sixty-three groups of students submitted applications to establish new clubs, commencing the first cycle where the power to approve new campus organizations will principally rest in the hands of students, according to Associate Dean for Student Engagement Alexander R. Miller.
The Undergraduate Council will review proposals the new student groups in November and a majority vote of the full body will be required for approval, a significant departure from prior procedures. The approved clubs will hold a provisional status for one year followed by a subsequent UC review for full recognition.
In February, the College’s Office of Student Life declined to accept new applications for student groups, seeking to stem the proliferation of student organizations on campus and to increase student involvement in the approval process. The Committee on Student Life, a student-faculty committee charged with official recognition powers over campus clubs, delegated the bulk of recognition powers to the UC in March.
Now, the Committee on Student Life will “rubber-stamp” the UC’s recommendation for provisional approval, according to Miller. Though a handful of undergraduates serve on the Committee on Student Life, the new process will be the first time College students seeking to form new clubs will be evaluated by their peers.
Miller said that the multi-step process will begin in the coming weeks. Prospective club leaders will meet with staff from College offices that advise student groups with similar activities—new a capella groups would meet with the Office for the Arts, for instance.
“These students will begin to meet with campus partners who are looked at as essentially content experts,” Miller added.
Following a preliminary evaluation by College offices, the applicants will be forwarded on to the Rules Committee of the Undergraduate Council.
The College currently recognizes 437 independent student organizations, according to Miller. Though the Office of Student Life placed over 50 clubs on probation for failing to complete mandatory registration requirements, many of the student groups regained their recognition status following additional training.
In 2016, the Committee on Student Life approved 31 of the 38 applications for new clubs under the old process.

Presidential search committee member Lawrence H. Bacow told a group of Latino alumni and student group leaders at a meeting Friday that the committee is still gathering input for the search and has not developed a list of candidates.
“At this point they’re in the data collection phase of it. They’re going to get to the point where they’re going to narrow down a list,” Shirley V. Cardona, president of the HBS Latino Alumni Association, said.
Cardona, who organized the meeting, said Bacow did not specify when the 15-member search committee expects to formally develop a list of candidates. Susan L. Graham ’64, a member of the search committee, said last month that the search remains in “information-gathering mode.”
Cardona, another member of the Harvard Business School Latino Alumni Association, and the co-presidents of the HBS Latino Student Organization attended Friday’s meeting, where they discussed Latino representation on the search committee and qualities they would like to see in Harvard’s 29th president.
In a letter to the search committee over the summer, Latino alumni groups raised concerns about the lack of Latino representation on the search committee, calling on committee members to prioritize candidates from underrepresented backgrounds with experience leading diverse teams. Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation William F. Lee ’72, who is leading the search committee, reached out to Cardona to arrange a meeting after receiving the letter.
“It went really well. [Bacow] was really forthcoming with insight on how they’ve gone about the process,” Cardona said of the discussion.
Bacow pointed to Latino members on the student, faculty, and staff advisory committees, according to Cardona, and he told meeting attendees Friday that the search committee will solicit input from a wide range of Harvard-affiliated constituencies—including alumni association members in many different U.S. cities.
“He went through this enormous list of constituencies that they’re meeting with, and even groups from other universities about how they approach the process,” she said.
Cardona said they did not discuss specific candidates, even though the groups had proposed a list of eight potential Latino contenders in their original letter.
“I was in full listening mode,” Bacow said as he left Loeb House, the Corporation’s traditional rendezvous spot, Friday morning. He declined to comment further on the search.
Cardona also met with Business School professor Youngme E. Moon, a member of the faculty committee advising the search, to discuss the qualities the next president should have in order to best promote diversity at Harvard.
“She asked me what would we consider the litmus test to ensure that whoever gets selected can take on these challenges. And for me it was really a track record of building diverse teams, and of bringing underrepresented voices to the table,” Cardona said.
She said Moon also voiced interest in the Latino groups’ proposals, including the idea of creating a Latino advisory group that would provide guidance to the next president.
After the meetings, Cardona said the groups “feel heard.” But she said they want to keep lines of communication to Massachusetts Hall open after the new president takes over.
“Our objective is to have an open line of communication with the president,” she said.

With the construction of its $1 billion Science and Engineering Complex in Allston well underway, Harvard announced plans to build an additional 9,000 square-foot building for student art-making a few blocks west of the complex, the University announced Monday.
Located at the intersection of North Harvard St. and Western Ave.—down the road from Harvard Stadium and across from the newly-opened Trader Joe’s grocery store—the proposed “ArtLab” will house an audio recording studio, sound editing stations, and performance spaces.
The ArtLab will operate alongside, but is not part of, Harvard’s “innovations labs cluster” in Allston. The Innovation Lab opened in 2011 to support student-led entrepreneurial projects, the  Launch Lab in 2014 to support Harvard alumni entrepreneurs, and the Life Lab in 2016 to incubate Harvard-affiliated life science startups.
While the Science and Engineering Complex, which will house two-thirds of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, has featured prominently in discussions about the University’s development plans across the Charles River, Harvard is also looking to create space for artists on its Allston campus.
"The ArtLab also represents our firm commitment to ensuring that creative and artistic innovation are at the heart of our campus,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a press release.
In response to the 2008 Report of the Task Force on the Arts, Harvard has invested in providing more arts-specific programming and physical spaces. The ArtLab will add to existing programming at the Ceramics Studio, Ed Portal, and Zone 3, a Harvard-initiated project to host creative programs and local events open to the public.
Faust said she views the ArtLab as “a home where faculty, staff, and students can engage in the kinds of interdisciplinary collaboration both within and beyond the curriculum.”
Robin Kelsey, dean of Arts and Humanities and co-chair of the ArtLab Steering Committee, emphasized the divergence from Harvard’s history of approaching art in a non-interdisciplinary way.
“The ArtLab will give them a space to mingle and experiment, free from the usual restraints of school, department, or medium,” Kelsey said in a press release.
The Boston Planning and Development Agency will require Harvard to file an amendment to its 2013 Institutional Master Plan. This will initiate an approval process.
If approved, the construction of ArtLab could begin as early as summer of 2018 for completion in early 2019.

The Faculty Council will vote again on an amended version of Government Professor Danielle S. Allen’s motion on College social policy, potentially revising their unanimous vote of support for the motion last month.
The motion, introduced at the October 3 meeting of the full Faculty, seeks to apply the College's Student Handbook standards to campus social groups. By Allen’s interpretation, under these standards, members of all single-gender final clubs or Greek organization members would be considered “ineligible to continue enrollment at the College.”
Allen’s amendment to the motion adds the first use of the phrase “student organizations” to the following: “the policies of the Harvard College Handbook for Students for student organizations pertain to all student organizations recognized as such by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”
The Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body—spent significant time discussing the Allen motion at their meeting last Wednesday, according to Council member David L. Howell.
At the October Faculty meeting, some professors questioned whether Allen’s motion was legally possible. Days later, Allen published an editorial in The Crimson arguing that her motion had been misrepresented and further clarifying its implications.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in an interview after the meeting that he did not know what administrative actions would result from the passage of Allen’s motion.
The current policy, originally announced in May 2016, bars students in unrecognized single-gender social organizations, starting with the Class of 2021, from holding club leadership positions or athletic team captaincies or receiving College nominations for certain fellows. However, this policy is subject to change and the source of intense debate at Faculty meetings over the past year.
Howell said the Faculty Council also heard a presentation from the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging and considered proposals on advanced standing, cross-registration, and the timing of Faculty meetings next year, when a new class schedule will take effect.

Four former Obama-era national security officials criticized the Trump administration’s approach foreign policy at the Institute of Politics Monday night.
Rachel Maddow, MSNBC television host and liberal political commentator, introduced the speakers, which included former Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter, former Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz, former Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh C. Johnson, and former Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha J. Power. Both Power and Carter currently hold posts at Harvard.
Maddow began the event on a light note before moving to a more substantive discussion of America’s standing in the world.
“Let me just confirm at the outset that none of you are running for President,” she asked.
The panelists said national security efforts tend to be consistent across presidential administrations. Carter spoke about an American mission in Raqqa, Syria against ISIS that has “pretty much stayed on track” as an example of a continuous approach. But Carter said the Trump administration’s stance towards North Korea and Iran represent “the opposite direction than what was set” under the Obama administration.
“That’s one area where I think there may be a sharp discontinuity, unfortunately so,” he said.
Carter also criticized the erosion of norms in the “political space.”
“I think behaving oneself is pretty important. It’s partly [the President] no doubt, and it’s partly—you know after this campaign people feel like they’re loosed from the bounds of telling the truth, treating other people decently,” he said.
Moniz likewise expressed concerns that American foreign policy and diplomacy do not currently reflect American values.
“Projecting American values is a national security imperative. It’s an enormous underpinning of what we can do and what we can do with allies,” he said,
Moniz said that a renewed interest in the American nuclear arsenal could be a “terrible mistake.”
“Is the role of nuclear weapons for deterrence? Or is it something we would use as a battlefield weapon?” he asked.
Power likewise lambasted the Trump administration for what she perceived as a failure to carry out a foreign policy that supported American values. She argued that  China might be able to supplant the United States on the world stage without proper American leadership.
“We have a State Department that’s rewriting its mission statement to cut democracy promotion from even its stated purpose,” she said. “That’s a fundamental misunderstanding of the political capital we have around the world, and it allows China to step right in.”
Maddow also asked panelists what they might have done differently had they known that Trump would be elected. In particular, she quipped about Moniz’s successor as the Secretary of Energy.
“In your case had you had the crystal ball that told you Donald Trump was going to win the election, I think that crystal ball still would not have told you that your successor would be Rick Perry,” Maddow said.
Moniz said he would not have changed much about how he led the department had he known about Trump’s victory.
“We had very clear objectives across our various missions, nuclear security being one of the big ones, but energy, basic science, et cetera,” Moniz said, “I think our department was remarkably nonpartisan, and viewed as such in the Congress. And that does provide stability.”
Maddow said farewell after audience questions and praised the accomplishment of the panelists.
“It’s an honor to be here today, but it also just makes me proud of us as a country to have had the wealth of intellect and civic good-heartedness that is represented on the stage, having held such positions of power in our government,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing to Cornell last week, Harvard football needed to make a statement. Against Lafayette (2-5, 2-0 Patriot) on Saturday, the Crimson did just that.
In a 38-10 victory, Harvard (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) dominated the ground game and special teams play. The win gives the Crimson momentum heading into five straight games against Ancient Eight rivals.
“We challenged our kids, and they responded,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They have a lot of pride and a lot of character—they responded.”
6A HAS IT HIS WAY
Junior running back Charlie Booker has been carrying teams since 2014, when he led Cypress Ranch High School to the Texas state title game.
The Mustangs started 1-2 that year, but Booker captained the 6A program to 12 consecutive wins. The run ended in AT&T Stadium, when Cypress Ranch fell despite 115 rushing yards and from Booker.
While the Mustangs lost the game, Booker won something else—Murphy’s attention.
“I remember very vividly watching his state championship game,” Murphy said. “He’s playing against guys that are going to the SEC. He’s playing against guys that are going to the Big 12…. He just pounded it out.”
Last Saturday, the 5’9” Booker delivered another highlight performance, pummeling Lafayette for 159 yards and a score on 23 carries. As a team, the Crimson rushed for 296 yards.
Freshman running back Aaron Shampklin complemented Booker with 82 yards on 22 carriers. This two-back strategy has worked all season. Booker is averaging 99 yards per game, while Shampklin adds 49. The two have combined for seven touchdowns and one fumble.
On Saturday, rushing productivity extended beyond the backs. As a high school senior, quarterback Jake Smith ran for 24 touchdowns on 9.6 yards per carry. Now a Harvard freshman, Smith notched his first college score in the fourth quarter.
The offensive line has played a critical role in rushing success. Sophomore Liam Shanahan, junior Matt Jones, junior Tim O’Brien, senior Daniel Laden, and junior Ben Shoults have emerged as starters. That contingent opened holes for Booker and others all day long.
DAILY SPECIAL TEAMS
Leopards kicker Jeffrey Kordenbrock had a plan.
Early in the first half, the freshman had watched junior wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley race 85 yards for a punt-return touchdown. Now, with the second half about to start, Kordenbrock decided to loft the ball away from Shelton-Mosley.
The plan worked perfectly—until junior wide receiver Adam Scott started to run. Shelton-Mosley and senior tight end Jack Stansell threw key blocks, and within seconds, the Scott had reached the end zone.
Special teams and penalties. Penalties and special teams. Coaches harp on these metrics as keys to success. In 2016, the Crimson struggled on both accounts, posting the lowest kickoff return average (15.2 yards) and most penalties per game (7.7) among Ivy League teams.
Last Saturday told a different story. Harvard didn’t see a flag until midway through the third quarter. And the special teams racked up 14 points thanks to Scott and Shelton-Mosley.
Shelton-Mosley’s touchdown came three minutes into play, when he fielded a punt at the left hash and swept right. Junior wide receiver Henry Taylor cleared out the kicker, and Shelton-Mosley sprinted past the goal line.
“The blocking was tremendous,” Murphy said. “It wasn’t a question of whether it was going to be a good return. It was a question of whether it was going to be a house call.”
LINEBACKERS BACK IN LINE
If the Crimson ever runs out of wide receivers, Murphy might want to consider linebacker Luke Hutton. Last Saturday, the senior nearly came up with two exceptional interceptions.
The first came on a crossing route. Hutton dove, somersaulted, and seemed to roll the ball over his cleat. Referees ruled otherwise.
The second came when freshman quarterback Sean O’Malley tried to heave the ball out of bounds. Hutton raced to the sidelines and tried to drag his feet. Again, referees ruled otherwise.
Remarkably, the senior got his hands on the ball a third time when he batted down a pass in the third quarter. Put simply, Hutton was everywhere.
He needed to be. Injured defenders populated the Harvard sideline. Junior linebacker Anthony Camargo held a crutch. Junior cornerback Wes Ogsbury wore a hard boot. Senior cornerback Tobe Ezekoli wore a soft one.
Setbacks have especially hit linebackers. On Saturday, sophomores Joey Goodman and Matt Farber returned to action after skipping the Cornell contest.
The most impactful addition has been junior linebacker Charlie Walker, who missed all 2016 with a major leg injury. In the past two weeks, Walker has racked up 17 tackles. The Keller, Texas, native hits with ferocity and blankets receivers in the pass game.
Along with teammates, Walker approached the Leopards game with renewed fire after giving up 233 rushing yards to the Big Red.
“We were almost embarrassed…to put [the Cornell game] on film and send that to other teams as if we allow others to run down our throat,” Walker said. “It was nice to come out and show everybody that we’re not going to accept something like that.”
