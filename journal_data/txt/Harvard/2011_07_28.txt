After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian A. Schroeder, a 2009 Harvard Law School graduate who pleaded guilty to setting fire to a chapel containing Sept. 11 victims’ remains and mementos, had his fine for the crime set at $50,000 at a court hearing Monday.
While prosecutors pushed for jail time and a fine of $180,000, Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller said that Schroeder would pay only $50,000, according to media reports.
In court proceedings last December, Schroeder pleaded guilty to burglary, criminal mischief, and cemetery desecration. At the time, Uviller also ruled against a jail sentence, instead putting Schroeder on probation with mandatory community service and alcohol counseling.
While none of the victims’ remains that were temporarily housed in the New York City chapel were harmed in the arson, many items that family and friends of victims had placed at the chapel were destroyed.
At the time, the New York Daily News branded him "New York’s newest Public Enemy #1."
Schroeder turned himself in, claiming that he was intoxicated at the time and that he barely remembered his actions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Institute of Politics announced their fall fellows on Thursday, a lineup with a range of backgrounds including journalism, banking, and politics.
The resident fellows arrive in early September and will lead weekly study groups during the fall term at the IOP.
Fellows include two assistants to former presidents. Ronald I. Christie was a special assistant to President George W. Bush, and Linda Moore Forbes was a deputy assistant to President Bill Clinton.
Two political consultants, Democrat Thomas A. "Tad" Devine and Republican Steve Grand, are also fellows, as well as political journalist Christina Bellantoni.
A fellow with a background in banking will also be in the mix. Diane Casey-Landry, the former president of America's Community Bankers, was most recently the senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of the American Bankers Association.
Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell will arrive at the IOP in October as a visiting fellow, where, in addition to leading study groups, he will meet with student organizations and participate in public policy classes.
“This accomplished group of practitioners with strong experience in governing, government relations, campaign strategy, journalism, and White House policy and political affairs is sure to captivate and inspire students and the University community,” said IOP Director C. M. Trey Grayson '94 in a press release.
Prospective fellows must submit applications, which are then considered by a student advisory committee and the staff and director of the IOP. While the director makes the final decision, the student recommendations carry large weight, said Eric R. Andersen, program manager for fellows and study groups at the IOP.
“[The IOP] is the bridge between academic and practical politics,” Andersen said. “These fellows have real experience in policy, public service, and journalism, and they can provide students with practical educations they might not get in academic pursuits.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the wake of news that embattled psychology professor Marc D. Hauser will resign his tenured position at the University, a group of prominent academics are circulating a letter criticizing Harvard’s handling of the allegations leveled at Hauser.
The letter criticizes Harvard’s investigation into Hauser’s work and reflects a feeling in the academic community that Harvard did not properly handle the investigation and the resulting media frenzy. Among the signatories is MIT Linguistics Professor Noam Chomsky.
The Chronicle of Higher Education was the first to report news of the letter.
While universities usually keep internal investigations into a professor’s work confidential, Harvard responded to media scrutiny last August by releasing a summary of the findings of the three-year internal investigation, which found Hauser "solely responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct."
The details of the investigation have remained confidential and have been tightly guarded by University administrators.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith noted that because Hauser received federal funding for his research, the committee in charge of the Harvard investigation turned over its findings to the Office of Research Integrity in accordance with federal policy.
On the heels of the investigation becoming public, Hauser took a one year leave of absence, went to his home on the Cape to work on a book, and remained silent on the issue.
But the lack of information about the case and a surprisingly drawn out federal investigation has raised questions within the academic community.
The average ORI investigation releases its findings in seven months, according to Ann Bradley, a spokesperson for the ORI. But the ORI investigation has now lasted for over a year, and the ORI has not released any information about the case, declining to even confirm that an investigation is ongoing.
Last February, the Psychology Department voted to bar Hauser from teaching for the 2011-2012 academic year.  In an interview with The Crimson last May, Psychology Department Chair Susan E. Carey '64 said the department refrained from making a permanent decision because it was “waiting for the ORI to make its findings public.”
Despite a blistering internal investigation and a one-year teaching ban, many, like Carey, considered the ORI findings to be the final verdict on Hauser.
“Each of us has heard rumors, and each of us has our own opinions about what Hauser probably did or did not do,” Carey said in May. “But those opinions are really worth nothing. The due process goes through the Committee on Professional Conduct and ORI.”
As a result, many in the academic community were surprised that Hauser resigned before the conclusion of the ORI investigation.
