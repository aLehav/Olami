After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Only the premise of Vi Khi Nao’s first novel, “Fish in Exile,” resembles anything from a traditional narrative: A couple in their early 30s grieve over and reconcile with losing their two toddlers in a drowning accident. Everything beyond this foundation defies the trappings of both the novel form and the rational motivation that usually propel realism. Though at moments the unconventional use of medium and language in “Fish in Exile” feels heavy-handed, Nao takes this simple seed of narrative and, using a unique alchemy of allusion and unnerving linguistic innovation, expands it into an ocean full of bizarre, pulsing brilliance.
Nao elevates and enriches “Fish in Exile” through a huge number of explicit allusions that include “The Odyssey,” “Ulysses,” the myth of Persephone and Demeter, and David Foster Wallace, among others. Many occurrences or characters that are essential to “Fish in Exile” would make little sense without this allegorical framework. Some conventional plot points do serve as backbone—Ethos and Catholic Romulus cheat on each other with their neighbors, Lidia and Callisto; Catholic gets her tubes tied; Ethos debates whether or not to return to his job as a teacher—but others diverge farther from the rational—Ethos and Catholic build a large aquarium and occupy it with fish for which Catholic sews intricate, fish-sized toddlers’ clothing. Even the names themselves could only be allusions. These subtexts allow us to understand these moments as entirely allegorical, mythical, or metaphorical, a point that Nao slyly makes in a line of dialogue: “I don’t believe that the mind can distinguish between the literal world and the conceptual world.” Such potent references could easily evade control, but as the novel unfolds and layers through more perspectives and voices, Nao winds each new metaphor and detail around what has come before, carefully sustaining and augmenting every allusive thread. What could have been chaotically pinwheeling lines of thought instead becomes an engaging, resonant fugue.
Given the works that Nao chooses to reference, allusion often necessitates unconventional formatting or diction—in a reference to the Platonic dialogues, for example, all speech is written as if for a play’s script. Nao also restructures the traditional novel form using her own rules, which sometimes works but at other times feels unnecessary. An effective formatting gamble: In the middle of an otherwise empty page, Catholic confesses, “Now that I can’t give birth to anyone anymore, I feel I am truly receding,” and the sentence literally recedes into the surrounding white space. The one-time usage of the plus-sign in lieu of “and,” on the other hand—“frozen water + atmosphere + vapor + ice crystals,” says Ethos—feels arbitrary and gimmicky. On a larger scale, Nao partitions the novel into six chapters: Ethos, Charleen, and Catholic’s first-person narrations; dialogue among Charleen, Lidia and Catholic; and a news interview with Lidia and Catholic. Each represents a facet of grief, guilt, and love entirely distinct from yet in dialogue with the others, a format through which Nao can exercise the full range of her stunning prose and keen empathetic eye.
An esteemed poet, Nao boldly bends, breaks, and rearranges her language as well. Many of her metaphors keenly and unforgettably juxtapose banal and wondrous, modern and ancient. “The glass serpent will contain our history in its belly,” Catholic says of the aquarium. “An oral history of footsteps, sobs, running water, refrigerator hums, plate echoes, jar rattles, clicked heels, and creaking doors.” As with the structuring, some unusual choices feel distracting rather than innovative, but the overall effect is what distinguishes “Fish in Exile” as a worthy addition to the literary canon. At the novel’s heart are the unique ways in which Nao represents grief and the experience of living a tragedy-shattered life.
Like “Ulysses,” “Fish in Exile” is predominantly about subtle and intangible shifts in consciousness. The multitude of perspective and voices, especially set in such in fertile allusive grounds, give Nao the space to powerfully depict not only grief and loss but also gender, gradations and distortions of love, and the incommunicable feeling of existence. Ethos, for example, whose first-person narration is the most insularly stream-of-conscious, offers some of the most innovatively compelling (if, at times, also the most overbearing) representations of mourning. Ethos obsesses Knausgaard-like over the corporeal, arduously detailing movement, brand names, and the body as collection of surfaces; at the same time, identity and sense of self become detached from physical existence. As Catholic walks away from Ethos, “Each step strikes [him] higher in the stairwell of his loneliness.” But he describes getting into bed as “I insert my body between the bedsheets,” rather than “I get between the bedsheets”; or “I push the paper sack into her body” rather than “I give her the paper sack.”
“Fish in Exile” concludes as Ethos and Catholic descend to their basement, the “lower cosmos”—like Odysseus and Persephone, like Leopold Bloom and Stephen Daedalus—where Catholic experiences realization, or perhaps reconciliation: incommunicable feelings of circularity and universality; a jumble of raw emotion and mythology and Biblical memory and scientific language; an accelerated rush in which all the novel’s elements churn, like a wave finally breaking at the end of its journey. As Ethos and Catholic finally re-consummate their union, one cannot help but think of Molly Bloom’s famous concluding soliloquy in “Ulysses.” The impressions that last, however, will be entirely Nao’s own: all the wondrous forms she has revealed to us, the image of them luminescent, flourishing, in the seemingly dark and empty waters of grief.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard lecturer and Dunster House resident dean Carlos E. Díaz Rosillo will advise President-elect Donald Trump during his transition to the presidency, Politico reported Friday.
Díaz Rosillo will serve as Trump’s “Executive Authority Adviser” for the president-elect’s “Policy Implementation” team, according to a document obtained by Politico.
At Harvard, Díaz Rosillo lectures on government, teaching the popular class Government 1359: “The Road to the White House,” which covered Trump’s electoral success in depth. The course, offered both semesters in 2016, saw a surge in enrollment in the spring.
Diaz Rosillo could not immediately be reached for comment Friday.
Since Trump’s unexpected victory early Wednesday morning, the president-elect’s transition team has worked to assemble his new administration. Trump aides announced Friday that Vice President-elect Mike Pence would lead the transition effort, taking over from New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.
“Busy day planned in New York,” Trump tweeted early Friday morning. “Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!”
While Harvard professors have regularly worked with presidents and presidential candidates, few are likely to do so for Trump. His victory on Nov. 8 sent shockwaves across Harvard’s largely liberal campus, with students and professors alike expressing surprise and concern over the election results. The day after Trump officially won the presidency, some professors postponed exams to help ease students’ schedules.
Prior to the election last Tuesday, only six percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates indicated they had planned to vote for Trump, according to The Crimson’s election survey published last month. In comparison, 87 percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates indicated they would support Clinton.
Also on the policy team, according to Politico, is Ado Machida, a former aide to former Vice President Dick Cheney, and Andrew Bremberg, an adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI— A typical Harvard men’s basketball game at Lavietes Pavilion garners a few hundred fans, and swells in Ivy play. But for the Crimson’s season opener against Stanford in Shanghai on Saturday (Friday at 11 PM EST), the team will be performing for a much larger audience.
In the second year of the it’s Globalization Initiative, the Pac-12 has partnered with the Alibaba Group and its sports branch, AliSports, to broadcast the contest all over China along with the thousands of fans expected to watch the game in person.
Broadcasting games online is nothing new for the Crimson or Cardinal. Since 2013, the Ivy League has operated the Ivy League Digital Network (ILDN), which streams thousands of Ancient Eight events every year. The Pac-12 operates on an even larger scale, operating the Pac-12 Networks, which it describes as “the first and only sports media company owned by its 12 universities.”
According to AliSports CEO Zhang Dazhong, who spoke at a press conference on Thursday at Shanghai Disneyland Hotel alongside FUSC Vice President and Secretary-General Liguo Yang and Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, it is the strength of the Pac-12 media network that inspired the partnership between the two organizations.
Alisports, which launched in September 2015, currently has agreements with the FIFA World Cup, the NFL, the International Boxing Associaton, and Ocean Sports Entertainment, which promotes match poker in China, but Alibaba has always had a connection to Ivy League Sports, as Alibaba Vice Chairman Joe Tsai is a former Yale lacrosse player.
While fans in the U.S. will be able to watch the Pac-12 China Game on ESPN, a subsection of the Disney Company, Chinese fans will have a variety of viewing options.
“This game is going to be widely viewed, not only by what we expect to be a very energetic audience at the Mercedes-Benz Arena on Saturday, but its going to be broadcast on television around the globe thanks to our partners at AliSports who are going to be producing the broadcast that is going to be distributed throughout China,” Scott said. “Fans will be able to see the game on CCTV, provincial television channels like Beijing TV as well as several digital channels like Alibaba’s Youku service and the FUSC’s Jing Sports.”
Jing Sports, like the Ivy League Digital Network, is a growing online platform for the Federation of University Sports of China (FUSC) to broadcast games throughout the country and grow a greater fan base for its teams.
Yang spoke of FUSC’s visit to the Pac-12’s media home base where they saw how a major sports network is run. The FUSC representative spoke of the impressiveness of the advanced equipment and management structure at the Pac-12 that he hopes FUSC can emulate. Yang noted that Jing Sports currently produces over 400 events worth of content, but that their major issue is in content promotion—which they hope AliSports can help with.
“For the population under 45, they don’t watch TV, only online,” Yang said through a translator. “Even though our Jing Sports isn’t very popular, it has a good penetrating rate.”
For Jing Sport’s largest coverage of a marathon event in China, the platform garnered five new members every five minutes, a rate it hopes it can sustain.
“Among students, among parents of students, we have a big audience for Jing Sports,” Yang said. “We should learn more from Ali and Pac-12 on how do we make better use of media to spread the news.”
Much like Jing Sports and the Chinese sports broadcast array of networks is growing, the Ivy League is looking to grow its reach on the screen. While the men’s basketball team is in China, Harvard Athletics announced that 15 Harvard basketball games would be televised across four networks—American Sports Network, ESPN3, New England Sports Network, and ONE World Sports. Ten men’s contests will be broadcast—including Crimson Madness, which took place on Oct. 14—and five women’s games. In total, 23 games will be broadcast on ILDN.
While television networks like ESPN3 and NESN may draw fans away from the paid ILDN platform, Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris, who is attending the game in Shanghai, believes that getting more screen time for the league in any capacity can only help the ILDN.
“[ESPN3] is a terrific opportunity to feature the network and showcase it to fans that haven’t subscribed yet,” Harris said to The Crimson in 2014. “The hope is that fans will tune in and watch…and then say, ‘Wow, this is great production, I’m going to subscribe [to the ILDN] so I can watch the other games this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
SHANGHAI–What gets lost in presentations at one of the world’s largest companies, trips to ancient temples, parades at Shanghai Disney, jetlag from a 20-hour trip, photo ops with Bill Walton and Jason Collins, and press conferences with the Chinese media is that there is a basketball game to be played.
The Harvard men’s basketball team will begin its regular season and cap off its week-long trip to Shanghai with a matchup with arguably its most challenging nonconference foe, as the Crimson will take on Stanford on Saturday afternoon (11 PM EST) at Mercedes-Benz Arena.
“We’re looking forward to the opportunity to compete and to play,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “To start the season off here is a wonderful moment for all of us, but to face an opponent like Stanford is not usually something we sign up for at this time in the season. We have an amazing amount of respect for their program and their institution.”
The 2016 edition of the Pac-12 China Game features two teams loaded with talent looking to bounce back from disappointing campaigns last season. The Cardinal returns eight of its nine players who averaged at least 12 minutes a contest a season ago while Harvard counters with three-time All-Ivy pick Siyani Chambers, who missed last season with a torn ACL, and a class of seven talented freshmen. Jerod Haase, formerly the head man at UAB and an assistant coach under Roy Williams at both Kansas and North Carolina, took over the reins at Stanford in March. Amaker will begin his tenth season with the Crimson on Saturday.
Stanford was bitten by the injury bug last season but is expected to have a fully healthy roster on Saturday. Sophomore point guard Robert Cartwright and junior forward Reid Travis combined to play just eight games last season but both figure to be in the starting lineup for the Cardinal.
They will likely be joined by senior guard Marcus Allen, junior forward Michael Humphrey, and junior swingman Dorian Pickens. Haase will also have a deep bench at his disposal, headlined by last year’s starting point guard Christian Sanders and wings Marcus Sheffield and Kodye Pugh.
Harvard will counter with its core of Chambers, sophomore shooting guard Corey Johnson, and senior center Zena Edosomwan. Outside of the trio, it remains to be seen how Amaker will utilize the rest of his roster. Eleven different players, not including co-captain Corbin Miller, have logged ten or more minutes in at least one of the team’s exhibition games this season. However, Amaker figures to stick with a smaller rotation on Saturday. Freshman Seth Towns will likely start on the wing opposite Johnson while several of his classmates will see key minutes off the bench.
The matchup to watch will be between Travis, the younger brother of Harvard forward Jonah Travis ’15, and Harvard’s rotation at the power forward position. Junior Chris Egi and freshman Chris Lewis will likely be tasked with shutting down the game’s most talented player. Egi and Lewis have the size (6’9”, 220 and 6’9”, 235, respectively) but the former averaged just 11.5 minutes per game last season while the latter will be making his collegiate debut.
“We’re excited for the game,” Haase said. “Most US teams start the first weekend of the regular season at home with a lesser opponent and needless to say, we’re obviously not going that route. It’s not exactly a home game and our level of respect for Harvard is off the charts. It’s going to be a tremendous battle.”
Despite the x-factor in Travis, the Crimson will likely have the edge shooting the ball. Johnson set the Harvard freshman three-point record a season ago while Miller is in range once the ball crosses halfcourt. Towns and classmate Bryce Aiken bring the midrange game Harvard lacked last year.
Defense has been the calling card of Amaker-led teams during his time in Cambridge and the length of this year’s freshmen figures to strengthen a defense that allowed just under 65 points a game last season.
The magnitude of the game will definitely be reflected in its coverage. The contest will be broadcast on ESPN2 in the US and throughout China via Alibaba’s new sports platform. Mercedes-Benz Arena is the largest non-NBA arena the Crimson will have played at during the Amaker era.
“We’re very proud to participate, very proud to represent our institution and represent the Ivy League as a whole,” Amaker said. “To learn about the culture and history, the tradition here in this amazing country has been amazing for all of us”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday night at Franklin Field, with just over three minutes left on the game clock, it appeared that overtime was likely in the heavyweight bout between Harvard and Penn football.
After going down 14-3, the Crimson had scored 11 fourth-quarter points to tie the game. The comeback had great importance, as a win over the Quakers would assure Harvard a share of the Ancient Eight title.
But with 3:23 remaining, senior quarterback Alek Torgersen took control. He guided the Penn offense downfield bolstered by ample time in the pocket and relatively unguarded receivers. The drive culminated with a quick strike to junior wide receiver Justin Watson to make it 21-14 with 15 seconds left.
“I think the touchdown showed a lot of confidence to throw the ball from the two-yard line,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “They just did a great job executing the one-and-a-half minute drill and made all the plays when they had to.”
Three plays later, a celebratory somersault into the end zone proved to be a fitting end to the rivalry matchup.
On a desperation try with five seconds left in the game, senior quarterback Joe Viviano saw his primary wide receiver, Justice Shelton-Mosley, open over the middle. While the sophomore caught the pass, cornerback Sam Philippi forced a botched pitch. Teammate Tayler Hendrickson caught the ball, ran to the end zone, and put the game away for good with a front flip.
The competitiveness began early in the night. Just after the coin toss, the Crimson and the Quakers converged at midfield. Referees broke up the scrum, with both teams eventually returning to their sidelines. It was a sign of a contentious battle to come.
And a battle it was. Penn (6-3, 5-1 Ivy) and Harvard (7-2, 5-1) traded blows on offense all game, but it was the timeliness of game-changing plays that gave the Quakers the win. With a 27-14 victory, Penn prevented the Crimson from clinching an Ivy title.
That task remains for next week, when Harvard can claim at least a share of a championship with a win over Yale.
“Obviously Yale has tremendous meaning for us, no matter the records,” Murphy said. “It now has the utmost meaning because we still control our own destiny to get a piece of the Ivy League championship.”
The Quakers had an advantage for much of the second, third, and fourth quarters, but a Crimson field goal and touchdown in the fourth made the game competitive again.
With about four minutes remaining, Viviano fired a pass to Shelton-Mosley, who snagged the ball and kept his feet in bounds. This completion set up a crucial touchdown to senior wide receiver Joseph Foster to bring Harvard within two points. A tricky two-point conversion attempt featuring a direct snap and a pass from Shelton-Mosley to Viviano tied the game at 14.
Harvard accumulated 352 total yards to Penn’s 284, but turnovers and missed opportunities proved costly. Interceptions were a problem for Viviano in the first half. The Berwyn, Pa., native threw three picks in the second quarter alone.
On two of the three interceptions, Viviano was forced to scramble as the pocket collapsed around him, so the offensive line was at least partially to blame for the errant throws.
The senior quarterback was also sacked six times. Often scrambling to evade the rush, he seemed to be unable to find his receivers consistently.
Harvard appeared poised to add to its 3-0 lead in the second quarter, but Viviano was intercepted by sophomore cornerback Mason Williams on third down in field goal range.
“We take on a bend-don’t-break motto and try not to worry about the offense moving the ball,” defensive end Louis Vecchio said. “The closer that they get, it’s almost harder for them to get in.”
The Crimson defense did its job, forcing a Penn punt and setting up another drive for Viviano.
However, on a screen pass to Viviano’s right, Vecchio bolted in between the quarterback and his intended target. Vecchio tipped the ball up over his head and came down with the interception. He sprinted to the end zone to put Penn on top, 7-3.
“It was one of those plays where I really didn’t think—just kind of reacted,” Vecchio said. “The first thing I thought about when I got the ball was, one, don’t fumble and the other thing was, get in the end zone as fast as I can.”
With 19 seconds left in the first half, Harvard had advanced to Penn’s 28 yard line. Rather than try for a field goal on fourth down, Murphy elected to take a shot for the end zone. Viviano appeared unable to find an open receiver and threw up a floater. Williams came down with his second interception of the game.
The timely turnovers provided Torgersen with several opportunities to put Penn on the board, but the Quakers’ only points in the first half came on the defensive score.
Even so, Torgersen seemed very comfortable in the pocket against Harvard’s pass rush. He took his time on a deep touchdown pass to sophomore wide receiver Christian Pearson at the beginning of the third quarter. Pearson faked a cut to the left, which shook junior safety Tanner Lee, and the wideout had plenty of room to make the catch and get in for the score.
Harvard completely dominated Penn’s ground game in the early going, and the visitors extended this dominance throughout the game. The Quakers carried the ball 20 times and netted only 21 yards, and primary rusher Tre Solomon averaged 2.2 yards per carry.
On the other hand, Harvard’s rushing attack bolstered the turnover-plagued offense. Sophomore Charlie Booker got 15 carries out of the backfield rushed for 64 yards. Junior Semar Smith and freshman Lavance Northington combined for another 44.
“Really proud of our kids because they battled and hung in there,” Murphy said. “They played heroically defensively at times. But at the end of the day, we just made too many mistakes to beat a good football team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday when the Harvard men’s hockey team needed a lift, a Crimson co-captain provided it. This Friday with Harvard seeking a similar boost, another co-captain followed suit.
A week ago it was Alexander Kerfoot, tipping home an equalizer that salvaged a point out of the Crimson’s conference opener against Colgate. And this time it was Devin Tringale, tallying his first career game-winning goal in the third period of a 5-2 victory over Princeton at Hobey Baker Memorial Arena.
With the score even at two, Tringale collected the puck in his own zone and marched his way 140 feet down the ice, swerving through the right faceoff circle before arriving at Princeton goaltender Colton Phinney’s post. There, the co-captain flung a shot that beat Phinney short-side to put No. 10/10 Harvard (4-0-1, 2-0-1 ECAC) in front, 3-2, with 16:24 to play.
That’s how the score would remain for another 11-plus minutes, before another unlikely goal-scorer—sophomore defenseman Viktor Dombrovskiy—put the Crimson in control. Off a perfect feed from junior Seb Lloyd, who circled the Princeton net prior to producing the pass, Dombrovskiy looked the part of a forward as he stick-handled his way into the slot and beat Phinney high stick-side with a sharp wrister.
Sophomore Lewis Zerter-Gossage would tack on an empty-netter—his fourth goal in the last two contests—in the game’s final minute.
Ryan Donato, the wing opposite Zerter-Gossage, kicked off the scoring for Harvard 11:58 into the game. Following a quiet start for both sides, Donato turned things around after spinning off top-pair defenseman Josh Teves in the corner below the end line. With a step on Teves, the Boston Bruins prospect took off for the net and slipped a shot past Phinney from atop the crease to put the Crimson ahead.
Harvard’s lead quickly disappeared in period two, however, as Princeton second-liners Jeremy Germain and Eric Robinson each scored less than four minutes apart in the early stages of the frame. Germain’s goal was poked past Merrick Madsen from just outside the blue paint, whereas Robinson unleashed a rocket off iron and in from the top of the slot.
The Tigers’ lead was their first against the Crimson since March 2013, when Princeton defeated Harvard, 2-1, in overtime. Nonetheless, the Tigers (0-4-0, 0-3-0) have had a knack for giving the Crimson a run for its money as of late. Harvard won both meetings between the two sides a season ago, but each time, the two sides were separated by a single goal early in the third period.
Senior forward Tyler Moy erased the Princeton lead with 2:21 left to play in the second period, picking the upper right corner of the net from behind the left faceoff dot. Tringale picked up an assist on the play, and his eventual game-winner would give him the second multi-point night of his career.
