After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“To find a novelist with such nuance and precision, one would perhaps need to return to Dickens or James.” Such was the praise levied by Bret A. Johnston, author and director of Harvard’s creative writing department, while introducing the Morris Gray Lecturer for Fall 2010, novelist John Irving. Author of “A Prayer for Owen Meany,” National Book Award Winner “The World According to Garp,” and “The Cider House Rules,” (for whose screen adaptation he received an Academy Award), Irving responded to questions that fans had emailed him in advance, and then read extensively from his forthcoming novel, “In One Person," at the Arthur M. Sackler Museum on Wednesday.
Discussing his craft, Irving was careful to avoid giving strong directives to aspiring novelists. “Please don't think that I am one of those writers who, in speaking about his process, is actively recommending it,” he said. “There's no 'should' in what I'm about to tell you.”’
One fan questioned Irving about his tendency to begin a novel with its last sentence. “Yes, I always begin with the last sentence—sometimes, I write two or three of the final paragraphs, if I can. I'm a 'plotting' kind of person. I'm constantly thinking about the language, the language, the language. I need to know what the final voice of the novel is, so that I can begin in a slightly different voice, a few years earlier.”
Irving acknowledged that his particular writing process involves a great deal of planning and precision. “I know it's very controlling, but that is what I do. Will I be devastated if I write a final line, and then one day go back and change it? No, this isn't religion, there's no fear in changing the text.” However, the chances that Irving's final lines will ever undergo revision seem slim. “This is my thirteenth novel. First sentences change all the time. But the last sentences? Those never change for me,” he affirmed.
In particular, when Irving's closing lines take the form of dialogue they form something of a refrain for the rest of the work. “Whenever there's dialogue at the end of one of my novels, it's always dialogue you've heard earlier in the novel, but in a different context,” he explained.
Shifting from the subject of process to the specific content of his works, Irving responded to a fan’s highly convoluted and densely worded question about the meaning of his novel “The World According to Garp.” Playfully reacting to the question’s painful lack of clarity, Irving quipped, “I'm guessing this isn't the essay you wrote for your admission here.”
But despite his joke, Irving did proceed to meditate on the novel’s weighty sexual themes. “It's easy to see what it's about,” he maintained, “It was a novel I wrote in the late 1970s, when the so-called Sexual Revolution and the so-called Gay Revolution, the Stonewall Riots, were happening. This is a post-revolution novel, and yet it's about sexual hatred. There are still people who hate you for your sexual differences.”
Irving then turned to a preview of his current project: a novel written from the viewpoint of a bisexual boy who recalls his experiences growing up during the 1950s and 1960s. The selection he chose to read tells of the narrator's junior year spent studying abroad in Vienna, during which time he worked as a waiter and shared a relationship with an American girl trying to become a professional opera singer.
Reading in a soft, slightly gravelly and sporadically animated voice, Irving brought to life the thoughts and feelings of a sexually-charged adolescent enjoying his first voyage abroad. As is characteristic of his novels, the story introduced several highly sexual elements, which heightened in intensity until one scene's graphic detail and simultaneous humor drew a laugh from the entire audience.
The evening’s tone was, like one of Irving’s novels, strange if humorous. Unable to refrain from smiling during his brief mention of a fight Irving once had with a porcupine in snowy Vermont, Johnston's light-hearted introduction fit well with Irving's decidedly strange brand of humor. Indeed, when Irving took the podium to begin his lecture, he took evident delight in the occasionally bizarre queries of his fans, such as whether or not he owns his own bear costume—bears being a recurring theme in his work. Deadpanning, he replied, “No. I don't even have a rental costume.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, California  State University prohibited students from buying and selling lecture notes online in light of NoteUtopia, a new website created for this purpose. Their decision is the correct one. The practice of trading class notes does not reflect the purpose of education and should be discouraged. Although proponents of this activity claim that the ban violates free speech, they should acknowledge it is entirely within an institution’s remit to control the distribution of lecture material as it sees fit.
The sale of notes no doubt disadvantages students with lower economic status, giving such students weakened resources to compete fairly with their peers. Most students also already pay a considerable fee, in the form of tuition, to access this material and should use the opportunity to receive this information first-hand in lecture.
Students will likely try to get around the recent cease-and-desist order that Cal  State sent to NoteUtopia by simply exchanging material for free on the web, helping their peers with the hope of receiving information in return. However, while such acts may seem altruistic at first glance, giving away the work of another person (i.e. their professor) is not. In our experience, notes taken during class often amount to a carbon copy of the given lecture. Frequently, student notes are in fact the only recorded documentation of a professor’s argument as articulated in class. This intellectual property, especially when it references a professor’s unpublished research, may very well not be publicly available otherwise. Students who simply listened to a lecture, and likely copied parts of it verbatim, should respect the professors’ right to control the distribution of these ideas.
Limiting note sharing also serves students who otherwise may find themselves relying on a peer’s potentially inaccurate representation of the material. In our experience, class notes often contain unintended factual or interpretive errors; limiting the spread of erroneous work would be a net-positive for everyone involved.
Above all, universities set themselves the dual goals of facilitating research and helping students to learn. Discouraging the dissemination of class material between students furthers both of these aims by protecting professors’ work and compelling students to actually come to class. If professors or an administration have no objection to the exchange of lecture notes, then they are of course free to say so. But this decision is theirs alone to make.

What do traveling, architecture, and breakfast places all have in common? According to a popular website, they are all “stuff white people like.” Immediately, this assertion seems to both make sense and make no sense at all. Certainly there are many white people who enjoy these things, and someone you know who is white may have a passion for one item in particular. It is possible to run through the entire list, with over 100 items, and think of a white person who likes each thing, from pea coats (#111), the Ivy League (#98), to even bottles of water (#76). However, although this blog’s main purpose is humor, its homogenizing of white people and conflation of whiteness with affluence creates negative stereotypes and adds baseless connotations to widely done activities.
Some of the site’s listings, which have now been compiled into two books, obviously have little to do with only white people—such as San Francisco (#91) and divorce (#66).  Many others, however, skew the perception of white people’s likes toward activities for the well off and successful.  Things like graduate school (#81), living by the water (#51), and expensive sandwiches (#63) denote both resources and academic success. This does not mean that there are not many white people who do like these things, but labeling them as “white” things subtly makes them objects and activities that other races do not like. This past year, two of my African-American friends studied abroad, which is number 72 on the list, does that make them more white? Are they less African-American or black because they took part in or liked this activity? Built in to every item on this list lies not only the assertion of enjoyment by white people but also a dislike or less of an enjoyment by other races.
The defining characteristic of this blog is the differentiation of white people’s likes with other’s likes, as all definitions require separation from something else to exist. From this lens, this list states that other races enjoy the World Cup (#133), Bob Marley (#125), and free healthcare (#94) less than white people do. While this is not equivalent to outright racial slurs, the site’s indirect negative treatment of other races has a discriminatory effect.
The website and its spinoffs are, in fact, flawed and failed attempts at creating a unified “white culture.” While it is true that two people may describe themselves as white on a survey or job application, the unity that this characteristic holds is tiny. In the same way that thinking someone from the Gambia is the same as someone from Kenya, or that someone from Singapore is the same as someone from Vietnam, combining Americans of European descent together does more to ignore and cover culture than create it. Saying that white people like natural medicine (#59), for example, blocks out cultural differences among Italians and the Irish on this issue, providing a single unverified and ignorant claim.
Of course, Stuff White People Like is merely a website and two books, but perhaps the most troubling thing about it is the relatively benign status it maintains. Although packaged as a fun list, this type of social commentary reduces an entire race to an arbitrary and expensive set of activities, distances other races from academic and financial success, and neglects actual culture. It is the very sort of thing that most white people hate.

Moscow is the city in which I was born, and which I love with all my heart, but more for its people, history, and culture than its current state of affairs. Certain things that happen there these days tend to frighten me. Or should I say many?
In July and August the western part of Russia experienced 100-degree temperatures that caused massive fires. As a result, fumes and smoke filled the air and filled it completely—sitting inside one building in Moscow, it was impossible to see the next building over from the window. Square miles of forest disappeared daily as they were consumed by fires.
The government was completely unprepared to deal with the heat wave or fires to begin with and hardly did anything to improve the situation. So many people were dying of the heat and unbreathable air that funeral homes were not able to handle the huge quantities of corpses.
At the same time, the government did not permit doctors to diagnose the fumes as a cause of death. There is still a lack of openness and transparency in the system, just as in the old days.  A couple of weeks ago, there was an alarm in the media about the possibility of radioactive smoke in the air coming from the fires in regions around Chernobyl. It was also predicted that the main side effect of the fumes would be massive memory loss in two years, this as was mentioned on National Public Radio. Russian journalist Victor Shenderovich half-jokingly said that a massive memory loss will be very convenient for the government as the new elections approach and the same people are planning to stay in power.
And who did the official Russian press blame for these fires and all their consequences? Surprisingly, not the government, not the infrastructure of disaster management, and not even Mother Nature, but…drum roll, please…America!
According to a new urban legend, which is supported by mass media, American scientists have secretly and skillfully built a kind of astro-lab in the Russian sky, but they used such advanced technologies that no one in the country can now find it. Sort of like the Bush-era weapons of mass destruction. The quite mysterious lab in the sky where Americans are experimenting was supposedly the main cause of the rise in temperatures and therefore the fires and lethal smoke that followed, not to mention the tripled mortality rates and failure of the wheat and barley harvest that the drought brought on. It was all part of America’s massive secret plan.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin hasn’t been using phrases like “first we will locate them, and then we will find them” about the labs’ designers, but at the same time, it is to the government’s advantage to convince people that America has nothing to do with it. Part of the reason why the theory formed in the first place is that it was hard for citizens to face the fact that their government does not take good care of them. Or rather, that Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev don’t even try to.
Medvedev is seen as helpless and is widely nicknamed “Kinder Surprise” both on the streets and also by the press. There was even an article published with the title “Is Medvedev a President or a Kinder Surprise?”
Unlike Medvedev himself, a Kinder Surprise is something I highly approve of. It is a delicious German chocolate candy egg, made especially for kids (“kinder” is the German word for child). After you eat it, there’s a little plastic toy inside that pops out for the kid to play with. According to Muscovites, Medvedev was a surprising choice, who just “popped out” suddenly as president of their country, and yet they believe he could have been anyone, that is, anyone who was shorter than Putin and completely obedient to his wishes. Putin is now using Medvedev as a toy puppet.
As a counteraction to an overall sense of loss of control, Russia has witnessed a swift rise in nationalism, and the Russian press resorts to targeting the United States as the scapegoat. Many Americans aren’t aware of it, and there is no way that they can be, because the view is held by the Russians living there rather than by the ones who have immigrated here.
Regardless of the extent of the crisis or natural disaster, I think it is important for a nation not to search for scapegoats or imagine conspiracy theories but rather to look within itself and take full responsibility for its own actions, even for the surprises in store.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Saturday, numb from an afternoon spent in Lamont, I agreed to accompany a friend to an evening screening of “The Social Network.” It was, admittedly, a reluctant assent. Facebook and I have long maintained a love-hate relationship: Lately, strained by an onslaught of fake friend requests—all with foreign names and porn-star-worthy physiques—it’s tended toward the latter. The prospect of willingly watching my perennial, and much resented, time-suck blown-up and bloated on the big screen was, needless to say, unattractive.
Yet, five hours privy to the ambient rhythm of other people’s productivity—pages turning, mousepads clicking, keyboards pounding with purpose—had weakened my resolve. My midday caffeine-high nearing a critical low, the hype began to sound more and more convincing: Maybe Aaron Sorkin’s pet project really was the next “Citizen Kane.” Never mind the overwrought trailer or Justin Timberlake’s 'N Sync-era curls: Two-hours of Hollywood-induced escapism was doctor’s orders.
Maybe it was my impossible polyester chair, seeped in competing odors of fake butter and orange soda, or the running commentary of the prepubescent gaggle to my right. But the movie—this season’s undoubted critical darling—left me underwhelmed, irked even. For all of its attention to Harvard’s idiosyncrasies—the white-walled aesthetics of River house dorms, the throw-back Quincy House website, the lack of “business” majors—the university it depicted bore comically scant resemblance to the one I currently attended. Rather than offering a nuanced portrayal of social life under the Crimson, the film reduced Harvard to the palest of stereotypes. Here was the marginalized, unscrupulous Jew outwitting the über-entitled WASP upper-class, who (predictably) turned to “Daddy” for backup. The Winklevosses were exemplars of the white-male establishment: aggressively aristocratic “gentlemen of Harvard” with square-jaws and J. Press sportcoats. Zuckerberg was a petulant, vengeful Shylock, reincarnated for the digital era: This time, he got his pound of flesh—and the blood to boot. Hadn’t I heard this story before?
Worse than the film’s classist and religious clichés was its depiction of Harvard women—most of whom, oddly enough, were Asian. Take, for example, Christy, a promiscuous co-ed gleaned from Orientalist lore. The film features Christy in three modes: sexual fetish, bathroom-stall blowjob dispenser, and crazed pyromaniac-bitch—each of which seem decidedly extraneous to the film’s plot. Discounting Christie’s equally indiscriminate sidekick, Alice, all of the film’s memorable females hail from somewhere other than Harvard. Busload of busty, Ecstasy-equipped models? Check. Lithe Stanford gamine? Check. Painfully insipid, Silicon-Valley couch surfers? Double check. Harvard men—or, at least, an elite subset of them—may have the prerogative to party, but Harvard’s women, it seems, aren’t either hot or uninhibited enough to make it past the bouncer.
Grilling Sorkin about “the ladies in the film,” Stephen Colbert cut straight to the point: excepting Erica Albright, Zuckerberg’s “super smart” ex-girlfriend, the script lacks “women of substance”—they’re all too busy getting drunk, taking hits, and putting various things in their mouths to get a word in edgewise. This despite the fact that Harvard houses some of the most accomplished female students and scholars in the world. Bumbling his response, Sorkin noted “one other” unfrivolous woman—Rashida L. Jones '97, herself a Harvard alumna—and proceeded to class the rest of the film’s females as “prizes”: circulating sex-objects that can be bought with enough money, power, or social prestige. He trailed his insight with a self-exculpating addendum: “It [the film] really doesn’t speak to the entire female population of Harvard, this is just the people who are populating this story.” So, all Harvard men save for computer science concentrators and final club members view women as more than walking vaginas? Thanks Sorkin, I was worried for a second!
At least to current Harvard students, “The Social Network’s” repeated scenes of intoxicated depravity—culled from some “Animal-House”-meets-hip-New-York-club wet dream—serve as a not-so-subtle disclosure that Sorkin’s narrative attends more to fiction than fact. This Sorkin readily admits: as he stated in an interview with New York Magazine, “I don’t want my fidelity to be to the truth; I want it to be to storytelling”—a confession which still has Zuckerberg’s defenders fuming. Erotic imaginings aside, what Sorkin delivers is an overly-literalist reading of everything an outsider might think Harvard would be: a bastion of old-boy entitlement and self-indulgent seersucker—“Mad Men” stripped of everyone over twenty-two. Thirty-odd years of affirmative action be damned: Sorkin wants his bike room with bikes in it.
Hollywood’s penchant for stereotypes—be they gender, class, faith, or race-based—comes as no surprise. Fiction, moreover, is certainly within Sorkin’s right: Few would argue that every film based on a real-world personage need be documentary. At issue, ultimately, is not so much whether the film is fact or fantastic projection—that is clear enough—but why a narrative so comically trite has been so widely hailed as the “defining” parable of our generation. Is the zeitgeist of today’s twenty-somethings really encapsulated by an interrogation, as New   York puts it, of the various modalities of asshole-dom?
Facebook is a compelling phenomenon, one that seems to uniquely sum up and judge postmodern existence. Yet, if critics want a commentary on being-in-the-digital-age, they should look to the website itself, not Sorkin’s gratuitous origin myth. Ten minutes spent scanning through strangers’ forgotten albums yields more about us moderns’ uniquely alienated, painfully self-conscious existence than Sorkin’s flattened film manages in one-hundred-twenty.

A nationwide survey administered by the Institute of Politics found a decrease in young voters’ participation in and enthusiasm for the upcoming midterm election.
The results of the web-based poll, released yesterday, were based on 2,004 responses collected from young adults between the ages of 18 and 29.
Conducted from Sept. 24 to Oct. 4, the survey revealed that only 18 percent of the age group—dubbed the Millennial generation—consider themselves to be politically active and engaged. This represents a six percent drop from an IOP poll conducted eleven months ago.
“We’re trying to reach out to other political groups on campus, talking about how to get the Millennial generation involved,” said Eric Lu ’12, who helped create the survey.
During a conference call yesterday morning, IOP Director of Polling John Della Volpe said he found declining interest in political participation among young people surprising.
“Several times we’ve seen an increase in political participation as an election draws near,” Della Volpe said. “I was surprised by the drop of activity levels of this generation.”
The survey found that 27 percent of Millennials said they would ‘definitively be voting’ in the upcoming election—a nine percent decrease from those planning to vote 11 months ago.
This decrease did not apply to those enrolled in a four-year college, where about 35 percent of students plan to vote in the upcoming election—about the same number that pledged to do so in a 2006 survey.
The findings also showed that the majority of Millennials continue to support a Democrat-controlled Congress, though their approval of President Obama has waned. Overall, 49 percent of Millennials polled approve of the current presidency.
Lillian A. Nottingham ’13, another student involved in creating the survey, said she thought the change in attitude sprung from unmet expectations of the 2008 presidential election.
“In 2008 the change Obama talked about was extreme change,” Nottingham said. “Although he has pushed efforts with health care reform, that’s change that hasn’t affected the majority of 18 to 29 year olds,” she said.
The IOP also polled young adults’ views on the Dream Act, former President Bush’s 2001 tax cuts, and other hot-button issues.

Bruce M. Alberts ’60, editor-in-chief of Science magazine and past president of the National Academy of Science, called for a cultural change in science education during a packed lecture in Sever Hall yesterday.
According to Alberts, the main issue in science education is that elementary and high school students are taught to simply memorize and recall facts instead of thinking critically about scientific problems.
During his tenure as President of the National Academy of Science, Alberts played a major role in developing the National Science Education Standards, designed to emphasize inquiry-based education to foster effective problem-solving skills applicable in the workplace and in life. However, as Alberts noted, states were allowed to produce their own set of educational standards and consequently “paid little attention” to the standards. The results, he said, are inconsistent learning standards across the nation which persist today.
Prevailing learning formats and pre-medical school course requirements stand in the way of reinventing science education, Alberts said.
Some audience members said they agreed with Alberts’s critique.
“To delve into one discipline, explore and learn and understand it, you have to feel like you’re not going to be screwed because you’re not going to get an 800 on the SAT biology,” said John J. Clore, a Harvard Graduate School of Education student who attended the talk.
To effect change, institutions should undertake in-depth research about education and implement an inquiry-based teaching method, Alberts said. This cultural movement—which Alberts said is of “highest priority”—must be initiated by colleges, which can then affect high schools and elementary schools. Alberts called on Harvard in particular to initiate this change, saying that the University is “synonymous with education excellence.”
Alberts has experience as an innovator in education, according to University President Drew G. Faust, who introduced the talk and noted Albert’s integral role during his time on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, “prodding us to think more assertively and ambitiously about undergraduate education in science, and to break down boundaries between schools and disciplines.”
“When you’re dealing with all these different groups of people with different interests, getting to work in one direction isn’t easy, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try,” Harvard Professor Irwin I. Shapiro, another audience member, said.

Adolescent illiteracy is a lingering crisis in America, according to Donald Deshler, director of the Center for Research on Learning at the University of Kansas School of Education.
To address this issue, Deshler proposed integrated teaching solutions to improve literacy in this population at the sixth annual Jeanne S. Chall Lecture at the Graduate School of Education yesterday.
Deshler began by showing a video of a teenager named Marcus struggling to read aloud an excerpt from a novel, pausing to sound out words, trying different pronunciations, and hesitating at words like “dinner” and “dining” in which the spelling of the stem has changed.
To improve the reading skills of students like Marcus, Deshler and his team conducted the extended reading opportunities studies, which assessed the effectiveness of a supplementary reading class in secondary schools.
The study results were disappointing, Deshler said.
The supplemental reading class had no effect on students’ vocabulary level, the number of credits they earned in high school, or their GPAs.
“To bring our methods up to where they need to be, we need a better mousetrap,” Deshler said.
“One teacher cannot be solely responsible for literacy.  The entire school must be invested in the problem.”
Deshler proposed that history, science, and English teachers should all integrate reading strategies into their classes so that literacy skills are constantly reinforced.
“These teachers are working in horrid conditions, but belief in the students motivates them. They are heroes,” he said.
Lori L. DiGisi, president of the Massachusetts Reading Association and a member of the audience, said that while new initiatives must always be based on data, they may be born of anecdotes from students.
Expanding upon Deshler’s integrated solutions, DiGisi suggested that foreign language books be made available in public libraries to encourage literary discussion between students and parents from international backgrounds.

Ronald M. Shaich, co-founder and CEO of Panera Bread, described his vision to break partisan political gridlock through a new advocacy group, No Labels, at an event hosted by the Institute of Politics yesterday.
Shaich told the audience of about 40 assembled in the Lowell Junior Common Room that American politics have devolved into an unproductive ideological war that does not allow for pragmatism or compromise.
“Ultimately, unless we get rid of some of our ideological intensity, we are not going to be served by government,” he said.
Among other things, No Labels intends to create space for moderate voices in the political conversation.
Shaich said the group will also advocate for open primaries—in which any voter, regardless of party affiliation, can vote—and neutral redistricting processes, and that he envisions one day forming a No Labels Political Action Committee to help fund the campaigns of moderate politicians.
The group plans to launch formally at a rally on Dec. 13 at Columbia University, which they anticipate will draw over 1,000 attendees.
According to Kevin Walling, a field director for No Labels who also spoke yesterday, the group hopes to eventually enlist one million members.
He urged those in attendance to publicize the group via Facebook and other social networking venues.
Farha A. Faisal ’12, who organized the event, said the group is important because many college students do not subscribe to specific political labels and would benefit from learning about the other political options available to them.
“What’s most important is serving the American people in the best way, and that’s what No Labels is all about,” she said.
Some audience members said they found that message appealing.
“I think this represents what I would hope the future of American politics will be,” said Benjamin S. Raderstorf ’14, who attended the event.
But not all audience members were taken with Shaichs’s message.
“Disagreeing about things is human nature—it’s the nature of politics,” said David Lee, a high school senior from North Carolina who was in the audience.

CORRECTION: October 23, 2010

Sean D. Kelly, chair of Harvard’s philosophy department, believes philosophers ought to pose the question of how to live a good life to people who “are busy living”—not just to those reading Friedrich Nietzsche in the Ivory Tower.
“From the freshmen who come into the Gen Ed course I teach, to the surgeon in the middle of his career, I think that almost everyone faces questions about what they ought to be aspiring to,” Kelly says. “It’s one characteristic of the secular age. We’re faced with these questions in a way that people living in other ages weren’t.”
According to Kelly, during the “secular age” public discourse has been infused with nihilism, which maintains that life is devoid of meaning and purpose.
In order to challenge this nihilism, Kelly and his former dissertation advisor, Hubert L. Dreyfus ’51 of the University of California at Berkeley, have co-written a book to be released in January 2011, “All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age.”
CAN TECHNOLOGY OVERCOME NIHILISM?
The book, to be published by Simon & Schuster’s Free Press imprint, is not intended to be an academic title with a limited press run. According to Kelly, he and Dreyfus wrote it with a mass audience in mind because they are concerned that the idea that life is meaningless has spread widely in contemporary culture.
“This [book] is really meant to combat that development from within by revealing to people the meanings that are already in their lives that they’re covering up,” Kelly says. “The project needs mass appeal because if not, the nihilistic stuff could become the seed around which the understanding of our age could grow.”
Dreyfus says that he and Kelly chose to explore philosophical themes in literature from Homer to Herman Melville to David Foster Wallace to “help rediscover a way of life in which things really do matter, in which people take risks and really do commit themselves.”
Dreyfus fears that these themes are being lost in the age of new media. “The main point,” he says, “is that nothing is supporting serious commitments, whereas all sorts of things like Facebook have taken the seriousness and aliveness out of people’s interaction.”
The phenomenon of texting also poses a challenge to the meaningful life, Dreyfus says. “I’m amazed at how young people prefer texting to talking,” he says. “Why are they texting? Again, lack of commitment—when you’re texting, you don’t have to make a spontaneous response. When [communication] is ‘safe,’ it becomes meaningless and boring and sad and so forth.”
Despite the effects of technology has on human interaction, Kelly and Dreyfus both acknowledge its potential to expand their audience and convey their message.
Their book deal grew out of a series of Dreyfus’s podcasted lectures, which introduced his ideas to an untapped global market of people interested in philosophy. He says that Alaskan fishermen and trans-continental truck drivers called to request the syllabi from his courses in order to follow along with the podcasts.
Eventually, Hilary Redmon, senior editor at Simon & Schuster, suggested that Kelly and Dreyfus turn these lectures into a book.
“We’re not an academic publisher,” she says, “but I do think it’s important to publish books that are speaking not just to interscholastic debates but are speaking intelligently and articulately about questions that anyone on the street could have.”
Pointing to the recent successes of books by authors Alain de Botton and Yale’s Harold Bloom, Redmon argued that there is a market for philosophical writing.
NEW MEDIA, NEW ACCESSIBILITY
But others, such as The New School’s Simon Critchley, who moderates The New York Times philosophy blog “The Stone,” maintain that this craving for popular philosophy is better satisfied by new media rather than books.
“There’s a hunger for serious intellectual discussion, but done in a non-technical way,” Critchley says. “People aren’t necessarily going to go to a bookstore and buy a book anymore, but they can read a 1,000-word column.”
Of the top 20 most e-mailed New York Times op-ed pieces in the last six months, Critchley said that five or six have come from The Stone. He said that one explanation is the “dialogic” interactive capacity of new media that allows readers to participate in the conversation.
“It means for professional philosophers that there’s a huge interest in what they do, but that there’s also little toleration for the abstruseness of most academic discussions,” he says.
Still, Critchley shares Kelly’s and Dreyfus’ concern with the tendency of new media to promote the idea that modern life is void of meaning.
“The problem that Kelly and Dreyfus have identified is exactly the right one,” he says, “and Homer and Melville are exactly what need to be gone back to.”
For Critchley, new media forms are thus “a double-edged sword” that make it rare for people to read entire novels but that also make public conversations possible. Ultimately, though, he says these innovations are good for philosophy.
Kelly, who plans to begin contributing to “The Stone,” says that, in the age of new media, philosophers must rise to the challenge of communicating in a more accessible way.
“There’s an audience for people who are thinking seriously about philosophical questions related to living a life,” he says.
“That encourages philosophers to write in such a way that’s not laden with technical terms. That’s a totally legitimate challenge for our generation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several administrators within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences said that they believe the new undergraduate concentration in biomedical engineering will attract a large number of students—some of whom might not have otherwise chosen to major within SEAS—when sophomores declare their concentrations next month.
While no administrator could offer an official projection for the number of concentrators, SEAS Assistant Dean for Academic Programs Marie Dahleh said she believes the new concentration will be a “popular option” because it will meet “many if not all of the premed requirements, and also has an interesting curriculum to supplement the course load for those interested medical school.”
Dahleh also said that she believes the new concentration will draw a broad array of students, including those who might have otherwise chosen one of the six biology concentrations offered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
“We are working under the hypothesis that by having this concentration as a new freestanding concentration, students who may not have looked at engineering for their concentration will now consider doing bioengineering instead of one of the life sciences concentrations,” Dahleh said.
Professor Robert D. Howe, co-director of Undergraduate Study for Biomedical Engineering echoed Dahleh’s view.
Howe said he had encountered a “pleasing and surprising number of students [with backgrounds in the] life sciences” who are interested in the new concentration and have the “backgrounds and the math necessary to take bioengineering classes.”
If the concentration does indeed draw students to SEAS who might otherwise have chosen a major offered by FAS, the number of SEAS concentrators will continue its recent trend of expansion.
The number of students concentrating within SEAS has expanded rapidly over the past two years, jumping from 299 in spring 2008 to 415 last spring.
The program in biomedical engineering—which was announced last March and became an official offering this past fall—has so far netted three concentrators: two from the class of 2012 and one from the class of 2011.
Before the creation of the new concentration, students were only allowed to choose a biomedical sciences and engineering “track” within a more general engineering sciences concentration.
According to Dahleh, biomedical sciences and engineering has historically been the most popular track within the engineering sciences concentration, drawing in roughly 40 percent of undergraduate engineers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Committee on African Studies held a reception last night to celebrate Harvard’s expanding commitment to African and African-American studies.
“Africa in Motion”—a two-day event co-sponsored by the Du Bois Institute that includes an all-day symposium today—seeks to highlight new opportunities and engagements for the University and its partners in Africa.
More than 700 people attended the reception last night, according to Chair of the Standing Committee on African Studies Caroline Elkins, who organized the event.
Among the guests at the event, which was held at The Laboratory at Harvard, were University President Drew G. Faust, Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, and Professor Henry L. “Skip” Gates, Jr.
In her remarks to the reception’s attendees, Faust referred to the current moment as a “celebration of opportunities that lie ahead.”
“Together, we can be so much more,” Faust said.
The Lab was littered with booths that showcased various projects and programs in African Studies. A large map of Africa was painted on the floor of the entrance to the forum, and all guests were invited to sign their names in the countries that they had visited or wanted to visit.
Several guests looked on as Faust signed her name in both South Africa and Botswana. In 2009, Faust became the second University president to visit the continent while in office.
“It feels like there’s a growing tide toward Africa,” said Kali N. Ilunga, who attended the event. “We’re getting attention in a really positive way.”
Allistair M. Witten, an alumnus of the Harvard Graduate School of Education and a former Harvard South Africa Fellow, said that the reception exemplified an expanding focus for the African Studies department—from the involvement of faculty across different schools to the variety of projects demonstrating cross-campus collaboration.
“We are thrilled by the kind of relations, connections between Harvard and Africa that continue to grow,” Witten said.
Elkins said she was pleased that the guests of last night’s reception had come from many different schools of the University. For many, this was the first glimpse of the department’s expansion in recent years.
“People need to see it, interact with it, and experience it,” Elkins said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Education designated the Committee on African Studies as a National Resource Center, an honor which will bring with it $2.5 million in grants over the next four years.
The day-long symposium is taking place today and will feature panels and discussions about University-wide collaborations with African Studies.

CORRECTION: MAR. 28, 2011
The Oct. 22, 2010 article "Event Honors Growth in Africa" incorrectly stated that University President Drew G. Faust was the first Harvard president to visit the African continent. In fact, former University President Derek C. Bok first visited Africa on a trip in 1975.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On paper, the number of burglaries at Harvard’s Cambridge campus plummeted 91 percent last year, but the decline had more to do with policy in Washington than safety in Cambridge.
A national change in the definition of burglary used for campus crime reporting led the Harvard University Police Department to narrow its categorization of this type of crime. The resulting drop, from 230 reported instances of on-campus burglary in 2008 to 21 in 2009, put the statistic in line with the rest of the Ivy League.
Now, HUPD, as well as campus police departments across the country, must find evidence of trespassing in order to categorize a crime as a burglary, a standard akin to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Reporting standards. Otherwise, the crime would be categorized as a larceny.
Larceny, unlike burglary, is not required to be reported under the Clery Act, a law that mandates yearly disclosures of campus crime statistics.
Prior to the change, universities were instructed to default to the burglary classification, unless evidence suggested an incident was a larceny.
Categorizing thefts as burglaries or larcenies has long been contentious, for HUPD as well as for other university police departments.
“There’s been a lot of controversy in the higher education and law enforcement fields in how to report burglary,” said S. Daniel Carter, director of public policy at Security on Campus, an organization that advocates for transparency in campus crime reporting.
At Harvard, that controversy dates back at least to 2000, when then-HUPD associate director Kevin W. Regan wrote a letter to the Department of Education seeking clarification on the definition of burglary and comparing Harvard’s dramatically higher burglary numbers to those of other Ivy League schools.
“As you can easily see, it appears that our report has us out on an island in comparison to other Universities,” Regan, who is now HUPD deputy chief, wrote.
Despite Regan’s letter, the controversy remained unresolved, with Harvard adhering to a wider definition of burglary than many other schools.
“There’s absolutely no question that there’s been inconsistent applications of Clery definitions and guidelines by schools across the country,” Carter said.
The classification of thefts was among those discrepancies, with “a definite preference to default to the less inclusive definition,” which was larceny, according to Carter.
“It was technically a violation of the act,” he said.
In 2005, the Department of Education issued a handbook that explained crime reporting requirements for universities. In its definition of burglary, the handbook stated that if the police do not have evidence that suggests a larceny took place, the crime should be classified as a burglary.
Since then, Harvard’s burglary incidence outpaced its peers. For example, in 2007, Harvard reported 259 incidents of burglary on its Cambridge campus, while Columbia’s Morningside campus had 112 reports and the University of Pennsylvania’s Main Campus had 41.
HUPD approached both Security on Campus and Harvard’s Office of Federal Relations several years ago to lobby for the inclusion of larcenies on Clery Act reports “as a more transparent way to accurately portray property crime on campus,” according to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano.
But Suzanne Day, Harvard’s director of federal relations, wrote in an e-mail that “the crime definitions were not a particular issue for us in Washington.”
Though HUPD advocated for the inclusion of larcenies, the federal government amended the Clery Act to the opposite effect, requiring evidence of unlawful entry for the categorization of burglary.
Despite its advocacy, HUPD complied with the change. The number of on-campus burglaries—which, in 2009, would have been 245 under the previous definition—was reported as 21, in compliance with the new criteria.
The sharp decline provides a narrower portrayal of property crime at Harvard than the previous standard, but Carter, while calling the change ”somewhat troubling,” said that it allows for campus crime definitions to conform to ones used by local police departments.
“I think it’s unfortunate that the numbers are not as inclusive, but it is consistent with the national definition,” Carter said. “So it’s frustrating to us because it’s less inclusive, but at the same time, we recognize that it’s consistent with what every city and town is reporting.”

Louis Henkin, a constitutional law scholar who helped found the field of human rights law, died last week. He was 92.
Henkin, a 1940 graduate of Harvard Law School, founded Columbia’s Center for the Study of Human Rights in 1978 and the Human Rights Institute in 1998.
His writings on foreign affairs, constitutional law, and human rights law became foundational texts for law students and government officials alike.
His son Josh H. Henkin ’87 remembers his father’s humility and discipline in his work.
“Everything I know about my father’s accomplishments I know from someone else,” Henkin said. “He was a deeply modest man.”
Josh Henkin said that his father rarely talked about his work with family or friends.
“I think a lot of people knew him only as the kindly old man at synagogue. Or the doorman knew him as the guy who always said ‘hello.’ But he actually had this clandestine life as a human rights scholar.”
Henkin’s “clandestine life” included clerkships for judges on a federal appellate court and on the Supreme Court, and a storied career in the State Department in the Office of Regional Affairs.
As a professor of law he taught hundreds of judges, including Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer, and Sonia Sotomayor.
“Henkin’s tireless scholarship, advocacy, and teaching changed not only law and government behavior, but also how people around the world understand the dignity of every person,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release.
Henkin applied to Law School on a whim after graduating from Yeshiva College, his son said.
Previously he had pursued math—an interest since childhood—and may have considered becoming a math professor.
According to his son, when five-year-old Henkin arrived at Ellis Island with his family in 1923 after immigrating from Belarus, he refused to answer the questions of the immigration officials. In an effort to coax him to speak, his father asked Henkin a math problem. Henkin answered the question and the family was allowed the enter the United States.
Josh Henkin said he remembers that while studying for the SAT, his father would bring home lists of words that he had encountered that day at Columbia Law School—often legal jargon—for Josh to practice.
“Never in the history of the SAT would those words ever appear,” Josh said. “I spent a lot of my childhood being taken to the dictionary by my father.”
Henkin wrote many articles and widely-cited books including “Foreign Affairs and the Constitution,” “The Rights of Man Today,” “How Nations Behave” and “The Age of Rights.”
Law School Professor Gerald L. Neuman ’73, Henkin’s former colleague who was elected last month to the United Nation’s Human Rights Committee, said: “Louis Henkin was a giant in the fields of constitutional law and international relations. He was also a uniquely gifted advocate and recruiter for the cause of human rights.”

Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh delivered a grim forecast on the state of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and President Obama’s foreign policy prospects, yesterday at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Hersh, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1970 for exposing the My Lai massacre in Vietnam, spoke as part of a lecture series on American foreign policy.
Currently working on a book on the foreign policy of the George W. Bush (or as Hersh refers to it, Cheney) administration, Hersh began by critiquing former President George W. Bush’s strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan.
He highlighted differences between Bush and Obama’s styles, saying, “[Obama] cares about words. What drove me crazy about Bush is that words meant nothing to him.”
Through a series of personal anecdotes, Hersh said that especially after 9/11, any adviser who voiced doubts about the progress of the war in Iraq was promptly dismissed.
He said the media was responsible for what he called a total failure to act as watchdogs in what he characterized as a systematic silencing of dissenting voices.
In the second half of his talk, however, Hersh said that in their handling of foreign policy, and especially the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the two presidents have been remarkably similar.
While many were expecting President Obama to dramatically change the U.S.’s foreign policy positions, Hersh said, his administration has instead kept the same personnel and adopted the same policies that were implemented under the previous administration.
Hersh attributed what he deemed Obama’s failure to take a new direction to pressure from the military to escalate the war effort in Afghanistan, and racist undercurrents in the armed forces.
“We have a president of the United States who refuses to be a Commander-in-Chief,” he said.
The lecture ended with Hersh’s sobering outlook on the status of our national security.
“We are in a very perilous moment because we are increasingly disliked,” Hersh said.

More than any other sporting event at Harvard, the Head of the Charles has come to embody the tradition, the prestige, and the permanence of what it means to be a Harvard athlete.
After 46 years, the regatta has not only served as an intersection for much of the rowing world, as nearly 8,000 athletes from across the globe descend on Cambridge every fall, but it has also come to serve as a crossroad for Harvard’s past, present, and, ultimately, future.
In an event that has become a familiar occurrence at the Head of the Charles—the Alumnae Eight race—the 2010 Radcliffe crew will witness its predecessors man their boats once more in a race down the Charles.
The alumnae will be represented by two teams; one team will be composed of nine alumnae who have graduated within the last 10 years, while a second team will be composed of nine senior alumnae, all of whom are 50 to 70 years old.
And in what promises to be an exciting race, former Radcliffe rowers will once again chase their own records and some of their old competitors down the 3.1-mile course on the Charles.
For many of the alumnae participating in tomorrow’s race, the Head of the Charles serves as a continuation of a lifetime of crew. Some former athletes have added to their Radcliffe crew legacies by taking their talents to the Olympic level, while others have also had their post-collegiate experiences shaped by crew in one way or another.
The experiences of individuals such as Nelia Newell ’79, who rowed for Radcliffe and is the mother of captain Will Newell and sophomore Alex Newell—both members of the lightweight men’s team—reinforce the lasting effect Radcliffe crew has on its athletes. For Newell, crew has not only become a familiar part of her personal life through her two sons, it has become a central facet in her professional life as well. After graduation, Newell took up a position as crew coach for the Winsor School, an all-girls’ private high school in Boston. But this weekend, the talented alumna is ready to get back on the water herself.
“First of all, you’re like, ‘30 years disappears, this is great!’,” Newell says. “Then about six strokes later, you’re like, ‘What in the world do I think I’m doing?’ It’s fun. This is also great when you’re coaching high school kids, because it’s something they can look at and go, ‘Oh, my coach still races, my parents still race, this isn’t just something for high school or college kids, this is a sport for life. Being an athlete isn’t something that ends when you’re 25.’”
While many of the alumnae racing this weekend may not have taken crew into their professional careers, the Alumnae Eight race will still have additional meaning to them.
“The Head of the Charles is a really unique race, at least for the rowing community,” says Radcliffe crew alumna Sarah Moore ’09. “It’s all about the thrill of competition, but for us graduates, it is as much, if not more, of a reunion than a race. This is the one big race that pretty much everyone makes an effort to come back, and for me, it will be just [as much] about seeing former teammates and friends as it will be about 3.1 miles of rowing.”
The tight-knit camaraderie that rowing fosters among past and present members of Radcliffe crew has also created a strong level of support and involvement among the crew alumnae network.
Despite being spread out throughout the country and the world, many within the Black and White community manage to find ways to help and pay back financially.
“There is a proud tradition in being an alumna of the Radcliffe crew programs,” Moore says. “I think the Radcliffe alumnae are very interested in keeping track of how the current team is doing, because it’s such a part of your life when you are in school...We benefited so much from the largesse of the alumnae in my years. They paid for the trips to Florida every year, which allowed us to get out of Boston and get in some rowing time. So when you become an alumna yourself, that’s something that you think about a lot, giving back to the program.”
As another Head of the Charles regatta nears, and athletes and alumnae alike prepare once more for another race through Cambridge, what remains striking to many of them is the seemingly fleeting nature of time.
“All of a sudden, you’re rowing behind the same person you rowed behind four years in college, and it’s fun,” Newell says. “You don’t really train for it. But you get up onto the starting line with your black and white oars, and you’re coming up to the BU [boathouse] with the starter saying, ‘Radcliffe, you’re on the course.’ And it’s like 30 years disappears.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Had a certain freshman roommate not been so persistent three years ago, the fate of Radcliffe crew could have been entirely different. Not only would the second lightweight varsity boat be one woman short, but more importantly, the team would have also been without one of its biggest assets: the leadership of co-captain Leah Schwartz.
“My freshman roommate decided she was interested in rowing and decided to drag me along to the interest meeting,” Schwartz says. “She quit after five days...I didn’t. It was a total whim.”
A former walk-on, Schwartz was elected co-captain of the Black and White by her peers last spring, along with teammate Natalie Wong, and is eagerly anticipating her return to her fourth and final Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend in her new commanding role.
Although Schwartz’s Radcliffe experience began akin to many other inexperienced Harvard women, it is exceedingly rare that a walk-on is eventually elected captain for her senior year. In fact, none of the Black and White captains in at least the past four years have been former walk-ons.
According to Wong, Schwartz is an exception to the average walk-on.
“It’s a huge testament that she’s one of two walk-ons left from her class,” Wong says. “She’s really dedicated herself to rowing for the past four years.”
Schwartz started out as a casual competitor, but, like most varsity rowers, soon found the sport to be addicting.
“A lot of it was inertia, liking it enough to keep coming back every day,” Schwartz says. “The routine became a big part of my life at Harvard. It was a huge challenge, and I looked forward to trying to get better every day on the water.”
This inertia helped Schwartz remain a committed rower for the past three years, and yet, because of an injury last season, she may still seem like a wild card to competitors. Schwartz suffered a stress fracture of the rib, forcing her to watch her teammates from the dock all last spring.
According to Schwartz, she strived to remain committed to the team, and as a result, ultimately earned Radcliffe’s respect by being elected captain.
“The hardest part was [making] sure that the team knew that I wasn’t quitting or giving up,” Schwartz says. “I wanted to do everything I could from the sidelines to make sure our boats were going to go fast. I never let myself check out mentally, I never let myself think that going to practice in the afternoon was optional, and I hope that was clear.”
But last season was not the first time in Schwartz’s brief rowing career that an injury kept her out of the boat for an extended period of time. In fact, it was a similar stress fracture to a separate rib during her sophomore fall that left Schwartz ineligible for an entire month.
Despite the setback, the co-captain managed to find the silver lining in the situation.
“The moment I realized I was going to stick with [crew] was after the first time I got injured and came back,” Schwartz says. “I realized that if I can take time off and come back and still love it, then this sport must really be worth doing. I missed it after only about four weeks.”
It may have been this same sense of optimism that helped Schwartz gain respect as co-captain, and it certainly helps her set high goals for the Black and White.
“In my three years here, we’ve always done as expected and never exceeded expectations, but this year, I think we’re really going to blow people out of the water [in this weekend’s regatta],” Schwartz says.
The Head of the Charles is not only important to Schwartz because of the opportunities it presents for her team, but also because it signifies one of Schwartz’s proudest individual accomplishments.
“There’s one thing I can say: for all my injuries and moving in and out of my boats, I’ve been able to say I’ve raced in every single Head of the Charles [since my freshman year],” Schwartz says.
After graduation, Schwartz, a social studies concentrator, has a job waiting for her in the investment banking division of Goldman Sachs, where she interned this summer. She believes her involvement in crew was a key aspect of the firm’s interest in her.
“There’s no question, the leadership opportunities with rowing have been amazing preparation for working with teams in the future,” Schwartz says. “[Crew] has taught me a lot about how to lead as a vocal leader and lead by example, which are both valuable skills.”
While Schwartz may have her freshman roommate to thank for spurring her initial interest in Radcliffe crew, Goldman Sachs similarly may have Radcliffe crew to thank for its latest hire, because without the skills instilled in her by her rowing experience, Schwartz would not have had the same preparation for a fast-paced life on Wall Street.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Picture a budding Indiana Jones delicately dusting off an artifact dug up in Harvard Yard. Now picture the same person tearing it up on the erg at crew practice. Though not the most common pairing of work and play, these are the versatile talents of senior first varsity heavyweight David Wakulich—rowing and archaeology. And he’ll be the first to admit their seeming mismatch.
“They’re both outdoors?” Wakulich jokes, when asked how the two activities are related.
But behind his humor rests a sincere willingness to trade in practicality for passion.
“When it came down to choosing a concentration, some [options] may have made more sense career-wise, but I ultimately needed something that was enjoyable and interesting to me,” the senior explains. “And you’d be surprised—Harvard has stockpiles of archaeological resources no one knows about.”
Of all the aspects of studying archaeology, Wakulich has most enjoyed, unsurprisingly, field work, where he has learned to work within his unit—archeologist lingo for the other team that invokes Dave’s loyalty.
As Wakulich has developed a respect for the teamwork, patience, and attention to detail involved in his academic studies, he has also cultivated these values rowing for the Crimson. Personal development in these two entirely separate spheres has been highly complementary for the 1V heavyweight and was especially critical in light of what was a rocky start to his collegiate rowing career.
During his first semester at Harvard, Wakulich sustained a serious knee injury that kept him off of the water for much of the spring season, a major mental setback for someone who had already secured individual Under-23 titles at Canadian Nationals back in high school.
“It was just an indecisive situation,” Wakulich recalls. “I couldn’t tolerate the painful physical workouts, and rehab wasn’t working.”
Wakulich’s recognition that he needed to make a resolute choice about rowing, coupled with the coaching staff’s encouragement, eventually sparked his comeback.
“I was confident it wasn’t going to be a career-ending [injury],” he says. “In fact, it was probably a blessing in disguise: I love rowing, and time spent away from it only reaffirmed my love for the sport. When I came back, I had nothing but motivation.”
But the transition back into the water was by no means easy. Missing an entire year of college-level rowing and coming from a predominantly sculling background meant that Wakulich had to revamp his technical skill set. Perhaps more importantly, his return to rowing also demanded a change of mentality.
“[At the time], there were good U.S.-level rowers and senior leaders on the team,” he says. “I didn’t want the other guys to think they were pulling me along. I needed to know that I was mentally pulling my own weight.”
Wakulich not only ended up pulling his own weight but also went on to contribute significantly to the team’s success. Rewarded with a spot on the first varsity eight boat, a position he has held since, the standout helped Harvard to a decorated 2009-10 season.
“I thought it was pretty amazing,” heavyweight captain Ant Locke notes. “Some of us had written him off. To see him jump straight in was really impressive. It’s a testament to his character. I mean, he’s a physiologically very big guy, but he’s also just a great leader on the team.”
Last year, the Crimson posted a 7-1 overall dual mark, captured titles at Eastern Sprints in Worcester, Mass., the annual Harvard-Yale regatta, and won The Ladies’ Challenge Plate at the Henley Royal Regatta in England. Topping the varsity eight’s celebrated season was the heavyweight team’s distinction as 2009-10 Co-Crew of the Year by the EARC.
Despite a series of high school and collegiate accolades, Wakulich’s prowess on the water shows no signs of abating, as he looks to row for Team Canada after graduation.
“Things are obviously subject to change, but that’s what I’m gearing myself towards,” he says. “This upcoming summer, I’ll be trialling for the U23 national team. I’m still going to try my hardest to go to the Olympics one day.”
And for someone who has made his mark as an individual rower, Wakulich has no qualms about making bigger personal and athletic adjustments as a national team player.
“I wouldn’t want to be selfish in those kinds of endeavors,” he points out. “It’s a little more significant when you’re competing for your country. I’d be more than eager to be wherever I’m needed.”
Wakulich’s teammates also show no doubt in his ability to take his rowing to the next level.
“He’s well-equipped to do that kind of thing,” Locke says. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see him on the national scene.”
But for the time being, Wakulich is just your average water-treading archaeologist.
“I play guitar and piano,” Wakulich casually notes, “and I just like crushing the erg.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a school renowned for its diversity, Harvard is home to students from all backgrounds, concentrations, hometowns, nationalities, and talents. Athletic teams are not exempt. In fact, for the seniors of men’s heavyweight crew, diversity is one of the program’s best qualities.
The class, composed of seven rowers, hails from everywhere from England to Oregon to Canada; studies everything from economics to anthropology to government; and has interests ranging from windsurfing to HoCo to hiking. But the important thing is what brings them all together in their final year at Harvard: rowing.
“We all do different things off the water,” senior Ben French says, “but when we get down to the boathouse, we are definitely one team.”
Success came quickly for this class. As a freshman eight, they took first place in the Eastern Sprints Regatta, earning an invitation to compete at the Henley Royal Regatta in England. Since that season, the current seniors have lost rowers and have separated into different boats, but with just a few months between the last Head of the Charles Regatta and graduation, they are coming together again as team leaders and as a class that has seen Harvard rowing through highs and lows in the last three years.
“The group we have left is a great group of guys and all very inspiring in their own way,” captain Ant Locke says. “We’ve learned a tremendous amount about rowing but also about how to rely on one another.  That’s what happens when you row together.”
Any Crimson rower can attest to the grueling practice schedule that crew requires, an everyday commitment that involves early mornings, rows on the water in all weather conditions, stadium runs, and time trials on the erg. But the members of this senior class would also tell you that practice, grueling or not, inevitably brings them together.
“We put the work in together and really trust the training,” Locke says. “In general, the team bonds over getting through practice.”
“We feel very close and united by the fact that we’ve been together for four years and have stuck it out,” French adds.
For the younger members of the program, the senior rowers have not only stuck it out but have become leaders on the team.
“The class definitely brings a lot of energy and enthusiasm,” junior Mike DiSanto says. “They have really stepped up and set an example for us to follow. It’s an impressive thing to see.”
DiSanto was one of two underclassmen to accompany the seniors to the Head of the Oklahoma Regatta two weekends ago. It is tradition for senior rowers to race together in their final fall season at the Head of the Oklahoma. And for the current senior class, the race marked the first time the men had competed together in the same boat since their rookie year.
“It was really special to get back in the boat at the same time…and race with them again,” French says.
But rowing is about more than racing.
Being a part of the rowing program at Harvard has not only brought these seniors together through racing but has opened the door to opportunity and growth.
“Being on the team requires you to be organized enough to balance schoolwork and practice,” Locke says. “You learn a lot about teamwork and a lot of useful stuff for later life, and you make fantastic friends.”
“Rowing has been a staple for me every single day,” French echoes. “I’ve gotten to travel to places I’ve never been, I’ve made some really good friendships, and I’ve become a part of something that has such a long history at Harvard.”
With the race in Oklahoma past and its final Head of the Charles fast approaching, the senior class has the task of defining how it will leave its mark, continuing the program’s more than 150-year-old legacy of a strong work ethic, team spirit, commitment, and fast results.
“We want to set a standard of working hard and keep what’s going, going,” French says, “even if it means going to train with younger guys outside of our own practice time.”
For the underclassmen, the seniors’ efforts have already made a lasting impression.
“They have a very clear goal that they set for us,” DiSanto says. “It’s not just about being good within our team or being good within our league but about being the best we can be and living up to our potential.”
With the different interests and backgrounds that define their class, the seven seniors will likely go in all different directions following graduation, but rowing, the special sport that brought them together during their time at Harvard, will undeniably be the tie that binds beyond college too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s always fun to buck the trend. Just ask Rachel Rauh.
The senior is the first coxswain in over two decades to be named captain of Radcliffe women’s heavyweight crew.
“I was really surprised...and very honored,” Rauh says. “[I was] really excited to be able to lead the charge with the team and take it where I want it.”
But her path to the top has had its fair share of bumps.
Rauh began crew her freshman year of high school at Phillips Academy Andover as a coxswain in one of the lower boats. She wasn’t thrilled by the sport—at least initially.
“I was pretty ambivalent about it,” the Leverett House resident says, “but then I started to fall in love with it.”
From there, Rauh’s stock began to rise as she moved to higher boats, finally reaching the top boat during her senior year at Andover. Her coxing abilities caught the eye of the Radcliffe coaches, who snagged Rauh as a recruit.
But once she got to Cambridge, it was back to the bottom. Her freshman year, Rauh manned the novice eight, the lowest heavyweight crew boat. The following season, she coxed the second varsity eight and the varsity four.
Then everything changed her junior year. Motivated by what she saw as a disappointing sophomore season, Rauh set a lofty goal: cox the first boat at the Head of the Charles Regatta.
“She came up to me in the fall and just said...something along the lines of, ‘I don’t care what I have to do, I’m coxing the first boat for the Head of the Charles,’” senior Olivia Coffey recounts, laughing. “And I was like, ‘All right, let’s see it.’”
That’s when Rauh kicked it into full gear.
“Every practice, when we were on the course, she was always taking the turns as she would in the Head of the Charles,” Coffey adds. “Every day, she was on it, and I knew at that point that she was going to have the first boat for the Head of the Charles. And she did.”
But Rauh’s climb to the pinnacle of Radcliffe crew was not finished. An even bigger surprise came seven months after the Head of the Charles, when the athletes voted Rauh one of two captains for this season. Fittingly, Coffey—Rauh’s teammate at Andover—is the other.
Typically, rowers, and not coxswains, are captains because, as the logic goes, a captain needs to be a leader not only on the water but also in the physically demanding workouts in which coxswains usually do not participate. This explains why the team had not selected a coxswain as captain since 1989.
And this is where Rauh differs.
“Rachel, more than any other coxswain here, does as much as she can—almost like physically as much as she can,” Coffey explains. “She’ll come to our weights practices, and she works out on her own, because she has the mentality of an athlete, and she has this desire to compete.”
Rauh does more for the team than simply attend workouts. She’s a top-notch coxswain, but perhaps more importantly, she is a remarkably effective leader.
“She motivates people to want to pull harder during races,” sophomore Scout Moran says. “She’s just someone you want to impress.”
And as with many great leaders, Rauh’s faith in her team is unflappable.
“In the first day of practice this year,” Moran recalls, “she stood up and she’s like, ‘Hey, look around. This is a really fast team.’ And she kind of [talked] about how we need to get there.”
Rauh’s election as captain came as no surprise to Moran.
“[She] has every quality that you would want your  team captain to have,” Moran notes. “I’m a big fan.”
And though the team’s selection of a coxswain as captain was unusual, Radcliffe coach Liz O’Leary understands the decision.
“They respect Rachel for her...enthusiasm and spirit and loyalty to the team,” O’Leary says. “[She demonstrates] loyalty to her teammates, to her team, [and] to the sort of values and principles and goals that we have.”
The senior will try to put these leadership skills to use in this weekend’s Head of the Charles Regatta, where she will cox the top boat in the fall’s most important event for the second straight year. And in characteristic Rauh style, she is ready for the challenge.
“We’re excited to just kind of go after it, see if we can win it, see how fast we can get boats down the course,” Rauh says. “It’ll be a lot of fun.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some athletes are bred from childhood by parents or coaches to be great and are pushed into the spotlight at an early age. Take Tiger Woods, for example, or the Williams sisters. But other athletes stumble upon greatness, one day making a conscious choice to pursue excellence in a sport they love.
Given his innate athletic ability and the rowing legacy in his family, Will Newell certainly could have been the first of these two types of athletes. Even his surname is synonymous with rowing greatness—the Harvard men’s boathouse is of course Newell Boathouse, although Will notes there’s no relation.
But Newell, now the captain of the Harvard men’s lightweight team, truly belongs in the second category, having made a series of decisions later than most elite athletes do that propelled him onto the Harvard and world rowing scene.
Despite having a mother who rowed for Radcliffe while herself attending Harvard, Newell made it all the way through sophomore year of high school without developing a callous or racing in a shell. Even when his younger brother, Alex, picked up crew as an eighth grader, Newell wasn’t tempted to jump in a boat right away. Instead, the standout athlete was hitting his stride and making a name for himself running cross-country and track.
“I ran three seasons freshman and sophomore year and was doing well, but I didn’t really like outdoor track,” Will says. “So, after that, I ran the fall and winter of junior year but decided I wanted to try something else in the spring.”
At that time, rowing and coaching great Tom Bohrer had recently started coaching Alex at Wayland-Weston Crew. The plan was to put together a lightweight four to race that spring, but the group was short two rowers. The timing and opportunity were perfect for Will to make the jump from track to crew.
“I said to myself, if there’s ever a time to start rowing, it’s now, because there’s a really good coach, and I am running out of time,” Newell recalls.
That spring, the Wayland-Weston youth men’s lightweight four made it all the way to the USRowing Youth National Championships in Cincinnati, Ohio. The crew finished second overall, and after that exposure to high-level racing, Newell had caught the rowing bug.
“Will had been considering running in college and had been contacted by several running coaches,” explaines Will’s mother, Nelia Newell ’79. “But, after that summer experience, he came back and said, ‘I want to row in college.’”
In a single season, Newell transitioned sports and caught up to or surpassed most rowers his age that had been racing for years, enough so to catch the eye of collegiate coaches.
“Yeah, he was mostly a runner,” recalls Harvard lightweight men’s coach Charley Butt. “But he rowed enough for us to know that he had a lot of potential, and a long-time friend and trusted coach said, ‘This guy could do it.’ Will’s enthusiastic about the racing, and he’s not one to back down. I’d say he has a good competitive spirit, just the sort of thing that you look for.”
In the fall of his senior year, Newell started looking at schools. Dartmouth, Princeton, and Harvard all had boathouses within walking distance of the main campus and consequently became his top choices.
“I had a great time on the recruiting trip [to Princeton], was all set to go to there, and then at the last second I came here,” Newell says. “I think what it finally came down to is that they were basically even academically, but that it would be a better experience coming to Harvard.”
Again, Newell made a decision all his own. And looking back on his career at Harvard, the results have been unprecedented.
After excelling as a freshman, stroking the first freshman eight, Newell advanced to six-seat of the first varsity boat as a sophomore. In the 2008-09 season, he helped the first eight to an 8-1 finish in the regular season, a silver medal at EARC Sprints, and a bronze medal at the IRA National Championships.
Last year, Newell was in the first varsity boat again. This time the eight went 10-0 in dual racing action but again came up short of its goal, finishing second at Sprints and third at IRAs.
“Well, it’s tricky, because you can’t medal four times out of four races in three years and say you’re disappointed,” Newell explains. “That’s not fair to everyone else out there who didn’t medal. But at the same time, everyone was disappointed.”
Now the captain of the lightweight squad, Newell is drawing on his summer experience stroking the U.S. Under-23 lightweight men’s four. The senior’s boat, which included junior teammate Austin Meyer, took bronze at the 2010 World Rowing Under-23 Championships, further fueling the Crimson’s desire for gold this year.
“Racing over the summer, the difference was just that you take the dedication you put into it day to day up to a different level,” Newell says. “You learn how to increase your focus level, increase your game, increase your capacity for training. Those are all sorts of things that I’ve gotten better at over the past summer and that I want to bring to the team so that when we’re on the water, we’re capable of working harder and working smarter. And hopefully that will give us the edge we need.”
Newell is in the stroke seat again this weekend for the Head of the Charles as a member of the varsity eight for the third consecutive season. The team and Newell have high hopes for what they can achieve this weekend and this year. Before Newell graduates and potentially makes his next move onto the senior national team, he has a few goals yet to achieve—starting with a win this weekend.
“Will has always had a knack for rowing, and he’s built his mileage up considerably rowing in eights and small boats at Harvard,” Butt says. “I like to see the guys pursue the opportunities and just see how far they can go. And he’s done that, so I’m very happy with the way he’s made the best use of his opportunities here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Mary Maginnis and Shelley Pearson first met as members of the 2008 U.S. Junior National Rowing Team, the two rowers instantly hit it off, establishing a friendship that would last well over the summer. As highly-recruited athletes, the pair decided to reunite once again—this time, as collegiate teammates on the Radcliffe heavyweight rowing team.
“When we met at junior nationals, Mary and I became best friends,” Pearson says.
“To enter the school year with a sense of trust already established was pretty awesome,” Maginnis adds.
Now both sophomores, Maginnis and Pearson are part of a class expected to contribute much to the Black and White this season. Together with fellow classmates Scout Moran, Celia Kohl, Jess Mealia, Marisa D’Orsogna, Andrea Rickey, Charlotte Lane, Laura Savarese, and Shauna Stewart, they will strive to return the Radcliffe heavyweight program back to prominence after the squad failed to qualify for NCAAs last season.
And while members of the highly-recruited class gained valuable experience competing on the varsity eight and second varsity boats last season, their youth and adjustment to collegiate rowing often contributed to the growing pains.
“It was a big rebuilding year,” Maginnis says. “We lost a lot of great rowers. As tough as our season was, though, it was necessary, because it really changed our mentality and attitudes.”
“We definitely tried to live up to Radcliffe standards,” Pearson says. “Our class showed what we had to offer. As the years come along, we’ll definitely get better.”
One year later, it appears that time is now.
With Pearson and Kohl finishing first in the women’s open pair event at the Head of the Housatonic regatta two weeks ago, the sophomore class has turned talent and potential into results.
This weekend, at the Head of the Charles Regatta, Pearson and Kohl will compete in Radcliffe’s priority boat—the four—while other members of the sophomore class will contribute in the three varsity eight boats.
“Sometimes, not having a season the way you want it to go adds a lot of motivation to go out and really be on top of your game every day,” Rickey says. “We’re supportive of each other, and we’re committed to the workout and the team.”
In addition to working on improving technique and getting faster, members of the sophomore class realize that intangibles like team chemistry are crucial to a team’s success. Though many of the rowers developed friendships at developmental camps and junior nationals, the class has continued to be proactive in bonding with each other.
“These are the girls I’m going to be spending four years with, so I want to get to know them really well,” Maginnis says. “It’s important to spend time together outside the boathouse.”
“You’re spending three hours a day, six days a week in this little 60-foot by 3-foot boat on the water, so you have to be together,” Rickey adds. “You have to know each and every person on a personal, intimate level. You have to know what motivates them to make this boat move.”
And through the common bond of rowing, this diverse group of girls has come together not only as teammates, but also as best friends.
“Shelley and I are rooming together, Jess and Scout room together, and Andrea basically lives in our room,” Maginnis says with a laugh. “We’ll get together for breakfast and dinner, and we’ll celebrate a girl’s birthday together. We have a lot of fun with each other.”
But that doesn’t mean the group avoids competition. With only a limited number of seats in the top boats and plenty of talented rowers, the sophomores understand they must battle each other for the chance to row.
“When we’re on the water, everyone is competitive against each other, but it’s because we all want the team to go faster,” Pearson says. “We don’t let that affect us when we’re off the water. You just have to separate the two.”
“We practice the way we want to race,” Rickey says. “When we’re on the water, we have to be competitors, and we have to take it seriously, as if the boat next to us is Princeton or Stanford.”
With such strong camaraderie, a competitive edge, and a desire to win, the sophomore rowers of the Radcliffe heavyweights are undoubtedly ready to make a collective impact on the team.
“As the coxswain, I get to sit back and see on the water what everyone brings to the table,” Rickey says. “Each individual of our class has something incredible to offer. We’re definitely a well-rounded class that really embodies what Radcliffe crew is known for and aspires to be. Our class will work hard to make a great contribution to the team, but we’ll also have fun and enjoy each other’s company.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Depth. Experience. Hunger. Talent. Success. Potential. The Lucky ’13s seem to have everything—except Eastern Sprints gold. After checking off everything on its to-do list except that final accomplishment, all nine members of last year’s first lightweight freshman eight have returned to Newell Boathouse emboldened by their success and fueled by the one blemish on an otherwise stainless season.
Joining them on their quest is a group of walk-ons who’d never handled an oar before arriving in Cambridge and taking a seat on last year’s 2F boat.
The sophomore class, nicknamed the “Lucky ’13s” by Harvard lightweight freshman coach Linda Muri, is the first in her nine-year tenure to return its entire 1F and 2F lineups from the year before. Both boats took silver at EARC Sprints in May.
“That has to be the best combined record in my time here,” Muri says.
The success started last fall when the Harvard 1F won the Princeton Chase, took fourth in the Club Eight—a heavyweight event—at the Head of the Charles, and then won the Tail of the Charles.
“They seemed to really get along very well from the first day on move-in,” Muri says. “They stood on the dock in a huge circle and talked for a while.”
That closeness continued to translate into on-the-water success in the spring, when, according to Muri,  the 1F went undefeated in the dual season for the first time since 1979 before finally falling to Princeton in the finals of Eastern Sprints.
Now on the varsity team, the nine from that first freshman boat have wasted little time making an impact—no small accomplishment given that the lightweight varsity eight also finished its dual season unbeaten.
“It’s been really competitive,” sophomore Erich Schultze says. “It’s really exciting to be able to push the juniors and seniors. I think because of the depth we have...it can make all the boats in the program better.”
“They will definitely impact the team for the next three years,” Muri concurs. “We’ll see a lot [of them] in the 1V and 2V.”
With all nine of the 2F returning, the sophomore impact won’t be limited to the 1F alums alone.
“The 2F definitely got some good results,” Schultze says. “More than the results, we really got close with them. They bought into what it was to be part of the team. They really enjoyed it, saw a lot of value in it.”
Hoping to bring the walk-ons closer with the recruits last year, Muri paired each recruit with a novice rower and found the effort to be quite successful.
“That core group was very welcoming of the novice guys,” Muri recalls. “I think the [pair] that was the most surprising was Arturo Villanueva and James Groeneveld. Somehow they really hit it off in a way that was entertaining and just eye-opening.”
The bond between the Texan walk-on and the Australian recruit was just one example of the cohesiveness of last year’s freshman class. That kind of closeness translated into competitiveness on the water.
“We took a lot of inspiration from the recruits,” says Simon Maas, a walk-on who rowed in the bow seat of the 2F. “[There was] a strong team atmosphere, a sense of inter-competition, but we always knew we were competing with each other, not against each other.”
The 2F thrived in the competition, falling only to Yale and Navy in the dual season. In its biggest race of the year, the boat bit the Bulldogs back, taking second to Navy at Eastern Sprints.
“It showed that we had improved and had desire for a little bit more,” Maas says. “We were fueled [by the loss to Yale]. It was really nice to come back from that and get the silver medal at Sprints.”
And according to Muri, the 2F’s impact cannot be measured by its record alone.
“[The success of the team] had to do with having that strong group of guys in the 2F pushing that strong group of guys in the 1F,” Muri says.
Now in their second year rowing on the Charles, the walk-ons are facing their next big challenge: competing for seats in one of the top lightweight programs in the country.
“It’s an entirely different pool,” Maas says. “It’s a lot more inspirational being amongst [the varsity] guys. It says a lot about the program that you can pick up a sport and then next year be competing against guys who row for their respective national teams and are some of the best rowers in the country, at least at the collegiate level.”
While Maas and his fellow walk-ons may not have matched the level of the national team rowers quite yet, their talent and motivation have their coaches optimistic about their futures on the squad.
“I think they’re just going to be coming into their own,” Muri says. “They’re going to continue to surprise themselves. They need some more time, some more miles. This is going to be the start of what they can do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All right, Ivy League football fans—it’s time to get serious. At this point, I know everyone is sick and tired of non-conference play.
After all, what do we have to show from the past five weeks besides a handful of wins against Patriot League foes, some devastating injuries, and a couple embarrassing losses (cough, Cornell, cough)?
Anyways, it’s time for the Ancient Eight to do what it does best: be exclusive.
From here on in, no outsiders are welcome. Matchups within the Ivy League are all that are left on the docket for the 2010 season.
Besides the fact that this means I only have to make four predictions this week—and hence can return to playing NBA 2K11 sooner—the end of nonconference play has other important implications.
After this week, we should have an even better sense of which team is the clear frontrunner for the league championship.
Two opponents with undefeated conference records—Penn and Yale—square off against each other, while other contenders—Harvard and Columbia—hope to avoid picking up their second losses and falling out of the race.
No. 23 PENN (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) at YALE (4-1, 2-0 Ivy)
When the Ivy League’s top offense is pitted against the league’s top defense, something’s gotta give. While Yale’s high-powered attack has been on a tear this season—averaging 410 yards of offense per game—it will be put to the test against the Quakers, which are surrendering just 69.2 rushing yards per game.
The Penn defense also has history on its side, having not surrendered a point to the Bulldogs since 2008. If the Quakers hope to keep that streak alive, they will have to slow Yale quarterback Patrick Witt, who returns to the field this week after missing his team’s matchup with Fordham last weekend while serving a one-week suspension.
In four games of action Witt has averaged 277 yards per contest and tossed six touchdown passes. Penn will also have its hands full dealing with running back Alex Thomas, who has found the end zone four times this season. Luckily for the Quakers, half of Yale’s dynamic rushing duo will be missing this Saturday, as sophomore runner Mordecai Cargill underwent surgery Wednesday morning. With Cargill’s absence in mind, expect good defense to prevail over good offense.
Prediction: Penn 21, Yale 10.
CORNELL (1-4, 0-2 Ivy) at BROWN (3-2, 2-0 Ivy)
Last weekend wasn’t very pretty for fans of Cornell football. Hosting Colgate, the Big Red suffered the most lopsided loss of any Ivy League team this season, falling 44-3. Cornell hopes it can turn things around this weekend by snapping its eight-game Ivy losing streak against Brown. But that seems unlikely.
Even without first team All-Ivy quarterback Kyle Newhall-Caballero—who suffered a season-ending injury in the Bears’ third contest against Rhode Island—Brown should be able to get past Cornell fairly easily behind its above-average defense and strong air attack.
Prediction: Brown 24, Cornell 7.
HARVARD (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) at PRINCETON (1-4, 0-2 Ivy)
I know the Harvard-Princeton matchup that everyone is really looking forward to won’t take place until Feb. 4 when the schools’ hoopsters meet on the hardwood, but in the meantime we will have to make due with football.
While the Crimson and the Tigers possess basketball teams that are more or less evenly matched, the same cannot be said about the two schools’ football programs.
Harvard has taken 12 of its last 14 matchups against Princeton on the gridiron and has outscored the Tigers 88-33 over the past three seasons.
It doesn’t seem like much will change this year. Through five games, Princeton possesses the league’s second lowest scoring offense and also the worst scoring defense—generally not a recipe for success.
Prediction: Harvard 28, Princeton 6.
DARTMOUTH (3-2, 0-2 Ivy) at COLUMBIA (3-2, 1-1 Ivy)
If there’s one team that’s going to mourn the end of nonconference play, it’s Dartmouth. The Big Green finished up its non-conference slate last weekend with a 27-19 win over Holy Cross, making Dartmouth 3-0 against foes from outside the Ancient Eight.
But the Ivy League has been a different story for the Big Green, as the squad has dropped its first two league contests to Penn and Yale. That being said, this squad is a stronger Ivy opponent than its 0-2 conference record suggests. Led by running back Nick Schwieger’s 146 rushing yards per game, Dartmouth has nearly come out on top in both its matchups with two of the Ivy League’s top teams, losing each contest by seven points or less.
If Columbia hopes to keep the Big Green’s conference losing streak alive, it will have to get another big game from quarterback Sean Brackett. Brackett, who has thrown for 11 touchdowns and averages 203 passing yards per game, also leads the Lions in rushing yards, averaging 56.2 per game. While this should be a close contest, the Big Green’s days without a conference victory seem numbered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

With its season already halfway over, the Harvard football team will look to kick things into high gear when it delves into the meat of its conference season beginning this weekend.
Having wrapped up its final non-conference game last weekend against Lehigh, the Crimson (3-2, 1-1 Ivy) will head down to Powers Field on Saturday at 1 p.m. to take on Princeton (1-4, 0-2), as the race for the Ivy League crown begins to pick up in intensity.
When league-only play starts this weekend, every Ancient Eight squad, including the two aforementioned teams, has the opportunity to gain some ground in the conference standings and make a run for this year’s Ivy League title.
“Our kids are excited, always excited to play Princeton,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Every game when you only have 10 is a big game on your schedule…but the Princeton game is one of the big ones marked on the schedule. Everybody wants to be Harvard’s rival. Princeton is our rival.”
The Crimson hopes that the outcome of this game remains true to recent history. Harvard has taken 11 of the last 13 meetings between these two teams, including the last three.
Meanwhile, the Tigers are looking to end their three-game losing streak with their first Ivy League win of the season.
After coming off of disappointing Week-5 losses, both teams are looking for a momentum swing going into the rest of the conference schedule with a victory this weekend. Each team saw substantial halftime leads disappear due to lack of offensive production in the second halves of their respective games.
Going into halftime last weekend, Princeton led Brown by 13 points but fell to the Bears in the end by a score of 17-13.
Similarly, the Crimson held a 17-0 halftime lead over visiting Lehigh but was unable to produce on offense or hold back the Mountain Hawks on defense, resulting in a 21-19 loss for Harvard.
The Tigers surrendered 338 yards of total offense to Brown last weekend, including 153 yards on the ground.
This matchup could prove to be a big opportunity for the Crimson running back trio of senior Gino Gordon and sophomores Treavor Scales and Rich Zajeski. The three head the Ivy League’s second-leading rushing offense.
In the past three games, Harvard has rushed for an average of 280 yards, gaining an average of over six yards per carry.
The three tailbacks are looking forward to taking advantage of Princeton’s rushing defense, which has given up an average of 207 yards on the ground per game this season and is ranked second-to-last in the Ivy League.
“We didn’t make enough plays in the second half last week,” Scales said. “We ran pretty well in the first half, but we didn’t come out to compete after halftime. We’re going to play for the entire game this week and not stop until the clock runs out.”
An intriguing matchup to look out for in this contest is between the offense for the Tigers and the Crimson defense. Both units have suffered a multitude of injuries in the past several weeks.
Most recently, Princeton starting quarterback Tommy Wornham injured his shoulder last week against the Bears last week.
The Harvard defensive line will look to take advantage of the oppositon’s signal-caller situation and inexperienced offensive line, which returns only two starters from last year.
“We really think that it’s going to be critical for our front four to get pressure on their quarterback, something we didn’t do a week ago,” Murphy said, “and I think those guys are very motivated to get that done.”
On the flip side, the Crimson will have to contend with the Tigers’ receiving corps, led by seniors Andrew Kerr and Trey Peacock, the Ivy League’s leader in receptions and receiving yards per game.
“They’ve got…arguably the best group of wide receivers in the league right now, starting with Trey Peacock,” Murphy said. “[But] I think we’re going to match up fine. We were really encouraged last week at times, especially with how [senior defensive back] Nico Amaro stepped up.”
With virtually every team in the Ancient Eight sustaining significant injuries, a win this weekend could propel almost any team in the conference to the top of the pack.
But Harvard is only concerning itself with its next opponent.
“There is no position other than beat Princeton,” Murphy said. “That’s all there is. It’s just one game at a time, one play at a time, because the only destiny that we control is finding a way to beat Princeton. Nothing else exists for us in our world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The halfway point in the Ivy League season presents an opportunity for teams to take a moment to assess their season so far.
With three out of seven Ivy League matchups completed, Harvard has played itself into a position where there will be little margin for error here on out.
After racking up a win over Yale and a pair of draws against Brown and Cornell, the Crimson (4-4-5, 1-0-2 Ivy) looks to remain in the hunt for the league crown this Sunday when it visits No. 23 Princeton (10-2-0, 3-0-0 Ivy) at Roberts Stadium in an Ancient Eight showdown that will be broadcasted nationally on ESPNU.
One more conference loss or draw could seriously cripple Harvard’s hopes for the Ivy League title.
Last season, the Tigers knocked off the heavily-favored Harvard, ranked ninth at the time, in double overtime with a 102nd minute goal to win, 2-1.
Though the Crimson eventually went on to capture the Ancient Eight title, while Princeton finished third, last year’s match nonetheless left a bitter taste in the mouths of many players on the Harvard sideline.
“We felt that we gave one of our best performances of the year during that game,” co-captain Robert Millock said. “But unfortunately we also had a lot of guys that just had bad games. So even though we were solid defensively throughout the game, but we just didn’t execute, we didn’t play well offensively.”
This year’s Tigers—unlike the underdog Princeton teams of past seasons—have shown themselves to be of a radically different character than squads Harvard has faced in recent years.
The Tigers are currently riding a seven-game winning streak—with three of the victories coming against Ivy League competitors—to put themselves tied with Penn for first place in the conference standings with nine points.
In that same span, Princeton outscored its opponents, 21-5, netting an average of three goals per contest.
As a result, Sunday’s matchup against the red-hot Tigers likely presents the Crimson’s toughest competition so far in the Ivy League season.
“Right now we are in third place in the Ivy League with five points, within striking distance of both of the first-place teams, and we still have both those teams on our schedule,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said.  “So we feel that we have control over our Ivy League season…but another tie would only keep us below Princeton and Penn in terms of the points race.”
In its last outing, the Crimson held a 1-0 lead over No. 20 Boston College in the second half, but could not hold on in the end, as the Eagles came back with two late goals to earn a 2-1 victory.
“I think we learned a lot about ourselves going forward, which was important because our goal is the Ivy League,” Millock said. “We used the game against BC to try out our new formation and see if we could be more dangerous. Everyone was pretty happy with the chances that we created, so overall we were pretty disappointed with the outcome of the BC game.”
By contrast, in the Tigers’ last match, late game action served them well. In the 82nd minute of play, senior Josh Walburn scored the game-winning goal to lead the squad to a win over Columbia, 3-2.
It is clear that Harvard must play to its highest potential for a whole 90 minutes in order to beat the Tigers.
“As a team coming off a really hot streak, Princeton is playing with a lot of confidence, and I have a lot of respect for their individual players,” Junot said. “I’ve gotten to know some of the players through recruiting. I have a lot of respect for their coaches so we certainly have a lot of respect for Princeton as an opponent but if we play to the top of our ability, I feel that we are by far the stronger side.”
Much like Junot, Millock also remains hopeful about the team’s prospects against Princeton.
“We feel confident,” Millock said. “We still feel that we are the team to beat in the Ivy League. If we play well and execute out game plan, we believe that we will have success against anyone that we play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Women’s crew is not the only Radcliffe team with an important weekend coming up. The Radcliffe rugby club enters the first round of the playoffs tomorrow, taking on the University of Vermont. A win in Vermont will assure the team a spot at the New England Rugby Football Union (NERFU) Championships next weekend at the University of New Hampshire.
The Black and White is coming off of an exciting win over Bowdoin last weekend, a close victory that played an important role in seeding for the playoffs. Radcliffe (4-1) has had a successful season thus far, notching wins against the University of Maine, the University of New Hampshire, Northeastern, and Bowdoin, and recording only one loss against Boston University at the beginning of October. Since its beginnings in 1982, the Black and White has reached nationals twice, in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Beginning this weekend, Radcliffe looks to continue the winning tradition.

Harvard hosts the 46th annual Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend. It’s one of the biggest Harvard athletic events of the year and something you definitely don’t want to miss…no matter how early in the morning it starts.
Over 9,000 athletes from around the globe come to Cambridge to compete in 60 rowing events, and all four Harvard crew teams will be competing: men’s heavyweight and lightweight and women’s heavyweight and lightweight. Events start around 9 a.m. tomorrow, but the men’s and the women’s heavyweight squads will compete tomorrow afternoon—with the championship fours and eights on Sunday afternoon—and the lightweight teams will compete later that day.
The Harvard football team travels to Princeton this weekend to take on the Tigers tomorrow at 1 p.m. in the Crimson’s third conference game of the season. Last weekend, Harvard lost a nail-biter to Lehigh, 21-19, bringing its overall season record to 3-2. Last season, The Crimson dominated Princeton with its impressive offensive and defense, taming the Tigers, 37-3. If Harvard can maintain that form, we should see another win added to the Crimson’s tally.
The women’s soccer team is also traveling to Princeton for a conference match tomorrow afternoon. Currently, the women stand at 5-6-1 and have a two-game losing streak, including a 2-1 overtime loss to Siena on Tuesday. Harvard is fourth in the Ivy League, while Princeton stands at second. Last season, the Crimson lost to the Tigers, 1-0.
The men’s soccer squad travels with the women’s team to go up against the Tigers as well Sunday afternoon. The men have a 4-4-5 record, including a 2-1 loss to Boston College on Tuesday and two double-overtime ties with Cornell and Brown. The Crimson holds a 1-0-2 Ivy record, which puts the team in third place in the conference. Even though the squad is winless in three matches, history bodes well for Harvard. In the last seven meetings, the men have a 5-1-1 record against Princeton.
The final team going to Princeton this weekend is the field hockey team, which will compete against the Tigers tomorrow at noon. Things looked slightly promising when the women snapped a five-game losing streak earlier in the season, but the squad has fallen into another five-game losing rut. The Harvard squad will have to step up its game to rival Princeton: Princeton is 10-3 for the season and 4-0 in the Ivy League.
For the third time this season, the men’s water polo team battles against MIT. The men will travel to MIT tonight for the tiebreaker game in the series. The Engineers won the first battle barely, 7-6, but the Crimson struck back with a 10-8 victory. Harvard holds a two-game winning steak, which bodes well for its momentum going into the match tonight.
In other Harvard sports happenings this weekend, the women’s volleyball team takes on Yale at home tonight and then Brown tomorrow evening. The women’s ice hockey team also kicks off its season in its first exhibition match against McGill. The women’s tennis squad travels to Hanover, N.H. for the ITA Northeast Regional Championships, nearing the end of its individual season. Finally, the cross-country team competes in the Mayor’s Cup at Franklin Park in Boston.

Several Leverett  residents chanced upon an exciting spotting last Sunday afternoon (no, not  Shaq)  when they encountered a praying mantis in their house courtyard. Though praying mantises are often released into  gardens to devour pests, their natural habitat doesn’t stretch this far  north, making this quite the unusual find.

 
Lisa M. Ackerman '11  and Elizabeth C. Spira '11 first encountered the praying mantis on a  bench in the Leverett House courtyard and were quickly joined by  Leverett House tutor Jeffrey B. Miller. Miller helped move the mantis to a  hedge where, according to Miller, “he was basically invisible unless you  knew what to look for.” Miller and Spira later photographed their  encounters with the insect.

Ben Stiller wasn’t on campus, but that didn’t stop the Harvard Art Museum Undergraduate Connection from hosting “Night at the Sackler Museum,” an event intended to bring students behind the scenes of the museum from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. Thursday night. Flyby sent a correspondent who had never been to the Sackler to check the event out.
The night included tours of the museum’s exhibits, a performance by the (Harvard-Radcliffe Veritones, one of the College’s co-ed a capella groups, and cake served by Thomas Lentz, the Cabot Director of the Harvard Art Museums. The cake was accompanied by fortune cookies.
On the “Deciphering Symbols and Creating Meaning from Art” tour, a group of visitors trekked to the fourth floor of the museum and saw artist Gustave Moreau’s “Young Man and Death” and the modern art section, which included “I’m with Stupid” by Rachel Harrison. Harrison’s piece poses the meta-question, “Who gets to decide what belongs in a museum?” according to Yvette Ramirez ’12, who led the tour.
One of the students who attended the event said she saw a link between the museum and her coursework. Kristina F. Latino ’13, a prospective HAA concentrator, said, “I came to see a lot of the works that I am reading about in class.”
Kristen J. DePre ’13, who is also considering concentrating in History of Art and Architecture, said, “It’s nice to see lots of people from the outside coming into the museum. Even with the construction [at the Fogg Museum] there is still a collection here and students are more than welcome.”

Currier House Masters Elizabeth A. Ross and Richard W. Wrangham, who are on sabbatical, have been very busy in their months away from Harvard, and in their time away, they’ve put together a blog that chronicles their voyages across three continents.
In Tanzania, Wrangham, a professor of biological anthropology, and Ross visited the chimpanzee research site used by Jane Goodall, Ross wrote on the blog. Wrangham also attended a weeklong conference in Japan for the International Primate Society. Ross, meanwhile, has been continuing her work as executive director of the non-profit Kaiisi Project.
And what about the students back home in Currier? They’re delighted to hear from their House Masters.
“All of us in Currier love Richard and Elizabeth,” said Kevin T. Chen ’13, “So the blog really gives us a chance to keep in touch with them and get a glimpse of what fascinating things they’re doing.”
