After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hollywood was just starting to learn its lesson in time for the landmark 90th Academy Awards. However, two years after #OscarsSoWhite, it’s clear that they’re not done contending with biases in the entertainment industry just yet. With a flood of sexual harassment allegations, the #MeToo movement gave voices to women not only across the field, but across the country. This movement is another seismic shift in an industry that has been controlled by powerful, white men for far too long.
The Oscars provided a glimpse of the beautiful future the film industry will hopefully one day enjoy, featuring many historic firsts and landmarks for underrepresented groups. Greta Gerwig, writer and director of “Lady Bird,” became the fifth woman to be nominated for Best Director while Rachel Morrison, director of photography for “Mudbound,” became the first woman to be nominated for Best Cinematography in the history of the Academy. The writer and director of “Mudbound,” Dee Rees, became the first black woman to be nominated for best adapted screenplay and Jordan Peele was the first black filmmaker to be nominated for writing, directing, and producing in the same year for “Get Out.” Peele also took home the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Finally, Yance Ford, director of “Strong Island,” became the first openly transgender director nominated as well as the first transgender man to be nominated for any Oscar. That being said, the failure of most of these nominees to win in their categories, with the exception of Jordan Peele’s win for Original Screenplay, demonstrates that the Academy still has a long road ahead in terms of honoring diversity in the film industry.
The 90th Academy Awards also continued last year’s trend of recognizing films that in previous years would likely have not been nominated (“Moonlight,” Barry Jenkins’ monumental and complex story of black gay male identity). With a younger and more diverse Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, untraditional films like “The Shape of Water,” “Lady Bird,” “Get Out,” and “Call Me By Your Name” were nominated over traditional Oscar-bait blockbusters as in years past, like last year’s  last year’s “Lion” or Leonardo DiCaprio’s “The Revenant.” “Get Out” and “Call Me By Your Name” took the Screenplay awards, Original and Adapted respectively.
“The Shape of Water” led the pack with 13 nominations, taking home four Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director for Guillermo del Toro, Best Original Score for Alexandre Desplat, and Best Production Design. Quite honestly, “The Shape of Water” never should have won Best Picture, let alone received a nomination for the top prize. The problem with the film isn’t the fantasy elements involved or even the fish sex—it’s del Toro’s failure to create an original, compelling script with scene-stealing characters who the audience can fall in love with. The problem lies in del Toro’s over-ambition in his attempt to combine a compelling script (which isn’t compelling at all) with a cast of two-dimensional characters. While I praise del Toro for including a diverse array of characters, he doesn’t spend enough time fleshing out their personalities, leaving characters that are defined by what makes them different rather than their actions and true selves. It just didn’t work. The only Oscar that “The Shape of Water” should have walked away with is Best Production Design. Christopher Nolan should have won Best Director, Jonny Greenwood was robbed of Best Original Score for the beautiful strings in “Phantom Thread,” and any other movie would have been a better choice for Best Picture. In fact, “The Florida Project” should have taken the place of “The Shape of Water” as a nominee—director Sean Baker outdid himself with his unflinching look at modern poverty at a hotel outside the fringes of Disney World. Compassionate and heartbreaking all at once, “The Florida Project” was one of the best films of the year.
However, we must acknowledge that, while Hollywood still has a long way to go, it has started to change. A fantasy film that centers around the relationship between a mute female janitor and a fish monster, “The Shape of Water” is the type of movie that rarely gets recognition from the Academy. Fantasy films are often considered too niche or too obscure for Oscars recognition, but “The Shape of Water” demonstrates a possible shift in the Academy’s beliefs.
The Academy’s attempt to reward representation seemed at odds with a stunt that host Jimmy Kimmel staged halfway through the show. Like last year, when Kimmel brought a Hollywood tour group inside the Dolby Theatre, he attempted again to include the everyday citizen. This time, Kimmel and a slew of actors and filmmakers including Armie Hammer, Guillermo del Toro, Margot Robbie, Ansel Elgort, and Emily Blunt crashed an early screening of “A Wrinkle in Time” at the TCL Chinese Theater next door. While the audience may have been ecstatic to meet some of Hollywood’s stars, some may have been upset to have their early screening cut into. Though it may have been an attempt to bridge the gap between audiences and celebrities, the whole ordeal played off as a patronizing stunt, parading the Hollywood celebrities in front of an audience with the assumption that the latter would relish the opportunity to be in the presence of elite. At a time of growing disparity between Oscar nominated films and the highest grossing movies of each year, Kimmel’s stunt was a cheap attempt to connect audiences to the Oscars.

Tanaz Bhathena’s debut novel “A Girl Like That”—which she describes as a “love letter” to girls everywhere in the afterword—follows Zarin and Porus, two teenagers living in Saudi Arabia, to their untimely deaths. Using the perspectives of the various spectators of Zarin’s life, Bhathena brilliantly redefines what it means to be in love and shows how oppression truly plays a part in how women define themselves. While the trope of a not-so-average girl as the envy of her school is nothing new, the subtle shift in perspective has readers rooting for characters they know will die. As this novel also explores the seemingly thin line between love and abuse, it handles issues we all face with complexity and graceful understanding.
There is nothing wrong with being a girl “like other girls,” but Bhathena nevertheless portrays the difficulty of being different through Zarin’s dating life. Because Zarin is viewed as a girl like no other, she is constantly pursued and other girls either want to be her or for her to disappear. Bhathena implies through this narrative, that the underlying issue is when girls turn on one another under the strain of the male gaze. In contrast is Mishal, an average girl who starts an online gossip blog to report on Zarin and her scandalous behavior. Through Mishal’s plotline, Bhathena shows the pernicious way women treat each other: The story reveals how girls can resort to hatred or a certain ignorance for one another instead of communicating with each other due to pressures placed by the male gaze. When Zarin and Porus die, Mishal tries her best to remember a girl she could not understand and a boy she barely knew.
The characterization of Zarin appears cliché at first, but the layers of her personality prove that she is more than one-dimensional. Bhathena, by masterfully weaving multiple perspectives, forces readers to delve into a gray sea of uncertainty in order to grasp the brutality of parental authority and toxic masculinity that is both encouraged within groups of men and by women themselves. Zarin—like many—grapples with these difficulties and is socially and physically punished for not wanting to have sex with the men she dates. However, sex is expected of her and can thus be nonconsensual at times. Here, Bhathena’s ability to twist dialogue comes brilliantly into play. Bhathena writes, “‘It’s okay, Zarin,’ [Porus] whispered. ‘Relax.’” Without context, this seems to be a soothing and gentle gesture. However, he is actually assaulting Zarin. The novel challenges the complexities in relationships and the trust people put in one another.
This novel lives up to its promise to deliver a “high-stakes romance,” and it does in the most unconventional and unexpected way. The love in this book is, at times, platonic. However, Bhathena has written such deep and insightful character progression that adorable friendships and “high-stakes romances” seem to fold into one. She boldly merges Zarin and Porus’ storylines and readers wish desperately for a happy ending that will never be. Porus is the epitome of lovestruck when it comes to Zarin, but this initial infatuation shifts to become softer and more wholesome. Though Porus loves her unconditionally, Zarin does not completely reciprocate his feelings. When she implies that she may never love him the way he loves her, one of the most beautiful and relatable lines emerge: “The sun dipped into the ocean, staining the sky red. It would be time to take her home soon. Inside my throat was something that felt like a giant ball. I wondered if it was my heart.” In return, Zarin feels the freedom to love him the way she wants to, rather than the way that is expected of her, which is what makes this romance unlike any other.
This novel starts off with the ending, so readers are fully aware of the plot’s trajectory. However, the plot is so wonderfully written that it is easy to get lost in the complexities of these teenage characters and what it means to be “a girl like that.” Although the book initially feels like a cliché, the premise of Bhathena’s first novel proves that people have a long way to go to truly understand one another.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Heterosexual romance has been represented as the great female adventure,” Adrienne Rich writes in “Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence.” There’s always been a dearth of female characters whose narrative revolves around something other than romance, and in the wake of the #MeToo era, that type of story carries more value than ever. Unfortunately, “Indecent,” Corinne Sullivan’s debut novel, is not that story. When Imogene Abney secures a teaching position at the Vandenberg School for Boys, an elite boarding school, she thinks her lifelong obsession with boarding school culture has finally been gratified. But when she starts an affair with a student, Adam “Kip” Kipling, she puts her entire career in jeopardy, in a world that “shatters her sense of victimhood and blame,” according to the back cover blurb.
“Indecent” falsely advertises itself as a book that examines the sexual politics of teacher-student relationships in a critical and innovative way. What Sullivan delivers instead is a variation of a clichéd theme, narrated by an obsessed 22-year-old woman with the sexual experience and emotional complexity of an immature teenager. What’s being “shattered” is less a stereotype about female victimhood, and more Imogene’s own sense of autonomy. In a literary landscape that demands multifaceted and self-determined female characters more than ever, “Indecent” does not undermine the patriarchal hegemony—rather, it does everything in its power to uphold it.
“Indecent” hinges on many of the same impulses as another debut novel, Emma Cline’s stunning 2016 book, “The Girls,” which is about a teenage girl who joins a Manson-like cult. But while Cline’s sharply lyrical prose delves into the nuances of female adolescence, Sullivan’s borrows the voice of a young adult novel, and then proceeds to sap the voice of its vivacity. Like in “The Girls,” Sullivan’s plot presents the opportunity to draw out the systemic factors at work to hold accountable the society that socializes women to scrutinize their flaws, undermine their own ambition, and defer to their male counterparts. Instead, Sullivan provides a character sketch of an infatuated archetype, a woman so caught up nursing her own self-destructive impulses that she becomes uninteresting. “I wanted him to see different sides of me, to wonder what else I could be,” Imogene thinks. Sullivan spends so much of the novel elucidating Imogene’s self-sabotage that the reader begins to wonder whether those other sides exist. Indeed, Imogene spends a great deal of the novel crying: She weeps in the stairwells of Adam’s dorm, and sobs outside until someone finds her, and lies in bed for days at a time, wallowing. “The only way to indulge fully in my misery was to continue to believe Adam Kipling was the best thing that had ever happened to me,” she reflects. “And so I did, and I thought of him and dreamed of him and alternatively rubbed myself between my legs and sobbed until snot dripped down my chin.”
What’s even more tiresome than Imogene’s melodrama is the fictive world that seems inclined to forgive her, even when she shows up to class with a hangover after a wild night in the city, or only realizes that she’s forgotten to write the midterms on the day of the exam. This is a world in which many men—from an oft-referenced college fling to her superior, who is 10 years her elder—desire Imogene. Yet confusingly, she still pines for a barely-legal 17-year-old, whose attention often strays to other girls.
Imogene’s acute unpleasantness would be less obvious if her world wasn’t populated with characters who are infinitely more capable and more interesting than her—but it is. There’s Chapin, the unapologetic cool girl who becomes Imogene’s confidante (“Around Chapin Dunn, I was struck dumb, like a boy with a crush”). There’s Raj, Imogene’s attractive co-apprentice and Kip’s R.A. (“The idea of him having sexual experience made him unexpectedly alluring”). Even Joni, Imogene’s younger sister, contains the multifaceted depth that Imogene lacks (“I wished—as I had many times before—that I could be more like Joni. She never seemed afraid to take risks”). These characters, the objects of Imogene’s reverent fantasies, seem cursorily interesting—yet perhaps because of those fantasies, they quickly fall prey to the same one-dimensionality with which Sullivan treats her protagonist.
It might be possible to set aside these narrative flaws—perhaps chalk them up to an unreliable narrator. After all, there’s space in the world of books for genre novels that compensate for merely passable prose with a buzzy soap opera plot and a cast of attractive characters. But the sex in “Indecent” isn’t remotely alluring. It’s not just bad sex, but bad sex that Imogene imagines to be great sex, which is its own transgression. “Use your magical mouth to make me magically hard,” Kip says in one scene—the same scene in which he flicks his flaccid penis, “a useless pendulum,” and says “Uh-oh, SpaghettiOs.” Imogene finds Kip’s sexual attraction to her armpits endearing: “You know you’re into a girl if you’re into the smell of her pits,” he says. Later: “The way he pretended my nipples were buttons and would poke them with his finger and go, ‘Boop-boop!’” There isn’t enough legitimate literature about female desire, so it’s a shame that Sullivan squanders an opportunity to treat Imogene’s as anything more than a caricature of itself.
By the end of the novel, even Imogene seems exhausted from crying, from complaining, from having to contend with her own self-pitying storyline. “I feel even more pathetic,” she concludes. “I am a problem too unpleasant to contend with.” At least she gets that right.

Joan Tower is a big name in America’s classical music world—a Grammy award-winner and one of the most successful woman composers of all time, she celebrated the end of her residency at New England Conservatory with a concert at Jordan Hall, playing standout works from her prolific career. The Boston Modern Orchestra Project (BMOP), and featuring soloists Carol Wincenc and Adrian Morejon and conducted by Gil Rose, performed Tower’s music stunningly and with an evocative sense of the landscapes the music represented.
The concert opened with the world premiere of “Under the Dome” by Tianyi Wang, a student composer and the winner of the annual BMOP/NEC Composition Competition. The piece was inspired by the environmental hazard of smog in his native country, China. The piece is dark and dissonant, with instruments imitating the heavy breathing of the victims of smog. It was a deeply affecting, though unsettling, start to the concert.
“Rising,” a piece for flute and orchestra and featuring soloist Carol Wincenc, was the first of Joan Tower’s music performed. The aptly named piece began with Wincenc playing long notes rising slowly and steadily in pitch. Wincenc played with a lovely, burnished tone, and the lush sound of the strings, featuring beautiful solos by the principal players who carried the solemn, searching mood of the piece. It was an excellent choice to begin Joan Tower’s works with this piece.
The second piece was “Chamber Dance,” originally commissioned by the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. It had a similar sense of unease, with suppressed, pulsing energy that seemed like the grumblings of the unconscious. The orchestra executed the busy, fluttering notes that seemed to fly by with impressive poise and delicacy. It felt like a companion piece to “Rising” in its similarity.
After a brief intermission, Adrian Morejon, a world-renowned bassoonist, took the stage to perform “Red Maple.” Named for the wood commonly used to make bassoons, the piece highlighted Morejon’s beautiful tone and virtuosic command of complex, swirling passages. Tower’s father was a mineralogist, and his influence on her work is evident in the way her music often draws inspiration from nature. The piece tried to follow a musical pattern but is too convoluted to be fully understood without closer inspection, like the endlessly complex biology of a living organism. Although it was immaculately played, it felt emotionally closed off—colder and more inscrutable than the other pieces.
Wincenc returned to the stage to play Tower’s “Concerto for Flute,” which had the typical Tower mark of restlessness and a natural feel. It conjures up an image of a lonely, wandering journey through hills and woods. Wincenc’s soulful musicality shone through here, perhaps more than in “Rising” because she has had a longer relationship with this piece, as it was originally commissioned for her in 1989.
The concert concluded with a performance of “Made in America,” Tower’s most famous piece, commissioned for 65 orchestras across America by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Ford Motor Company. The recording of the piece, by Leonard Slatkin the conductor of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra, won three Grammy awards. The piece is centered around the theme of “America the Beautiful.” The Boston Modern Orchestra Project played it brilliantly, with a tight rhythm and rich sound. Concertmistress Gabriela Diaz especially played with exceptional lucidity and poise. The piece takes the fearless journey that Tower’s music usually does, beginning optimistically but descending into industrial-sounding, distraught passages, with “America the Beautiful” glowing faintly through every once in a while. This evocative, powerful feeling is exactly why Joan Tower deserves to be honored.

The title sequence of “Final Space” features gore, indicating that some mature content is ahead. But the show also goes for comedy when a cookie strikes the protagonist Gary in the face, causing him to misfire his laser gun. It sets up the expectation that the show will combine adult themes and childish shenanigans, all within one animated show. However, TBS’s new show fails to execute on both accounts, suffering from weak characterization and a limited arsenal of punchlines.
In the opening minutes of the show, we see Gary (Olan Rogers), an exiled space criminal, floating through space on his last minutes of oxygen. Gary, in a state of near-death makes the show come off as much more serious than it actually is. However, the more screen time Gary gets, the less seriously we take him. Gary is fast-talking and aggressively friendly, traits that could make a quality protagonist if not for the poor writing. Gary’s dialogue is meant to be the comedic core of the show, but consists mostly of yelling and repeating things (“Cookies? Cookies!”). The style of Rogers’ delivery makes it difficult to ever take Gary seriously, even in moments that are supposed to be dire. As he is informed by HUE (Tom Kenny), the ship’s A.I. system, that he is losing oxygen and will perish in less than 10 minutes, Gary remarks, “They went with green for red alert. I would’ve gone with red. Or perrywinkle. Or eggnog. I don’t even know if that’s a color but now I just want eggnog.” While this line could have worked if the entire sequence was meant to be comedic, it was set seconds prior to seeing Gary and multiple dead bodies that have been eviscerated by the harshness of outer space float by, creating a strange blend within one scene.
It is revealed in the first episode that Gary was sentenced to five years in interstellar solitary confinement as a result of a failed attempt at impressing a girl, Quinn (Tika Sumpter). Gary has only met Quinn one time, but he continues to send her video messages throughout his served time. While this is meant to open up a romantic storyline and show Gary’s persistence, it functions as forced exposition or a means for repeating the events of the episode with a slightly comedic spin. Additionally, as Quinn begins to forge her own storyline, we are constantly reminded of Gary’s obsession with her, which takes away from Quinn’s exploits in the sense that no matter what she gets up to, she will inevitably cross paths with Gary again.
The show relies heavily on overused character arcs. There is Avocato (Coty Galloway), a bounty hunter turned friend, whose only interest is saving his son from the evil overlord. The evil overlord in this case is the Lord Commander (David Tennant), a super-powered villain who is made fun of for his short stature. Then there is KVN (Fred Armisen), an annoying robot sidekick with a love of cookies. Due to the lack of character originality, the jokes and action sequences are far too predictable. It comes as no surprise when Avocato goes to rescue his son and is led into a trap, or when the Lord Commander kills one of his henchmen who made a joke at his expense. Additionally, the majority of KVN’s scenes consist of KVN doing something, and Gary proceeding to complain about how much he despises KVN. The lack of original peripheral characters does further damage to “Final Space,” as Gary cannot carry the show alone.
Despite a strong cast and an intriguing premise, “Final Space” feels like it is going nowhere. While there are still some mysterious elements to the show, the arcs of the characters are not compelling enough for viewers to be interested in uncovering them. Not all television needs to be groundbreaking, but quality TV begins and ends with consistent, strong, or likable characters, and “Final Space” features no such individuals.

“No, we don’t wear leaves. No, we don’t live in huts. And no, we don’t swim to school." When I first visited the U.S. mainland three years ago, these were my answers, all of which I assumed to be common sense to the students who asked me about my life at home.
I’m from American Samoa. And if you don’t know where that is (don’t worry, 99.9 percent of people I’ve met in the U.S. mainland don’t either), it’s a small archipelago of seven islands located in the South Pacific. With a population of around just over 57,000 people, my home spans only about 76 square miles, and it is quite literally a dot on the map. Given our “tininess,” it was never my expectation that everyone in the mainland would know every little detail about my home or my culture. But I figured that they would have at least heard of us, considering the word “American” in American Samoa, and known enough not to ask such ignorant questions.
But barely anyone seems to know where American Samoa is, or is even able to name more than two island groups in the Pacific for that matter. The extent to which most people understand life in the Pacific is encapsulated by Disney’s 2016 major animated film Moana, which is the story of a Polynesian girl who goes on a long voyage to save the fictional island of Motunui—a place some have actually assumed to be my home. Why is there such little understanding of life in the Pacific among students on the U.S. mainland? Could it be because Pacific Islanders only make up a fraction of a percentage of the U.S. population? Or is it maybe because we’re separated from the mainland by the vast Pacific Ocean?
No. The reason why the Pacific islands remain one big mystery is because we have been nearly erased from American textbooks. Growing up under a curriculum designed by the U.S. Department of Education, it was hard for me to visualize a place for people like me outside of my island home.
In elementary school geography, we were taught that the world is made up of only seven continents: North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Europe, Antarctica, and Australia. I quickly learned that our islands belonged to none of these, instead falling under the unnamed loose conglomeration of tiny specks in the Pacific Ocean. In middle school science, I was taught about scientists from all over the world and their contributions, like Galileo and the invention of the telescope.
Yet, somehow the incredible advances of Polynesian star navigation and wayfinding never quite made the cut. In high school world history, I was taught about the rise and fall of great empires such as the Roman Empire. But not once was America’s dethroning of Hawaii’s Queen Liliuokalani or Independent Samoa’s long “Mau” Movement toward independence from New Zealand ever mentioned. Instead, the sliver of a section that we were most graciously allotted in their historical textbooks painted us as the “savages” that Western colonization had transformed into the “civilized.”
So, you see, we have been ostracized from the beginning––not because of our small population and not because of the vast Pacific Ocean that divides us. It is because of this double standard—the double standard that requires us to learn everything about the Western world, but does not require the Western world to learn anything about us.
And, so a clear message is reinforced into the minds of the children of the Pacific. We are lesser. We have no place amongst the rest of the world, especially in higher education—where our students have been disadvantaged and neglected. The reinforced image of Pacific Islanders as less competent or significant has made it hard for us to visualize ourselves in the college arena, with only 18 percent of the adult Pacific Islander population having a bachelor’s degree.
Hoping to counter this image and find my place at Harvard, I have still not been able to shake this persistent feeling of insignificance and invisibility. A place prided on celebrating diversity and inclusivity, Harvard falls short of including Pacific Islanders in that celebration. The language department, which boasts an array of courses in languages from around the world, has excluded all Pacific Islander languages. And on top of this, there are barely any spaces for Pacific Islanders to share their diverse cultures with the Harvard community.
Our poor representation in education needs to be recognized and addressed. Now more than ever is the time for us to take control of our own narrative and create spaces for our voices to be heard. Because we are more than the dot on your maps, and we are much more complex than the one page descriptions in your textbooks. We must recognize that we are not lesser, in order to stop being invisible.

On Feb. 14, seventeen students and faculty members were killed in a horrific mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. In the wake of this massacre, Dean of the School of Public Health Michelle Williams issued a statement to HSPH affiliates calling for an end to the federal restriction on most forms of gun violence research passed in  1996.
This provision, informally known as the Dickey Amendment, threatens to strip funding from government-funded agencies such as the Center for Disease Control if they conduct any research intended to “advocate or promote gun control.” At the same time that the law was passed, Congress lowered the CDC’s budget by the exact same amount it spent on such research. The Dickey Amendment functions as a gag rule, inhibiting the CDC from utilizing its highly trained public health researchers to combat what has become a uniquely American epidemic of gun-related deaths. We strongly support Williams’ stance against the Dickey Amendment and hope that her statement will help lead to substantive increases in research funding.
In light of a seemingly endless news cycle of mass shootings and gun violence, we believe that the federal government must support research on what has become a public health and safety crisis. To move forward and better protect our fellow citizens, the issue of preventing gun violence must be moved out of the sphere of political talking points and into the realm of nonpartisan, academically rigorous research. For this transition to occur, we need scientific evidence. And while private research institutions have attempted to fill the void left by the Dickey Amendment, its effect remains far-reaching and devastating.
The Dickey Amendment has wrongfully stymied publicly-funded research on gun violence research for over twenty years. We find it telling that even Jay Dickey, a key proponent of the provision, has since reversed his position and called for increased funding for gun violence research in 2015. Scientific research should not be politicized, especially when it could be used as a potent tool to save lives and reduce gun violence.
We hope that Williams and other Harvard leaders lobby our lawmakers and counter the heinous actions of the National Rifle Association, which has bankrolled the campaigns of many prominent politicians, disincentivizing them from making any effort to decrease gun violence beyond “thoughts and prayers.” Thoughts and prayers are not enough when lives are at stake. We need more funding, we need more research, and, ultimately, we need better laws.
Additionally, we hope that Williams’s public advocacy is followed by clear, strong, concrete actions to increase sorely needed research in this area. We recognize that change in the public sphere can be slow, and it may be years before the CDC will receive funding again for research on gun violence. In the meantime, Harvard should seek ways to privately fund gun control research.
Gun violence should not be a partisan issue. While William’s stance on gun violence research may seem political, this is merely a symptom of us living in a society that has turned what should be a nonpartisan issue—our overwhelming number of gun-related deaths in comparison with any other developed country—into a politicized debate. Academic research into gun violence can and should strive to be to be nonpartisan and non-biased, seek out solutions that objectively work, and hopefully, ensure that Parkland was America’s last school shooting.

Faith is an extraordinarily difficult concept to discuss, write about, and legislate on. By its very nature, it refuses to conform to the ways of this world. It dares to say that something (or someone) unseen or untouched or unheard could be vastly more meaningful that what we can see and touch and hear. It dares to say that the world is not as it should be, that we are called to something much more sublime than the societal status quo.
For people of many traditions, faith is not simply another interest or activity. It is not a competing viewpoint, worldview, or lens, but the very compass that orients us to ourselves, to others, and to the divine. As C.S. Lewis once wrote of his Christian faith, “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.”
Faith can be a simple matter. But it can also be a matter of immense complexity and nuance. It can demand intellectual rigor on a level rivaled by few academic disciplines. If we are to reckon substantively and meaningfully with faith, we must bring hearts and minds ready to challenge and be challenged, push and be pushed, listen and be heard.
The events of the past few weeks at the College have shown that many of us are not up to such a task. In the wake of Harvard College Faith and Action’s hosting of a controversial speaker, revelations about the circumstances in which one of their student leaders was asked to step down, the imposition of “administrative probation” from the College, and the Undergraduate Council’s condemnation of HCFA, the past few weeks have posed a major challenge to the future of faith at Harvard. The outcry and outrage, though, reflects the College’s incapability to engage faith with the nuance and complexity it often requires.
The Crimson Editorial Board chose a “race to the bottom” tactic of branding HCFA and its leaders as hateful, a tactic which has the strategic effect of putting an end to all reasonable discourse. Once you brand someone with such a red-hot label, you cannot un-brand them. “You’re just full of hate” is not a statement that can be engaged or reasoned with. This was a dangerous, sensationalizing move.
The UC condemned the organization and refused to invite its co-presidents to a Sunday “Community Time,” a space presumably with the intent of fostering conversation and dialogue even on difficult Harvard issues. The Finance Committee Chair was quite callous in his swaggering “not gonna be getting a dime from us” exposition on stopping HCFA’s funding from that committee. And of course, the College was initially less than clear on the details of what “administrative probation” actually means.
The issues and policies at play are not nearly as black and white as any of these actors seem to believe. There is a real difference between asking a faith leader to step down because of their sexual orientation, and asking a faith leader to step down because of genuine theological disagreement over how we ought to live. There is a real difference between external ministry fellows influencing and coordinating activity in a Harvard student group, and external ministry fellows with seminary degrees providing pastoral care and spiritual mentorship to Harvard students.
I firmly believe a battle for the soul of the College is about to ensue. These are issues that will not be ferreted away by the fickle collegiate news cycle. The question in play is of the greatest magnitude: May campus religious organizations govern themselves according to their values without retribution? The largest Christian fellowship at the world’s foremost university is being sanctioned. That is no small matter.
A matter of faith with such extraordinary implications must not be approached with platitudes, close-mindedness, stubborn dogmatism, and incivility. Neither, though, should it be approached with fear or timidity. On the contrary, we should not fear to be bold. But so far, we have proven ourselves utterly unworthy of the challenge of difficult discussions on intensely important questions.
In all of the hysterical noise regarding HCFA recently, though, there have bright spots, reasoned and empathic voices bridging the gap between those in and out of faith traditions. The recent Crimson op-eds of Veronica S. Wickline ’16 and Tyler S. Parker ’17 reflect the standard of level-headedness, empathy, reason, and personal poignancy that can indeed accompany such an intensely challenging issue.
I believe Wickline frames the issue best, writing “If Harvard wants to enforce its view of how Christian communities should operate, let it understand the debate it is entering.” To this I would add an exhortation from the book of Isaiah: “Come now, and let us reason together...” What Harvard has done to HCFA is far from reasonable.

The numbers are shocking: $1,775 for a one bedroom apartment, and climbing. Securitas guard Aryt Alasti says rent for his tiny Massachusetts Ave. dwelling will swell to $1,875 by August.
Alasti has moved three times since relocating to Cambridge in the 1990s. His latest abode, not far from the nucleus of Harvard Square, is his most expensive yet.
“My co-workers are aghast when they hear what I’m paying,” he says. “None of them live in proximity to Harvard. Those who own homes live in other towns.”
A security guard stationed in Memorial Hall, Alasti has been at the University for nearly 23 years. He speaks to me with a mix of incredulity and resignation. The rising number printed on his monthly rent bill no longer carries the same shock factor.
Very few of Harvard’s unionized employees live right in the shadow of the university’s campus. Housing around the Square, like retail space, is at a premium. Even if a worker were to secure local housing, some say rental prices would be unsustainable even for the most frugal resident.
This is why Alasti believes he is one of the only, if not the only, support staff member occupying the apartment building he resides in. Rising rent prices have made living near Harvard Square infeasible. According to Alasti, a mix of wealthy mid-career tenants and well-off graduate students comprise the community in his building.
Employees like Alasti, who are contracted through Securitas, are represented by the local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, which includes in its membership many of Harvard’s janitorial and security staff. Aside from the local SEIU chapter, the other two dominant unions on campus are UNITE HERE Local 26 (which represents dining workers) and Harvard University Clerical and Technical Workers.
The benefits Alasti receives from the University differ slightly from what the average unionized employee receives, but in terms of wages and health care, the contracts for both types of employees are nearly indistinguishable. And regardless of their union affiliation, many of Harvard’s service workers face the same struggle to find affordable housing in the Cambridge area.
***
It wasn’t always nearly impossible for Harvard’s workers to live nearby.
Until 1995, rent control was the law of the land. Even though Alasti resided in prime territory—a building just midway between Harvard Yard and the Radcliffe Quadrangle—his monthly housing costs were kept low by city-wide limits on the amount of rent that could be charged for properties constructed prior to 1969.
“When I first moved here, rent control was in effect, so costs were quite low,” Alasti says.
Massachusetts residents voted in 1995 to terminate rent control policies across the state. In the 10 years afterwards, the valuation of properties in Cambridge exploded; the National Bureau of Economic Research estimates that property values ballooned by 1.8 billion between 1994 and 2004, and have been growing steadily since then. As value returned to the region, rental prices mounted, and Alasti soon found himself saddled with a hefty monthly bill.
To keep up with his rent, which he says was increasing by as much as $100 per year after the 1995 referendum on controls, Alasti increased his workload to seven nights a week at Harvard. He bounced between locations on campus—for a few years working at Harvard Business School, then transferring briefly to the Museum of Natural History, and later to the Graduate School of Design’s Gund Hall. He never intended to stay at Harvard for as long as he has. He says the work he did at the Business School was tiresome, and he calls the first winter he experienced in Cambridge “extreme” and a “very tiring experience.”
From nine to five every day, Alasti managed his own business endeavor: a landscaping company. At night, he would return to Harvard for his security shift. The strain of juggling two time-intensive and physically demanding jobs wore on him quickly.
Bill Jaeger, the director of the Harvard University Clerical and Technical Workers—the university’s largest campus union—also moved to Cambridge during the era of rent control. He says finding a place to live was, at the time, a “piece of cake.” He rented an apartment 20 minutes from Harvard Square that made up for what it lacked in square footage by its ideal proximity to campus.
Jaeger says the unit he stayed in was not rent controlled, but the building itself was. (If an owner stays in a property in their portfolio, at least two other units in that property are not subject to rent control). He says he paid a comparable price because the market would not allow landlords to charge that much more than the rate for a rent controlled apartment.
At the time, younger workers would eye neighborhoods in the nearby town of Somerville for affordable living situations. “You could find quirky places that were not outrageously expensive,” Jaeger says, in parts of East Cambridge, Mid-Cambridge, Central and Davis Squares.
That was nearly 30 years ago. He fears, now, that members of the union are staring down a reality in which even the smallest apartments in neighborhoods once affordable for an average employee will be too high of an ask.
***
I meet Jaeger at 15 Mt. Auburn St., and it’s pouring. I sandwich myself between the screen door and the building’s entrance, waiting for someone to buzz me in.
The HUCTW building is nondescript. It’s clear the property was once residential and was converted into office space. Three stories.
Jaeger tells me to wait for him in the reception area, a small room hidden slightly by a staircase. It’s furnished with red chairs, and the walls are plastered with newspaper clippings and vintage photographs of the “We Can’t Eat Prestige” movement, a push led mostly by women at Harvard to form a union in the 1970s and ’80s. A small table with four or five copies of freelance reporter John Hoerr’s chronicle of the movement completes this miniature shrine.
Jaeger tells me to help myself to anything in the kitchen while he finishes up a few emails, but I decline because The Crimson has a policy against accepting anything from sources you are interviewing. Jaeger knows this—we became acquainted nearly two years ago, when I first began reporting on labor issues for the paper. But his Midwestern upbringing means he’ll offer anyways.
“We used to talk about the ‘Harvard employee dream’ as a version of or a revision of the American Dream. [It] was to go from living in a shared group house where you’ve got half a shelf in the refrigerator to having your own apartment. But that’s sort of a 10 year old idea,” Jaeger says. “I’d say with continuing, relentless increases in housing costs, the contemporary, 2018 version of that is, ‘Can a 20-something Harvard staff member afford to find a spot in a shared group house situation anywhere reasonably close?’” Jaeger considers a “40-minute commute” to campus reasonable.
“I’m a great Arlington example because my wife and I saved money pretty vigorously and were able to buy a pretty small, single family house right on the Arlington-Cambridge line,” Jaeger says. After the era of rent control, he sought out a modestly sized house in Arlington, Massachusetts, where he and his wife have raised their two children. “If we were careful and sacrificed a little bit, it wasn’t brutally difficult to afford.”
“It’s just completely not possible to do the same kind of thing now; the trajectory that I followed 30 years ago is not available, and that was on a kind of regular Harvard support staff salary,” Jaeger adds.
Jaeger says that in the last decade, employees have fanned out from Harvard Square. He adds that they search for housing across the river and find purchase in some of Boston’s more affordable neighborhoods like Roxbury or Jamaica Plain, while others go even further, braving a daily commute between Cambridge and suburbs of Boston like Belmont and Watertown that can last up to an hour on congested days.
Sandy M. Sousa, a dining services worker in Cabot dining hall, says she and her husband commute from Tewksbury, an area about 10 minutes out from the New Hampshire border and a 45 minutes or longer drive from Harvard.
“Every morning, I bring him down to work, or he takes his car for the 45 minutes down,” Sousa says. “Driving back up, I have my kids I take care of until I have to go to work.”
Sousa grew up near Harvard in Somerville, but says it’s unlikely she’ll ever return to the area because of the rent she’d have to pay to live near Harvard. The rent at her two-bedroom Tewksbury apartment is $1,035 per month — a significantly lower figure than what Alasti says he pays for a single-bedroom unit near Harvard Square. Though rent is cheaper, the time Sousa spends on the road is a significant sacrifice, she says.
Jaeger also reflects on this difficult choice between which sacrifice to make. “It’s sort of a perversion of reality to think people are sort of deciding where they’re going to live,” he says. “Our members don’t decide where they’re going to live. They engage in a frantic search and take a really painful set of trade offs and compromises.”
Employees at Harvard aren’t the only ones grappling with this issue. Local 26, the dining workers union, also represents other workers in the region, including the dining staff at Northeastern University. Several workers I spoke with say they are unable to afford living in close proximity to the school’s campus. When the union began bargaining with Northeastern’s food distributor, Chartwells, for new benefits at the start of the academic year, cost of living concerns were at the forefront of the discussion.
Thomas Gross, a chef in Northeastern’s international-themed dining hall, works two jobs to keep up with his monthly housing bills. He lives in Roxbury, one of Boston’s low-income neighborhoods, but nonetheless a neighborhood where rental properties are increasing in value.
The living situation itself is not ideal, he says. Violence in the neighborhood is commonplace and Gross, who has a seven-year-old daughter, says he often fears for her safety when she’s out playing in a nearby park.
“We shouldn’t have to worry about public assistance just to get by, or having to work two jobs to just provide for our families,” Gross says.
Workers at Northeastern agitated towards the end of 2017 for a wage increase that would bring the minimum salary for full-time employees up to $35,000, a number that Gross said would allow many staff members to live “comfortably.”
“I know it ain’t gonna make me rich, but it’ll help us workers give us the benefit of comfort to be able to have and spend, to pay our bills and live in better neighborhoods,” he says. “It’ll be good leverage for me to move to a better environment, and I’ll be able to provide more for my family.”
Gross aspires to move outside of Boston proper, perhaps to Milton or to Hyde Park. He has a brother who lives in Dedham to whom he looks for inspiration. “He lives near a pool, he has like four kids, and they’re loving it.”
***
Over the years, some students, workers, and activists have raised the question: what more should Harvard do to solve the problem, if anything?
In 2001, Harvard students in tandem with campus unions tried to answer that question with the Living Wage Campaign, an effort to convince Harvard to supply wage increases that could keep pace with the rising cost of living in the Boston metropolitan area.  Alasti was part of that fight. But union leaders say there’s little more the university can do to assuage the pressure the city’s housing crisis places on its employees.
HUCTW—which has more than 5,000 members—places the cost of living at the forefront of its efforts to improve worker conditions at Harvard. To the outsider, it may seem like wage increases are the easiest path towards addressing the housing problem, but Jaeger says the union understands it’s unlikely a negotiated wage hike will completely offset annual rental increases.
“We don’t dare to dream about negotiating comprehensive solutions or dramatic sweeping answers to the really difficult problem of housing costs in this region through our union’s negotiations with the university,” Jaeger says. “I think it’s a big, prosperous, powerful institution, but I think it’s fair to say this is a problem which is even bigger than that.”
When Harvard negotiates with its unions, it typically agrees to scheduled wage increases that stay ahead of the projected rate of inflation. In HUCTW’s most recent contract, ratified in January 2016, the union secured a pay schedule that increased wages in October 2016 and 2017. Union members also received a retroactive pay increase for 2015.
Jaeger says that unions work with the university to find “creative” and “incremental” solutions to alleviate the financial burden.
For example, HUCTW’s joint committee on housing and transportation ironed out a partnership with the Harvard University Employees Credit Union that provides no-interest loans to some of HUCTW’s members when they are transitioning between rental situations. The funds are intended to help cover expenses like the start-up costs involved with moving from one place to another.
Before unions can find small ways to alleviate the pressure of housing costs, they face the hurdle of communicating the severity of the situation to some Harvard affiliates.
In recent years, HUCTW has found creative ways to hammer home these points. In its most recent round of negotiations in 2015, HUCTW enlisted the aid of a computer programmer working out of Google’s office in Kendall Square to digitally render a map of the region correlating rental prices and T stops. Jaeger says the map was helpful in explaining how interrelated transportation and housing affordability are.
HUCTW also conducts a survey of its members when preparing for an upcoming round of contract negotiations. The union asks members for certain quantitative information about their housing experience. Members can also include qualitative descriptors, which are then read at the negotiating table.
Aryt Alasti is the sort of unexpected Harvard insider who, while he may not carry an administrative title, has had his finger on Harvard’s pulse long enough and has encountered enough affiliates to know what’s going on. He jokes with me that he’s been working at Harvard long enough that, in the event he faces a sudden windfall and ends up on the streets, he’ll have a Rolodex full of contacts to rely on for support.
While it is unlikely Alasti will end up homeless anytime soon, he says he’s feeling the pressure of rising rental costs. He hopes to move to Hawaii sometime in the future.
“It would have to involve something about a source of income that is not tied to locale,” he says. “I’m living in a way that doesn’t make sense for anybody with my income level.”

UPDATED: March 9, 2018 at 2:03 a.m.
Tami A. Christopher calls me on the phone because she lives all the way in Connecticut.
She’s a Harvard graduate student earning her Doctor of Education Leadership (Ed.L.D.). She’s also a single mom to two kids, now 10 and 13.
Christopher initially lived in a one-bedroom apartment in the Harvard-owned Holden Green complex. It was a 15-minute walk from HGSE.
“I absolutely loved it,” she says. “I would have preferred to stay there, to be quite honest. It would have been better for my educational experience, and I did want my kids to have an ability to experience life in Cambridge and the schools in Cambridge.”
Christopher, though, was undergoing a custody case at the time. “I needed to get a two-bedroom apartment to have the best chance of getting the kids to stay with me permanently,” she says. “But my cost would have jumped from $1,695 a month to a minimum of $2,200 a month, and I just couldn’t swing that.”
Ultimately, Christopher had no choice but to move back to her home in Meriden, Conn. The decision actually ended up saving her money. She laughs that “it’s actually costing me less to live in Connecticut with an 1,800-square foot house with a yard and parking than it was to live a 15 minute walk away.”
Christopher schedules her courses so that she only has to drive to campus two or three days per week. The commute is about two hours each way. She uses the time to listen to podcasts or catch up on phone calls.
“I do miss out on certain parts of my program,” she says. “I don’t drive two hours for the various workshops or presentations that are offered.”
While Christopher’s particular situation is somewhat unusual, her concerns about housing affordability are not. According to Zumper, a real estate site, Cambridge rent prices for a one or two bedroom apartments are the most expensive in the Boston area.
Some of Harvard’s graduate students, like Christopher, come to campus with families of their own. Others arrive unmarried and straight out of college. Regardless, because of the high prices of Cambridge housing, graduate students are often forced to live in uncertain territory during their multi-year stints at Harvard—moving frequently, living with many roommates, or commuting long distances to campus.
This unconventional lifestyle reflects what some call the precariousness of being a graduate student. As evident in the public debates over unionization, graduate students are difficult to classify. They’re somewhere between working adult professionals and developing scholars: both paid employees for and pupils of the University. The occupation exists in an undefined space.
Jack M. Nicoludis, a chemistry graduate student living in Somerville and a Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers organizer, recently looked at Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences website to figure out the cost of living in the area. He found that Harvard’s estimated living expenses for a single student in an off-campus apartment totaled to $2,865 per month.
“As a graduate student in the sciences, I’m making about $2,600 a month after taxes. That’s about $265 a month that, according to the university’s calculations, I shouldn’t be able to afford,” he says. “Where does the university expect that money to come from?”
In an emailed statement, Ann P. Hall, the Director of Communications for GSAS, wrote that “the GSAS Office of Residential Life manages four residence halls, which provide affordable, on-campus housing for graduate students.”
The housing rule of thumb dictates that people should spend a third of their income on rent. That percentage is often far higher for Harvard graduate students. Kate M. Franz, a graduate of Harvard Medical School who lived in Brookline and Boston, estimates that about 40 to 50 percent of her stipend went to rent.
“It’s definitely a seller’s market,” Nicoludis says. “Because there’s so many students, the schedule is set up to have 80 percent of the leases start Sept. 1. So it’s very competitive for Sept. 1 rents. We signed our lease in May, because you have to look so early to find places since they’re gone by the middle of the summer.”
Starting the house hunt that far in advance poses a challenge for graduate students who arrive from out of state. If students can’t secure housing before the summer, they might be left in the dust in a market that operates around the academic calendar.
Anna Ivanova, a third-year Ph.D. student, moved from Moscow to Boston with her husband in August 2015. They found themselves in an unexpected bind. “We had this feeling that everyone’s already moving, renting a place,”  Ivanova says. “All the apartments were booked.”
Ultimately, Ivanova and her husband found housing in Fenway “at the very last minute.” Though the location wasn’t convenient, there seemed to be nothing else available.
Even when graduate students like Ivanova can find affordable living, their rents continue to climb. After rent control was abolished in 1994 by a Massachusetts statewide ballot referendum, prices hiked drastically—and they’re still rising. Between 2015 and 2016, The Crimson reported that the rental rate for single-bedroom apartments in the Cambridge Riverside area increased by 17 percent.
For many graduate students, the rate at which their rent rises outpaces their annual stipend increase—typically a 3 percent cost-of-living adjustment based on inflation. This past year, because the endowment underperformed, the stipend increased by only 1.5 percent.
Yesterday, GSAS announced that during the 2018-2019 academic year, stipends will earn a 3 percent increase. That increase was calculated over several months through the annual student financial aid budgeting process. GSAS leadership meets with graduate students and the Graduate Student Council about their needs regularly.
If renting an apartment can be hard, buying a house can be even harder.
Thomas M. Jamison, an International History Ph.D. candidate, decided last year that he wanted to purchase a home with his wife. But they encountered unexpected difficulties. “At first, no one wanted to give me a loan because I was a graduate student with no guaranteed income,” Jamison says.
“That’s one of the bad things about being a grad student,” Jamison reflects. “It’s one of the few jobs where as a young professional with an advanced degree, you’re not in a position to accumulate wealth or invest in a 401k or in the equity of your home.”
Erin M. Hutchinson, a History Ph.D. candidate and union organizer, ushers me into her one-bedroom apartment in Haskins Hall, a Harvard housing complex. It’s cramped at the entrance; I almost knock over a drying rack. But the interior of the apartment is spacious. There’s a living room, a bedroom, a bathroom, and a kitchen. The refrigerator is plastered with stickers and the shelves are well-stocked. She notes there isn’t a dishwasher or disposal.
It costs about $2,000 per month, she tells me. “It’s only affordable because I have a partner that I can share it with,” she explains. (Her boyfriend is a physics graduate student.) It’s visibly home to two academics; the shelves are stacked with books, and I notice “National Ideology Under Socialism” lying on the coffee table. There’s a large record player in the corner.
“We are really happy,” she says. “If you call maintenance, they come the same day or the next day. I’m definitely paying for the quality.”
Harvard currently houses over 7,000 graduate students in University-owned housing and recently added more than 700 graduate beds, according to a 2017 Crimson article. Together, that accounts for about 48 percent of the University’s expanding graduate population of 15,250 and counting.
Housing comes in two main forms: residence halls, which are on-campus dorms, and Harvard University housing, which are apartments that students can rent.
Not all graduate students say they are happy with Harvard housing—often because it can be market price or slightly above.
For the residence halls, students must purchase the meal plan, which is $2,379 per year plus a declining balance allotment of over $650. “I can go to Broadway Market and get a sandwich for $7,” Patrick R. McCoy explains. “It just wasn’t the best financial option.” During the first year of his Celtic Languages and Literature Ph.D., McCoy lived in the dorm Perkins Hall.
The apartments, on the other hand, aren’t subsidized at all, a fact which some graduate students say they find surprising. “[Subsidies are] often the case with university housing everywhere,” says Byron M. Davies, who recently graduated with a philosophy Ph.D. and also organized with the union. “For example, Columbia—because rent in the city is insane—their housing for graduate students is subsidized. Students wouldn’t be able to afford to live there otherwise. Cambridge rents are getting more and more expensive, more and more comparable to something like New York. Why is Harvard not doing that?”
Hall wrote in an email that, “Outside of GSAS, Harvard University Housing offers a wide variety of properties with heat, hot water, electricity, and gas included in the rent. At some locations, air conditioning and/or Internet service are also included. No security deposit, application fee, or finder’s fee are required, and rents are conveniently paid by student term bill.”
Even if students want Harvard housing, some say it is at times available in limited supply. Kadeem J. Gilbert, a graduate student in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology department, wanted to live in University housing during his sixth year. He entered the lottery system, but before his viewing window arrived, he says he received an email saying, “All the housing options were already occupied.”
Now he’s living in a Somerville studio previously occupied by a member of his department. The kitchen and the living area bleed into the bedroom. Most notably, his room is littered with plants. “These aren’t the plants I study,” Gilbert clarifies. He rattles off their names: sea onions, rosemary, aroids, and even a cactus.
Some graduate students felt like they lacked knowledge while they sought out a place to live. “It’s more sink or swim,” Gilbert says.
But there are existing resources available to students. The GSAS has an Office of Residential Life that provides resources for locating off-campus housing and other pertinent information about moving companies and storage facilities. In an emailed statement, Hall wrote that the office staff “assist graduate students who are searching for housing by directing them to resources at Harvard and in the Cambridge-Boston area.”
Jack Nicoludis opens the door to his yellow Somerville home. I am immediately greeted by a black-and-white cat that brushes up against my legs. “That’s Chicken,” Nicoludis says. “He’s friendly. There’s another cat upstairs named Leo—that one’s a little bit more shy.”
We climb an impossibly narrow spiral staircase to reach Nicoludis’s bedroom on the third floor. “Watch out for the railing on your right,” he says. “It’s loose.” His room is essentially an attic; the bed is centered between slanted ceilings, with a tiny fake tree to the left.
After the perilous journey to his bedroom, we return to the second-floor seating area. It’s decorated like a bachelor pad—on a graduate student budget. I sit next to a makeshift bar with different types of alcohol and a sign that says, “So this is a Harvard bar, huh? I thought there’d be equations and shit on the wall.” Nicoludis tells me it’s his favorite quote from “Good Will Hunting.”
“The benefit of living with five people is that it’s cheaper,” Nicoludis says. “We pay $760 a month to $1,100, and I think that’s a bit on the lower range of what people pay.”
For him, this is a pretty ideal living situation. “I’m a pretty social person, so I like having people around and coming home after work to an apartment where we can all hang out in the living room,” he says. “I really enjoy having my roommates be my friends.”
“I don’t know many grad students that live alone,” Nicoludis adds. “I don’t think it’s affordable… The only people I know that live alone have some support from their family… or are living with their partner.”
The Harvard University Housing webpage calls living with peers “a great way to reduce your housing costs”; they even offer an online portal where students can search for roommates.
For some graduate students entering their 30s, however, this style of communal living is one they’ve outgrown since their undergraduate years.
“It doesn’t really work for me personally to have roommates anymore at this point in my life,” Gilbert says. “I’m really clean, I have really particular standards, and I like to work at home.” Though he lived with a roommates for a year, he’s reverted back to living in his own studio—even if it costs more.
Christian B. Schlegel travels to campus from out of state. He sits across from me in a bright rainbow shirt and round glasses. For the first two years of his English Ph.D., he lived in Somerville. As his rent crept from $900 towards $1,000, he began to explore cheaper housing options.
Now, he commutes from Providence, R.I. “It was partly financial and partly just wanting to explore another place,” he explains. The journey to campus is two hours door-to-door, and he makes that trip twice a week. It’s a straight shot on the commuter rail.
Schlegel notes this is made much easier because Harvard subsidizes half the cost of a semesterly MBTA pass. Now, he’s only paying $150 of commuting fees per semester.
In an emailed statement, Hall wrote that GSAS administrators “meet regularly” with the Graduate Student Council, and that the MBTA subsidy came out of conversations with council members. “At one meeting, student leaders asked GSAS to consider increasing the subsidy on MBTA semester passes to 50 percent. GSAS agreed,” she wrote.
Thomas M. Jamison and his wife purchased their home in Waltham.
“One’s housing allowance from the University goes so much farther soon as you just get over the border of Cambridge. The downside of that? My life is run around the vicissitudes of the train system,” he muses. “I can’t tell you how many times I’ve had to run out of a faculty dinner because I have to catch a train.”
Jamison takes the Fitchburg line of the commuter rail from Waltham to Porter Square, and then the red line to Harvard Square. During his very first week, he recalls that his train stopped between Waverly and Belmont for about 30 minutes. Fortunately, his schedule was flexible that day, but he remembered thinking, “Wow, if I had an appointment or a class I just would have missed it.” Now, he says, “I always come an hour or two early so I don’t miss my commitments.”
To avoid being “at the mercy of the commuter rail,” Jamison prefers to bike five miles into Cambridge. “My bike is never late,” he laughs.
Jamison wryly acknowledges the irony of his scheduling difficulties. “Waltham’s biggest industry was forever the clock,” he says. “When I think about the famous Waltham watch company, it’s a bitter irony that the train is always fucking late—I take a little bit of poetic justice from that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted to include the College’s penalties on members of single-gender social groups in the student handbook Tuesday, ending more than a year and a half of turmoil and ensuring once and for all that the controversial sanctions are here to stay.
The handbook vote posed the final hurdle in what has been a tumultuous path to finalization and legitimacy for the College’s social group policy, which bars members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from campus leadership positions, the captaincies of varsity athletic teams, and from receiving College endorsement for certain fellowships.
University President Drew G. Faust debuted the penalties in May 2016—but after faculty charged they had not had sufficient input in crafting the policy, administrators formed at least two committees charged with the power to review, revise, and even replace the sanctions. Faculty members also at times offered vocal opposition to the penalties in the form of anti-sanctions legislation, speeches, and posts online and on social media.
But ultimately, the sanctions survived unscathed—the committees did not alter the penalties and the anti-sanctions legislation failed to pass. Now, almost the exact text of the original policy Faust announced in 2016 is enshrined for the foreseeable future in the student handbook.
The Faculty voted to include the sanctions in the handbook with little fanfare at the March iteration of its monthly meeting. The vote was verbal—not balloted—with Faculty casting their votes by saying either “Aye” or “Nay.”
The Aye’s outnumbered the Nay’s, and so the sanctions entered the handbook.
The policy’s inclusion in the handbook means in part that students will not have to sign an oath specifically affirming their commitment to the policy, as had been proposed at one point over the last year and a half.
The College released a long-awaited implementation plan for the sanctions last week, including plans to ask the Faculty to include them in the handbook. The plan revealed that the Administrative Board will be responsible for enforcing the finalized social group policy.
Former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68—a vocal opponent of the sanctions since their inception—questioned the Ad Board’s ability to enforce the policy at Tuesday’s meeting. He asked how the Ad Board would discover whether a student applying for or holding a leadership position is also a member of an unrecognized social organization.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alex Miller—who attended the meeting—responded on behalf of the Office of Student Life Thursday. He said that, as with all other Ad Board cases, social group cases will be “reactive.” He added the method through which the Ad Board will carry out the implementation will be up to the board.
Administrators have previously said the College will not enforce the sanctions by actively searching for students who violate the policy. Officials also said Harvard will not seek or act on “anonymous complaints” to discover violators.
Lewis also said at the meeting he thinks the language included in the handbook makes it unclear whether certain groups are to the sanctions. He specifically mentioned the Harvard Knights of Columbus and Daughters of Isabella, single-gender organizations hosted through the Harvard Catholic Center.
Miller said that, going forward, individual cases will depend on whether the organization is registered with the OSL or not.
Lewis has previously mounted opposition to the penalties. At various points he introduced two separate motions designed to kill the policy; neither ended up passing, the first because Lewis withdrew it.
Lewis’s second recent motion, introduced in fall 2017, stated the College shall not discipline students who join “any lawful organization.” Ultimately, after heated debate, the Faculty voted down his motion at the November meeting, when 130 professors voted against it while 90 supported it.
Biology professor and attendee David A. Haig said Thursday he also feels the handbook language touching on “unrecognized single-gender social organizations” is unclear. Furthermore, he questioned which fellowship endorsements would be subject to the policy.
“When we’re implementing the policy, students will want clarity,” Haig said. “Specifically, I’m not clear on what is a college-administered fellowship.”
Miller said the policy will only apply to scholarships awarded by the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A female alumnus reported an unarmed robbery to the Harvard University Police Department on Monday evening, according to a statement from HUPD.
The robbery was reported in Harvard Yard near Sever Hall at 6:59 PM that night. A man grabbed the woman from behind and stole her purse. She fell to the ground and her assailant fled the scene.
The victim could not give a description of her attacker and HUPD officers searched the area after the incident was reported but was unable to find the perpetrator. The attacker is unidentified and the investigation into the robbery is still ongoing.
In the statement, emailed to the Harvard community on Tuesday afternoon, HUPD urged anyone with information on the incident to contact the department. The statement also reminded students that “we are located in an urban setting and share many of the crime and safety issues that exist in any city.”
When asked for comment on the robbery, Steven G. Catalano, the department's Public Information Officer, restated HUPD’s policy of not commenting on ongoing investigations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students sent a letter to Government department faculty Tuesday condemning their handling of sexual assault accusations against Professor Jorge I. Dominguez and demanding the department take steps to address “years of apparent negligence” towards issues of sexual misconduct.
Dominguez sent an email to colleagues later that same day announcing he plans to retire at the end of the academic year and that he is resigning all administrative roles immediately.
Dominguez’s resignation—and the graduate students’ letter—comes days after the Chronicle of Higher Education reported on Feb. 27 that at least 18 women are accusing him of sexual harassment over a 30-year period. In response to the allegations, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced in an email Monday night that Dominguez would be placed on paid administrative leave pending Harvard’s “full and fair review” of the allegations against him.
The same day the graduate students sent the letter, government department administrators announced the department was undertaking several initiatives in response to the allegations against Dominguez. Many of the initiatives directly address demands made in the graduate students’ letter.
Government graduate students began work on the letter, coordinated in part by the department’s Diversity Working Group and signed by 107 students, following a meeting with Government Department Chair Jennifer L. Hochschild last Wednesday. Hochschild also met with undergraduate concentrators on Friday.

“We went into the meeting hoping for answers. We left disappointed, disillusioned, and, for many of us, angry,” students wrote in the letter. “The meeting communicated a message of equivocation, powerlessness, and an unwillingness to commit to addressing this issue or instituting any significant changes within the Department.”
The letter also alleges the department has demonstrated negligence in its handling of sexual harassment. Government Ph.D. student Joshua C. Simons, who worked with DWG on the letter, wrote in an email that the Dominguez case “raised issues of systemic and persistent sex inequality” within the department.
“The University and Government Department have burdened female students with impossible choices and unacceptably onerous responsibilities,” students wrote. “Do they work with someone who may violate their trust? Or do they risk their career by not doing so? Individual students should never have had to navigate this decision.”
While DWG’s past findings about diversity in the department are not public, the letter also alleges that Harvard’s Government department has “few[er] women faculty compared to peer institutions.”
Hochschild declined to comment Tuesday on the graduate students’ letter.
In addition to requesting Dominguez’s removal, graduate students called on the Government department to issue a statement condemning sexual assault, institute a formal process for victims to come forward, inform potential students of the allegations, and begin both internal and external reviews of the department’s policies toward “sexual harassment, gender disparities, and other forms of discrimination and abuse of power.”
Government department administrators including Hochschild sent an email to undergraduate concentrators announcing the creation of a “standing committee” to investigate the reasons why Dominguez’s behavior went largely unaddressed for 30 years.
The email also detailed several smaller initiatives meant to address academic and cultural concerns surrounding the Dominguez case. The department will hold a meeting on March 21 for undergraduates to address possible academic issues stemming from Dominguez’s retirement.
The email also contained the asked-for denunciation of sexual assault.
Graduate students who worked on the letter to faculty said they are dissatisfied with the department’s actions, both before and after the allegations against Dominguez became public.
"I was incredibly disappointed by the University's, and in particular the Government department's reaction to the Chronicle article. That said, I was not particularly surprised by it,” Government Ph.D. student Leah R. Downey wrote in an email. “Graduate students in our community have been working hard and speaking up about a culture of gender discrimination and harassment for years—to no avail.”
Government Ph.D. student Gabrielle Malina wrote in an email she is “deeply disappointed” in the University’s response to the Chronicle’s reporting.
“We hope that the department and administration will heed our requests to rectify this deafening silence by publicly apologizing for their behavior and condemning the reported abuse and harassment,” Malina wrote. “Anything else will send a devastating signal to women who are considering coming forward with their own claims.”
Hochschild also declined to comment on the graduate students’ claims.
The Diversity Working Group is currently working with Government graduate students and faculty to send a second letter to both University President Drew G. Faust and the community at large. That letter  will likely be released later this week.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 8, 2018 at 6:10 a.m.
The Government department is forming a “standing committee” to investigate the “conditions” that allowed Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez to remain active in the department for decades while allegedly sexually harassing at least 18 women throughout that time period.
Government department administrators announced the formation of the committee in a letter sent to undergraduate concentrators Tuesday afternoon. Administrators also outlined a series of steps the department is taking to address academic and cultural concerns surrounding the allegations of sexual harassment recently brought against Dominguez.
The letter comes several days after two reports published in The Chronicle of Higher Education detailing that at least 18 women are accusing Dominguez of repeated acts of sexual harassment over the last three decades.
“We are taking a hard look at the conditions that allowed this pattern of harassment to continue and that prevented it from coming to light,” the letter reads. “We recognize that the combination of the 1980s case, the pattern of allegations spanning decades, the failure of the pattern to come to light, and the important role in your education of effective and professional faculty mentors causes you great concern and has undermined your trust in the department.”
“We state unequivocally that the Department of Government will not tolerate sexual harassment,” the letter continues.
The letter was signed by Government department chair Jennifer L. Hochschild, Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch, and Chair of the Faculty Concentration Committee Danielle S. Allen.
Harvard first sanctioned Dominguez in 1983 after he made sexual advances towards former assistant professor Terry L. Karl and another graduate student. As punishment, then-Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky removed Dominguez from the administrative positions he then held.
In the more than 30 years since, though, Dominguez has held at least four major administrative positions, including the directorship of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs from 1995 to 2006. Dominguez announced Tuesday he will retire from his teaching job at the end of the semester and that he is immediately resigning the administrative roles he still holds at the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies.
Thirty years later, Harvard has also taken new steps to punish Dominguez, placing him on “administrative leave” Sunday and launching an investigation into the allegations against the government professor.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith has said Dominguez’s retirement will not affect the investigation.
The new committee will seek to develop a “deeper understanding of the conditions” that led to the Dominguez “situation” and will also create a “means for addressing them,” according to the letter.
The committee’s membership will include undergraduates, faculty, Ph.D. and post-doctoral students, and Harvard staff.
“Most generally, this committee will seek to address concerns about inappropriate power dynamics, gendered interactions, disruptive fear or anxiety, and other constraints on genuine discourse, learning, and free exchange of ideas,” Hochschild, Welch, and Allen wrote in their letter.
Though the committee is yet to be officially formed, some informal groups of faculty and students are already gathering to discuss changes that will take effect “in the near term,” according to the letter.
Hochschild, Welch, and Allen wrote that the committee’s creation is the first of many steps the department intends to take going forward to foster a “safe, healthy, and intellectually exciting environment” for all Government students.
Other initiatives listed in the letter include a planned meeting especially for undergraduate students pursuing Latin American studies—Dominguez’s field of expertise. The meeting, slated to take place March 21, will give attendees a forum to think about “curricular issues” as well as larger concerns over Dominguez.
The letter further encouraged any Government department affiliates who have seen or suffered sexual harassment at Harvard to come forward and share their experiences with Title IX coordinators. The encouragement echoes earlier calls from Harvard administrators, who last week asked students and faculty to speak up about sexual misconduct.
Finally, the letter assures students the Government department is working to resolve any problems with the “curriculum, advising, and organizational activity” that may arise from Dominguez’s decision to depart campus.
The letter came shortly after graduate students sent a letter about the Dominguez allegations to Government faculty Tuesday morning.
The graduate students’ letter specifically called for some of the steps later undertaken by the department, including both a public condemnation of sexual harassment and the creation of a departmental committee to investigate the Dominguez case.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction and clarification:
CLARIFICATION: March 8, 2018
A previous version of this article indicated the government department committee will examine how Professor Jorge I. Dominguez could have remained employed by Harvard while sexually harassing at least 18 women across the span of three decades. To clarify, the committee how Professor Dominguez was able to remain active in the government department while sexually harassing at least 18 women across the span of three decades. To be clear, the committee has no power over or ability to directly influence Professor Dominguez's employment status.
CORRECTION: March 7, 2018
Due to an editing error, a previous headline accompanying this article implied that the Government department formed a committee to investigate Professor Jorge I. Dominguez. In fact, the Government department formed a committee to investigate issues surrounding the department's climate that allowed Dominguez to remain employed by Harvard for decades after first facing sexual harassment accusations.

UPDATED: March 6, 11 p.m.
In an email to graduate students Monday evening, Interim Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Emma Dench announced that stipends for Ph.D. students will increase by 3 percent in the upcoming year.
The new number marks a return to historical rates after an unusually low increase of 1.5 percent last year, which GSAS Dean Xiao-Li Meng attributed to poor returns on Harvard’s endowment. Of the past nine years, eight have seen 3 percent increases.
“I am thrilled to announce this increase and want to thank my colleagues at GSAS and our partners across the University for their efforts to continue enhancing support for our students,” Dench wrote.
GSAS plans stipend rates in conjunction with the Graduate Student Council, which provides feedback to the School’s proposals.
“GSAS undergoes a financial aid budgeting process that takes several months and involves input from many constituents, including and most importantly students,” GSAS Dean for Finance and Administration Allen D. Aloise wrote in email. “Now that process is complete, we are pleased to be able to offer the increase.”
In 2016, Aloise previously wrote that factors taken into account for stipend increases include tuition grants, housing, and health care costs for students.
Sperling’s Best Places, a firm that provides cost of living indices for cities across the U.S., estimates that Cambridge’s score is 198, compared to a national average of 100. The cost of living near Harvard is also considerably higher than many peer institutions—New Haven scored of 107.7 and Hanover, NH scored 154.5.
Harvard University Housing announced in January that rents in University housing, where some graduate students live, will increase between zero and three percent next year.
Following last year’s low rate, graduate student unionization advocates cited lower increases as a reason collective bargaining would materially benefit graduate students. In an email to students, representatives from Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers expressed qualified support for this year’s increase, arguing that collective bargaining would protect wage stability in future years.

Nina Martin of ProPublica and Renee Montagne of NPR won the 2018 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting Tuesday for their series on maternal deaths in the United States.
“An underreported story with a devastatingly human angle, their report shines a light on a problem all around us, but rarely told with such power and grace,” Director of the Shorenstein Center Nicco Mele said in a press release Tuesday.
The Goldsmith Prize, which celebrates investigative reporting that “promotes more effective and ethical conduct of government,” debuted in 1991 and is administered by the Kennedy School’s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy. The award includes $25,000 for the winner and $10,000 for each of the other five finalists.
Finalists included stories by reporters at the Washington Post, the Miami Herald, Buzzfeed News, and the Asbury Park Press. The finalists investigated abuses in the juvenile justice system, exploitation of opioid addicts seeking treatment, and Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential election.
The New York Times also received a special citation for its reporting on sexual harassment, which Mele said led to a “social, cultural, and community reckoning” unlike anything he had ever seen.
During a panel at the Kennedy School before the awards ceremony, Martin discussed her personal experiences reporting on the winning story.
“In 2000, my sister gave birth in Texas to a healthy baby boy, but she nearly died in the process. I remember the trauma my family and I faced,” Martin said. “It struck me, especially because she had been told this kind of thing never happened to anyone.”
After joining ProPublica, Martin said her editor encouraged her to “go big” and investigate the growing rate of maternal mortality in the U.S. But with the lack of public data available on maternal complications, Martin found reporting on the issue to be challenging.
“Many states don’t even have maternal mortality review committees that count and analyze maternal deaths, and when they do, the data that they have is de-identified,” Martin said.
Martin and her colleague began combing through closed Facebook groups and GoFundMe to find stories of women who had died or nearly died in childbirth from maternal complications.
“We weren’t finding many cases of severe maternal morbidity reported in news stories,” Martin said. “Instead, we found maternal morbidity stories mostly in private chat groups on parenting websites, and also in closed Facebook groups.”
The series written by Martin and Montagne has promoted public awareness of maternal complications, in addition to inspiring legislation in New Jersey and Texas, according to the Shorenstein Center website.
At the event, Mele presented Martha Raddatz, ABC News chief global affairs correspondent and co-anchor of This Week with George Stephanopoulos, with the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism.
During her speech, Raddatz said the Goldsmith Prize finalists deserved the recognition for their tenacity in reporting on important issues  and encouraged them to continue their work.
“Go there, be there, feel it, smell it, know it from the inside out, and then report it.”

Upperclassmen in the Houses are busily planning for Thursday's Housing Day festivities, when a campus-wide celebration will welcome each House's newest residents with videos, food, and fanfare.
Housing Day is an annual College tradition where first-year students receive their assignments to one of the 12 upperclassmen Houses. The bulk of the planning for the annual event occurs during the start of the spring semester with each House filming a Housing Day video, designing t-shirts, and ordering House merchandise for rising sophomores.
This year, the Houses in the Radcliffe Quadrangle—Cabot, Pforzheimer, and Currier—released an additional joint Housing Day video in a lighthearted effort to address the refrain that the Quad is too far, according to Cabot HoCo co-chair Jack W. Deschler ’19.
“One thing that we really love about being in the Quad is that it is a community as a neighborhood, aside from the community within the Houses,” Deschler said.
Deschler said that the three Houses decided to work on the video project together to show students that the Quad is not as far away from the Yard as people believe.
Nicholas C. Colon ’19, a Lowell House Committee co-chair, said that one of Lowell’s goals for this Housing Day is to impart their House traditions to the incoming group of students because Lowell is currently undergoing renovations. Until 2019, Lowell residents will live in several buildings scattered throughout Harvard Square in a set-up known as “swing housing.”
Colon said that Lowell intends to play recordings of their traditional Russian Orthodox bells at the end of the day in lieu of ringing the real ones.
“It’s introducing these traditions to freshmen who won’t be able to see them next year. Hoping that once we’re back into Lowell, they’ll really be able to grab onto them and really make sure that they’re at the forefront of Lowell House and Lowell House Community,” Colon said.
Residents of Winthrop House moved into their newly renovated complex in fall 2017. Trevor D. Noon ’19, Winthrop HoCo co-chair, wrote in an email that preparations for Housing Day will be relatively similar this year and the HoCo will hold activities in traditional spaces, like the Junior Common Room.
“We’re back in the House rather than being in swing. It’s nothing particularly different, just trying to get everyone excited about the new House and returning to older traditions in the JCR," he wrote.
After upperclassmen crowd the Yard and deliver housing assignments to eager freshmen, there will be afternoon and evening activities to welcome rising sophomores into the Houses. Colon said Lowell House will host their Thursday Tea, followed by community dinner, the same day to build House pride.
Deschler said that Cabot will introduce freshmen to the House’s “Big Fish, Little Fish” program where each blocking group is assigned a mentor the night of Housing Day—a reference to their House’s mascot. Deschler added that first-years assigned to Cabot will also receive free drinks at Cabot Cafe on Housing Day.

Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg and pediatrician and philanthropist Priscilla Chan ’07, are giving $30 million for an early education literacy program jointly run by Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, MIT’s Integrated Learning Initiative, and Florida State University, the GSE announced Tuesday.
The initiative, called Reach Every Reader, will work to develop diagnostic screening and personalized education interventions for kindergarteners susceptible to reading difficulties, according to a press release.
“We are excited to support the launch of Reach Every Reader, a unique combination of cutting edge education and neuroscience research to better understand how we can help every kid stay on track to reading on grade level by the end of third grade,” Chan said in a statement to the Boston Globe.
The initiative will begin by partnering researchers from Harvard, MIT, and FSU with a public school district in Charlotte, N.C.
“The biggest thing we’re trying to do… is set all kids up for success in learning and life by being able to read,” said Elizabeth A. City, director of Reach Every Reader. “We’re trying to help the field of education learn how to solve complex, persistent problems.”
According to the GSE’s website, a student who cannot read adequately in first grade has a 90 percent chance of also reading poorly in fourth grade and a 75 percent chance in high school.
“This new collaboration between MITili and HGSE synergizes MIT’s strengths in science and engineering with HGSE’s expertise in the education of children,” wrote John D. E. Gabrieli, the director of MIT’s Integrated Learning Initiative, in a press release.
“We need all this knowledge to improve education, especially for children most vulnerable to falling behind,” he added.
Zuckerberg and Chan founded the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative in 2015. The organization previously donated to Harvard to provide financial aid for low-income students hoping to pursue careers in public service.
Last year, Zuckerberg and Chan opened “The Primary School” a private, K-12 school for low-income students in East Palo Alto, Calif., and in 2010, Zuckerberg donated $100 million to Newark, N.J. public schools.
Reach Every Reader is currently hiring researchers to work on the initiative, according to its website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 8, 2018 at 6:08 a.m.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences debated a proposal that would switch undergraduate courses to a pre-registration system—and eliminate the College’s “shopping week”—at a monthly Faculty meeting Tuesday.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana kicked off the conversation by presenting to the Faculty about early registration. He said Tuesday that, in previous conversations with faculty members, many raised concerns about the current system.
As it works now, College students register for classes after “shopping week,” a week-long period at the beginning of the semester during which students can walk in and out of classes before officially enrolling.
There is no official pre-registration proposal yet on the table. But Khurana said he is interested in further studying the matter.
Many professors spoke in favor of a change to pre-registration, saying the current system makes it difficult for them to plan ahead for their courses.
History professor James T. Kloppenberg said he had prior experience with pre-registration at four different universities and that the early registration allowed him “to be plan-ful and to think carefully about my courses.”
Kloppenberg also said he thinks shopping week poses many logistical issues for teaching staff. He particuarly cited his own course, History 1330: “Social Thought in Modern America,” which he said has seen post-shopping week enrollment numbers that range from 10 to 85 students in recent years.
“It’s very hard to know in advance what kind of materials you want to have, or what classroom you want to be meeting in, without knowing how many students will be in the course,” Kloppenberg said. “I think this has been extremely difficult for our graduate students, who cannot be sure what courses they will be teaching. If they’re not prepared to teach a course and find themselves slotted into it at the last minute, that cannot be optimal for our teaching.”
History professor Andrew D. Gordon ’74 said that, though he supports a move to pre-registration “completely,” he also recognizes that—as an undergraduate—he found the ability to shop classes both “wonderful and necessary.”
A new pre-registration system, however, would not necessarily mean students are locked into the courses they attend on the first day.
“It will be up to the Faculty to make sure all the necessary information about our courses is available on our course websites, and students should understand that there will still be a way to add and drop courses even with pre-registration,” Kloppenberg wrote in an email after the meeting.
This is not the first time the Faculty has brought up changing Harvard’s system for course registration. Between 2010 and 2015, the Faculty used “pre-term planning,” a tool for students to submit tentative schedules before the semester started. After feedback from Faculty that the data gathered was often inaccurate, the College decided to eliminate the system.
Several professors at the meeting said shopping week not only negatively affects their schedules and planning for the semester as well as the schedules of teaching fellows, but that it also negatively affects departmental staff.
Some, though, defended the current system. Computer Science professor Stuart M. Shieber '81 said shopping week does not have to mean teachers and students do not tackle serious course material in the first week.
At the meeting, Khurana also mentioned that the search committee for the next dean of Undergraduate Education has had over 12 outreach meetings with standing committees and is now gathering input for a shortlist of candidates. Current Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris announced in December he would step down in June.
The Faculty also heard from Professor Daniel P. Schrag about his proposal to create an Environmental Science and Engineering concentration in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Previously, the Faculty Council voted unanimously to support the proposal at its Feb. 14 meeting.
Schrag’s proposal will come before the full Faculty for a vote at its next meeting on April 3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Stanford University Education professor Susanna Loeb spoke about the impact of quality teaching on student attendance at the Graduate School of Education Tuesday.
Loeb’s lecture focused on her research studying seventh to eleventh grade student attendance in an urban school district in California. She noted that many previous studies have examined the effect of teacher quality on test scores, but few have examined the effect of teacher quality on attendance.
“We are thinking as a country about all sorts of things that we care about for students, yet we tend to focus on test performance,” Loeb said.
She noted that, in most circumstances, test scores do not predict student drop-out, but attendance does. Loeb said she found a correlation between greater student attendance and higher individual teacher quality based on evaluations within the school district.
According to Loeb, a student on average had 44 percent fewer unexcused absences in math class if he or she had a teacher measured to be within one standard deviation above the average teacher quality rating. The average student would have 54 percent fewer unexcused absences for English class with a higher quality teacher.
The lecture was part of a series hosted by the Partnering in Education Research program at the GSE Center for Education Policy Research. The PIER Fellowship program is designed to train doctoral students on how to partner with school districts for the purpose of education research.
“This public seminar series is part of [the fellowship] training. We bring leading researchers from across the country doing really interesting educational policy quantitative research to present to doctoral students,” said Irene A. Pak, the manager of the PIER program.
Loeb’s lecture was cosponsored by the Harvard Kennedy School Inequality and Social Policy Program.
Thomas Kelley-Kemple, a PIER Fellow and second year doctoral student in the education policy program at the GSE, said that he thought Loeb’s lecture brought a new dimension to the discussion of teacher efficacy.
“There’s been extensive work about how teachers affect test scores, but as [Loeb] pointed out, there’s been substantially less on how teachers affect student behaviors, specifically attendance, [especially] in high school,” Kelley-Kemple said. “So I think this is adding something really valuable to how we think about what teachers do and how they affect students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University representatives released a letter amending Harvard’s Allston development proposal earlier this month in response to concerns filed recently by local residents and organizations.
Harvard first proposed developing its land in Allston into an ‘enterprise research’ campus to promote entrepreneurship in 2011. In April 2016, the University hired real estate agent Steven D. Fessler to manage construction of the area as the “head of enterprise real estate.”
In Dec. 2017, Harvard officially filed its framework and filed development area master plans for the entire campus with the Boston Planning and Development Agency, the city’s urban planning body. Local residents were able to submit responses to the BPDA during its official comment period, which ended in early February.
Various local residents and organizations filed comments to the BPDA, raising concerns about housing, infrastructure, transportation, and open space.
The Impact Advisory Group, a team responsible for advising the development project which meets semi-regularly to discuss Harvard’s plans, wrote that it “cannot currently support the project as it is currently proposed.”
The IAG specifically called upon Harvard to offer a more diverse range of housing options. It recommended the University plan for one-third of its residential options to be market-rate, one-third to be middle income, and one-third to be a mix of affordable housing units and housing for families and the elderly.
In its response letter, the University said current plans for residential spaces are subject to change and will evolve as Harvard works with future development partners.
Currently, the University has committed “upwards of 1,000” units of housing. The letter also noted that 13 percent of the enterprise research construction projects would be classified as affordable according to the city’s housing affordability policy.
Harvard wrote that it believed its residential housing plans will establish “a new, vibrant area where the presence of a diversity of active uses and participants leads to a thriving community of workers, residents, business owners, and neighbors.”
The IAG also recommended Harvard create an additional two acres of “compelling” open spaces early on in the construction process, calling for more park-like spaces. The group outlined its hopes for Harvard to tailor its plans to deemphasize vehicular traffic and better support walking, bike, and public transit infrastructure.
In response to requests for more open and integrated spaces, Harvard proposed adding two addition acres of open space and increasing bike and pedestrian paths in its Allston plans.
“The amount of open space in the Framework Plan has been increased by approximately two acres and includes an additional continuous east-west connection to the east towards the Charles River,” the document reads.
The University noted that it had reached an agreement with Houghton Chemical to remove the company’s rail lines, which will also help add open space.
University spokesperson Kevin Casey wrote in an emailed statement Tuesday that he believes the public comment period has been a positive process.
“The University’s responses reflect comments received over seven IAG meetings since November. We feel this has been an exceptionally productive process—resulting in tangible modifications of the plan,” he wrote.
“We look forward to discussing our letter and any remaining issues on Wednesday night," he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard’s women’s basketball team braved weather delays in New York to finish its regular season with two victories over Cornell and Columbia. The Crimson extended its winning streak to four games heading into the Ivy League Tournament, concluding its regular season with a season sweep of both opponents.
Harvard’s offense exploded in both games, paired with a defense that has enjoyed two straight weekends of strong play. The Crimson (18-9, 10-4 Ivy) completely dominated in its 91-57 victory over the Big Red (7-20, 3-11) and cruised to victory 78-59 the next day against the Lions (8-21, 2-12).
“I am proud that we took care of business in both games,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said.
Ending the season on a high note, Harvard has secured the number three seed in the conference tournament, and will face off against Penn in what will be a virtual home game for their opponent at the Palestra.
SHARING THE ROCK
In the weekend matches, the Crimson displayed one of its top qualities: a plethora of offensive weapons. There were nine double-digit performances by Harvard players across the two day span, including two from sophomore guard Katie Benzan, senior guard Taylor Rooks, and junior co-captain Madeline Raster.
“We want to share the ball and balance out our attack,” Delaney-Smith said.
Freshman forward Jadyn Bush stepped up for a big day against the Lions, scoring a career-high 21 points.
“Jadyn Bush had her best game this year,” Delaney-Smith said. “She was immense on both sides, on the defensive end and offensive end.”
Other Crimson players also rose to the occasion, with junior guard Nani Redford recording a career-high 12 points against the Big Red and sophomore forward Jeannie Boehm notching her fourth double-double of the year against Cornell with 15 points and 10 rebounds.
Harvard recorded 38 assists on the weekend as a whole, distributing the ball proficiently among its many scorers.
“Sharing the ball makes playing so much more fun,” Benzan said. “And having so many threats inside and outside is just too hard to defend.”
DOMINANCE IN THE PAINT
Throughout the entire trip in New York, the Crimson completely controlled the inside game. Harvard outrebounded its conference rivals 86-60 over the course of the weekend.
“Rebounding is going to be very key next weekend because Penn and Princeton have two really good girls [down low],” Benzan said.
In addition, the Crimson offense flowed through its bigs. Harvard outscored Cornell and Columbia 48-28 and 40-29 in the paint, respectively. The Crimson was led by Boehm and Bush, who each had a turn in pushing forward the Harvard offense.
“I thought they really struggled defending our inside game,” Delaney-Smith said.
As Benzan noted, the Crimson continuing its dominance in the paint would serve it well transitioning into the conference tournament and playing against some of the conference’s toughest teams down low.
SNOWED IN
Following inclement weather, the original slate of Friday and Saturday was pushed back to Saturday and Sunday, meaning the Empire State games were the final contests for the Ancient Eight regular season across the conference.
“It was a bit of a tough one because they’re two hard, rough trips on the bus,” Benzan said. “We got snowed in at Ithaca.”
The New York trip is traditionally difficult for Harvard due to the distance, and adding an extra day on the road in which the Crimson was not allowed to practice only complicated the journey for Harvard.
Despite the weather, the Crimson showed no signs of letting the unconventional road trip slow it down. The Harvard offense obviously showed its offensive prowess, averaging 84.5 points over the weekend.
The Crimson defense continued its impressive stretch. In its current four-game winning streak, Harvard has not allowed more than 60 points in a single game. Strong defense paired with its explosive offense will prove important heading into postseason play in Philadelphia against the top teams of the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team made the trip out to Las Cruces, N.M., for a four-game series with New Mexico State this weekend. Despite a blowout loss to the Aggies (8-4) on Sunday, the Crimson (2-6) was able to split a doubleheader on Saturday, losing on a walk-off in the first game before a three-run ninth inning lifted the visitors to victory in the nightcap.
Junior centerfielder Ben Skinner and sophomore shortstop Chad Minato led the way for the Harvard offense, combining for 10 hits and 11 runs batted in while junior right-hander Kevin Stone picked up the team’s lone victory on the mound.“I thought we showed a lot of fight this weekend,” Skinner said. “I think we definitely showed that we’re a team that’s going to have the ability to win ball games late and come back and rally, which is something that we haven’t really had my first two years so we’re definitely looking forward for that.”
NEW MEXICO STATE 23, HARVARD 4 (SEVEN INNINGS)
New Mexico State ended the weekend with a bang, tagging five Crimson pitchers for 23 runs on 17 hits in a shortened contest. The Aggies exploded for 13 runs in the bottom of the sixth innings and hit five home runs. Sophomore shortstop Joey Ortiz and junior right fielder Logan Ehnes each went deep and drove in five runs.
“I think we were a little bit tired today, it’s been a bit of a long weekend, but again we’ll be experiencing that down the road in the Ivy League so it’s not a great excuse, something that we’ll have to improve on,” Skinner said. “Things got a little bit out of hand, but we’re certainly not hitting the panic button over here or anything. Flush that one, forget about it, and move on.”
Freshman Chris McGrory and sophomore JT Bernard did not retire any of the 11 batters that they faced, allowing six earned runs in the process. The 23 runs allowed are the most during Harvard head coach Bill Decker’s five years at the helm. Sophomores Hunter Bigge and Jake Suddleson were bright spots for the Crimson on Sunday as the pair accounted for the ball club’s only two home runs of the weekend.
HARVARD 5, NEW MEXICO STATE 4
Despite being competitive for most of the weekend’s first two contests, Harvard did not pick up its first victory of the trip until Saturday evening. Stone was a workhorse and picked up the win, throwing 115 pitches over eight innings. Despite walking five batters and conceding three runs in the fifth inning, the Stamford, Conn., native was a steady hand for the Crimson, especially late in the game. Stone surrendered just one hit in his final three innings of work and was in line for the win after Harvard posted a three-run ninth inning.
“It’s great to gain that experience early on,” Skinner said. “Obviously when games come down to the wire in the Ivy League, which they do a lot, it’s nice to be able to look back and say that we’ve been in that position before. It was a lot of fun to come out on top in that second game and I think that we’ll hopefully carry that momentum into spring break.”
Harvard regained the lead in that frame after Minato and Skinner both singled to drive home a trio of Crimson baserunners. New Mexico State made it interesting in the bottom half of the frame but Bigge struck out redshirt junior third baseman Caleb Henderson to strand two baserunners.
NEW MEXICO STATE 11, HARVARD 9 (10 INNINGS)
Redshirt senior Mason Fishback hit a walk-off two-run home run as the Aggies took the front end of Saturday’s doubleheader. Fishback knocked senior right-hander Garrett Rupp’s 2-0 offering over the fence to cap off a game that Harvard led entering the bottom half of the ninth inning. After the Crimson attained a 7-5 advantage after its sixth at-bat, the hosts jumped back on top with one run in the sixth and two more an inning later. Skinner singled home senior Austin Black and Bigge but a single with one out in the bottom of the ninth by New Mexico State senior David Bellamy sent the game into extras. Skinner and Minato each drove in three runs for Harvard.
“I think we just hung in there,” Minato said. “We had some tough innings, but in both of those games, we were able to bounce back pretty late in the game and find our swings, find our rhythm against their pitchers. That was pretty good for us. I think we could be a little more consistent early on and especially in the middle of games, but on the back end, we’re definitely good in that aspect.”
NEW MEXICO STATE 11, HARVARD 5
A six-run bottom of the eighth inning propelled the Aggies to the victory on Friday afternoon. After jumping out to a 5-0 lead off of Harvard starter Noah Zavolas, New Mexico State allowed the Crimson to tie the game after hanging a four-spot in the first half of the eighth. However, a Trey Stine grand slam capped off the decisive inning for the hosts as Harvard freshman Buddy Hayward was tagged with the loss after conceding the six runs.
“I think it’d be nice to see everybody kind of relax,” Minato said. “I think having two weekends under our belt, that will help guys kind of relax and just pitch, not be so tense and try to force strikes but just try to [pitch to] contact.”
Stine and Fishback combined to drive in eight of the Aggies’ 11 runs. Hayward had three hits for the Crimson as the team’s designated hitter but his teammates were only able to muster five hits outside of its big eighth inning.

A well-located house with a social vibe, Quincy is an all around solid place to be. Featuring large rooms and even some singles for sophomores, as well as its signature Quincy Grille and Qube library, there are a lot of collaborative spaces to chill, study, and catch up with friends. Whether you’re in the Square, in class, or walking along the river, Quincy will always seem just close enough.

When it comes to housing in Quincy, sophomores are in luck. Rooms tend to be large doubles overall. As a sophomore, though, you will likely live in Old Quincy, which has the smallest rooms in Quincy. As an upperclassman, you will be able to room in DeWolfe, which suits an adult apartment lifestyle, or New Quincy, which features single rooms and spacious common rooms ideal for throwing parties.

If you don’t have a common room or a DeWolfe kitchen, there are still spaces to study, or grab a study break, with friends. Quincy Grille is renowned for its BoardPlus-able Mozz sticks (with a dab of ranch), perfect for soaking up “fluids” after a night out. For nights in, the Qube library and Quincy dhall are productive places to study. There’s a lot of great open events too. For example, the Super Bowl Watch party always brings out a large crowd. Karaoke-style stein is also well-attended.
Interestingly, Quincy has never won an IM sport, ever. However, the Faculty Deans, Lee and Deborah J. Gehrke, are bent on winning this year, and Quincy is currently number one in the Straus Cup standings…stay tuned, because this House could be making history.

For a closer look at what makes Quincy so special, we sat down with HoCo co-chair Harrison J. Tanzola ’19:
What should freshmen who get your House look forward to?
HT: Getting involved in IMs, hanging out at the Grille, and getting nice singles. Huge singles!
What is the biggest misconception about your House?
HT: I thought that since it was a big House, it wouldn’t have such a tight-knit community, but you’ll get out of it what you put into it. If you want to get involved in the community, you’ll make a ton of friends.
What Hogwarts house would your House get sorted in to?
HT: Gryffindor, for sure.

Lowell is synonymous with community (and not in the incestuous way) so rising sophomores can expect to jump into immediately into vibrant House life including regular tea times and in-house speeches. Lowell can also considered to be the best of both worlds in the lottery, as new Lowellians will get to enjoy swing housing for a year before becoming the first residents of a renovated Lowell proper.


Because Lowell House will still be under renovation for the next school year, most sophomores can expect to live in the Lowtell next year. Most of these rooms will be relatively spacious doubles with in-suite bathrooms and air conditioning (!). Sophomores are generally sorted to the Inn, at 1201 Mass. Ave, to keep them close together and foster a stronger sense of community in their first year in Lowell.
Given the bloat of the Class of 2021 though, it’s likely that there will be a number of lucky sophomores who get to live in other swing housing, which includes Prescott, Ridgely, Fairfax, and more. These are mostly suites which house around four people and provide residents with massive common rooms, so keep your fingers crossed. Although this year none of these rooms were used as party spaces, there’s no doubt that the potential is there, with the right residents.
Though details about the renovation are sparse, the updated Lowell House will have a space dedicated to screening/watching films in addition to all-around upgraded amenities.
Community is Lowell’s main quality (enough to be considered a quirk!) and this tradition has persisted despite the move to swing housing during the House’s renovation. As mentioned, the Lowtell is purposely filled with sophomores in order to to build a sense of tightness and community the moment students enter the House.
This strong sense of House spirit is carried even by alumni. HoCo co-chair Sal R. DeFrancesco ’19 notes many Lowellians who return to Harvard as graduate students or professors “immediately try to affiliate with the Senior Common Room.”
Co-chair Nick C. Colon ’19 says most of HoCo’s budget “goes towards building Lowell House community,” ranging from steins within the house to outings in Boston. Colon also notes that the transition to swing housing has not stopped Lowell’s traditional weekly teas, describing it as “the time where all of Lowell House gets together” and “one of the hallmarks of most Lowellians’ time in Lowell.” DeFrancesco says simply, “I love Thursday tea.”
Beyond these social events, Lowell House also has Lowell Speeches every year, a series of speeches in the spring semester that allow Lowellians to deliver performances on any topic to the rest of their Housemates.
We got even more information about Lowell House from the HoCo chairs:
Tell us something quirky about Lowell.
NC: Bacchanalia, which is our spring formal. So historically when we were in Lowell proper, we had a tent in the courtyard for the first half of the event, and then we’d go into the dining hall for the second half for more of a party type vibe. But, in between those two things we have a Bacchus ceremony where around [11 p.m.] or midnight depending on the year...we’d go up to our belltower where we have our set of Russian bells, and we ring the bell twelve times and then a Bacchus comes out; he’s dressed in a toga, carrying a bottle of wine. There’s this whole script and whole kind of performance of Bacchus coming out and causing revelry.
SD: That’s how we usher everyone from the outside tent into the inside dining hall for the second half of the event. So yeah, that was a lot of fun last year.
If you could pitch Lowell House to freshman, how would you advocate for it?
SD: I would say even if you’re scared about swing, even if you’re concerned that you’re gonna come in here and your blocking group’s very small, you don’t know anyone you got into the House with, everyone in Lowell House gets to know almost everyone else in Lowell House. Really, there’s events for everyone and if you show up to one of them, you’re gonna meet someone that you never [would have] met otherwise.
NC: I would definitely want the incoming sophomores to know that there will always be a support system for them, whether that be in HoCo, whether that be their blocking group, or whether that be the House administration, there’s always going to be someone who will try to make sure that their Lowell House experience is going to be the best that it could possibly be.
Could you describe Lowell House in one phrase?
SD: Nope.
NC: Aside from just being extremely supportive, I really think it’s hard to encompass all that Lowell House is in one phrase.
SD: Should be we be quirky and use occasionem cognosce?
NC: Yes.
SD: Okay, so Lowell House’s motto is occasionem cognosce. That means “know the occasion.” So I would say that’s the motto for a reason. Whether you’re [on] the House Committee, whether you’re staff, whether you’re [a] student; we really try to get a read on the occasion, figure out what’s best, and because of that we put on some of the best events.

Adams—close to the Yard, and home to presidents and gold-painted walls. There’s a reason why people in Adams are a little bit happier about their House than the rest of campus. They seem a bit prouder, stand a bit taller, and brag a bit harder. Freshmen, if you get Adams, there can be no doubt you’ve won the Housing Lottery.


Adams “feels very fancy,” according to Adams House Committee co-chair Brady Stevens ’19. From walls painted in real gold to beautiful hallways and staircases, Adams House has style galore. Plus, with 70-year-old wrought-iron door knobs, Batman-style elevators, and a system of underground tunnels decorated by previous inhabitants, Adams has a sense of history that is unmatched by any other House.
Adams’s location is also prime. A River House, yet also a block or two away from Harvard Yard, Adams offers a sense of distance from class, but a quick walk so you can roll out of bed at 9:02 a.m. for your 9:00 a.m. class.
Housing for undergraduates is divided into four buildings: Claverly Hall, Randolph Hall, Russell Hall, and Westmorley Court. An additional building named Apthorp House serves as the residence for Faculty Deans John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and Judith S. Palfrey ’67. Most incoming sophomores are placed into doubles or triples in Claverly or Randolph Hall. With large common rooms, high ceilings, and lots of light, these are some of the best rooms a sophomore at Harvard can hope for. Indeed, though she was in Westmorley her sophomore year, Adams HoCo co-chair Bailey Colfax ’19 had “a balcony [overlooking] Bow Street.”  Note that, unlike the other Adams buildings, Claverly is not connected by the tunnel system.
In June 2019, when the Class of 2021 will be rising juniors, Adams is scheduled to undergo a complete renovation. While not everyone will need swing housing during the renovation due to the fact that Adams has several buildings, it’s inevitable that some people will be moved.
“I trust that Adams…will still hang together and keep it together. I’d rather be an Adams student in swing housing than anywhere else,” he said.  “As long as there’s Carpe,” everything will be okay, he added.
Adams’s Faculty Deans are also asking for feedback on how to renovate Adams, but maintain its historical feel and significance. According to Stevens, the students are helping to decide “how to keep Adams, Adams.”
Perhaps the most famous event that is unique to Adams is Carpe Noctem.  Unlike many Houses, Adams has its Stein weekly. Called Carpe Noctem (“seize the night” in Latin) or just Carpe for short, it consists of Adams residents getting together over pizza and Mike’s Hards, oftentimes with some music playing in the background. Stevens notes that “a lot of the time Faculty Deans will be there and you get to say hi to them. It’s great to get everybody together in one place.”
As for once-a-year events, Chocoholica is Adams’s yearly Valentine’s Day-themed blowout. In Colfax’s words, it’s “wild.” Apparently, Adams is known for being really extra, and Chocoholica doesn’t disappoint. From chocolates and roses to more chocolates and roses to...even more chocolates and roses, Stevens reports that chocolates and roses are “a large percentage of [HoCo’s] budget.” Unsurprising.
Besides chocolates and roses though, there are chocolate fountains, chocolate truffles, chocolates cakes, hot chocolate, and what we can only assume to be an immeasurable amount of chocolate solely for Colfax, whose smile turned into a creepy grin as she whispered, “everything chocolate.” Who wouldn’t want a HoCo this passionate, folks?
As for general House spirit, Adams is known for being quirky. Before housing selection was randomized, Adams was known for being the artsy, alternative House. Much of that vibe still lives on today and shows itself in events like Drag Night, and in the drawings scribbled in the Adams tunnels. Despite being a relatively large House, it manages to have a small House feel, with the community being very “close-knit,” according to Colfax.
We talked to the HoCo chairs to get the inside scoop on what Adams is really like:
What should freshmen know about Adams?
BS: Adams is the best House to get. Great housing. Warm, welcoming community. Pizza every Thursday.
BC: Look forward to a cigar and a rose and signing the Adams House book.
What are three words to describe Adams House?
BC and BS: Grand, unique, family.
What Hogwarts House is Adams?
BC and BS: Gryffindor. Between the colors and the pride, it’s obvious.
Which superheroes are your Faculty Deans?
BC and BS: Both are Professor X.
