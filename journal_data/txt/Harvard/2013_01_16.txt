Vans, motorbikes, and unusually large rats sped through the four-lane highway in Halong Bay. My mom paused at the sidewalk and looked both ways, then began to cross almost immediately. I guess the show of caution was just a formality.
At first I thought it was some sort of test to see if my ears had been working for the first 12 years of my life. If they had, I would know the usual mantras: Always cross the street at the crosswalk. Don’t walk straight into traffic. The Little Mermaid is fiction.
But my mom didn’t turn around and congratulate me with a gold star for my street crossing vigilance. She kept going. She walked steadily into the traffic, apparently oblivious to the honking horns and careening two-ton vehicles.
So this is how my mom is going to die. Hit by a car in Vietnam.
I looked at her destination, a two-star hotel across the street. Its rundown suites and functioning toilets hardly seemed worth the loss of a parent—although there was free Wi-Fi.
I wonder if my new mom will be a good cook.
I looked at the rest of my family to see if they had any idea what was going on, or who my new mother would be. While my brother seemed to favor someone who could make a meatloaf, on the whole everyone just looked confused.
“What is she doing?” my dad asked.
What she was not doing (to everyone’s surprise) was getting hit by a vehicle. Each step brought her closer to successfully crossing the street without a single injury or vermin transmitted disease.
At first I thought my mom was secretly some sort of gamer and was taking this opportunity to demonstrate her uncanny prowess at Frogger, but then I realized that she wasn’t doing anything at all. This was reverse Frogger. Reggorf: the less challenging and possibly made-up Vietnamese version of the classic arcade game where the cars and bikes dodge the people.
Not wanting to miss out on a building with actual plumbing or to be left alone in this alternate universe where everything I learned as a child was backwards, I decided to follow my mother across the road. Levin family. Reggorf champions in the making.
I looked left and then right, then left again, just in case I also had directions wrong. When there was a lull in traffic, I bolted. Still fearing for my life with what measure of self preservation I had, I spastically dodged nonexistent cars and imagined traffic. I made it to the other side of the road like a badly delivered chicken joke.
“What were you thinking mom?” I panted, mopping the sweat off my brow and looking upwards in case I had missed any falling pianos or blimps.
“That’s how they cross the road in Vietnam,” she replied. “I read it in the travel guide.”
Now she tells me. I should really start reading those books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over a career spanning nearly half a century, psychology professor J. Richard Hackman garnered widespread esteem and accolades for pioneering the study of team dynamics. But on the side, Hackman quietly devoted countless hours to improving one team in particular—the Harvard women's basketball squad, for which he volunteered as an honorary coach.
Those who knew him say that gestures like these defined Hackman, who died on Jan. 8 in Boston following complications from lung cancer. He was 72.
“He really lived what he was studying," said Alexa S. Fishman ‘13, Hackman's thesis advisee. "He wanted to help and give back to the undergraduate community."
By all accounts, Hackman was a model team player who practiced what he taught. He was at once a dry wit who knew how to lighten the mood with humor, an attentive mentor and colleague skilled at putting others at ease, and a maverick unafraid to voice dissent when the situation demanded it.
According to psychology professor Daniel T. Gilbert, Hackman’s brand of humor “wasn’t standard comedy.”
“He was funny, quirky, interesting,” Gilbert said. “He was not a guy who sat down and told canned jokes.”
In a thesis prospective meeting with Hackman, Fishman recalled, Hackman deadpanned that her thesis proposal was not up to par. After she offered to take back her proposal, Hackman quickly reassured her that he was not being serious.
“He said, ‘No, no, I’m joking, it’s totally fine,’” Fishman recalled. “He wanted to add a little humor to this meeting that sort of had to happen.”
Hackman, who stood at a commanding six-foot-six-and-a-half stature, was known for taking every opportunity to relax.
“It didn’t matter if he was sitting with the president of the University—when he got comfortable and sat down, he just took off his shoes,” Gilbert said. “If it was possible for him to lay down, he would also do that.”
Those who knew him remembered Hackman for his natural generosity and attentiveness to others.
“Everyone got his attention,” Fishman said. “When he spoke to you and he was talking to you, he was 100 percent focused on you.”
Christopher M. Dial, Hackman’s assistant, said that in their conversations, Hackman was always concerned about how Dial and others were doing.
“He and I would just chat about things that were just everyday,” Dial said. “I’ll miss someone who just checks in and wants to know how you’re doing.”
Colleagues say this caring spirit was matched by an expansive intellect, one that contributed immensely to the field of organizational psychology.
“You could bring him a problem at any level of psychology, and he could help you think it through,” Gilbert said.
Hackman, who came to Harvard in 1986 after 20 years at Yale, conducted research on team dynamics that had substantial real-world implications, including new research methodology within the intelligence community for studying teams and an alternative method for training cockpit crews.
Hackman received numerous awards for his work, among them the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award within the American Psychological Association’s division on industrial and organizational psychology.
But despite the accolades, Hackman maintained a steadfast humility that translated into a distaste for boasting throughout his years of teaching.
“He looked askance at people who spent a lot of time tooting their own horn,” Gilbert said. “Richard had a silencer on his horn, so even when he did remarkable things, he would work to make sure nobody found out about them.”
Even after they had been friends for nearly 20 years, Gilbert said, he only learned about Hackman’s work for the women’s basketball team after he spotted Hackman at one of the games.
But coupled with this humility was what Hackman’s wife Judith D. Hackman described as her husband’s distinctly “contrarian” streak.
“He was often the one who voted no, and everybody else voted yes,” she said. “His 'no' was probably the right thing to say.”
Gilbert agreed, calling his friend “a moral beacon” who was “unendingly concerned with what was right and what was wrong.”
Yet those who were close to Hackman said it is the little things that are most irreplaceable about him.
For Judith Hackman, it will be her husband’s daily phone calls; for Gilbert, it will be Hackman’s penchant for barbecue.
“In the last two decades he and I probably hit every good barbecue stand within a 50-mile radius of Boston,” Gilbert said. “I will forever more be eating brisket and ribs by myself.”
Aside from his wife Judith, Hackman is survived by two daughters, Julia B. Proffitt and Laura D. Codeanne; two sons-in-law, W. Trexler Proffitt and Matthew J. Codeanne; and four grandchildren, George R., Lauren E., and Edward M. Proffitt, and Mattox J. Codeanne.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 16, 2012, at 8:54 p.m.
French actress Marion Cotillard has been named the recipient of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals 2013 Woman of the Year award.
Cotillard received critical acclaim for starring as Édith Piaf in “La Vie en Rose,” a role that earned her an Academy Award for best actress and made her the first person to win an Oscar for a French language performance in 2007. She also garnered rave reviews for her 2010 performance as Mallorie Cobb in “Inception” alongside Leonardo DiCaprio.
Renee E. Rober ’13, president of the Pudding, lauded Cotillard's qualifications after the selection was announced on Wednesday.
“We all have a French exam that we're a little nervous about, so we thought we'd pick somebody who can tutor us,” Rober joked. “But in all seriousness, she is wildly talented—she can sing, act, dance, speak both English and French.… Nobody is more excited about that than I am.”
Tyler B. Faux ’13, the Pudding's publicity manager, also expressed enthusiasm for the pick in an emailed statement.
“As an internationally accomplished actress and singer with a brilliant career heralded by critics and mainstream audiences alike, Marion Cotillard has entranced the Pudding with her multitude of talents and an unbridled commitment to her art,” Faux wrote.
In the annual Woman of the Year celebration to be held on Jan. 31, Cotillard will be honored with a parade through Cambridge, after which she will be roasted by the Pudding and presented with a traditional Pudding Pot. Tickets for the event can be purchased on the Pudding's website.
With Wednesday's announcement, Cotillard joins the elite company of past honorees—including Claire Danes, Anne Hathaway, Charlize Theron, Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster, and Jane Fonda—who have won the award since it was established in 1951.
The Pudding’s 2013 Man of the Year award will be announced next week, to be followed by an event honoring the male awardee on Feb. 8.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. First up, the Brown Bears.
Football:
Although finishing third in the league in 2012, the Brown football team enjoyed an eerily similar season to 2011, where they finished second. In both years, the team notched seven victories while outscoring opponents by almost exactly 50 points (50 in ’11, 51 in ’12). Led by quarterback Patrick Donnelly’s 226 yards per game and 15 touchdowns, the Bears won four of five after starting the season with conference losses against Harvard and Princeton. The lone exception was a 20-17 road loss to Penn where Brown took a 17-14 lead on a Cody Taulbee 1-yard touchdown plunge with three minutes to go, only to see Penn twice drive down the field for game-tying and game-winning field goals. Donnelly will graduate this year as the Bears look to take a three-game season ending winning streak as momentum into 2013.
Men’s Water Polo:
 The 14th-ranked Brown water polo team finished second and fifth in its two most important tournaments of the year, losing to St. Francis in the finals of the CWPA Northern Championships and defeating No. 17 Navy to take fifth in the CWPA Eastern Championships. Senior Svetozar Stefanovic was named CWPA Northern Division Player of the year for the fourth consecutive season and joined teammates James McNamara and Henry Fox on the CWPA First Team All-North. The team won 29 of its 33 matches, beginning the season with seven straight victories to win the Brown Labor Day Weekend Tournament, one of two tournament victories (along with the Ivy League Championships) it took home on the year.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 For the fourth consecutive year, Brown could not escape the basement of the Ancient Eight. The Bears have alternated between seventh and eighth during that time, finishing a game ahead of their 2011-2012 squad this year. After winning two of three to start the season at the Central Connecticut and CCSU Invitationals, the Bears stumbled in losing five of their next six, capturing only three of a possible eighteen total sets over that time frame. Freshman Maddie Lord provided a bright spot for the squad, finishing eighth in the conference in kills.
 
Men’s Golf: 
 After a last place finish at the Ivy League Golf championships last fall, the Brown golf team was honored in the offseason with a GCAA Team Academic Award, posting the second highest cumulative grade point average in Division I. After an early fifth place finish in the Navy Invitational, the team posted three consecutive top-15 finishes before ending the season with a season-best effort in the Ivy League match play tournament. Sophomore Justin Miller won two of three matches on the weekend to help the Bears defeat both Harvard and Princeton en route to a third place finish.
 
Women’s Golf:
The Brown golf team had a busy 2011, competing in nine tournaments and playing 23 rounds of golf—both of which tied for or led the Ancient Eight. The Bears posted an average score of 314.26 strokes per round, edging out Columbia and Penn for second best in the conference. Low scorer sophomore Stephanie Hsieh finished the semester fifth in the conference last year, posting an average score of just 4.7 strokes above par but has improved even as she fell to eighth in the conference. Hsieh cut her strokes per round by nearly one whole stroke but the rest of the team has struggled to replace 2011 top-25 seniors Megan Touhy, Heath Arison, and Carly Arison. Hsieh is the only Bear in the top 25, although freshmen Juliette Garay and Lauren Flynn both rank in the top 35.
 
Women’s Soccer:
After a season in which they outscored their opponents by ten goals and finished with 10 wins and a fourth-place finish in the Ancient Eight, the Brown women’s soccer team regressed in 2012. The Bears won only one game and notched only seven wins against six losses. Brown benefited from strong net play, with goalie Amber Bledsoe leading the league in save percentage and backup MC Barrett finished fifth. Splitting time in the goal, the two gave up a combined 18 goals. On the offensive side of the ball, Chloe Cross led the conference with 69 shots and led the team with five goals.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 After finishing first in the Ivy League a season before, the Brown soccer team finished third in the Ancient Eight in 2012 but ended the season ranked No. 15 in the nation. The team lost only one game in conference play but lost its final game of the season in overtime to Dartmouth in a loss that cost it the Ivy crown. The team defeated Drexel in the first round of the NCAA championship before falling in the second to two seed Maryland. Three members of the team (seniors Sam Kernan-Schloss, Dylan Remick, and Ryan McDuff) were named to Academic All-Ivy squads and Remick was named an All-American by the NCAA and invited to the 2013 MLS Player Combine. Remick led the team with seven assists and tossed in two goals as well.
 
Field Hockey:
A year after the winless 2011 squad finished last in the Ivy League, the Brown field hockey team scored its first conference win since the 2010 team won three straight to end the year. The team won four of its last ten games after a 2-5 start to the season, and sophomore Meghan O’Donnell finished sixth in the conference in goals. O’Donnell had three game-winning goals for the Bears and scored four goals in Brown’s three game winning streak in late October. Fellow sophomores Clayton Christus and Shannon McSweeney, along with O’Donnell and freshman Alexis Miller, were given 2012 All-Ivy honors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the Columbia Lions.
Football:
After finishing last in the Ivy League in 2011, and being outscored by 117 points along the way, before notching its only victory of the season in a double-overtime last week thriller against second-place Brown, the Columbia football team had nowhere to go but up in 2012. Although the team scored fewer points than a season before, an improved defense managed to give up 56 fewer points as well. Take out the 69-0 drubbing by Harvard and Columbia gave up only 22.6 points per game in its other contests. The Lions lost close decisions to Penn and Dartmouth, even leading the eventual champion Quakers by ten points with ten minutes to go before consecutive touchdown drives by Billy Ragone ended their upset bid. The Lions finished with three wins on the season, including a 17-point victory over the Cornell Big Red and pro prospect quarterback Jeff Matthews.
 
Volleyball:
 Along with Yale and Princeton, Columbia continued its excellence in volleyball at the top of the Ancient Eight. The Lions tied with the Tigers for second and have finished no lower than third in the past four years. Although Columbia struggled in early season losses to Yale and Princeton in which it won a combined one set, the team won five in a row to end the season and defeated the Tigers 3-1 in the season finale. Senior outside hitter Megan Gaughn won her third consecutive All-Ivy League honors and second-straight first-team nod, having double digit kills in 17 matches and finishing second in the conference in kills per set.
 
Women’s Golf:
 A year after finishing third in the Ivy League with an average score of 27 strokes over par, the Columbia women’s golf team ranks fourth in the conference at the turn of the new calendar year. Sophomore Michelle Piyapattra, the best golfer in the Ivy League last year with two tournament rounds and an average score of just three strokes over par, has taken a step back in her junior season. Piyapattra, now the 14th ranked golfer in the Ivy League according to Golfstat, has played the most rounds—along with her teammates—of any Ancient Eight player but has seen her score against par rise by nearly two whole strokes. A low round of 65 represents the best effort of the year by an Ivy League player, but Piyapattra has been inconsistent in losing her spot atop the rankings. Six Columbia golfers rank in the top 30, but none in the top 10.
 
Men’s Golf: 
 Like the women, the Columbia men’s golf team has slipped a year after finishing third in the Ivy League. The Lions are currently sixth in the conference but have played more rounds than any other team but Penn. Top-heavy Columbia has two golfers in the top 11 of the Ivy League but nobody else in the top 25. Freshman Harrison Shih has played each tournament for Columbia and his low score of 65 is the best recorded this year by an Ivy League golfer. Junior Jordan Lee has played only two tournaments due to injury, but averages just three strokes above par and is tied for sixth in the league.
 
Women’s Soccer:
A model of consistency, the Columbia women’s soccer team finished fifth in the Ivy League for the third straight year. After winning three of their first six games, the Lions won only three of their next ten. Beverly Leon led the team with six goals and three assists and 33 shots on goals, with a 54.5% shots on goal percentage that led the squad. The team lost only one decision by more than one goal, but finished 2-8 in one-goal matches. In each win, the team shut out its opponent and goalie Grace Redmon finished second in the conference with 74 saves.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 The Columbia men’s soccer team finished the season with two wins in eight Ivy League matches and struggled in overtime games to put away opponents. All four overtime contests the Lions contested ended in ties, making the difference between a 2011 where the team finished third in the Ivy League and a 2012 where three losses by one goal doomed the team during conference play. The month of October, where the team went 1-1-3 and scored only four goals, was particularly rough.
 
Field Hockey:
A year after tying for third, the Columbia field hockey team secured an outright third place Ancient Eight finish in 2012. After losing its first two games, the team caught fire in winning seven of their last nine, with losses against Albany (N.Y.) and Princeton breaking up a series of Lion victories. Sisters Bridget and Katie DeSandis combined for 19 assists, finishing fourth and fifth, respectively, in the Ivy League. Goalie Christie O’Hara finished with 120 goals and a save percentage of .755.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major fall sport. Next up, the Cornell Big Red.
Football:
 Before the season began, Cornell was picked to finish third in the Ivy League and was even given two first-place votes. The season began well, with victories in two of the team’s first three games (including a 39 point drubbing of Yale). However, the week after Cornell lost by 32 in Cambridge and would only win two games the remainder of the season, one a 37-35 thriller over Princeton in which NFL prospect Jeff Mathews threw for 525 yards and four touchdowns against a porous Tigers secondary. Mathews accounted for 3,196 yards through the air and 18 touchdowns, both tops in the conference as receivers Luke Tasker, Gren Gellatly, and Kurt Ondash finished one-two-three in the conference in receiving yards. Cornell’s defense—which gave up 452 yards a game, proved to be the team’s downfall as the team lost three games in which it put up at least 27 points.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
The Cornell volleyball team improved by two victories and one place in the Ancient Eight standings in 2012, winning five of its last ten games to climb to sixth place in the Ivy League. The squad started by dropping three of its first four league decisions but rebounded and won nine of its final 14 sets, including a 3-1 victory over the second-place Princeton Tigers. Cornell had not beaten Princeton in six years. Outside Hitter Kelly Marble starred for the big red, playing the most matches and sets of any player in the conference and leading the conference in service aces and finishing second in kills.
 
Men’s Golf:
After finishing seventh in 2011, the 2012 Cornell golf team has slipped to last in the Ancient Eight standings after its first three tournaments. The team’s scores are virtually identical to those from last year, and after sporting no golfers in the top 25 in the past season, junior Carl Schimenti ranks 19th in the Ivy League in 2012.  
 
Women’s Soccer:
 A difficult campaign for the Cornell women’s soccer team ended without an Ivy League win and only one win in sixteen contests. The team gave up 42 goals in 16 matches but only 14 in seven conference contests. First-year coach Patrick Farmer and the team struggled to close out the season after a promising four game stretch in October where, despite outscoring opponents 5-4, the team managed only a 1-2-1 record. In the final two games of the season, the team gave up eight goals, scoring only one in defeats to Princeton and Dartmouth. Sophomore midfielder Claire MacManus and senior forward Maneesha Chitanvis were named to the All-Ivy League Second team after the season, a bright spot in a winless Ivy campaign.
 
Men’s Soccer:
Just two years after finishing last in the Ivy League, the Cornell men’s soccer team completed the turnaround in finishing 15-2 on the season and 6-1 in the league, capturing its first Ancient Eight title since 1995. Over the past two years, the Big Red flipped a -3 goal differential into a +26 one and made the NCAA Championships before 1-0 to Syracuse in the first round. The Big Red exploded out of the gate with 12 straight wins. After the season, junior Daniel Haber was named a First-Team All-American and signed a professional soccer contract with Israel’s Maccabi Haifa, forgoing his senior year of eligibility and starting an immediate leave of absence.
 
Field Hockey:
After dropping six of its first seven decisions to begin the season, the Cornell field hockey team won six matches in a row in the highlight of a 2012 campaign that saw it finish fourth in the Ancient Eight. Three one-goal losses left the Big Red behind Dartmouth and Columbia. Forward Hannah Balleza ranked third in the Ivy League with 35 points, while goalie Carolyn Horner ranked second in the Ancient Eight with 1.88 goals-against average.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next Up, the Dartmouth Big Green.
Football:
 Picked to finish sixth in the preseason, the Dartmouth football team tied Brown and Princeton for third in the league and outscored its opponents by 41 points per game. The Big Green won six games and lost close decisions to Penn (28-21) and Brown (28-24) that could have taken it higher up in the standings. The Big Green was a perplexing 1-4 at home—the product of taking on the class of the conference (Brown, Harvard and Penn) in Hanover—but an unblemished 5-0 on the road. For the season, running back Dominick Pierre was the team’s best offensive player, posting nine touchdowns and 92 rushing yards per game.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 A 2-22 season for the Big Green volleyball team ended in sour fashion, as the team dropped fourteen straight decisions to end the year. The team defeated Harvard in a hard-fought five set victory in its first Ivy League decision before dropping the rest of its Ancient Eight contests, winning only five sets the remainder of the year and none in its last six matches. Junior Elisa Scudder represented a bright spot on the squad, taking home Academic All-Ivy honors in addition to ranking 10th in the conference in hitting percentage (.283) and blocks per set (0.74) during conference play.
 
Men’s Golf:
 After finishing first last year in the Ancient Eight, Dartmouth’s men golf team has struggled to begin the season. Currently fifth in the Ivy League after its third tournament, Dartmouth has an average score seven strokes higher in 2012 than last season and has not yet notched a win after three in nine tournaments last season. However, two Dartmouth golfers rank in the top 10 and sophomore Charlie Edler has improved fourteen places and ranks fifth in the Ivy League.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 Although the team has fallen one spot in the Ivy League rankings, Dartmouth’s golf team has seen marked improvement this season. The team’s average score has fallen nearly eight strokes while its score versus par has decreased by five strokes. The team graduated top-30 Ivy League golfer Marietta Smith in 2012 but returned seventh-ranked Abram Lee, whose rank has dropped—much like the team’s as a whole—despite improving by one stroke to par and two strokes overall.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 Dartmouth had a historic season in 2012, winning 13 games to mark the most victories the team has had since the turn of the century. The team lost just one Ivy League game and ended the season with seven straight victories, culminating with a 3-0 victory in Ithaca for the team’s final game of the season. Freshman Corey Delaney took home conference Rookie of the Year honors (the team’s first outright winner since 1983) and five Big Green were named to the All-Iv first team (along with Daleny, Aurelia Solomon, Chrissy Lozier, Emma Brush, and Tatiana Saunders made the team)
 
Men’s Soccer:
The Big Green men’s soccer team excelled at home in 2012, finishing 6-1 overall and an undefeated 4-0 against Ivy League foes. The team had two members named to the All-Ivy team. Sophomore forward Alex Adelabu tallied a team-best nine goals, finishing second in the Ivy League in goals per game (0.56), points per game (1.31), and goals. In addition to making the All-Ivy first team, Adelabu ranked 41st in the country in total goals.
 
Field Hockey:
 Continuing its three-year improvement, Dartmouth finished second in the Ivy League in field hockey, scoring six wins in the league for the first time in four years. The Big Green won eleven games, including eight of its last ten. Dartmouth was the only team to score on Princeton—which outscored its opponents 45-1 over the course of the Ivy League system—and lost only one game at home all season. Goalkeeper Jenna Stearns allowed only 21 goals all season, second best in the conference and forward Ali Savage’s 26 points were fifth in the Ivy League.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the University of Pennsylvania Quakers.
Football:
 Much like Princeton, Penn football had a poor start to the year with two consecutive non-conference losses before notching its first win in Hanover at the end of September. The team, which used a victory against Dartmouth to jumpstart a four game winning streak in 2011, lost two of the next three games (including a defeat against league cellar dweller Yale) before rattling off four wins to end the season, none by more than nine points. That included wins over Princeton (leading the league at the time) and Harvard (reigning league champion) in back-to-back weeks that put Penn atop the Ivy League for the third time in four seasons.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
 Two years after back-to-back titles, the Penn volleyball team slid to fourth in the Ancient Eight standings. After winning six of seven in late October, the team won only six of 16 contested sets in November, losing three of its last four—including two losses to teams ranked above them in the standings that dropped it from second to fourth to close the season. In a bright spot, Dani Sheperd and Emma White finished one-two in the conference in digs, combining for 1,028 on the year.
 
Men’s Golf:
 Through four tournaments, the Penn men’s golf team has struggled to maintain its performance of a year ago. The team as a whole is scoring five shots worse versus par despite having five golfers in the top 25. The loss of departed top-10 golfer Scott Williams, the second best golfer on the Quakers a year ago, has created a void that hasn’t yet been filled. Junior Max Marisco ranks third in the conference and has posted better scores than a year ago but the rest of the team hasn’t yet caught up.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 The only team in the Ivy League which has seen its average round score go up between last season and this season, the Penn women’s golf team has struggled to replace 12th-ranked Tiffany Cheung. Cheung was the second best Quaker golfer last year and while sophomore Amanda Chin has improved by three strokes a round, the team hasn’t been as consistent as a year ago, when they finished fourth in the Ancient Eight.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 For the fourth time in six seasons, the Penn Quakers entered the final weekend of the women’s soccer season with a chance to win the league outright with a victory. However, the team fell, 4-2, to the Princeton Tigers to drop them down to third in the final standings as the Tigers finished off an unblemished 7-0 perfect season. Three Penn players—seniors Erin Beck and Alex Daynecka as well as junior Kerry Scalora—were named first-team All-Ivy standards and the team earned the National Soccer Coaches Association of America team Academic Award for the 12th time in 13 seasons (award is given to teams with an average GPA above 3.0).
 
Men’s Soccer:
 After struggling for most of the year, in the season finale the Penn men’s soccer team defeated Harvard, 3-1, to climb out of the Ivy League cellar in its first Ancient Eight win of the season. Four members of the team took home All-Ivy honors with Travis Cantrell and Duke Lacroix notching second-team distinction Johny Dolezal and Stephen Baker garnering honorable mentions. After losing six straight to start the season, the team won both games it played at the Princeton Invitational en route to victories in three of its final ten games.
Field Hockey:
Penn continued its climb out of the Ivy League basement, improving its conference standing for the second straight year after finishing last in the conference in 2010. The Quakers finished fourth in the Ancient Eight and above .500 overall, winning three of four before a season-ending 7-0 loss to the Princeton Tigers. Sarah Hanson ranked tenth in the league in points but defensive struggles betrayed a Penn squad that gave up 51 goals, highest in the league.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Next up, the Princeton Tigers.
Football:
 Picked before the season to finish last in the Ivy League, the Princeton Tigers shocked the Ancient Eight with four consecutive victories in October after losing their first two games. The final game of that winning streak, a 39-34 triumph over the Harvard Crimson where the Tigers trailed by 24 in the final quarter, was the best of the Ivy League season. The Tigers squandered a golden opportunity to take the crown with consecutive narrow losses to Cornell (37-35) and Penn (28-21) in the following weeks but the season must be considered a success for a team that finished tied for last in the league in 2011—with a point differential of -109 that was 31 points worse than fellow laughing stock Columbia. Quarterback Connor Michelsen was the offensive leader for the Tigers, passing for 1,634 yards on the season.
 
Water Polo: 
 The Princeton men’s water polo team ended its season ranked 20th in the nation and defeated rival Brown at the team’s biggest competition, the CWPA Eastern championships. Men’s water polo coach Luis Nicolao was voted the CWPA Sportsman of the Year and sophomore Drew Hoffenberg and senior Tim Wenzlau were named to CWPA All-Southern teams, Hoffenberg making the first team and Wenzlau receiving second team honors. Wenzalu had an all-around good season, tallying up 37 goals, 24 assists, 32 steals, and 6 blocks.
 
Women’s Volleyball:
Despite losing three straight games to end the season, the Princeton volleyball team finished tied for second in the league, winning 11 more sets than it lost. Late losses to the league’s other top squads—Yale, Cornell, and Columbia—cost a squad a chance to win the league entering November. Outside hitter Lydia Rudnick had a terrific year, however, leading the league in kills with 370, 77 more than the closest competitor. Rudnick and Kendall Peterkin earned First-Team All-Ivy nods. Rudnick was a unanimous choice for the third year in a row while Peterkin was one of just two freshman named to the team.
 
Men’s Golf:
Through three tournaments, the Princeton men’s golf team is outperforming last year’s team, in no small part due to the efforts of freshman Quinn Pchal. Prchal is tied for sixth in the Ivy League, averaging three strokes above par per round and only 73.75 overall. He is part of a top-heavy Tiger squad with four members in the top 16 of the Ancient Eight but no other player in the top 40. With Bernie D’Amato (7th last year, currently 13th) not playing up to recent form and missing departed 2012 graduate Evan Harmeling (12th last year), the rest of the team has stepped up to compensate for their departures.
Women’s Golf:
 After a season in which it finished last in the Ivy League without winning a tournament, the Princeton women’s golf team has completely flipped the script in 2012. The team ranks second in the Ancient Eight behind the Harvard Crimson—who have four of the top five golfers in the Ivy League—and has improved by nearly 22 shots a game from a year ago. Kelly Shon—the Tigers’ only top-15 golfer from a year ago—ranks third in the conference by more than two shots versus par and is on pace to surpass her two tournament wins of a season ago with one in her first three events. Freshmen Anna Jang and Sydney Kersten rank in the top 20 golfers and the team already has a win after going two years between victories.
 
Women’s Soccer:
 Princeton soccer completed a historic season in 2012, with five players named to the All-Ivy first team for the first time since 1981. The eight total nominees surpassed the program record set in 2000 and senior Jen Hoy was named the Ivy League Player of the Year. Princeton did not lose a contest in the Ivy League, finishing with an unblemished 7-0 record. Hoy led the team in goals with 17, the second most in Princeton history and the most in the Ivy League since 2004. Hoy finished first in the conference in scoring and points and was third in the country in goals per game.
 
Men’s Soccer:
 A year after finishing seventh in the Ivy League—beating out only Harvard—the Princeton men’s soccer team finished fourth in 2012. The team lost only one game in conference play, a narrow 1-0 decision in Ithaca, and won four straight after losing three in a row at the beginning of the season. In postseason honors, freshman Thomas Sanner was named the Ivy League Rookie of the Year while senior defender Mark Linnville was named first-team All-Ivy for the fourth straight year.
 
Field Hockey:
In a season where the team won 21 of its 22 contests, outscoring opponents in conference by a 45-1 goal margin, and took home the national championship to boot, the Princeton field hockey team can be said to have had unqualified success in 2012. The team—whose loss on the last game of the regular season cost it an outright Ivy League title in 2011—won fourteen games in a row after its only loss of the season, a 2-0 September 23rd defeat at the hands of Syracuse. The team had five of the top ten goalscorers in the Ivy League, with forward Kathleen Sharkley leading the league in goals, points, and shots while Christina Malda led the league in goals against, saving 75% of the shots against her.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the spring semester already having begun at Dartmouth but around the corner for the rest of the Ancient Eight, The Crimson takes a look at the fall semester for each athletic program and the season that was in each major sport. Last, and almost definitely least, the Yale Bulldogs.
Football:
 After a tumultuous offseason, the Yale football team entered 2012 with a new coach and were picked to finish fifth in the Ivy League. The Bulldogs played their best against the class of the Ancient Eight, defeating the Quakers at home by two touchdowns (the only Ivy League team to defeat Penn in 2012) and putting themselves in a position to win The Game late in the fourth quarter before Crimson running back Treavor Scales scampered for a game-sealing touchdown run late. Running back Tyler Varga, who accounted for 117 yards per game and eight touchdowns on the ground—including a 220 yard, three touchdown effort in a 26-22 loss to Columbia—was named to the FCS All-America squad in December and was the team’s best player. However, while the Bulldogs played up to the level of their higher-quality opponents they also were susceptible to duds against the lower rungs of the Ancient Eight, losing by 39 points to Cornell and by 4 to Columbia, who combined for two wins against non-Yale Ivy League squads.
Women’s Volleyball:
 Capturing its third straight Ancient Eight title (second outright), the Yale women’s volleyball team went a perfect 14-0 in conference play, dropping only six sets against the 42 it won. Junior Kendall Polan was named the Ivy League Player of the Year after finishing fifth in the conference in assists per set and tenth in kills per set. She led the team in assists, ranking third in kills, and produced seven triple-doubles (in kills, assists, and digs) during the season. Polan was later named a Division I Honorable Mention All-American.
 
Men’s Golf:
The Yale men’s golf team has proved to be the surprise of the season so far in the Ancient Eight. The sixth-place squad from last year is up to first, shooting ten shots better as a team (seven better versus par) and senior Brad Kushner and junior Sam Bernstein share the title of best golfer in the Ivy League—averaging an identical 72.43 round score (2.29 versus par). Colin Sheehan’s team has already captured a title on the year, winning the Macdonald Cup on September 30th.
 
Women’s Golf: 
 Having improved twelve strokes as a team since last year, the Yale women’s golf team currently stands third in the Ivy League. Two years after capturing seven titles, the Bulldogs have played more tournaments—five—than any other team and are tied for the league lead in wins with one. Although the team has no golfer in the top five, it is a model of consistency with five golfers in the top 20 and seven in the top 30. Number one golfer junior Seo Hee Moon has improved on a sophomore season where she ranked sixth in the Ancient Eight and won one of the eight tournaments she entered, shooting nearly two whole shots better versus par then in 2011-2012.
 
Girls’ Soccer:
 For the 10th time in eleven years, the Yale women’s soccer team finished with a winning record, albeit barely. The Bulldogs finished 8-7-2 overall, 1-4-2 in the Ivy League, and outscored opponents 20-9 in nonconference games before struggling to score against conference competition. Yale netted only six goals in seven conference games, but finished the year with five goals in four games. The Bulldogs were undefeated (2-0-2) in their last four contests and defeated Brown, 1-0, on Senior Night.
 
Boys’ Soccer:
 A year after four wins netted the Yale men’s soccer team a fifth place finish in the Ivy League, the Bulldogs finished with only one win but scored a sixth place finish. The Bulldogs defeated only Penn in their last nine games, coming away with three other ties and six losses in which they did not score a goal. This was a common theme for the Bulldogs, who never lost a game that they scored in. In postseason recognition, Junior Nick Alers was named a first team academic All-American after receiving honorable mention All-Ivy recognition for his play.
 
Field Hockey:
 A year after a last-game loss by the Princeton Tigers opened the door for the Yale field hockey team’s split conference championship, Yale stumbled to a 6-11 season and won only three of seven Ivy League contests. The team lost nine of thirteen after winning two of the first four and suffered shutout losses to BU, Virginia, Syracuse, Cornell, Princeton, Fairfield, and Connecticut. Goalkeeper Emily Cain ranked second in the conference in saves and sixth in save percentage but a distant seventh in goals against. No Bulldog ranked in the top ten in the conference in either assists of goals and its top point scorer, Erica Borgo, finished a distant twenty third in the Ancient Eight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ivy League basketball hosted a midseason teleconference last week with each head coach speaking about the state of their teams going into conference play. The Back Page brings you the most interesting and relevant statements by each coach.
Yale coach Chris Gobrecht on freshman stepping up because of injuries:
“The biggest thing for us has just been bringing our freshman up to speed and getting our team healthy. We have not been a whole team yet this year.… We have a way that we play that is a very fast, very aggressive game, and it’s not an easy thing for a freshman to jump right in and play it. There’s nothing conventional about what we do, so it takes a while to catch on.”
Princeton coach Courtney Banghart on guard Lauren Polanski’s return from injury and how it will affect playing time for the team’s other guards:
“She’s cleared, we’re just being conservative. We’re gaining valuable experience for other kids, and now that the league is here, she’s ready to get after it.… We’re better when we have more players healthy, so having [Polanski] back as the two-time reigning defensive player of the year—who’s quite disruptive and probably our best rebounder—will help us. We’ll get minutes for the kids who have earned it and the kids who help us win. My goal is to help the team win, not get any individual her highlight.”
Penn coach Mike McLaughlin on overcoming a bad start:
“We opened the season and didn’t play that well our first time out. Then we bounced back against a good Virginia team at home, and although we came up short on the scoreboard, I did think we did some unbelievable things there…. We were involved in a lot of close games, and we were fortunate enough to win most of the ones we were in there. I think our confidence level is pretty good.”
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith on replacing Brogan Berry: 
 “We added some new young players to our system and I have always believed that it takes time for that to come together, and I'm more than happy with how quickly they're growing and improving every day, every game… Ali Curtis, basically a freshman because she didn't play at all last year, is our starting point guard and had to fill Brogan Berry's shoes, and I feel those are big shoes to fill. She's doing a great job and I'm surprised and actually thrilled with how quickly she's come in and led this team at the point for such a young player.”
Dartmouth coach Chris Wielgus on her only senior, captain Faziah Steen:
“She just works so hard on her game. She’s so gentle and good with the young kids. She takes them under her wing. She’s worked very hard on her game in the offseason. She’s pretty much a standstill shooter, she can get herself to the rim now, she does a great job for us on the defensive end, and she’s overcome a lot of adversity herself. She’s had numerous surgeries. It’s her senior year and she’s as healthy as she’s ever been. We’re real pleased with her.”
Cornell coach Dayna Smith on improving the backcourt’s consistency:
“We need to improve upon our consistency. I think that’s the thing our staff has been most disappointed in is just staying at a more consistent level game in and game out. But we’re making great strides and just excited for the opportunity to begin the Ivy League season.…
Our trio of guards has to step up and be more consistent with shooting, Shelby Lyman, Stephanie Long, and Taylor Flynn. We have games they’re on fire or two of three of them can really knock shots down, and it opens things up a little bit inside…. We just have to get more consistent with the three of them, and they’re all very, very capable of doing that.”
Columbia coach Paul Nixon on the Lions’ 2-12 record:
“On paper right now the general public might not think that we’re a very good team, but I can assure you that the young women in our locker room and the staff know that the opinion that really matters is the one in our locker room. We don’t just believe, we know we’re a good basketball team, and we’ve shown that at a number of different points this season. We’ve played a number of games that we haven’t been able to quite pull out down the stretch, but we’ve gained some valuable experience.”
Brown coach Jean Marie Burr on the start of conference play:
“We’re going through a tough patch coming off the Holy Cross game…. It’s nice for us to feel the pain of that and then watch them in practice [last Thursday] come back and work so hard. So, going into Ivy play is exciting. Back-to-back play makes it a tournament weekend every weekend….  I have players—every single one of them on my team—who have a passion for putting Brown across their chest, playing the game, and they’re just really competitive. When I have a group that I’m working with like that, I have to be excited, not just for Ivy League play but for the next game or the next practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-captain Jillian Dempsey only waited eight seconds to extend her point streak to 30 games Tuesday night against Connecticut. Junior Kalley Armstrong won the opening faceoff to classmate Lyndsey Fry, who advanced deep into the zone with the puck before dropping it back to Dempsey for a lightning-quick strike.
The No. 2/3 Harvard women's hockey team never looked back after that. At the Bright Hockey Center, the Crimson (14-1-1, 11-0-0 ECAC) controlled the ice from start to finish to skate past UConn (3-17-2, 1-8-0 Hockey East), 5-1.
"We like to talk about scoring early and often, so it was nice that we were able to do a little bit of both," Dempsey said.
Dempsey turned in her fifth multi-goal performance of the season as she registered her 19th and 20th goals of the season. After drawing a roughing minor from the Huskies’ Margaret Zimmer to put Harvard on the man advantage, the senior  tapped in her second of the night off a rebound from sophomore defender Sarah Edney  to put Harvard up, 3-1, 5:30 into the second period.
"[Dempsey's] consistency  and relentlessness are the best examples for any young player in the game," Crimson coach Katey Stone said. "She's not trying to be fancy; she's just trying to be consistent."
Harvard came roaring out of the gates, jumping out to a 2-0 lead after five minutes of play with a goal from senior Kaitlin Spurling. The forward skated the puck out from behind the Husky net before slinging a wrister from the slot.
The Crimson dominated the first half of the first period, registering 13 shots on goal before UConn could muster one. But the Huskies found the net on their second shot of the game 15 minutes into the first with an unassisted marker from Kaitlin Hughes. The goal was the first tally by a visiting women's team at the Bright Hockey Center since Dec. 7.
"That [goal] was a little bit frustrating, especially with how few shots they got on net, but it was good in the sense that [UConn] battled. We knew they were going to come hard, and everybody's going to play us as hard as they can and give us one of their best games," Dempsey said. "It was a little bit of a challenge for us to figure out how we were going to respond to that, and we took that as incentive to work harder and put pucks on the net."
Harvard increased its stranglehold on the game after the first intermission. The Crimson added another two goals in the second frame while allowing only two shots on net.
Three minutes after Dempsey's power play goal, Fry swatted a Connecticut lob pass out of the air at center ice to lead the Crimson on a 3-on-2 break. Fry slid the biscuit to Armstrong, who fed sophomore defender Michelle Picard in front of the net for Harvard's fourth strike of the night.
"[Picard] has great timing," Stone said. "She knows when to jump into a play; she has a good sense of where pucks are going to pop out."
Picard, who entered the month with zero career collegiate goals, now has three goals in Harvard's last five games.
"Maybe a little bit of luck has just been finding the back of the net for me," Picard said, laughing. "Since last year, Coach has been getting on all of us defensemen to join up in the play and make it a four-point attack. So I've been focusing on it, and recently for whatever reason they've been going in."
The Crimson cruised through the third period as freshman goaltender Molly Tissenbaum relieved co-captain Laura Bellamy in net. UConn only forced Tissenbaum to make two stops in twenty minutes as Harvard finished the night outshooting the Huskies, 42-8. Harvard's NCAA-leading penalty kill unit turned away all four UConn power play opportunities.
"We used our speed really well today," Picard said. "We didn't give them any time with the puck."
Junior Margaret Chute wrapped up the scoring for the Crimson as the forward buried a top-shelf backhand with eight minutes left to play off a game-high third assist from Armstrong. The goal was Chute's first of the season and second of her career.
"[Chute] works so hard day in and day out and doesn't always get as many opportunities to go out there and show it," Dempsey said. "For her to get that beautiful backhander today, we're all fired up about that."
With the win, Harvard extends its unbeaten streak to 11 games. The Crimson will wrap up its longest home stand of the season this weekend in ECAC tilts against RPI and Union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, Google is celebrating the 112th birthday of Frank Zamboni, the Italian-American inventor of the ice -resurfacing machine that bears his name, with an interactive doodle. Zamboni filed a patent for the "Model A Zamboni Ice Resurfacer" in 1949, 51 years after Harvard played its first intercollegiate game versus Brown. While The Crimson does not seem to have the Zamboni's Cambridge debut on record, the ice resurfacer's name has appeared in more than 70 Crimson articles. Many of these references are merely corny figures of speech, such as "Zamboni-sized goose egg," "Zamboni-sized thighs," and "Zamboni of the mind," but the Zamboni has enjoyed a colorful history at Harvard. Here are the top three Zamboni-related Crimson stories to celebrate its creator's birthday:
3. December 5, 1973: Zamboni-induced ditch foreshadows Dartmouth comeback
A Zamboni stalled in the middle of the ice during the second intermission of a closely-contested Harvard-Dartmouth men's hockey game at the Crimson's old home, the Donald C. Watson Rink. In an effort to get the ice resurfacer moving again, the Zamboni driver revved up the engine, which released ice-melting exhaust that created a substantial ditch in the rink. Before the third period's opening faceoff, the two teams agreed to trade sides of the ice 10 minutes into the final frame so that each team defended the defective area of the ice for an equal amount of time. While there is no indication that the ditch affected the game, the Big Green mounted a third period comeback, scoring two unanswered goals to win, 5-4.
2. Jack Kirrane, Zamboni driver and Olympic gold medalist, retires
Jack Kirrane served as the Bright Hockey Center's rink manager for 15 years. Before that, he was the captain of the U.S. Olympic hockey team. Kirrane led Team USA to its first Olympic hockey gold medal at the 1960 Games in Squaw Valley, Calif. The defenseman notably played alongside ‘Miracle On Ice’ coach Herb Brooks, who was cut from the U.S. Olympic roster a week before the 1960 opening ceremonies. Kirrane also served 38 years in the Brookline, Massachusetts Fire Department, and he was inducted into the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame in 1987. But he may be best remembered by Crimson hockey fans as the Zamboni driver.
1. November 5, 2000: Two Zambonis go up in flames
Well, not quite. One of Harvard's Zambonis appeared to catch fire before a Sunday afternoon women's hockey game against Minnesota. Despite a smoky Bright Hockey Center, the game could have started on time, but the Crimson's backup Zamboni also malfunctioned, apparently leaking battery acid or antifreeze onto the ice. After Harvard obtained a replacement Zamboni from the Massachusetts District Commission ice rink, the Crimson and the Gophers were able to play two days later. Unfortunately for Harvard, the Curse of the Zamboni struck again as Minnesota erased an early deficit to win, 3-2.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While most Harvard students will be spending the week before Jan. 28 relaxing before classes begin or wrapping up a J-term project, Emily Hannah will be 3900 miles away from Cambridge, accomplishing a much different goal.
Along with five others women, the freshman Nordic skier was named to the 2013 FIS Junior World Championship team based on results from the past week’s US Cross Country Ski Championships in Soldier Hollow, Utah.
Hannah skied to a second-place finish in the 5-km skate race at the national championships to secure her spot on the Junior World Championship team, a first for any Crimson cross-country skier.
But the honor isn’t completely novel for the Colorado native, who also made the team in 2012 as a J1 (ages 16-17) athlete. At the 2012 Junior Worlds, held in Erzurum, Turkey, Hannah placed 51st in the women’s skiathlon event.
This year, the freshman will again head off to take on the best 18 and 19-year-old skiers in the world—this time in Liberec, Czech Republic, where the 2013 FIS Nordic Junior and U23 World Championships will be held from Jan. 20 to Jan. 27. Over a thousand semi-professional and collegiate Nordic skiers will convene to compete for both individual and team honors.
“Most Harvard students realize how many adjustments you make as a freshman, just going from high school to college, but then as an athlete, you’re also making adjustments to a new coach, a new training plan, new teammates, and that’s a big adjustment, so it’s not unusual in those circumstances to have an athlete take a year just to get used to skiing at the college level,” Nordic coach Chris City said. “I think it says so many things about Emily’s focus and determination to be able to manage all of those things and still be able to ski at this level. I’m excited to see what she can do on her second trip to World Juniors with a little more familiarity with the racing environment expectations.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Ides of January brought no relief to Jeremy Lin ’10 and his Houston Rockets team as they lost their fourth game of the week, falling this time to the Los Angeles Clippers, 117-109.
It was a tale of two halves in Tuesday’s contest as Houston controlled both the tempo and the score in the opening 24 minutes and, accordingly, held the lead at the break. But intermission seemed to be a breaking point in the game as only 50 seconds into the third quarter Los Angeles took the lead on a Blake Griffin put-back and never looked back. The Clippers would go on a 25-to-six run in the next 5:39, putting the game to bed long before the end of the third quarter.
“Honestly, I think we just couldn't get a rhythm,” explained Lin in his post-game interview. “[The Clippers] were getting everything but we were not getting any stops. I think we just lacked the ball movement and the energy and the thrust and pace that we played with in the first half.”
While his team struggled, Lin notched the only double-double of the night, putting up 12 points and 10 assists, 40 percent of the Rockets total dimes for the game. Though his efficiency rating was still in the negatives, -12, the Harvard alum was uncharacteristically low in turnovers, recording only one mistake in 35 minutes of playing time.
While the Clippers’ star point guard Chris Paul was out for the second consecutive game due to a bruised kneecap, LA’s backup guard, Eric Bledsoe, tied a team-high of 19 points. Bledsoe was one of four Clipper players to go 100 percent from the charity stripe, a marked contrast from the 56 percent free throw shooting of Lin’s Rockets.
Houston will have a chance to break its losing streak when it heads to Dallas for another intra-conference matchup against the Mavericks. That contest will be the first of a four-game road swing for this Rockets team, on which it will play only one squad boasting a winning percentage higher than .500.
