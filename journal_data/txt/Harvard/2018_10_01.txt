After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Five years ago, when Lorde’s breakout single “Royals” topped Billboard’s Hot 100 chart at number one for nine consecutive weeks, other songs burned through the radio with a similar near-dystopian disillusionment: Imagine Dragons was living in an apocalyptic universe with “Radioactive,” and Lady Gaga was lamenting over the perils of fame in “Applause.” Some songs found relief in destined romance, reveling in their uniqueness in a cruel world: The Neighbourhood’s “Sweater Weather” relished in the coldness that it warned against for the warmth of a rather possessive intimacy, and Capital Cities noted to a lover that even through hurricanes, tidal waves, and falling skies, they’ll be “safe and sound.” In my small town, these songs populated the airwaves with angst and melancholy — quintessential backdrops to classic, suburban, monotonous teenagehood, promising realities that were more fantastical, dangerous, and attractive than our own.
But “Royals” broke through 2013’s dystopian escapism with a voice that was resolutely proud of being from the suburbs, despite it claiming otherwise (“And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town / No postcode envy”). And it was only one piece of a 10-song album — coyly entitled “Pure Heroine” — that challenged the way we talk, sing, and make art about teens. (NPR notes Billie Eilish, Khalid, and Alessia Cara as other young artists who went on to carry similar themes in their work after the debut of “Pure Heroine.”) Her particular brand of cold pop made a monochromatic landscape shine, chronicling adolescence with both sincerity and careful jadedness, and affording it the romanticization that is usually offered to towering, sparkling cities.
Lorde sets the terms for this most acutely in the first song of “Pure Heroine.” “Tennis Court” bustles with a push-pull motion, simultaneously aching with ambition (“Never not chasing a million things I want”) and wistful wonderment for its roots (“Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane / I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space”). It acknowledges the triviality of high school politics through the archetypes of Queen Bees and class clowns, undercutting its importance in the very first line as Lorde directly asks the listener, “Don't you think that it's boring how people talk?” Of course, Lorde doesn’t care about the tired stereotypes — she continuously says she doesn’t in the song. But even so, there’s a small recognition for the intricacies of these playground rules when Lorde repeats, “Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah” as the song winds down.
It’s not always disenchantment, as shown by the next piece, “400 Lux,” a love song to the suburbs. Like “Tennis Court,” “400 Lux” also starts with a question: “We're never done with killing time / Can I kill it with you?” Even though it begins addressing a person, the song quickly transforms into a beautiful romance with a landscape and all its innocuous peculiarities. Lorde’s microscopic vision hones in on the little things: the heating in the car, ready to pick her up for yet another wandering drive; hollow bottles to match hollow hearts; and the roads with the never-changing houses and streets lined with trees, where it’s clear she wants to stay.
Not every song is so explicitly and unabashedly in love with the suburbs — Lorde draws metaphors between gladiator battles and the myth of the celebrity in “Glory and Gore,” and she writes about “explosions on TV” and a hologram life in “Buzzcut Season.” But the album as a whole is textured through with the mannerisms and details of small town life, casting the landscape in a dreamy light. The plague of puberty-induced acne becomes “skin in craters like the moon” in “Team.” “Ribs” mourns childhood and the eventual departure from one’s hometown, convinced that “You're the only friend I need / Sharing beds like little kids / Laughing 'til our ribs get tough.” When the setting shifts to stranger lands, like in “Still Sane,” the song is marked by a new loneliness: “Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high / Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified,” Lorde sings slowly, carefully, with an enhanced trepidation that follows her through the song about her “newfound fame.” “I still like hotels, but I think that'll change,” she sings, a new anxiety marking a tonal shift and a new landscape.
The suburbs aren’t always drenched in lights unlike in dazzling metropolises, and its teenagers aren’t always considered to be the wisest demographic. But Lorde’s “Pure Heroine” dismantled the patronizing depiction of small town teenagehood, carving out its graces for those who weren’t aware that they were there. And it shocked the world: After Lorde released her first album, the Internet was populated with “Lorde Age Truthers,” obsessed with finding out whether or not Lorde was a grown woman, resting on the conviction that an artwork as mature as “Pure Heroine” could not have been written by the teenagers its storylines revolve around.
Eventually, Hairpin put a rest to the controversy by obtaining her birth certificate and publishing it online (a rather bizarre act that both validated Lorde’s merit as a teenage artist while invading her privacy). “A lot of people seem to think that all teenagers are, like, super-misguided and not at all ambitious and just kind of, like, dropkicks,” she said to The Evening Standard. “Such a high proportion of the people my age I know are super driven, super focused and super creative in a way I haven’t seen a lot of adults in this business being.” A Rolling Stone profile on Lorde wrote that she was “the sort of teen you forget is a teen.” A review from Consequence of Sound called Lorde a “gifted songwriter for her age” and said “Pure Heroine” was “a very grown-up album despite its teenage topics.” The piece went on to refer Lorde as “this girl.” Another review — this time from Rolling Stone — wrote that she was “16, but she could be 25.”
And yet, there Lorde was — definitely 16, definitely not a “grown woman,” and definitely dominating the music industry by being the first female solo artist in 17 years to top Billboard’s alternative chart with “Royals” and selling 3.4 million copies of her 2013 debut album by 2014. Her success validated overlooked narratives of teenagehood and afforded them the sophistication they were deprived of. And she did so by writing about the “cities you'll never see onscreen” and its people, because for her, they were the ones that mattered the most.

This year’s Emmys hosts, Colin Jost and Michael Che, resembled flight attendants who ask for the last time, through resigned smiles, that you fasten your seatbelt. They avoided egregious misfires, but their wan deliveries probably only barely prevented the expressive meme darling Chrissy Teigen from falling asleep on John Legend’s shoulder again. The joint hosting may have helped reflect the most diverse group of nominees in Emmy history, but “the more the merrier” was not the case Monday night as they lacked the ebullient chattiness of Seth Meyers and the jocular charm of Jimmy Kimmel, both former solo hosts.
Some of their of-the-moment quips were clever and revelatory of the changing landscape of television, especially sprinkled amid the program’s retrospective segments, which included a tribute to Aretha Franklin and other late television stars, and a hilarious “Reparations Emmys” bit in which Michael Che rewarded erstwhile nominees whose talents were overlooked in favor of white artists. They rightfully balked at Netflix’s content monopoly and its all-too permissive taste, having amassed around 700 original series: “If you’re a network executive, that’s the scariest thing you could possibly hear, except maybe, ‘Sir, Ronan Farrow is on Line 1.’” (Farrow won the Pulitzer Prize in 2018 for his New Yorker exposés of industry linchpins Harvey Weinstein and recently, Les Moonves.) In one of his most successful jokes, Jost pitched an all-white reboot of “Atlanta” called “15 Miles Outside of Atlanta,” in which white women would call the police on the cast of “Atlanta.” But he so often deployed his “Weekend Update” deadpan, as if flipping through a soberingly unadorned Powerpoint presentation, that it took a moment to realize that some of the things he’d said were actually funny.
The tone of the night modulated unpredictably from bland to perfectly, spontaneously sentimental, to slightly zany and affectatious, in no particular order. “Saturday Night Live” veterans Kenan Thompson and Kate McKinnon welcomed the “One of Each” dancers to the stage, to mock Hollywood’s parading of its meager diversity achievements, its smug attempts to check “every box.” Jost and Che seemed to have approached their repertoire with the same ethos; aside from some hits, their socially conscious jokes seemed defensive, as if they had scribbled all the work they could show for a math problem, without a conclusive answer. The way diversity zingers were wedged into every presentation made the program the most drily comprehensive one possible. The references almost became galling when they were on-the-nose, like when Emilia Clarke served a weak, “The comedy writing category, once dominated by white male nerds, now boasts more female and diverse nerds than ever before.”
In a heartwarming moment, Glenn Weiss proposed to his girlfriend Jan, on stage, to resounding whoops and cheers. In a gloriously simple bit, Sandra Oh—the first Asian woman to be nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series—ripped the envelope, and screeched, “The winner is ‘La La Land!’” No one seemed very surprised when Rachel Brosnahan won the Emmy for Outstanding Leading Actress in a Comedy Series, including herself. She deserved it, for her bitingly witty, cannily brash Midge Maisel in “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” and she honored Midge’s self-empowerment by encouraging the audience to vote. She also entertained while presenting with Larry David, as they discussed how awkward it is to attempt obligatory award-stage banter, feeling as if they’re on a blind date.
But some leaned too hard into awkwardness. A skit featuring unwitting presenters played by Fred Armisen and Maya Rudolph puttered on for too long, and perhaps demonstrated the uncritical indulgence of each other by the ‘Saturday Night Live’ mainstays who dominated the presentations and later gathered on stage to accept the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series, fraternizing with casual familiarity. Matthew Rhys won his long overdue Emmy for for his work in “The Americans,” an exquisitely suspenseful show about the politics of loyalty at a micro and macroscopic level. It is criminal, though, that his TV wife and real-life partner, Keri Russell, also nominated, didn’t win for her role as the grittily resilient KGB agent Elizabeth Jennings.
Amid the carefully calibrated spectacles, there were some nuggets of authenticity to behold. An utterly dumbfounded Merritt Wever fumbled through her acceptance speech for the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series Emmy after attempting to read from a crumpled piece of paper, and managed a simply affecting, “I’m still shocked that you’ve made a space for me and [my character] Mary Agnes.” Betty White’s appreciative cheeriness ballasted the wilting white flag that took the form of hackneyed jokes by Che and Jost about television being a movie-star’s second choice. She said, with twinkling eyes, “It’s incredible that I’m still in this business and that you are still putting up with me...It’s such a blessed business to be in.” It seems that the industry has indeed had its share of tribulations, in the face of #MeToo upheavals, in its inadequate and halting efforts at diverse representation, but who better to restore hope in television’s endurance and special charm than Betty White?

Fall is upon us. For some, that may mean pumpkin-spice everything, while others are excited for peak sweater weather. The best part about fall, however, is clearly the massive slate of new shows! Here are five of the best new and returning shows.
“Forever” 
A surreal, uncanny new series from “Master of None” impresario Alan Yang and “30 Rock” veteran Matt Hubbard ‘00, “Forever” drags with it an undertow of melancholy, palpable in every slow-boiling scene strung with tension. Those with short attention spans or those who look askance at shows that don’t trade in glamorous subjects or stimulating music will find themselves unexpectedly enthralled by the show’s ponderous silences. It peddles an optimism about humanity along with sobering meditations on passing time, regret, and roads not taken. The show’s somberness is counterbalanced by the larksome dynamic between the chameleonic impression experts, “Saturday Night Live” alums, Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, who struggle to redeem their insipid marriage in the afterlife. The show is a contingency to the happily-ever-afters dealt us by too many romantic comedies, and dares to be different without being gimmicky. Prepare to be unsettled by the intriguing rituals of the restless ghosts living out forever together. All eight episodes of the first season, which premiered on Sept. 14, are available on Amazon Prime.
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”
Amy Sherman Palladino, creator of the beloved “Gilmore Girls,” reprises the bracing dialogue that has become her signature in this sharp, wisecracking comedy. Rachel Brosnahan delivers a bravura performance as Midge Maisel, a woman who is very much a product of her time — the 1950s — which is to say, an overachieving student of housewifery. She encounters an opportunity to strike out on her own as a stand-up comic after organizing her casual notebook witticisms into a riotous and revolutionary routine. It’s refreshing to see a mother who sometimes shirks familial responsibility in favor of glorious independence, and to break a mold she has self-consciously but dutifully adopted to traffic in impropriety, especially to the chagrin of her traditional and equally entertaining parents (Tony Shalhoub and Marin Hinkle). You can come for a gorgeous, romantically nostalgic 1950s New York (the costumes and dive bars!), but you’ll stay for the raunchy jokes and brilliant heroines. The first season is available on Amazon Prime, and the second is set to premiere sometime this fall.
“Crazy Ex-Girlfriend”
In this zany dramedy by Aline Brosh McKenna and Rachel Bloom, who stars as the titular character, the distinguished lawyer Rebecca Bunch leaves her cushy New York life for the suburban nothingness of West Covina, California in the hopes of rekindling a relationship with her summer camp boyfriend of many moons ago, Josh Chan (Vincent Rodriguez III). It’s a show that is obsessed with love but isn’t schmaltzy about it; every seemingly happy ending has a caveat, and it isn’t triumphant or simplistic about all different kinds of relationships—platonic, romantic, and familial—that sometimes implode beyond recovery. The focus is Rebecca's addled interiority that resists classification, her troubled past, and her quest to battle her demons and find self-awareness. It boasts a repertoire of madcap musical numbers, from the silly “Sexy Getting Ready Song,” to the mocking “Let’s Generalize About Men.” They’re self-eviscerating, hilarious, raunchy, and catchy all at once. Bloom, who has discussed her own mental health struggles as well as ensured that Rebecca’s psychological tendencies have been well-researched, enacts a nuanced performance of jealousy, rage, guilt, and self-loathing, making her Rebecca relatable, flawed, and endlessly fascinating. The first three seasons are available on Netflix, and the fourth and final season will premiere on Oct. 12 on the CW.
“The Good Place”
“The Good Place” is brought to you by Michael Schur, known for his work on “The Office” and “Parks and Recreation.” Despite the availability of frozen yogurt flavors like “Unmitigated Joy” and “Unexpected Hotel Upgrade,” there’s something off-kilter about the Good Place which is presided over by a roguish godlike figure (Ted Danson). Good people are paired with soulmates, provided with tastefully but clinically furnished homes, and get ranked routinely on a neighborhood goodness scoreboard. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), by all accounts a bad person, has inexplicably found herself in the Good Place. After a lifetime of selfishness and an anticlimactic death, she remains impressionable under her barbed armor, and eager for moral tutelage. Schur, by employing a host of lovable characters both good and bad, suggests how unreliable those distinctions are. “The Good Place” abounds with absurd plot twists, daffy puns, and second chances. The first two seasons are available on Netflix, and the third premiered on Sept. 27.
“Speechless”
In this charming sitcom from  Scott Silveri of “Friends,” the DiMeo family grapples with everything from financial difficulty to the daily indignities that JJ (Micah Fowler), the oldest son and a teenager with cerebral palsy, faces. Minnie Driver plays his charismatic mother, Maya, who valiantly and humorously crusades against the shortsighted. His younger brother, the neurotic Ray (Mason Cook), tries to ground his family with his punctuality and self-consciousness. The brassy younger sister, Dylan (Kyla Kenedy), wise beyond her years, and Jimmy (John Ross Bowie), their impish father, round out the wacky ensemble. Together, the DiMeos learn to care less about what other people think, and their chemistry makes each scene spark with manic energy. The children are, after all, normal teenagers making new friends, pursuing their crushes, and casually schooling those who make a spectacle out of JJ. Watch this on a Saturday morning or Sunday night; it’s a family sitcom that has the throbbing heart of “New Girl,” that’s reminiscent of, but bubblier than “The Middle,” and is as reliably heartwarming as comfort food. The first two seasons are available on Hulu, and the third will premiere on ABC on Oct. 5.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the year, we laughed, rejoiced, screamed, panicked, and cried, a lot, with our favorite television characters. The 70th Primetime Emmy Awards on Monday brought together sci-fi clones, secret agents, a fab five group of style experts, and more, under one roof. For television's biggest night, it’s only natural for stars to bring the glitz and glam to the red carpet. Here’s who made The Crimson’s Emmys best dressed guest list.
Tracee Ellis Ross 
“Black-ish” star Tracee Ellis Ross didn’t just go for a pink-ish dress. Leave it to Ross to bring the drama with a giant, poofy hot pink Valentino Haute Couture gown. While she didn’t take home the Emmy for Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, she’s the winner for the night’s most memorable gown. With a slicked back bun and matching pink eyeshadow, Ross didn’t shy away from the electric pop of color. This year’s Emmy red carpet saw a lot of dark gowns, but way to think pink, Tracee.
Jessica Biel
They say you can’t have it all, but I think “Sinner” star Jessica Biel truly has it pretty close. Not only did she stun in a Ralph & Russo Couture white strapless gown, she had husband and singer Justin Timberlake in one hand and an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie in the other. The combination of the ivory scallop design with the tiered shape of the gown made it an intricate yet elegant and effortless ensemble. Also, bonus points on her lip color choice. You can never go wrong with the pop of red against a clean palette of white.
Angela Sarafyan 
When “Westworld” star Angela Sarafyan walked onto the red carpet, everyone’s jaw collectively dropped. Talk about a princess entrance. Completely covered in sparkling crystals, her Christian Siriano black embellished gown reminds me of the night sky filled with constellations. Keeping the hair and accessories simple with just a low ponytail and diamond earrings, Sarafyan makes sure all eyes stay focused on the star, quite literally, of her look.
Mandy Moore
Another black gown favorite goes to “This Is Us” actress Mandy Moore’s black and gold custom Rodarte number. While the dress is fairly simple, the plunge V-neckline and mermaid figure of the dress add sophisticated yet sultry touches. If the gold sequins weren’t enough, Harry Winston jewelry, including diamond drop earrings, added an additional glitz to this look.
Rachel Brosnahan
Rachel Brosnahan brought the red to the red carpet. The “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” star and winner in the Lead Actress in a Comedy Series category didn’t just stop with the red Oscar de la Renta dress, but she also wore red Schutz heels and a red lip. I particularly love the softness of the delicate off-the-shoulder contrasted with the boldness of the color. Safe to say Brosnahan showed up to win.

At Harvard, students have opinions — lots of them — even about films they have not seen themselves. And so, when I arrived back to my dorm room after seeing Michael Moore’s incendiary new documentary, “Fahrenheit 11/9,” my blockmates were eager to hear my thoughts on the film and its content. This led to the political debate of the century, continuing on for two hours as we argued about everything from gun control to free markets. And this is the power that Michael Moore’s newest documentary has: It gets people thinking, it gets people talking, and it gets people angry. Is it transparently biased, certainly more so than other documentaries? Absolutely. Is it necessary? Absolutely.
The documentary’s focus is on the 2016 presidential election and the two years following the election of President Donald Trump. The film begins on the night of the election, at Hillary Clinton’s victory party, and sets its bleak tone immediately as we watch the once hopeful and celebratory Hillary supporters slowly dissolve into tears as Trump’s victory becomes more and more certain. From there, the film delves deeply into events before and after Trump’s 2016 victory, including the Democratic Party’s sabotage of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the abhorrent behavior that has been demonstrated by some of America’s highest-ranking politicians. It ends with a powerful, albeit exaggerated, comparison between Trump’s administration and the Third Reich.
This broad review of recent history works to the film’s disadvantage, as it makes the organization choppy and difficult to follow. Moore transitions between topics rapidly and seemingly without intention, which makes connecting the different segments and creating a comprehensive picture difficult. He seems to care little about guiding his viewers through a logical, cohesive argument. Instead, his goal appears to be to devastate his viewers, to shock them with the level of corruption that has come to be a staple of the current administration, and to spur them to action. To this end, he is largely successful, but only at the expense of a single, easy-to-follow narrative.
Moore further undermines the documentary by focusing much of the film’s runtime on the water crisis in his hometown of Flint, Michigan, despite advertising the film as an in-depth exploration of Trump’s ascent to office and the country’s descent into partisan chaos. However, though seemingly beyond the scope of the documentary, the segments focusing on the water crisis are some of the film’s most powerful pieces, as they perfectly demonstrate the proliferation and acceptance of corruption that gave rise to Trump and has come to define his term in office. As Moore’s cameras zoom-in on the crying children of Flint, suffering from the lethal levels of lead in their bodies, there is at last a sense of how much these issues matter.
This is a crucial part of Moore’s documentary. In most people’s daily lives, their only exposure to these issues comes in the form of 10-minute segments on the evening news. In that way, it is easy to overlook or impassively attend to these issues. But “Fahrenheit 11/9” does not allow for that level of comfortable distance. It instead forces you to accept the brutal reality of these affairs as we stare into the eyes of those who have been poisoned or watch as school children flee from bullets in the Snapchat videos taken by those in Stoneman Douglas High School. Seeing the terrible reality makes it impossible to ignore. The key question that “Fahrenheit 11/9” makes viewers ask is: “How can I sit by and do nothing?”
More than anything, “Fahrenheit 11/9” serves as a warning. Moore channels his rage into his filmmaking to show audiences just how much has changed, what we have lost in the last two years, and how much we could still lose. Despite being unfocused and lacking a clear narrative structure, it accomplishes exactly what it needs to do in order to be effective. It is an important film, for despite its bleak tones, its message is clear: Get up, get angry, and get involved, because it’s not too late.

Nominated to the Supreme Court on July 9, Brett M. Kavanaugh has since become the focus of a national reckoning over sexual assault in the context of his confirmation hearings. As multiple allegations of sexual misconduct have emerged against Kavanaugh at the height of the #MeToo movement, the fight over his confirmation has devolved into partisan mudslinging.
Though Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court has stolen the headlines, it is not the only position he was slated to fill in the coming year. Kavanaugh is listed as a lecturer at Harvard Law School for the winter of 2019, where he has lectured since 2008. Since the emergence of allegations against Kavanaugh, the Law School has refused to say whether or not he will take up his post as a lecturer in the new year. Instead of refusing “to discuss personnel matters,” the response given by Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82, the University should consider carefully the costs of having an angry, partisan Supreme Court nominee who stands accused of sexual assault and potentially perjury teaching a class on the history of the Supreme Court since 2005.
Arguments against confirming Kavanaugh to the Court or allowing him back to Harvard on the basis of believing Dr. Ford and other accusers have already been made by Democrats on the national level and by law students writing in the Harvard Law Record. I strongly support these arguments, but both for Dean Manning and Senate Republicans like Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, they have not appeared to be enough. Manning refused to comment, and Corker announced his support for the nomination, saying, “While both individuals provided compelling testimony, nothing that has been presented corroborates the allegation.”
Flake, another swing vote during the confirmation process, referenced due process in his statement on the morning Kavanaugh was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying, “Our system of justice affords a presumption of innocence to the accused, absent corroborating evidence.” Though Flake later pushed for and received a one-week postponement of Kavanaugh’s full Senate vote pending a brief FBI investigation, this rationale remains should the investigation fail to sway his opinion. To those who want to justify support for Kavanaugh, this argument has the advantage of not negating the severity of sexual assault or rape.
However, this argument holds little merit. What’s at stake for Kavanaugh is not conviction of a criminal offense. It is whether or not he is promoted to a lifetime appointment on the foremost judicial body in the country. At the College, we know all too well the difficulties of being considered for jobs. Companies can and do search students’ social media profiles looking for information on what kind of people they might be outside of their professional context. When employers find images or other evidence that suggest anything other than the highest qualifications, we are not afforded the opportunity to defend or contextualize our actions. We are not told that because there is not enough proof to merit our conviction in a court of law, we will be given the benefit of the doubt. We are simply put in a reject pile and passed on for the next qualified applicant.
Similarly, when assessing Kavanaugh’s fitness to hold a position as a lecturer at HLS, questions about the credibility of the allegations are not the only worries for his appointment. Can a person whose behavior as a teen is front and center in the fight for the future of the court, and who was so visibly emotional, angry, and nakedly partisan during his confirmation hearings be expected to provide an impartial discussion for his students?
Even if the answer is no, it could be argued that, like at the Kennedy School, people whose teaching is not politically neutral play an important role in networking the school into the professional world. However, taking that line of argument at the Law School can and should open up HLS to the same kinds of political liabilities that the Institute of Politics and the Kennedy School face. When Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo refused to show up to a scheduled event because Chelsea Manning was also invited to the IOP, the IOP revoked Manning's offer. This decision had nothing to do with the educational merit of Manning’s appearance, or any judgment about her character, which had not changed between the time the invitation was issued and when it was revoked.
If that is the argument upon which the Law School bases a decision to keep Kavanaugh, should they elect to do so, then it is up to those who feel that Kavanaugh’s tenure at HLS is illegitimate to use similar tactics to ensure that he does not remain there. Both respect for the severity of issues of sexual assault and considerations of educational and political merit demand that Kavanaugh not be invited to return to the Law School. Similarly, the tradition of innocent until proven guilty does not excuse him from the dangers that job-seekers face in every other context. Unless enough evidence of currently prosecutable criminal wrongdoing to justify charges accrues against him, Kavanaugh should return to his seat on the D.C. Circuit, where he should stay.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past week, Harvard closed out a record-breaking campaign, raising $9.6 billion. The campaign is an extraordinary financial achievement and speaks to the phenomenal generosity and devotion of the Harvard network. We congratulate the Harvard administration on the achievement, and especially on the $1.3 billion raised specifically for financial aid.
Nevertheless, we urge the administration to practice fiscal caution with the funds that have been raised. Not only does Harvard face the first year of a new federal endowment tax on the income generated by the endowment, but the Democratic candidate for Massachusetts governor Jay Gonzalez is proposing a new tax on University endowments. Unlike the federal tax, this new proposal would tax the assets of Harvard’s endowment, costing the University over ten times as much.
Already, the federal tax will be a significant burden to the University endowment. Administrators estimated that in 2017, the tax would have cost the University $43 million. Administrators note that the tax limits the University’s programs to spend on important research, as well as financial aid programs that are integral to Harvard’s support of low-income students. If this tax is now Harvard’s reality, then Gonzalez’s plan is only more concerning. His plan would cost the University over $500 million.
It follows that Harvard must be incredibly thoughtful about how it spends and more importantly saves the funds it has acquired as a result of the capital campaign. Though current use giving — or donations that could be spent as soon as they came in — was an exciting part of the campaign, we believe that immediate usage of the funds may not be the best for the University’s financial health. Though Gonzalez’s election is unlikely against popular incumbent Republican Charlie D. Baker ’79, the University should be preparing itself for a scenario in which it faces both the current federal and the proposed state tax, which is notably supported by Cambridge Mayor Marc C. McGovern.
That being said, we are eager to see Harvard redouble its commitment to financial aid and the ongoing house renewal project. The $1.3 billion the University raised exclusively for financial aid is a remarkable accomplishment, and we hope the University continues to prioritize the program in its fundraising and expenditure. The program marks one of Harvard’s most critical contributions to higher education and society as a whole, and we hope the University continues to lead the way in supporting low-income college students.
Likewise, the house renewal project has been a critical part of improving undergraduate life, especially as the University seeks to limit the sway of unrecognized single-gender social organizations on undergraduate student life. We look forward to the completion of Lowell House and the commencement of work on Adams House thereafter.
All who gave to and worked on the capital campaign should be applauded for this financial achievement. However, the new federal endowment tax and the threat of an even more burdensome state one necessitate that the University proceed with fiscal caution.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2018, you’ll find a host of articles about all the things millennials have seem to killed: the diamond industry, home ownership, JonBenét Ramsey (well, maybe not the last one). Far more interesting than multi-billion dollar industries made obsolete are what we’ve given life to: avocado toast, fidget spinners, and “woke” culture!
What does it mean to be woke? Knowledge of social justice issues is so Civil Rights Era and (therefore) out of date. In the age of constant social media connection and instant gratification, we need excitement! Sustained community-based activism and political work just takes too long.  Tweeting about how I just bought a PRIDE t-shirt and “ended homophobia” inside Target only takes a few seconds. That, my friends, is woke culture in 2018: a performance in two parts — posting about social issues online and expectantly waiting for the affirmation to pour in.
To activate your woke starter kit, RSVP to a Facebook event. But you don’t actually have to go. It’s not even the thought that counts. What’s important is that other people see you had the seeming intention to go. However, if other people don’t like your RSVP to the Women’s March or environmental justice protest, you may as well cancel your intention to go anyway.
The whole “woke” concept started as a way for black people to remind one another of the importance of socio-political awareness as a means of survival. But much like everything else in the United States, it’s been co-opted by the larger culture for their own self-enjoyment and capitalist gain. In genesis of wokeness, crucial was the phrase “stay woke,” which emphasized that dismantling oppressive structures is a process that requires constant vigilance, un-learning, and re-learning. Yet, our culture has decided active, continual engagement with wokeness — like free healthcare and Applebee’s — isn’t all that important. Instead, we value the image of performance of social awareness.
Performing such awareness means signaling values, acting as if you’ve got to show that you have the social justice know-how — regardless of your actual advocacy or beliefs — in order to prove that you’re smart, cool, and if you’re “privileged,” one of the good ones. “She’s woke,” we might say to describe someone to signal that we approve of her and suggest our friends do the same.
Performative wokeness is drowning your lecture comments with a host of social justice buzzwords — try favorites like intersectionality, marginalized, discourse, subjectivity, or any -ism — without regard to whether other people understand you. Forget interrogating that you likely only have some of this knowledge thanks to your $65,000+ education, which many of the communities you claim to be speaking for could never access: This is your self-congratulatory stage!
All of this is not to critique the aforementioned social justice words or concepts themselves. The problem exists in how performative wokeness weaponizes them. Woke culture separates these ideas from the oppressions they give us frameworks for understanding and from the communities they seek to empower. Instead, critical concepts become tools for bolstering our own self-image and earning each others’ approval.
How do I know woke culture so well? I’ve spent my fair share of time in social justice spaces, surrounded by “leftist” kids with more virtue-signaling pins on their backpacks than minutes dedicated to community service. I’ve read treatises on white privilege by folks who cross the street when they see a black person.
What really made me question the authenticity of some woke-card carriers was the repeated explanation of my own experiences for the sake of proving how “down” they are. Their eyes doggedly search my black-womanly face for any scraps of woke-brownie points they can get. You don’t have to explain racism to me. I’m glad you’ve seen “13th” and have read bell hooks and attended a Black Lives Matter rally. Sometimes I want to talk about whether Kim Kardashian’s braids look good or not without having a white girl explain cultural appropriation to me.
But how do I really know woke culture? Because I’m part of it too. I spend more time reading anti-capitalist Tumblr posts than I do community organizing. I’ve taken pictures at a protest and posted them on Instagram. Heck, I’ve written a multi-paragraph Facebook polemic (or 12).
That’s how I know the wanna-be-woke among us don’t always have bad intentions. Sometimes posting on the Internet or wearing that strongly-worded t-shirt feel easier than trying to fix a world that feels engulfed in an indomitable, metaphorical-sociopolitical fire. And the truth of the matter is that activism and social change don’t always feel glamorous.
So I’m not saying we should never wear feminist t-shirts again or that there’s no value to talking about social justice online. One could argue such efforts, particularly online discussions, which offer knowledge and information to people who otherwise lack access to them, are crucial to consciousness raising. However, I do contend that it’s worth questioning why and how we and those we encounter are (seemingly) advancing the causes they do.
If woke culture presents another oppressive force we need to combat, how do we join the #resistance? I guess we could go outside and canvass for the November midterm elections. Vote when the time comes. Tutor kids after school. Join a mentoring program. Volunteer with a hunger relief organization, animal hospital, or homeless shelter. There are a number of activist or volunteer efforts you and I could help advance in a world of seemingly endless need.
But what if no one’s around to see what we’re doing? If a tree falls in the forest, and it doesn’t make a sound, is it really woke?
We may not save the world from global mass extinction in 2100, but at least we felt good about ourselves for barely trying. And looked good online doing it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Professors, formerly incarcerated individuals, lawyers, and students crowded together in the Barker Center for several hours Friday afternoon for “Belonging: The Challenges of Reentry,” a conference dedicated to discussing the experiences of individuals who reenter society after serving time in prison.
Three members of the Philosophy Department — Ph.D. candidatese Darien Pollock and Diana Acosta Navas and Bréond Durr, Ph.D. candidate in African and African American Studies — worked together to organize the conference. The Hutchins Center for African and African American Research, the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, and the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History also sponsored the event.
Pollock, one of the conference’s co-organizers, cited the “need to tell a nuanced aspect of the phenomenon of mass incarceration” as one of the reasons to hold the gathering. Pollock said that, while American society and academics sometimes openly discuss sentencing and prison experience, he hears much less conversation about reentry.
University Professor Danielle S. Allen, who gave opening remarks at the conference, said it is vital to canvass the topic of reentry in order to accomplish criminal justice reform.
“The worse the experience [in prison], the less likely the prospect of reentry,” Allen said. “So, at the end of the day, the sentencing conversation and the re-entry conversation are the same conversations.”
The conference comprised two panels, both of which featured speakers who had served time in prison as well as a number of professors. Pollock said the organizers wanted to hear both from former prisoners who had directly experienced reentry and from academics who are addressing incarceration and similar themes in their research.
Panelist Imani Perry, a professor of African American studies at Princeton University, spoke about the economic and social difficulties individuals face when reintegrating into society. She said it can be especially hard to find a job.
“The structure that exists is one that is deliberately exclusive, it’s exclusionary,” Perry said. “The problem of reentry so often is constructed as a problem of the deficiency of those who are reentering, when in fact is is a structural deficiency.”
Panelist Angel Sanchez said he agreed with Perry. Sanchez said he “grew up in Florida’s prison system” after being tried and convicted as an adult at age 14 for attempted murder and armed robbery in gang-related activity. Sanchez, now a law student at the University of Miami, said the road from prison to law school was nearly impossible to traverse.
“I was 28 when I got out of prison, going on 17 emotionally,” Sanchez said in an interview with The Crimson after the panel discussion.
Sanchez said formerly incarcerated individuals face a challenging decision upon reentering society: whether to return home or to try to begin anew elsewhere.
“When I got out, I knew that I couldn’t go back to the same people, places and things, but I didn’t have anywhere else to go,” Sanchez said. “[We] have to choose between going back to a bad environment or having no environment to go to, so the answer is obviously easy. Go back to the bad environment.”
Sanchez chose to start fresh. From a homeless shelter in Orlando, he made his way to community college, where he earned a 4.0 GPA. His prior conviction, though, followed him to college, where he was removed from the honor society when other members learned of his felony. After being rejected by 21 out of 23 law programs to which he applied, Sanchez enrolled at the law school at the University of Miami and has since served as a judicial intern.
“I literally went from a defendant in that courtroom to a judicial intern walking in to that courtroom. When they said all rise, I was next to the judge in her robe, myself in a suit in a courtroom where I once had to walk in with an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs,” he said.
Pollock, who gained inspiration for the conference from the experiences of his uncle who served time in prison, said he thought the conference was successful and went “better than [he] hoped.”
“I think this conference was really what it said on the flier. It was a belonging type of conference,” Pollock said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sporting homemade T-shirts and pushing strollers, over 2,500 people took to the streets of Brighton this weekend for the Samaritans 20th Annual 5K for Suicide Prevention, jogging along the Charles for three miles in order to raise awareness and funds for those at risk of suicide.
Running among the crowd were roughly 20 Harvard undergraduates. They were there for Alexander H. Patel ’17-’18.
Patel, a Harvard undergraduate, died by suicide during his senior year last October, aged 22. Remembered by peers and faculty as not only a brilliant student of Philosophy and Mathematics but also an “incredible friend,” he spent his time at the College as a Computer Science teaching fellow and a research assistant to Computer Science Professor Margo I. Seltzer ’83. In April, the College launched a fund in memory of Patel to support a new group of student teaching fellows in the Computer Science department.
Patel’s sister, Jacqueline P. Patel ’21, said she organized a team of students to run the 5K in advance of the anniversary of her brother’s death. She described the team — comprising friends and blockmates — as a network of personal supporters.
“My team is basically composed of people who have been really supportive of me in the past year and are the reason why I was able to make it through this year,” Jacqueline said.
The group joined 157 other teams running the 5K, many formed in honor of loved ones lost to suicide. Every detail of the Patel team’s preparations was meant to memorialize Alex — even down to the email lists the team contacted with fundraising messages, Jacqueline said. The team solicited donations from groups that she, Alex, and their brother Dev A. Patel ’16 were involved in at the College — namely, their Houses, Quincy and Adams, and The Crimson, where all three siblings formerly served as News editors.
Alex reported on Harvard Business School for The Crimson and did work for the paper's data analysis team, at one point winning a national award for a data-based article on faculty political donations.
“I was really trying to not just raise money from random people, but raise money from people who knew Alex to kind of keep the message of this alive, that this is not just raising money for the sake of raising money but raising money to honor Alex,” Jacqueline said.
By Saturday morning, the team had raised over $1,600 to help fund crisis hotlines, community outreach, and grief support groups organized by Samaritans, a nonprofit dedicated to reducing suicide risk.
Jacqueline said she believes the fundraiser was a great way to keep her brother’s memory alive.
“After you have a memorial service, there’s not many things you can do to remember the person you lost,” Jacqueline said. “This is a cool way where I still get to remember Alex, but also raise money for a really good cause and bring my friends together to remember my brother at a time of year that’s super difficult for me and my family.”
The mood of the 5K, held on a cloudless late-summer morning, was more festival than memorial, with raffles, food trucks, and a tie-dye tent set up at the starting line. During registration, the sounds of Beyoncé and Katy Perry filtered over loudspeakers and the mascot of the Boston Red Sox weaved through the crowd giving high-fives.
When the time came to start the race, participants ranging in age from toddlers to retirees took their marks behind a 20-foot arch of green and white balloons, many with dogs and strollers in tow. Friends and family lined up to cheer along the route, many wearing colorful homemade T-shirts bearing the names and photographs of lost loved ones.
Byron S. Hurlbut ’21 said the team of undergrads “were not running the race to win.”
“We all finished the 5K, which was good,” Hurlbut said. “I think it was just an amazing show of solidarity from us, but also to see so many people at the Samaritans race, all of whom have been directly affected by suicide, and to know that support network exists, and to see how much people care about this issue.”
Jacqueline said the fundraiser could potentially become an annual tradition.
“Definitely I’m super interested in repeating this, but I’m really just kind of looking at this year and looking at this race, and doing it with my friends, and taking it just one step at a time,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s undergraduate dining halls will now open 30 minutes earlier for lunch on weekdays to accommodate the new academic schedule adopted by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Each of the dining halls in the 12 upperclassmen residential Houses and the first-year dining hall, Annenberg, will open at 11:30 a.m. instead of 12 p.m. effective Thursday, according to Harvard University Dining Services.
“HUDS recognized that the new class schedule, including a noontime class, was making it challenging for some students to have lunch in the dining hall,” Harvard University Dining Services spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an email. “As such, HUDS adjusted our lunchtime opening hours by 30 minutes.”
Upperclassmen will still have the option to grab food through Fly-By, a weekday bagged lunch service, from 11:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m.and all undergraduates may continue to order bagged meals before 4 a.m. for same-day pickup, Martin added.
Michael S. Uy, the Dunster House resident dean, informed Dunster residents of the change via email Thursday.
“We've heard from many of you that if you have classes scheduled 12-2.45pm, then you are hard pressed to eat lunch,” he wrote. “So we've listened, and HUDS has now extended its hours (effective today) so that lunch will be served beginning at 11.30am.”
Under the new scheduling rules, many seminars are scheduled to meet from 12 to 2:45 p.m., overlapping entirely with the previous lunch slot. By opening the dining halls earliers, HUDS hopes students who must attend class during that time will still be able to eat lunch, according to Martin.
Alexandra N. Ratzker ’19, who is enrolled in a seminar that meets from 12 noon to 2:45 p.m. on Wednesdays, said she was pleased by change.
“I think that opening the dining halls a half an hour early to accommodate students who have class from 12-2:45 p.m. is certainly helpful,” Ratzker said. “I personally will likely go to the dining hall at 11:30 a.m.”
But she added that, going forward, she believes 165-minute classes such as her seminar should not meet midday.
“I think that, for future semesters, the schedule should be altered so that classes of that length don’t meet during that block,” Ratzker said.
Upperclassmen dining halls and Annenberg Hall, the freshman dining hall, close for lunch at 2:15 p.m. Cabot, Currier, and Pforzheimer House dining halls close at 2:30 p.m.

Following at least four years of budget deficits, The Faculty of Arts and Sciences ended fiscal year 2018 with a $3.1 million surplus, according to the Dean’s annual report.
Faculty members will discuss the report, as well as a proposed change to the wording of the College’s foreign language requirement, at their monthly meeting Tuesday, the first of the semester.
FAS Dean Claudine Gay will present the annual report — her first presentation since taking office in July following former Dean of FAS Michael D. Smith's retirement — according to the meeting agenda. This will also be the first Faculty meeting for newly minted University President Lawrence S. Bacow.
The report summarizes FAS’s financials from fiscal year 2018, which ended June 30. The $3.1 million surplus marks a significant improvement from the $11.7 million deficit FAS saw in fiscal year 2017. This is the first time the school has achieved a surplus in several years as it struggled to recover from the 2008 financial crisis.
The report also highlights that FAS raised a total of $3.28 billion during the University’s recently concluded Capital Campaign, far surpassing its initial goal of $2.5 billion.
Key expenses over the past year have included Harvard Financial Aid, a new initiative started by Smith in fall 2017 to fund faculty projects, and infrastructure expenses — including the House Renewal project, per the report.
Gay’s report also introduces the Quantitative Biology Initiative, which launched this past spring, and comprises research grants and training meant to facilitate collaboration between scholars in biology and quantitative fields.
The report further highlights faculty hiring trends, including an increase in the percentage of women in the ladder faculty — meaning tenured and tenure track professors — from 25 percent to 31 percent and an increase in the percentage of minorities in the ladder faculty from 17 percent to 23 percent under Smith’s 11-year deanship.
Also at Tuesday's meeting, Jay M. Harris, former Dean of Undergraduate Education, will propose a change to the Handbook for Students which would alter the wording of the current foreign language requirement to be a “language other than English” and eliminate the “written component” portion of the requirement.
"The language requirement demands rigorous study but does not require a particular format of study or examination. Students should be taught in all forms of a language that are customary in the practice of that language today," the proposed wording states.
The new wording stems from a report authored by a subcommittee convened in spring 2018 to review the language requirement. The elimination of a written component would allow students to use American Sign Language to fulfill the requirement.
“The subcommittee recommends that the study of sign languages of Deaf communities such as American Sign Language (ASL) be permitted to fulfill the language requirement,” the report reads. “[ASL] is not the English language in another form, but is instead a language with its own cultural and linguistic integrity, unrelated in structure to spoken English.”
Ever since Harvard first began offering ASL classes two years ago, activists have urged the College to allow students to fulfill their requirements using the language.
The proposal would also allow students more flexibility in completing the foreign language requirement generally.
One proposed change would allow students who fail to place out of the requirement using Harvard placement test scores to retake the placement exam after their first semester of language study. Another proposed change would allow the Office of Undergraduate Education to seek qualified examiners at other institutions if a student wished to take a placement exam in a language not offered at Harvard.
The Faculty Council has already discussed and voted to approve the new wording at its most recent meeting. Though the Council will announce its support for Harris’s proposal, their vote is purely advisory.
Because the change in wording would be substantial, the Faculty will only discuss the proposed change Tuesday and will be able to vote on the proposal at their next meeting in November.

U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled Friday that the admissions lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants must go to trial in October, thwarting once and for all months-long campaigns waged by the University and plaintiff Students for Fair Admissions to convince her to decide the matter without a courtroom fight.
Both Harvard and SFFA, an anti-affirmative action advocacy group, spent much of the summer arguing she should resolve the suit by summary judgment — that is, sans a trial.
In a Friday court order, Burroughs disappointed both parties, determining that the suit will go to trial as scheduled at a federal courthouse in Boston on Oct. 15. Many legal experts previously predicted she would do so.
Burroughs ruled she must be able to consider evidence presented at a full trial in order to adjudicate the dispute, which will not involve a jury.
“Whether SFFA may prove its intentional discrimination claim requires a close review of the conflicting expert testimony, the available documents, and the testimony of the Admissions Office employees in the context of a trial,” Burroughs wrote in a Friday court order.
Burroughs also wrote that Harvard and SFFA’s conflicting testimony and data analyses — much of which became public via court filings in June — left open the question of whether Harvard uses “racial balancing” to artificially determine the demographic breakdown of each incoming class, as SFFA alleges it does.
“SFFA and Harvard again present plausible but conflicting interpretations of the admissions data and testimonial evidence concerning whether Harvard uses a quota system,” Burroughs wrote.
SFFA brought the lawsuit against the College in 2014, alleging its admissions office illegally discriminates against Asian-American applicants to the school. Harvard has vehemently and repeatedly denied the charges.
Thousands of pages of internal Harvard admissions data — ranging from administrators’ emails to guidelines for scoring high schoolers' applications — became public via court filings over the summer. SFFA’s lawyers based many of their arguments for summary judgment on these documents, which in some cases detailed previously confidential components of Harvard's notoriously secretive admissions process.
A few of those filings revealed the existence of a 2013 internal review conducted by the University's research arm that concluded the College's admissions system produces “negative effects” for Asian Americans. The confidential report found that admissions officers gave Asian-American applicants lower scores for their personal traits such as “humor” and “grit.”
The report was circulated among top administrators at the time but Harvard officials did not take serious action to address the study's findings. Top University administrators argued in court filings over the summer that that report was “incomplete,” based on limited data, and never meant to definitively evaluate whether Harvard discriminates in its admissions process.
As the University girds for a high-profile and high-stakes trial in 15 days, it also faces an ongoing United States Department of Justice investigation into allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants.
The Justice Department opened a parallel probe into Yale’s admissions process over near-identical allegations in April.

President of Ecuador Lenín Moreno spoke about his country’s politics and the fight to end corruption at the Harvard Kennedy School’s John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Friday.
Moreno was joined by his wife, Rocio Gonzalez Navas; Jacqueline Brigida Astudillo, the Ecuadorian ambassador to the United States; and a delegation from Ecuador. It was Moreno’s first visit to Harvard since he was elected president of Ecuador in 2017.
“It is the first time that I came to Boston and this prestigious university,”  Moreno said in his speech, which he gave in Spanish. “Ecuador is a small country, but it is enriched by its culture.”
The faculty director of the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies Brian D. Farrell introduced Moreno as one of the world's leading advoates for rights for disabled individuals. Moreno was shot in 1998 and has used a wheelchair ever since. He is the world’s only currently serving head of state who uses a wheelchair.
In 2012, Moreno was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for his advocacy on behalf of the disabled.
“President Moreno’s passion is the advocacy of the awareness and rights of disabled people, where he is a recognized global eminence,” Farrell said.
Moreno spoke about corruption in Latin America — an issue that has recently focused an international spotlight on Ecuador.
In July, it was reported that an Ecuadorian judge had released an arrest warrant for former President Rafael Correa for helping kidnap one of his political opponents. Moreno served as Correa’s vice president from 2007 to 2013.
Moreno warned that even leaders with “good hearts” can fail to resist the pull of absolute power.
“The moment that you feel absolute power, you fall in love with it completely, and you cannot stop it. This is why corruption is still around,” Moreno said to the large crowd of Harvard affiliates and visitors.
Since his election, Moreno has distanced himself from former president Correa, introducing policies meant to protect freedom of expression in Ecuador and allowing private banks to work independently of the central bank in certain cases.
“We must hear the opinions of the other side to advance our country,” Moreno said.
Andres G. Sierra, a Masters in Public Administration student at the Kennedy School who attended the speech, said it is important to hear from presidents like Moreno who came from “developing countries.”
“The fact that President Moreno came to Harvard is a very important opportunity to open parts of cooperation between the government of Ecuador and Harvard,” Sierra said.
“It is always hard to have a president here in the Forum, especially when he comes from a developing country — from a country where not many young people have studied at Harvard. So, it’s an amazing opportunity,” Sierra added.
Moreno’s visit to the Forum comes a day after President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama spoke at the Forum and visited with University President Lawrence S. Bacow.

More than 700 Harvard students and affiliates have signed a petition calling for the Harvard-Yale tailgate to be held in the athletics complex in the hours before The Game on Nov. 17, and not in a proposed space near Fenway Park.
When played in Cambridge, the annual football game has historically taken place in Harvard Stadium on the Boston side of the Charles River. In a break with tradition, however, the 135th Game between the Ivy League rivals will be played at Fenway Park in Boston due to ongoing restoration work on the more-than-century-old football stadium.
The “Save the Game 2018” petition calls on the Athletics Department to “not wholly relocate” the Harvard-Yale pregame celebrations to Fenway Park. Instead, the letter urges the department to preserve “an inclusive atmosphere of enthusiastic school spirit with student tailgates” by holding the tailgate at the athletic complex in Allston.
Christopher P. Ulian ’19, one of the authors of the petition, said he wanted to make sure administrators were aware of some students' displeasure over the suggested changes to Harvard-Yale this year. He said he and others met with staff members from the Athletics Department and the Dean of Students Office to discuss the situation prior to creating and circulating the petition.
“Harvard Yale is one of the most important events of the year for undergraduates at Harvard, so we wanted to make sure undergraduate voices were being heard,” Ulian wrote in an email Sunday.
The Athletic Department’s website states that Harvard plans to set up a "FanZone" near Fenway Park that will be open to the public and will include a space where guests can purchase food and beverages. In an interview last fall, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise said the Athletics Department is hoping to increase attendance at The Game by holding tailgates near Fenway Park.
The petition warns that many students will instead choose to stay on campus or attend pregame festivities in small and “often exclusive” dorms and social clubs around campus, thereby decreasing overall undergraduate turnout for the Game.
The petition also says the proposed FanZone will “severely limit” the “socioeconomic accessibility” of the game because of the “expensive food and beverages” that will become students’ only option for snacks and refreshments at Fenway.
“As the College seeks to increase accessible social spaces and emphasize inclusivity, it seems like the Harvard-Yale tailgate represents an opportunity to demonstrate the administration’s commitment to that vision,” Ulian wrote.
Madison C. Thompson ’20 said she signed the petition because she said she wanted to preserve “one of the few days a year where people really buy into school spirit.”
Thompson said moving the pregame celebrations to Fenway would be “a deterring factor” for students who are unsure of attending.
“I personally wouldn't be too thrilled about trying to figure out my way through Fenway Park,” Thompson said. “I don't even know the streets around there; Boston is just confusing."
In an emailed statement Sunday, Scalise wrote that the Athletics Department will announce details for pregame activities “soon” after coordinating with the College’s Dean of Students Office.
The College’s Dean of Students Office is currently in the process of hiring a graduate student to plan a campus-based “watch party” for undergraduates who choose not to make the trek from Harvard to Fenway Park, according to a job posting on the Student Employment Office database.
“As always, our goal is for students, alumni and fans to have a fun and safe experience,” Scalise wrote. “We are working closely with the Dean of Students Office to determine the feasibility of an on-campus event for students to gather and socialize together before the game, and we hope to have details to announce soon.”
Some students are less than impressed with administrative efforts so far.
“There's been so much changing this school year with getting rid of Harvard Time, the new schedule, everything like that, it just seems like they are kind of uprooting a lot of things that Harvard students have really enjoyed and it seems asinine in my opinion," Thompson added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The summer renovation of Massachusetts Hall — which prevented University President Lawrence S. Bacow from immediately taking his rightful seat behind the large desk in the corner office in the small brick building that has long served as the ancestral workspace of Harvard presidents — is almost complete.
The construction, which was slated to conclude during the summer of 2018, wound up continuing well into September. According to University spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke, the renovation did not affect the move-in of the 13 members of the Class of 2022 who were assigned to live there during their freshman years.
“The students moved back on time, as scheduled, on Monday, August 27,” O'Rourke wrote in an emailed statement.
Nevertheless, the construction did not go unnoticed by the first-year residents.
“It has its benefits and its drawbacks,” resident Selorm M. Quarshie ’22 said. “Drawback would be at like, 6 a.m., and you wanted to sleep in, but they’re using a ripsaw,” he said. “Advantage would be, it’s like 9 a.m. and you missed your alarm, and you have a 10:30 class, and it actually worked out well.”
Nicole Zhang '22 said the fire alarm sounded "several times" during the renovation process.
“So that was definitely part of an inconvenient thing that would happen,” Zhang said. “It’d be really loud, and you wouldn’t know if you should leave the building or not, because you know it’s just because of the construction,” she added.
Other residents said the noise and commotion has not bothered them.
“I’d say it hasn’t really impacted my experience so far other than the fact that some of the dorm amenities weren’t implemented yet, so I had my light switches installed like two weeks ago,” Mikki A. Thompson ’22 said. “But other than that, they were good about not making noise.”
In addition to serving as a dormitory for freshman students, Massachusetts Hall is home to the offices of the President, Provost, and several other high-profile Harvard administrators. While Bacow and the Provost have now begun working in the building again, other officials who work in the Hall will keep moving back in throughout October, according to O’Rourke.
The renovation was meant to restore the building’s Georgian exterior — workers refurbished the Hall's masonry, roofing, gutters, and the clock face on its west facade. Some improvements were internal, though; construction workers also installed a new central heating and air conditining system and made “significant code and life safety upgrades.”
Built in 1720, Massachusetts Hall has played myriad roles in both the history of the University and the nation. The building accommodated hundreds of American soldiers during the Revolutionary War. As a dormitory, it housed historical figures such as John Adams and John Hancock.
Because of the historical significance of the building, any alteration to the Hall must be approved by the Cambridge Historical Commission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the showdown over Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh’s confirmation continues to grip the country, Harvard Law School students are not letting up in their efforts to prevent Kavanaugh — who teaches at the school — from reaching the nation’s highest court.
The Pipeline Parity Project — a Law School student advocacy group — and the Law School Democrats have organized phone banks in concert with Planned Parenthood this week to rally voters in key states to call their senators and tell them to vote no on Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
Their entreaties follow a dramatic Senate hearing in Washington, D.C. last week in which Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford elaborated in vivid detail on her allegations that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when the two were teenagers in suburban Maryland in the 1980s. Ford is one of at least two women who have publicly accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault in recent weeks, roiling a confirmation process that once seemed straightforward.
Ford first came forward with her allegations in an interview with the Washington Post, alleging that Kavanaugh pushed her onto a bed, attempted to remove her clothes, pressed his body onto hers, and covered her mouth when she tried to yell for help while at a party in high school. Ford repeated these allegations — tearfully asserting that she believed at the time Kavanaugh was going to rape her — when she testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Following Ford’s interview with the Post, a former classmate of Kavanaugh’s at Yale, Deborah Ramirez, came forward with her own allegations of sexual assault. Ramirez told the New Yorker that Kavanaugh exposed himself and pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended while freshmen at Yale.
Kavanaugh has “categorically and unequivocally” denied the allegations levied against him, and he forcefully repeated those denials at Thursday’s hearing.
The Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court around 1:45 p.m. Friday — less than 24 hours after Ford and Kavanaugh testified. But in a surprising turn of events, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) called for a one-week delay of the full Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination until an FBI investigation “limited in time and scope” is completed.
Kavanaugh — who has taught at the Law School as a visiting lecturer since 2008 — is scheduled to teach his course “The Supreme Court Since 2005” in Jan. 2019. Since Ford stepped forward last month, Law students have penned an op-ed and held protests calling on the school to bar the judge from teaching pending a school investigation into the allegations.
Law School administrators have repeatedly declined to comment on the future of Kavanaugh’s position at the school, citing school policy not to comment on “personnel matters.”
Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 had not commented publicly on Kavanaugh until late last week. After receiving a flood of emails from concerned students, Manning sent a missive to the student body Friday seeking to account for his silence.
In his email, he wrote that, though he knows many students are “unsatisfied with the answer that we cannot comment on personnel matters in particular cases… the policy serves important purposes even in stressful times.”
“Still, I can provide you this assurance:  When concerns and allegations arise about individuals in our teaching program, we take those concerns and allegations seriously, conduct necessary inquiries, complete our process, and then act,” he added.
Asked whether the school is investigating Kavanaugh, Law School spokesperson Robb London again declined to comment.
In addition to campus activism aimed at preventing Kavanaugh from returning to Cambridge, Law School students involved in the phone bank are hoping to change minds further from home.
The students are specifically concentrating their efforts on several states whose senators will cast critical votes to determine Kavanaugh’s fate: North Dakota, West Virginia, and Arizona.
Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Ala.), Joe Manchin (D-W. Va.), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) — all considered swing votes — supported the delay and investigation Flake set in motion Friday. Phone bankers hope to persuade voters to encourage the senators to go a step further and vote down Kavanaugh’s confirmation. The groups have held two sessions at the Law School and made over 1,000 calls thus far, they said. They plan to hold two more phone banks over the coming week.
Second-year Law student Emma R. Janger, a member of the Pipeline Parity Project and one of the organizers of the phone banks, said the phone banks offers students a way to translate their frustration into action.
“People are really, really energized and they really want to push their senators on this and that’s been just honestly, really energizing to hear,” Janger said. “I think sometimes this has kind of felt like a pretty hopeless week but talking to people who are in a position to really affect their senators’ votes and hearing how energized they are is giving me personally a lot of hope.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted Sunday to approve its annual budget, okaying substantial increases in funding for nearly all Council operations including grants to student groups.
The $650,000 budget — which will likely be given the final nod by administrators in the coming days — will provide the Council with a roughly 34 percent increase in revenue from last year, according to an outline of the budget.
This year is the first in which the Council had to apply to a new student-faculty board to receive its funding allocations. The College announced in April that it would increase the student activities fee — an optional sum undergraduates pay as part of their enrollment costs — from $75 to $200, and that it would make accompanying changes to the way the UC, House Committees, College Events Board, and Intramural Council receive funds.
As part of those changes, the House Committees — which used to receive nearly $160,000 from the Council — now apply directly to the funding board for money. Even with that significant line item removed from its budget, the UC nonetheless requested slightly more funding than last year.
The Council’s Finance Committee, which faced a budget shortfall for much of last year, will receive $345,000 in funding, up from $295,000 last year, a welcome development for UC leaders who said in the spring they were optimistic that the changes to the activities fee would improve their ability to meet grant requests.
During the debate over the budget, Council members presented multiple amendments in order to ensure that the Finance Committee would not be forced to make large across-the-board cuts to grants or tap into the UC’s Emergency Fund, as it had to do last year.
One ultimately successful amendment, proposed by new finance committee chair Gevin B. Reynolds ’19, called for the Council to re-allocate $25,000 of the proposed increase in the UC’s burst fund to the committee instead.
UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, who wrote the budget and presented it to the funding board last Thursday, said the substantial increase in grant requests last year necessitated a boost in funding to the finance committee.
“Applications have skyrocketed over the past year alone,” Khoury said. “We have huge demand for student groups all over the campus.”
“And it’s amazing because people know what the UC is doing and want to be involved,” she added.
The Phillips Brooks House Association will also gain from the Council’s revenue increase, with annual UC allocations to the service organization rising from $30,000 to $35,000.
Sunday’s general meeting was the first of the Council’s term this semester. Toughly two dozen new representatives recently joined the body after nearly half of members elected in the spring graduated, resigned, or lost their seats in elections over the past few months.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's Undergraduate Council voted Sunday night to demand the University investigate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh sexually assaulted several women before allowing the judge to return to lecture at the Law School this winter.
President Donald Trump in July nominated Kavanaugh, who currently serves as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to fill the vacant seat left by Associate Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. At first, the Yale Law School graduate's confirmation seemed secure — but that was before multiple women stepped forward with accusations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted them, throwing the nomination process into disarray and riveting a divided nation.
One accuser, Palo Alto psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her at a house party held in the 1980s, when the two were both enrolled in D.C.-area high schools. Another woman, Deborah Ramirez, has alleged that Kavanaugh pushed his penis in her face at a party both attended during their undergraduate years at Yale. A third woman — Julie Swetnick, a client of prominent lawyer Michael Avenatti — issued a sworn statement indicating she saw Kavanaugh engage in “inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women during the early 1980s."
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegations against him, casting them as politically motivated in indignant and fiery testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh, who has lectured at the Law School for a decade, is slated to teach a course titled “The Supreme Court since 2005” during the winter 2019 term.  The Council's vote Sunday comes on the heels of several days of heated protests at the Law School, where some students are calling on the school to bar Kavanaugh from returning to Cambridge to teach pending a probe into the allegations.
The UC voted to publish a letter on behalf of the body demanding that Harvard investigate the nominee at its Sunday meeting, held in the brand-new Smith Campus Center. Twenty-five representatives voted in favor of the measure, which was sponsored by Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury '20, Secretary Rainbow Yeung '20, and newly elected representative Grey Johnson '22. Thirteen voted against it.
“The Undergraduate Council stands in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, and all survivors of sexual violence,” the letter reads. “We also stand with members of Harvard Law School who request a full and fair investigation into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh before he is allowed back on campus to teach.”
Law School spokespeople could not be reached for comment late Sunday.
In her Thursday testimony, Ford said she had received “constant harassment and death threats” since going public with her allegations.
The Council condemned attempts to silence sexual assault victims in its letter, writing that the threats Ford has endured indicate a need for students to “come together” to oppose all forms of sexual misconduct — and to oppose any and all attempts to cover up assault allegations.
“Repeated attempts to silence survivors like Dr. Ford cast into doubt time and time again the reliability of institutions that are meant to uphold justice and our civil rights as students,” the letter states. “At times like these, when survivors’ stories are called into question, we must come together to build collective power and hold our university accountable for supporting survivors, sanctioning perpetrators, and fighting the culture of sexual harassment.”
The Council argued in its letter that an “institutional failure” on the part of the University to combat sexual assault has bred a “ sense of mistrust” among students. The letter specifically mentions sexual harassment allegations made against Government Professor Jorge I. Dominguez last semester. Dominguez remained a Harvard faculty member for decades — and rose through the ranks to ever-higher positions of power — even after multiple women publicly accused him of harassment in the 1980s, prompting the University to sanction him at the time.
The allegations against Dominguez (and his punishment in the eighties) remained largely forgotten until the Chronicle of Higher Education reported in early 2018 that at least 18 women were accusing the professor of repeated acts of sexual harassment across the past three decades. In the wake of the Chronicle's report, Harvard placed Dominguez on paid "administrative leave" and Dominguez said he was retiring.
“Much like on the national stage, the problem of sexual violence at Harvard is complicated by structures of power, as we saw when the Chronicle of Higher Education published an article exposing decades of sexual harassment on the part of Jorge Dominguez at Harvard and institutional failure to address it,” the Council wrote in the letter.
“Less than half of female undergraduates and even fewer trans or gender-nonconforming students at Harvard think that campus officials would take a sexual violence report seriously,” the letter continues in reference to the results of a 2015 campus climate survey conducted by the Association of American Universities.
Former University President Drew. G Faust said at a faculty meeting after the Dominguez allegations came to light that the University “very clearly” had to do more to support assault victims.
“We need to acknowledge and work to address the cultural and structural realities that permit sexual harassment to occur,” Faust said. “All of us in this room share a responsibility to act in ways that acknowledge this imbalance of power.”
Some Council members debated the merits of the letter at Sunday's meeting. Oak Yard Representative A. Blake Barclay ’22 said he is concerned by parts of the statement, arguing that the Council should not “politicize” sexual assault prevention.
“I think it would make some students who might not share the same political views as the people who wrote the statement feel isolated and uncomfortable,” he said. “Sexual assault reform shouldn’t have to be political, but when we make explicit attacks on prominent members of political parties, it just divides us and that’s unnecessary to addressing these issues.”
Lowell House Representative Julia M. Huesa ’20 disagreed with Barclay, countering that sexual assault is always a touchy subject, but that campus leaders must still work to address it because the issue directly impacts many Harvard students.
“The personal is often political, and a lot of these things that happen on the national stage actually affect people’s lives on like a personal level,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the midst of perhaps the best stretch of his football career, Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 has been lighting up the NFL. In the first three games of the season, he put up 1,230 yards, 13 touchdown passes, and only four interceptions. (In week four, his hot streak wore off as he only completed 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception, leading the Bucs to sub in Jameis Winston for the second half.) Even though Fitzpatrick has been carrying the Harvard football mantle, there are eight more Harvard players currently on NFL rosters or practice squads, making Harvard the FCS school with the most active NFL players (Delaware, Illinois State, James Madison, and North Dakota State tie for second in this category with six players apiece). Playing alongside Fitzpatrick is Buccaneers tight end Cameron Brate ’14.  Brate struggled in the first two games of the season but came out strong in week three, connecting with Ryan Fitzpatrick for an all-Harvard touchdown.
Outside of Tampa, Harvard tight ends have also found NFL homes.  Ben Braunecker ’16 earned a roster spot with the Chicago Bears, marking his third season with the team, and Anthony Firkser ’17 will be playing for the Tennessee Titans. Fullback Kyle Juszczyk ’13 of the San Francisco 49ers and long snapper Tyler Ott ’14 of the Seattle Seahawks also played tight end at Harvard but have since converted to different positions in the NFL, although Ott also appeared as a long snapper with the Crimson. In the last two seasons, Juszczyk has made a name for himself with consecutive Pro Bowl appearances. To start off the 2018 campaign, he continued his dynamic play with a 56-yard reception to complement his blocking prowess.
The last three active Crimson NFL players, Nick Easton ’15, Adam Redmond ’16, and Cole Toner ’16, play on the offensive line for the Minnesota Vikings, Dallas Cowboys, and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively. Easton had established himself as a starter for the Vikings but unfortunately suffered a neck injury before the start of the season, landing him on injured reserve. Interestingly, no Harvard alumni play defense, and outside of Fitzpatrick at quarterback, the other eight players occupy blocking-heavy positions.

Not once this season has a Harvard field hockey opponent scored at the team’s home turf, Berylson Field. That didn’t change this weekend, as the hosts downed Bryant, 2-0, in front of a friendly crowd following a 2-1 victory at Penn the day before.
On the heels of the best 10-game start in program history, the No. 12 Division I program racked up its fifth and sixth straight wins over the weekend.
HARVARD 2, BRYANT 0
The Crimson (9-1, 2-0 Ivy) traveled back home for a game against Bryant (2-9) on Sunday. In spite of the limited rest, Harvard had a strong all-around performance against Bryant and came away with a shutout win, its fifth of the fall. On an assist from junior midfielder Casey Allen and senior midfielder Emily Duarte, senior back Olivia Allin scored her first goal of the weekend 19 minutes into the game.
The team tallied another point in the second half, this time on an unassisted goal from freshman forward Rachel Greenwood over the goalie pad. As usual, the Crimson played excellent defense, holding Bryant to zero shots, and complemented their defense with 31 shots on offense —16 of which were on goal — cutting out a large chunk of work for Bulldogs goalie Marjin Jaarsma.
“Our defense was solid today, we kept them to zero shots on goal,” senior midfielder Victoria Boylett said. “We were able to use the width to get some good passing patterns moving forward.”
The win was also somewhat symbolic and uplifting for the team, given the hectic schedule.
“We had to show that we can step up, that we’re a top team, even if we’re tired, even if it’s not an Ivy League game, and we did just that,” Allin said. “We have a lot of talent, freshmen who are starting, every player on the bench and on the field is strong, we can distribute the ball well; every layer of the team is doing its job well.”
HARVARD 2, PENN 1
Harvard routed Yale 6-0 last week in its first Ancient Eight game but found Penn to be a more formidable opponent. After a scoreless first half, the team struck early in the second behind a conversion from junior midfielder Bente van Vlijmen in the 39th minute. Van Vlijmen’s goal put her in the lead for most points in the Ivy League this season, with 23. The junior has been an offensive force for the team with those 23 points resulting from nine goals and five assists.
The Crimson couldn’t rest long though, as the Quakers evened the game just seven minutes later behind a goal off of a penalty. The match remained tied for the next 17 minutes before sophomore forward Natalie Sicher slung a shot past the goalie on an assist from freshman midfielder Kiley Allen with 7:30 left to play.
“We had some good transfers, defense really set up well, so that was a huge part of our game,” Allin said. “Also [we had] a fantastic goal by Natalie Sicher, straight into the top corner, which gave us the lead.”
Despite the close score, Harvard remained on the offensive for most of the game, attempting eight shots, three on goal, to Penn’s two shots, only one of which was on goal.  The Quakers drop to 4-5 — 1-1 in conference play — after the defeat.
“Yesterday’s game was tough,” Allin said. “Ivy League games are always tough, because there’s a lot of pressure on us.”
Harvard has a tough schedule ahead, playing at Brown on Friday and at Boston University on Sunday. The biggest game, though, will be on Oct. 20 at Princeton, a must-win contest against the fifth-ranked team nationally for the conference title. With results like this weekend’s, though, the Crimson has plenty to look forward to as the season moves into conference play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine a slow chess match. Both sides have time to think, to calculate.
Now imagine a third baseman fielding a rocket line drive. There’s no time to calculate — only time for instinct to kick in.
The Harvard women’s soccer team returned home this weekend to take on the Yale Bulldogs in a fast-paced, back-and-forth game decided by which team had the greater killer instinct. A moment’s hesitation on either side of the ball meant a missed opportunity or an allowed goal.
“Yale has a high-powered offense, but we knew that they’d also been susceptible at the back,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “We knew this was going to be a wide-open game. We said to the team before the game, ‘We have to make sure that we are taking advantage of their backline better than they take advantage of ours.’”
With an incessantly aggressive defense, yet another shutout performance by its goalkeeper, and a first-half game-winner from freshman defender Jillian Wachira, the Crimson demonstrated how effective its hunger to win can be in a 1-0 victory over Yale on Saturday night.
The win gives Harvard (4-4-1, 1-0-1 Ivy) its first conference triumph and extends its non-losing streak to three. Yale (5-4-1, 0-2-0), meanwhile, leaves Jordan Field still searching for its first Ivy win.
Wachira, a rookie out of Plainsboro, N.J., provided the decisive lift to the Crimson squad with a left-footed strike just inside the box past Yale junior goalie Alyssa Fagel in the 29th minute. The tally, aside from being the game-winner, was also Wachira’s first career goal.
“I just saw the pocket and I went,” Wachira said. “Lara [Schenk] got the ball, I called for it, luckily she played me, and I was like, ‘You know what, I might as well take it.’ I beat the girl and I just shot.”
Freshman midfielder Lara Schenk, previously a member of the German Youth National Team U15-U19, was credited with her first points of the season. Playing her first game in a Harvard jersey, Schenk provided the assist to Wachira from midfield. Wachira gathered the pass, beat the first defender, and rocketed a shot inside the right post with another defender in her face.
“I was afraid it wasn’t going to go in,” Wachira added with a laugh. “But, you know, I took my chance.”
With the scoreline at 1-0, the Crimson kept up its high-energy play to keep the Bulldogs off the board.
Junior defender Kimaya Cole, sophomore defender Linda Liedel, and Wachira were at the heart of an assertive defense that controlled the sidelines and pushed up to challenge every Yale attack. As a unit, the Crimson has not allowed a goal in its last three games, and on the season, has won all four of its victories in shutout fashion.
Anchoring the defense thus far has been senior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel. The veteran has allowed only two goals in nine games this season, sporting a .913 save percentage and a 4-2-1 win-loss record.
In fact, Etzel hasn’t allowed a goal since Aug. 26, over a month ago. In addition, the senior out of Madison, Conn., leads the Ivy League with a 0.30 goals-against-average over 600-plus minutes of action.
On Saturday night, Etzel made three saves in 90 minutes of work for her fourth individual shutout of the season. One of those saves was a crucial leg save late in the first half to preserve the 1-0 lead.
“I think it just comes down to trust and working for each other, working with each other,” Etzel said. “We all have that same mindset, that same goal that we’re achieving — to get a shutout — and we lift each other up.”
On the other end of the ball, Hamblin noted that Harvard created a bevy of scoring chances but failed to capitalize on them in the heat of the frenzies. The Crimson took 11 shots to the Bulldogs’ nine, and took three corners while Yale took four. Sophomore forward Murphy Agnew took four of Harvard’s shots, two of them forcing saves.
“We did a really good job in creating chances today —w e probably created as many chances as we’ve created this season,” Hamblin said. “We’d have liked to have scored more, but we didn’t. We had to rely on team defensive play to enable us to get out with a win. It showed us we have the quality to get good chances, but now we have to go and make sure we’re putting those away.”
Notably, in the first minute of the second half, both Agnew and freshman forward Sophie Hirst had chances deep in the box to score with the Bulldog goalie on the ground, but the ball was cleared following a scramble in front of the net.
Senior co-captain Zayne Matulis subsequently cleaned up the rebound and sent a shot directly into the body of her teammate Hirst, who unknowingly saved a goal for Yale whilst on the ground.
Throughout the game, it was clear that the scoreline could easily have been more than just 1-0. Moving forward, key for the Crimson will be finishing the opportunities it creates.
But until next weekend, when it takes on Cornell at home, Harvard can practice this week knowing it surpassed its Ivy League rival in a game full of counterattacks and all-out sprints. Keeping up the energy to compete stride-for-stride with its competition was paramount.
“It comes from the team atmosphere, us holding each other up, knowing that we were getting fatigued,” Wachira said. “We’re very close as a team — we don’t really have cliques, everyone is very close with everyone, and I think that helps because it creates such a supportive environment.”
That kind of team chemistry was fostered enormously by last year’s graduating Crimson seniors of 2018, with whom Wachira and her fellow rookies didn’t get to play, but with whom players such as Etzel and the rest of the upperclassmen did. The holdover environment has seemingly been passed on to the 2018-19 squad.
With one win and one draw under its belt in Ivy League play, Harvard can look to the future with optimism.
“I think just build on momentum,” said Etzel of the approach to the team’s upcoming games. “We played pretty well this game, not getting too far ahead of ourselves and keeping our heads down and [keeping on] working.”
The Crimson’s 1-0 victory over Yale on Saturday night is a form of revenge for Harvard, which lost handily to the Bulldogs in New Haven last year, 3-0.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard (3-5, 1-0 Ivy) extended its unbeaten streak against Yale (4-3-1, 0-1) to five years as the team opened its 2018 Ivy League play with a 1-0 win at Jordan Field on Saturday evening.
The Crimson came into the match boasting an impressive recent record against the Bulldogs, as well as a sizeable lead in the all-time matchup, which stands at 54-38-12 in Harvard’s favor. The Crimson has not lost to Yale since 2013 and is unbeaten in the matchup at home since 2005. Harvard looked from kickoff as if it was hungry to maintain that record.
“We always get to start Ivy League against Yale and that’s fantastic,” said defender and captain Nathan Goldberg. “This is probably the game that gets the guys most fired up. It’s really a privilege to take part in the oldest rivalry in American sports history.”
Sophomore goalkeeper Matt Freese was given lots of work to do early, saving well from a free-kick in the first minute before getting down to make an even better stop on the ensuing rebound. The action kept coming for the Crimson’s goalkeeper, who came up big again for Harvard just seconds later in the second minute. The Bryn Mawr, Penn., native denied sophomore forward Aldo Quevedo at edge of box in a one-on-one situation after a nicely-weighted pass from just beyond midfield split the Crimson defense.
Yale’s in-form freshman forward Paolo Carroll almost bagged his fourth goal in as many games in the eighth minute, slotting through Freese’s legs after being played through on goal, but the play was called back for offside.
It was a hard-hitting game early, with both sets of players letting one other know that they were there. The teams and benches were vocal on nearly every call, and there were a lot of calls to make, as the teams nearly split the game’s whopping 35 fouls, with Harvard collecting 18.
Good interplay between freshman forward Alfred Perez and sophomore Paolo Belloni-Urso in the 27th minute led to Harvard’s best chance of the opening half hour, but the midfielder’s dipping effort was saved by the Bulldogs’ sophomore goalkeeper Tom Wallenstein before it could find the bottom corner. It took the Crimson just four touches to get from its own 18-yard box into Yale’s, one example of Harvard’s ability to play the long game effectively.
The Crimson came close again near the end of the half, when freshman forward Nico Garcia-Morillo found the ball in a pocket of space in the box in the 37th minute. Fellow freshman forward Alex Debayo-Doherty started the move after he split two defenders down the line to find Belloni-Urso near the corner of the box. Belloni-Urso’s cross found Garcia-Morillo, who had more time than he may have thought, firing his first-time effort over the bar from close range.
Junior Miguel Yuste almost found the back of the net in the 49th minute for Yale after some skillful dribbling opened up a yard of space for the midfielder near the edge of the box. His shot looked to be heading for the top right corner, but it whizzed just inches wide of the frame of the goal.
Perez broke the deadlock for Harvard in the 59th minute, finishing cleverly for his second goal of the season following a defensive miscue from Yale. Senior defender Cameron Riach attempted to redirect a bouncing ball back to his goalkeeper, but his header lacked power, allowing Perez to swoop in and pick up the loose ball. His first-touch chip sailed over the onrushing keeper and into the back of the net to give the Crimson the lead with half an hour remaining.
“It’s a moment I’ve been waiting for.” said Perez of his first Ivy League goal. “We work hard all season, so to achieve success in our first Ivy League game means a lot. There’s a lot to work on, but this is a good start, and we can build off of this.”
It was a wide-open, back and forth game throughout, with the Bulldogs just edging Harvard in the share of the chances, and the majority of possession throughout most of the game. The Crimson began to look more lively following the goal, as Yale had to commit more men forward in search of an equalizer.
Harvard again employed a number of young players, and were rewarded for its faith in its youth. Freshmen Debayo Doherty, Perez, midfielder Havard Hjermstad, and sophomores Freese, Belloni-Urso, and midfielder Sebastian Lindner-Liaw all came up big for the Crimson, with the younger players leading the charge offensively. Disciplined performances from veteran defenders kept Harvard in the game on the other side of the field. Captain Sam Brown played a strong game on defense, his biggest contribution coming when he got down to make a vital block in the six-yard box in the 26th minute as senior midfielder Nicky Downs closed in on goal. Fellow seniors Jack Miler and Eduardo Cedeño helped to ensure the clean sheet for the Crimson by keeping the Bulldogs’ lively forwards in check.
Freese made another great save in the 88th minute to deny a rocket from Yuste from the edge of the box, which looked to be heading straight towards the top left corner. A strong touch from Freese knocked the shot over the bar to safety, for the keeper’s fifth and most important save of the game.
“Having Matt Freese in goal is great.” Goldberg said. “He’s so dependable, we can trust him to pull out those big saves at the start of the game, and at the end of the game as well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though co-captain Christina Cornelius secured 23 kills for the Crimson over two Ivy League conference games, Harvard fell 3-1 to both Cornell and Columbia on the road this weekend.
Following a four game win streak in the middle of September, the Crimson’s quest for the Ancient Eight title has hit a roadblock with the start of Ivy League play. Since Sept. 21, Harvard (5-7, 0-3 Ivy) has lost to Dartmouth (5-8, 1-2), Cornell (8-5, 3-0) and Columbia (8-5, 3-1). These games have been marked by strong defensive plays and offensive struggles.
COLUMBIA 3, HARVARD 1
On Saturday, the Crimson traveled to New York City to take on Columbia. Following a career high 43 assists against Columbia, freshman setter and outside hitter Bella Almanza recorded 27 of Harvard’s 38 assists on the game, helping Cornelius connect on 15 kills, two shy of her career record of 17.
After Columbia captured the first set, 25-19, and the second set, 25-16, Cornelius came alive with five kills, each assisted by Almanza, in the third set.
At first, the Lions and the Crimson traded points, until Harvard went on a 10-2 run, allowing the momentum of the set to turn their direction. Within this run, Almanza assisted on the kills, which came from across all the Crimson’s court.
Even with the momentum of the third set, Harvard battled, but dropped the fourth set, 22-25, to go 0-2 on the weekend.
CORNELL 3, HARVARD 1
On Friday, the Crimson fought against Cornell in all four sets, losing 20-25 in the first, 19-25 in the third, and 17-25 in the fourth. Sophomore outside hitter Mindie Mabry had a standout game against the Big Red as she amassed 10 kills over the four sets.
In the first set, Harvard was down by as many as nine points, ultimately fighting back to only lose the set by five. According to senior middle/right side attacker Jocelyn Meyer, the Crimson struggled at the start against the Big Red.
“Definitely at the beginning of both matches we were struggling to get started,” Meyer said. “But once we got started we were making some pretty great plays, getting scrappy touches, picking it up on our block, getting touches on the block, but from there we were not translating those touches into offensive points.”
Harvard bounced back after the slow first set. After three straight kills by Mabry, junior outside hitter Grace Roberts Burbank, and junior middle blocker Maclaine Fields, the Crimson stole the momentum of the match early. But the Big Red continued to put up a fight, creating a battle between the two sides.
At one point tied 15-15, Harvard capitalized on Cornell errors to pull the set away, ultimately winning 25-21. Following the second set, the momentum turned toward the Big Red as the home team captured both the third set, 19-25, and the fourth set, 17-25.
Looking forward, Cornelius hopes that the team uses this weekend to help light a fire under the team during practice.
“We just need to get into our season,” Cornelius said. “One thing that our team talks about all the time is ‘glurgency’ in practice, which basically means game-like urgency. So in practice instead of thinking, ‘Oh it’s just practice,’ I am going to play with the mentality that I would play with in a game. So making sure that we are intentional about every pass, every set, every hit that we do. Making sure that when we see our own players on the other side of the net we are actually imagining playing Penn, Princeton, Yale.”
As the team’s season continues, both Meyer and Cornelius are excited at the team’s prospects, as the Crimson plays each conference team twice.
“We definitely need to keep in mind that anything can happen in the Ivy League,” Meyer said. “It is tough obviously if you start off with three losses in the Ivy League since it is so competitive in the race for the Ivy League ring. But we have seen in the past couple of years how anything can happen, even if you lose a couple of matches.”

On Wednesday, Sept. 19, a swarm of students descended on the Leverett Library Theatre. The draw? Free sushi, cake, and a new patron of Harvard’s film scene. This year, A24, the independent film studio behind hits like “Moonlight,” “Lady Bird,” and “Hereditary,” launched campus initiatives in conjunction with interns at schools across the country, including Harvard, to encourage young filmmakers and support local college film festivals. The students behind A24 at Harvard had arranged an inaugural launch party and screening of their new movie “Eighth Grade” to celebrate their arrival on campus and open a new chapter in Harvard film.
Stephen P. Lombardo ’21, student
RR: Why did you come to the event today?
SPL: I’ve been wanting to join the Harvard College Film Festival, and help work with that. And I know A24 is affiliated with it this year, and [the Film Festival] told us about this, and it seemed like an awesome opportunity to come meet some people, and go to a show.
RR: Have you seen anything by A24 before?
SPL: “Lady Bird” last year. I missed “Hereditary," but “Lady Bird” was my favorite film of last year and I think A24 is doing a great job of taking filmmakers and helping them out and bringing their really personal works to the big screen.
RR: What impact do you think A24’s presence will have on campus?
SPL: What it’s done so far has been drawing people into helping with the film festival, to join in their initiatives this fall. A24 is a big name, people love their movies, so it definitely brings attention to some of those clubs that do awesome work but don’t have as much notoriety.
Timothy Im ’21, and Yuke Zheng ’21, students
RR: Why did you come to the event today?
YZ: I’m a big fan of A24, I’ve seen several of their movies, and I guess I’m just a big fan of any campus driven movie initiative.
TI: A24 movies are some of my favorites, and I thought [a representative from] A24 was going to be here tonight.
RR: What are your favorite A24 films?
TI: I think probably “Lady Bird.” I thought “Hereditary” was so overhyped, honestly. It felt like it was just trying to be different for the sake of difference. Besides “Lady Bird," I just saw “Room.” It was really good.
YZ: “Ex Machina.”
TI: Is “The Spectacular Now” A24? That’s got to be my favorite.
RR: What impact do you think A24’s presence will have on campus?
YZ: The Film Festival has been around for a while, but it’s been very under the radar. I’d like to see something more cohesive on campus.
TI: I think if there’s free A24 movies, I’ll be there.
Sam F. Reed ’19, student
RR: What made you come to the event today?
SFR: I’ve seen one other thing A24 has done, “Hereditary,” which was excellent. And I’ve been a Bo Burnham fan for a long time, so I’ve wanted to see “Eighth Grade” and haven’t gotten around to it so this is a good way to do it.
RR: What do you like about A24 films?
SFR: My only experience is with “Hereditary” and “Eighth Grade,” but there’s an earnest quality to both of these that is lacking elsewhere. Like in the horror genre, for example, there’s a lot of tropes, and pumping movies out because you know you can make money, and “Hereditary” didn’t seem that way, which was refreshing. And neither does “Eighth Grade,” which is a really fresh take on the classic coming-of-age story.
RR: What impact do you think A24’s initiative will have on filmmakers here at Harvard?
SFR: Admittedly, this is coming from someone who has been really unaware or at least unaffiliated with the film community on campus, but I would hope that it would just boost the community and have a positive impact. Anything beyond that, any gained traction, would be even better. This isn’t an A24 appreciation club, this is A24 at Harvard, and I think that lends it a lot of weight, and that will get people more interested. It’s the same “we actually give a shit quality” that makes their movies so refreshing.

We’ve all heard of the classic dhall crush, but the truth is: Harvard students like to keep their options open. And just as surely as you’re juggling interviews with Goldman, McKinsey and Bain all at once, you probably have more than one romantic interest on your mind. Here's the whole spectrum of crushes that all of us have, but none of us would ever admit to having:
The not-in-your-house crush
You don’t see this person often enough for them to be considered your dhall crush, but they do seem to be hanging around your house quite a bit. Maybe they’re on a sports team that regularly eats breakfast in your house, or perhaps they have a class nearby. Sorry to dash your hopes, but they could just be dating someone in your house.
Concentration crush
You have way too many classes with this person, and every time they participate they seem to know more about the field of study than you. The good thing about this kind of crush is that you never run out of things to talk about, but on the flip side it’s hard to make the transition from pset buddies to, well, more than pset buddies.
Instagram crush
You’ve been following this person (on Instagram) since Visitas, but you never run into them IRL, so you’re not sure what they look like without a filter. Unfortunately for you, Instagram DM is the lowest mode of communication.
Loker Reading Room crush
This is a forbidden love situation, because you’re literally not allowed to talk to them. Fortunately for you, the stacks aren’t too far away…
Who said it was hard to find love at Harvard? If only we had enough social skills to act on our debilitating, angsty crushes.
