After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last week, members of the Harvard faculty approved the College’s first-ever honor code, likely to go into effect in the fall of 2015. The code will require students to make regular affirmation of their academic integrity. In the aftermath of the unprecedented Government 1310 cheating scandal, in which nearly two percent of the student body came under investigation for academic dishonesty, the new honor code represents a positive and needed measure.
Some faculty, like former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68, have expressed doubts concerning  the honor code’s effectiveness, and in an ideal world, we might be able to adhere to Harvard’s long-standing tradition of not asking its members to take oaths or pledges. At the same time, the Gov. 1310 scandal showcased a deep crisis of integrity at the College, the graveness of which could not be simply ignored by the faculty.
The detractors may be right when they say that an honor code would clunkily address symptoms of academic dishonesty—but studies show colleges with honor codes exhibit significantly less cheating than those without. While an implicit understanding of honor among the Harvard community is more desirable than an explicit code, inculcating that understanding among students is a difficult task that must start somewhere. An honor code is a positive step toward that end. 
As such, the honor code should be more than a limp paragraph, dutifully affixed to syllabi or hurriedly name-checked in an introductory lecture and never brought up again. In order to have any effect on the student body, the honor code must be proudly and assiduously advocated by tutors, administrators, and professors.
The admissions officers who recruit applicants should especially emphasize the honor code in their correspondence with future students in order to convey from the outset the academic expectations of the Harvard community. The California Institute of Technology’s honor code, which is proudly and prominently featured in the school’s admissions literature, might serve as a good example in this regard. 
When implemented, Harvard’s proposed honor code will likely transfer most, if not all, academic dishonesty from the jurisdiction of the Administrative Board to a newly created “honor board,” which will include students as well as faculty. Considering the frustrating opacity that students often ascribe to the Ad Board, the membership of actual students in these decisions would go far in furthering disciplinary transparency at Harvard as well as student ownership over the process.
At every other Ivy League school, undergraduates already sit on judicial boards or are involved in disciplinary proceedings in one form or another. All but Yale have instituted a formal honor code or declaration of academic integrity. It’s commendable that Harvard will catch up to its peer institutions, though unfortunate that it took a major cheating scandal to catalyze that needed transformation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Much has been done these last few weeks to address the critical issue of sexual assault on Harvard’s campus: formation of task forces, a call to action from student activists, and a promise from the administration to make combatting sexual assault—through both prevention and response—a top priority. All of these efforts are admirable and a sign that hopefully survivors and victims of sexual assault on our campus will have justice and better support in the future. 
  But with all the discussion and energy in the last month, I was surprised and disappointed that—yet again—turnout for Sexual Assault Awareness Month events was low. Organized every April by both students and administrators in the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (full disclosure—I am one of the students) SAAM features weekly events that grapple with difficult questions about sexual assault. This year included a community conversation about sexual assault at Harvard, a panel on the relationship between race and sexual assault in the media, a conversation with journalist Maureen Orth on the dynamics of power and sexual assault perpetration, a conversation on feminist porn with Tristan Taormino, and more.
So much effort goes into planning these diverse and thoughtful events. And yet every year, it feels like pulling teeth to get people to come. I thought this year would be different, but once again, it often felt like the efforts of OSAPR to organize these important conversations were ignored and dismissed. 
There is so much going on constantly on this campus. It is physically impossible to attend every event or conversation that you think is meaningful and relevant. Here I am bemoaning the lack of participation in my organization’s events when I’ve missed countless others that are just as important. I observed Divest Harvard protests with interest and a desire to learn more, but I did not engage in them—I was more intent on rushing past to get to my Oggi’s sandwich (lunch is a cause I care deeply about). Furthermore, the topics discussed during SAAM are difficult and emotional, so many people opt out for personal reasons. 
All the same, while I can’t ask for a packed room at every event, I was expecting more engagement from a campus that has been up in arms for the last month about Harvard’s failure to foster an environment with a healthy attitude towards sexual assault. With The Crimson’s publication of crucial op-eds, such as the very brave “Dear Harvard: You Win,” I suppose I was expecting news coverage to break with tradition and cover OSAPR’s efforts this year. But yet again, even with all the publicizing we did, I never read of a SAAM event on the front page. 
It is so easy to write a vehement Facebook status about how “Harvard welcomes rapists” (a statement that I find ridiculous and inflammatory). It’s much harder, of course, to listen and learn about sexual assault both in the world and on our campus. The best way to prevent sexual assault, in my opinion, is through education. But the first step to learning is actually showing up for class. 
Again, I understand it’s unrealistic to pay every cause here the amount of attention it deserves, and I admit that I’ve missed a few SAAM events as well. But along with criticizing and pushing our administration to do better, we must also engage when they are doing their best. OSAPR does excellent work in educating students about sexual assault and how to prevent it—I have witnessed firsthand the dedication and passion that the director and education specialists bring to their difficult tasks. But these efforts hardly ever get attention. It becomes disheartening to read only of what OSAPR is supposedly doing wrong and never any acknowledgement of all the fantastic things they are doing right.
 If we as a university are going to dedicate ourselves to improving both prevention and response to sexual assault, we need to listen just as much as we speak up. For every Facebook status posted on this issue, we should have at least one conversation, attend one workshop, or reach out to one person involved in combating sexual violence. Here’s to next year being one of record-breaking attendance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
There is this joke about Goldman Sachs. An assistant hands a Managing Director at Goldman a thick pile of resumes. The Managing Director shuffles the pile, throws half into the shredder, and says "I don't hire unlucky people."
The Managing Director may be right. Luck is the defining characteristic of all successful people. If he wants successful employees, he should select from the lucky ones.
I come from a culture that firmly believes in luck. The fengshui of a casino table is supposed to determine the thickness of one’s wallet at the end of the day. The auspicious creature pixiu at the gate of a mansion is supposed to fend off bad luck and draw the qi of fortune. The sign of mature wisdom is zhi tianming—to know your own fate.
I think the Chinese are wise to show reverence for luck. After all, nothing else explains returns in a casino better. However, the Chinese are mistaken to think they can influence luck.  We cannot alter an outcome by changing the seating arrangement at the casino table or through the worship of an animal statues. Thinking that we can is superstition.
But we are above superstition now—we have science. We can now formally and mathematically define luck. Luck is the sum of a series of statistical noises that are uncorrelated with our control input. In other words, it is the aggregation of things that affect our life possibilities, which we have no control over.
This definition can greatly reduce the range of phenomena that used to be considered the result of luck. After graduation, I will be predicting short term price movements in the stock market. This used to be a line of work not dissimilar to astrology and tarot reading, but now, it is dominated by astrophysicists and statisticians. Life and death used to be in the hands of God, but modern medicine now understands risk factors that affect our chance of mortality. Modern science is brimming with hope that one day, we can understand and dominate all that is uncertain in our lives. But we are far from that day. There will always be a force, outside of our control, that decides our destiny.
So why am I talking about something that we cannot master?
First, we simply need to acknowledge the existence of luck.  We have a natural tendency to attribute things that happen by chance to actions of individuals. An NBA coach can be praised or blamed for his tactics in the last seconds of a game, even though whether the ball goes in the basket or not can be as random as a coin flip. The effect is even stronger when people evaluate their own success or failure. Those who have succeeded have the self-serving bias—they tend to believe it is their hard work, rather than luck, that leads to their fortune.
Most of us, Harvard students with all the modern conveniences, have been blessed with luck at many points in our lives. I am prone to believe that my hard work and decision making are responsible for my graduation from Harvard, and I need a sobering voice to remind me of my propitious circumstances.
Let’s go back to the Goldman Sachs joke. It is a silly hiring strategy because past luck is not correlated with future luck. While most of us have been lucky thus far, it is not guaranteed that the streak will last. Many of us aspire to change the world, and it will take a tremendous amount of luck to do so. Many of us will fail, not because we have not worked hard enough or have made the wrong decisions, but because of circumstances that we cannot control.
What can we do when luck fails us? I do not know, because I have never had any great misfortunes. I have had small misfortunes, though, many of which happened on poker tables. I have played my hands perfectly and lost by incredibly long shots. Should I have left the table when luck failed me? I think the right thing to do was to keep doing what I was doing before, knowing that it worked and can work in the future. I hoped for the best.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
 
On Monday night, the black mass contretemps degenerated into the farce many had long suspected it to be. After condemnation from the Catholic Church and University President Drew G. Faust, the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club decided to find an off-campus venue for the event. Those plans fell through, and the group shelved its sponsorship. With nowhere else to go, followers of the Satanic Temple performed their rite at the Kong, a refuge for drunk Harvard students and, that evening, a motley assortment of smokers clad in black clothes and chains. We should laugh off the event, but first we must consider the disturbing logical and moral distortions perpetrated by its decriers.
 Greta Van Susteren, on her Fox News program, compared the performance of a black Satanic mass to the burning of a Quran. That equivalency, picked up by a number of commentators, totally ignores the disparate relations to power the two groups have experienced historically. In the West, Islam is a minority faith whose adherents endure severe discrimination and unfair loyalty tests. Burning its holy books is nothing less than an open expression of hatred for Islam and Muslims.
  For a millennium, Catholics constituted a religious oligarchy in the Occident. The Church imposed its values on freethinkers, Jews, homosexuals, and other non-conformists. The mass was embedded in a system of domination. Indeed, false accusations of host desecration were frequent pretext for pogroms. In 1243, the entire Jewish population of the German town of Belitz was murdered on such charges. That pattern of violence would continue until the Reformation.
  This is not to refute the existence of anti-Catholic bigotry. In this land, Catholics were an object of persecution, denied job opportunities, free choice, and social acceptance by a Protestant elite. But whatever demon the black Satanic mass conjured, the specter of “Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion” was absent. Begun during the Middle Ages, the ritual is best understood as a protest against the Church’s repressive influence.
 In their op-ed published on Monday, Aurora C. Griffin ’14 and Luciana E. Milano ’14 claim the ceremony involves “desecrating the Eucharist... by placing it on the genitals of a naked woman, urinating on it, and slitting an infant’s throat to pour blood over it.” That statement is as fictive as the notion that the Harvard Extension Cultural Studies Club was “inviting the prince of darkness to sit among the most vulnerable of our community, the freshmen, in the safe space that they use to eat, socialize, and study.” The development of the black Satanic mass remains shrouded in mystery, and its practice seems to have varied from one period to the next. In all likelihood, the allegation of infanticide was the handiwork of Christian Judeophobes, and did not reflect the behavior of actual Satanists. The blood libel, the claim that Jews slaughter Gentile babies and use their blood to make matzoh for Passover, was a persistent anti-Semitic trope.
 One might argue that the University still should have canceled the event. Campus Catholics lack any connection with medieval atrocities, and the black Satanic mass offends their religious feelings. Such a prohibition, though, would be antithetical to the University’s mission to foster an open and lively discourse. To preserve that ideal, we must tolerate all expression–as long as it is not endorsed by the University–that we find objectionable. That includes desecration of a host and, though mean and ill-advised, hate speech, such as the burning of a Quran.
 Under the standards they advance, some opponents of the black Satanic mass would find themselves censored. Milano, for example, heads the campus chapter of the Anscombe Society (“where traditional values meet Harvard”), a group that advocates a particularly démodé view of gender, sexual ethics, and social organization. The club’s platforms define marriage as “the exclusive and monogamous union between a man and a woman.” They maintain that there are “inherent physical, behavioral, emotional, and psychological differences between men and women.” They also imply that the mainstream feminist movement demanded “that women should become more like men.” Deeply hurtful to many female and LGBTQ Harvardians, these beliefs are religious in origin, and, outside the bubble of Cambridge, Massachusetts, create human misery. The black Satanic mass was once a way to resist ecclesiastical social control. Perhaps it has not outlived its purpose.

Meredith Weenick ’90, the former chief financial officer for the City of Boston, will return to Harvard this summer as the University’s vice president for campus services, a position which includes oversight of more than 1,500 employees and the ongoing construction of the Smith Campus Center, the University announced on Tuesday.
After graduating from Harvard Business School in 2002, Weenick joined the office of Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino as a policy advisor. In 2007, she took more control of the city’s finances as an associate director of the Office of Administration and Finance before rising to become the city’s CFO in 2010. When Menino left office in January of 2014, Weenick stayed on to help new mayor Martin J. Walsh prepare his first budget.
Weenick has also served local volunteer groups, including the Cambridge-based non-profit Transition House, which provides support to victims of domestic violence.
Weenick, who will begin work at Harvard on July 14, replaces Lisa Hogarty, who served as vice president for campus services from 2010 until earlier this year when she announced her departure for a similar position at Dartmouth.
The vice president for campus services manages many of the daily operations on campus. Weenick will oversee not only the construction of the campus center, but also the Common Spaces Initiative, emergency services, and the management and operations of Harvard’s vast real estate portfolio.
“As an alumna of both the College and the Business School, I feel a tremendous connection to Harvard, which inspired me to public service and has had an immeasurable effect on my career,” Weenick said in the University’s press release. “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to direct the team responsible for the day-to-day operations of the institution.”
Weenick will report to the University’s executive vice president, Katherine N. Lapp, who emphasized the scope of Weenick’s position in a statement Tuesday.
“Managing the daily operations of an institution as large as Harvard while pursuing a strategic vision that supports its teaching and research mission requires a leader to maintain a delicate balance,” Lapp said. “The skills that Meredith has honed with the City of Boston and several service-oriented organizations will be a tremendous asset to the University.”

The concentration in Environmental Science and Public Policy, in conjunction with the Harvard University Center for the Environment, plans to introduce a secondary field in Energy and Environment for the upcoming fall semester.
"Our faculty and students have vital roles to play in confronting the challenge of climate change, and we’re committed to advancing their work,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement. “This new secondary field creates an important new academic pathway for our undergraduates to engage with one of the most pressing issues of our time."
According to the ESPP website, the new secondary aims to “increase students' exposure to, and literacy in, the interconnecting set of issues related to energy and the environment.”
Daniel P. Schrag, director of the Center for the Environment and professor of geology, said that the new program stands apart from other subjects taught at Harvard because of its interdisciplinary nature.
“It touches on just about every discipline we have at Harvard,” he said.
The new secondary requires four courses: one elementary course from a list of six possible options and three additional upper-level courses. Of these three electives, at least one must be in the Social Sciences and Humanities category and at least one from Natural Sciences and Engineering.
“We wanted to create a secondary field that could introduce students to the issues but also allow them to fit it into their schedules,” Schrag said.
Students must additionally attend at least one of several evening discussion sessions with faculty members affiliated with the Center for the Environment.
“We want students to be exposed to real world issues,” Head Tutor for ESPP Paul R. Moorcroft said, pointing to these discussions as an opportunity for exposure to these topics.
Proponents of the new field said that the secondary is not designed solely for students studying the sciences.
“We wanted to give undergraduates from every possible concentration some perspective on these issues, because they affect everyone here,” Schrag said.
While the new secondary will fall under the ESPP concentration, its administration will be housed in the Center for the Environment.

The Senate confirmation process of Harvard Law School professor David J. Barron ’89 continues to provoke controversy as a vocal group of senators from both the left and right call for the public release of memos, which Barron allegedly wrote during his time as a lawyer for the Justice Department. Those memos established the legal justification for the Obama administration’s controversial drone policy.
Barron, who was nominated in September by President Barack Obama for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the first circuit, allegedly penned papers that justified the killing of Anwar Al-Awlaki, an American-born terrorist who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011 in Yemen.
On May 5, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to every U.S. senator urging them to refrain from supporting Barron before reading the memos he penned.
The ACLU’s letter called the memos “the purported legal foundation for a large-scale killing program that has resulted in…as many as 4,700 deaths by drone attacks.”
The White House subsequently offered senators a chance to view the papers, which are currently available for senators to review in a secure area, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s statement at a press conference yesterday.
Although the 2nd Court of Appeals ordered the administration to publicly release a redacted version of the papers last month, the White House lawyers have yet to disclose them.
"David Barron is highly qualified, but as one of the authors of the Anwar al-Awlaki opinion, Barron's nomination understandably raises key questions,” said Democratic Senator Mark Udall in a statement. “Unless the White House complies, I cannot support David Barron's nomination."
The nomination has also drawn concerns from the other side of the aisle. Republican Senators Rand Paul and Chuck Grassley, critics of the Obama administration’s drone policy, have called for the public release of the memos.
Despite objections, others have voiced support for Barron.
Barron’s colleagues, law professors Laurence H. Tribe ’62 and Charles Fried, called for his confirmation in a co-written letter to the Boston Globe published yesterday.
“Barron is brilliant lawyer who will make an excellent judge,” Tribe and Fried wrote. “What is clear to us is that Barron would decide cases based solely on the relevant sources of legal authority, including binding precedent, and that his political views would in no way distort his legal judgment.”
Law School dean Martha L. Minow also lauded Barron both for his knowledge of the law and his objectivity.
“David Barron’s work as a lawyer and as a scholar is absolutely top-notch and so is his ability to stand back from contentious subjects, consider the facts, and provide thorough, sage, and fair analysis,” Minow said in a statement to The Crimson.
Barron, who served as president of The Crimson and attended Harvard Law School before returning to teach, is married to the Massachusetts Democratic gubernatorial candidate Juliette N. Kayyem ’91.
This is not the first roadblock that Barron’s nomination has faced. Barron’s liberal interpretation of the constitution also drew criticism during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in January. Barron narrowly passed through committee on vote of 10-8, which split down party lines.
The full Senate has yet to vote on his confirmation.

A man was arrested for disorderly conduct on Sunday evening after jumping on stage during a concert featuring violinist Vladimir T. Spivakov to deliver a speech protesting the musician’s support for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s actions in Ukraine.
Roman J. Torgovitsky, an alumnus of both the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Health, was arrested at 8:55 p.m. on the stage of Sanders Theatre, according to the Harvard University Police Department.
“While on detail monitoring a concern, an officer observed an individual run onto the stage and get extremely close to the performer in a confrontational manner,” the report reads. “The performance was disrupted by this individual on stage. The officer immediately placed the individual under arrest.”
Torgovitsky, who said in an interview Tuesday that he had dreamed of attending one of Spivakov’s concerts since childhood, added that he leapt onto the stage in order to both praise the musician “for the beautiful things that he has done” and engage in a dialogue concerning Spivakov’s support for Putin.
Spivakov was among several hundred cultural figures who signed a controversial letter supporting Putin’s stances on Ukraine and Crimea. The Russian president has been accused of leading an illegal invasion of Ukraine and annexation of the Crimean Peninsula through a fraudulent referendum.
“In the days when the fate of Crimea and our countrymen is being decided, Russia's cultural figures cannot remain indifferent, cold-hearted observers,” reads an English translation of the letter. “We want the commonality of our peoples and our cultures to have a strong future. This is why we firmly declare our support of the position of the President of the Russian Federation in regards to Ukraine and Crimea.”
The incident occurred as audience members applauded between songs. Torgovitsky said he stepped onto the stage, presented Spivakov with a Harvard hat which he had bought as a gift, and then began discussing the violinist’s support for Putin.
According to Torgovitsky, after he mentioned that letter Spivakov had signed, the crowd in Sanders Theatre began booing him, and video footage of the incident shows Spivakov approaching him aggressively.
Torgovitsky said Tuesday that he only tried to confront Spivakov on stage because other avenues of communication with the violinist seemed to be closed.
Neither Spivakov nor the tour’s managers could be reached for comment. A University spokesperson also declined to comment on the incident beyond pointing to the police report.
“He was ready to fight,” Torgovitsky said. “A couple of musicians came up and held his hands back.”
The video shows that a HUPD officer then crossed to the center of Sanders and picked up Torgovitsky, carrying him offstage while members of the crowd clapped and whistled.
According to Torgovitsky, while he stood handcuffed outside of Memorial Hall, exiting audience members made threats to him.
Torgovitsky was arrested and charged both at the HUPD police station and the Cambridge Police Department station for disorderly conduct. Additionally, he said he was banned by Harvard police from stepping foot on the University’s property.
During a court appearance at 9 a.m. on Monday morning, a judge dismissed Torgovitsky’s case.
Torgovitsky’s actions came as a crowd of at least 40 people protested the concert on the sidewalks outside of Memorial Hall on Sunday. Torgovitsky said he was not involved with the protestors outside.
Spivakov’s performance on Sunday was one stop in a larger tour honoring the Moscow Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra’s 35th anniversary.

Malavika Jayaram, a visiting fellow at the Berkman Center For Internet and Society, spoke about India’s new identification systems and the privacy concerns surrounding them at a luncheon discussion Tuesday.
 
During the event, which was entitled “Does Size Matter? A Tale of Performing Welfare, Producing Bodies and Faking Identity,” Jayaram discussed the use of biometric databases to identify and authenticate India’s population. She spoke specifically of two databases—the Unique Identification Authority of India and the National Population Register—which jointly have roughly 600 million people enrolled.
Both projects are run by the government, but while the Identification Authority is currently being rolled out in 16 states and is on a voluntary basis, the National Population Register is nationwide and mandatory.
 
Efforts towards making a comprehensive and universal identification system in India are not new, but the biometrics system, which uses iris scanning, facial recognition, and fingerprints to recognize individuals, is the most recent form of identification that the government and independent programmers have pursued.
Jayaram explained that there is an increasing need for identification in India, especially with the exponential growth of the population.
 
“India as a country is a very artificial political construct,” Jayaram said. “There is a desperate need to be identified and be made visible to the government. Something like an identification scheme is so compelling that they don't just sell it as identification, they sell it as identity.”
 
During the discussion, Jayaram showed ads that are currently being used in India to support the identification effort. She said that citizens are prompted to enroll in the system through these ads, which target individuals’ sense of patriotism and belonging in the community.
 
“It’s all about nation-building,” Jayaram said, noting that the ads called for people to “feel part of one country” and to “feel proud to be Indian” by enrolling in the system.
“It’s a very seductive vision of inclusion and belonging,” she said.
 
Jayaram also warned the audience about the negative implications of the database and how the current use of biometrics raises concerns about surveillance and privacy. The body is now being used as a password, she said.
“Data leakages are happening all over the place,” she added.
 
Dalia Othman, a colleague of Jayaram and fellow at the Berkman Center, noted how Jayaram was the perfect person to speak about the topic.
“It was really interesting to hear about the complexities about the identity system in India and it was great the Malavika could walk us through them,” Othman said.

Emily W. Stokes-Rees, resident dean of Cabot House, will leave Harvard this summer for a tenure-track position at Syracuse University.
Stokes-Rees, an anthropologist who joined the College administration in the summer of 2012, said that her departure from Cabot is coming a year or two earlier than she anticipated, but that it makes sense considering the opportunity at Syracuse.
Stokes-Rees called her time as a resident dean “two years of just really intense learning and personal and professional development” in an interview Tuesday. Adding that her upcoming departure will provoke mixed feelings, Stokes-Rees said that she will miss the students and staff in Cabot “enormously."
“Cabot has been an amazing place,” Stokes-Rees said. “I will miss this community.”
In an email to the Crimson, Cabot House co-masters Rakesh and Stephanie R. Khurana wrote that Stokes-Rees’s departure is “bittersweet” for them.
 
“During her two years, Emily has made numerous contributions to the intellectual, social, and personal well-being of our students,” the co-masters wrote in the email. “She has been a great student advocate and has worked tireless hours in pursuit of supporting students academically and personally, as well as the community overall.”
Sharon L. Howell, longtime Adams House resident dean, called Stokes-Rees a “brave, committed person” in an interview Tuesday, saying that she “brought a real intellectual energy” to the role. “She stayed true to her nature as an academic and made sure to think about her role in the House through that lens,” said Howell, who will also depart Harvard this summer.
Howell added that she and others at the College will “miss [Stokes-Rees’s] real compassion and energy for working with students."
Stokes-Rees, who also lectures in the Anthropology department within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, came to Harvard after serving as a postdoctoral fellow at Brown University. Stokes-Rees joined the College administration in what was a tumultuous year, as the Administrative Board investigated the Government 1310 cheating scandal, Harvard’s largest in recent memory.
Howell said that Stokes-Rees “took on the role at a difficult time with a lot of grace and good humor.”
Stokes-Rees, for her part, said she recognizes that the year was an “enormous amount of work” in retrospect. Since she was new to the role when the Ad Board investigated the case, she pointed out that she “didn’t know what life as a resident dean would be like otherwise.” She added that this current academic year has been “intense in other ways.”
“I think the resident dean position, no matter what form it takes, is going to be busy,” Stokes-Rees said.
Cabot House Committee Co-Chair Caroline R. Breinin ’15, who entered Cabot House the same year that Stokes-Rees took up her position, said her resident dean “has been fabulous” over the last two years.
“She’s been a great part of the Cabot community,” Breinin said. “I think something really special to the Cabot community is how Stephanie, Rakesh, and Emily have been able to foster such an inclusive [community], and she’s been a wonderful part of it.”
The announcement of Stokes-Rees’s departure comes ahead of what will be a period of transition for the Ad Board. In addition to Howell and Stokes-Rees, Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister—who serves as the chair of the board in his capacity as the College’s top administrator—and Ad Board Secretary John “Jay” L. Ellison will both be leaving their positions this summer. Although Rakesh Khurana has been appointed to succeed Pfister as dean of the College, administrators have yet to appoint a permanent successor to Ellison.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: May 14, 2014, at 1:02 a.m.
Nearly eight months after Harvard announced the public launch of its unprecedented $6.5 billion capital campaign, the Kennedy School of Government is preparing to launch its $500 million fundraising drive in a two-day celebration beginning Thursday.
The campaign goal represents more than seven percent of the University’s overall mission, but is only half the size of the $1 billion goal set forth by the Harvard Business School in April.
Although specific details of the campaign’s “quiet” phase—a period of gauging alumni interest and targeting specific donors that began in June 2011—will be announced Friday morning, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 confirmed in an interview in March that the campaign has already passed its halfway mark. 
The Kennedy School hopes to channel its campaign funds into recruitment and financial aid, investing in new educational technologies, research focused on more “real-world applications,” and upgrading facilities, according to Kennedy School administrators.
Of these goals, Ellwood said, the Kennedy School will prioritize “attracting the best” with increased financial aid and recruitment.
“We want to get the very best people in the world engaged in and working on public issues,” Ellwood said. “In order to attract students to come here we have to make it financially worthwhile, and in order for them to go off and follow their dreams, as opposed to trying to take a job because they have to pay off some loans.”
To accomplish its capital campaign goal of improving financial aid, the Kennedy School will continue to rely on outside donations, many of which come from people unaffiliated with the Kennedy School.
“[Our donors] very much care about our mission, or their mission, and sometimes we say that people primarily give because they care about making the world a better place,” said Iris Bohnet, academic dean of the Kennedy School. “They’re drawn to the Kennedy School not so much because they’re alumni, but because they care about development, or the environment, or gender equality, or whatever it might be.”
Many donors plan to attend the launch event on Thursday and Friday, named IDEASpHERE, in which over 100 Kennedy School professors, administrators, alumni, and prominent world leaders will give talks and lead seminars.
Felipe Calderón, the former president of Mexico, and Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the current president of Liberia, will give keynote addresses on Thursday. Both speakers are alumni of the University. Speakers for Friday include Lawrence H. Summers, former president of Harvard University.
Ellwood expressed excitement for the opportunity to showcase some of the Kennedy School’s talent at this week’s event.
"IDEASpHERE is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the many powerful ideas that are making a significant difference in the world as a result of the committed work of our faculty, scholars, alumni and students,” Ellwood said in an email. “I can't think of a better way to launch the campaign for Harvard Kennedy School."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A task force convened in April by University President Drew G. Faust has developed a series of early recommendations for preventing sexual assault on campus, including increased funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Research and a proposal that individual schools work with OSAPR and the Title IX office to incorporate more prevention education into orientation programs.
The recommendations were formally accepted by Faust in a letter Wednesday afternoon and will take effect immediately.
Former University Provost and chair of the task force Steven E. Hyman, who submitted a letter including the recommendations to Faust on Tuesday, wrote in the document that the group has met twice since its creation and that its main focus has been “how to best use the coming months” as the committee works to provide Faust with further recommendations.
In the letter, Hyman also requested funds for a survey on sexual assault to be administered by the task force and proposed the creation of a central website hosting resources for victims of sexual assault. Hyman wrote that “a critical activity” for the task force will be broad consultation with members of the Harvard community this fall.
Much of Hyman’s letter amounted to a call for the University to dedicate additional resources for prevention.
“We are concerned that moving forward, an understaffed OSAPR risks slow or ineffective responses to students who have experienced sexual assault,” Hyman wrote. “The task force asks that OSAPR be provided with whatever additional resources are necessary to carry out its role—beginning as soon as possible.”
 
In an interview on Wednesday, Hyman applauded members of the task force for moving quickly and said he felt a sense of urgency among its members.
 
“Everywhere you turn there are reminders that this is a very important and still not well addressed issue,” he said. “We are most likely to be successful with our recommendations if we really exploit this moment of attention.”
 
Hyman added, “I really want people to think hard about what will actually work. How do you intervene to decrease significantly the incidents of these obviously very life-damaging assaults? The goal is not to issue a document that makes us all feel good; the goal is to make a difference.”
 
The early recommendations come after Faust told The Crimson last week that her hope was that changes could be made by the start of the fall semester, if not by the end of this academic year.
 
“I think we are focused on making a number of efforts before the end of the school year,” she said. “Sexual assault should not exist on this campus given what we see as our most fundamental values…. It is just totally at odds with everything we believe in and want to be.”
 
“When I hear stories from individuals about [sexual assault], it is heart-rending. I think that it is also [often] difficult to figure out, once it’s happened, how to best support the individual in question, and that is our challenge,” Faust said. “That is what I think the task force needs to address first of all.”
 
Last week, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced the formation of an FAS committee charged with bringing the body up to code with a proposed University-wide sexual assault policy currently being reviewed by the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education.
Faust said last week that she was unable to comment on any specific initiatives of the policy while it was under review.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was little surprise in the 2012 edition of the longest-running high school lacrosse rivalry. Top-ranked Garden City easily defeated Manhasset in the 122nd matchup between Long Island’s most storied programs.
But in one aspect, Manhasset emerged on top. Senior defenseman Bobby Duvnjak, Inside Lacrosse’s top-ranked defensive recruit in the country, held Garden City’s best attackman—senior Devin Dwyer, Inside Lacrosse’s second-ranked offensive recruit in the country—scoreless.
“It was easy to see that Bob was something special when he used to cover me in high school,” Dwyer said. “It was tough to put up points against him.”
Just months later, Duvnjak and Dwyer would meet on the field again, alongside several other Garden City players.  This time, however, they would be on the same side, looking to add to the even older tradition of Harvard lacrosse. Nine of the 22 players who started a game for the Crimson this season hail from Long Island.
Dwyer and Duvnjak, both of whom earned first-team All-Ivy selections, are just the latest Harvard stars from the region.They joined Long Island products junior goalie Jake Gambitsky, junior long-stick midfielder Brian Fischer, senior midfielder Brian O’ Toole, and junior defenseman Stephen Jahelka.For decades, the Crimson has tapped into the region’s talent pool.
The program’s leading scorer, former Harvard attackmen Jeff Cohen ’12, hailed from Syosset, N.Y. Michael Ferrucci ’98, another Garden City alum, ranks third in the Crimson record books for career goals and points.
“[Harvard head Chris Wojcik ’96] has always joked that there’s a pipeline from Long Island to Harvard,” Jahelka said.
Along with Baltimore and upstate New York, Long Island has long been synonymous with outstanding youth and high school lacrosse.
“I started playing lacrosse when I was four years old,” Jahelka said. “My dad had a stick in my hand. That might be a baseball mitt for some kids in the Midwest, [and] that might be a football for a kid from Texas.... On Long Island...there’s always a heightened focus on lacrosse.”
Like Jahelka, Dwyer credits Long Island parents for fostering an environment conducive to elite lacrosse.
“It really just starts with the dads that really put this stuff together,” Dwyer said. “They organize teams and…the towns with the best youth programs usually show that they have the best high school teams in the country. It’s really all to those guys for teaching kids at such a young age and getting them involved in the sport, building a love for the sport.”
Dwyer’s father exemplified the community dedication to the sport, serving as an assistant coach to Garden City’s team for over 20 years. He left the team before Dwyer and his brothers arrived, but helped launch his sons’ careers on the field.
“[My father is] the reason I probably play lacrosse at this level,” Dwyer said. “He really got me involved at a young age and showed me what it would take to be a good player.”
While Long Island as a whole has been a prolific source of talent for the Crimson, Garden City in particular stands out. The public school has captured six New York State championships, and the Trojans will look to claim their third consecutive title later this year.
“People certainly move to that town simply because they want their children to play lacrosse for Garden City,” Wojcik said.
On the field, Jahelka and Fischer also starred for the Long Island powerhouse before arriving in Cambridge.
“They have a tradition of excellence and a high standard [that] they hold their players to,” Wojcik said. “They combine the excellent feeder system, [and] you have an outstanding high school program...that consistently churns out outstanding college players.”
Having multiple players from a single high school has provided a huge chemistry boost for Harvard, as Dwyer, Fischer and Jahelka were on the same team at Garden City for three years and started playing together long before that.
“When we first got [to Harvard], it was a familiar face in a really uncertain time of freshman year, kind of getting settled in and everything, and then obviously when you’re on the field,” Jahelka said. “I know what they’re going to do second nature now because I’ve seen them do it so many times in the past, and I’m sure they could say the same thing. So just playing with each other, there’s just obviously a really natural connection.”
The connection between Garden City’s lacrosse program and the Crimson extends to the coaching staff as well.  The head coaching position is endowed by former Garden City and Harvard lacrosse player Rick Frisbie ’71, who appears to have originated the relationship. Frisbie was named MVP of the ’67 Trojans and captained the Crimson during his season year. His endowment, the Frisbie Family Endowed Coach for Men’s Lacrosse, supports the head coaching position while also providing a source of funding for the team’s annual operations.
“We’ve always had a very strong tradition of Garden City alumni come to Harvard to play lacrosse, starting…[with] Rick Frisbie,” Wojcik said.
Harvard also represented an opportunity for old rivals to reconnect—prior to facing each other in high school, Dwyer and Duvnjak had played together on the same club team in seventh grade. Through the many years of playing with and against each other in Long Island, the two developed a friendship and mutual respect for each other’s game.
When the two committed to Harvard, they ensured that Long Island talent would be anchoring the team for the next four years.
“I remember talking to him whether it was via text or whatever, and we were just really excited about bringing together a great team with some great recruits coming in,” Dwyer said. “We were ready to set the foundation for Harvard lacrosse and its future, and really do great things for the program.”
