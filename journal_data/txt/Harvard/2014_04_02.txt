“The ukulele has always fascinated me because it doesn’t intimidate other people,” ukulele player and composer Jake Shimabukuro said during his workshop on March 26. My borrowed ukulele reaffirmed his statement. Hardly as long as my arm and with four strings to pluck, the miniature instrument appeared inviting. The piano has 88 keys; the guitar, six strings; the violin, the added difficulty of manipulating strings with the bow. Comparatively, the ukulele appears manageable. As the afternoon went on, however, my assumptions proved wrong.
The workshop, presented by the Office for the Arts at Harvard's Learning From Performers program, packed Cambridge Queen’s Head with scores of people: some college students and many adults carrying ukuleles in cases. The excitement in the room was palpable. Shimabukuro is renowned for his work, having been declared a musical “hero” by Rolling Stone and having topped the Billboard World Charts for his 2011 album, “Peace, Love, Ukulele.” When Shimabukuro entered sporting a lei, a testament to his Hawaiian roots, silence fell across the rows of people. Everybody knew what to expect, but I, never having touched a ukulele or viewed it as a serious instrument, didn’t. Then Shimabukuro struck his first chord. Deft strokes resonated as he vacillated between a soft melody and sudden harsh pangs. The song reached a quiet conclusion as he brushed the strings for a fading effect. The applause resounded.
 
This precise technique, which created a range of emotions and melodies, was evident in all of Shimabukuro’s other pieces. His performance of the Japanese folk song “Sakura Sakura” was replete with slight trills that expertly evoked the sound of traditional Asian instruments. “This song is about space and silence and learning how to perform the things that are happening in between the notes you play,” Shimabukuro said before he performed it, and while I listened, there was little doubt he knew how to capture the song’s intricacies. Though little flourishes within the tune gave the song variation, an overarching melody held the piece together. “I was a horrible singer,” he said jokingly, explaining that while the ukulele typically serves as an accompaniment, he uses it as his voice’s replacement. The result, evident in his rendition of “Ave Maria,” sounded like he was playing a piano—one hand moved to drive the song forward, while the other gave variation to the beat. The crescendos, placed during climactic moments, revealed the measure of control he possessed. My excitement grew as I listened, along with my respect; I wanted to try playing the ukulele.
 
Shimabukuro began his lesson by teaching beginners to pluck the string. He compared the act to placing a foot on the edge of a curb. Similar to how our feet first slowly sink and then jarringly hit the road, our thumb had to exert pressure onto the string until they slid off to create a crisp note. The execution was delicate and natural instead of forceful, a peaceful relationship between the fingers and the instrument.
 
As we learned chords and practiced “Lean on Me,” I became aware of the difficulties involved in mastering the ukulele. My left hand’s stubby fingers contorted into uncomfortable positions along the neck as I struggled to follow the tempo and press down on one fret after another. My 10-plus years of piano training had not prepared me for the dexterity required to play the ukulele. On the piano, I could stretch my hand to hit octaves and play scales in rapid succession, but at Shimabukuro’s workshop, jumping from the C to G to F and back to G proved too complicated. While I struggled to even keep up with the rest of the workshop, Shimabukuro performed his rendition of the song with flair by including a rock-style bridge between the verses. My sense of awe increased when he explained he had only used the chords we learned; the variation was a result of experimenting with the notes, something he always did to his music. “When I was a kid, I would take a chord and I would exploit it,” he said. “You learn how to make it fun.”
 
“Every time I discover something new, I feel like a little kid again,” Shimabukuro said. The sentiment resonated within me. Though I struggled in the workshop, I ended with a growing appreciation for an art. I, too, felt like a child, with wide eyes taking in all the beauty around her. Shimabukuro imparted more than his knowledge of playing an instrument to me; his workshop exemplified music’s power and impact on others by proving the emotions it expresses could be packed into anything—even a tiny instrument. As he said, “People say music is the universal language, but I like to say it’s the language of the universe.”

Emma Donoghue does not equivocate about the sort of book “Frog Music” is supposed to be. It opens with the murder of Jenny Bonnet, shot through the window of a boarding house near a 19th-century San Francisco train station. From the protagonist Blanche’s gaiters to the quirky French lullabies she and Jenny sing, Donoghue spares no detail in establishing the period setting, and she waits only a few pages to introduce the murder mystery that motivates the novel. At no point does she attempt to delude the reader into thinking he or she is reading a solemn or profound work of literature: “Frog Music” is a suspenseful mystery novel set in 1870s California, and a very accomplished one at that. Donoghue focuses on and develops those elements that most effectively propel her story—specifically, her characters, setting, and manipulated chronology—and crafts a gripping read, the sort of 400-page novel one might very well finish in a single sitting.
  By commencing the novel with Jenny’s murder—a wise choice in that it immediately engages the reader—Donoghue has confined herself to utilizing a nontraditional chronology to explain the events that precipitate Jenny’s demise alongside the effects of the event. She thus proceeds along two separate timelines, alternating sections of each throughout the book. One proceeds from Blanche and Jenny’s first encounter, and the other details Blanche’s life following Jenny’s death. By juxtaposing these two storylines, Donoghue is able to reveal bits and pieces of the overall trail while simultaneously introducing additional mystery, a technique that maintains the book’s suspense throughout its length. While the alternating plotlines might have become confusing in the hands of an inferior writer, Donoghue executes the transitions deftly, such that the reader never loses track of either thread.
  Within this scaffold, Donoghue crafts a cast of distinctive and often powerfully sympathetic characters who constitute the novel’s emotional core. Jenny, the cross-dressing, bike-riding frog catcher, is immediately likeable, but it is the surprising protagonist, Blanche, who most effectively captures the reader’s sympathy. She is a dancer and a prostitute, a fact that Donoghue makes clear from the novel’s very beginning; simultaneously, Blanche is so likeable and emotionally resonant that she would easily overcome any associated prejudices a reader might have to become an unequivocally successful protagonist. Donoghue achieves this connection between protagonist and reader most effectively through her portrayal of Blanche’s relationship with her son, whom she rescues from an abhorrent “baby farm” and who is later stolen from her shortly before Jenny’s death. Her reaction to the baby farm is particularly moving, as when she dreams “she was back in that house on Folsom holding a pillow and running from crib to crib, pressing it down on each face, leaning hard, snuffing out these abominable half-lives.” This uncomfortably realistic reaction to the situation in which Blanche found her son, as well as their developing closeness and the brutality of their separation, all serve to render Blanche in a potently sympathetic light. She becomes a particularly effective protagonist because she is, ultimately, so human.
  But a likeable protagonist alone cannot carry a period mystery, and where “Frog Music” truly shines is in its nuanced, impeccably researched depiction of 1870s San Francisco. Donoghue depicts the city during both an oppressive heat wave and the peak of the smallpox epidemic, and in representing each she conveys the extreme pressures they exerted on the people who suffered through them. She describes one smallpox victim as having “hands…embroidered with huge rubies each half an inch across, globes so thick on his right lid that he can’t open his eye.” Blanche wonders if he will “burst apart in the end, dynamited from inside his own skin.” Even before any major character is afflicted with the illness, smallpox looms ominous; in her vivid description of the character who eventually contracts it, Donoghue represents the terrifying impact of the disease on the San Franciscan population. In other facets, too, Donoghue paints an immersive and realistic setting, from the fragments of French spoken by Blanche and others throughout the novel to the snatches of songs she periodically includes. She has clearly devoted an enormous amount of time to researching her novel, and her efforts pay off fabulously in the entrancing setting she is able to craft.
  Thus, though “Frog Music” will not necessarily help Donoghue win the Nobel Prize in Literature, she has still created an absolutely successful period mystery. “Frog Music” is engaging, consistently suspenseful, and compelling; though an undemanding read, it is nevertheless deeply affecting, particularly on account of the sympathy the main characters demand. From its first few pages, “Frog Music” engages readers completely and immerses them in its beautifully detailed, well-developed world.

Playwright Martin Mcdonagh, creator of famed works such as “In Bruges” and “Seven Psychopaths,” will have one of his plays put on stage in the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “The Pillowman,” running from April 4 to 12 on the Loeb Mainstage.
  Director Lily R. Glimcher ’14 blurs the lines between fiction and reality as she tells the story of Katurian (Benjamin J. Lorenz ’14), a fiction writer living in a totalitarian police state. Katurian undergoes questioning by two ruthlessly cruel yet playful detectives when the gruesome contents of his short stories become reality in the form of bizarre child murders occurring within the town. Such a show boasts a story of “visceral danger” and a script that is “articulate, quick, and smart,” Glimcher says.
 As a leading actor in the show, Lorenz remarks on just how multifaceted McDonagh’s creation has proven to be. “The script is smart, playful, scary, and heartbreaking from start to finish,” Lorenz says. “Hopefully we can bring it to life honestly and interestingly.”
  Glimcher and her team accomplish this feat through a production whose stories are integrated within the play’s larger narrative as spoken word narrations and reenactments of Katurian’s short works. Glimcher, however, adds her own personal touch to these depictions of Katurian’s stories through puppeteering.“The puppets have definitely been an exciting challenge,” says Glimcher. “I knew very little about puppetry before I started this project and have learned so much over the past few months.”
  In addition to the contents of the play itself, the work put in by both cast and crew demonstrate that “The Pillowman,” above all else, strives to highlight the value of storytelling and the immense power it has over our lives, as Taylor A. Cressler ’14, who will play Katurian’s brain-damaged brother Michal, asserts. “For me, the power of storytelling resonates the most in this show. The idea that something as simple as a story can cause significant events is very jarring for any kind of storyteller.”

How would you explain your home country to a group of foreigners in 10 days? Would you show them the good, the bad, and the ugly? If an American Democrat, would you take a group of visitors to a Tea Party rally, or would you try to pretend such events are irrelevant?
 
These are difficult questions to answer. Now imagine trying to explain Israel, one of the most unique countries in the world, to 50 visiting Harvard undergraduates who have no real connection to the country. Six Israeli undergraduate students, Zaki Djemal ‘15, Sharon Stovetsky ’15, Yael Stovetsky ’16, Yoav Schaefer ’17, Gal Wachtel ’17, and Nuseir Yassin ’14, undertook this task over spring break, leading and organizing the Harvard College Israel Trek in an effort to guide their peers through the complexity that is Israel. We had the lucky opportunity to be a part of this journey.
 
It would have been easy for these six Israeli organizers to show us participants a particular view of life in Israel: the striking beauty of Jerusalem, the weightless fun of the Dead Sea, the intensity of high-tech in Tel Aviv. Indeed, there is much to marvel at and to celebrate within the story of this nation. In our first weekend alone, we were enveloped by the country’s exceptional energy as Purim revelers welcomed us into their celebrations. However, the vitality of this country coexists with an intense complexity. Our organizers were intent on exposing our group to a nuanced Israel. Instead of relying on sterile textbook answers, our organizers invited us right into their homes, allowing us to question and learn from their own personal stories and those of their broad-ranging contacts and friends.
On our first night in Jerusalem, our entire group had a home cooked Shabbat dinner at the residence of  Zaki Djemal  ’15 in which we were taught the customs of Shabbat from a number of different Jewish practices. A few days later, we visited the Arab-Israeli village of Arraba, home to Nuseir Yassin ‘14. There, we had dinner with members of the community who spoke to us about their experiences growing up as a minority in Israel. After a night spent dancing dabke with them, we emerged with a host of new friends as well as new voices to add to our rapidly expanding volume of Israeli narratives.
 
Our trek leaders’ commitment to showing us their country without any window dressing certainly did not come without pain on their end, as they confronted some troubling aspects of Israel’s past and present alongside us. Given their dedication to honest dialogue, we as participants were particularly frustrated when we were confronted with a flurry of negative press responding to our visit to Ramallah halfway through the trip. Bloggers found a tweeted picture of our trip featuring our group in front of Yasser Arafat’s marble grave and responded to it as if it spoke to our entire experience. Some commentators praised our trek for uniquely trying to show a group of visiting undergraduates a broad perspective that included a visit to Ramallah. But many others criticized our trip organizers for having us visit the grave of a terrorist.
 
This incident was upsetting, as it ignored the personal effort and intense dedication of our organizers to create a diverse experience for us. And yet, though saddening, the polarized media reaction actually exhibited the importance of their efforts. In reality, our day in the West Bank exposed us to an extremely wide political spectrum. We started our day in a Jewish settlement speaking to a Rabbi about his perceived religious right to a home on that plot of land. A mere two hours later, we met with leading members of Fatah to discuss the history of their campaign to create a Palestinian state. We ended the visit eating dinner with friends of one of our leaders from Ramallah who presented many challenging and provocative viewpoints on the conflict. At the end of the day, we understood more than ever why the famous Israeli author, Amos Oz, describes the conflict as a tragic “clash of right and right.” 
 
Although this trip was a rare opportunity, we believe that the mindset our organizers embodied—open to sharing and seeking out different opinions—could reinvigorate engagement surrounding key issues on campus. Here, amid the hundreds of events hosted on campus every day, we often stick to our pet causes and fail to engage with views that may challenge our own, shrugging off causes we have no immediate connection to. We’re inundated with information about Harvard’s negotiations with labor unions, the annexation of Crimea, and divestment from fossil fuels but we often don’t take the time to understand the motives behind these movements and the issues that are at stake. 
 
Of course, it’s impossible to engage with every issue that falls outside of our understanding. But perhaps if we are committed to asking one uncomfortable question each day, we can better draw on the wealth of perspectives that each of us brings to this campus. On the other hand, in order to be true ambassadors of our backgrounds, we must be committed to inviting these open dialogues and—sometimes—critiques. If our Israeli organizers could take on this challenge in representing their dynamic and fraught home country, we too should be emboldened to share our stories over dinner in the comfort of our dining halls. We may never lead 50 foreigners to our hometowns, but we can all gain from broaching foreign subjects, and exposing our presumptions to scrutiny.

 “This shirt? Oh, it was only 500 bucks!”
The smile on my cousin’s face confused me at first. 500 bucks? That’s a lot of money! But though my cousin had assumed my lingo, he wasn’t referring to American dollars. His pride made much more sense when I did the conversion – at 62 rupees a dollar, his brand-name shirt put him back a mere 8 dollars.
I often find myself shocked, delighted, and slightly guilty when I hear the exponentially cheaper prices of almost anything in India. Usually, clothing and tailoring services top the list, but it’s not uncommon to see food, electronics, and other souvenirs marked down tremendously. And this is before the haggling begins. 
Not everything in India is getting cheaper, however. Cities across India are experiencing rapid growth, with massive malls boasting international brands and roads filling with luxury cars. These international retailers cater to the Indian elite, a faction that has been growing due to India’s rapid economic growth. On top of this, the car dealers raise their prices because of India’s extremely high taxes (up to 110 percent!) on imported luxury cars. It goes without saying—if you want a BMW in India, you have to be willing to shell out a lot of money.
And a lot of people have been buying BMWs. 
Don’t get me wrong—there’s nothing wrong with spending your hard-earned money on luxury goods if you can afford it. It may even be healthy for India; frequent purchases of expensive goods are indicative of India’s continuing growth, encouraging trade and increasing competition despite the government’s efforts to curtail international access. But I find it hard to rationalize the scene of a Mercedes racing past an auto rickshaw on the streets of Mumbai.
India’s decrepit infrastructure, malnutrition, and poverty desperately need some attention. Is it really necessary to spend so much money on fast cars?
The Indian education system only serves to reinforce this attitude towards money. With a majority of schools focusing on business, science, and math, everyone knows about the stereotypical Indian education track. But this stereotype is self-reinforcing, too. Not everyone who studies medicine, engineering, or business is going to be successful, but the “successful” people—meaning most people consider them successful—are typically doctors, engineers, and managers.
Those successful people then buy the flashy cars and display their success, encouraging others to follow in their footsteps. Thus, the road to success, a crucial social factor in a developing country like India, has become almost codified. Yet, few resources exist to break people out of the cycle of poverty. In the last two decades, India has become more unequal, with the top 10 percent of wage earners now making more than 12 times the amount of the bottom 10 percent. 
There’s an attitude change that needs to take place. Reducing income disparity is not just good for those at the lower end of the earning spectrum—it’s good for everyone. The current disparities in socioeconomic status that are so openly displayed is especially concerning. The wealthy are becoming an ultra-conspicuous, ultra-exclusive group that has the potential to help solve many of India’s issues, but hasn’t. By buying expensive goods and then throwing these items in other people’s faces, the wealthy are dissociating themselves from their fellow countrymen, whom they should absolutely support or at least provide guidance to.
Making the difference in socioeconomic statuses more explicit also serves to justify the behavior of the wealthy—in order to become a part of that group, you have to drive the expensive cars really fast around the city or else you won’t be recognized. It’s a problem inherent to how the system is perceived. 
I’m not saying that no one should buy BMWs until the day that poverty is eradicated. But there should be more opportunity available for social mobility at the very least.
Throwing money at these problems will have a limited impact, and working through the government is probably counterproductive given its record of corruption. Instead, the wealthy should empower different groups, and especially the youth, to realize their potential by establishing training programs, camps, scholarships, and opportunities for people to be exposed to the growth of India. Though these activities may already be taking place in India, they should be expanded greatly as to increase their reach and impact. India’s growth should not be limited to a privileged few—by helping others reap the benefits of economic growth (even if it has slowed), the wealthy are realizing their own potential as leaders of a new, exciting India. But as leaders, they must act responsibly and with care. 
When in India, I had a conversation with a well-off businessman who told me he was going to hire a guy to shine his shoes as a way of helping him make more money. I want to make this clear: getting people to shine your shoes is not helping them. Teaching them, guiding them to opportunity, and finding ways to have them realize their potential is helping them. The wealthy are in a position to do this. The first step requires an attitude change, and I can only hope that will happen soon.

A recent controversy at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where a student recorded a lecturer lambasting the Republican Party, has led faculty to draft a policy regarding video recordings at the college. The new resolution—unanimously adopted by Whitewater’s Faculty Summit—institutes a university-wide ban on video recording. We respect the right of classroom professors to guarantee freedom of expression without fear of public redistribution, but feel that regulation is best left to individual professors, rather than school-wide policies. 
Expanding on an existing policy that allows faculty members to forbid students the use of tape recorders by students, the new resolution now prohibits "the recording of class and other curricular activities without the express permission of the instructor and notification to all students in the class."
The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater is not the only institution of higher education that has recently come under fire regarding the recording and redistribution of classroom speech by students. In December, officials at the University of Colorado at Boulder cited fears of such videotaping to justify their decision to discipline a sociology professor over a classroom skit on prostitution.
Freedom of expression in the classroom--both for students and for faculty—is crucial to learning. Especially in smaller seminar classes, safety from surreptitious recording can allow students to speak more freely about more controversial subjects and opinions. Professors in these seminar classes should feel comfortable sharing more in-depth thoughts without fear of their words being publicly broadcasted and taken out of context. Honest discussions in small group settings can only occur when students and professors can share ideas in an open environment free from the prospect of being held accountable in a public setting.
Yet because recording can aid students in the learning process, especially in large lecture classes, higher education institutions should not make the mistake of banning video recording altogether. While the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater’s fear of leaked recordings reflecting poorly on its institution is understandable, it is denying its students an additional avenue to learn. Recording of faculty speech can also, on rare occasions, help students hold their professors accountable for their lectures and give students credibility in their complaints.
Freedom to set their own recording policies would allow professors either to guarantee the privacy of unrecorded expression, or to allow students to derive the obvious benefits from recording. Faculty can better assess the needs of their individual classrooms, and should therefore be trusted to set policy for video recording in those classrooms.

A crowded field of Democratic candidates seeks the corner office in Massachusetts this fall—all of them accomplished, all with left-leaning policies. So a progressive voter might be forgiven for giving the contenders a cursory glance and concluding that one is as good as the next.
But for those committed to progressive goals—to making health care accessible and affordable, to eradicating poverty, and to ensuring a quality education for all children regardless of race or class—only one candidate possesses both the moral commitment and the management experience to realize these long-held dreams.
That candidate is Don Berwick ’68.
Berwick does not come from politics—he was a pediatrician first, trained at Harvard Medical School, where he also taught for many years (and where I met him in a course he co-taught on health care quality). His philosophy owes much to medicine’s most noble ideals of service. 
In 2010, when Obama appointed him to run Medicare and Medicaid, he brought a sign to place on his desk as a reminder of what should guide his decisions. It read simply, “How will it help the patient?” 
When asked what he believes government should do, he often invokes a Hubert Humphrey quote: “The moral test of a government is how it treats those who are at the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.” And he has a concise response to a question about his plans for tackling poverty: “End it.”
All this is well and good—and Berwick is no doubt the most committed progressive running for the Democratic nomination: He is the only one, for instance, to endorse a Medicare-for-all health care system in Massachusetts. Were it just his philosophy, though, I wouldn’t be writing this. But Berwick also possesses a gift far rarer: the ability to lead and change large organizations.
He has shown this amply in health care, where as founder and CEO of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, he crusaded to introduce quality improvement methods from high performing industries such as manufacturing—efforts credited with saving thousands of lives. Indeed, his tireless work helped bring an entire medical culture to the understanding that health care needed to do better by its patients.
In recognition of this vision and efficacy, President Obama named him to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services—putting him in charge of a budget larger than the Pentagon’s. Though he was pilloried, and eventually blocked, by Senate Republicans for, among other things, having once praised the UK’s National Health Service (indeed, Glenn Beck called him the “second most dangerous man in America”), his brief tenure atop the sprawling bureaucracy was transformative. 
He helped change an agency often characterized by sluggish processes and unresponsiveness into one focused on constant improvement, speed, and a relentless focus on the welfare of its millions of beneficiaries. He launched efforts to improve care for patients following hospital discharge and to combat medical errors such as those resulting in hospital-acquired infections. He pushed staffers to leave headquarters and visit providers and patients in the field, and he did so himself. As Health Affairs noted, “It’s difficult to find any health care stakeholder groups that express anything less than glowing praise for Berwick’s performance at CMS.”
In short, Berwick began to make this bureaucratic behemoth with a budget an order of magnitude larger than that of Massachusetts into a governmental ideal: compassionate, efficient, and effective. I believe he would do the same with government in Massachusetts—the same thing he’s been doing for decades—transform cultures and organizations for the benefit of those they serve. 
There’s one other thing that compels me to voice such strong support for Dr. Berwick’s candidacy, and it’s a logic not confined to Massachusetts’ borders. Not for decades has the need for effective, efficient, and compassionate government been so apparent. Income inequality is widening, and industries that once provided middle-class incomes are disappearing, abandoning millions of Americans to bleak employment prospects. It has been 50 years exactly since this nation declared war on poverty, and still, one out of seven Americans struggles on in its clutches.
But this too is true: Never in our nation’s history has government been so distrusted. Half a century ago, three in four Americans said they trusted the federal government; today, just one in five does. This state and this country need government to be its best self, but they also need to see that such a self is truly possible. So if progressive government is to flourish in this state, it needs a leader who will not only direct governmental energies against poverty, illness, and racism, but who will do so tirelessly and effectively.
John Winthrop, one of the first governors of Massachusetts, famously shared his dream that the then colony would be an example that people elsewhere might look on, and say of their own lands, “May the Lord make it like that of New England.” In its long and storied history, Massachusetts has so often lived up to that dream—in education, gay rights, and environmental stewardship. 
With the right leadership—Don Berwick’s brand of leadership—it can continue to do so.

To the Editor:
The Crimson’s coverage of the recent teaching forum for graduate students in the March 13 article, “Section Size, Teaching Concerns Center of Latest Graduate Student Forum,” included remarks by Professor Robert A. Lue describing the financial obstacles to reducing section sizes.
As a graduate student and teaching fellow keen to improve both the quality of undergraduate education and the working conditions of graduate students, I appreciate this important concern. Yet, I take issue with Professor Lue’s claim that “the fiscal reality we are in” is the source of these obstacles.
My disagreement stems from information covered in another Crimson article announcing a massive expansion in the size of the Bok Center, which Professor Lue directs. According to that article, the current FAS capital campaign has earmarked $150 million for “Leading in Learning,” split between the Bok Center, the SEAS Learning Incubator, and HarvardX. It would seem that “the fiscal reality” is that FAS is earmarking a huge sum of money for pedagogy at Harvard. Professor Lue would speak more accurately if he referred to the financial obstacles to reducing section sizes as a question of “fiscal priorities.”
A back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me $150 million would pay for tens of thousands of sections. In 2009, when FAS cut eight to 10 percent of section leaders, they aimed to save $2 million—1.3 percent of the “Leading in Learning” fund.
None of this suggests that the financial obstacles are insurmountable. Rather, it suggests that section size should form part of a broader conversation about pedagogical and fiscal priorities at Harvard. I would urge not only Professor Lue but also all members of the Harvard community to engage in that conversation, recognizing that how Harvard spends its money has a direct impact on the quality of undergraduate students’ education and graduate student employment.

American R&B and soul artist Janelle Monáe will be recognized by two campus organizations for her professional achievements and contributions to ongoing conversations on gender and race.
 
The Harvard College Women’s Center announced over the weekend that Monáe had been honored with its inaugural Award for Achievement in Arts and Media. The Harvard Black Men’s Forum also honored Monáe earlier in the month, naming her its 2014 Woman of the Year and selecting her as keynote speaker for the organization’s annual Celebration of Black Women Gala.
 
Monáe’s recognition at the College coincides with the announcement earlier this month that the singer will be the headlining act at this year’s Yardfest.
 
The Women’s Center, the Black Men’s Forum, the College Events Board, and the Harvard Concert Commission have been in discussions since early fall to coordinate Monáe’s planned visit to Harvard in April, according to the Assistant Dean of Student Life for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Emelyn A. dela Peña.
 
“Ms. Monáe is an ideal artist to cross the boundaries for all three events given her prominence as an artist, her focus on strong women, and her commentary on the African American community through her music,” dela Peña wrote in an email.
 
Vice President of the Black Men’s Forum Fadhal A. Moore ’15 agreed that Monáe was a great choice for each of the organizations to recognize.
 
“It was perfect timing,” Moore said, citing Monáe’s strong performance skills, social commentary, and increased media exposure following an album release last year and a collaboration with the band Fun on the Grammy award-winning song “We Are Young” as the basis for the groups’ decisions.
 
Moore said that he did not think there would be any “political problems” with Monáe’s visit to Harvard, in contrast to the student and administrative protest following last year’s selection of the rapper Tyga to headline Yardfest.
 
Though Monáe’s recognition on campus occurs only a few weeks after campaigns such as “I, Too, Am Harvard” made national headlines and administrators spoke in favor of institutional support for minority groups, Moore said that it is just a “fortunate coincidence” that Monáe fit into the ongoing narrative about race on campus.
 
 “These campaigns are relatively new or have just come to light,” Moore said. “Coordination with Janelle has been going on for a long time.”
 
Both groups will recognize Monáe on April 14, the day after Yardfest. In the early afternoon, the Women’s Center will host a student conversation with Monáe in Fong Auditorium on gender and music, which will be followed by a presentation of Monáe’s award. In the evening, she will serve as keynote speaker at the 20th annual Celebration of Black Women Gala hosted by the Black Men’s Forum.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
UPDATED: April 2, 2013, at 2:51 a.m.
Intellectual property lawyer Morgan Chu, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1976, will preside over Harvard’s Board of Overseers—the University’s second-highest governing body—for the 2014-2015 academic year as its new president, the University announced in a press release on Tuesday.
Walter Clair ’77, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who also holds degrees from the Medical School and School of Public Health, will join Chu as vice president.
The 30 members of the Board of Overseers work in conjunction with the Harvard Corporation, Harvard’s highest governing board. The Corporation, a much smaller committee with a roster of only 13 members, must obtain the Overseers’ approval for many major decisions, including the choice of University president as well as nominations to the Corporation.
“Every single member and the Board as a whole does our utmost to protect what is best at Harvard, while also moving us all forward as one Harvard, transcending the traditional boundaries,” said Chu, who is the brother of former Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.
In a statement, University President Drew G. Faust said that Chu and Clair “embody the board’s constant concern for understanding what helps Harvard thrive, challenging us to innovate and do still better, and encouraging us to think across traditional boundaries to see the University as a whole.”
Chu, currently a partner and previously a co-managing partner from 1997 to 2003 at Irell & Manella LLP in Los Angeles, said that he was “very humbled by the honor.”
“I know I am a temporary steward for an extraordinary institution,” he added.
The Board of Overseers’ new leaders, like many of the Overseers, occupy prominent positions in their fields. Chu was named one of the decade’s 40 most influential lawyers in 2010 as well as one of the top 10 trial lawyers by the National Law Journal. Although a high school dropout, Chu earned five degrees by age 25, including a B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from UCLA, a M.S.L. from Yale, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School, where he endowed a professorship in May 2013.
A nationally recognized cardiological specialist, Clair is an associate professor of medicine and medical director of cardiac electrophysiology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, where he received awards for teaching and a commitment to diversity.
As Overseers, Chu and Clair have served on several Harvard committees. Both sit on the Board of Overseers’ Committee on Schools, the College, and Continuing Education, of which Clair is the chair. In addition to working on various committees on the social sciences across the University, Chu is a member of the Board’s executive committee.
“Serving on the various committees as well as the Board of Overseers, it is just a way of paying it forward in a sense,” Chu said. “I always considered myself to be extraordinarily fortunate to learn from the best professors and the best fellow students while I was at Harvard.”
Clair also served on the Board’s committee on natural and applied sciences and the Corporation and Board’s joint committee on alumni affairs and development. He was an elected director of the Harvard Alumni Association from 2002 to 2005 and chairman of the HAA’s awards committee from 2005 to 2007.
Both Chu and Clair—who are each serving the last year of their six-year terms on the Board—will step into their new roles after this year's Commencement ceremonies. They will succeed Pomona College President David W. Oxtoby ’72 and concert violinist Lynn Chang ’75, respectively.
“We follow in the footsteps of many people, not only in the last five years, but many before us that have done an outstanding job,” Chu said. “Hopefully, we’ll do a decent job.”

From the unfortunate reply-all mishap to the fear of messages living in an inbox forever, the irreversible act of pressing the send button on an email is terrifying to many.

From the unfortunate reply-all mishap to the fear of messages living in an inbox forever, the irreversible act of pressing the send button on an email is terrifying to many.
From the unfortunate reply-all mishap to the fear of messages living in an inbox forever, the irreversible act of pressing the send button on an email is terrifying to many.
In response to this fear, Harvard Law School students Lindsay Lin and David S. Gobaud have created Pluto Mail, a free service that allows users to unsend, edit, and auto-expire emails after pressing send.
“I don’t think anyone has done this before the way we have done it,” Gobaud said. “It let's you keep using your same email address, your same email client, and the receivers do not have to be using the service.”
According to Gobaud and Lin, the system appears to have a large market since many want to avoid grammar errors and reply-all disasters. They also noted, however, that the system may benefit corporations looking to improve their email protection policies by automatically deleting old emails.
“There’s a niche of people out there in the world who really care about security and they want their emails to expire,” Lin said. “We fulfill that niche.”
Currently in the private beta stage, Pluto Mail has 600 users and many more on the waitlist. Gobaud and Lin hope to create a Google Chrome plug-in to make the system more user-friendly before releasing Pluto Mail to the public.
Pluto Mail’s development, incorporation, and design was primarily done in the duo’s dorm over the past few months, according to Gobaud.
“Everything that you see on the website was created by us,” he said.
Both Lin and Gobaud have an interest in entrepreneurship and a technical background. Gobaud, who graduated from Stanford in 2010 with a degree in computer science, worked for Google and launched a software automation team at the White House before coming to the Law School.
Lin, who graduated from the University of Virginia in 2012 with a degree in mathematics, began creating websites in grade school and helped with the website’s design. After spending time in the investment banking division at Lazard before coming to the Law School, Lin has also helped the duo navigate discussions about raising capital.
As Pluto Mail continues to pick up users and attention, Lin and Gobaud have started looking for software engineers to add to their team.
The co-founders have received the help of the Harvard Innovation Lab, where they have met with venture capital firms and received the help of mentors. However Lin and Gobaud have decided not to raise capital yet, opting to self-finance the project until venture capital is absolutely necessary.
According to Gobaud, Pluto Mail has also enlisted the help of the Harvard Law Entrepreneurship Project, which is currently researching a legal question for them, and the Law School’s large alumni network, which they have used to seek mentorship and advice.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though Mark E. Zuckerberg never received his diploma from Harvard College, the Admissions Office called upon him this year to be part of an admitted students video posted to the Class of 2018 admit page.
The video, which is available to the 2,023 students admitted to the Class of 2018 through both the early action and regular decision programs, features Zuckerberg welcoming students to the College and inviting them to join the Class of 2018 Facebook group.
“[The Admissions Office] thought it would be cool if I gave you the news, so congrats, you’ve been accepted to Harvard,” Zuckerberg said in the video, adding shortly thereafter, “I hope you go to Harvard and they hope you stay a bit longer than I did.”
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said that his office thought it would be a “fantastic” idea for admitted students to be greeted by Zuckerberg when they logged onto the Class of 2018 page.
“There are other places that have Facebook groups for admitted students, but there’s no place in the world where the Facebook group is greeted by Mark Zuckerberg,” Fitzsimmons said.
Currently, the official Class of 2018 Facebook group has about 1,600 members, some of whom are employees of the Office of Admissions, student representatives in other classes, or professors. Fitzsimmons called the group so far a “huge hit.”
Embree N. Thompson from Owings Mill, Md., who was admitted last week under the regular decision program, said that she was excited to see Zuckerberg in the admitted students video.
“[The video] definitely grabs your attention and obviously encourages you to matriculate at Harvard,” Thompson said. “If Harvard can do that much for him, they can do that much for you.”
Erin Y. Wang from Rochester, N.Y., said that she was also amused by Zuckerberg’s appearance.
“It was actually kind of funny,” Wang said. “He was like, ‘Oh, hopefully you will decide to stay for longer than I did.”
She also said that the class Facebook group has so far been useful for helping her learn more about Harvard.
“I really love it,” Wang said. “I don’t know when these groups started becoming popular, but they are very helpful, and a lot of kids ask questions that address the concerns of other people.”
Both admitted students and members of the Office of Admissions noted how the group can play an important role in providing information to prospective students before the College’s official admitted students weekend, Visitas, which typically takes place in the last week of April. Fitzsimmons said the significance of social media outreach increased in importance last year after Visitas weekend was cancelled due to the Boston Marathon bombings.
“One could argue that by having the Facebook group last year, both for the early action and regular action admits, it certainly must have had some measurable, perhaps significant effect on the yield,” Fitzsimmons said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a month after the release of a University report detailing Harvard’s recent history with access of electronic communications, Secretary of the Administrative Board John “Jay” L. Ellison said that the Ad Board has not searched a student email account in a case since he joined it in fall 2002 and likely will not in the future.
“We’ve never done a search of a student’s [email] unless a student has asked us to or they presented information,” Ellison said last week. “I can’t envision a case where we would.”
Interim Dean of the College Donald H. Pfister confirmed that the Ad Board has not searched any student accounts in his time chairing the body this academic year.
The University’s electronic communications task force that released the report in late February also proposed a new University-wide privacy policy that would govern the approval and reporting requirements associated with any searches of electronic communications. The task force was convened by University President Drew G. Faust last spring following revelations that administrators had secretly searched the email accounts of resident deans after internal Ad Board communications related to the Government 1310 cheating investigation were leaked to the media.
In the fallout of last spring’s email search controversy, some students expressed concern that student email accounts might also have been searched without notification. At the time, the Undergraduate Council asked for administrative clarification of the policy governing the privacy of student email.
The task force’s report mentions the Ad Board just one time, writing that there have been “occasions when access [to electronic information] was sought in connection with academic misconduct investigations involving students pursuant to Administrative Board actions.” According to the report, these actions “appear to have been carried out with consent.”
Ellison said that students have voluntarily brought email evidence to the Ad Board, either printed out in paper form or by forwarding a message, but that administrators have never, in his time there, gone through the process of searching a student’s account for evidence in a case, nor would they.
Even in a peer dispute case, Ellison said, the Ad Board would only look at the contents of an email message if one of the students presented the Board with the material. In such a case, both students involved would have a chance to view the message and respond to it.
Ellison wrote later in an email that he has “no idea what the report is talking about” with regard to the Ad Board seeking electronic information beyond when students have voluntarily provided that information to the body. He wrote that in one previous case, he asked the student or students involved if administrators could look at electronic material, but only at the information that the student or students “wanted [administrators] to see” with “express permission.”
Ellison said he could only envision a possible search of student emails in cases involving the safety of an individual or of the wider community. Pfister added that the only situation in which he thought that administrators would even discuss a search is if a student went missing.
The proposed University-wide policy released with the report stipulates that the search of a student account would require the authorization of the dean of the appropriate school or the dean’s designee. The policy further states that “[a]ll reasonable efforts should be made to give notice at the time of access or soon thereafter as reasonably possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most Harvard students, Winthrop Square Park is just a small patch of grass wedged between Peet’s Coffee and JFK St. However, this small plot of land has played an outsized role not only in American history, but also in the current controversy over development in Harvard Square.
According to the Cambridge Historical Commission, Cambridge—then called Newtowne—was founded at the current site of the park in 1630 by Governor John Winthrop and Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley. In the mid 1890s, prominent architect Frederick Law Olmsted’s firm helped develop the space, after it was enclosed as a public park in 1834. According to some Cambridge citizens, that makes it the oldest such park in the country.
But this year, a new proposal from developer Raj Dhanda to build a three-story addition on the 57 JFK St. building next door has brought renewed attention—and controversy—to the park.
On Thursday, Dhanda will go before the Cambridge Historical Commission for the third time to submit revised plans of his proposal to add three stories of residential micro-units to the existing Galeria building, which sits adjacent to Winthrop Park and currently houses businesses including Staples, Yogurtland, and Shake Shack.
However, Katherine D. Dukakis—the Cambridge-born wife of former Governor Michael S. Dukakis—worries that the proposal will have a negative impact on the park. She first became involved with the park as a member of the Public Space Partnerships, which helped rehabilitate the space after it had fallen into disrepair in the 1980s.
“It was just awful before and there’s a real difference and we just don’t want to see that program destroy the park with no light because there’ll be shadows and no air,” Dukakis said.
“We have to get to the powers that be in Cambridge and make sure that that place is saved.”
Dukakis is not the only one concerned about the development. Kari Kuelzer, the general manager and co-owner of Grendel’s Den restaurant, is the current president of the Winthrop Park Trust, a private-public partnership whose mission is to “to protect and preserve the park,” according to Kuelzer.
“The preservation of the park is mostly keeping it in the condition in which it was conceived,” Kuelzer said. “The proposed development would put a significant portion of the park in the shade...and make it extremely challenging for the grass to grow.”
Additionally, some critics say, the proposed development does not fit in with the rest of Harvard Square.
“If something is to happen it has to respect the park and respect the context,” James M. Williamson, a longtime resident of Cambridge and community activist, said.
However, according to Dhandha, the updated proposal will better blend in with the surrounding area.
“One of the things we saw at the first and second meetings was concern that the addition and existing stories [of the building] did not connect with each other, so we made a very big effort to integrate the old and new in terms of facade design and materials,” Dhanda said.
In the revised proposal, the corner of the residential addition would have two, instead of three stories, to minimize the building’s profile. It also includes a balcony with a planter and trees that Dhanda thinks will visually complement the nearby park.
For Williamson, the changes are not enough.
“Now somebody comes along and wants to put a cheap three-story addition on an already pretty atrocious building,” Williamson said. “If you look at his most recent revised plan...it’s not a change really much at all. He’s not getting the message.”
Dhanda is hopeful that his new plans will get approved on Thursday at the Cambridge Historical Commission hearing, after which his next step in development would be to seek a special permit from the Cambridge Planning Board.
“I know some people have opposition to almost any development in Harvard Square, but I think the Historical Committee has commented at the last meeting that they agree this should be a project. And I think that was a major step,” Dhanda said.
However, many activists said they are not completely opposed to development.
“One could imagine a building that would be complimentary,” Williamson said. “This ain’t it.”
Dukakis noted that the height of the proposed addition was prohibitive.
“I think anything beyond one floor would be too much and I’m sure that most of the others are feeling the same way,” Dukakis said.
As the Historical Commission prepares to discuss the addition for the third time, opponents of the project are confident that Dhanda will not get the certificate of appropriateness necessary to move on.
“I think they’d really be going against the tide if they approved it,” G. Pebble Gifford, the former president of the Harvard Square Defense Fund said. “I doubt they’re going to drag it out much more after this.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty Council voted to expel three undergraduates from the College in February, all of whom were charged with violating the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ rules on physical violence, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith announced at the monthly Faculty meeting on Tuesday.
Two of the students were found to have violated three additional rules, including those regarding drugs and alcohol, firearms, and use of University resources. On Feb. 5, a unanimous vote of the 15-person Council expelled the two students. At the same meeting, the Council voted 14 in favor, with one abstention, to expel the third student.
Smith did not name any of the three students, all of whom have been notified of their expulsions.
According to the Harvard College Handbook for Students, “Students are expected to avoid all physical conflicts, confrontations, and altercations unless their own safety or that of another is at extreme jeopardy.”
FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal declined to identify the last time a student was expelled, prior to Feb. 5.
Expulsion, the most extreme disciplinary action possible for students enrolled in the College, “signifies that the student is no longer welcome in the community,” according to the handbook. Once a student is expelled, that individual may never be readmitted and restored to good standing.
 
A vote by the Faculty Council is required for a student to be expelled. The student’s case must first be heard by the Administrative Board, which must vote both to require the student to withdraw from the College and to recommend to the Faculty Council that the student be expelled.
 
Members of the FAS unanimously voted in Oct. 2009 to reform the system by which a student is dismissed and expelled. Prior to that vote, the entire Faculty body would weigh in on such cases. A committee that began reviewing the Ad Board’s policies in Nov. 2007 originally suggested that the Faculty Council be given the authority to issue expulsions and dismissals as part of a larger set of reforms to the disciplinary process.
 
At December’s Faculty meeting, Smith announced that the Faculty Council had voted to dismiss a student for "multiple incidents of serious and persistent unwanted sexual contact.” Dismissal, which follows the same process as expulsion from the Ad Board to the Council, ends a student’s affiliation with the University, but with the possibility of eventual readmission.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 2, 2013, at 3:34 a.m.
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences raised concerns about how frequently students would be required to make an affirmation of integrity under an updated proposal for the College’s first-ever honor code, which was presented by Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay Harris to the faculty at their monthly meeting Tuesday.
Harris also presented a proposal for the adoption of a new course credit system, replacing the College’s current system of course units. Under the proposed policy, courses that currently count as half-courses would be worth four credits, though the number of required courses necessary to graduate would remain constant.
Both proposals were presented for discussion only and were not ready for faculty vote.
During the discussion of the proposed honor code, faculty raised concerns surrounding the ambiguity in the policy’s language, especially as it concerned the frequency with which students would be required to sign or make an affirmation of integrity.
At the faculty’s last meeting in February, members asked Harris how often students would be required to make or sign the affirmation. Tuesday, Harris told the faculty that the frequency would be determined by the Dean of the College. But some said that provision is still too ambiguous.
The possibility that students might be required to sign or write the affirmation on every assignment “disconcerted” anthropology professor Arthur Kleinman, who said that further discussion is necessary to prevent this possibility.
“Something that is repeated all of the time is very different from something that is affirmed once in a student’s career or once every year,” computer science professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 said.
If the affirmation became too regular, said history professor Charles S. Maier ’60, it might become “ritualistic” and lose its meaning.
After hearing these concerns, Harris assured faculty members that the frequency, although initially proposed by the College Dean, would be sent to them for a vote before being enacted, because it would represent a change in the Faculty Handbook.
Still others questioned if students and faculty would be required to report instances of cheating under the new honor code and what would happen to those who refused to sign the affirmation of integrity.
Harris said that the honor code would not require students to report cheating if they saw it, and that, for this reason, exams would continue to be proctored under the new policy.
Professors would still be obligated to report cheating should it be brought to their attention by students, he added.
Harris also said that students who refuse to sign the affirmation would still be expected to abide by the code, but that further discussion surrounding that possibility had not yet taken place.
The honor code policy presented at the meeting would also establish an honor board to hear cases of potential violations of academic integrity. At least half of that board would be composed of undergraduate students, with faculty members, administrators, and teaching fellows filling the remaining seats.
In addition to the proposal from the Academic Integrity Committee, Harris proposed switching to a credit system from the current course system, with each half-course equalling four credits.
“I realize that for some of you this might be coming out of left field,” he said. “[We] have tried to structure this in such a way so that it will not change anything for those who do not want to change anything.”
Harris pointed to a new system for organizing student records that will be implemented in the fall of 2015 as a pragmatic reason for the switch. “That system comes ready-made equipped to deal with course credits rather than half-courses," he said.
Beyond the administrative reasons, Harris cited the need to "adjust to the reality of a changing academic world” as primary reason for the shift.
Specifically, he said, the new credit schema would allow for the future possibility of the introduction of a new type of shorter course, lasting for only part of a semester.  He said that a numerical course credit system would make these shorter courses—which are still a “theoretical possibility at this point”—easier to track administratively.
Addressing a question from one faculty member, Harris said that faculty members would have the same teaching requirements under the new policy.
Noting the importance of the in-person class experience, Harris also asked faculty members on behalf of the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Education Policy to consider revising a current policy that allows for simultaneous enrollment in courses that meet at overlapping times.
This semester, Harris said, the Administrative Board received and granted 200 petitions from undergraduates requesting permission for simultaneous enrollment, more than four times as many as the 44 who were granted permission six years ago.
Harris, along with members of the Ad Board who unanimously supported the presentation’s recommendations, argued that this signaled a departure from the College’s principles.
“Students are doing entire courses without ever stepping foot in a classroom,” Harris said. "What we are struggling to articulate is that this is not what a residential college should be offering and this is not what a Harvard education should be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While you were spending way too much time catching Pokémon on Google Maps, here is what happened in Crimson sports this past weekend:
Radcliffe lightweight crew beat BU and MIT to win its second consecutive Beanpot on Saturday. Perhaps MIT, which finished both the 1V and 2V races almost 30 seconds behind the Black and White, should consider attending the lesser-known Lentilcup next year. We hear it offers great competition for weaker schools while still providing all of the legume amenities the Beanpot is known for.
Men’s lacrosse was unsuccessful in its upset bid of No. 3 Duke, falling by a final score of 17-11. The Blue Devils were able to set the tone early by scoring just eight seconds into the match. Crimson head coach Chris Wojcik, so upset with his team’s performance in those first few seconds, is rumored to have spent his entire halftime speech saying the word “goal” every eight seconds to drive the point home.
The Women’s rugby team beat Boston College by a final score of 105-0. The margin was large enough to break the scoreboard, as it mistakenly displayed a score of 5-0 after it was unable to count past 100. Such an inability to process large numbers seems to have affected several on the Eagles roster as well, as many of their postgame press comments mentioned how the game “came right down to the wire” and that it was tough to lose “by just five points after such a long game.”
The women’s tennis team upset No. 27 Houston by a score of 4-3 in its last nonconference game of the year on Sunday afternoon at the Murr Center. While the Cougars may have lost on the court, they sure won the social media battle, ensuring that each and every one of their 600 followers immediately knew the outcome of the match by tweeting it out four separate times.
All scores, stats, and honors are entirely factual.  All quotes, comments, and background stories are entirely fictional and written in jest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The games may be over, but junior Wesley Saunders of the men’s basketball team continues to garner postseason accolades.
Saunders was voted to the Lou Henson 2014 All-America Team as one of the 30 top mid-major players in the nation. As a result, he is being considered for the Lou Henson award for the country's top mid-major performer.
Saunders caught the attention of many across the nation with his standout performance against Michigan State in the third round of the NCAA Tournament. The third-year swingman tallied 22 points in the seven-point loss against the Spartans, including going a perfect 10-for-10 from the charity stripe.
But long before that game, Saunders was making noise around the Ivy League. Saunders was the key cog in the Crimson’s top-ranked conference offense, averaging a team-leading 10.1 field goals per game while still managing to shoot 46.4 percent from the field. The Los Angeles, Calif. native also consistently made his way to the free-throw line this season, as he ranked fourth in the Ivy League with 5.7 attempts per game.
Despite the balanced nature of the Crimson offense that saw six players average more than nine points per game, Saunders ranked seventh across the Ivy League with 14.2 points per contest. The forward dropped more than 20 points in six games, including a 24-point winning effort against perennial Ivy League title-challenger Princeton.
Other notable candidates for the award are Langston Hall of Mercer, who helped earn a second round win against Duke with 11 points and five assists, and North Dakota State’s Taylor Braun, who posted 11 points and six rebounds in an upset over No. 5 seed Oklahoma.
The winner of the Lou Henson award will be announced on April 4th in Dallas, Texas, one day before the beginning of the Final Four.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just one short year ago, Cheta Emba had never set foot on a rugby pitch. But on Saturday afternoon, the junior looked perfectly comfortable on Cumnock Field.
Emba—who also splits time as a goalkeeper for the varsity women’s soccer team—helped spearhead the Harvard rugby team’s offensive charge against Boston College with four first-half tries. The Crimson (7-3) went on to rout the visiting Eagles, 105-0, for the largest margin of victory in the team’s inaugural varsity season.
“I thought the game on Saturday was a great turning point for the team,” Emba said. “We played more challenging opponents this spring, which have really made us hone down our skills. I thought on Saturday, we really had moments where we were finally clicking the way we wanted to on the field. It wasn’t perfect, but it is great to build from moving into this week when we travel to Penn State.”
With Harvard holding a 5-0 lead just two minutes into the contest, Emba added back-to-back tries to give the Crimson a comfortable 15-0 cushion.
“In the game this weekend, [Emba] did a good job [focusing] on her own execution,” co-captain Xanni Brown said. “She has very high standards, and she plays hard every day.”
Emba added two more tries later in the half and was a dominant force on the defensive side of the pitch. The junior’s efforts helped the Crimson amass a 60-0 lead going into halftime.
“[The tries were] really the product of our defensive lines and offensives lines meshing—the forwards gaining possession and getting the ball out quickly to us, and us back lines have good hands and connecting with each other to eventually get me the ball,” Emba said. “I was able to get them to the try zone to touch it down, but on my left and right were my teammates.”
While in just her first season of rugby, Emba has seen plenty of action between the posts as a third-year soccer goalkeeper. This past season, the junior was named a second team All-Ivy selection, boasting a 0.14 goals against average in 13 games of action.
But while the commitments of one varsity sport may be enough for most, Emba—who played both basketball and soccer in high school—still had the desire for something more.
“On the soccer field, when I transitioned into a full-time goalkeeper, I was still able to get the running side out of me in basketball,” Emba said. “Then in college, when I went full-time in soccer, I definitely missed being able to run [using] some of the skills that field players have for soccer. That combined with skill-playing and goalkeeping in rugby.”
“It’s a great complement to goalkeeping; a lot of catching and agility footwork,” Emba added. “It’s definitely a hidden cross-training opportunity.”
After the urging of several friends on the team, Emba visited a few rugby practice sessions last spring, as the Crimson began its transition from a club team into a full-fledged varsity program.
The junior first picked up the game regularly over the summer, playing for a sevens team while in Washington, D.C. When she returned to campus this fall, Emba committed to joining the inaugural varsity squad.
“It was difficult at the beginning,” Emba said. “The type of player I am, the type of person and teammate I am, I really want to be there for both of my teams. It really took me and the supportive coaches on both sides to figure out a schedule that would allow me to continue with my academic focus in the classroom, stay healthy, and enjoy my athletic pursuits as well.”
Emba missed the Crimson rugby squad’s fall action while competing on the soccer field. But in the spring, she has become a key source of offensive and defensive production for the Crimson at fullback.
“[Fullback] is a pretty high-pressured position for defense,” Brown said. “If there’s a break in our line, it’s up to Cheta to make big, important, try-saving tackles. It’s also a very crucial striking position on offense. Her athleticism really shines there.”
“There’s a lot of opportunities to kick and chase, which is something she’s pretty effective at as a goalie,” Brown added. “It’s been a place where she can come in and have a chance to learn and read the game, but also make a huge impact right out of the gates.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s always good to be home. After traveling from Florida, to Louisiana, and then to California, the Harvard women’s softball team (13-11) finally returned to Cambridge.
After having four games rained out this weekend, the Crimson took the field on Tuesday in a doubleheader against Boston College (15-15).
Dominant pitching would be the key to success, as Harvard followed up a first game victory in walkoff fashion with another win in the rubber game to sweep the doubleheader against the Eagles for the first time since 1999.
HARVARD 4, BOSTON COLLEGE 3
Although co-captain Kasey Lange ended the first game with a walkoff, two-run home run, the Crimson didn’t have much time to celebrate as the team retook the diamond for the second game of the afternoon.
Freshman Taylor Cabe stepped into the circle for Harvard and delivered another quality performance. In the six-inning contest, the rookie hurler went the distance, allowing only three runs on six hits to go along with eight strikeouts as she guided her squad to a 4-3 win.
In the first inning, the Crimson received a double from Hume and scored a run due to an error.
But in the top of the third inning, Cabe allowed two runs and Harvard was once against trailing.
It didn’t take long for the Crimson to respond, as the team bounced right back in the next frame to even the score. Hume reached base on a fielder’s choice, stole second, and then scored on a single up the middle by junior Emily Gusse.
In the top of the fifth, Boston College strung together a couple of hits to retake the lead. But once again, Harvard didn’t shy away.
“[We] stuck with the process,” junior Laura Ricciardone said. “We were then able to come through clutch with relentless efforts at the plate.”
After co-captain Shelbi Olson doubled to right field, a sacrifice bunt advanced her to third. Then her fellow captain stepped to the plate and delivered for the second time on the day. Lange blasted a double down the right field line, driving in Olson and tying the game.
After Lange moved to third on a sacrifice fly, junior Katherine Lantz knocked a single up the middle to give the Crimson its first lead of the ball game.
The one run advantage was all that Cabe would need. The freshman retook the mound in the sixth inning—the final frame of the day—and got two outs from her defense and took care of the final batter with a strikeout.
HARVARD 4, BOSTON COLLEGE 2
In the first game of the day, Ricciardone improved to 6-5 on the year, as she shut down the Eagles in a complete game effort. Ricciardone struck out eight batters, allowing only five hits for two earned runs in the 4-2 win.
The Eagles managed to get on the board early behind two hits and an error from Harvard. But Ricciardone took control from there. The junior hurler went the next five frames, surrendering just two hits.
“The change-up was working very effectively,” Ricciardone said. “Paired with some strategic pitch calling, we were able to limit the production of the BC offense.”
But Harvard couldn’t get its bats going. Unable to string together many hits, the Crimson offense remained silent for the first six innings of the game.
Devoid of any offensive support, Ricciardone hit a batter in the top of the seventh. The Eagles then played small ball, as bunting, pinch-running, and situational hitting pushed another run across the plate.
Facing a 2-0 deficit, Harvard seemed to be heading for a loss in the day’s first game. But the Crimson dugout didn’t see it that way.
Harvard only needed two runs in that final inning. It got a whole lot more.
Lantz began the inning with a single up the middle, and in the very next at-bat, the Crimson tied the game as junior Adrienne Hume blasted a home run, bringing life to Harvard’s dugout.
Then, with two outs and the game tied in the bottom of the seventh, Lange stepped up to the plate.
A season ago, Lange broke Harvard’s all-time home run record. This afternoon, the Crimson co-captain added to that tally.
“I just wanted to do the most with the opportunity I was given,” Lange said. “Adrienne had a huge home run before me, and I wanted to keep the ball rolling.”
Lange blasted a walkoff home run to left-center field, driving in junior Jessica Perillo to secure the win
“Winning in that way definitely gave us momentum for the second game,” Lange said. “We were able to complete a big sweep.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After rainy weather forced the Harvard baseball team to postpone its weekend games against Princeton and Cornell, the Crimson finally took the field on Tuesday to play its first Ivy League contests against the Big Red in Ithaca, New York.
Harvard (5-14, 1-1 Ivy) started off the day on the right foot by battling to capture a tight 6-5 victory over Cornell in ten innings. But the Big Red (9-9, 2-2) bounced back in the rubber game, earning a 6-2 victory over the visiting Crimson in order to salvage a split on the day’s action.
CORNELL 6, HARVARD 2
After taking the day’s first contest, the Crimson hoped to carry its momentum into the second game of the doubleheader.
“We had all the momentum in the world coming into that game,” junior centerfielder Mike Martin said. “We hit them hard in the first few innings.”
Unfortunately for Harvard, the team failed to take advantage of early opportunities for run production. The Crimson put itself in some good positions offensively, but, as has been the case for much of the season, the squad was unable to capitalize with runners on base. Harvard left eight men stranded on the base paths throughout the game.
“Sometimes you press too much and you try to do more than what you can do,” senior utilityman Carlton Bailey said. “That’s how baseball goes. You can have runners in scoring position every inning and not score a run.”
Things went from bad to worse when fielding errors and mistake pitches allowed the Cornell offense to plate five runs—capitalized by a three-run double from Chris Cruz—in the bottom of the third.
The Crimson attempted to claw its way back throughout the game. In the sixth inning, Martin was able to score by hitting his way on and then crossing the plate on a sacrifice fly to center field by junior catcher Ethan Ferreira.
“We were just trying to get ourselves back in the game,” Martin said. “We hadn’t been doing well hitting with runners in scoring position, and we were just looking to get going again.”
Harvard chipped away at the lead again in the eighth after junior right fielder Brandon Kregel smacked a double to left and eventually scored on a balk.
But it would all be too little, too late, as Cornell shut the Crimson down the rest of the way to seal a 6-2 Harvard loss.
HARVARD 6, CORNELL 5
Going into the first contest, the Harvard squad stepped off the bus energized and ready to finally play a full game against a conference opponent.
“Basically, our mentality was [that] we didn’t drive all this way to not put our best foot forward,” Bailey said. “Our energy was crazy.”
This energy remained even after the Big Red jumped out to an early 3-0 lead after three innings. The Crimson offense got rolling in the fourth frame when Kregel led off the inning by lacing a single to the third base side. The hitters behind him kept the line moving, and he would eventually score on a fielder’s choice off the bat of sophomore third baseman Mitch Klug.
“We just needed baserunners,” Martin said. “We put a couple together and [Cornell’s pitcher] lost command, so we kind of found our groove there.”
Despite a fourth inning home run from the Big Red’s Matt Hall, Harvard continued to narrow the deficit. In the next two innings, the team would tack on another four runs and take a one-run lead in the sixth courtesy of a single from senior second baseman Kyle Larrow which plated freshman shortstop Drew Reid.
Still, Cornell refused to go away quietly. In the bottom of the seventh, the Big Red’s Ryan Karl smashed a triple to right-center field, scoring teammate JD Whetsel and knotting the score at five. The game would remain tied through nine, and the teams entered extra innings.
After quickly hitting into two outs in the top of the 10th, the Crimson was running out of opportunities as Bailey came up to the plate.
“You don’t really want to keep going into 11, 12, 13 innings,” Bailey said. “You just try to get yourself on base and pass the torch to your teammates.”
Bailey came through by smacking an opposite field double, putting himself in scoring position and bringing Larrow to the plate. The second baseman also came through under pressure by singling to left field, allowing Bailey to race home from second to take the lead.
“We have a nickname for [Larrow],” Bailey said. “We call him ‘the servant.’ Whenever you need something, he’ll come through, and he did his job today.”
All that remained was for the Harvard pitching staff to seal the deal, and senior Zack Olson did just that. He recorded two strikeouts in the final frame and closed the door on Cornell to secure the 6-5 win for his team.

 Happy Wednesday! In case you need some mid-week happiness, here’s a recap of some of the funniest April Fools’ Day jokes from yesterday:
1) Google Maps’ Pokémon Challenge: Google Maps came out with a video stating that they are looking for future employees who also happen to be Pokémon masters. If you open the Google Maps App on your smartphone, you can actually catch Pokémon by walking to the locations indicated on the map. It’s basically everyone’s childhood wish come true.
2) Dolphins Create Rainbow Laser Beam: PBS announced yesterday that when the U.S. Navy shined lights in front of dolphins, their chirps created rainbow laser beams. A great line from the article: “‘We were shocked to be honest,’ Greenbaum recalls. ‘This is the sort of thing you’d normally see on a fourth-grader’s Trapper Keeper. But in real life? Seriously?’”
3) Dominos Edibox: The pizza fast-food chain came out with a “waste-free dining experience” yesterday when it introduced a doughy pizza box that people can eat in its entirety. Let’s be real– I’m sure there were a lot of us who were disappointed this doesn’t actually exist.
4) TripAdvisor’s “10 unforgettable destinations for families”: TripAdvisor released a list of 10 fictional places that have all received reviews on their website, including The Matrix and King’s Landing. Notable reviews include Azkaban (“Our accommodations were a bit grim, but our vacation was magical!") and Gotham City (“The clown had the boys giggling for hours!”).
5) Gus+Sietse’s Resignation: UC President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15 and Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15 announced their resignations and stated that Dean Evelynn Hammonds and Sam B. Clark ‘15 would take over. The e-mail was filled with GIFs and a reference to swai fish– what more could you ask for?

 Flyby sat down with Genevieve Adams, a young actress, writer, and filmmaker, to discuss her first co-produced independent film I’m Obsessed with You (But You’ve Got to Leave Me Alone), which she also wrote and starred in. Set at Dartmouth, where Adams wrote the play as a script for her honors thesis, I’m Obsessed with You is “a coming of age ensemble comedy about an eccentric collegiate improv group who tries to live life according to the ‘yes and’ rule of improv.” The film is premiering at the Sonoma International Film Festival this week and the Boston International Film Festival on April 19th.
 The positive response and enthusiasm for her script at Dartmouth continued as the play premiered in New York City. She decided to adapt the production into a film, hoping to share her story and characters with a wider audience. “I never predicted this, to be honest. I always knew I wanted a career in entertainment but I didn’t necessarily know what shape that would take,” Adams says, reflecting on the upcoming premiere of her film.
Adams had never written a screenplay before, and composed seventeen drafts of I’m Obsessed with You. “The story basically remained the same, but with film, you have a lot more scenes and you can use a lot more locations in the visual medium. My first couple of drafts were very dialogue-heavy, but then I learned how to tell the story with pictures,” she revealed.
The indie film market is competitive and filmmakers apply to different festivals, working to achieve positive regional distributions and hoping to attract the attention of a sales agent, and then a distributor, aiming towards wider release, either in theaters, or online, for example on Netflix. Adams notes that while “there are so many avenues for independent films now, I’m Obsessed with You is an audience movie” and so she would like to see it “become a theatrical release, because it’s the kind of movie that people enjoy seeing in groups. You lose something watching comedies alone.”
Any advice for aspiring actors or filmmakers? “If you approach things in a practical and creative way, you can make things happen for yourself.  We’re living in a time in entertainment and art where anything is possible, if you’re willing to put in the work and believe in your originality and the people around you,” she advises.
I’m Obsessed with You (But You’ve Got to Leave Me Alone) premieres April 19th at the Boston International Film Festival.

It’s March Madness, and we all know what that means—illegal office pools, Duke losses, Harvard upsets, and, of course, the famed March Madness vasectomy. Wait, what? That’s right, it’s a trend—men throughout the country are getting their vas deferens snipped at the beginning of the annual college basketball tournament, giving them the opportunity to sit back, stay home from work, and watch all the college basketball they could possibly want. In the spirit of the March Madness vasectomy, here are some suggestions for other potential pairings.
 
The post-Thanksgiving vasectomyTired of coming home from work and fighting for those prized turkey leftovers? A vasectomy right around Turkey Day not only allows you to forage for both the dark AND white meat, but also lets you do your Cyber Monday shopping from the comfort of your couch. And you'll you earn some well-deserved sympathy when it’s time to get those Christmas decorations out of the attic!
 
The House of Cards vasectomyNetflix has pioneered the technique of releasing all 13 episodes of a season at midnight (Pacific time, unfortunately). Unfortunately, most people do not really have 13 hours to spend watching the next steps in the Frank Underwood saga, meaning they are left in the dust around the office water cooler as interns boast about how they finished the show in one night. The House of Cards vasectomy keeps you away from those spoilers and gives you the opportunity to look smart on your first day back at work.
 
The Shark Week vasectomyThis one needs no explanation (besides maybe a link to the “official unofficial countdown for Shark Week 2014”). There's nothing like watching creatures with sharp teeth rip into things as you recover from your snip. Bonus: this one is somewhat flexible, considering that the last four Shark Weeks are now streaming on Netflix. 
 
The Dominos 50% Off Pizza Week vasectomyPatients of this year's March Madness vasectomies certainly took advantage of this category as well, since Dominos took the opening rounds of the NCAA tournament as a prime time to reintroduce the special they initially rolled out in January.  To get this one right, you might need someone on the inside of the Dominoes Powers That Be to tip you off when they next plan to roll out this promotion.
 
The Finals Period vasectomyThis is probably the most relevant for our demographic (although we’re hoping this article will help us cut into Golf Digest’s market share). You’ll definitely have some explaining to do to your girlfriend/ boyfriend/ doctor/ parents/ Ad Board, though.

Did you think you were special when you got into Harvard? Maybe you were, but the bar has been raised. Kwasi Enin, a high school senior from Long Island, New York, got into all eight Ivy League colleges. That is the new gold standard, and we all fall short. Welcome to mediocrity. This is absolutely insane. What does one have to do to get into all eight Ivies? Who even applies to all eight? Seriously. Many of us actually want to know so we can start planning for our children. Music lessons and community service straight out of the womb? On it. Enin has the opportunity to dictate how a whole new generation of overachievers is raised.
While we all go about our day living in Enin’s shadow, we can’t help but wonder which school he will choose. Despite our newfound self-doubt, we’d all like to believe Harvard is the obvious choice. The other Ivies are great to varying degrees obviously, but come on. It’s Harvard.
Oftentimes in the college process, we were told to find the best fit for us. Why is Harvard the best fit for Enin?
Well, he won’t feel like a freak here. He wouldn’t be another small fish in a big pond like many of us, but he would be a medium-sized fish, at the very least. We have Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and JFK as just a few of our alumni. Kwasi who? His genius and success would be celebrated, but odds are the average person could name several such “celebs” who go here. On the other hand, who can think of anyone who has ever attended Penn?
Of course, maybe that’s not want the kid wants. This kid already has Facebook celebrity written all over him. One post in the Class of 2018 Facebook group, and his fate would be sealed. Who doesn’t want that? You can imagine all the texts flying during the first week of school between awkward new roommates: “HOLY CRAP I just saw that kid who got into all 8 Ivies in Annenberg!”
Harvard is the only place where Enin’s success could simultaneously be hugely admired and not too out of the ordinary. So congratulations, Kwasi Enin. Thank you for making us all feel inferior. We better see you in the fall.

March has come to a close, and with it has come a bulk of college decision letters. While many will undoubtedly be celebrating, many will also undoubtedly be angry and disappointed with the news they have received.
To those who belong to the latter group, I say: I’m sorry. I get it. I feel you.
You scoff. Perhaps you look at my byline and (rightly) conclude that I am a Harvard student. By most people’s definition, I won the college admissions game show. What makes me qualified to offer advice and condolences to students who are struggling with the news they’ve received this week?
I’ll let you in on a little secret.
Harvard students get rejected too.
A lot.
Some friends of mine here have remarked, both seriously and jokingly, that learning how to be rejected is one of the most shocking and most valuable things they have gained at Harvard.
I know right now, it feels like your entire life hinges on what college you will go to. I was also once a high school senior (cue the walking stick), and I remember the constant preparation for applications and unending buzz about colleges coming from every corner of your life.
In that constant chatter, it might be hard to remember that college is just one of the many times in your life where some doors will be close for you and some doors will open. Right now, college might feel like the be-all and end-all, but as a college student, I can tell you it really isn’t.
In fact, as someone much wiser than me once told me, college is only two things: an experience and a series of opportunities that you pass on, apply for, get rejected from, and take advantage of.
This will be true no matter what college you end up attending.
There’s not much I can do to help you with your pain. Rejection sucks. College rejections especially so.
You’re allowed to cry about the opportunity lost.
Call your friends, break out the ice cream, daydream about what that alternate life might’ve been like, read a couple more of letters like this (I’ve done it. I recommend this one.).
Then, pack it away as best you can.
Try to keep in mind that when college itself rolls around, you’ll want to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy it. Chances are good that you’ll be presented with so much that is dizzyingly new that the scar will fade all by itself.
Go out and celebrate your success.
Yes. Celebrate.
Because rejection never has and never will equal lack of success, now or in the future.
National dropout rates are about 7%. Of those who graduate high school, about 20% do not attend college. Yet in May, you will be walking across the stage and towards college.
Add to these facts your own high school achievements, your triumphs over academic and personal difficulties in the twelve years you’ve been in school, and know this: Regardless of whatever rejections you have received or will receive, you are a success story.
And also, if it makes you feel better (it does for me)—Harvard students get rejected too.
