After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
She brings him home, but not without warning the house first: the good plates, the scratched table, the dining room’s pear green walls. She warns her mom too, though she knows the side-eye and chisme are only inevitable. She knows her mom’s hawk gaze, checking if he eats with his hands, counting how many beers he tips down his throat. Once it’s time for board games, her mom will spread his dinner party wrongdoings on the table like cards; her mom will shuffle his manner mishaps into a deck of arguments against her loving him.
When she squeaks the door open, he shadows her into the warm fog of the kitchen, humid with the frying of arroz con huevo frito. Her sister trips out of her sandals to stick him with kisses, a bouquet of red imprints for each cheek. Her brother lingers by the sink with glasses of too-sweet, too-purple chicha. Her mom tsk-tsks the kids out of the room because the table won’t set itself, and don’t you know the smoke will stink your dress shirt?
She knew her mom would squint disapprovingly at his gold chain, the hole in his left sneaker. What she wasn’t expecting was her mom digging her nails into her shoulder as she brought out the appetizer. What she wasn’t expecting was the slamming down of the plate, hard enough to make the egg yolk jiggle with her resentment. The plantains’ sweetness fills her nostrils as they bow their heads to say grace, and the night is blessed until her mom passes him the salt and asks what the poor tailor wants with her daughter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an artist, I sometimes feel like a sellout.
Choosing to come to Harvard was, for me, the easy choice: Going to college is what the world expects of its youth. College is the road most traveled, the societal norm, the path of least resistance. If I were a true artist, comfortable with sacrifice, shouldn’t I have been strong enough to stray from the norm and follow my heart? And though I love being a college student — my classes, my peers, and everything else — dance captures me in a way that academia never could. The pandemic, which moved us to online classes, granted me a second chance to attend a pre-professional ballet program and devote most of my days to training. But this experience — with one foot still in college and the other in the ballet world — has only reminded me of how difficult it is to pursue art.
This was something I had wanted to do in high school — to move away from home, like most pre-professional dancers, and train full time. And though I would like to think that I am strong-willed enough to choose the right path for me, the pressures to follow the prescribed societal path were, and are, incredibly strong. Most artists have been told, likely many times throughout their lives, that art is great, but you must continue in school as a “backup plan” in case it doesn’t work out — the implication being that it likely won’t, and the subtext being that art isn’t a valuable skill to pursue full-time. Once, a mom told me, “You can’t waste your brains on dance, you have to go to college.” As if art doesn’t require brains.
This isn’t just a case of bad (and common) advice. It’s indicative of the way that art is valued in our society. In a widely viewed Ted Talk called “Do Schools Kill Creativity,” Sir Ken Robinson describes how our society seems to have internalized a sort of hierarchy of talents, based on their usefulness to society, with academia and STEM on top and arts at the bottom. Academic ability, Robinson says, “has really come to dominate our view of intelligence,” with all other talents valued far less.
But this is a mistaken outlook. Intelligence is far more complex than that: Some people are kinesthetically intelligent, wired to move, to dance, or to do sports. Others have extremely high EQs (Emotional Intelligence Quotient) that allow them to empathize, understand, and work well with others. Intelligence is not just being able to calculate integrals, and this hierarchical view of various skills is detrimental to individuals who might have the potential to become the next Picasso, yet are led to believe they aren’t smart and are discouraged from developing their artistic abilities.
The advice to get a “useful” degree and find a “real” job, if flawed, isn’t necessarily wrong — though it shouldn’t have to be that way. A career in art, particularly one that is financially stable, much less successful, is incredibly difficult to come by. Underappreciation for the arts has led to a chronically and critically underfunded industry, with America ranking particularly poorly in this regard. This is a disparity that has only been further highlighted by the pandemic. While countries in Europe provided relief funding to the arts, President Trump was attempting to, once again, dissolve the National Endowment for the Arts.
Actually, it’s in the best interest of the government to fund the arts, as they can play a hugely influential role in society. The arts are integral to community building, playing an important role in shaping social and cultural capital among citizens. They can both reflect the general climate of the times, and spur further change. Most importantly, we turn to art in times of crisis such as these, for comfort, for escape, for solace.
As Robinson put forward, if there’s any hope for significant change, schools must reform their arts education policies. The division that exists needs to dissolve. Growing up, I always felt that my school life and my dance life were two entirely separate worlds. I was envious of my brothers, who ran cross country, because their teammates were also their school friends, and it was so easy for them to balance academics and athletics considering that the two were ensconced in the same building. A disparity exists amongst the arts as well: While music, visual art, and theater had fairly established programs in my high school, dance was never on the table.
We need art, and we need artists. Therefore, we need to stop quashing artistic inclination in young people, and start supporting them, both on the individual level, and the macro level. Go to a museum, attend a Broadway performance, and go to the ballet! And more than this, we need to reform our schools to broaden arts education and challenge our societal understanding of intelligence.
—Sara Komatsu ‘23’s column “Backstage at the Ballet” explores anything and everything ballet-related, from its moments of joy and despair to the broader, systematic issues within it.

The T should be free. As college students and the youth of Boston, we believe that a fare-free Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority system would help both low-income communities and the environment, without imposing increased financial burdens on everyone. To implement this fare-free system, two critical steps must occur first: We must free the MBTA from its debt, and then we must implement alternative revenue sources.
Currently, there is an appalling exponential growth of inequity in the Boston area. Not only does Boston rank sixth on the list of American cities with the highest income inequality, but economic mobility is decreasing in Massachusetts. We need a fare-free MBTA to help slow down, or even reverse, this trend. By allowing people to travel more affordably to school, job interviews, and other opportunities, this system would reduce some simple barriers that these low-income individuals face.
A fare-free system could also have a positive impact on the economy of the Boston area as a whole. Contrary to trickle-down theory, economists at the International Monetary Fund have found that a one percentage point increase in the income share of the top 20 percent is associated with a 0.08 percentage point decrease in GDP growth over the following five years, while the same increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent is associated with a 0.38 percentage point increase in GDP growth. Thus, by relieving the economic constraints borne by low-income communities, a free MBTA will benefit and improve the overall economy in the long term.
A free MBTA system will be more environmentally sustainable as well. In 2018 alone, Boston emitted 6.4 million metric tons of greenhouse gases, with 29 percent of these greenhouse gases emerging from the transportation sector. If the MBTA is free, citizens will have more incentives to ride instead of drive, which will thereby reduce carbon emissions and improve public health.
So how do we actually make the MBTA free?
First, the MBTA’s massive debt creates legislative barriers. In 2019, the MBTA had a structural deficit of $36.5 million and expected to spend $480 million to service its debt. Due to the pandemic, the agency now anticipates facing a deficit of at least $308 million — perhaps as much as $577 million — in the coming years. Before we can implement a fare-free system, the MBTA must be brought out of its massive debt.
Unfortunately, the MBTA cannot necessarily depend on a steady or sufficient supply of aid from the federal government, which has long underfunded and neglected accessible public transportation. Part of the problem is the hierarchy of responsibility. The Federal Transit Administration is responsible for providing financial support to public transportation systems across the nation, but the funds it uses require authorization by the United States Congress. It is the continued failure of Congress to recognize public transportation as a necessary right — including now, as a stimulus for transit is mired in negotiations — that has exacerbated the problem.
The largest concern about the fare-free proposal is making up the MBTA’s budget deficit fare revenue currently covers. Fare revenue, which makes up around one-third of total revenue, is the organization’s second-largest revenue source.
But this revenue can be made up. One method would be increasing the number of advertisements on the T or other modes of MBTA transportation.
The best way to fill this gap, however, would be to increase sales tax or to allocate a greater portion of sales tax revenue to the MBTA. Boston, which generates a disproportionate amount of revenue compared to its population and land area, is the “economic engine” of the state. If a free MBTA can help people get to work on time, reduce carbon emissions, and reduce barriers posed by socioeconomic inequalities, it is a worthy investment towards a better future for the state.
Who will bear the responsibility to fund the MBTA? The popular argument that there will be an extreme increase in taxes on ordinary citizens is untrue. A two-cent increase in Massachusetts’s gas tax would cover fare-free buses statewide, according to Livable Streets Alliance. The group also argued it would only cost about $36 million a year to stop collecting fares on buses in Greater Boston, or $60 million to do it statewide. Assuming that more people in Boston would be using the MBTA service if it is free, these extra taxes and funds would be a comparatively insignificant amount of the overall budget. Even if taxes did increase, the financial burden would not have to fall on the middle class. For instance, large corporations could be the main target of the extra taxes, since many of the MBTA’s riders work for these companies.
That’s why we need Massachusetts politicians to step in. Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79, you can publicly advocate for your loyal constituents to lobby for an increased awareness of public transportation in Congress. And you can help get rid of the MBTA’s enormous deficit so that we can implement bolder ideas. A financially secure, fare-free MBTA system would make this state a better place and a role model for the country.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, the Cambridge City Council approved plans for a new records management system that collects police activity and makes local traffic stop data available to the public through an online dashboard. This move is, no doubt, a response to the summer protests over the killings of George Floyd, Jacob Blake, and Breonna Taylor, when calls for major changes to policing rang out in streets and squares across the country. And yet we’re still waiting for the deep, structural reforms necessary for real progress.
We cannot celebrate this resolution as a victory in any meaningful sense. The information the public will find on the dashboard is unlikely to be illuminating. We already have the facts. We already know the problems. Racial biases are pervasive in the policing system, and Black and Latino men are far more likely to be pulled over on the road. Transparency is important, but it’s not a move toward true accountability; and even then, racist policing cannot be solved simply by holding “bad apples” accountable.
A framework that only considers cops as atomized actors fails to acknowledge the fact that racism is tightly woven into the entire system of policing. Suspending or convicting individual officers cannot and will not tear out the racist roots of police forces. Reform needs to strike at the fundamental structure of police departments — it requires us to rethink how we want our society to operate.
In addition, we are apprehensive about the growing reliance on data and technology in police departments across the country — a move that often accompanies or contributes to enhanced surveillance policies that violate privacy and free speech rights, increase the rate of false positives, and reinforce racial biases. Though the new records management system hopes to alleviate racial injustice and are seemingly well-intentioned, we hope the Cambridge Police Department does not use this data-driven approach to evaluate itself in its policing of Cantabrigians. That will not deliver a complete or nuanced picture.
If the Cambridge City Council wants to take action against injustice, we strongly urge it to significantly defund the police department and divert funds to measures that could have a much greater impact on public utility and welfare. The current allocation does not best serve the people of Cambridge. For example, alongside a new records system, the council adopted a second motion that commits them to between 40 and 45 new housing vouchers for Cambridge residents experiencing homelessness. More funds should have been allocated here and to programs that seek to directly help those who need it most.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rhonda Lotti heard a knock on her door.
It was a Monday, July 11, 2011. Rhonda was at her home in Watertown, Mass., barely a 15-minute drive from Harvard’s campus. She had spoken to her 19-year-old daughter earlier that morning on her way to work, chiding her for not coming home the night before.
“I passed her in the hall and just said ‘You know Mariah I’m really not happy with this and we’re going to have to talk about this when I get home from work.’ And I rushed out the door.”
But that would be the last time Rhonda spoke to Mariah. By the time the police came to her door her daughter was already dead.
Rhonda’s face lights up when I ask about Mariah. She describes her as smart, sarcastic, witty. And, of course, kind. At 19, she was eager to travel, to go beyond the “really safe comfort zone” of outer Boston. Her future was uncertain but bright — she had an interest in the technical work behind music production; a love for words; and an eye on pursuing a journalism degree at New York University. Her mother even used to joke that she should go to law school, because “she could argue about anything” and prove persuasive.
She never got to do any of it. That summer night Mariah overdosed on heroin, becoming one of the roughly 450,000 Americans to succumb to an opioid overdose since 1999. Her mother thought she hadn’t taken opioids in almost a year, and still believes she relapsed in the weekend leading up to her death. But Mariah had wrestled with substance abuse disorder in the past, starting with prescription medication like Oxycontin and switching to heroin “when they started cracking down,” according to her mother. Painkillers were, after all, very accessible — irresponsibly so.
Mariah’s tragic journey matches a broader trend — roughly four in five new heroin users started out abusing prescription painkillers; most adolescents who misuse painkillers get them for free through friends or relatives. It was the origins of that trend — and a fair degree of indignation — that would take Rhonda several years later to one of the many protests against Harvard’s Arthur M. Sackler Museum.
The Sackler family has found itself at the center of a national controversy over the origins of the opioid epidemic. It was a Sackler venture, Purdue Pharma, that first introduced Oxycontin in 1995, arguably kickstarting the opioid epidemic and reportedly reaping billions worth of profits. Their company has faced thousands of lawsuits — yes, thousands — over the years, and recently agreed to a tentative $8 billion-dollar settlement (one that is still likely to leave their fortune mostly intact). Their donations have been refused by the prominent artistic institutions that once lavished them with honors; at least one hedge fund has decided to stop handling their financial assets.
So why is Harvard different? Why our public reluctance to sever ties with the Sackler name? Are we seriously less morally stringent than a hedge fund?
Perhaps we are. But the truth is that Arthur M. Sackler’s connection to the opioid crisis is rather complex. He and his brothers Raymond and Mortimer bought Purdue Frederick, Purdue’s direct predecessor, but Arthur died nine years before Oxycontin’s release. His direct descendants sold off their stake in the company shortly after and haven’t been mentioned in any of the family lawsuits; his widow, Dame Jillian Sackler has embarked on a very public campaign to clear his name, drawing a distinction between “fair-minded people” who seek justice for the epidemic and those who choose to “vilify” her husband (In a written statement delivered by spokesperson Janet Wooten, Ms. Sackler reiterated her husband’s innocence, and said that he would have been “appalled” by Purdue’s “deceptive marketing.”). Institutions like our own have thus been reluctant to sever ties with Arthur Sackler. As Rhonda puts it, “museums will love to tell you that Arthur Sackler died before Oxycontin came on the scene and that he had nothing to do with it, and he’s completely innocent.”
But the reality is more complex — and certainly uglier.
Arthur M. Sackler might have passed before the Oxycontin was first commercialized — but his innovations in the field of medical marketing were crucial in shaping the aggressive marketing approach that made it a success first, and a tragedy later. The key to understanding the opioid epidemic lies in the advertising of the painkillers themselves, which he revolutionized. The Medical Advertising Hall of Fame posthumously induced him, proclaiming that “no single individual did more to shape the character of medical advertising.”
Harvard Medical School Professor Scott Harris Podolsky ’93 described him as playing a “key role” in the transformation of the field in the second half of the 20th century, highlighting his collaboration with Pfizer in the 1950s. Podolsky says this role involved helping pioneer flashy advertising that included a legitimizing “patina of science”; advertising the “broad spectrum” of uses for a drug; and radically increasing the targeting of clinicians through pharmaceutical detailing. Under his guidance, Pfizer’s drug sales force multiplied exponentially, increasing from eight to 2,000 in under three decades, and implementing the kind of problematic industry tendencies — like gifting meals and free samples to clinicians — that we face today.
Of course, the emergence of these practices “generally encouraged” the overprescribing of medication. As Podolsky puts it, available evidence suggests that “marketing plays a great role in the overexpansion of use" of opioids, not only when used deceptively (like Purdue has been accused of doing), but more generally because of the “conflation of commercial goals with public health goals.” And so, despite his passing, when Oxycontin came around, Purdue made ample use of the framework that Arthur Sackler had pioneered. It hired the services of I.M.S, a company co-founded by the late Sackler that offered detailed information about doctors’ prescribing habits and used to target communities susceptible to Oxycontin. It engaged in large-scale physician “education” that mimicked Arthur’s detailing; it targeted physicians aggressively and personally. Trying to separate the epidemic from the architect of the commercial tactics that enabled it is disingenuous at best.
And so, onto the inevitable question — how should Harvard reckon with his controversial figure?
Activists have repeatedly called for the University to rename the Arthur M. Sackler Museum; University President Lawrence S. Bacow has stated that such a move would be "inappropriate” (University spokesperson Christopher M. Hennessy declined to comment on the matter). Rhonda herself isn’t entirely sure. She’s hardly keen on Arthur Sackler, deeming him “not innocent by any stretch of the imagination.” Yet her position has shifted since she attended the museum protest. She believes removing his name would amount to a whitewashing of our history. Instead, she’d rather see the museums reflect the full Sackler tale, “the dark side of their involvement.” As for the University, she seems less focused on apologies and more eager to see programs for those who have struggled with substance abuse disorders; exactly the kind of programs that could have proven crucial to Mariah. I’m not exactly surprised — her multiple allusions to feeling grateful for the support she’s received had already made me suspect that she might favor a more restorative, introspective approach than merely removing a name.
Perhaps that’s what shocked me while writing this piece — the sheer contrast between the two sides of the narrative. Rhonda Lotti opened up about losing her 19-year-old child. She trusted me, a complete stranger, barely the age of Mariah when she passed, to tell her story; she agreed to a video conference from her phone and, voice breaking, fidgeting with her glasses, opened up gracefully about the biggest loss a parent could imagine.
Jillian Sackler’s statement rejected any suggestion that Arthur Sackler might have been anything short of perfect, or that his name might not be worth championing. It struck me that she doesn’t seem to begin to understand why some blame her late husband; or even sympathize with the idea that, even if she believes in his innocence (even if she were right!), the concerns voiced by Rhonda and other victims’ families shouldn’t be discarded as scapegoating. Instead, she complains, against one of the many institutions that bear his name, about the prospective damage to Arthur’s “legacy.”
I wonder whether Mariah deserves a legacy too.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge installed a student-designed augmented reality exhibit exploring systemic racism in front of the Cambridge Public Library at Joan Lorentz Park earlier this month.
Students at the Cambridge Public Library STEAM Academy — a collaboration between the library and Innovators for Purpose, a local non-profit that gives young students experience working on real-world projects — created the exhibit, titled “This Should Not Be.”
The exhibit consists of several physical posts spread around the library that can each be converted to augmented reality with a cellphone, according to Reinhard Engels, manager of innovation and technology at the Cambridge Public Library.
“Each of these physical posts has a specific location that is recognized by augmented reality software,” he said. “When you walk around the exhibit with the free Hoverlay app, it recognizes these signposts and superimposes augmented reality content on these signposts.”
The City of Cambridge, Cambridge Trust, Cambridge Public Library Foundation, Margaret and H. A. Rey Curious George Fund, Eric and Jane Nord Family Fund, and Verizon provided financial support for the exhibit.
Michael K. Dawson, the co-founder and CEO of Innovators for Purpose, said the idea for the project came from his discussions with students about the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May, as well as other incidents of police brutality.
“The goal was to give teens a platform to speak out against systemic racism and talk about their ideas on how we might create an America that we can all believe in,” he said.
Maria T. H. McCauley, director of libraries for the City of Cambridge, said the library decided to host the exhibit because it seemed like a “natural extension” of its goal of supporting learning and literacy.
“The skills that the students are learning are really incredible – it’s very high level work,” she said. “They will definitely be able to bring these skills into industry, if that’s what they so desire.”
The exhibit, which debuted Nov. 5, remains up at the library, which plans to expand its augmented reality initiative to other locations across the city.
Emily St. Germain, STEAM programs manager at the Cambridge Public Library, said the students who designed the exhibit hoped to spark conversations among visitors.
“The intent of the installation was for people to engage in conversation around racism and race — particularly as it’s tied to the pandemic — and to begin to think about what more they might do to combat racism,” she said.
McCauley said the exhibit demonstrated the strength of the partnerships that came together to support and underwrite it.
“I think that this is a really wonderful example of what can happen when different community partners and funding partners come together,” she said. “We really can transform lives, and I think the people walking by recognize that it’s a powerful experience for them.”

As the Undergraduate Council’s leadership turns over, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that he views the group as a conduit between administrators and students.
Noah A. Harris ’22 and Jenny Y. Gan ’22 — the UC president and vice president elect — ran on a platform of “Building Tomorrow’s Harvard.” Their vision centered around promoting diversity and inclusion, re-invigorating students’ social life, and bolstering resources for health and wellness. They will take office in December, replacing outgoing UC President James A. Mathew ’21 and Vice President Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21.
Just over 1500 students, representing around a quarter of the undergraduate student body, voted in last week’s UC election. The low turnout followed a year of discontent with Mathew and White-Thorpe for struggling to meet challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
When asked about the low turnout, Khurana emphasized the value the College places on civic engagement.
“I believe that civic engagement is a critical component of being a citizen and citizen leader,” he said. “That’s not just participating in national elections — it also means being active all the time in your community.”
Khurana said the UC is a “critical vehicle” through which the administration hears student voices, and he acknowledged that its representatives have made concerted efforts in recent years to engage and represent undergraduates of all backgrounds.
He noted, however, that the UC is not the sole avenue through which students can communicate their needs and concerns to the administration. He cited House Committees, the Standing Committee on Undergraduate Educational Policy, and the Committee on Student Life in the Dean of Students Office.
During the campaign, Harris and Gan said they aim to support undergraduates struggling with mental health. Harris and Gan said they hope to provide students with easy access to mental health resources, especially during the pandemic.
The pair proposed adding anonymous mental health check-ins to Crimson Clear, the site through which students self-report COVID-19 symptoms or potential exposures on a daily basis.
Asked about Harris and Gan’s proposal, Khurana said ensuring students’ mental health during the pandemic is a “very high priority” for the College.
“I recognize it’s been a challenge for our students, whether they’re remote or on campus, that the pandemic has created an incredible sense of anxiety and pressure and stresses for individuals, for families and communities,” he said.
He said the College has worked with Harvard University Health Services and Counseling and Mental Health Services to share information they learn about student experiences. Khurana referred specific questions about current or potential surveys to identify student mental health challenges to HUHS.
He went on to acknowledge, however, that the pandemic has created new challenges for University staff working to support students’ mental health. He cited HUHS’s effort to navigate legal concerns regarding which services Harvard can deliver virtually and students’ challenges finding private places to speak with mental health professionals at home.
Harris said in an interview with The Crimson last week that he hopes to establish close connections with the administration, including via monthly meetings with Khurana.
Khurana said he “graciously accepts” this invitation and would welcome continuing regular meetings with the UC.
“I’m very much looking forward to working with our new UC leadership,” Khurana said. “I want to congratulate them on their election. The College very much has a partnership approach with the UC.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 16, 2020, 12:51 p.m.
Harvard’s Undergraduate Council passed legislation Sunday establishing a feedback system for its members to anonymously report diversity-related issues within their ranks.
The legislation’s list of sponsors included the UC’s current and incoming presidents and vice presidents — James Mathew ’21, Ifeoma E. “Ify” White-Thorpe ’21, Noah A. Harris ’22, and Jenny Y. Gan ’22, respectively. Mather House representative Anusha “Anu” Zaman ’23; Cabot House representative Brooke L. Livingston ’23; Adams House representative Esther J. Xiang ’23; and Elm Yard representative Emily M. “Emmy” Cho ’24, a Crimson News comper, also sponsored the proposal.
Members would be able to respond to the feedback from the legislation anonymously, though they would have to provide their name under certain conditions. If the Council finds a member guilty of misconduct, the body can punish them via reprimand, censure, or expulsion from the UC.
However, the feedback system would be centered around the victim, and the goal was not to punish a member in such a manner, Zaman said.
The current consequences are “cancel culture disguised as accountability,” Zaman wrote in an email to The Crimson. “These measures [need] to be changed as they could be easily weaponized and abused against peers.”
“You can raise concerns anonymously which will be addressed at the level to which it had public scrutiny,” Zaman said Sunday. “If it’s a private issue, I would require to have your name, just for the purpose of being able to follow up.”
The act cited an internal survey the Council launched to investigate “allegations of racism, misogyny, classism, and various mechanisms of othering.”
“There’s a lot of issues like racism, misogyny, classism, mechanisms of othering that were found at various levels of interaction within the UC,” Zaman said. “As a result of that we want to have responses that will actually find solutions.”
The survey results showed six members of the Council indicated disagreement or neutrality with the statement, “if I could decide all over again, I would still want to be a member of the UC.” Eight disagreed with a statement suggesting that Council general meetings provide a welcoming environment. Sixty percent of members reported witnessing overt bullying on the Council, whereas ninety percent reported witnessing covert bullying.
“Sometimes male voices still dominate, even though my committee is majority female,” one member said in the survey.
Sunday’s meeting was not the first time Council members raised issues of diversity, belonging, and inclusion. In 2018, some council members gave a presentation to the UC on gender dynamics within the body. At the time, the presenters told The Crimson they thought “the Council can sometimes take male representatives more seriously than other UC representatives.”
Zaman said those concerns still linger today.
“I’ve already had people contact me, speak off the record about their experiences and to have certain things addressed,” Zaman said. “I think it’s really important that we pass this.”
The legislation passed unanimously.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Phillips Brooks House Association awarded activist Tarana J. Burke with the 14th Annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Award in a webinar Friday.
PBHA event coordinators lauded her advocacy work, spanning over 25 years, to address sexual violence, racial injustice, and systemic inequality. One of Burke’s most recent and well-known causes is the #MeToo movement, which has propelled survivors of sexual violence and their allies to the mainstream.
Following her acceptance of the award, Burke participated in a fireside chat with PBHA Vice-President Chiamaka N. Obilo ’21 and Alumni Coordinator Sarai P. Perez Camacho ’22, as well as a question-and-answer session facilitated by PBHA Community Organizing Chair Anastasia Onyango ’22.
Oblio and Camacho first asked Burke to describe her journey as a social justice advocate. Burke said her path has been “all over,” though she feels privileged to have grown up in a family “steeped in black radical condition.” College, Burke added, was where she became the “Rah! Rah! person,” advocating boldly for any instance of injustice.
Burke said she now views her journey as having been centered on compassion, justice, and outspokenness.
“My journey was about loving us, was about equity, was about empathy — all of that sort of converging, and saying I’ve got to step out boldly, even though I’m not an expert,” Burke added.
Oblio and Camacho then turned the conversation toward Burke’s most recent and most famous movement addressing sexual violence. Burke said she recognizes that sexual assault and harrassment can impact anyone, but that not everyone’s experiences are equally addressed.
“The thing that everyone should understand is that sexual violence does not discriminate,” she said. “The response to it does.”
Burke also discussed how the public should prioritize talking about sexual violence, given that the current social justice climate is focused on racial injustice, police brutality and the election.
The rise of social media and sound bytes, Burke said, has shortened our attention span. Nonetheless, Burke added, people must recognize that the social issues of the moment, like racial justice, do not exist in a vacuum; they are deeply connected to sexual violence.
“I’m almost mortified by the number of people who have said things to me like ‘Well, this is not a moment to think about MeToo; we really have to focus on Black lives,’” Burke said. “You cannot have a conversation about racial justice in this country that’s not connected to sexual violence, to gender-based violence. Those things are inextricably linked.”
While discussing her approach to change, Burke urged young organizers not to be discouraged by small attendance numbers at meetings or events. Instead, she said, this generation’s activists should focus on thinking “outside the box” and making use of resources and technology to meet people’s emotional needs.
“When you’re doing work like this, this is not just hard work but this is heart work,” Burke said. “And so we have to think about our basic needs bigger than food, clothing and shelter.”
Not everyone will serve at the front lines, Burke added, but people in all professions should push for diversity and social justice within their fields. She called on non-activists to “be grounded” in the humanity of people who have experienced sexual assault and other victims of violence.
“I need you to be grounded in the humanity of these people who have been pushed to the margins,” Burke said.
In the Q&A session, Burke discussed the difficulties of organizational work and the importance of self-care for activists.
“Taking care of yourself is doing the work,” Burke said. “Don’t let anybody guilt you or make you feel different, make you feel lazy, make you feel less than because you will come back, refreshed and ready. We don’t want people who are tired and believe beleaguered at the front line.”
Burke also said she does not want the public to designate her as the figurehead of the #MeToo movement forever. She challenged PBHA students and the audience to push back on the ideas of older generations of activists, including her own.
“You should be like, ‘I listened to Tarana Burke. She sounded good, but it made me think of a better and different way we can do that,’” Burke said. “That’s what I need you to be committed to: what’s better, what’s next, what’s necessary, because this journey is long. It’s long. We’re gonna be on it for a long time so we have to keep it fresh.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students and organizations are preparing for the first Harvard-Yale virtual spirit week, set to take place between Nov. 15 and Nov. 22.
In lieu of the annual Harvard-Yale football game, which was cancelled this year due to the pandemic, the Harvard College Events Board has planned a week of virtual events and social media challenges to keep students connected across the world. While Crimson Jam usually occurs at the beginning of the year on campus, this year the spirit week will culminate in the concert, featuring R&B star Giveon as the headline act as well as a plethora of student performances.
Jessica H. Chaidez ’21, an event organizer and member of CEB, said she is excited to host the events, which have been in the works since summer.
“This is all kind of part of a long, long process,” Chaidez said. “All the events I’d say started early this semester, but because of COVID everything was just so up in the air. So finalizing things has definitely come in recent months, but this has been a long time coming.”
While the pandemic has thrown many college organizations for a loop, CEB leaders are excited to unveil their plans after some trial and error that occurred last semester.
“All our plans kind of revolved around COVID, and that interfered with our communications, working with our vendors, that’s interfering with what events you want to do,” Chaidez said. “But again, I think through practice we’ve kind of been better and been smarter about how to work through this virtual world.”
Aside from CEB hosting events throughout the week, different social organizations are linking with their Yale counterparts to host club-specific events as well.
Christian Malachy M. Porter ’23, vice president of the Black Pre-Med Society and programming manager of the Black Students Association, said the BSA teamed up with its Yale equivalent to fund cash prizes and other incentives for members to participate in events that took place this weekend.
“This past Friday, we had UberEats vouchers that we raffled off to people who RSVPed, so we gave out four different UberEats vouchers. And then for our Jeopardy team game, we had different cash prizes for the first, second and third place teams, and I think it worked pretty well, people were excited,” Porter said. “It was definitely competitive and people showed up because they wanted to win the cash prizes.”
Although the virtual events substituted the actual game, students said they were disappointed with the cancellation of in-person festivities.
“In terms of Harvard-Yale being cancelled, I was not really surprised about it. I kind of had assumed it was cancelled from the start of the semester given the restrictions that both Harvard and Yale had already implemented,” Lev S. Sandler ’23 said. “I’m definitely sad about it, but I understand completely why it was cancelled.”
Mihir U. Gowda ’23 said he too was upset about the cancellation of this year’s game, especially compared to his “fun” experience last year.
“Tied in with the whole semester being cancelled, it’s like a huge bummer,” he said. “Last year, going to Harvard-Yale was a fantastic series that week. It was just like a lot of fun. I participated in the flag football thing, and it was a lot of fun and just like meeting new people from Yale.”
Students also indicated that they may not participate in the Harvard-Yale virtual spirit week because they simply did not know about it.
“I didn’t really know that that existed,” Sandler said. “So no, I don’t think I will attend. I don’t really know what’s happening for it and I think it would just remind me of what we’re missing out on.”
Gowda agreed.
“I haven’t been too invested in checking my emails for online Zoom events just because you have socials,” Gowda added.
Some students said they are far more concerned about the prospect of next year’s game than this year’s virtual spirit week.
“I think I’m more interested to know about what Harvard and Yale’s plans for the future of what it will look like,” Sandler said. “Like will it happen again in the future? Will there be changes? Who will host the next game? Small questions in the grand scheme of COVID, but still things I’m curious about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of Harvard’s custodial staff called on the University to guarantee it would not lay off workers in the spring in two rallies held last week, as institutions of higher education across the U.S. reckon with the economic crisis precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The protests started Thursday and continued into Friday, growing in numbers after the Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp announced a new policy on emergency excused absences to staff Thursday.
Under the policy, workers directly employed by Harvard can use emergency excused absences to maintain 70 percent of their regular pay if their job has seen cuts — but contracted workers cannot.
This announcement struck a sour note with the roughly 300 custodians on campus who are contracted by Harvard but directly work for different employers.
32BJ — the local branch of the Service Employees International Union, which covers hundreds of campus custodial staff — organized the rallies. Roxana Rivera, vice president of 32BJ SEIU, released a media advisory ahead of the initial rally Thursday expressing discontent with the University for neglecting its custodial staff.
“The 1,000 essential workers we represent at Harvard, including hundreds of custodians, have risked their lives throughout this pandemic to keep this community clean, safe, and healthy,” Rivera wrote. “As the pandemic drags on, these custodians need their jobs more than ever. As a major employer for Cambridge and surrounding communities, Harvard needs to step up and protect the jobs whole families are depending on.”
She also wrote that, given the University’s large endowment and financial reserves, it should offer the same protections to all its workers, whether directly employed or contracted.
Harvard has provided full pay and benefits to contract and direct hire employees since March during the pandemic and subsequent economic fallout, and all workers – contract and direct hires – will continue to be fully supported until at least Jan. 15, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
At the onset of the pandemic, the University agreed to guarantee workload protections to all of its staff, regardless of type of employment. However, as their finances faced more strain, this decision had to be reversed, and the school was unable to offer similiar protections to all employees, according to Lapp’s announcement. Lapp wrote that contracted workers would have to turn to their own employers for the same job security, as providing the benefit to them does not fall under Harvard’s purview.
“In those limited instances in which Schools or Units determine the need to maintain current service levels or increase them due to anticipated spring semester needs, excused emergency absence may be extended as necessary by their employers to sustain regular pay of contract workers,” Lapp wrote.
The announcement from Lapp is only the latest concern at Harvard for 32BJ SEIU, which is contending with a Nov. 15 expiration date on its current contract with the University.
The union pressed the University to grant a one-year extension to the existing contract, prioritizing providing immediate, short-term job security to essential workers in the midst of the pandemic. Harvard administrators agreed to the extension but did not agree to a guarantee of no layoffs.
Various political leaders and labor activists spoke out in support of the custodians at the rallies, saying they are concerned that Harvard’s labor practices are unfair. Massachusetts State Representative Marjorie C. Decker spoke at one of the rallies, expressing solidarity with the custodians and demanding Harvard commit to securing work for all its employees through the pandemic.
U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) also voiced support for Harvard’s contracted employees in a tweet responding to a Boston Globe article Sunday afternoon.
“Harvard needs to do the right and just thing and extend COVID-19 worker protections for contracted staff,” the tweet reads.
Paula Martinez, a contracted custodian at the Harvard Business School, said she was dismayed by the fact that Harvard had not guaranteed her and her contracted coworkers the same job security as the directly-employed staff.
“Many of our co-workers, including myself, depend on this job to sustain their families as well,” Martinez said. “Our goal overall has been no layoffs, one year extension, and a fair treatment for all my coworkers.”
She said she wants the University to hear her concerns and acknowledge the amount of help contracted custodians have provided over the past few months.
“We are going to continue fighting until we get our voice heard,” Martinez said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 16, 2020, at 12:28 p.m.
The former fencing coach and Harvard College parent at the heart of an admissions scandal which embroiled Harvard Athletics in spring 2019 were arrested on Monday and charged with bribery, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office District of Massachusetts.
The University dismissed the coach, Peter Brand, in July 2019, after The Boston Globe reported that he sold his home to Jie “Jack” Zhao — a Maryland resident and parent of one then-current Harvard fencer and one former Harvard fencer — for hundreds of thousands of dollars above its market value. His dismissal came after Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay launched an investigation in April.
Brand allegedly accepted roughly $1.5 million to “facilitate” the admission of Zhao’s two sons to Harvard, per the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s press release.
Brand and Zhao will both make appearances in federal court, in Boston and Greenbelt, Md., respectively.
In an emailed statement, Zhao's attorney Bill Weinreb wrote that Zhao will fight the charges in court.
"Jack Zhao’s children were academic stars in high school and internationally competitive fencers who obtained admission to Harvard on their own merit," he wrote. "Both of them fenced for Harvard at the Division One level throughout their college careers. Mr. Zhao adamantly denies these charges and will vigorously contest them in court.”
Brand's attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday morning.

Being a freshman is tough. Being an international freshman is tougher. Being a remote international freshman starting your college experience online in the middle of a pandemic in an election year is possibly the worst combination. And although we appreciate the looks of awe and well-meaning pity when other students find out that we do, in fact, stay up for 12 a.m. classes and 3 a.m. club meetings, try out these better conversation starters than, “Woah, what time is it over there?” to chat up the international freshmen in your Zoom class or club.
Anything food related 
“What’s your favorite food?” is a safe question to start the conversation. Everyone loves good food, and it's a pretty universal topic to kick off a spicy (or salty) conversation. International students take great pride in having amazing cuisines in their home countries and love talking about them! From Korean barbeque to Anjera (sour flatbread) to Murg Makhani (butter chicken) to Wali wa nazi (coconut rice), international students have a wealth of cuisines they’re willing and happy to share.
Best places to visit in their country
We can only speak for African tourism, but in case you’re wondering: We have, in fact, seen a lion — multiple times, sometimes outside on the street right next to our acacia tree. We’re joking. Talking about all the cool underrated things to do in your country outside popular tourist activities is a breath of fresh air from the clichés we always hear about. From white water rafting, to cave diving, to waterfall bungee jumping, to snake taming, international students have some pretty cool stories to tell if only you ask. We could tell you about the time we kissed a giraffe, but instead let's talk about that one time your neighbor's uncle’s cousin's girlfriend went on a safari in the Savannah (another joke). As much as we appreciate the tourism revenue, we know you know.
Music
“What's your favourite song/album/artist?” is a nice, mildly interesting question. Talking about music can go many different ways — either you’ll bond over the musical genius that is Dua Lipa’s “Nostalgia” or disagree over Beyoncé’s latest album. Music is a great way to get people talking and connect through Spotify playlists. Another bonus is you never know what new cool genre you could discover!
Hobbies
Hobbies are a great way to find similarities and common interests to start a budding friendship. International students are pretty impressive, so don’t be surprised if you find out someone is a nationally acclaimed athlete, artist, musician, or Math Olympiad gold medalist. Hobbies are a nice way to bridge the gap between you and the other person; despite differences in culture, you’re both teenagers finding your way through college and life.
Weather
If you’re really struggling to find a topic, and the breakout room doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon, you can always rely on good ol’ weather to save the day. A simple, “So how is the weather where you are?” could be a good start. Weather is a universally boring topic, so hopefully someone saves you from that awkward conversation. With autumn in full swing, feel free to drop in a few anecdotes about your favorite seasonal activities or drinks. Snow stories are another crowd pleaser, especially among us tropical and equatorial weather people.
Languages
Chances are, if you are speaking to an international student, English isn’t their first language, so you can always ask them to teach you a few words or phrases in their home language. While this won’t get you a pass out of your language requirement, you can at least learn something that you can use to flex on your friends. However, we can’t guarantee that you won’t meet a cheeky international student who will trick you into thinking that you are saying, “Hi, my name is ___,” in their home language when you are actually saying some sort of profanity. While that is something we would be tempted to do, we generally avoid it.
Traditions and customs
A great way to learn more about an international student and their background is to ask them about traditions and customs from their home countries. International students would love to share the best parts of their home culture — you might find something you have in common or learn something new about a different country.
Americanisms
Most international students grew up watching American media, so we know quite a lot about American culture. Americans can sometimes seem like strange creatures to us internationals, so we might find some of your “Americanisms” a bit weird. Feel free to ask us what we find confusing about Americans, you’ll probably get some interesting responses. Like, what is with your obsession with seasons? Why do you hang American flags everywhere? What is so special about pumpkin spice? Why do you write your dates wrong? What’s up with daylight savings? Chances are you might find yourselves a bit weird too.
In our completely unbiased opinion, international students are the best part of Harvard. You will probably have many interesting and fruitful conversations with any international student you meet. We love it when other students show an interest in our cultures and backgrounds, and we love learning more about our American peers. Feel free to distract us from our time difference and remote learning struggles by using these conversation starters to get some good conversations going!
