After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There comes a time for every adolescent when they begin to contemplate exactly what they want to do in life. For me, soon after I turned sixteen, I began anxiously looking at the future, taking stock of everything I’d done in my short life. My passions, my hobbies, my as-yet undefined college choices: all were methodically arranged into columns before me, of varying interests and potential career and life paths. Yet try as I might, I could not come up with anything I really cared about.
From that point, I began turning to the past—literature, music and art—to see what was truly fulfilling. I read W. Somerset Maugham’s "Of Human Bondage" and "The Razor’s Edge", two amazing books that detail the struggle for fulfillment in life amidst a judgmental, often hostile society, without the saccharine sentimentality that tends to characterize books of that nature. To follow up, I read "Walden" and "Self-Reliance", and listened to "Pippin", thus firmly cementing me as a typical misunderstood teenager searching for meaning in anything that offered answers and hope.
I entered Harvard thinking I would change dramatically and become a new person, driven by new goals, and truly find out who I would be. So far, that goal has proved evasive, though, granted, I’ve only been a student for one semester. I spent the past winter perusing Crimson Careers, the Office of Career Services, and Harvard’s study abroad websites, anxiously looking for a golden opportunity that I could apply for, and found very little I could get interested in. It created a sense of frenetic awkwardness in me for a few days, being unable to decide what I wished to do.
I won’t deny that being on a campus where everyone seems to be so effortlessly involved in intense activities and groups is daunting at times; not because of the work, but because of the unspoken assurance that everyone seems to know what they are doing. I do keep in mind that I’m not competing with others, and I have no desire to. Why, then, am I so apprehensive?
This uncertainty must run deeper in our community than we realize. I used to think the stereotype of everyone going to Harvard, graduating, and entering a lucrative career in either finance or consulting was just that: a stereotype. And while in many ways it is very much that, I have lost count of all the times I have talked to fellow freshmen or upperclassmen, or attended club, career and OCS meetings and heard those twin words uttered repeatedly as futures for us students: “finance and consulting.”
As much as it may just be misleading (after all, less than half—about 40 percent—of all Harvard students actually pursue finance or consulting careers), it’s something that I often consider. Lest it seem that I’m condemning these specific career paths and the students who choose them, I am firmly not. There are many students who pursue such life goals and find fulfillment and enrichment in their lives. It just doesn’t seem an option I want to pursue, but neither do so many other things.
“Enter to grow in wisdom,” the words above Dexter Gate on Mass. Ave. remind me, every time I walk through its pillars, on my way in, and “Depart to better serve thy country and thy kind,” on my way out. I’d like to imagine that “thy kind,” first and foremost, begins with the individual self. How can I begin to serve others if I know not how best to serve myself?
That’s the question I have put forward for myself as I continue forward: a metaphorical razor’s edge that I’m trying to pass over, unscathed. I only hope that I will succeed. Harvard seems to know the answers, or at least will give me a way to find them. I only have to trust in the future, as cliché as it sounds. But it might be true—I will only have to wait and see.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s House system was established in 1930 as a means of combating socioeconomic stratification in off-campus housing. Since then, it has continually progressed in different forms as a means of unifying the student body. Most recently, in 1995, after concerns about students self-segregating along racial and religious lines, the College implemented a system of assigning freshmen blocking groups randomly to Houses in the spring semester. Today, however, it is time for the next step. With an increasingly diverse student body and newly focused attention on exclusive social organizations and student happiness, the House system holds the potential to truly unite and serve the College. To do so, however, House systems must be expanded to include students from the moment they arrive at Harvard.
Harvard ranked 25th out of 31 elite schools, behind Yale, in a survey of student satisfaction, lagging particularly in student evaluations of social life on campus and sense of community. These problems have their roots in the very beginnings of student life for freshmen, when groups and communities begin to form. Without the grounding and support offered by a House, finding community is a challenge.
It is during freshman year, of course, that social and blocking groups form. A unifying House system would discourage the formation of groups based on economic and social statuses. Instead, students would feel encouraged to find friends from within their House rather than from their high school, religious background, region of the country, or race, knowing that they would be together for their time at Harvard.
Such a system would be particularly beneficial for inner-city, poor, minority and first-generation students at Harvard, who have expressed struggles transitioning to the environment in the College. These students often do not know anyone coming into college and need guidance. With dedicated upperclassmen, House resources and a group of peers much smaller than the entire freshman class, the transition to the College for these students will be eased, and inequity among backgrounds will be combated.
If this change seems unusual or improbable, it is valuable to look at Yale. The residential college system there is similar to Harvard’s House system, except students are randomly assigned to a residential college before arriving as freshmen. Yale, too, has its own version of final clubs—secret societies—and there are fraternities and sororities as well. Though they are arguably far less pervasive and pernicious, there has been little to no outcry against them, with the administration actually seeking closer ties in recent months.
By creating a community early on, a freshman-inclusive House system will discourage students from filling the void with exclusive single-gender organizations. Lamenting a current lack of student unity and social interaction, a student wrote in The Crimson, “Freshman spring, I joined a sorority because I wanted to find community at Harvard.” There, close-knit bonds and social venues are promised. However, accusations of exclusivity, sexual assault, and a pernicious influence on the overall College environment are rampant. In response, the College administration is preparing to impose sanctions on participating students, but these are unlikely to truly solve the problem of exclusivity and a lack of social venues.
The key to this is choice, with students at Harvard lacking a vibrant House social life and turning to other means for it. Freshmen, however, would be more likely to invest in House activities, developing the close-knit bonds across blocking groups that defines Yale’s system. Indeed, this would level the playing field, providing social opportunities even for those students not wealthy or well-connected enough to join a single-gender social organization. It would also be a powerful way to combat those organizations, as their prevalence would be challenged.
There will of course be students who find close friends with whom they want to live outside of this proposed system. Perhaps an option to transfer Houses would be warranted. Additionally, to preserve the experience of freshmen in the Yard, it would likely work best to assign a dorm or section of a dorm to one specific House, so freshmen live alongside their House-mates while still together as a class in the Yard.
Ultimately, however, beyond the elimination of blocking drama and diminishing of social organization influence, including freshmen in the House system will invite the creation of powerful House communities. No student will block alone, and every freshman—regardless of socioeconomic background, wealth or high school—will be welcomed from the start. In the historical progress of the Houses as components of Harvard’s fight against vestiges of institutionalized social, racial, and religious inequity, this is the next important step.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The day after the presidential inauguration, hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children took to the streets in Women’s Marches across the country, a “grassroots effort” that, in the words of the official national platform, featured “nationally recognized advocates, artists, entertainers, entrepreneurs, [and] thought leaders”. For many individuals, these marches served as an affirmation of women’s rights in the face of the Trump administration. For others, they served as a direct protest of his presidency. Regardless of the reasons people had for participating, the widespread support of the marches demonstrate that there are a significant number of people opposed to Trump’s political agenda.
The marches are a critical showing that joins a broad history of civil protest in the United States, with turnout rates estimated to be higher than those at Trump’s inauguration the day before. We commend participants of the women’s marches across the country, and are encouraged that these events were able to bring together both activist groups as well as citizens who are less politically engaged.
That said, one of the most worrying aspects of the marches was how differently the media portrayed these marches compared to similar civil rights protests that have transpired in recent years.
Even though the Women’s Marches were hailed by many as an affirmation of women’s rights, some criticized the marches for being too narrow in its scope. Additionally, while it was an important showing, it is concerning to see that similar Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ Pride events have received different coverage.
Black Lives Matter, in particular, has been branded as an extremist group by some in the media for staging similar marches and protests in similar calls for equal rights. We hope that the media critically reconsiders the way they cover demonstrations, especially given the controversial and inflammatory nature of many Trump administration platforms. Coverage must be done in a balanced and fair way with respect to all racial and socioeconomic groups.
Despite some criticism that the platform of the Women’s Marches was not sufficiently inclusive, we recognize the enthusiasm that people worldwide had for the marches and that they were able to bring many different communities together. However, we regret that the same levels of enthusiasm and support were not evident a few months earlier, when we had the opportunity to break the glass ceiling and elect our first woman president.
Even though people participated in the marches for a variety of reasons, we are hopeful that they brought together a diverse cross-section of individuals. This strong show of unity should not stop after the marches. People should take this opportunity to continue collaboration between marginalized communities, especially in the face of a president who has repeatedly criticized different minority groups. While the Women’s Marches should be the starting point for a fight for civil rights, the fight will be insufficient if it is not intersectional. Until people of every race, creed, and identity are included and remembered in the fight, organizers, activists, and citizens will still have work to do in ensuring equal opportunity for all Americans. Continued collaboration will be essential in order to successfully advocate for change.

A fund established by the Office of Student Life will support events that multiple student groups organize together, offering grants of up to $3,000 for undergraduate organizations to host “inclusive” campus-wide social events.
The OSL’s “leadership development” programs—including the “Collaboration and Innovation Grant”—is the latest initiative in the College’s ongoing bid to strengthen on-campus social life. The new fund will support events and programs focusing on professional development, social activities, and academic initiatives.
Undergraduate student organizations, academic departments, House Committees, and individual groups of students are eligible to apply for grants from the fund. Events must be collaborations between student organizations, Houses, or University partners, and be free and open to all undergraduates.
According to Assistant Dean of Student Life Alexander R. Miller, the fund was the “brainchild” of several conversations that occurred during the College’s fall initiative to provide more on-campus social spaces.
In recent years, the College has increased its funding for undergraduate social life  as unrecognized social groups like final clubs and fraternities face increased scrutiny.Last academic year, efforts included providing funding for the [BLANK] Party, a College-wide Halloween party, a five-floor party in Winthrop House, and pre-Yardfest neighborhood block parties.
The College Dean’s office increased funding for undergraduate social activities by 73 percent between 2014 and 2016, with another 15 percent increase budgeted for this academic year.
“It has been made clear to our office, through student consultation and active listening, that students are looking for opportunities to create their own Harvard College community through the expansion of their student groups,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement.
Administrators have faced scrutiny in their attempts to reform unrecognized single-sex social organizations, with some faculty members and students saying they should not have a large role in dictating students’ activities outside the classroom.
Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair said in September that she hopes to provide students with resources to plan events, then “get out of the way.” The recently announced leadership development programs represent the first major initiative for the OSL since O’Dair took the office’s helm in August last year.
Other newly-announced OSL “leadership development” programs include “Catalyst”—a workshop meant to sharpen students’ leadership skills—and a Student Leader Recognition Night, which will honor nominated students “for all their contributions to campus and student life.”
The new OSL grant comes a year after the Undergraduate Council introduced a similar initiative to incentivize student group collaboration throughout the College. Last year, then-UC President Shaiba Rather ’17 said the body would “favor collaborative efforts” when considering applications for its “Grant for an Open Harvard College.” Additionally, the body’s finance committee later approved additional legislation—a “Club Collaboration Bonus”—for their separate grant process when an increase in funding requests necessitated cuts to allocations last spring.
“I think the impetus of many of these grants, and the OSL one, too, is to get these student groups to interact with one another such as different cultural groups or different political groups,” UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18 said. “We established our grants to get the huge amount of diverse groups we have on campus to come together for social or learning events.”
Miller added that several student organizations have already expressed interest in applying for the grant since its inception at the end of the semester.
“It is our hope to further advertise this funding opportunity as the spring 2017 semester begins, in order to continue to support the community-shaping student organizations that are so vital to our campus culture,” Miller wrote.

Proponents of ethnic studies at Harvard coordinated advocacy efforts and discussed the field’s fraught history at a Wintersession workshop entitled “Ethnic Studies: Past, Present, and Future” Friday.
At the event, students and alumni emphasized the need to recruit new ethnic studies advocates, as many of the movement’s organizers will soon graduate.
While the push for an ethnic studies program at Harvard is not new, the Wintersession workshop was the first of its kind, according to workshop organizer Diana K. Nguyen ’15. Most recently, a group of students circulated a petition in November calling for the creation of an ethnic studies department and research center, as well as more faculty in the field.
According to organizer Itzel L. Vasquez-Rodriguez ’17, the Wintersession workshop is a continuation of  a discussion started at an October “teach-in” co-sponsored by Concilio Latino, Native Americans at Harvard College, and the Task Force for Asian and Pacific American Studies. At the teach-in, Nguyen presented research on the history of activism for ethnic studies at Harvard, discussing past proposals for ethnic studies programs that the University rejected.
“[The Wintersession workshop was] looking toward a future-oriented action, rather than the teach-in, which was very much past-focused,” she said. Nguyen and other organizers brainstormed potential allies for their cause and next steps in their path to advocating for an ethnic studies program.
In an email last fall, College spokesperson Rachael Dane noted the existence of academic departments and programs such as African and African American Studies; East Asian Languages and Civilizations; and Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, as well as the secondary field in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights. Dane could not be reached for comment on Sunday.
Tessa L. Desmond, the administrative director of the Committee on Ethnicity, Migration, Rights, spoke about current offerings in ethnic studies at the University.
"We are uniquely poised to develop a program that might be a national leader on [ethnic studies],” she said. EMR currently cross-lists various ethnic studies courses from around the University and offers an undergraduate secondary degree.
Shelly C. Lowe, executive director of the Harvard University Native American Program, also spoke to attendees about the history of Native American program and made the case for an program in indigenous studies. The program operates out of the University President and Provost offices and aims to promote the study of indigenous culture.
Student attendees also spent the morning and afternoon discussing how students could serve as effective advocates for an expanded ethnic studies program.
“I think what we’ve seen so far has been very informative and [lays] a good groundwork for how we go about advocating for this work, because a large part of it is knowing what you’re advocating for and why and what the history has been here,” Vasquez-Rodriguez said.
Because Vazquez-Rodriguez and Juhwan Seo ’17, one of the effort's leaders, will both be graduating in the spring, they are looking for the next generation of ethnic studies advocates, Vazquez-Rodriguez said.
“We’re hoping to keep this as a continuous movement especially after some of the main organizers graduate,” she said. “So we’re looking to actively mentor younger students and make sure this continues beyond graduation for us.”

Colin A. Mochrie, a Canadian comedian best known for his role on the show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?”, performed with Harvard’s Immediate Gratification Players Sunday night as the improvisational comedy troupe’s 2017 Player of the Year.
Mochrie has been a series regular on both the British and American versions of “Whose Line Is It Anyway?”, and will star in the fifth season of its revival on The CW this summer.
“He's the best and most well known improviser ever known,” said Adam S. Wong ‘17, one of the troupe’s players. “He can do everything. He can do the funny and he can be the funny.”
“Performing with him was definitely kind of a dream,” Wong continued.
At the beginning of the show, players presented Mochrie with a fake Harvard diploma, a Harvard sweatshirt, and the signature red and yellow tie worn by all members of the group during performances, declaring him an honorary member of the troupe.
The show was performed in “Armando” form, in which Mochrie performed monologues based on words suggested by audience members—including “liver,” “shoe,” and “lasagna”—then improvised skits with the full troupe inspired by the monologue. In his monologues, Mochrie reflected on his life and experience as a comedian.
Mochrie and the troupe put on the show to a large and lively crowd. Once seats filled up in the Science Center, students continued to seat themselves in the aisles of the lecture hall.
“It was a lot of fun,” said Anthony Munson ’19, who attended the show. “The overall synergy between Mochrie and the players was great.”
The Player of the Year award was started by IGP in 2010 as a way to honor famous comedians. Previous honorees have included other notable comedians like “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander, sketch comedian Keegan-Michael Key, and Mochrie’s “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” co-star Wayne Brady. Most recently, the group honored actor Nick Offerman, known for his role as Ron Swanson on the NBC sitcom “Parks and Recreation,” as its 2016 Player of the Year.

When President Donald Trump placed his hand on the bible to take the oath of office Jan. 20, Jonathan S. Roberts ’17 and Emily M. Hall ’18 both stood within a few thousand yards of the president. Both had traveled to Washington, D.C. for the inauguration—but they came for very different reasons.
Hall, a conservative and a member of the Harvard Republican Club, wrote in an email that she was in D.C. to “witness history.” Roberts came to protest it.
Hall, who said she did not support Trump during his campaign, watched the swearing-in of the 45th president from the U.S. Capitol grounds, having obtained a ticket from her state’s senator, Democrat Chris Murphy of Conn. Being “immersed in a historic moment” first-hand was like nothing she had ever experienced, Hall wrote.
Roberts was not watching. Instead, he stood outside the U.S. Navy Memorial Plaza with hundreds of other protesters, waiting to join a large anti-Trump demonstration held within. As he lent his voice to chants of “No Trump! No KKK! No fascist USA!”, he said he felt the “tangible” energy of those around him.
Across the country Friday, Harvard students and professors watched Trump assume the presidency with a wide array of emotions. Some hailed his inauguration as the start of a new political era, while many others took to the streets the next day in repudiation of Trump’s fledgling administration.
Hall and Roberts were not the only Harvard students who journeyed to D.C. for the inauguration. Several members of the Republican Club also attended the ceremony, many using tickets provided by the Institute of Politics, club president Kent Haeffner ’18 said. The Republican Club vowed to withhold support from Trump in August.
Roberts said he helped organize transport for roughly 30 Harvard students, mostly undergraduates, who joined the anti-Trump protests held Jan. 20.
“I’ve spoken to a lot of people, many of whom this was their first time doing some type of protest action, and they were really grateful that they went, so I’m glad that we were able to get a group down,” Roberts said of the trip.
He said his interactions with Trump supporters at the event, many of them wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats, were mostly peaceful, despite media reports of violence. The experience helped to “humanize what Trump support looks like,” he said.
Roberts returned to Harvard that night, joining millions of people the next day in the “Boston Women’s March for America,” a local component of a nationwide demonstration meant to advocate women’s rights in the wake of Trump’s inauguration.
Eliza R. Ennis ’19 also took part in the protests Jan. 21, leading a contingent of roughly 15 undergraduates to the D.C. component of the march on a trip she planned weeks in advance. She said the experience made her feel she was a part of history.
“Being able to march through Washington, D.C., where we had all of the district’s historical buildings around us, shed great light on the fact that we were marching in kind of a line of historical protests and that we were standing up for what we believed in,” she said.
Back on campus, some students watched the ceremonies at the IOP’s watch party, held Jan. 20 in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum. Most in the audience were silent, and some wiped away tears as Trump repeated the oath of office. Prior to the election, just six percent of surveyed Harvard undergraduates planned to vote for Trump, according to The Crimson’s election survey.
When the newly minted president finished speaking, someone in the forum started clapping, but stopped quickly when no one joined in. The roughly 200 people gathered in the IOP dispersed soon after the event.
One attendee, Seth Towns ’20, said it “hurt” to watch Obama leave the White House. Towns said the 44th president and Harvard Law graduate had been a personal hero from a young age.
“It’s hard seeing someone like Donald Trump come in as president,” he said. “The president is inevitably going to be somebody who kids all around America look up to, and so with that you have to carry the responsibility of being an exceptional citizen.”
Towns added: “I just don’t see that in Donald Trump. That’s my honest opinion."
Some at the IOP expressed particular disappointment with Trump’s inaugural speech. Taras Holovko ’20, who also attended the watch party, said he thought Trump’s speech failed to unite the country after what he termed “a really hateful and intense campaign season.”
Alexander J. Cullen ’18, a Trump supporter and member of the Harvard Republican Club who watched the inauguration with his family at home, took the opposite view. He said he was pleased with the speech, calling it as “short” and “strong.”
“He didn’t sugarcoat anything, he spoke very openly and forthrightly against the establishment,” Cullen said of Trump. “It was pretty much an echo of what he said throughout his campaign.”
Reflecting on the weekend, Roberts said one particular moment stood out most to him. He remembered watching as one protester approached a Trump supporter in D.C. and struck up a conversation.
Minutes later, the Trump supporter smiled, said, “Well, I think we’re in different places,” and walked pointedly away, Roberts recounted.
“That sums up where we are as a nation right now,” he said. “It was really just an encounter of two worlds.”
UPDATED: January 23, 2017 at 8:49 p.m.
In late August 2016, Harvard stem cell researcher Lee L. Rubin received two orders from the Middlesex County Superior Court.
First, he must stay at least 100 feet away from his graduate student and dissertation advisee Gustavo German. And second, he must do so while simultaneously providing German with space and the necessary resources to conduct research in his lab.
The order, which Rubin has sought to stay, was the latest development in an academic relationship between Rubin and German marred by an involuntary psychiatric evaluation, court-ordered separation, and an ongoing legal battle.
Less than a year ago, the situation between German and Rubin was not so fraught. After accusations that Rubin had falsified data and conducted a“campaign of retaliation” against German, though, the two men find themselves working in the same lab but legally unable to be in the same room without a chaperone.
Harvard has not stood idly by as two of its affiliates battle in court. Concerned that Rubin cannot physically occupy and operate his lab without violating a court order, the University has challenged the legal ruling separating the two men.
After months of rules complicating the operations at one of Harvard’s research labs, the legal dispute, first reported by Retraction Watch and Science Magazine, continues.
On June 3, Rubin spoke with a Harvard University Health Services clinician about his mentee, alleging that German seemed “paranoid” and “disheveled,” according to court documents. Hours later, at 1 a.m. on June 4, police escorted German to the hospital, where medical professionals gave him a mental health evaluation.
While Rubin says he was concerned for his student, who had stopped showing up to the lab, German alleges a different explanation for the researcher’s diagnosis of his behavior: revenge.
In court documents, German argues that the trouble began when he sent an email to University President Drew G. Faust in March 2016. In the email, German raised concerns about research misconduct, alleging that Rubin and two of his graduate students fabricated data. German alleges that Rubin ultimately learned of the email and suspected German was the author.
About a month before the forced mental examination in June, two graduate students in Rubin’s lab reported concerns about German’s behavior to M. William Lensch, the executive director of the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology.
Following the graduate students’ reported concerns, David Cardozo, a director of graduate studies at the Medical School, met with German and found him to be “completely reasonable," according to court documents.
But German stopped going to the lab on May 21, 2016 and cancelled a meeting with Cardozo and Rubin.
Two days after the involuntary mental examination, Cardozo told German he could not return to Rubin’s lab until all issues were “completely cleared up,” according to court documents.
The suspension prompted German to file a harassment complaint on June 8, 2016, and Superior Court Judge Elizabeth M. Fahey ruled in favor of German in a filing dated August 25, 2016. In the ruling, Fahey wrote that, based on the evidence, Rubin “willfully and maliciously engaged” in actions against German following German’s email to Faust. She argued that Rubin had directed the graduate students to approach Lensch with their concerns.
Fahey’s order included two stipulations: that Rubin stay 100 feet away from German and have no contact with him, and that German be “fully restored” to his position in the lab.
Shortly after the ruling, Rubin appealed the decision and filed a motion to “stay,” or halt, the order pending the appeal. The court denied the motion to stay on Oct. 14. It did, however, modify the order such that German and Rubin could be within 100 feet of each other, but could not have direct contact unless an approved chaperone was available.
Intensifying the legal battle, the court issued civil contempt proceedings against Rubin on Nov. 30 for “unnecessary delays in providing resources to German.” They also revised the order again, reinstating the stipulation that Rubin must stay 100 feet away from German.
German did not respond to request for comment for this article.
John F. Rooney III, a lawyer for Rubin, wrote in an email that “for more than three decades, Professor Rubin has been committed to developing lifesaving treatments and training the next generation of scientists.”
While Fahey has said in court that Rubin’s chances of a successful appeal are slim, he does have an important ally on his side—Harvard.
The University entered the legal battle supporting Rubin on Sept. 6, 2016. At a hearing on that date, counsel for the University presented Fahey with a memorandum claiming that the order placed an “unreasonable burden” on the students and fellows affiliated with the Rubin Lab. Furthermore, Harvard argued the order forced the Rubin Lab to ignore federal research stipulations.
The Rubin Lab, a stem-cell research laboratory at Harvard Medical School, is partially funded by federal research grants and private industry entities. As a condition of federal funding, regulations require the principal investigator—in this case, Rubin—be present in the laboratory for research. Harvard’s counsel argued that the court-ordered separation of 100 feet rendered Rubin unable to supervise research.
After the 100 foot restriction was revoked in an Oct. 14 revision of the court’s original order, Harvard began efforts to normalize operations at the Rubin Lab.
“We are helping facilitate Dr. Rubin’s compliance with the order, while ensuring that research programs in the lab continue unimpeded and that the studies of the student are fully supported,” University spokesperson David Cameron wrote in an email.
On Nov. 30, however, during a hearing at which Harvard was not allowed to participate, Fahey said she was frustrated with Harvard and Rubin’s inability to provide German with the necessary materials— including mice—to complete his Ph.D.
“Well, he doesn’t even have mice, and Harvard and Rubin have been aware of my order since August 25,” Fahey said at the hearing. “Three months later he doesn’t have the mice. Apparently, some mice were ordered two weeks ago. That’s too late.”
Fahey said that Harvard and Rubin had “not been compliant with the court order” despite her revision efforts to “accommodate as many people as [she] could.”
“I really don’t feel like I’ve been dealt with fairly. Not me,” Fahey said. “That the court is being disrespected is frankly how I feel.”
On Dec. 30, 2016, Rubin filed an appeal and moved to suspend the revised order and civil contempt proceedings. Harvard again defended Rubin on Jan. 13, 2017, filing briefs in support of Rubin and arguing that the court’s order would cause “irreparable harm” to students and researchers in the Rubin Lab.
“Harvard expects that its P.I.s will not merely operate their labs, but that they will take steps to promote the academic and career aspirations of their students and fellows,” the brief read. “Under the Order, these expectations cannot be met, damaging not only Harvard but also the dozens of individuals who are part of the Rubin Lab.”
German filed an opposition to both Rubin and Harvard’s filings, requesting that the Court “temporarily disbar” lawyers representing Harvard for this case due to their “lack of candor, dishonesty, and gross misrepresentation of material facts.”
While court proceedings will continue in the coming weeks, daily operations at the Rubin Lab remain complicated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another game, another win for the Harvard women’s basketball team (14-1, 2-0 Ivy).
The Crimson stretched their win streak to 14, the longest such streak in Division I behind top-ranked Connecticut’s record-breaking 92-game win streak, thanks to a 70-61 triumph on the road against Dartmouth.
Facing the Big Green (5-10, 0-2) just two weeks after their first encounter on January 7, coach Kathy Delaney-Smith’s team knew what to expect and executed their gameplan effectively. One Dartmouth spurt aside, Harvard was comfortable as it continued a perfect start to the Ancient Eight portion of its schedule.
“It definitely helps that you played them recently,” freshman point guard Katie Benzan said, “We know what we need to better next time and what we should do differently. We just improved on everything, I think, and that really helped.”
Benzan, the Crimson’s leading scorer with 17 points, started the game with a three-pointer, setting the tone offensively. Junior forward Kirby Porter and sophomore guard Madeline Raster added triples of their own in the first quarter as the two teams went back and forth.
An excellent defensive period allowed Harvard to pull away in the second quarter. Back-to-back jumpers by freshman forward Jeannie Boehm stretched the lead to five, 19-14, early in the frame before a three-pointer by Big Green junior guard Emily Slagle cut the lead to two with eight minutes remaining.
That would be Dartmouth’s last field goal of the quarter, however, as Raster shut down the hosts’ leading scorer, Kate Letkewicz. Meanwhile, six different players scored for the visitors in the second quarter as the Crimson entered halftime with a 29-20 lead.
“[Raster] is our defensive stopper,” Delaney-Smith said. “We put her on Letkewicz, and she got nothing. [Raster] did a phenomenal job. And she does it on the offensive side as well.”
As has been the trend, however, Harvard let its opponents back into the game through turnovers and poor rebounding. After a Benzan three-pointer restored the nine-point lead two minutes into the third quarter, the Big Green went on a 15-4 run to claim a 39-38 advantage. They were fueled by eight points from sophomore forward Isalys Quiñones, who led all scorers in the game with 18.
“We haven’t blown anyone out,” Delaney-Smith said. “Every single game has been close. We’ll get a double-digit lead and then we don’t handle the runs very well. I don’t know if that’s a product of our youth, I’m not sure, but we’ll keep trying to figure out how to get better at that.”
The Crimson, however, climbed out of its offensive rut and scored the last six points of the period to retake the lead, 44-39.
“Dartmouth gets up for us, and it was really an exciting game,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was closer than I wanted it to be, we should have been able to extend our lead. Every game has different shifts in momentum, and there was a stretch where we let them back in it.”
As they’ve done throughout the win streak, the visitors were resilient and relied on another ensemble performance to close out the game. With three players in double figures and a number contributing in small spurts, Harvard scored 26 points in the final quarter to keep Dartmouth at arms length. Despite struggling to hit its shots consistently, Harvard was combative defensively and on the glass, forcing Dartmouth into low-percentage shots in key moments.
“That’s how we won,” Delaney-Smith said. “We won on our defense, we won on our rebounding. Even down the stretch when they closed the gap, we just dug in and I thought our defense improved and we beat them to the rebounds and the 50-50 balls.”
With the win, the Crimson move to 29th in the national RPI rankings, one spot behind where they were on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard ski team kicked off its 2017 season at the St. Lawrence University Carnival. The two-day event was held at two venues in upstate New York—the cross-country racers competing at Lake Placid and the alpine team at Whiteface Mountain.
Racing in very competitive fields, stacked with current and former U.S. Ski Team members and the best collegiate racers from the 17 teams in the NCAA Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association, the Crimson finished in 10th place.
At the Mt. Van Hoevenberg cross-country ski trails in Lake Placid the EISA Nordic season began on Friday with a 1.5-kilometer classic sprint. The flat course led to highly competitive heats with tight qualification times.
In the women’s final, Harvard sophomore Nina Armstrong finished in seventh out of 96 racers with a time of 2:44. Fellow sophomore, Hannah Hardenbergh also finished in the top-15, crossing the finish just one second after Armstrong.
In the men’s classic sprint final, junior Haakon Sigurslid had a strong top-10 finish. Sigurslid was followed by senior Devlin Shea and freshman William Rhatigan in 40th and 55th overall, respectively.
On Saturday morning, the Nordic racing continued in Lake Placid with longer races featuring multiple challenging climbs and descents.
In the women’s 5k race, Hardenbergh led the the Crimson women with a strong 10th place finish. She was followed closely by senior Rachel Hampton and Armstrong in 21st and 25th, respectively. Freshman Tegan Thorley had a solid first collegiate race, completing the grueling course in 16:12 to grab 34th place.
On the men’s side, U23 World Championship qualifier Cal Deline from Dartmouth won the 10k race by a decisive seventeen seconds, finishing in 26:59. For Harvard, junior Connor Green led with a 56th place finish.
“It was a really strong start for our team. We had some very good performances that put our team into the top 5 and we are only going to get stronger as the season goes on,” Hampton said.  “I am very excited to see what we can do.”
Over at Whiteface Mountain, the venue for the 1980 Olympics, the Alpine carnival season began on Friday with a big win in the Giant Slalom race for Middlebury sophomore, Caroline Bartlett. Bartlett dominated both runs, winning by a combined margin of 3.89 seconds.
The Crimson women posted strong results in the GS race with junior Kelly Steeves taking 35th overall and freshman Courtney Clark finishing close behind in 52nd in her collegiate debut.
William St. Germain, from the University of Vermont, was the men’s GS collegiate victor.
On Saturday, the alpine racers battled rough conditions with thick fog and a deteriorating course.
In her first race representing the University of Vermont, former U.S. Ski Team member, Paula Moltzan won the women’s slalom.
Building on two successful seasons with a handful of second and third place finishes, Dartmouth Junior Brian Mclaughlin capitalized on his start position as the first racer on the course to take home the first EISA carnival win of his career.
“Conditions were tough because of warm temperatures and a dense fog overnight. The snow had a soft wet layer and still the hard layer a foot underneath. I was lucky enough to run first on the first run, so I could ski the line I wanted even though it was soft,” said Mclaughlin. “It was bumpy, just had to fight your way down.”
For ski racers used to an individual sport, the carnival circuit is a unique opportunity to compete in a team format.
“The carnival circuit is more of a team event than anything else in our sport,” Mclaughlin said.  The girls help us by slipping and carrying clothes and vice versa. It's cool to be racing directly for more than yourself.”
In the overall team competition for the SLU Carnival, Dartmouth finished first with a combined score of 961 points, followed by the University of Vermont..

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a long winter layoff, the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams took to the strips once again, this time in Queens, N.Y., where both squads competed in the annual St. John’s Invitational to kick off the 2017 spring season.
With both squads entering the day ranked seventh in the country, the Crimson men’s side (5-5) suffered close defeats and finished with a 1-4 match record against other top collegiate fencing programs, while the Harvard women (5-6) ended their day with a 2-3 match record.
WOMEN’S FENCING
Despite the constant presence of NCAA saber individual champion and Crimson co-captain Adrienne Jarocki—who fenced her way to her standard stellar performance with a plus-32 touch differential for the day—it was the foil squad that had a large impact on the team’s performance.
In Harvard’s two victories against Penn State and host St. John’s, the foil trio carried the group with records of 7-2 and 9-0, respectively. However, in the three defeats against Ohio State, Notre Dame, and Columbia, the same weapon finished with marks of 2-7, 3-6, and 2-7, respectively.
“The St. John’s Invitational is always the hardest and most competitive meet of the year,” co-captain Liana Yamin said. “There’s no easy person to fence there...it seemed that many of our losses were close 5-4 [defeats]. We were fencing really well—it just was a matter of having the right strategy against certain schools and maintaining our energy throughout the day.”
In customary fashion, the single-day competition featured some of the top fencing programs in the nation, with the Crimson’s three defeats coming at the hands of opponents ranked first through fourth in the nation, and victories against the fifth and 10th-ranked schools in the country.
“It’s important that we learn from this competition, [such as] keeping our energy levels up against the toughest competition against the NCAA and how to mentally prepare ourselves for challenges like that,” Yamin said.
MEN’S FENCING
Whereas in previous years, the deciding few bouts may have swung the Crimson’s way for the most part, that was certainly not the case this go around for the Harvard men.
The morning began with a head-to-head battle with host St. John’s, which ended in the Crimson’s first of two 14-13 losses for their day. Despite a strong foil showing with a record of 7-2, the other two weapons were unable to nab the remaining seven bout victories necessary for the team victory.
A 27-bout skirmish with Ohio State produced a similar result—while the foil trio posted a 6-3 mark, saber and épée could only put together records of 4-5 and 2-7, respectively, costing Harvard the early-season match.
“It’s definitely a learning experience,” junior co-captain Eric Zhao said. “These schools are all top-10 in the nation and the fact that we were one bout away [in multiple matches] proves that we’re right at their level...and just a few tweaks away from getting it right in the future.”
Notre Dame and Columbia defeated the Crimson by scores of 15-12 and 14-13, respectively, in close matches later on in the afternoon.
The Crimson’s lone win came against Penn State, with the saber squad carrying the group with a 7-2 bout record to prevent Harvard’s team performance from ending in an goose egg in the win column.
“These meets, as important as they are, aren’t what our ultimate goal is, which is doing well at Ivies and NCAAs,” Zhao said. “These are great tune-ups in terms of getting up to that level to perform well there. I think we’re going to peak at the right time…We know where we are, and we know we can peak at the right level.”
2016 United States Olympic Team saber competitor and now-sophomore Eli Dershwitz earned a plus-24 touch differential for his day to key Harvard’s saber group, but even his efforts were not enough to net the Crimson a winning record for the tournament.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the ninth time this season, an opponent threatened to blemish the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team’s perfect record. For the ninth time, the Crimson emerged unscathed.
No. 21 Harvard easily dispatched Boston College, 179-112, at Blodgett Pool on Saturday to keep its undefeated streak alive, snapping the Eagles’ (10-3) run of eight consecutive wins. The victory marks the third time in as many years that the Crimson (9-0, 5-0 Ivy League) has reached nine wins in a regular season.
Harvard rode a team-wide effort to secure the result, taking the top spot in every event en route to the victory. In the end, 12 different Crimson swimmers clocked winning times.
“This meet gave us all confidence that our hard work this season is paying off,” junior Koya Osada said. “Our legs are stronger, the endurance is there, and we realize that the bulk of our season is now behind us. More than anything, we're just excited to see how fast we can go this championship season and hopefully bring the Ivy League title back to Harvard.”
Harvard continued its run of strong performances in relay events, kicking off the meet by taking the top two spots in the 200 medley relay. Osada and junior Shane McNamara, senior Max Yakubovich, and sophomore Sebastian Lutz made up the winning lineup. Less than a second separated the Crimson ‘A’ squad from juniors Steven Tan and Luke Morgan-Scott, co-captain Eric Ronda, and freshman Raphael Marcoux, who beat out the top BC entry by nearly four seconds to take second place.
A number of the relay athletes would go on to add solo wins as well, beginning with Ronda, who picked up a victory in the 100 breaststroke. Lutz was close behind in second.
Marcoux collected an individual victory as part of a Harvard podium sweep in the 100 freestyle as well. The freshman touched the wall first in a time of 46.29, with sophomore Brennan Novak finishing second and senior Aly Abdel Khalik rounding out the top three.
Osada also swam to a win as the Crimson’s lone representative in the 200 backstroke. The Chapel Hill, N.C. native outpaced the second-place swimmer by almost 10 seconds.
In a meet that showcased Harvard’s depth, a number of athletes who did not compete in the top two relay lineups for the day raced to victory elsewhere.
Freshman Dean Farris and junior Ed Kim each picked up a pair of solo wins. The first-year beat out second-place Tan to claim victory in the 100 backstroke before adding a second win in the 500 freestyle.
Kim also edged out Tan in the 50 freestyle. Kim touched the wall first in 20.54, with his classmate less than three-tenths of a second back in second place.
“As we approach our championship meets, every opportunity we have to race is another chance to work on the small details that become crucial when we're talking about improving tenths and hundredths of a second in an event,” Osada said.
Kim would later contribute to the Crimson’s second podium sweep of the meet in the 100 butterfly. The Sammamish, Wash. native ended up first, as Morgan-Scott and Lutz finished in second and third places, respectively.
Sophomore Daniel Tran chipped in a win as well to add to Harvard’s margin of victory, taking top marks in the 1000 freestyle. Junior Jack Boyd was third in the race.
The Crimson’s efforts were also bolstered by victories in three 200-yard events: the freestyle, butterfly, and breaststroke. It was Novak who led the way in the 200 freestyle, with freshman Daniel Chang not far behind in second place.
Senior Christian Carbone claimed the top spot in the 200 butterfly in a time of 1:49.87. The West Des Moines, Iowa native finished more than four seconds ahead of the second-place finisher from BC.
Sophomore Alan Lam ended up in first in the 200 breast to complete the run of commanding Harvard performances. Co-captain Mitchell Foster took second place.
The Crimson dominated on the boards as well, as Harvard divers took the top two places in the three-meter event. Junior David Pfeiffer’s score of 337.43 earned him top marks, while classmate Bobby Ross finished second. The duo repeated the feat in an exhibition round of the one-meter dive, with Pfeiffer posting the top score and Ross earning the second-best mark.
The win will see Harvard enter its final regular meet of the season with a perfect record to defend and some momentum to its name.
“Everyone stepped up at this meet and performed well despite the fact that most of us didn't swim our best events,” Abdel Khalik said. “We have been able to keep the ball rolling all season long and so we are excited to see what we can do against Yale in two weeks.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard men’s volleyball team, there was no warm-up match to ease into the 2017 season. Rather, in mid-January the Crimson (1-3) suffered a rude introduction to its new campaign, as it made the trek to Chicago to see some of the best volleyball the country has to offer in top-10 teams Lewis and Loyola (Ill.), both of whom dealt Harvard losses.
The Crimson returned to Cambridge licking its wounds but nevertheless knew it would emerge all the better for the effort it put forth in Illinois. Kicking off a five-game home stand, Harvard hoped to show visiting Fort Wayne and Ball State a few newly learned tricks it picked up from its Chicago-based adversaries.
Harvard routed the still-winless Mastodons (0-8) in four sets on Thursday night and then concluded the double header the following evening with a 3-2 loss at the hands of the No. 13 Cardinals (5-1).
“Coming off an 0-2 start to the season,” co-captain Casey White said, “we wanted to get a better feel for how we’re going to fit in the league.”
Almost exactly a year ago, the Crimson visited both teams in a similar back-to-back format. Harvard fell short to Ball State 3-1 before it ended the road trip on a high note and trounced Fort Wayne in straight sets.
HARVARD 3, FORT WAYNE 1
The Crimson built upon its recent success at the Malkin Athletic Center by securing its first victory of the season there. With Thursday’s triumph, Harvard, having won seven of nine at the MAC last season, improved its home mark to 29-8 since 2014.
After the teams traded points throughout the first set, the Crimson barely escaped with the 28-26 victory, requiring win-by-two sudden death. With the score notched at 20, the receiving squad sided out 12 consecutive times down the stretch, giving way to a dramatic opening frame finish.
The only blemish in an otherwise consistent match for Harvard came in the third set. Trailing 22-21 and just four points from a clean sweep at the hands of the Crimson, Fort Wayne sided out and rode outside hitter Nick Smalter’s serve straight to 25. Two Harvard timeouts proved futile in halting the four-point rally, the longest scoring streak of the closely contested set.
“We’re a pretty young team,” White admitted. “I think we got a little tight at the end of the set, and when we get nervous, we tend to be a little predictable, like where the offense goes.”
Game three marked the only set in which the Mastodons outplayed the Crimson at the net, posting a .378 kill percentage and recording a match-low four errors, while Harvard tied its match-high in attacking blunders with five.
The Crimson’s superior .345 mark across the four sets—compared to Fort Wayne’s .258—was more indicative of its dominance up front, not to mention its 9-6 advantage in blocks. While hitting errors plagued the Mastodons’ match, Harvard’s net game was particularly clean, as the team’s 3.5 errors per game fell well short of the existing number on the season, 4.75.
“[This weekend] we focused on cleaning up our offense…” White said. “We were able to focus on hitting clean shots and getting first-ball kills.”
Three Crimson hitters finished with double-digit kill totals: White, junior Brad Gretsch, and freshman Erik Johnsson, with Gretsch’s 16 leading the way. As of Friday night, they account for 65% of Harvard’s offense this year.
These attacking efforts helped junior Marko Kostich tally 46 assists on Thursday night. Kostich and Fort Wayne sophomore Michael Keegan, who connected with freshman Pelegrin Vargas for a match-high 17 kills, finished level in dishes.
BALL STATE 3, HARVARD 2
The Crimson improved slightly on last season’s effort against the Cardinals, as this year it took the match into five sets. The two foes traded games until trading games was no longer an option, with Ball State ultimately avoiding a zealous Harvard comeback in the fifth game and eking out a victory.
The Cardinals jumped out to an early 3-1 lead in the final set and, after a period of sideout volleyball, were able to extend the margin to four late in the game. With the match seemingly in hand for Ball State, the Crimson rattled off three points to make things very interesting at 14-13. A quick conversion off serve receive snuffed the drama.
“Many times in the fifth game, it’s about who wants it more,” White said. “[Ball State] thought we were going to roll over once it was 14-10, but I was really proud of everyone for the fight they put up.”
Throughout the match, Harvard seemed to rally when it needed to most. Down 2-1 in sets and trying to will the contest to a fifth, the Crimson put down eight balls on 22 attempts without a single hitting slip-up.
Harvard availed itself of the Cardinals’ many service errors, particularly in games two and four in which Ball State recorded eight a piece. The opportunistic Crimson made the opposition pay for these preventable gaffes and nabbed both sets.
The Cardinals’ slew of service mistakes was somewhat predictable, however, on account of their aggressive service game. The visitors ripped seven aces and made siding out an arduous task for their opponents.
“[The Cardinals] were high risk, high reward from the service line,” noted White, a regular serve receiver. “When [the serve] was in, it was putting pressure on us, getting us off the net so we were out of system.”
Ball State’s domination in other areas of the game offset—and even outweighed—its statistical shortcomings from the baseline. The Cardinals won the kills battle 65-45 and thus tallied significantly more assists in the process. Their back row play was likewise commendable, as evidenced by their 48 digs and the Crimson’s struggle to put away points at times.
“I felt like we were hitting some good shots in between the block, over the block, and inside the block,” White said. “[The Cardinals] just seemed to be there every time, which is frustrating…. As the season progresses, we’re going to try to develop new shots…so we’re not so predictable.”
Harvard posted a .306 kill percentage in its back-to-back, a distinct improvement over last weekend’s mark of .164. As in the previous night’s match, White and Johnsson eclipsed the double-digit kills plateau on Friday, while freshman outside hitter Chase Howard assumed a larger role and pitched in a healthy 10 kills, including the first of his young career.
In addition to his 24 kills on the weekend, White played up 28 balls from the back row. His tenacious defensive play this season has him on pace for a career high in digs and a program record for digs in a single season. If White continues to perform at this pace defensively, he will graduate second on Harvard’s all-time career digs list.

Traveling across the country to Palo Alto, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team looked to sweep its demanding four-game road trip, which comprised of three top-5 teams in the country. The Crimson (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) continued its unbeaten play Thursday night against Stanford (3-2), winning all nine of their games and dropping just three sets. Harvard’s strong play nullified the Cardinal’s three-game winning streak, displaying a form typical of the nation’s top ranked program.
The Crimson had come off resounding victories against No. 2 Penn and No. 4 Princeton, adding confidence to its already stellar play. Despite trouncing  Penn by the widest margin in five years,  Harvard was not lured into a false sense of security.
“In terms of the match itself, we went into that match the same way we go into every other match that we’re playing this year,” captain Dileas MacGowan said. “Very much, sort of in it to win it, but very mentally prepared and serious about playing the Stanford team just as serious as we are when we go into playing number two and number three ranked teams.”
The Crimson’s top of the lineup cruised against Stanford with each of the top six refusing to drop even a set. Sophomore Sabrina Sobhy and freshman Gina Kennedy, two of the best players in collegiate squash, set the tone. Sobhy shut out opposing No. 1 freshman Casey Wong in her second set while Kennedy allowed just six points total in her three-game win. Led by their tenacious play, Harvard put the match away after just the fifth game.
Despite the strong start, the Crimson did not allow itself to let up against its foe from the West Coast. The two dropped sets by No. 7 Sophie Mehta and No. 9 MacGowan both went into tiebreakers. Other than those blemishes, Harvard came up with a thorough victory, up and down the lineup card.
“It was one of those matches that could have been a lot closer than what it was, but because of that mentality we had going into it we were able to come out with a solid and straightforward win,” said MacGowan.
But the value of a victory can never be understated.
“We try our best to not have it too close, but it’s not like we are expecting to win because easily, in squash, anything can happen so we definitely still get that thrill when we win,” senior Katherine Tutrone said.
For some of Harvard’s players, it’s sometimes good to make a sport like squash personal.  MacGowan follows this sentiment, and goes as far as to avoid knowing the results of other matchups before going on court so that she can focus on her own game.
“There are some instances that you do expect your team to win 9-0, but even if you are already up 5-0, at the end of the day it’s an individual sport so you’re self-motivated in a sense, as well,” said MacGowan. “Not just five wins here for my team, but this is my match and I’m out to win regardless of how the team is doing.”
Mental preparation was not all that aided the Crimson to victory. Even before they traveled across the country, Harvard had played for three straight days. The time before match day against Stanford increased in importance, but logistically they met that challenge.
“They have a pretty solid team. We were lucky to have the chance to go down there to actually train at the court for a couple days prior to the game. We were there from Monday to Friday, and the match was on Thursday—so we definitely had some good training.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kicking off the first matches of the spring season, the Harvard men’s tennis team claimed silver in the Crimson Kickoff and a victory against NJIT.
Furman, Old Dominion, and University of San Francisco all traveled to Cambridge on Saturday and Sunday afternoons to compete in the Crimson Kickoff at the Murr Center Tennis Courts. Following the competitions, the Crimson took on the New Jersey Institute of Technology in a separate duel.
“This is the beginning of of a wild journey and that for us is exciting and motivating,” junior Grant Solomon said. “We put in tons of work this J-term on campus, working on not only becoming better tennis players, but [also] seeing our tennis training as a path to becoming the best human beings we can be.”
CRIMSON KICKOFF
On Saturday, Harvard (2-1) started the the spring season and the Crimson Kickoff with a strong 6-1 victory against the Furman Paladins (0-2). Opening the season with some doubles play, the team dropped only one match in the three total doubles competitions.
Representing the Crimson in the number one position were senior Brian Yeung and junior Kenny Tao, who completed their match victory with a 6-2 win. The pair was the only doubles team featured in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association poll.
The number two seed was the other doubles team to win for Harvard. The captain Sebastian Beltrame and junior captain Jean Thirouin defeated their Furman competitors, 6-4. The pair of sophomores, Michael Peters and Andy Zhou lost 7-6 (7-5) against third-seeded opponents.
In singles competition, the Crimson mirrored its success in doubles by winning all but one match. It was only in the fifth seed that Harvard faced a loss, with Solomon falling in the third set 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
At the number two, three and four seeds, the Crimson faced close matches with every victory coming down to three sets. However, the number one and six seeded Beltrame and Zhou handled their opponents in two.
Facing Old Dominion (5-0) in the championship round of the Crimson Kickoff on Sunday, Harvard lost 4-0.
Captain doubles partners Beltrame and Thirouin won their matchup, their second of the weekend, against the number one seed from the Big Blue, 7-6 (7-5). The other groups of doubles partners fell, awarding their opponents the first point of the matchup.
“ODU was definitely the strongest of the three teams,” Tao said. “That being said, we had a lot of chances in doubles, and it really could have gone either way. We also had a few very close singles matches, and still while the score wasn’t exactly close, the matches were. The ODU team had a couple more matches under their belt this season, and I think we were missing some of that match experience. Furman and NJIT simply were weaker teams.”
In singles play, only Tao and Yeung had a shot at winning their matches with scores of 6-3, 6-5 and 7-6, 4-3, respectively. However, before they could claim their wins, the losses from the rest of the matches had piled up to an insurmountable 4-0 deficit.
Beltrame was again seeded number one and took on No. 24 Adam Moudir of Old Dominion. The Florida native lost 7-5, 6-3.

In the second matchup of the day, the Crimson took on NJIT (0-1), effectively handing the opponent its first loss of the season.
The doubles teams started off the matchup by sweeping their opponents. Seeded number one for the Crimson, Yeung and Tao led the competition with a strong 6-4 victory. In the number two slot, Peters and Zhou headed to a tie-breaker after a 6-6 game count. They would take the tie breaker 7-5. The number three seeded sophomore Christopher Morrow and freshman Logan Weber won in a decisive 6-2 match.
The singles were almost as dominant, dropping only a single match to the Highlanders. Harvard won all of the top three seeded competitions. The first came from Thirouin with 6-3, 6-1 victories. Solomon followed in suit with a dominating 6-0, 6-1 performance. In a closer competition, the third seeded freshman, Weber, won as well, 6-4, 7-5. Both Peters and sophomore Samuel Beren won their matches as well with a pair of 6-2 and 6-1 games, respectively.
“This weekend above all was inspiring. We gained great experience and competition with several great programs,” Solomon said. “Life is about expectation management, entitled to nothing, grateful for everything and that's where we are finding our inspiration and encouragement moving into next week's big matches. We just had an appetizer and are ready for the main course.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past two seasons, the Harvard men’s basketball team has been unable to beat Dartmouth twice. After coming out with a conference-opening win in the first matchup with Dartmouth each year, the Big Green has found a way to learn from its mistakes and defeat the Crimson.
Going into the locker room, it appeared that the trend had a chance to continue. Despite putting up an early 13-point lead thanks to hot shooting from behind the arc, Dartmouth (3-12, 0-2 Ivy League) ended the half up one as Miles Wright hit a buzzer-beating three to go up 35-34.
Though the Crimson bent, it would not break. After outscoring the visitors 48-33 in the second half, Harvard (10-5, 2-0) walked away with its second Ivy win of the season, 82-68.
STARTING WITH DEFENSE
For Tommy Amaker, defense has always been a priority in his time as a coach at Harvard. A former NABC Defensive Player of the Year at Duke, Amaker highlights defense as an aspect of the sport controlled by effort, something to lean on even when shots aren’t falling.
That mantra fit in early against Dartmouth as Harvard maintained just a 3-2 lead through the first media timeout of the contest. After sophomore guard Corey Johnson hit a three to break the ice just 38 seconds into the game, nearly five minutes would pass before the Crimson scored another bucket. The Big Green, however, was kept similarly quiet. While sophomore guard Guilien Smith hit a layup with 18:25 to go, Harvard’s defense kept the game close while the offense went quiet.
“I praised them for how well we started the game, and I know we weren’t able to sustain that, but I was really impressed and praised them for their start and their energy on defense,” Amaker said.
While the defense lapsed midway through the first frame to allow Dartmouth to recover from an early 13-point deficit, it just bent, but did not break. Most notably, the defense prevented Big Green star Evan Boudreaux from finding a rhythm and breaking the game open for Dartmouth. While Boudreaux had 15 points, approximately his per game average, he shot just 5-of-11 from the field and had only five rebounds, compared to his average of nine per game.
“It was really just a team effort,” senior forward Zena Edosomwan said of Boudreaux. “It’s just trying deny him early and not give him open threes because you know he’s an offensive option they’re always looking at. You try to stop him early or just make everything a lot harder for him.”
A NEW Z
Coming into the 2016-2017 season, expectations were high for Edosomwan. Coming off the best season of his collegiate career when he came just four rebounds shy of averaging a double-double, the senior has had a quieter-than-expected first half of the season. The Los Angeles native has started just six of 15 games and is averaging 6.6 points and 6.3 rebounds per game. On Saturday afternoon, however, Edosomwan showed how his role has evolved given the greater offensive efficiency of his teammates.
With the return of co-captain Siyani Chambers from injury and the addition of high-profile freshmen scorers such as Bryce Aiken and Seth Towns, Amaker has not looked to Edosomwan to be the high volume scorer of the past. Instead, he has taken on the role of rim protector, scoring from tip-ins and second chances as much as creating his own shot, and being tasked with creating a defensive presence on the other end of the floor.
The three-pointer was the highlight of Harvard’s offensive performance against Dartmouth, with the team sinking 13-of-24, just two makes shy of tying the team’s record under Amaker. Edosomwan, however, quietly amassed 15 points of his own off the bench. The senior was extremely efficient, making 7-of-8 from the floor. Off the glass, the senior had four of the team’s nine offensive rebounds. Defensively, Edosomwan was a presence in the lane, using his length to keep Boudreaux from getting comfortable and working his way to the rim, notching three blocks in the process.
In coming off the bench, Edosomwan provided a spark of energy on both ends of the floor as the starters tired from the quick pace of play early on. With such a large lineup compared to the typical college basketball team, Amaker has been able to be more selective in creating preferred matchups, which has led to significant variety of lineups.
“Our bench came in, with Bryce and Zena, and obviously Seth, giving us great minutes and great production, and then balance we get all over the floor from different guys makes it fun for our guys,” Amaker said.

Last semester was a special kind of hell. Don’t believe us? Repressed it from your memory? Let us recount for you:
Mankiw made buying the newest edition of his Ec10 textbook mandatory. (In response, Flyby made a list of things that your $132 could have gone to instead.) The men’s soccer and cross country teams were implicated in sexually explicit reports on their female counterparts. Mohamed Ali passed away. So did Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, and a score of other celebrities. Mumps returned to plague Harvard, though at least we managed to give it to Yale too. And, speaking of Yale, that community college up in New Haven beat Harvard in football for the first time in nine years.
The list could go on and on. The good news? We’ve likely hit rock bottom by this point, so there’s nowhere to go but up. To get everyone pumped up for second semester and to get over the pains of the last, Flyby has compiled a (non-exhaustive) list of things to look forward to this semester.
The Events 
Harvard Square Chocolate Festival (1/27-1/29) It’s soon, too.  The words “free” and “chocolate.” What more do we need to say?
Chinatown’s Year of the Rooster (2/12) Looking for an excuse to get off campus for a day? Hop on the Red Line, take it to Downtown Crossing, and head over to Boston’s Chinatown for a celebration of culture that is sure to be filled with food and fun.
Ariana Grande in Boston (3/2) By March, you might be tired of dancing side to side while the song “Side to Side” blares at yet another final club/frat/suite party. Why not get a ticket and go to TD Garden to dance in the presence of the “Queen of Pop” herself?
Housing Day (3/9) Arguably the ultimate can’t-miss event of the spring semester. Hello, 7 a.m. pregames and dressing up like your house mascot. Unless you’re one of those poor souls who has to take the SLS 20 midterm,  you will definitely remember the joy that is Housing Day.
Passenger in Boston (3/10) Sometimes you just need to let her go. And by her, we mean the woes of last semester. Passenger is coming to the House of Blues the Friday before spring break, so if you book your flight out of Harvard on Saturday, you really don’t have a reason not to go to what is sure to be a super chill concert.
Boston Marathon (4/17) Go cheer on your super fit friends (or volunteer at the event, if you’re feeling like community service). Or, if you are the super fit friend of your blocking group, go crush that marathon and check it off your Boston bucket list.
Yardfest (late April) Either the “CRJ for Yardfest” or the “Chainsmokers for Yardfest” camps will be extremely disappointed. We can’t really predict the outcome of this because the College Events Board is very good at secrecy.
Formal Season (read: reading period) It may be far off but formal season is one of the best times of the year. You get to dress up and ignore the fact that you have real schoolwork piling up on your desk! A word of advice from those of us who have tried and failed: never endeavor to go to Lamont right after a formal.
The Little Things 
Your friends
Admit it—we all went into finals season hibernation in the last days of the fall semester. Sure, maybe you were able to see your friend for a quick second between when she finished her last exam and hopped in an Uber home, but when was the last time you had an engaging, in-person conversation?
Snow (and cute Instas)
Think of how good a snowy Harvard Yard pic would look on your Instagram feed. #doitfortheinsta
Being done with summer applications
We’re writing this article when we really should be submitting the last of our summer applications. For those of you who went through the rush of consulting recruitment in early fall, this doesn’t quite apply to you, but for everyone else, godspeed. Just think about how relaxed you’ll be after you submit that final application.
For seniors: graduating. For everyone else: going home. 
Logically, what comes after the spring semester is SUMMER! And yes, this is very, very, very far off, but if you work hard this semester you can truly relax over summer break knowing you just finished a kickass term.
Stay strong, Harvard! Things are looking up.
