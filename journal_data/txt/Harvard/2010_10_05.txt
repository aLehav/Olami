After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the modern era of sports, being a college coach carries with it the burden of constant media attention. Facing dozens of reporters at press conferences, head coaches have gotten savvier—they say what they need to and leave the rest up for speculation. Here at The Back Page, we’re happy to decode some of these media sessions, showing the average fan what we think coaches’ answers “really” mean.
For Lafayette coach Frank Tavani, the 2010 season has been a nightmare the Leopards can’t seem to wake up from. After dropping three close games to Georgetown, Penn, and Princeton, Harvard came to town on Saturday and blew Lafayette out, romping to a 35-10 win. Now the Leopards, with the meat of their Patriot League schedule left to play, are winless against a slate they were 3-0 against last fall. It’s no wonder that Tavani expressed his frustration in this week’s edition of Sound Off.
What Tavani Said: Well, we certainly did enough things to shoot ourselves in the foot. Besides not playing well, then we’re doing those kinds of things…We’ve got to play darn near perfect, and we’re not only not doing that, we’re doing things that are making matters worse.
What Tavani Meant: Tavani’s referencing Lafayette’s 10 penalties for 109 yards in Saturday’s loss, including a pair of penalties totaling 30 yards on the same play and a roughing-the-kicker infraction that set up Harvard’s fifth touchdown. That was a big change from the discipline the Leopards have exhibited thus far—the team hadn’t accumulated more than 53 penalty yards in a game before Saturday. It’s not a coincidence that Lafayette’s biggest losing margin corresponded exactly with its sloppiest play.
What Tavani Said: The frustration just came out. There were a number of things going on down there that I was talking to the officials about, and to have a kid make a great play like that and to get that call …I just at that point had had enough, and rather than hold it in and have a stroke, I let it out.
What Tavani Meant: After yet another ill-timed penalty—this one an illegal block in the back—recalled a 94-yard touchdown run by freshman Jet Kollie, Tavani rushed the field to give the referees a piece of his mind. He also almost gave them a piece of his fist before he was restrained by two of his assistants and brought back to the sideline to calm down. It’s good to hear that Tavani is trying to avoid an Urban Meyer situation, and he certainly has every reason to be frustrated with his team, but the outburst was just the icing on the Leopards’ sloppy cake.
What Tavani Said: We’re fighting a lot of adversity...we had three starters on Thursday go down, and that shook up special teams and some other things. You know, you see an awful lot of freshmen out there, both on offense and defense, and particularly special teams. And even though it’s great for them to get that experience, they’re certainly not quite ready...
A couple of times we weren’t lined up, and the more young guys we’re putting out there, the more that happens. Hey, we don’t make any excuses. We got a good, old-fashioned butt kicking, and we’ve got to get up off the mat to play another day. And it doesn’t get any easier, because Columbia is absolutely blowing Princeton off the field right now.
What Tavani Meant: These two quotes would be excellent to use in a game of “Two Truths and a Lie.” The truths: Lafayette did get its butt kicked, and Columbia destroyed Princeton, 42-14. The lie: Tavani, in reality, did make excuses, citing the three injuries sustained in practice as a factor in the game and blaming the lack of game readiness of the freshmen he fielded. There’s no doubt that those absences did have an impact on the game plan, and there’s also no doubt that the Leopards will have their hands full with the Lions on Saturday. Judging by Lafayette’s performance, health, and attitude coming out of this contest, I’d bet on the Leopards falling to 0-5 in the Big Apple.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For David Sedaris, a world in which animals can speak and laugh is no fairyland of saccharine woodland friends. Instead of playing mildly about a brook, a well-meaning squirrel loses his romance to common prejudice, a mouse lures a brood of young toads away from their mother to feed her pet snake, and an overzealous guard-rabbit disfigures a benevolent unicorn to make a point against trespassing. Bambi and Thumper are nowhere to be found; in their place are self-serving brutes prone to flattery, deceit, and rampant hypocrisy.
In the self-proclaimed bestiary entitled “Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk”—something of a departure from his comfort zone in discursive autobiographical humor—Sedaris does away with the stock characters found in just-so stories and cautionary tales. Instead, he builds on our basic animal associations to craft psychologically complex personages who attempt to make sense of the unsympathetic world of feral beasts. Their stories constitute a darkly sophisticated collection of witty satirical fables, dramatized with gruesome scarlet and grey illustrations by Ian Falconer.
Each of these mock-fables, which bear distinctly Aesopian titles like “The Motherless Bear” and “The Migrating Warblers,” features a protagonist blinded by narrow-mindedness or—at the very least—burdened with an annoying quirk. Sedaris often exploits our natural tendency to project personality types on other species in deciding which weakness to ascribe to each animal. Thus, the toad uses aggressively revolting language; the faithful setter finds himself cuckolded by his wife; and the naïve young chipmunk finds herself wondering what “jazz” could possibly be—“What if jazz was squirrel slang for something terrible, like anal intercourse?” she wonders. Conversely, the author also flips our most obvious associations inside-out for an element of surprise, as when a parenting stork explains sex rather bluntly to her own offspring: “I said that you were not conceived of mutual orgasm and that it probably affected your ability to empathize, remember?”
The real humor behind these characters, however, derives less from our familiarity with animal stereotypes than it does from a kind of self-recognition. These feral protagonists are prey to uniquely human hypocrisies in distinctly human scenarios. In the same breath as he dreams up violent revenge against a demanding black snake bouncer—“I should have smeared an apple with shit, opened up her big fat mouth, and forced it down her throat”—the toad denounces a duck for his “racist” suggestion of a watermelon instead. Even while the betrayed setter nurses his pride after his wife bears the puppies of a bull terrier across the street, he relishes his commission to mate for his master’s purposes: “Some might define this as cheating,” he says of his four consecutive rounds with one setter, “but I just call it being thorough.”
Even as he condemns such hypocrisy, though, Sedaris rarely moralizes about it. On the contrary, he targets moralization itself as an object of mockery. One of his most repulsive protagonists is a narrow-minded brown hen who ascribes her sister’s untimely slaughter to her homosexual thoughts, and her friend’s death by predator to her vegetarianism. Similarly, in another fable a healthy lab rat blames her ailing companion’s artificially-injected diseases on his own negative outlook: “Some interpret it as overexuberance, but to me it’s a kind of vaccine—as long as I’m happy and I love everybody, I can’t get sick,” she babbles. Ironically enough, and perhaps not too appropriately, “The Judicious Brown Chicken” and “The Sick Rat and the Healthy Rat” are two of the few stories among the collection in which the hubristic protagonists meet an unambiguously deserved fate; here, the author is almost moralizing against moralization. Nonetheless, his point about patronizing ethical lessons is lucid enough: in these and in other stories, he expounds upon a vision of an unjust and unfeeling world that does not admit of arbitrary ethical structure. He describes the world of wildlife, and by implication our own, as one that does not deliver comeuppance to those who live in their own narrow-minded shells.
By framing such satirical condemnations as a bestiary, Sedaris also makes room for all the exaggerated drama of competition and death naturally occurring in animal life. In one parable, he mocks a miserly cow who chooses a turkey for a secret Santa simply because she knows he will be slaughtered before receiving her gift. In another, a willfully ignorant rabbit murders all those animals who dare question his defense of a useless gate attached to no wall; the fresh corpses of these creatures then attract further incredulous visitors to annoy the pedantic guard.
The gruesome facts of life in the wild quickly propel the plots of his short fables into comically ridiculous dramatic circumstances. To the author’s merit, though, this layered absurdity does not devolve into outlandish melodrama. Throughout his stories—whether narrated in the first- or third-person—Sedaris maintains the deadpan tone of a fairytale narrator who puts forth his fables as gospel. This straightforward style lets the characters’ illogical quirks speak for themselves, as Sedaris himself takes on the role of an objective observer.
Framed as they are by such direct language, his few forays into floral rhetoric become more powerful in their rarity. In dealing with such dark humor, Sedaris cannot escape a few moments of unadulterated hopelessness. In one such case, an ambitious owl threatens the life of a captured rat unless he provides his captor with some interesting fact. As he fails to think of something, the owl narrates, “his body relaxed beneath my talons, and I felt his hope leak onto the asphalt, as surely as if it were blood or urine.” Likewise, as the innocent chipmunk reflects back on her failed interspecies romance with a squirrel who liked jazz, she falls into a kind of wondering regret. “She forgot the definition of ‘jazz’...and came to think of it as every beautiful thing she had ever failed to appreciate: the taste of warm rain; the smell of a baby; the din of a swollen river, rushing past her tree and onward to infinity.”
Even once the exhilarating sting of Sedaris’ sharp humor wears off, these few bleak moments linger on as an aftertaste. The laughter he inspires turns out to be nothing but a spoonful of sugar, a quick pleasure to sweeten his dose of healthy chastisement.

Alex W. Palmer ’12 is like the quintessential Harvard student in that despite the casual demeanor, he is anything but typical. “I like to run, read, and hang out with friends. You know, the normal stuff,” he says nonchalantly. Yet in a not-so-normal but rather extraordinary vein, Palmer is displaying his very first solo humanitarian photography exhibit, entitled “Children of Kakuma,” in the Fisher Family Commons in the Center for Government and International Studies Knafel building through November 15.
Palmer says that the series of photos he chose to display showcases the artistic culmination of the six weeks he spent teaching and working with the children of the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya. With his Canon Rebel in hand, Palmer documented the daily lives of the young refugees, capturing the pride, strength, and hope of these residents amidst the bleak conditions of their domestic situation.
The Harvard Crimson: What brought you to Kenya?
Alex Palmer: I was looking for a different refugee camp where I could volunteer. I found one called Kakuma in Kenya, and they said that I would be able to teach kids and go into the camp and see what it was like. I went primarily for public service, to see what life was like for the refugees and to teach refugee kids, and then photography ended up being this new world, this great side interest that gave me something to do and gave me a great way to meet people.
 
THC: Was photography something you picked up on your own?
AP: I’ve had a few mentors who have used photography as a way to capture their international experiences. One of them was my [Quincy House] sophomore advisor, Seth Moulton [’01]. He had gone to Afghanistan the previous summer and displayed a small exhibit with his photos about children in Afghanistan. Another was someone I met [during] the summer of ’07. He was a veteran who had had a lot of international experience in college, going to places like Rwanda, the Balkans, [and] Bolivia to work with street kids, and he had used that combination of service and photography that I was looking to emulate.
THC: What is the message behind “Children of Kakuma”?
AP: People often comment about how in the photos, very few people look sad. The most amazing thing was that these people were living in such terrible conditions, yet were so incredibly proud to have someone take their photo. So many of the kids had never seen their own photo before because most people don’t have a camera. I really came to admire just the perseverance and the strength it takes to live like this, and I really wanted this exhibit to capture some of that.
THC: You mentioned that you took about 2000 photos. What were the reasons for choosing the 20 photos out of the other ones you had?
AP: I wanted to do something about children because I had spent most of my time teaching and working with these kids. Also, I think often when we talk about refugees, we don’t picture the effect on the children. A lot of these kids were born in the refugee camp, so it’s a very strange situation when the U.N. talks about sending these refugees home.
What is “home” for these kids who have grown up their entire lives in a refugee camp? Their families have been there for fifteen years, and if you really want to make a substantial change with the refugees, the kids is where you start. This was what I was interested in capturing.
THC: Do you see your photos fitting into this greater conversation of international relations and art?
AP: Definitely. One of the things I noticed from when I worked for the U.N. in Caracas, Venezuela the previous summer and from when I worked much more on the ground this summer is that people in both spheres tend to forget what life is like for the other. It’s very easy when you’re on the ground to say what decisions people should be making, and when you’re making the decisions, it’s easy to discount the experiences of the people on the ground. I wanted to bridge that gap and to give people a way to see what life is really like, and to not forget that when we talk about policy questions there are real people who are impacted, whose lives are changed.
THC: What have you gotten out of your experience in Kakuma?
AP: Because of my time in Kakuma, I decided to start a non-profit that would help pay for kids whose families cannot afford to send them to the local school where I was teaching. The last photo in the exhibit is just a short poster about my organization called, “Hope for Kakuma.” $185 would send a child to school for a year, including tuition, books, clothes and food. I know this is a fair amount to college students, but any amount would permanently change the life of these refugee kids.

Cracking symbols and codes, deciphering ancient texts, and uncovering millennia-old secrets are some of the mystifying feats for which fictitious archaeologists are often credited. While we can’t all be like Indiana Jones, the Peabody Museum is offering a chance for the public to participate in this world of exploration and discovery.
Sponsoring a yearlong lecture series entitled “Visible Language” that will be held in the Geological Lecture Hall, the Peabody will provide insights into the writing systems of once enigmatic cultures throughout time. Particularly this fall, the event will track the development of ancient writing systems through four upcoming lectures that range in topic from Chinese to Egyptian culture. Moreover, “Visible Language” will address the true origins of written language and introduce the progress made in each field.
Event co-coordinators Dr. Marc U. Zender, a lecturer in the anthropology department, and Pamela Gerardi, the Peabody’s director of External Relations, have been in the process of planning this program since last semester when the idea of using the concept of writing systems as the theme for a lecture series came up during a meeting.
“This is the first time the Peabody Museum is hosting a lecture series since I have been here. We have done seminars but not series, and depending on this year, we may do this more often,” Gerardi says.
The first segment of “Visible Language,” which was held on September 16, initiated the yearlong seminar with an introductory lecture by Zender.
The next installment, “Diviners and Scribes: The Origins and Development of Writing in China,” will take place October 6 with speaker Adam Smith, a humanities fellow at Columbia University.
According to Zender, the first event was successful in building a discussion with the audience, which was one of his primary goals in setting up the series.
With so many experts in the writing field at Harvard, Zender and Gerardi believe “Visible Language” will be a great way to synthesize the variety of material that exists. Moreover, it will present researchers with a unique opportunity to work cross-culturally within the visible language environment. Zender also added that these lectures would shine a light on the true origins and significance of visible language.
“Writing systems as human inventions deserve more popular attention,” Zender says. “It is a uniquely human phenomenon.”
The November 18 lecture, “Art as Writing: The Magic of Egyptian,” will focus on the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system. The speaker of the event, professor of Egyptology Peter Der Manuelian, will refer to artifacts like royal decrees, love poems, and trial records to demonstrate how the Egyptian hieroglyphic writing system functioned as both a functional and aesthetic tool.
“Even though the system has pictures, it is a language. There are nouns, grammar and a structure, “ Manuelian says. “The principle is to see how language and the writing system are emerged into the culture, but you can’t separate art from writing and writing from art.”
Moreover, he stresses that writing deserves particular attention since it truly is a human invention.
“Writing was invented in so many places and ways that it is a great testament to human ingenuity,” Manuelian says.
“Visible Language” will ultimately make understanding writing systems more accessible to the public.
To this end, each segment of the lecture series promises to expose audiences to groundbreaking research and evocative images from vastly different cultures as a means to dispel common misconceptions and express the importance of this now commonplace yet fascinating medium of communication.
“What is so ordinary to us was once so extraordinary,” Gerardi says.

The drawings of children are often populated with figures of family members, friends, and pets. For Jack, the five-year-old protagonist of “Room” by Emma Donoghue, this would be a difficult affair: the first five years of his life have been spent in a single room, and the only person he knows is his mother, whom he calls Ma. Instead of friends and family, his drawings might detail the other objects in his surroundings—he and his mother refer to “Room,” “Wardrobe,” and “Bed” as if they were other characters in the novel. Donoghue’s novel is not dissimilar to the simple drawings of a child, in which the lettering is plain, but the colors, values, and strokes of the crayon are detailed upon closer inspection. Told in Jack’s youthful voice, “Room” admittedly has a shaky beginning. But once Donoghue reaches her stride, her work emerges as a compelling story of human resilience.
Jack’s mother, Ma, finds herself caged in an 11-by-11 square shed for seven years after a ghastly kidnapping by a man they refer to as Old Nick. She gives birth to Jack during the second year of her imprisonment and is challenged to introduce him to the world using nothing but five books, a TV, her clever imagination, and good sense. The first chapter is mostly composed of an attempt to show the daily routines of mother and son. Jack is an obnoxious but innocent boy who has just turned five, and Ma is a worn, passive mother who adores her son and puts up with his whims. Although these scenes are undeniably crucial to the development of the book, they are too drawn out. Jack’s strange behavior, instead of being endearing, seems misplaced and awkward. Moreover, because at this point Donoghue has not yet given a reason as to why Jack and Ma are confined in the room, the detailed personification of their surroundings seems completely out of place.
As the book progresses, however, Donoghue’s writing style changes dramatically. She begins by writing in a choppy, scattered manner, making Jack seem somewhat absent in the head. He randomly spurts out declarations such as: “My two fingers zoom all around Room and nearly have a midair collision.” But immediately at the start of the second chapter, Jack becomes a more fully developed character. The book becomes more coherent as Donoghue explains the reason for their imprisonment and their immediate goal: escape. Now, Jack’s overly innocent character adds fuel to Ma’s increasing frustration and pushes her to realize their need to flee. Donoghue uses Ma’s inability to answer Jack’s questions to show just how small—figuratively and literally—the Room is. Ma’s relationship with Old Nick becomes increasingly puzzling to Jack as he begins to become aware of the maltreatment Ma endures. He acknwoledges, “Old Nick put those marks on her neck...actually that’s not dirt.”
Jack and Ma hatch plans to escape, and though the plans seem ludicrou sat first , Donoghue uses them as examples of Ma’s desperation. As the story unfolds, Ma changes from a two-dimensional character to a fully-fledged lost soul, who manages the strength to hold up her head as she tries to guide her son’s entrance into the real world. Jack’s unwillingness to participate in his mother’s whims shows just how much reality has been suspended for him.
Once they have emerged from “Room,” into what they refer to as “Outside,” Jack and Ma struggle to define themselves not only as separate entities from each other, but also as a parts of society. Jack is bombarded with a world that totally negates Ma’s best explanations. Society has as much trouble accepting him as he does accepting his new life. Ma, as happy as she is to be free, realizes that being back in the bigger world also means losing control of her own little world. “Room” begins with one room and ends with two. Donoghue impressively illustrates the changing relationship of the mother and son as they find their individuality and eventually reconnect with one another.
The strength of the book lies in Donoghue’s ability to critique reality through the thoughts of a five-year-old. Jack’s situation forms him into a perfect specimen of innocence. Jack observes, “I’ve been in the world three weeks and a half, and I still never know what’s going to hurt.” He recognizes, “I’m in the world all the time, I actually don’t know much, I’m always confused.” Donoghue uses the voice of Jack to create a commentary on the conventions of society, setting up his experience of the world as a contrast to that of humanity at large. Throughout the entire novel, Donoghue uses the changing relationships between Ma, Jack, and society to question the idea of innocence.  Jack’s innocence becomes shaded by society, while Ma emerges from Room regaining some of the innocence lost from isolation from society.

Incest, masturbation, constipation, and the letter “C” are the main subjects at hand in Tom McCarthy’s latest novel, “C.” The author of “Remainder,” McCarthy was effectively crowned modern literature’s new poster boy when Zadie Smith wrote in the New York Review of Books that his work was “one of the great English novels of the last ten years” in November of 2008. Sadly, “C” fails to live up to this reputation on several grounds, even though it makes a sincere effort to be a literary masterpiece.
All the significant elements in the novel begin with the letter “C.” The main character, whose last name is Carrefax, goes to Cairo, does cocaine, drinks champagne, all under the supervision of a Mr. Clair. This literary gimmick provides one of the unifying elements of the book. However, there is no clear explanation for its use. McCarthy’s constant word play and overuse of literary devices becomes tedious, overshadowing the plot and the development of his characters.
Although there are certain eye-catching episodes, the plot as a whole is overcrowded and convoluted. Serge Carrefax is born to a deaf mother and an eccentric father who runs a nontraditional school for deaf children. Serge and his older sister Sophie develop a dangerously close relationship as they find their interests—radio for Serge and natural science for Sophie, all before the backdrop of turn-of-the-century Britain. Following a catastrophe, Serge’s body develops a blockage which can apparently only be cured by the loss of his virginity combined with a dose of poison berry wine, in Germany no less. He goes off to war and becomes a pilot—a portion of the novel in which McCarthy shows off his significant knowledge about World War I. On one hand this demonstration of expertise shows the author’s dedication to research and historical accuracy, but on the other it makes the writing a bit clunky and too technical for readers unfamiliar with the subject matter.
There are passages which flow quite well—Serge’s views of the landscape from his aircraft while he is on cocaine or heroin—are almost poetic, and the descriptions of his highs are some of the most compelling portions of the novel: “The diacetylmorphine takes hold as he glides back up the path and over to his RE8, turning the machines’ manoeuvres as they taxi, pause and pirouette, escorting one another into position, into ballroom-dance steps, the roar of their engines into symphonies whose every chord is laden with insulation...” But many of the other episodes are too hectic to achieve this kind of eloquence. McCarthy’s work is full of turbulent, disordered passages which are missing the careful crafting necessary to achieve the kind of literary chaos he seems to be working towards.
The dichotomy between chaos and clarity is central to the work. Serge, with his drug use, seems to be looking for a heightened vision of the world. He reaches occasional moments of greater understanding; at one point, a taste of bootlegged wine gives him the clarity he desires: “Serge opens his eyes now, and finds that the gauzy crêpe that’s furred his vision for so long is gone—completely gone, like a burst bubble or disintegrate membrane.” Most of the time, however, the results of his substance abuse are perilous to his health, even ending in a plane crash at one point . His search to augment his vision nevertheless continues; even when he studies visual art, his greatest struggle is to accurately render perspective.
McCarthy has a parallel difficulty creating perspective in his writing, which lacks depth and continuity. Though the novel is full of recurring images and symbols, they do not create a deeper understanding of McCarthy’s central character. Serge’s story is presented not as a narrative, but as a series of brief vignettes from the life of a remarkable, though flat young man. Though Serge is both troubled and leads a fascinating life, his character is underdeveloped and unrelatable. McCarthy’s presentation of Serge’s thoughts and passions are occasionally distasteful, but even then not enough to inspire a strong reaction.
It seems to be in attempt to get such a reaction that McCarthy riddles “C” with scatological references, off-color words, and sex. As with the constant use of the letter “C,” McCarthy’s priority seems to be on the effect, rather than the substance, of his writing. Though Serge’s story has the potential to be compelling, it is ultimately overwhelmed by McCarthy’s overworked text. Gold star to him who enumerates all of the “c’s”.

"Funeral Mariachi" is the final album by enigmatic trio Sun City Girls, completed just before the death of percussionist Charles Gocher and the band’s subsequent dissolution in 2007. Collected here are the last transmissions from the outer reaches of their wilderness, a whispered epilogue for a testimony that was often so loud no one seemed to hear it at all. Spanning three decades and countless releases, the Sun City Girls’ project seems, now, less a musical enterprise than a sort of cipher, a drunken map of the American unconscious, born of a perverse iconoclasm, a militant sense of autonomy, and a quasi-religious pursuit of the unity of art and life. Wildly experimental, their music synthesized—through entropy, violence, parody, and a half-ironic sense of the divine—rich and often divergent Eastern and Western musical traditions alike: touchstones include raga, vaudeville, free jazz, folk, and psychedelic rock.
Mastered by the band’s surviving members—the brothers Alan and Richard Bishop—"Funeral Mariachi" isn’t an epitaph for Gocher. To the extent that it’s possible to discern credit on any of the band’s records, the late percussionist’s role in the group seems, here, already diminished. Gone are his savage, spoken-word monologues, his deadpan threats, the oaths—obscene and barely coherent on "Dante’s Disneyland Inferno" or "The Handsome Stranger"—of a man who seemed convinced that he was already dead. As if chastened by their partner’s growing absence, the Bishops have reigned in their aggression and their penchant for caustic improvisation, crafting instead a work foremostly of concision and startling, elegiac beauty.
Overtones of the Near and Far East—thematic referents to which the band’s work returns frequently—appear early on, in "Black Orchid," where incantations in a plausibly sub-continental dialect unfold against a spare arrangement including a ‘found’ sample of a young woman’s hypnotic siren-wail. "This Is My Name" continues much in the same way, with a hushed, spartan arrangement and lyrics that seem to profess a sinister interpretation of reincarnation: "When I was dead I looked just like you / Now I’m alive where nothing is true." Anomalously schizophrenic opener "Ben’s Radio" switches between possessed-jingle and acid-lounge groove, mimicking the crawl down a radio dial and calling to mind Alan’s field recordings for the Sublime Frequencies label in Africa and the South Pacific. "The Imam," the centerpiece of this progression—and of the album proper—brings Richard’s skills as a fingerpicker to the fore, opening with an eccentrically staccato guitar passage that gives way to a trance-like fugue of voices chanting what seems to be a prayer or mantra as it climbs towards ecstatic transcendence.
From here, "Funeral Mariachi" performs something of a structural about-face. The album’s spare second half plays more ominously, more loosely. Lyrics are as rare as they are cryptic—nearly half of the album’s 37 minutes are instrumental. The fulcrum is "Vine Street Piano," a dreamlike tape-recording of a melancholic piano sample, originally written for the soundtrack to "Mister Lonely," a film by Harmony Korine. The invocation seems appropriate. Korine bears a relationship to his industry analogous to that of the band: one of self-styled exile and opacity. Moreover, songs like "Blue West," "El Solo," and "Come Maddalena"—whose spaghetti western flare call to mind the more adventurous work of Ennio Morricone—sound of a piece with a soundtrack to a film that was never made.
However strange, the shift is a sophisticated one, made all the more so by the mysticism implicit in the album’s opening tracks. The symbolism of the lone gunman—the pilgrim, the seeker of profound truths (signifying Gocher, if one is sentimental enough)—is transfigured here. These are sleepwalking songs, marching—however beautifully—toward ragged and inauspicious ends. The title track revels in distinguishing itself among a group of songs that, paradoxically, seem cut from identical cloth. Either the traveler’s end is the same as his beginning, or the difference has ceased to be important.
It’s fitting that this album—what we can only imagine is the chronological terminus of Sun City Girls’ activity together, bootlegs and errata notwithstanding—should constitute such a haunting anti-catharsis. From a band that, time and again, rejected any notion of celebrity, that subverted conventions of taste and artistic integrity, that treated their audience as ambivalently as their perceived critics, this last act of denial manifests "Funeral Mariachi" as an end that never acknowledges itself. It is a record that continues after it stops playing, that continues to wander in search of a modest and silent place on the horizon of a world where resurrection is still possible.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, staff, and faculty from Harvard, as well as musicians from around the Boston area, convene every Thursday to sit shoeless on square blue cushions before large contraptions of wood and metal. In the Student Organization Center at Hilles (SOCH), they produce the hypnotic, cyclical, and resonant timbres of the gamelan. The presence of this gamelan at Harvard illustrates a general trend toward the academic study of world music in the music department.
The gamelan, pronounced GAH-meh-lahn, comprises metallophones, drums, gongs, xylophones, and occasionally vocals or other melodic wind instruments. This Indonesian orchestra reproduces the indigenous music of Bali and Java. Unlike a standard Western orchestra, however, each gamelan is unique—built as a specific, unified ensemble, with all instruments tuned in relation to one another. The music of the gamelan has several historical settings. For example, it was the royal court orchestra of Central Java, and provided music for Hindu temple festivals in Bali. In addition, the gamelan may accompany dance, drama, and shadow puppet theater.
Jody Diamond, Artist-in-Residence at the Harvard music department and founder of the American Gamelan Institute, has studied Indonesian music for the last 40 years. After first encountering the gamelan in the early 1970s at the California Institute of Art in Los Angeles, Diamond was struck by her new discovery. “I had no clue what these were,” she says. “It made me realize how much more there was to learn. It opened up a whole different world of music and musical ideas.”
Diamond traveled to Indonesia on a Fulbright Scholarship to survey contemporary Indonesian music, for which she interviewed composers. She later worked with prominent American composer Lou Harrison. In California, Harrison and his partner William Colvig built the gamelan currently housed at the SOCH. Upon his death in 2003, Harrison left the Gamelan Si Betty to Diamond, who began to look for its new home. According to Kay Kaufman Shelemay, several members of the music department were eager to have a gamelan at Harvard. Shelemay, then chair, is a professor of Music and African and African American Studies, as well as Director of Graduate Studies. Although there was a Balinese gamelan at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Javanese gamelan at Tufts University, the music department faculty was excited to obtain Harrison and Colvig’s uniquely American gamelan.
Diamond directs a community ensemble that rehearses weekly, which serves to enrich Harvard’s culture with the rich sounds and complex rhythms of Indonesian music. “In what way is a gamelan a vehicle for us to discover another culture? In what way is it a place for creating music?” Diamond reflects.
Courses and graduate studies in ethnomusicology—generally defined as both the study of non-Western musical traditions and the study of music as culture—are becoming increasingly popular at Harvard. Last year, the music department introduced a new course as an extension to its tutorial sequence, Music 97c: “Music History and Repertory: Music in Cross-Cultural Perspective.” Taught in its first two iterations by Shelemay, this semester’s curriculum comprises units on the music of Ethiopia, the Middle East, and the Balinese gamelan. As part of the course, students will have the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with traditions of world music, including gamelan performance labs with Diamond and a winter session trip to Washington, D.C. to study the music of Ethiopian Christmas. Other courses on Iranian, Asian, and global pop music reflect the increasing demand for emphasis placed on world music.
Graduate students in ethnomusicology are required to conduct fieldwork, and current students have traveled or will soon travel to areas as disparate as Taiwan, Turkey, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Czech Republic, Brazil, Israel, and Cape Verde. “Ethnomusicology is a field that has come into its own in the last 25 years,” Shelemay says. “It’s a growing, lively field—that’s nothing to sneeze at. Especially in America, we have so many musical traditions, and it’s important to reflect that in our curricula.”
“The music department is taking a turn in the right direction,” says Noam J. Hassenfeld ’12, a religion concentrator. According to Hassenfeld, in previous years the primary academic focuses of the music department were music theory and history. However, there are now more opportunities for composition and performance. Hassenfeld, Music Director of both The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers and the Pan-African Dance and Music Ensemble, was first exposed to world music in his Expos class: “Sound, Noise, Music.” The course introduced him to the gamelan. “It kind of blew my mind,” he says. This past summer, Hassenfeld received an Artist Development Fellowship to study gamelan music in Bali. Although he acknowledges and appreciates how it has been incorporated into an academic setting, he wishes that world music would assume greater relevance in the college community. “[World music] is not a side dish, it’s definitely a main course,” he says.
These sentiments are consistent with Diamond’s goals. She hopes eventually to form a new music group for more sophisticated performers and composers of the gamelan, awhile continuing to direct the current community-oriented ensemble at the SOCH. “It takes a while to grow a gamelan program. The trouble is getting people to not see these instruments as toys,” Diamond says. “I’m here to show Harvard everything the gamelan can be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diane Lane is one of the lucky actresses who was able to make the leap from child stardom to a successful Hollywood career.  But her love of acting is not the only childhood obsession to survive her adolescence. In her new movie “Secretariat,” Lane brings her youthful love of horses to the screen in the role of Penny Chennery, owner of the 1973 Triple Crown-winning horse, Secretariat.
“Secretariat” follows Penny, a housewife with no horseracing experience, and her trainer Lucien Laurin (John Malkovich) through their improbable race to the 1973 Triple Crown victory. Against all odds, Penny cleverly navigates the male-dominated racing world and comes out on top, proving that her horse Secretariat was one of the greatest horses of all time.
Lane herself was taken with horses from a young age, and refers to them as her “totem animal” during a time when she was a child actor working with professional adults. “I was already an adult hiding in this little 8-year-old body except for that dream of horses,” she says.
She also explains how she followed Secretariat’s races as a child, and remembers how his victory served as a symbol of hope in the otherwise pessimistic 1970s. “When Secretariat saved the day, everybody was talking about it, and everybody had smiles on their faces, and joy was around again,” she says. “I remember the cynicism just blowing away for a little while. And I mean that sincerely because I basically grew up around adults.”
Lane made her screen debut opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in George Roy Hill’s “A Little Romance” in 1979, at the age of 13. By that point, she had already been acting for many years in the theater, but the film shot her to the height of child stardom. She appeared on the cover of Time Magazine in August 1979 as one of Hollywood’s Whiz kids. But throughout her youthful career, Lane clung to horses as a powerful symbol of both her lost childhood and her career potential.
“I remember Secretariat,” she says. “It’s like Elvis, it’s just indelible in your mind. And it conjures up, for me, everything that I believed about horses, which is that they’re capable of greatness.”
Lane’s career continued through her adult life for which she has received much critical acclaim. Her performance in Adrian Lyne’s 2002 film, “Unfaithful,” even garnered Lane Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Actress.
Randall Wallace, the director of “Secretariat” is best known as the Academy Award winning writer of “Braveheart” and “Pearl Harbor.” He also won critical acclaim for “We Were Soldiers” and “The Man in the Iron Mask,” which he wrote, directed, and produced.
“My goal was to convey the eternal verities that courage matters, that hope prevails, that love works,” he said. “And that’s what I wanted this movie to say.”
Wallace, like Lane, also came into the project with a youthful fondness for horses. As a young man, Wallace had worked as a manager of animal shows, tending to barnyard animals at a theme park outside of his native Nashville.  This experience, along with his extensive training in the martial arts, helps him align Secretariat’s physical achievements with the historical events he depicted in his previous films.
“I don’t think there is a division when you get down to it between what is physical and spiritual, and mental, and the wisdom of all the martial arts will tell you that,” he says. Comparing Secretariat’s performance to famed opera star Paravotti’s, Wallace says, “Like Secretariat, there’s something that goes beyond what anyone thought was possible, and that, to me, is the transcendence.”

When filmmakers Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden met nearly eleven years ago, the film they began working on was hardly fortuitous.  They were film students at New York University and Columbia, respectively, and were working on a film together. This film was not “Sugar,” or “Half-Nelson,” or any other of the indie hits that would help them rapidly rise in the industry, but rather a student film that never even saw completion.
Fleck was assistant director and Boden was a production assistant. According to Fleck, he “got to tell people what to do” and he “wasn’t very good at it.” Apparently so, because one of his mistakes left her sitting on a truck in the rain.
Luckily, Boden forgave him. Eleven years and several collaborations later, they are promoting “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” their film adaptation of Ned Vizzini’s novel of the same name, a dramedy about a depressed teenager who checks himself into a mental institution. With notable actors like comedian Zach Galifianakis (“The Hangover”) and Keir Gilchrist (“United States of Tara”) it’s clear that Boden and Fleck have come a long way.
“It’s Kind of a Funny Story” is a departure for the pair, who normally write their own  material. “We didn’t know about the book,” says Boden. “We were given it by a producer and we loved it. I was laughing the whole way through it.  It had such a wonderful main character who was so just open and earnest and relatable and we saw it as an opportunity to do something different that we also really loved.”
The film is also arguably their most commercial project yet. However, their approach was still holistic; describing the meticulous process, Fleck says, “We write the script and we’re constantly rewriting the script, tweaking little lines here, cutting lines there, and then we rehearse with the actors and really work with them to find out what’s not coming out of their mouths very smoothly.  And then when you get all the actors together and rehearse it in front of the cameras, that’s when fun accidents happen.”
According to the filmmakers, the seasoned comedic cast, specifically Galifianakis, were responsible for the majority of these ‘accidents.’ Boden recounts how, “there were times when he had everyone cracking up so hard that you can actually see the camera shake in the handheld scenes because he’s got the camera operator laughing at his jokes.”
This is not to say that “It’s Kind of a Funny Story” is all superficial fun and games.  “Another great thing about Zach is that it’s not just the comedy, but he’s so spontaneous even in the more dramatic scenes. It brings a lot of life to those scenes,” says Boden.
The producer for their past three films, including “It’s Kind of a Funny Story,” Jeremy Kipp Walker, echoes their sentiments about the film’s multi-faceted tone. “It’s a teen comedy in a way but it’s the best version of that, much more like the John Hughes-style films we all grew up enjoying. Not your average kind of gross-out, sex comedy.  They put a lot of heart in it and pay real attention to characters and performances.”
Boden and Fleck’s unique style doesn’t end there. The pair is known for creating warm, familiar environments on set, however, they manage to do so while still keeping their personal lives from interfering with their professions; in fact, Fleck and Boden were romantically involved for several years. “Despite what’s happening on the personal side, as artists together they have a great collaboration,” says Walker.
When asked about Boden and Fleck’s future, Walker is hesitant to predict a particular path for the pair; whether they will return to the lower-budgeted, independent films that paved the way to this eight-million dollar comedy-drama, or if “It’s Kind of a Funny Story” is only the beginning of their more mainstream career together. “I think for them, whether they continue down the commercial road or they do more avant-garde work, I think that it’s always going to have that signature style of just integrity and authenticity,” says Walker.
The assistant director of their past three films, Mariela Comitini, is more vocal about Boden and Fleck, who she describes as two of her favorite directors. “They’re just only going to get bigger and bigger, but the quality and the spirit of their films will still remain the same,” she predicts.
“I think they’re going to blow up,” Comitini adds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last couple years have sometimes felt like one long goodbye to home. Turning to wave to friends and family as I pass through airport security to fly from Kentucky to Cambridge has become a marker of the passage of time, each goodbye—whether for an entire term or only the short weeks between Thanksgiving and Winter Breaks—a reminder that home is no longer the place I return to every night, the place from which absence is the exception rather than the rule. It is, I imagine, an experience shared by many students at Harvard, where so many come from other states or even other countries.
Maybe there is a meaningful sense in which Cambridge—or any other college town—can become a student’s home; I have noticed friends use “home” to mean their dorms, though I’ve yet to feel comfortable doing so. But that is not the kind of home I want to discuss, the kind of home to which one traces his origins, the home that can be as much a part of who a person is as his family or name. Whether you have that kind of home or not, the longing for a home like that—real or imagined—is a longing so frequently expressed in art that I am convinced the feelings wrapped up in that longing are universal.
Perhaps it is my own yearning for home that has drawn me to art rooted in these feelings. For my part, I associate that longing with a song I learned to sing in second grade, a song I’ve sung at school assemblies and basketball games for years since: Kentucky’s state anthem. “My Old Kentucky Home” is not so much a celebration of the state as a lament from the perspective of someone who has had to leave that state behind, who recalls with longing a more carefree past. “I will sing one song for my old Kentucky home,” reads the chorus, “for my old Kentucky home far away.”
The official bluegrass song of Kentucky, the Bluegrass State, tells a similar story. “Blue Moon of Kentucky,” written by Bill Monroe—and made even more famous through covers by, to name a few, Elvis, Paul McCartney, and Ray Charles—tells the story of a lost love. “It was on a moonlight night, the stars were shining bright,” sings the lover, “when they whispered from on high, your love has said goodbye / Blue moon of Kentucky keep on shining.” These are songs I can identify with, songs that couch love for home in a feeling of loss. For me the two feelings have become nearly identical.
But why does it feel right to respond to bereavement by singing about that sorrow, to answer homelessness by singing about a home far away? Can singing about my lost home help me find it again? Maybe in lamenting its loss we summon those feelings proper to home, mixing memory with desire, and summon something of home into our hearts. Maybe a song about home can be as if a magic spell, a melodic conjuring of a home which, whether we ever really return or not, lingers for a time—returning home, in a sense, to us.
If these last couple years have been a long goodbye, they have also been spent learning how to return to a home with which my relationship, if not my affection, has changed. This is the longing Kentucky’s two anthems awakens in me, the longing to return to a home that, though not exactly the same, is still lit by that same blue moon. Maybe it is the same promise with which T.S. Eliot ends his Four Quartets in a secluded chapel in England, the promise of an end that is the return to the beginning, a final homecoming: “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.”
This Thanksgiving Break I will return to Versailles, Kentucky again, back to the town in which I’ve spent most of my life but only a few months of the past year. It will, I have little doubt, be much the same: the same main street with the same brick-front shops and restaurants, the same sprawling horse farms and winding back roads. But I will not be the same, and I will see home with new eyes, as if for the first time, perhaps catching the first soft notes of some new melody in the whispering leaves as they fall under the light of a blue Kentucky moon.

Vampires—they’re just like us. Almost any stereotype you can imagine as a human is now available in vampire form. They are still bloodthirsty of course, but the past few years have seen vampires who are less evil and more eminently human: caring, insecure, needy, and sometimes just selfish. Regardless of type, vampires generally seem to inhabit those places where baser feelings triumph, and so the school playground seems a natural place for them to make their next appearance.
The schoolyard in question in “Let Me In,” directed by Matt Reeves and based on the 2008 Swedish film “Let the Right One In,” is the site of torment for skinny and sensitive Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the victim of bullies who call him “little girl” and give him wedgies. His home life isn’t much better, but it is in front of his apartment that he meets a new neighbor named Abby (Chloe Moretz) who encourages Owen’s dreams of revenge, and turns out to be bloodthirsty in her own right.
Ultimately, there is no single aspect of “Let Me In,” that goes horribly wrong. The film is too faithful to the original to steer far off course. Rather, it seems like a cartoon version of something real, adding an extra helping of blood and pretty Hollywood actresses to what might be the quietest vampire movie ever made.
“Let Me In,” tries hard to make its American viewers feel at home. It does so in the same way one might imagine future generations would decorate an American-themed amusement park. Ronald Reagan is on TV, and Owen really likes Now and Laters. Occasionally, Owen turns on some music from the 1980s, interrupting the gloomy horror-movie soundtrack because—despite the fact that most of the film takes place in an anonymous apartment complex in an unnamed city where it is always snowing—the director wants the viewer to know that this is an American movie.
However, lest viewers confuse the two movies in their mind and mistakenly think that one is merely a dubbed version of the other, it is important to point out some crucial differences. First, and most importantly, fewer people in “Let Me In” are blond, including the protagonist. Second, some of the lines have been changed in translation, though most of these lines correspond to the addition of Now and Laters to the plotline.
Owen’s sweettooth is symptomatic of a general cleaning-up of some of the more disturbing aspects of the original. There is more blood and violent vampire gorging in “Let Me In,” but blood and gore has never bothered Americans. What was really scary about the original was that the film hinted that the little girl may not be a girl at all, whereas in “Let Me In,” she may not be human, but she is more explicitly female.
“Let Me In” is much more concerned with notions of morality than gender ambiguity. When a police officer gets a hold of Abby’s accomplice/father figure (Richard Jenkins,) he is not interested in his or Abby’s gender. Rather, one of his first questions is, “Are you a Satanist?” The religion theme is heavily emphasized through Owen’s mother (Cara Buono) who is deeply concerned with keeping evil away, and litters the house with religious icons.
In shifting the focus of the movie away from the ambiguity present in a relationship between two children—neither of whom truly know what to become or what they are capable of—and towards a larger societal comment on good an evil, “Let Me In” loses some of the quiet magic that infiltrated the original.
The remake is not without its beautiful moments, however, many of which are faithfully transposed from the original. Reeves is skillful at creating sympathy for those who live off blood without ever making them seem fully human. A scene in which Abby’s accomplice is hastily trying to drain the blood from a victim, when the arrival of cops disrupts him, manages to highlight his own pathetic helplessness. It is in moments like these in which the “villains” start to seem a little more like us.
Moments like these—not the brown hair or American actors or the Ms. Pac-Man references—will make American audiences feel a jolt of recognition while watching “Let Me In.” It is the feeling of being small and alone without understanding who you are, let alone who anyone else around you is, that makes the vampires in this movie remind us so much of ourselves.

Mary Stuart
October 8 - 16, 7:00 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by James B. Danner ’12
Produced by Michael D. Cherella ’11
Given the state of today’s docile British monarchy, it seems unlikely that a queen would kill her own cousin out of fear, suspicion, or greed. Yet, in Friedrich Schiller’s “Mary Stuart,” these issues directly motivate Elizabeth I’s struggle to decide the fate of her estranged relative Mary, Queen of Scots.
The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Mary Stuart” will transform the Loeb Experimental Theater into a space where characters can aspire for freedom, political power, and perhaps even redemption.
Elizabeth has reason enough to fear her fellow monarch, as Mary has already murdered her husband before seeking asylum in Elizabethan England.
When the production begins, Mary is already Elizabeth I’s prisoner and fully aware that her cousin will likely sentence her to death.
“We all know that she is going to die, and yet it is so desperately moving,” director James B. Danner ’12 says.
The unusual prominence of female characters struck Danner when he first chose to direct the play. “It’s great to be able to do a show that has female characters that are characters before they are women,” he says. “They’re not terribly feminine but that’s part of why I loved it.”
Additionally, the play’s departure from history renders its characters more sympathetic and, thus, more relatable. “It’s about real people: revenge, insecurities, characters who are flawed,” says Jacqueline J. Rossi ’12, who plays Elizabeth I.
While the characters may seem relatable in their flaws and insecurities, neither Mary nor Elizabeth is a typical heroine with whom to identify. “Neither one of them is totally innocent,” Rossi says.
Rebecca E. Feinberg ’13, who plays Mary, says of her character, “She knows ultimately that she will never be forgiven for the sins she’s committed.”
In this setting of revenge, murder, and greed, the hope of redemption and moral fortitude nevertheless persist. Danner expects that these themes will readily translate to the stage in this production.He says, “They come together in a wonderfully human way.”

It is San Francisco, 1955. A dishevelled Allen Ginsberg (James Franco), stands before a smoke-filled bar. He lingers amidst the gentle clatter of wine-glasses and jazz before beginning the introductory lines of his most famous poem: “I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness.” A few minutes into Ginsberg’s reading, which is shot entirely in black and white, “angel-headed hipsters” appear on screen as a series of animated, distorted, naked figures gliding through city blocks made of books. They then fly through a grimly-colored city above fields of skulls and disfigured corpses.
After watching such scenes, one may find it difficult to define the genre of Rob Epstein and Jeffery Friedman’s “Howl.” Encapsulating the rise of the 1950s “Beat” counter culture, the film entwines a number of threads, including aesthetically-astounding animations that graphically narrate the readings; recreations of the hedonistic fervor of the Beat Generation and events of Ginsberg’s own tumultuous life; and a dramatically-imagined depiction of the  titular poem’s obscenity trial in 1957. This consortium unleashes an astounding impression—fantastic and bizarre—yet the film is painfully reduced in the final few minutes to a cliched reassertment of the value of free speech.
The film’s overall structure is certainly unique. Epstein and Friedman depict not only events of Ginsberg’s life, but also graphically narrate the work. Throughout the film, colorful yet grotesque animations erupt across the screen, mirroring the controversial work’s explosive societal impact. Moving between animation, the first reading of “Howl,” the obscenity trial, and interviews with an older Ginsberg, the film does not follow a temporal linear progression. Rather it uses the reading of “Howl” to tell Ginsberg’s story. The contents of the work are employed as a framework for the narration of events in Ginsberg’s past and for the correlating stage of the trial. Thus the film successfully tells not only Ginsberg’s story, but also charts the influence of his work.
Every scene is directed and shot with a sympathetic subtlety and understanding of Ginsberg and his work. Moreover, Epstein and Friedman diligently adhere to historical events and interviews, which lends the film an invaluable sense of authenticity. Scenes in which Ginsberg narrates his own life are themselves the faithful re-creation of footage of the actual poet. Silent shots of Ginsberg lying in blissful contemplation on concrete steps are reproductions of famous photographs. Franco’s lazy, tonal voice and passionate portrayal of the  San Francisco reading also genuinely capture Ginsberg’s disillusionment with the world and resilient optimism in the face of generational despair.
Scenes of the trial may constitute the thread which lets down this otherwise beautifully-crafted movie. The trial comically portrays the prosecution lawyer as a sexually-repressed victim of an uptight society incapable of recognizing the deep self-reflection and mourning in the work. Indeed one ‘renowned’ English Professor is unable to recall the name of the protagonist of “Howl,” despite his insistence that the text may trigger the psychological collapse of vulnerable members of the community because it references “balls.”
However in the closing scenes of the movie, the sequence becomes an overly dramatized vindication of free speech. The defence lawyer’s final words—although they would be empowering at the conclusion of an inspirational sports movie—twist the final moments into a magnanimous declaration of ‘What It is To Be American.’ At the conclusion of a film that has championed subtlety of gesture and imaginative creativity, this moralizing is somewhat disappointing.
But the film’s overall sense of disorientation nevertheless effectively un-moors the viewer from any preconceptions concerning the conventions to which all biographical films must adhere. In so doing, “Howl” offers three very different perspectives of Ginsberg: his hectic past, his older self after the poem has been written, and, symbolized in the mind-blowing animation, the imaginative consciousness that lurked behind his tortoise-rimmed glasses. Epstein and Friedman have not only successfully produced a sympathetic biography of Ginsberg, but have also blazed a work of comparable creative skill upon the screen.

What I love about film is its sheer boundlessness. Film is a medium in which any other art form can also be present, including paintings, fashion, poetry, and of course film itself. A director can endow the screen with endless depth by consciously displacing viewers from one reality he shows to another he recalls through visual references, weaving all forms together in a self-reflexive manner. The most recent film that fully exploits the potential of meta-cinema is Pedro Almodóvar’s dense and dramatic “Abrazos rotos” (“Broken Embraces”) which came out last year, and which the Center for European Studies recently screened. It is a film about the process of making and remaking a film. Four different films are made inside one, and every single character is also a spectator of one of the four. “Abrazos rotos” is remarkable in how it has taken meta-cinema to a new level, in which there are several films, movie screens, and directors in dialogue and sometimes opposition with one another, each perspective enriching the other and creating a nuanced and unusual kind of film.
In “Abrazos rotos” Almodóvar traces the experience of director and auteur Mateo while he makes and then attempts to remake a film. The film Mateo makes, called “Chicas y maletas” (“Girls and Suitcases”), is actually one of Almodóvar’s previous films which he decides to resurrect, the tragicomedy “Mujeres al borde de un ataque de nervios” (“Women On the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,” 1988). Another amateur director and character of “Abrazos rotos,” Ernesto Junior, makes a documentary about the process of making the film within a film. Once he is done with the documentary, he has a whole new film in mind that he feels an urge to create with Mateo. In this amalgamation of current, previous and potential films, each film has a very personal motivation—love, jealousy or the search for one’s identity. Despite the numerous and potentially confusing layers, “Abrazos rotos” remains emotionally raw and perfectly coherent.
Not only does Almodóvar show “Chicas y maletas,” a past film he has made, he also makes new films through the eyes of his very own characters. I think that making a film, parts of which are literally filmed by other characters is an act of humbleness. As the perspective in “Abrazos rotos” jumps to the camera of another director—sometimes Mateo Blanco, sometimes Ernesto Junior—Almodóvar is, in a way, sharing or even precluding his authority, as he becomes just one auteur among many. Perhaps the most elaborate acknowledgement of the personality of another character that a film director can make is to put him on the same plane with oneself, and display within his film that character’s original film work, thus appearing to surrender his own space to different eyes.
As the images of “Abrazos rotos” are displaced by the cameras of various fictitious directors, the images also recall the work of actual ones, such as Federico Fellini and Luis Buñuel. For example, Almodóvar films a rotating cosmic structure that may remind viewers of the spaceship in Fellini’s masterpiece “8½,” shows the “8½” DVD box, and a book of the screenwriter who has co-authored many of Fellini’s films, Tonino Guerra.
In the summer of 2009, many months before I saw “Abrazos rotos,” I was in Italy translating the poetry of Tonino Guerra. As I was sitting in the living room of Guerra’s house in Santarcangelo, while drinking tea, he mentioned, “You wouldn’t believe it, some Spanish director is making a film, and wants a character to pack the Spanish translation of my book with him in a suitcase, because he says the character absolutely cannot leave and go anywhere without it. He called me up and asked me for permission this morning.” In reality, it is not that the character, Judit, couldn’t leave without his book, it is that Almodóvar’s film would have probably never existed without a certain film history which preceded it, and Guerra’s screenplays are an enormous part of that history. As Judit travelled across space with the book, Almodóvar travelled in time, keeping the classics in mind. With references like this one, “Abrazos rotos” becomes a celebration, not only of making one movie, but of cinema and creation in general, both past and present.
I admire a master who can craft a movie somewhere in the space between several cameras, several movie screens and many pieces of art, and yet make room not only for an intriguing storyline, but also homage to the films that were written and directed before him. In this work, every character is a spectator of the image, consuming the others’ images, and reality is mediated by so many lenses that it regresses into an infinity as if in a kind of matryoshka—one which holds dolls that are mesmerizing, from all different countries and time periods. In “Abrazos rotos,” which Almodóvar calls a love-letter to cinema, he shows us that before the auteur can be a creator who films something for the sight of others, he must himself be both a viewer and a visionary, one who sees and creatively understands the actual world and the world of film—and then blurs any border between the two.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This past Saturday, the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) commenced its 130th season with an all-Wagner program of symphonic overtures and operatic selections. The orchestra delivered a polished and spirited performance, but it was Welsh bass-baritone Bryn Terfel’s masterful singing that carried the night.
A packed hall of symphony benefactors and concert enthusiasts welcomed Maestro James Levine back to Symphony Hall with a standing ovation. Levine’s recurrent health issues had forced him to withdraw from the majority of the BSO’s performances last spring. The orchestra opened the program with a stately execution of the Prelude to Act I of German composer Richard Wagner’s “The Mastersingers of Nuremberg,” a three-act comedy-opera about a young knight’s quest to win the hand of the mastersinger’s daughter.
The ensemble handled the Prelude’s opening march theme with a sense of rhythmic pomp and circumstance befitting the gala occasion. Woodwind runs embellished lush high string passages, which then gave way to brass-heavy sections that hinted at recurring themes. Levine guided the orchestra in sustaining a Mozartian balance throughout the piece, never overplaying Wagner’s clean melodic lines. Levine then welcomed Bryn Terfel to the stage for the first of the three solos that the international opera star would sing that night. While a heavy-handed high strings section occasionally drowned out the soloist in his brief monologue in “The Mastersingers of Nuremberg,” Terfel’s voice nevertheless took center stage.
Terfel’s tone harbored a thoughtful focus that held steady throughout a slew of dynamic contrasts and tempo changes. His phrasing was equally grounded, creating incredibly smooth melodic lines that were broken only by the singer’s sharply syllabic articulations of the German libretto. Unlike many opera singers, Terfel kept his body almost completely still throughout the piece, allowing the nuance of his voice alone to guide the audience’s musical experience.
Levine then led the ensemble in a rendition of Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” from the opera “Die Walkure,” often recognized as the theme that accompanied the classic helicopter landing scene in Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now.” Levine chose a tempo that was much more conservative than what might befit a movie soundtrack, but the relatively slow rendition still embodied a remarkable sense of vigor and excitement. Almost every section of the orchestra referenced the main theme throughout the piece, which culminated in a show-stopping coda that showcased the symphony’s dynamic capabilities in full force.
Terfel followed with the solo “Wotan’s Farewell” from the same opera. Terfel’s interpretation ran the full gamut of vocal expression: his voice soared with passion one minute only to taper in disappointment the next.
The third and final overture-operatic solo pairing of the program consisted of selections from the operatic staple “The Flying Dutchman.” The orchestra’s interpretation of the opening overture was particularly confident and spirited: Levine clearly has a flair for musical color that suited the overture perfectly.
Terfel closed the program with the “Dutchman’s Monologue”—a piece that, true to its roots in the Italian “recitative” style of vocal delivery, resembled speech more than it did song. Terfel’s pensive but hardly melodramatic rendition was again captivating—his moderate use of vibrato achieved a melodic line that was colorful but not too flighty. The relatively anti-climactic monologue, however, did seem a peculiar choice for ending the concert.
While the music showcased at opening night may have erred a bit on the monochromatic side, the programming—rather than the BSO’s performance caliber—was to blame. Levine has returned to near-top musical form, and the orchestra’s trademark musical cohesion remains intact. The rest of the season boasts more programmatic diversity, giving the orchestra much room to deliver.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From majors in hip-hop studies to classes on crime novels, a new wave of academia has trended recently toward grabbing non-traditional subjects and planting them under the revelatory light of scholarship.
Such was the case in the Humanities Center at Harvard’s (HCH) first undergraduate event of the year, a discussion called “Teenage Wastelands” led by Professor Linda Schlossberg in the Barker Center last Wednesday. Schlossberg and the event’s attendees discussed the increasingly frequent portrayals of dystopian societies in young adult novels, examining topics such as conformity, gender roles in adolescence, and the dystopia as a metaphor for growing up.
The informal dialogue focused particularly on two recent hits: Scott Westerfield’s “Uglies” series and Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” trilogy.
“People often characterize teens as being shallow and conformist—as being interested only in popularity, looks, and fashion—but the success of these works show that teens are interested in fiction that critiques the dominant culture,” Schlossberg said.
She began the discussion by outlining the psychological power of the dystopian setting, then tying it to the fears of and constraints upon modern day teenagers.
“The best dystopias take our current cultural anxieties and magnify them, shine a light on them, and help illuminate for us things that are problems in our culture,” Schlossberg said. “If they do this well, they take some of our concerns and tweak them a little.”
Schlossberg then opened up the discussion to the 12 participants. They explored older dystopian pieces and depictions of the teen years, contrasted these works with utopias and real-life circumstances, and connected the topic to everything from “Catcher in the Rye” to “Buffy the Vampire Slayer.”
“Part of it [the event’s appeal] is the excitement of getting to talk about something that people care a lot about and do in their free time, but with a professor,” said Undergraduate Committee member Spencer B.L. Lenfield ’12, a Crimson arts contributor, who helped organize the event. “She uses the perspective she has as an academic to think about the same kind of fiction that a lot of undergraduates read for fun.”
“One of the things I appreciated about this event is it took this very particular subgenre which many would consider totally without merit, and then used that to examine greater issues,” attendee Samantha A. Meier ’12 said. “I think that’s something that is really worthwhile.”
As a professor in the women, gender, and sexuality department—popular around campus for her class Culture and Belief 37: “The Romance: From Jane Austen to Chick Lit”— Schlossberg also tied these books to issues of gender identity in discussing their unusually strong female protagonists.
“It doesn’t really fit into our gendered expectations that the protagonists in these books, which are all about rebel forces fighting against the system in physical and sometimes very violent ways, would be female,” Schlossberg said.
Rather than opting to lecture on a subject well-worn in academia, Schlossberg said she chose this topic for its novelty. She’d become interested in the books only recently, talking about them with friends, and had found their appeal and subject matter unique.
“There’s an interesting crossover appeal that is not unlike the appeal of the ‘Twilight’ series and the ‘Harry Potter’ books, which I find intriguing,” Schlossberg said. “I thought I would take advantage of the informal structure and find out what students thought about this issue, rather than just listen to myself speak about something I teach on a regular basis.”
As the first undergraduate event of the year, the discussion also encapsulated the Humanities Center Undergraduate Committee’s mission for the year—facilitating cross-discipline thought and conversation in the humanities for undergraduates, echoing the resources available to graduate students and professors.
According to Lenfield, other undergraduate events will follow throughout the year, including both professor-led discussions and larger-scale presentations by non-faculty members on a variety of humanities topics.
“Our goal is to encourage similar discussions across concentrations for undergraduates and expose undergraduates to the sort of ideas that people often engage with at the level of professional academics, but that undergraduates might not come in contact with,” Lenfield said.
In students’ opinions, events like these all come back to the simple pleasure of exploring subjects they genuinely enjoy.
“It’s so much fun in the middle of a crazy day to just sit around and talk about books with people who are just as excited as you are, and that’s definitely what the event was,” attendee Lila G. Brown ’11 said. “There was no pretension, no scholarly words flying around—it was just a great conversation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With five regattas and an invitational in only four days, the Harvard sailing team certainly had its hands busy this past week. Despite failing to capture a first-place team finish for the first time in four weeks, the Crimson had impressive showings both in the Boston area and in Connecticut en route to capturing four top-10 finishes.
“This weekend was the beginning of the more competitive regattas,” explained junior crew Quincy Bock. “I think now, we’re getting back into the swing of things.”
The handful of tournaments provided plenty of practice, and the upcoming four weeks will give the squad ample time to train for the ACC Qualifiers.
HARVARD INVITATIONAL TWO
At Sunday’s Harvard Invitational Two, the Crimson finished fourth of nine teams with 54 points behind Brown, Tufts, and Bowdoin. In the A Division, sophomores Nick Waldo and Jinyan Zang took fourth, one point behind the third-place Polar Bears. In the seven-race set on the Charles, Waldo and Zang captured three second-place finishes.
RICHARD B. ROSS COLLEGE BOWL
A barge transiting across the Courageous Sailing Center’s course mid-race made for a rather interesting turn of events this past Saturday, but the Boston-based Ross Trophy regatta was still a success. Initially planned as a six-race event, the barge’s crossing reduced that number to five. In the A Division, Harvard nabbed sixth place out of 16 thanks to the efforts of senior Colin Santangelo and sophomore Samuel Millham.
MYSTIC LAKE INVITATIONAL, CENTRAL SERIES FOUR
Home turf proved to be an enormous advantage for the Jumbos this weekend at the Mystic Lake Invitational–the Tufts 2, 1, and 3 boats captured the top-three finishes, respectively. The Crimson sent freshmen Ben Lamont and Margaret Fulham in the A division and classmates Ames Lyman and Alice Kenney in the B division, and the rookies held their own in a seventh-place finish. The first-year sailors edged out Amherst and Northeastern by more than 100 points.
SMITH TROPHY
Sailing against 25 other teams last weekend at the MIT-hosted regatta, Harvard ended the 12-race set in 16th place overall with 346 points. Top-three teams Yale, Roger Williams, and Dartmouth dominated the competition with point totals of 154, 160, and 162, respectively.
In a standout performance, sophomore skipper Ryan Byrne sailed with freshmen crews Isabel Ruane and Sarah Pierson to claim fifth place in the A division with 131 points. The race was far from easy, though.
“We sailed in a boat that we don’t usually sail in so we weren’t really used to it,” Byrne said.
Despite the lack of familiarity with the tech boats used, Byrne and his crews managed very well–in four of 12 races the athletes nabbed top-five finishes.
Ruane also sailed in the B division with classmate Caitlin Watson and junior Julia VanderVink. The end result proved not as promising, however, as the group accrued 215 points for 19th place.
DANMARK TROPHY
The Crimson’s Connecticut-bound contingent garnered 272 points on the weekend to secure seventh place at the Danmark regatta.
“It started off really well and kind of went downhill from there,” Bock said. “On Saturday the team was winning by I think 25 or 30 points, but we lost our lead on Sunday.”
But despite the lost lead, Harvard still had an edge on over half of its competition.
At the 20-team intersectional, senior John Stokes, junior Marie Appel, and senior Meghan Wareham took second place in the B division, no doubt the result of seven top-three finishes.
Over in the A division, senior Alan Palmer and senior captain Tedd Himler swapped skipper duties and sailed with a trio of crews in the 16-race set. Together with sophomore Alma Lafler, Palmer nabbed two first-place finishes; Bock and Wareham chipped in solid efforts as well to lift the squad to a 10th-place finish.
“On Sunday we struggled a bit more, but it provided us with a lot of good practice for our more competitive regattas coming up,” Bock said.
MIDWEEK TECH INVITATIONAL NUMBER THREE
Down the river at MIT on Sept. 30th, 20 boats sailed through high winds at the third Midweek Tech regatta. Northeastern dominated and took the top-two slots easily, but the Crimson’s Byrne and Pierson raced to a solid third-place finish with 35 points. Other Harvard boats also finished in the top fifteen.

After its disappointing loss at Brown the week before, the Harvard football team’s offense was salivating at the chance for redemption on Saturday afternoon at Lafayette. With the untested arm of sophomore Colton Chapple on the field in place of injured senior starting quarterback Andrew Hatch, the spark for the Crimson would have to be found in the hands, and legs, of its running game. Senior running back Gino Gordon took the opportunity—and the ball—into his own hands and ran with it, leading Harvard to a 35-10 victory.
“Gino’s always been elite on this team,” said sophomore and fellow running back Treavor Scales. “He always plays his game and gives it his all every time he steps on that field.”
A first-team All-Ivy selection a year ago, Gordon spearheaded a dominant Crimson running attack that trampled over the Leopard defense for the entire game. The Ivy League’s most prolific rushing offense from a year ago has slowed down a bit this season with the successful addition of Hatch at quarterback.
But on Saturday, the offensive unit came to do work, gaining 311 yards on the ground and more than doubling the team’s total rushing yardage on the season. This was also Harvard’s highest rushing total in a game since the 2008 season.
Gordon himself rushed for 170 yards on 12 attempts for an impressive average of 14.2 yards per carry and tallied two touchdowns in the victory, giving him a total of 231 yards on 28 carries on the season with three touchdowns. He also did not have a single turnover.
After a great return on the opening kickoff, the offense marched down the field in just under four minutes. The opening drive was then capped off by Gordon’s two-yard option run into the end zone, putting the first points on the scoreboard.
Gordon’s second rushing touchdown was one to remember, especially for the senior himself. On Harvard’s first possession after halftime, the offensive unit found itself backed into a tight spot: on the 26-yard line on its side of the field in a third-and-long situation. With 15 yards to go for the first down, an inexperienced quarterback at the reins, and a comfortable lead, Harvard coach Tim Murphy decided to go for the smart, safe play.
The plan was to give Gordon the ball to tack on a couple more yards before punting on fourth down or possibly even get a first down to just keep the drive alive if they were lucky. Instead, Murphy got a 74-yard run from his senior tailback and another touchdown to boot.
“Our offensive line does a great job, you know, making holes,” Gordon said. “Our wide receivers also do a great job staying on their blocks...That’s why I was able to make those cuts, you know, to cut all the way back [across the field]. The back side wide receiver was able to make sure that corner didn’t get me.”
His 74-yard run was the longest of his collegiate career, and it was also the longest run for the Crimson in four years since Clifton Dawson ’07 had a 74-yard touchdown run of his own against Dartmouth in 2006.
Gordon has been a standout his entire career at Harvard, and the Crimson running back has compiled a hefty resume of accomplishments over his four years in Cambridge. His leadership, experience, and success have garnered respect for him from all of his teammates, especially his fellow running backs Scales and sophomore Rich Zajeski.
“[He] is a great guy, a constant mentor to the running back corps,” Scales said. “He gets on guys’ cases if he thinks they’re slacking. He is one of the driving forces for this team. He’s always pushing everyone to reach their fullest potential, to be as good as they can possibly be.”
There is healthy competition growing amongst the three tailbacks and, unsurprisingly, that has pushed Gordon to strive to improve his game even more.
“He has a drive like no other and such a high energy level,” Scales said. “He is always flying across the field no matter what we’re doing, anything from footwork drills to first-team offense-defense scrimmages to the games themselves. But he still maintains such a humble, grounded air about him. He is who I strive to emulate, the type of player and type of person that I want to grow into.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a recent interview with BlackBook Magazine,  Deerhunter frontman Bradford Cox identified his own Atlanta four-piece  as a somewhat erratic collection of music makers: "I think we’re more of  a band that’s schizophrenic," he said, "We don’t know what we want to  be." If that’s the diagnosis, Deerhunter’s fourth LP, "Halcyon Digest,"  embraces of this schizophrenia and milks it for all it’s worth. Their  latest release captures, blends, and celebrates a wide array of sounds  and styles more so than any of their previous records. On the whole, the  record feels deeply satisfying—the tracks are consistently well  crafted, and more importantly, the musical exploration here feels  genuinely uninhibited. The end product ultimately benefits from reveling  its own unpredictability and inconsistencies.

Deerhunter’s songwriting on "Halcyon Digest" makes  melody central and atmosphere secondary—this album marks Deerhunter’s  movement toward simpler, pop-influenced structures. Unfortunately, some  songs fall victim to this new musical paradigm—"Don’t Cry," and "Memory  Boy" are built around easy verse-chorus-verse structures and their  mid-tempo quarter note patterns feel somewhat uninspired. Apart from  some lackluster tracks, however, "Halcyon Digest" succeeds at mining a  rich diversity of material from this stripped-down, more accessible  musical aesthetic.
For instance, this record finds Deerhunter making  forays into legitimate lo-fi aesthetics. Tracks like "Basement Scene"  and, in particular, "Sailing" feel like first-takes in the studio. The  latter pares away almost all of Deerhunter’s usual instrumentation,  leaving Cox’s delicate falsetto to float above a lone, meandering guitar  line. Factor in the bed of ambient sounds, and the song achieves a  hypnotic, dazed euphoria.
In "Halcyon Digest," Deerhunter also indulge in new  timbres that are atypical to their sound. "Revival"—the infectious first  single from this LP—relies heavily on a jangling mandolin riff, and  "Memory Boy" seamlessly mixes harmonica into its instrumental palette.  The most conspicuous addition, however, are the saxophone skills of Bill  Oglesby, who contributes to two tracks on the album. On the  irresistible "Coronado" Oglesby gets to riff joyously over the bright,  upbeat chord progression.
Unexpected moments of transcendence result from the  musical experimentation throughout "Halcyon Digest." Deerhunter spin  some stunning phrases out of relatively mundane musical elements.  "Desire Lines"—a sprawling track penned by guitarist Lockett  Pundt—starts with a driving bass line that carries the song through a  few verses and straight into the jaw-dropping four-minute guitar solo  that is the heart of the song.
The highlight of the entire album, however, has to be  its closing track, "He Would Have Laughed," which is a tribute to the  late garage rocker Jay Reatard. Cox recorded the sprawling eight-minute  epic separately from the rest of the album. Nostalgia tints much of  Cox’s work, and oftentimes he can make memories feel quite dark. So it  comes as a surprise that "He Would Have Laughed" takes the memory of  Reatard and instills it with a sense of lightness and placidity,  building the song around an ascending guitar line and chiming electronic  tones. The track is easily the finest "Halcyon Digest" has to offer,  effortlessly conjuring joy and sorrow in a stirring tribute to Reatard’s  memory.
Overall, "Halcyon Digest" is an exciting and engaging  listen from start to finish. Throughout the record, there are several  points where musical and aesthetic choices come as a surprise, but more  often than not, these unexpected moments are genuinely exciting to hear.  Call them schizophrenic, but if "Halcyon Digest," is any indication,  that just means Deerhunter is on a path to more bold musical  exploration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In many ways, “Le Noise” finds Neil Young emulating traditional blues men. Instead of striving to reignite the rockstar sparks of his earlier career, Young takes a more reserved, stripped-down approach on “Le Noise,” distilling the full-band noise-making machine that was Crazy Horse down to its most essential components: Young’s roaring guitar and his cracked, soaring voice. Its spare instrumentation is culled from singer-songwriters, but the throbbing guitars are undoubtedly from Young’s Crazy Horse days. Young’s last two albums, while respectable, have seemed slightly irrelevant. The meandering “Prairie Wind” felt like an uninspired throwback to his Americana-folk side, while “Living With War” was a somewhat antiquated response to the Iraq War. His latest album, “Le Noise,” veers sharply away from this irrelevance, and stands as an impressive distillation of a remarkable career.
The album begins with the slow-burner “Walk With Me,” a song which sets the album’s tone. The explosive fuzz of a solo electric bursts through the speakers. Young’s voice is enveloped in a dizzying delay effect, which only accentuates his strong vocal performance. The song is interrupted by occasional feedback-interludes where Young engages his guitar’s full sonic capacities. One would expect the track’s bone-crushing thump to be accompanied by swaggering, Zeppelin-like drums, but Young’s tasteful use of feedback and his indulgent guitar playing make the song feel complete without a full band.
This aural adventuring is what makes the tried and true Neil Young-style feel new and exciting. The guitars on “Someone’s Gonna Rescue You” fizz and gurgle their way through an otherwise standard rocker. The incendiary high notes echo the melody while he anchors the track with a muddled, rhythmic drone. Though the instrumentation of the tracks is relatively spare, Young and famed producer Daniel Lanois create rich, undulating patchworks of distorted guitar, which successfully emphasize Young’s distinctive brand of noise.
Surprisingly, Lanois’s production isn’t as noticeable as it is on some of his most famous work with U2. Unlike the shimmering gloss of U2’s 1984 “The Unforgettable Fire,” with its whale-song guitars, Lanois focuses mainly on providing a richness of sound that grants every nuance of Young’s feedback its due. He frequently employs basic vocal and guitar effects, which deepen the sound, but these are always secondary to Young’s own sonic adventuring, and the album is better for it.
There are traditional singer-songwriter numbers like “Peaceful Valley Boulevard” whose dreary acoustic chords accompany Young’s rough retelling of American history. The scratched and muted strings starkly contrast the impeccable production values. The acoustic shivers delicately, and Young’s voice occasionally trails off in spiraling flights of delay, but is otherwise bare and exposed. Sonic touches like these make the album an innovative and complete take on Neil Young’s style.
The lyrics on “Le Noise” aren’t particularly memorable. They include trademark Young imagery like “winds of fate,” which can border on cliché; there are, however, some political, yet heartfelt songs like “Love and War.” It is a beautiful modernization of an otherwise typical Neil Young war-song. Lines like, “They pray to Allah and they pray to the Lord” signal Young’s desire to stay current despite his attraction to age old themes. The song eventually becomes autobiographical, with Young singing, “Sang songs about love and sang songs about war since the back streets of Toronto” and eventually concluding, “I sang for justice and I hit a bad chord, but I still try to sing about love and war.”
“Le Noise” is an effective album because it doesn’t try too hard. Neil Young isn’t desperately attempting to recapture the ragged glory of his youth, nor is he trying to reinvent himself late in his career. Instead, “Le Noise” finds him indulging in some of his most time-honored pursuits: noise-making, exploring and destructing traditional singer-songwriter themes and instrumentations. “Le Noise” is a brilliant combination of the different facets of his career, and it will easily remind fans of Young why they love him without evoking nostalgia.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a distinct moment from my wrestling matchup with JP O’Connor ’10 when I realized that the grappler is not a normal human being.
This revelation did not occur when he effortlessly lifted me into the air and twirled me above his head, nor when he pinned me to the ground with his hands tied behind his back. (These things really did happen; video proof can be found tomorrow at TheCrimson.com).
But no, these things did not really surprise me. After all, O’Connor went 35-0 as a senior at Harvard, won the 2010 NCAA national championship, and is currently training for the 2012 Olympics, while I am a nerdy kid who plays fantasy football.
So when I found myself lying on my back just ten seconds into the match with my limbs flailing in the air, I can’t say that I was all that surprised.
In fact, the moment I realized that O’Connor is not a normal human being did not even occur on the wrestling mat—it happened after our “contest” when he was telling me about his post-Harvard life.
One might expect a person training to wrestle in the Olympics to have a pretty jam-packed schedule. But O’Connor takes it to another level.
On top of his own personal training, O’Connor is serving as a volunteer assistant coach for the Harvard wrestling team and is preparing to apply to medical school.
If things go the way O’Connor hopes, he will have a pretty busy next couple of years. The plan as it stands now is to take the MCAT this January, wrestle at the 2011 World Championships this summer, apply to medical school, compete at the 2012 Olympics in London next summer, and then head off to medical school the following fall.
“Hopefully I can apply to school and be ready to go in right after the Olympics in 2012, whether I make it or not,” O’Connor said.
The native of Oxford, N.Y., plans on going into school with an open mind, but if forced to choose now, he would like to study orthopedics with the hope of one day working as a trainer for a professional or college sports team. But now he is still focusing on the first step—getting into school.
While medical schools often accept less than five percent of applicants, the acceptance rate for the U.S. Wrestling team is even lower.
The U.S. will send just 14 male grapplers to London for the 2012 games, one from each of the seven weight classes to compete in the freestyle and Greco Roman events. If O’Connor is to be the 163-pound representative for the freestyle competition, he will have to beat out other hopefuls at the Olympic Trials in May of 2012. The winner of the competition will punch his ticket to London.
While O’Connor is coming off a dominating senior season in which he defeated each of his opponents en rout to the national championship, winning the Olympic Trials will not be a simple task.
For one, O’Connor will have to take on older, more experienced opponents while he tries to make the transition from collegiate style to freestyle wrestling—one of the international techniques used at the Olympics.  While the two styles are similar, they have some important differences.
“Collegiate is more about controlling your opponent and dominating your opponent, whereas the international styles are more about exposure,” O’Connor said. “You’re trying to expose your opponent’s back for just a second. There are more explosive techniques and it’s more of a strategical game.”
Helping O’Connor to make the transition is a handful of coaches and wrestlers with a wealth of international experience, including Harvard assistant coaches Muzaffar Abdurakhmanov—a three-time Uzbekistan National Champion—and Sean Harrington—who spent four years at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., after college.
O’Connor is also working with former Crimson wrestler Dustin Denunzio ’99 who served as an alternate on the national team after graduating from Harvard.
While O’Connor has learned a great deal from his mentors, he has also spent time doing some coaching himself. After flying all over the country to teach at wrestling camps last summer, O’Connor returned to Cambridge this fall to work with the Harvard wrestling team while he trains.
“To be honest with you, I’ve always loved helping other guys,” O’Connor said. “When you’re in the wrestling room, you can really feed off of each other… Also, it’s fun to be able to see how the other side of it works.”
But before O’Connor can think of settling into a coaching role, he still has some work to accomplish on his own.
“Priority number one is trying to make the Olympic team for 2012—and studying for the MCAT,” O’Connor said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As one of the largest accidental oil spills was occurring following the explosion of a BP drilling rig in April 2010, the Obama administration promptly issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Although environmental activists who feel that it should be extended generally laud the moratorium, the directive has oil executives and Gulf Coast officials concerned for the economic repercussions of drilling cessation. At this time, the necessity of offshore drilling validates the removal of the moratorium, given that obligatory precautions are taken for environmental purposes. Even though the moratorium was the correct response to the oil spill for the time instituted, we eagerly await its imminent removal.
The order immobilized 33 exploratory drilling projects and suspended new permits in an attempt to further investigate the cause of the explosion. Nearly six months later, it is time to allow those jobs to resume. Importantly, the drilling will not recommence without added precautions; recently, the Interior Department released new rules regarding offshore drilling, regulating processes of cementing, blowout preventers, safety certification, emergency response, and worker training. These rules should provide offshore drillers with unambiguous guidelines and terms under which drilling may resume when the current moratorium is lifted. The Gulf oil spill—which killed 11 people aboard the oil rig Deepwater Horizon and leaked approximately 60,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf waters until the oil rig was capped—was partly a result of incompetence and partly due to culpable dealings between the industry and regulators. As such, more stringent regulations are an appropriate response to negligence and improper monitoring of oil rigs before the spill and will hopefully keep such issues at bay in the future.
Still, the regulations should not have a sizable impact on the industry in terms of dissuading companies from continuing to drill. Oil companies can likely charge forth without significant adverse effects from regulations while also implementing safer practices for offshore drilling that will ideally minimize spills—although the new regulations will make drilling safer, they will not revolutionize the entire process. Moreover, because the technical features of off-shore drilling—including being remotely located from infrastructure and the sheer quantity and cost of required accommodations and equipment—make the costs of drilling on offshore rigs itself higher than land-drilling costs, the significant expenses of offshore drilling are inherent in the act of drilling itself. Therefore, it is not expected that the regulations will not make it cost-prohibitive.
Although we believe that drilling is acceptable for the current stage we are at in terms of oil usage, we do hope that there is an eventual move toward the utilization of nuclear energy. Developing alternative forms of energy could eliminate the controversial and possibly catastrophic political and environmental ends that accompany offshore drilling and America’s continued dependence on oil. Therefore, though we advocate for the lifting of the moratorium and find offshore drilling with strongly enforced regulations a viable option at the present time, it is worthwhile to consider the possibilities of alternative forms of energy for the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s surprising how often criticism can prove more interesting than the thing it purports to attack. In the art world, for instance, creative criticism is often appropriated by the maligned themselves: “Donatello au milieu des fauves!” sneered Louis Vauxcelles at the 1905 Salon d’Automne, a put-down painters took up with delight when they realized their striking, colorful works could at last be united under the “beastly” name Fauvism.
New U.K. Labour Leader Ed Miliband is less likely to embrace the moniker bequeathed him. “[Current Prime Minister David] Cameron to use ‘Red Ed’ as rallying call for centre ground,” a headline in The Independent announced Sunday; though “Red Ed” has been the preferred Tory attack on Miliband for some time, now it’s the official line. Miliband’s response to jibes was rather humorless: “Wallace out of Wallace and Gromit—I can see the resemblance. Forrest Gump—not so much. And what about Red Ed? Come off it!”
At times, one wonders what would happen if Miliband borrowed a bit more from his critics. Far from being “red,” Miliband has actively distanced himself from any whiff of “extremism”—making a show of coming out against a recent union strike, for example. In his debut address last week, he insisted that even in childhood his older brother (whom he edged out by a 1.3 percent margin for the leadership) was further left than him: “On the day I stole his football, he was so angry he nationalized my train set.” Adorable: until the BBC pans to David’s awkward smile, and one realizes how strategic the joke’s meant to be.
If he lacks their boldness, Miliband is “comme les fauvistes” in at least one way. “Britain’s big question of the next decade,” he wrote in The Guardian, “is whether we head towards an increasingly U.S.-style capitalism—more unequal, more brutish, more unjust—or whether we can build a different model, a capitalism that works for people and not the other way around.” Miliband too wants a fauve, but his beast of choice sounds closer to a Leviathan. In contrast to this imagined Britain, he chooses the word “brutish,” with all its Hobbesian resonances, to describe American capitalism—a word conjuring up an unsympathetic, pre-social contract state of nature (“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”). Merriam-Webster defines “brutish” as merely sensual, or unthinking. One might therefore assume that Miliband wants more thinking up top and more power conferred on the state as central planner.
That’s not what his policies propose. He’s not advocating social democracy, a mixed economy, or even renationalization of the railways (a move most British voters—including Tories—support). Instead he’s insisted, with some irritation, on his position as a “centrist.” The crucial question, given Cameron’s implementation of drastic new “austerity measures”—which include huge cuts to government programs and university fee hikes—is what that centrism means and whether it’s viable. On the economic front, Labour can sometimes seem to have on rose-tinted glasses; certainly the situation can occasionally appear dire—or absurd. The Bank of England recommends that to boost the economy people spend their reserve cash; in the London Review of Books, Jenny Diski wonders whether that means she should start purchasing fancy knickers at Net-a-Porter or just stock up on loads more undies at good old Marks & Spencer.
What’s interesting, in any case, is how much force the “red” label still has, given how far Britain has drifted to the right over the past few decades. Few would be quicker to point this out than Miliband’s father, were he alive today. Ralph Miliband, née Adolphe, was a well-known socialist intellectual, who after catching a boat from Brussels in the 40s to flee anti-semitism proceeded to pen several books, including The State in Capital Society and Parliamentary Socialism. A longtime professor at the London School of Economics and close friend of C. Wright Mills, he questioned the ability of the state to effect real change under the current economic structure. Both his sons have worked to distance themselves from him on the record; neither would have received his vote. (Their mum, still living, has said her ballot will go to a third-party candidate. And a very happy holidays they are in the Miliband home.)
Miliband was the right choice for Labour, and his selection remains promising. But he has yet to give any indication of how his program will seriously differ from that of his predecessors. Politics can be a beastly business; the goad “Red Ed” offers opportunity for thought. Honing his policies in weeks ahead, rather than simply lash out at the label as “tiresome and rubbish” Miliband ought to soberly assess the struggles of his father’s generation as he attempts to build a new capitalism.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Far more valuable than oil or precious metals, there’s a secret resource that every country in the world has to bolster economic development. From the world’s poorest country, Afghanistan, to its growing economic powers throughout Africa and Asia, there is a major growth factor that has not even come close to its full economic potential.
This extraordinary growth factor is the world’s women, who are still prevented from reaching their full economic potential in many countries. They represent a full half of the world’s human capital and are all potential entrepreneurs, managers, and scientists with the ability to drive forward a country’s economy. As countries look to create more rapid and inclusive growth, it is imperative that female education and employment be a major part of any growth policy.
Empowering women has countless economic benefits for developing countries. As Nicholas D. Kristof ’81 and Sheryl WuDunn write in “Half the Sky,” educated and empowered women are able to contribute to a country’s development by working in productive jobs, reducing the growth rate of the population, financing education for their younger relatives, and improving the health, nutrition, and financial decisions of their families. They remark that it could be called the “double X” solution, and it certainly is a unique factor that separates wealthy countries from struggling ones.
It is impossible to imagine a developed country without women having careers, deciding how many children to have, and raising a healthy family, and, indeed, economists from the World Bank and investment banks alike have argued that countries cannot grow at full potential when they suffer from gender inequality. In a seminal 2008 report, Goldman Sachs argued that “narrowing the gender gap in employment” in developing countries could “push income per capita as much as 14 percent higher than our baseline projections by 2020.”
The major methods of empowering females are educating girls and, along with that, making it easier for them to work. Through education, girls gain the skills and knowledge to seek productive employment and raise healthier, smaller, and wealthier families. In the developing world today, “girls are disproportionately kept out of school… And the girls who do attend primary school are far less likely to complete it than are boys in Egypt, India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey.” The education gap in many developing countries only gets worse as girls get older.
There are numerous policies that countries can implement to increase the education of women. Most importantly, they can combat the costs associated with families losing their girls’ ability to do work at home by paying families to send their girls to school, as both Brazil and Mexico have done with considerable success.
Along with educating girls, governments must make it easier for women to work. Anti-discrimination laws are often on the books, but they must be strictly enforced if they are to be effective. Especially when a country is trying to remedy a long-standing gender discrimination problem, companies should be given incentives for hiring women. Private industry, governments, and nonprofit groups can make it easier for women to access credit so that they can gain financial independence and become entrepreneurs, as they have notably done throughout South Asia.
These changes in education and employment won’t come without major changes in cultural attitudes. Two summers ago, I worked in India, where the business world often seemed a giant boys’ club. Sure, there were exceptions here and there, but I could go to meetings and work for weeks without substantive interactions with women. I was not too surprised: India is a country where old cultural male chauvinist attitudes persist at almost every level. Families are far more excited to have sons than daughters, sex slavery is rampant, and domestic abuse is a huge problem.
Working in China, however, my experience could not have been more different. Throughout the workplace at my organization, equal gender participation was the norm. It was surely not perfect, but with women working everywhere, it was clear that China had made a conscious and successful effort to elevate the status of women throughout the economic and domestic spheres of society.
These are just anecdotes, but they are supported by the evidence: Women only constitute 28 percent of the labor force in India, but they make up 44 percent of the labor force in China. At every level of education, there are more girls in school in China than in India, and, surely enough, Goldman Sachs reports that a one percent increase in female education raises Gross Domestic Product by 0.37 percent and GDP growth rates by 0.2 percent.
These numbers explain much of the difference between China, now the world’s second-largest economy, and India, which still has hundreds of million people living in starving poverty. China has transformed Chairman Mao’s words that “women hold up half the sky” into reality and has displayed that until women are equal partners in the learning, work, and future of a society, a nation cannot achieve prosperity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the heart of Maxwell-Dworkin Laboratory, Professor Harry R. Lewis ’68 rests his hands on a desk cluttered with old hard drives and a chunky 15GB iPod, its back open to expose its intricate hardware. This is to be expected: Lewis is a professor of computer science. And yet the walls, the carpeted floor, and even the free countertops are overwhelmingly covered with stacks and stacks of books. A pioneer in the booming digital field, Lewis—like so many of us—still surrounds himself each day with beloved paperbacks and hardcovers.
As the former Dean of Harvard College, Lewis is very familiar with the reading habits of our ‘digital generation.’ Readers can tap glittering iPad screens to jump from chapter to chapter, and respond to ‘tweets’ in between. “The digitalization of reading material—and the death of deep reading—is an interesting debate with violent feelings on both sides,” he says.
There is no doubt that the advent of the Digital Age has transformed how readers read and writers write. In response to these developments, several courses have sprung up in both the History of Science and English departments to investigate the changing relationship between reader and writer in the digital age. In late October the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study will also host an interdisciplinary conference entitled “Why Books?” to explore the interaction between literature and technology from an historical perspective.
The experts involved in this discourse all agree that new technology is redefining our experience of literature; they differ only in their focus. Some argue that our critical interpretation of literature must necessarily adjust to these new developments. Others add that writers themselves are adjusting to cater to readers behind LCD screens. However, the interplay between scientific advance and literary work can be traced to authors writing long before the digital age. In the greater historical context of the book, even the shift from print to digital form is not entirely unique; it is but another important transition in the long chain of the book’s evolution.
DIGITAL DIVERSIONS
Though Lewis has devoted his career to the innovations of computer science, he remains a traditionalist when it comes to the written word. Gesturing toward the stacks of bound volumes behind him, Lewis says, “I don’t mean to be a curmudgeon, but it was challenging to read through ‘War and Peace’ before the Kindle. Now it’s difficult to read just a page of ‘War and Peace’ without going to check your email.”
Like many, he is concerned that the attention and imagination required to read difficult texts is disappearing with the fast-paced clicks and taps of electronic books. “I worry that people growing up today are losing the experience of deep reading—of losing yourself entirely in a novel and trying on new identities,” Lewis says. “How can you do so if a hyperlink or an email jolts you back into the here-and-now?”
In a June 2010 essay for the New York Times entitled “My Backlogged Pages,” author John Feffer explains his similar reluctance to give up his physical library. He links their physical presence to their imaginative power. “They are just not books after all,” he writes. “Provided I hold on to this library, I can still pretend that I will be all the people that I imagined I would be as a teenager, as I wandered the church book sale and selected gifts for my future selves.”
One person who seeks to understand the dilemma of the reader in this digital era is Associate Professor Adelheid Voskuhl in the History of Science department. Voskuhl is an historian of technology who uses literary theory to explore the relationship between technology, the text, and its author. Her new course, History of Science 284: “Technology and the Text: Machines and Discourse in Historical and Literary Inquiry,” questions how our interpretation of text and its media may change in the future.
Beginning half a century ago, she says, literary theorists started to think that not a single element of the text—about the literature itself or its medium—could be neglected in critical interpretation. “In the 1960s, scholars no longer took for granted that text is simply what’s written on the page—there is always a medium for the text, an author, and an intention,” Voskuhl says.
However, this theory came into being in a world of print. “Even if I were to attempt the standard practice of interpreting a poem, how would my interpretation change from print to digital media? Would my computer be a part of the text itself? Does the act of clicking a hyperlink bring the autonomy of the reader and writer into question?” Voskuhl says. “In the digital age, we theorists are struggling to find what we can translate from those earlier decades.”
New technologies certainly require a more nuanced theoretical approach. However, Voskuhl remains faithful to her pursuit. “Theories of technology can be wacky and abstract, but it is vital to engage in intensive theoretical reflection. Without it, we run the risk of approaching the Kindle or the iPad in a commonplace, bland kind of way,” she says.
A TECHNOLOGICAL TRADEOFF
These technologies, and the way they are consumed, also influence the way that writers cater to their readers. Feffer describes his own dilemmas as a writer in a world of digital innovation. “For me, my desire to communicate rapidly with as wide an audience as possible is juxtaposed with my nostalgia for readers with the luxury to read and digest my work thoughtfully,” he says.
This goal, Feffer continues, is hard to reach. “We live in a utilitarian time, and Americans think first about usefulness and purpose—what we read is linked first and foremost to what we do.” With its long threads of blog commentary and never-ending tweets, digital media is a prime example of this bias towards utility.
However, digital media also facilitates a profoundly democratic movement in literature. “Technological innovation encourages more and more people into the writing process. The influx of creativity and free thought is empowering, no matter the form or quality of literature,” he says.
Despite his nostalgia, Feffer believes that the advent of digital technology does not cause but merely accelerates an independent literary trend that he has observed for nearly two decades. “I think digital media is something new, of course, but it is a part of a larger context: a move to cater to a shorter attention span, multi-tasking, and a desire for concise, provocative writing that cannot be misunderstood,” he says.
He illustrates his point by comparing the writing styles of American and British academics twenty years ago. “While American writers had a rapid and clear style, British writers were more discursive, and tended to wander. However, over the past two decades, English-speaking writers from many countries began to write in the shorter, less digressive American style. One could argue that it’s an inquisition, and I argue that this inquisition is in keeping with technology as well,” Feffer says. “The technology only encourages us more to write in this manner.”
THE MACHINE AS MUSE
Even when new technologies do not explicitly bear on the consumption of literature, writers have actively responded to the work of their scientific contemporaries. “Today’s digital age is not the only instance when literary transformations have paralleled these scientists’ technological innovations,” Feffer says.
The same kind of interplay occurred, for example, during the booming development of the 1920s. “At the same time that the typewriter and telegraph became commonplace, Ernest Hemingway was determined to change the ornate Victorian form and incorporating concise, journalistic writing into his fiction,” he says. Just like the current digital age, the internationalism of the 1920s stressed brevity, condensation, and speed both on the technological front and in the literary realm.
Professor Peter L. Galison’s new seminar, History of Science 292: “Gravity’s Rainbow,” explores one literary response to technology through close analysis of Thomas Pynchon’s postmodern masterpiece. Published in 1973, “Gravity’s Rainbow” grapples with the Cold War world and the proliferation of nuclear weapons; the title itself refers to the parabolic trajectory of a V-2 rocket in freefall. “In a way, Pynchon is trying to confront the technological world and show that it is so much more than black and white or good and evil,” Galison says. “The scientific and technological commentary in the book is a reflection of the world that we inherited. It foreshadowed some troubling aspects of our age, such as the concern over digitalization of literature.”
English 90zt: “Techno-Lit: Images of Scientific Ideas in Fiction” is Professor Daniel Albright’s related effort to examine literary texts and the scientific innovations that distressed or inspired them. Albright originally team-taught the course with a physicist at the University of Rochester; “It was one of the most rewarding experiences of my whole life,” he says. Tentatively to be offered in the upcoming spring or fall semester, the class will explore the relationship between scientific and literary giants like Voltaire and Leibniz or Beckett and Heidegger. According to Albright, the parallels between physicists’ and artists’ rhetoric during the twentieth century were extensive and profound. For instance, he says, “during the tumultuous beginnings of atomic theory, Whitman and Kandinsky were on the search for their own ‘basic unit’ of non-representational, abstract poetry.” The course will highlight how these kinds of technological conflicts and innovations dramatically affected contemporary artists and writers.
DISSECTING THE TEXT
The most obvious change in reading and writing, however, is the decline of the book as a physical object. Books are rapidly transforming into digital files stored on virtual bookshelves. Still, the movement from book to iPad or Kindle may be only a surface-level development. As Professor of English Leah Price ’91 puts it, “Is the ‘book’ an object made out of paper, or is it rather a set of functions? If it’s the latter, the book isn’t dead—it’s just using various digital forms to serve the same function.”
In order to explore the fate of the book in the future, Price formed a partnership with Professor Ann M. Blair ’84 to teach a faculty seminar called “The History of the Book” at the Harvard Humanities Center. In October, they will also present a conference on the topic at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study called “Why Books?”
“I am a literary critic and Ann is a historian, but we both approach the book from a long historical perspective, with a focus on the evolution of literacy, changing uses of the book, and the ages, gender, and cultures of readers,” Price says. Within this framework, the question of print versus digital media must be explored in the context of the book’s prior historical revolutions—such as those from the clay tablet to the scroll to the bound book.
On October 28 and 29, Price and Blair will tackle the topic together with a group of scholars, students, curators, and librarians who care for Harvard’s tremendously rich material resources and yet lack easy opportunities for collaboration. The conference will be opened by a round-table discussion between computer scientist Professor Stuart M. Schreiber ’81 and Professor Robert Darnton ’60, the Director of the Harvard University Library system. They will discuss Shieber’s Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard, a new open-access digital database of Harvard faculty publications, and its implications on the future of the library.
“The history of the book is a multi-disciplinary enterprise,” Price says. For a proper treatment of the book’s history, the conference will unite lawyers discussing intellectual property rights, computer scientists highlighting new ways to transmit texts, historians exploring how books are used as tools, businessmen explaining the economic aspects of publishing, and sociologists tracing the role of the book in society. “This is why the Radcliffe Institute is the perfect home for our conference—it is an ideal space for experimentation and interdisciplinary innovation,” she says.
The “Why Books?” conference will also venture outside of the Radcliffe Institute on Thursday, October 28 to visit archives and printing presses of yore, including the Baker Library Historical Collections, the Harvard University Press, the Bow and Arrow Press, and the Weissman Preservation Center. “We wanted to give the conference a more tactile sense because books are so often thought of as virtual, disembodied objects, and present valuable Harvard University resources that are usually closed to the general public,” Price says.
Voskuhl agrees that this tactile approach is vital for truly understanding the transformation of literature. Holding up a single dusty volume in her office, she says, “Imagine this book. When I pick it up, I can think about when the text came into being, who the author was hanging out with at the time, estimate how expensive it was, how many copies were printed, how widely it was circulated, who could afford it at the time, and what it meant to be reading a book at the time.”
RHETORICAL RELICS
Perhaps Feffer will not have to relinquish as much as he thought. The heated conversation about the digital age began, and continues on, because a certain deference to the printed book remains. “We still refer to our family computers as ‘desktops’ and view computer screens in vertical or landscape ‘page layout,’” Price says. Thus the language associated with the book as a physical entity lives on in our parlance, just as the lifestyle it inspired is still accessible through digital media. Even when the transition from book to screen has become pervasive, it seems readers and writers will still keep their favorites on a dusty bookshelf.

“Lonely Avenue” is exactly what anyone would expect from a  collaborative work involving Ben Folds and Nick Hornby – cerebral, melancholy, and musically adventurous. Hornby, a prolific writer and music reviewer, best known for his novels “About a Boy” and “High Fidelity,” wrote the lyrics, while Folds wrote the music. Because of this division of labor, there is a constant battle between the lyrics and the instrumentation of “Lonely Avenue,” and at times the album sounds more like a series of in-depth character studies set to unrelated music as opposed to a cohesive album.
The album is clearly written for an intellectual audience, or at least one that is well-versed in cultural references that are no longer immediately obvious. The album’s title, “Lonely Avenue,” pays homage to Doc Pomus, the famed songwriter who penned Ray Charles’s hit of the same name in 1956. Pomus is also the subject of one of the early songs on the album—“He could never be one of those happy cripples / the kind that smile and tell you life’s okay,” sings Folds on “Doc Pomus.”
Pomus is not the only famous individual featured on the album; Sarah Palin’s almost-son-in-law, Levi Johnston, is the subject of “Levi Johnston’s Blues.” The chorus, “I’m a fucking redneck / I live to hang out with my boys, play some hockey / and kill some moose,” at first seems like an condemnation of Johnston, but ends up being a nod to the confusion he must have felt as a “redneck” attacked by the vicious media with a girlfriend who served as little more than a political pawn. This is Hornby’s gift as a writer turned songwriter—he makes listeners empathize with his characters, even if he is rewriting unsympathetic characters embedded in the collective consciousness.
Folds’s instrumentation on “Lonely Avenue” is as successful as Hornby’s songwriting. The banging and clashing rock stylings of “Saskia Hamilton” (named after an American poet) provide a unique moment on the piano-heavy album. The driving percussion creates a mood of manic obsession well, one of the few moments on the album in which the tone of the music and the meaning of the lyrics match. Folds very effectively creates mood with music; on “From Above,” the minor chord progressions and haunting background vocals contrast with the perky beat in a dissonant way, creating an otherworldly soundscape and a very particular shade of moodiness. “Your Dogs” employs similar tactics by mixing electronic transitions with a pounding beat, bouncing piano, and numerous time changes to create an angrily happy, or perhaps happily angry mood.
Unfortunately, the strengths of Hornby and Folds don’t quite mesh on “Lonely Avenue”. “From Above,” one of the best songs of the album, is about two soulmates who exist in the same space but never find each other—“Sure we all have soulmates / but we walk past them everyday”—and the otherworldly, generally perky music doesn’t fit with the subject matter. Similarly, “Picture Window,” with the thought-provoking lyrics, “Hope is a bastard / hope is a liar / a cheat and a tease,” is not quite a match for the nasal singing and the soaring orchestration that Folds provides.
“Lonely Avenue” is more of an intellectual exercise than an album for pleasurable listening. At the same time, Hornby’s character vignettes are a pleasure and Folds’s singing and creative instrumentation are as good as they always are, making the album an overall success. At the very least, it inspires a desire to look up the life stories of Doc Pomus, Saskia Hamilton, and Levi Johnston, providing a Wikipedia adventure nearly as long as the 45-minute album.

UPDATED: Oct. 6, 2010, 2:09 a.m. Porcellian photo added.
In light of the recent release of “The Social Network” and the fact that we’re now in the middle of second round punch events, Harvard’s final club scene is bound to be on the minds of many sophomores and juniors. In order to shed some light on what can otherwise be a mysterious process, we decided to put together this series related to all things “punch.” Check back each day this week for new material on the subject.
A.D. Club
Address: 1 Plympton St.
Date founded: 1836
Brief history: Originally a branch of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, it surrendered its charter in 1865. Although the club has occupied its current location since 1900, the City of Cambridge momentarily took possession of the club in March 2008, after it failed to pay over $41,000 in taxes.
Famous alumni: Benjamin C. Bradlee '43-'44
Delphic Club
 Address: 9 Linden St.
Date founded: 1848
Brief history: When J.P. Morgan, Jr., class of 1889, didn’t get into his club of choice, he, according to The Crimson, financed  the creation of his own club—the Delphic—out of an existing frat, Delta Phi. Apparently, after its creation, there were only a few members, so the club would burn gas lights at all hours to show the world that yes, they were home. As a result, the club earned the nickname of “the Gas.”
Fly Club
 Address: 2 Holyoke Pl.
Date founded: 1836
Brief history: Like the A.D., the Fly also traces its origins back to Harvard’s Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. While the A.D. was formed when it broke its ties with the national fraternity, the Fly is what’s left of the Alpha Delta Phi chapter created in 1836. In 2006, after Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 renounced his membership in the Owl, Deval L. Patrick '78 said he quit the Fly in 1983.
Famous alumni: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904; Deval L. Patrick '78; James B. Conant, class of 1914; A. Lawrence Lowell, Class of 1877; William F. Weld '66
Fox Club 
 Address: 44 JFK St.
Date founded: 1898
Brief history: Originally called the “Digamma Club,” the Fox became known as “the Fox” because the Greek letter “digamma” was seen as similar to the letter “F.”
Famous alumni: Bill Gates; Steve A. Ballmer '77; T.S. Eliot, Class of 1910
Owl Club
 Address: 30 Holyoke St.
Date founded: 1896
Brief history: Founded in 1896 as “Αvλòζχαι’‘Εχπωμα,” Greek for Pipe and Mug, the Owl began as a secret society. In 1897, the club moved to a house at 97 Mt. Auburn Street, changed its name to Phi Delta Psi and abandoned its status as a secret society. The club moved into its current location in 1906 and changed its name to the Owl Club in 1916.
Famous alumni: Harry E. Widener, Class of 1907; Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56
Phoenix S.K. Club
 Address: 72 Mt. Auburn St.
Date founded: 1897 (the founding of the Sphinx club)
Brief history: Formed from the mergers of the S K Club (which was, in turn, formed from the mergers of the Sphinx and Kalumet clubs) and the Phoenix Club, a predecessor to the Phoenix S.K. Club moved into its current building at 72 Mt. Auburn St. in 1916.
Famous alumni: Eduardo L. Saverin '05
Porcellian Club 
 Address: 1324 Mass. Ave.
Date Founded: 1791
Brief history: The Porcellian club, the oldest of Harvard’s final clubs, traces its roots back to “the Argonauts” which began meeting in 1791. In 1794, the group renamed itself “the Pig Club” after a pig was roast at a club gathering. The name was later changed to “Porcellian” (based on the Latin “porcus”) in order to make the club name sound more historical.
Famous alumni: Edward Everett, Class of 1811; Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880; Oliver W. Holmes Jr., Class of 1861
Spee Club 
 Address: 76 Mt. Auburn St.
Date Founded: 1852
Brief history: Originally founded in 1852 as the Rho Epsilon chapter of Zeta Psi, the club was later known as Z P. Over time, the club began to be known as the Spee. The Spee club is known for being the first club to accept an African-American member and for being one of the first clubs to accept Jewish and Catholic members.
Famous alumni: John F. Kennedy '40, Robert F. Kennedy '48

This post has been revised to reflect the following clarification:
CLARIFICATION: October 7, 2010.
An earlier version of the Oct. 5 Flyby post "The Punch: The Men's Final Clubs" did not mention that J. P. Morgan, Jr., class of 1889, helped found the Delphic from Delta Phi, an existing fraternity. Although the Delphic did not exist in its current form before Morgan, the club still claims 1848, the founding date of Delta Phi, as its official founding date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an almost unanimous vote the Cambridge City Council passed a proposal for a moderate residential property tax increase of 5.69 percent, which is expected to net a total of approximately $280 million for the 2011 fiscal year, at yesterday’s council meeting.
“It’s amazing, looking at how much less we paid compared to [other cities] around us, and compared to the services we get in the city,” City Councilor Leland Cheung said in the meeting.
The moderate level of the tax increase was made possible by an increase in non-property tax revenues, such as Parking Fund and sales taxes on meals in local restaurants.
The property tax increase comes in the context of a significant reduction—$1.3 million—in the two major State Aid categories, school aid and general aid, that can be used at the municipality’s discretion. Since FY2009, the state has cut funding to the city by $9.3 million in those two aid categories.
The tax rate increase contained in the proposal is 0.4 percent lower than the one the City Council projected this May.
“I think this is something everyone in the city can be proud of,” Cheung added, referring to the relatively small tax increase.
Echoing Cheung, Councilor Marjorie C. Decker said, “There is no community surrounding us that can come close to what we do here at Cambridge.”
The proposal states that over half of Cambridge residential property owners will see a reduction, no change, or increase of less than $100 in their property tax bill.  Another 32 percent of residents will see their residential tax bills increase by between $100 and $250 this fiscal year.
In addition to the proposed tax increase, the Council made a number of other minor tax adjustments.
The Council voted to classify properties into five categories “for the purpose of allocating property tax,” according to the City Manager Robert W. Healy in a letter addressed to the Council. The process of tax classification allows the city to tax commercial taxpayers at a higher rate than residential taxpayers, according to the document submitted by Healy.
With the proposed changes, residential properties can enjoy “a deduction of up to 30 percent of the average residential parcel value before the tax rate is applied.”
All of the proposed tax changes are subject to approval by the Massachusetts Department of Revenue later this month before they can come into effect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former New Orleans Mayor Marc H. Morial took to the podium last night at the Harvard Graduate School of Design to call for innovation in urban and low-income housing.
Morial currently serves as president of the National Urban League, a century-old civil rights organization that supports development in underprivileged urban communities.
The former mayor advocated a comprehensive government approach to improving low-income neighborhoods.
“You can’t just build housing, you have to build neighborhoods,” said Morial.
Morial, who served as mayor from 1994 to 2002, said the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina on his own city helped expose the nation to some of the problems that surround low-income urban housing.
He said he favored tax incentives that would encourage investment in distressed urban areas and housing benefits directed at low-income public sector workers.
And in the wake of the sub-prime mortgage meltdown, Morial emphasized the need for mandatory mortgage education programs for home buyers.
But Morial also pushed for a departure from traditional housing design. Planners must strive, he said, to understand and meet the needs of the communities of the future.
“We must invest in the best policy and design practice,” he said. He added, for instance, that planning multiple family housing rather than single family homes would be more economical and could in fact better meet the needs of some low-income families.
During his own tenure as mayor, Morial reinvested in older urban neighborhoods and achieved significant reductions in crime, unemployment and poverty, ushering the city through a period of prosperity.
The lecture was “interesting, inspiring and powerful,” said Abbe H. Will, a research assistant at the Joint Center for Housing Studies who attended the talk, pointing in particular to Morial’s ideas on tax incentives for home-buyers and investors.
Organized by the Joint Center for Housing Studies and the National Housing Endowment, yesterday’s lecture is the latest in a series of annual John T. Dunlop lectures which have brought leading figures in housing policy to Harvard over the last decade. Organizer Angela K. Flynn, program and finance assistant at the Joint Center for Housing Studies, said that the lecture series is a great opportunity to bring influential figures such as Morial to Harvard.

House Masters removed the final barrier to the Undergraduate Council’s Student Initiated Programs fund, voting last week in favor of the program that will provide students with grants for beer and wine at public parties.
The SIP marks the first time that the UC will fund alcohol since the dissolution of the party grants program in the fall of 2007.
At the time, administrators expressed concerns of liability with unsupervised student drinking. The UC has since designed the new fund after conversations with House Masters and the administration established a series of precautions that address the liability concerns.
The events will be limited to 100 attendees and will be held in House common spaces. Of the typical $400 SIP grant, $180 will be earmarked for a Beverage Authorization Team that will oversee distribution of alcohol at the event.
The SIP is part of the current UC’s priority to review and improve social life at Harvard. UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 said the fund will allow students who are not affiliated with specific student groups or House Councils to get involved in planning social events.
But even after two pilot events held last spring in Quincy and Pforzheimer,  SIP retains a low profile on campus.
In last spring’s UC student survey, nearly half of all respondents indicated that they had not heard of the program.
And even as SIP expands to all houses, the fund will start small. According to UC Student Initiatives Committee Chair David Gonzalez ’11, the committee hopes to provide funding for five events each semester, for a total of $4,000 in grants this academic year.
SIC will vote to allocate this sum from its budget this week, and the full council will consider the fund at the next general meeting on Sunday. Gonzalez said that he expects the grant application to go live by early next week.
Since last spring’s pilots, SIC has worked with College officials to fine-tune the SIP policies, including removing a $400 charge on the Houses to provide for a HUPD detail.
“The UC can now shoulder the entire financial burden on its own,” Gonzalez said. “That was instrumental in getting it past the House Masters.”
But because the program requires the use of House public spaces and affiliation with the hosting house, each House Master has the ultimate control over whether SIP events will occur in the house.
“I’m expecting that we’ll have some resistance,” UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said. Hysen said that he hopes successful events will encourage more House Masters to host UC-funded parties.
But Hysen also expressed caution about the impact of the new fund.
“No one thinks this is the easy answer to social life,” he said.

Refreshments served at Faculty meetings may no longer include cookies, but at today’s Faculty meeting—the first of this academic year—Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith may offer sunnier news in his report on the school’s finances over the past year.
Although predictions made in the spring state that the school continues to face a $35 million deficit, Smith said last month that he will be able to turn to some of his academic priorities after nearly two years of budget-strapping measures. He plans to close the deficit gap in FAS—Harvard’s largest school—by the summer of 2012.
The University endowment’s 11 percent investment returns over the course of the last fiscal year has also led FAS members to hope for an increased endowment payout—and thus higher spending capabilities—in coming years.
At today’s meeting, Smith will discuss the Dean’s 2010 Annual Report, which outlines FAS revenue and spending policies as they were over the course of last academic year. The draft is available online to some Faculty members and will be made public later in the month.
Dean’s Reports have traditionally been published in the spring semester, but Smith said he wants the information to be available to departments at the beginning of the budget planning process for next year. The official budgeting season does not begin until the spring, but departments have already worked on their preliminary requests to the Dean.
At today’s meeting, Smith will also discuss the planning for a new capital campaign. Harvard’s last capital campaign, which ended in 2001, raised $2.6 billion ($3.2 billion in today’s dollars). But in recent years, the University has repeatedly decided to postpone a new campaign.
“It’s been 10 years since Harvard ended its last campaign,” University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview last March. “That’s a very long time to go between campaigns.”
Although the past years in FAS have seen budget cuts and slimmed hiring, formulating plans for a capital campaign may be one indication that the University believes that its donors are once again prepared to give.
And across FAS, faculty members and administrators alike are hoping that the school can turn away from a discourse of budget cuts.
“I know that this year will be difficult,” said English department chair W. James Simpson. “But with the endowment looking up and with the markets looking up, there may be some light at the end of the tunnels.”

It’s unlikely Harvard’s endowment gained liquidity from one of its most recent purchases, but the move almost certainly increased the University’s holdings in powdered milk.
With the purchase of a 4,000-acre dairy farm in New Zealand two weeks ago, Harvard-owned farms there could produce nearly 4 million pounds annually, local newspapers reported.
Last week Harvard Management Company closed the acquisition of a “super dairy farm” in that country, paying more than 28 million New Zealand dollars, about US$20.7 million, for the property—and its 6,000 head of cattle. The farm once belonged to a local agricultural magnate, and Harvard snapped it up in liquidation.
“In America, [$20.7 million] seems like peanuts,” said Paul Y. Chong, a New Zealand native and first year student at Harvard Business School. “But in a small economy like New Zealand, that’s a pretty substantial investment.”
The New Zealand economy was hit hard by declining export prices during the recession, but has since bounced back and seen rising foreign investment. Nevertheless, local concerns have led to some limits on purchases by foreign organizations. In 2008, a $1.4 billion proposal for Canada’s main pension fund to buy Auckland’s airport was rejected by the country’s Overseas Investment Office, though smaller deals have been approved.
“I think it’s a sign of respect for Harvard,” said Belinda R. J. O’Donnell ’11, another New Zealander, of the purchase. “Quite often they have restrictions in place for foreigners to buy property.”
In addition to its dairy farms, Harvard has other investments in the country, including sizeable tracts of forest that are valued for the timber they provide.
“I had an idea that Harvard is quite creative in its investments,” O’Donnell said. “I was driving down to a rowing camp on the North Island and my dad pointed out a forest to me and said, ‘Oh you know your college bought that a couple of years ago.”
The University’s latest acquisition on the island nation lies in The Maniototo, a rural area some 900 miles south of Auckland, New Zealand’s largest city. Primarily farmland, the area is known for its wines and its appearance in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
Harvard Management Company had no comment for this story. The University generally does not comment on investments or investment strategy.

Associate Economics Professor Erica M. Field was recently named the 2010 recipient of the Elaine Bennett Research Prize.
The biennial award, given by the American Economic Association, recognizes a woman at the beginning of her career for outstanding research in any field of economics.
“I was thrilled when I got the phone call,” said Field, who was notified about two weeks ago. “I was very surprised.”
Having received her Ph.D. from Princeton University in 2003, Field joined the Economics Department at Harvard in the spring of 2005.
“What I do is not traditionally mainstream economics,” Field said. “It’s great that people become more aware of the issue on gender and health development and recognize it as a topic worth researching.”
Field’s primary interests include development economics and labor economics. Her past research topics have focused on the effect of property rights and credit availability on economic development, the nature of marriage contracts in Bangladesh, and the importance of the micronutrient iodine for public health and women’s educational achievement.
Established in 1998, the prize is given in honor of Elaine Bennett, who specialized in experimental economics and mentored many young women pursuing careers in various areas of the field, according to the AEA.
“I feel humbled to be a part of the distinguished group,” Field said.
The only other recipient thus far from Harvard was Economics Professor Susan Athey, who won the award in 2000.
In addition to her post at Harvard, Field is a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a research affiliate of the Bureau for Research in Economic Analysis of Development, and has been a Robert Wood Johnson Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Health Policy.
Other members of the department lauded her accomplishment and creative research.
“Professor Erica Field has impressed not only her colleagues here at Harvard, but the economics profession in general, with her broad interests and innovative research methodology,” said John Y. Campbell, chair of the economics department.
“The faculty in the economics department are delighted that Erica has won this award,” Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw said.
“It reflects her terrific research contributions to date and also her great promise.”

Students had the chance to find out where Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services gets its cranberry produce this past Saturday.
HUHDS’ Food Literacy Project organized a trip to the Ocean Spray cranberry bog, where all of HUHDS’ cranberry-related needs are met. Those include cranberry juice, cranberry sauce, and Ocean Spray’s dried cranberries or “Craisins.”
The Ocean Spray location is one of many such bogs across the country that Ocean Spray describes on its website as “an area of soft, marshy ground, usually near wetlands, where cranberries love to grow.”
This particular bog provides Harvard with 10,000 pounds of cranberries a year, said Pin-Wen Wang ’14, one of the three freshmen FLP representatives on the trip.
Visitors to the bog were struck by its beauty. “It was a sea of red and white and pink berries,” said FLP freshman representative Gary D. J. Gerbrandt ’14.
The event, which was publicized via e-mail lists and on the HUHDS website, proved immensely popular. Over 160 people signed up for only about 50 spots, according to FLP coordinator Dara B. Olmsted ’00.
The trip was the first of many FLP events designed to expose students to the inner workings of HUHDS.
The FLP, predominantly run by students, is intended to educate the Harvard community about food and agriculture.
Olmsted organized Saturday’s outing, but Wang said the event provided a chance to learn how to organize future events on their own.
For the rest of the students, the trip was a way to find out exactly where the sauce accompanying HUHDS’ Thanksgiving meals originates.
The students on the trip had an opportunity not only to see the bog, but also to eat cranberry-based snacks, including chocolate-covered cranberries and cranberry-based stuffing.
Participants also received a crash course in cranberry growing—a year-long process—and harvesting.
The bog tourists were informed that the cranberries sit on a bed of peat moss all year and will be covered in sand over the winter to protect the produce from the elements. During fall, harvesters flood the bog with water, Gerbrandt explained.
“I thought it was really exhilarating,” Gerbrandt said of the trip, “It was really cool to see a giant mass of floating berries, I mean, how often do you get to see that?”

Starting tomorrow, a triangular patch of Harvard Square will be renamed in honor of David L. Halberstam ’55, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and former managing editor of The Crimson.
The area demarcated by Bow, Linden, and Mt. Auburn Streets will be designated Halberstam Square in a ceremony hosted by the City of Cambridge and The Crimson on Wednesday.
Frank H. Duehay ’55, a former Cambridge mayor and classmate of Halberstam, spearheaded the effort to name a spot in Cambridge after Halberstam after former Crimson editor Peter G. Palches ’55 suggested the idea.
“Many people think [Halberstam] was the greatest journalist of his generation, if not of several generations,” Duehay said.
Duehay initially suggested that Plympton Street be renamed in Halberstam’s honor, but upon complaints from current and former residents of Plympton—including Crimson editors, Adams and Quincy House residents, and business owners—he changed his proposal.
The Cambridge City Council approved the measure in December.
In his career as a newspaper reporter and an author of 20 books, most notably the acclaimed “The Best and the Brightest,” Halberstam garnered accolades for his writing on topics ranging from civil rights to professional sports to the Vietnam War.
He died in a car accident in 2007, on his way to an interview for the book he was writing at the time.
“He was incredibly hardworking,” remembered Duehay. “Once he started to take on a project, he would work on it relentlessly.”
Stanley N. Katz ’55, a close friend of Halberstam from the time they met on the first day of their freshman year in 1951, will be one of four speakers at Wednesday’s ceremony.
“He majored in The Crimson when he was an undergrad. He spent 12 hours a day in The Crimson,” Katz recalled of Halberstam, whose diploma indicated that he was a history concentrator. “There were other people in our group who were thought of as more elegant writers...I think it turned out David was the hardest worker in the group.”
The territory that will now be named in the devoted Crimson editor’s honor sits in front of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret social organization that occasionally publishes a so-called humor magazine and boasts a long-standing rivalry with The Crimson.
Though he acknowledged that some Lampoon staff members might be upset by the new name of their front yard, Lampoon writer W. Charlie Schaub ’11 said he was pleased that the area was receiving a name at all.
“It’ll be nice to be able to put a name to this place where a lot of people piss and barf on weekends,” Schaub said.
Wednesday’s ceremony will be followed by a panel discussion with several prominent journalists entitled “In the Spirit of David Halberstam: Investigative Reporting from the Front Lines,” sponsored by the Institute of Politics and Phillips Brooks House.
The Cambridge Public Library, the Harvard Coop, and the Harvard Book Store are displaying Halberstam’s books this week in honor of the event.

At a special meeting held yesterday, the Cambridge City Council expressed concerns about the Cambridge Review Committee’s report on the controversial arrest of Professor Henry Louis “Skip” Gates in July 2009.
The councillors criticized the methodology employed by the 12-person committee of academics and law enforcement personnel and questioned the effectiveness and relevance of the report, which concluded that miscommunication between the parties resulted in Gates’ arrest. The report, released this June, also emphasized the importance of communication between police and community members.
The encounter between Gates and arresting officer Sgt. James Crowley of the Cambridge Police Department sparked a national dialogue over the possible role of racial profiling in the arrest. Some councillors said they were disappointed the report did not investigate the role of race in the arrest.
“I think racism is a sensitive issue but it’s not something we should run away from,” Councillor Leland Cheung said.
Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves said he wanted the committee to recognize that racial profiling employed by police officers was “real.”
“The question that this report does not want to answer... [is] can you get arrested in your house for talking loud?” Reeves said.
“We can’t seem to get an answer.”
Most councillors raised objections about the process by which the report was compiled. According to Reeves, the committee did not consult the council or the public.
Reeves said that the committee meetings, while open to the public, were held during workday hours in hard-to-find places. He also said that the group did not respond to his requests to talk about the report.
Vice Mayor Henrietta J. Davis said that despite its shortcomings, she thought the report acknowledged “a lot of tough lessons,” and that those lessons were being incorporated at the police  department.
“I learned a lot from the report,” Davis said.
Councillors said they were concerned that the report did not present steps to prevent an incident like Gates’ arrest from happening again. They said that while the report presented what Cheung called a “Kumbaya” moment of reconciliation between the police department and the community, it did not recommend substantive steps for improvement.
“What are we going to do next?” Cheung asked. “How do we reconcile differences in [the] account from Crowley and Gates, and how is that going to inform [our] way of policing going forward?”

Some students of Harvard show their appreciation for America by observing (sleeping late on) Columbus Day, others by religiously following Monday Night Football. Residents of Weld Hall, however, express their passion for this country at 9:15 a.m. every Monday with the Pledge of Allegiance.
The practice began last week in Weld 52 with Zachary A. Young ’14 and Thomas J. Gaudett ’14, and expanded to a group of six yesterday. Though Young has only advertised the gathering through the Weld e-mail list, he plans to eventually “start expanding it to other dorms.”
Why stop by Weld to recite an oath that many haven’t heard since middle school? “Why not?” replied Young. “Why is there any reason not to? I’m personally very passionate about my country and I want to reflect that. Why not do it together?”
Though the gatherings haven’t been controversial, Young admitted that he and his suitemates have received “reactions of great indifference.”
If you’d like to take part in the Pledge but can’t make it on Monday mornings, don’t fret. “Hopefully, once we get enough interest,” Young added, “we’ll be able to have it more frequently.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Hillel Board of Directors announced earlier today the retirement of Hillel President and Executive Director Bernard Steinberg, who has led the religious non-profit organization for 18 years.
An e-mail sent to undergraduate members of the Hillel community by Hillel Undergraduate Steering Committee President Nell S. Hawley ’10-’11 explained that Steinberg will be tending to “new projects” that engage individuals in meaningful Jewish discourse.
“My work at Harvard Hillel for nearly two decades has been a labor of love,” Steinberg said in a press release. “It has truly been a joy to collaborate with students, faculty, and alumni to build a mission driven pluralistic community on the Harvard campus.”
At their meeting today. the Board of Directors elected Carl S. Sloane ’58, professor emeritus at Harvard Business School, as the board’s new chairman and Economics Professor Benjamin M. Friedman ’66 as the organization’s new president.
Robert Beal, the former chairman of the Board, praised Steinberg’s “extraordinary” leadership over the years and commended him for turning Harvard Hillel into one of the “largest, most active, and most visible student organizations at Harvard.”
During Steinberg’s tenure, he helped create a new leadership education program to foster interaction between diverse communities within Harvard, according to the press release.
This May, he received the Covenant Award, a prize that celebrates Jewish educators who have impacted Jewish life by taking an innovative approach to education.
“[Steinberg] has been able to connect and guide students, both Jewish and non-Jewish, on campus,” said Hillel Director of Annual Giving and External Relations Rachel Van Emon. “The students will really miss him.”
Steinberg’s administration faced controversy in 2008, when Hillel discovered financial reporting irregularities, according to a letter sent to the organization’s student community by Steinberg and Beal that year.
Harvard Hillel accountant William O’Brien, who was hired by Hillel in 2003 through the financial management contracting agency Insource Services, was charged with larceny, forgery, and false entries in corporate books in connection to the fraud. He pled guilty last month to stealing nearly $780,000 from the religious nonprofit.
Steinberg will serve as acting executive director until Jan. 1, 2011 and remain executive director emeritus from then on. A search committee will begin looking for a new executive director over the course of the year, according to Hawley’s e-mail.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though training for the spring season is just getting underway, the women’s lacrosse team will be stepping up to a hefty challenge Saturday evening when it faces the U.S. women’s national senior team under the lights at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium. Leading the squad will be Jessica Halpern, the team’s top scorer in 2009. After a leave of absence following a season-ending injury last year, J-Halp is back and ready to tackle three-legged mice as well as the rest of the Ivy League. Every week, The Full-Court Press will give you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Jessica Halpern
Year: Senior
 
Stats: After winning Ivy League Rookie of the Year in 2008, Halpern played in all 16 games her sophomore season, leading the Crimson in points (55) and goals (46), six of which came in a season-opening win against Holy Cross. She led the Ivy League in goals per game and points per game that spring.
 
Now, to the questions!
 
1.Typical pre-game meal.
Definitely have got to say that I load up on carbs pre-gametime.  Pasta and bread (with oil and vinegar, of course) are definitely go-tos in the dhall so that I am energized for the game next day.  And no meal ever ends without a bowl of cereal, usually made by my roommate, who makes the best cereal combinations at Harvard. 
 
2. List four songs you listen to before games to get pumped up.
Hmmm...there are so many good ones. I've definitely got to say "Eye of the Tiger"  by Survivor (ritual since freshman soccer season in high school),  "Wavin' Flag" by K'naan , "2012" by Jay Sean,, and "Remember the Name" by Fort Minor. Definitely in that order.
 
3. Favorite team to play against and why? 
Definitely Dartmouth. I know a lot of girls on the team, and each game with them has been a nail-biter to the end in my past three years. Also, it’s an Ivy game...every Ivy game is huge!
 
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room.
There are way too many ridiculous stories that have taken place in our locker room, so I can't say that only one is the best. Capturing a three-legged mouse and making it our team pet has got to be up there, though.
 
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had on the field.
Usually, if I do something embarrassing, I act like nothing happened so that the opponent doesn't realize what happened and so that I can just move on to the next play as soon as possible. I'm not saying that I haven't had plenty of embarrassing moments...I'm just good at hiding them!
 
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why. 
I would say that my style of play is like a panther, because I do a lot of quick movements and quick changes of direction.
 
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a game you were playing in.
I just think it is ridiculous when fans from opposing teams chant things about Harvard in a bashing way. I'm sure they wish they had gone to Harvard. 
 
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
I would definitely play for the basketball team if I could play for another sports team here. Basketball was my favorite sport growing up and originally the sport I wanted to play in college.  Although I decided to play lacrosse in college instead (which I obviously love!), I miss basketball a lot and would kill to be able to play at the college level. 
 
9. Position you would play in Quidditch.
I should probably know this, but I don't know the Quidditch positions! Attack? 
 
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
Ummm gotta say Brady Quinn...and would take him to a Patriots game. I'm sure he'd love that.

If you’re a Harvard student who has seen “The Social Network” since its buzz-worthy release last Friday, chances are you have a bone to pick with the portrayal of Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerberg, the Winklevoss ’04 twins, and other Harvardians in the film. How could you not? It’s personal.
Cue Harvard Professor of Economics and EC10 guru, N. Gregory Mankiw, who wrote in his blog yesterday that although he enjoyed “The Social Network”, he was irked by the fact that “Every Harvard undergrad portrayed in the film was a pompous snob, an annoying social climber, or an antisocial nerd (or some combination of the three).” Those of you who felt misrepresented by “The Social Network” may find a shred of solace in Professor Mankiw’s contention that “Most Harvard undergrads are in fact quite likable. If they were as unpleasant as the film made out, I would have left here long ago.” With 25 years of experience teaching real live Harvard students, Professor Mankiw makes a good argument.
It’s not just Mankiw who felt that the portrayal of Harvard students was one-sided. Harvard alum John Lopez ’03 writes in Vanity Fair that “the only person who’s not an asshole [in “The Social Network”] is Andrew Garfield’s ever-lovable Eduardo L. Saverin ’05.”
Are the complaints of inaccuracy legitimate? Or are we really that bad? It’s ultimately a matter of opinion. Harvard freshman Luis G. Miranda ’14 said that although he perceived the movie to “parody” the many Harvard student stereotypes, he also realized that these stereotypes simply reinforced mainstream’s “preconceived notion of us.” Miranda added that “it was a definitely wake up call” to the enduring strength of these stereotypes in popular view.
