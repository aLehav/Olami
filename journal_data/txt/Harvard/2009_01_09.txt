After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Large-scale levitation may only be possible using smoke and mirrors, but researchers at the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences have measured a repulsive force resulting from quantum fluctuations that could be used to levitate objects on the nanometer scale. 
It is common knowledge that like charges repel and unlike charges attract, but it is less obvious that even charge-neutral objects have fluctuating charges. 
The charges result from shifting electromagnetic fields that are always present, even in a vacuum, said Jeremy N. Munday, one of the study’s authors. 
It was already known that when the two neutral materials are brought into contact, the fluctuating charges can interact and cause an attractive force—the Casimir-Lifshitz force.
However, this was the first study to measure a repulsive force between two charge-neutral objects.
When Munday was a graduate student at SEAS, he set out to measure this repulsive force with V. Adrian Parsegian, a senior investigator at the National Institutes of Health, and Federico Capasso, a professor of applied physics at SEAS. 
“What we did was measure the Casimir-Lifshitz force between a metal and an insulator submerged in a fluid and found that a repulsive force can be obtained between particular materials,” Munday said. 
When he measured the force between a gold sphere and a gold plate in bromobenzene, he found that there was an attractive force, as expected.
“If you have two similar objects, like two dancers following steps, they tend to attract each other,” said Parsegian. “But with two unlike objects there is the possibility that they repel.”  
Indeed, when Munday replaced the gold plate with a silicon dioxide plate, the force became repulsive. 
“This is very exciting,” Munday said. “Now we have shown that we can change this force in a dramatic way—from attractive to repulsive.” 
Capasso said he hopes that these repulsive forces can be used with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). 
“MEMS are gizmos—for example, they can be used in cars to release the airbag,” Capasso said. 
When MEMS are built on the nanometer scale, the Casimir-Lifshitz force becomes dominant and can cause the metallic parts to stick together. 
This is known as “stiction,” and prevents the device from working properly. 
“By learning how to modify this force, it can be incorporated into the design of the devices rather than just being a hindrance,” Munday said. 
If certain properties of the two materials and liquid are chosen appropriately, the liquid will insert itself between the two solids, Capasso said, and this could help reduce stiction.
Munday added that in future experiments they hope to levitate small spherical particles in fluid above a plate, but that the force “cannot be used to levitate trains or frogs or anything like that.”
“This could lead to the development of ultra-low static friction devices and sensors based on engineering these quantum fluctuations,” Munday said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A cross-dressing former Harvard Medical School affiliate serving a life sentence for murdering his wife committed suicide in prison on Monday.
Richard J. Sharpe was found hanging from a bedsheet in his cell in MCI-Norfolk prison, according to Diane Wiffin, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Department of Correction. He had been sentenced to life in prison in 2001 for shooting his wife—and high school sweetheart—Karen Sharpe in 2000 in the foyer of her home while their two young children slept in an adjoining room, according to media reports.
Sharpe and his wife were divorcing at the time and she had obtained a restraining order against him. Sharpe had previously attacked his wife with a fork, Mrs. Sharpe alleged in an affadavit.
While Sharpe had two documented suicide attempts prior to his death, his appellate lawyer, Michael J. Traft, said he was shocked when he heard the news. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Traft said that he suspected foul play.
“I was surprised that he would have committed suicide at this time because he did not indicate that he was despondent,” Traft told The Crimson yesterday. “He had been relatively positive in his communication.”
At the time of Sharpe’s death, Traft had been working on a motion for a new trial and an appeal of the life sentence.
Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Michael Welner, who examined Sharpe in 2003, echoed Traft’s sentiments in a statement released Tuesday.
“[Sharpe] had received actual written threats photocopied on what could have only been Department of Corrections equipment (because of the security of the facility),” Welner said.
“It is my hope that local authorities conduct a careful psychological autopsy to ascertain the possibility of murder versus suicide,” Welner added.
Sharpe’s death is being investigated by the Norfolk district attorney’s office, said David Traub, a spokesman for the Norfolk district attorney. State law dictates that all unattended prison deaths be reviewed.
Sharpe’s trial in 2001 became a media sensation in large part because of the revelation that he was a cross-dresser. The trial was televised by CourtTV and turned into a book (“Twisted: The Secret Desires and Bizarre Double Life of Dr. Richard Sharpe”).
Sharpe, a dermatologist by training, had been affiliated with the Medical School for 15 years, but was let go as a part-time clinical instructor in June 2000 for not fulfilling his duties.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 70 members of the Harvard community gathered last night in a snowy Hillel courtyard for a candlelight vigil mourning the loss of life in the Gaza Strip and Israel since serious conflict began in the region almost two weeks ago. 
The vigil was co-sponsored by the Harvard Islamic Society, Harvard Students for Israel, Harvard Hillel, Jews and Muslims (JAM), the Progressive Jewish Alliance, and the Society of Arab Students.
Shifra B. Mincer ’09 and Sadia Ahsanuddin ’09, both leaders in JAM, read personal reflections.
“It means a lot to see so groups with so many different opinions and ideas come together,” Ahsanuddin said. “Human life is sacred, and we must remind ourselves that the other side is just as human and as vulnerable as we are.”
Mincer read a similar call for peace and mutual understanding. 
“The more we ignore others’ stories, the more the violence,” she said. “We have to listen.” 
She also encouraged attendees to get their news from a source they do not normally read.
“A haze hangs over everything I do,” she added.
A diverse crowd remained subdued but focused for the half-hour-long gathering, despite a brief interruption from two students who stood silently in the back of the crowd holding signs in protest. One read, “Israelis against the War” and the other, “765 Palestinians Dead/10 Israelis.” A brief tussle ensued when another student attempted to knock down the signs.
“They’re just frustrated,” said one vigil participant, who asked not to be named.
After two prayers, translated into both Arabic and Hebrew, Ilan J. Caplan ’10 led the crowd in a Hebrew song.
“Please sing,” he said. “It will warm you up even if you think you can’t sing.”
The vigil ended with a moment of silence. Participants lingered to talk and reflect.
“I think it’s wonderful that we can come together, hoping for peace,” Yonit D. Lavin ’09 said. “It doesn’t mean people don’t have very different opinions, but our ultimate goals for peace are the same.”
“I was deeply bothered by the attacks and the brutal violence,” Alexandra A. Rahman ’12 said. “There is very little a Harvard student can do to help the situation over there politically, but attending the vigil is one of the things we can do.”
Miranda K. Margowsky ’12 said that the vigil was a sign of hope.
“It’s nice to show our support and to bring together both sides of the conflict,” she said. “If we can do it here, maybe it can happen there too.”
