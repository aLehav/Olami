After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Donald Glover’s “Atlanta,” a new T.V. show premiering on FX, is a comedy-drama chronicle of a couple of Atlanta natives’ struggles to break into the music industry. Rich in subtle humor and effective characterization, the show nonetheless falters, as the often tired premise sometimes fails to showcase the talents of the actors and writers.
In the opening scene of the pilot, Earnest “Earn” Marks (played by Donald Glover) and his cousin Paper Boi (played by Brian Tyree Henry) smoke weed and discuss their musical future when an altercation ensues. A gun goes off, and the scene cuts to black. After the opening credits, the scene shifts to Earn in bed with his semi-estranged ex-girlfriend. The raw brutality of the first scene and the subtle emotional interplay of the second reveal two poles of Earn’s life, asking the question that doggedly follows him throughout “Atlanta”: How did I get here?
While “Atlanta” deals with heavy themes, Glover never loses sight of the fact that it is, at its core, a show about a young man adrift. Instead of painting endless scenes of maudlin sorrow and dead-ends, Glover creates a believable—and relatable—portrait of someone who just can’t seem to get it right. When Earn laments, “Is that the way that it works? Are some people just supposed to lose?” his expressionless face and mumbled words give the line meaning without making it melodramatic.
Underneath Earn’s character is a quiet anxiety which fuels his quest to escape underemployment. His predicament is not quite desperate but not quite comfortable either; he himself is not quite deserving of pity but not quite deserving of help. Earn’s attire reflects his awkward footing; at work, he wears a blue suit, an outfit that hides his financial struggles, but otherwise, Earn wears a child-like ensemble of sneakers, backpack and too-small shirt. No longer a child and not yet an adult, Earn is looking to create his own rite of passage. When Earn offers to be his cousin Paper Boi’s manager, saying “let’s get rich,” the grand image he paints is belied by the bleak setting of an abandoned couch in the park. Glover’s use of static shots and immobile cameras creates a claustrophobic mood—one which intensifies Earn’s mission to “make it out.”
Racial themes of opportunity and privilege are teased out through awkward interactions with Earn’s white high school friend, now working a lucrative job in a radio station. These conversations are subtle and well-drawn, lacking the sensationalism that often follows the exploration of such themes. As in “Straight Outta Compton,” the studio is represented as an artistic and racial battleground for these interactions, where black artists compete with predominantly white gatekeepers for control over the raw material of their music. When Earn finally gains entry into this sphere, he does so not with the help of his white high school friend, but rather through the black janitor who works at the studio, an act which highlights the racial barriers to success. Earn’s unorthodox entrance also serves as the physical manifestation of his ingenuity, as well as his desperation. With this characterization, Glover cements Earn’s likability and unpredictability, the twin engines that drive “Atlanta.”
However, no matter how high-octane Earn’s character is, “Atlanta” is hamstrung by its tired premise. While current audiences demand complex black characters, a black twenty-something trying to make it big, especially in the age of “Scandal,” is hardly novel. The characters of “Atlanta,” although interesting and well-drawn, still fall into the archetypal characters of the black musical Odyssey-hustle: the concerned parents who wish their son would grow up, the ex-girlfriend that wants Earn to be a better father to their daughter, and Earn himself, a desperate artist who uses his rent money to bribe a radio station to play his song. Although Donald Glover peppers “Atlanta” with subtle jabs and well-turned phrases, the end result is somewhat bland, a sort of easy-listening drama that fails to deliver either deep commentary or richly portrayed characters. “Atlanta” is ultimately a new-and-improved version of other dramas; its well-polished nonchalance is not so much a revolution as a veneer for the reincarnation of an overdone premise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“In chess, the small one can become the big one,” a young slum girl teaches wide-eyed protagonist Phiona (Madina Nalwanga). It’s a reference to the rule in chess in which a pawn, considered dispensable and weak, can become a queen, the single most dominant piece in the game. The premise of Disney’s latest offering, “Queen of Katwe,” fits this phenomenon to a T through its telling of the remarkable true story of Phiona Mutesi, a Ugandan woman who goes from selling maize in the slums of Katwe, Uganda, to becoming a national chess champion. Though certainly inspiring and remarkable, Phiona’s is a subdued story that, in lesser hands, could have very easily translated as insipid on screen. But phenomenal performances abound, and studied, rapt attention to detail from cast and crew alike allow the film to transcend its clichés and to eschew any trace of banality. “Queen of Katwe” is an exquisitely shot, powerfully acted, and delicately, intelligently directed film that does justice to the inspiring story of its protagonist.
At its core, “Queen of Katwe” is a story told countless times before. The nature of Phiona’s story forces the film into recycling stock characters audiences will recognize all too well—the underdog; the earnest, good-willed coach; the strict mother; and the absentee father, to name a few. Perhaps the film falls into saccharine territory one too many times, but it doesn’t surrender itself to convention. It instead adds substance to otherwise prosaic characters by touching upon real, relevant problems in their lives, such as identity, death, class, inequality, and even, perhaps a bit surprisingly for a family movie, prostitution. The cast’s extraordinary efforts are strong enough to overcome a screenplay that at times feels stilted, and the actors ultimately succeed in bringing their dynamic characters to life. In particular, newcomer Madina Nalwanga, hand-picked by director Mira Nair herself from the slums of Uganda, manages to stand her ground against seasoned actors Lupita Nyong’o and David Oyelowo. In one of the most memorable moments of the film, she licks gruel from the side of a mug—her eyes, somber and expressive, lending an authenticity to her performance that provides the film with a breath of fresh air.
Visually, the film is utterly engrossing. Nair, who has previously worked in Uganda and is married to a Ugandan, is well aware of the setting’s capacity to stun and wastes not one moment in capturing the richness of all the country has to offer. Nair’s vision, realized through Sean Bobbitt’s gorgeous cinematography, captures the beauty in the slums of a rural Africa, a setting so rarely depicted by Hollywood at all. Bright yellows dart across the screen, layered upon burnt oranges and brilliant reds; glassy percussions sound off in the background as the small town of Katwe is suffused with a contagious exuberance. As expertly as Nair captures wider vistas, even more captivating is her fixation on the smallest of details, a sheer delight to watch. She is entirely unafraid to use extreme close-up shots to direct our gaze upon things like crescents of dirt under fingernails and blackened toes. Perhaps most notably, Nair intersperses a mix of close-up and extreme close-up shots throughout the film to bring our attention towards the eyes of the Ugandans—arrestingly shot through with red, swollen vessels, presumably due to stress or infection. The film’s political leaders, privileged schoolboys, and poorest urchins, though they vary widely in outward demeanor, are all equalized through close-up shots of their bloodshot eyes, a muted yet chilling statement on class and identity. Nair goes both big and small as she depicts a Katwe steeped in beauty and authenticity, and her work on both ends is masterful.
It may be easy at this time in the season to gloss over a biopic, especially one that centers on the relatively esoteric topic of chess, but “Queen of Katwe” is an infectiously warm, sincere, visually arresting depiction of a story that deserves to be heard. Through the film’s amalgam of considerable talents of cast and crew alike, Phiona’s true and powerful story has easily and handsomely come to life on the big screen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Thursday, the Harvard Art Museums stayed open late to welcome students back to campus and introduce their new director, Martha Tedeschi. With a night sky visible through Renzo Piano’s glass ceiling and a live band playing, hundreds of students milled in the museum’s central courtyard or filtered through the galleries. In a short speech at the beginning of the evening, Tedeschi spoke of her desire to make the museums an inviting space for students across the university. “There’s no right way or wrong way to use the art museums,” she said. She added that whether students wished simply to sit at at the courtyard cafe tables to study and socialize or to spend a few minutes with a work of art in the galleries, the museums belonged to them.
During the event, students wandered through the galleries in twos and threes, took tours with undergraduate student guides, looked through the offerings of the museums’ Student Print Rental Program, and sampled the Australian food themed to celebrate “Everywhen,” the special exhibition of Australian indigenous art currently on view at the museums. When asked, they gave a variety of reasons for coming to the Student Late Night. Alexandra S. Grimm ’17 climbed to the second floor with a few friends to find a favorite Degas sculpture. Now a senior in Leverett concentrating in English, she recalled her freshman year living in Greenough, when noise from the construction on the neighboring museums would wake her almost every morning. “It felt like a nice full circle to come back here at the beginning of my last year,” Grimm said. Maya Smith ’20 said that she had come mainly for the fun and the snacks. She added that she was undecided about her concentration but did not anticipate studying art or art history. David F. Clifton ’17, a classics concentrator, said that he often comes to the museums to find some quiet in the midst of campus.
According to Erin L. Northington, Manager of Student Engagement Programs at the museums, the Student Late Night continues the institution’s ongoing efforts to attract students from all disciplines and all schools of the University. “Broadly, one of my goals is always to make sure that students know that the museum is a place for them and that they have something to add to the conversations that happen here,” Northington said. “Our work is better and stronger and enriched by [their] questions and ideas and participation with our programs.” Northington, who was the main planner for the event, added that many of the ideas for Thursday’s activities, such as temporary tattoos featuring works from the collection, came from her conversations with students.
The late night at the Harvard Art Museums mirrors broader trends toward more participatory experiences and a greater focus on visitor engagement in art museums across the world in the past few years. Boston’s MFA, for instance, will offer a series of four all-night parties this fall as part of a seasonal program highlighting contemporary art. Northington emphasized, however, that the central focus of the museums remains the collections they house and the research they support. “With all of our programs, with whatever we’re doing, we’re always trying to connect back deeply to an idea, or to an exhibition that’s up, or to a research project from a current curator,” she said. “Even if it is a festive and fun evening, all of our ideas are really grounded in the collection and in the work of the museum.”
In an interview after her speech, Tedeschi emphasized her interest in the museum as an institution focused on teaching. “It’s exciting for me to be here, because what separates this job from my previous job is this intense focus on students and outreach to students,” said Tedeschi, whose appointment to the directorship was announced last March and who previously served as deputy director for art and research at the Art Institute of Chicago. “We have a sincere and abiding interest in the well-being and life of students, and we believe that the museums can be a part of that.”
She added that outreach to students has a variety of meanings, beginning with simply providing a break from day-to-day work. “There should be intriguing, small reasons that bring students to the museums. This is not about adding to their to-do lists,” she said. “There should be some surprise and delight about the experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Marshall Richards arrives at Brattle Square around 11:45 a.m. and sets up his gear in front of Crema Café: a microphone, a small amplifier, a music stand with a tablet displaying sheet music, and an umbrella branded with the words “The Boston Opera Guy.” By noon, he’s launched into his warmup repertoire of French and Italian art songs, accompanied by a piano recording and the urban sounds of patio chatter and traffic. This surreally European scene attracts small crowds for a few minutes at a time during the lunch rush.
Richards, a lyric tenor, performs in Harvard Square on Thursdays to warm up for his lessons with Thomas Jones, the longtime Harvard voice teacher. Most afternoons, though, he can be found in the city, at Boston Common on Mondays and Wednesdays from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. and Copley Square, where he met Jones, on Tuesdays and Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. The Crimson sat down with Richards during a break in his warm-up. A lightly edited transcript appears below.
The Harvard Crimson: How long have you been “The Boston Opera Guy”?
The Boston Opera Guy: I’ve been in Boston since March 15. That’s when I moved to town. Busking is just my way of getting myself out there and “singing for my supper,” so they say…. Before I moved here, I was in New Orleans busking full-time and calling myself the New Orleans Opera Guy. [The name] “The Boston Opera Guy” is a way for people to remember me so they can look me up later online. I can tell people my name, and most people are not going to remember that a few hours later. But if I tell people “The Boston Opera Guy,” then it sticks in their head, and then they go home and they like my Facebook page.
THC: What’s your favorite place in town to perform?
TBOG: I have the biggest crowds at Copley. I’m the most well-received, it seems like. [Attendance at] the park [Boston Common] is growing, especially with me being on the [Boston Lyric Opera’s 40 Days of Opera] calendar, so I’d say at this point, they’re about even. But Copley’s where I met Tom [Jones], and Tom’s been a huge part of helping me get involved in the community here, and he’s introducing me to a lot of different people and preparing me to audition for these places like BLO, and Emmanuel Music, and Handel and Haydn Society and all these great places in Boston and in Cambridge.
THC: Are you planning on performing year-round?
TBOG: Well, I’ve never been through a winter up here. I moved here in March, so I’ve never actually experienced a New England winter. I’m from the south, I’m from Mobile, Alabama, and I’ve lived in New Orleans and I’ve lived in Los Angeles…. I’m really hoping that I’m gonna secure some more professional work by the time winter rolls around in a couple of months, and if not, I’m probably going to have to take to the subways. Subway’s not my favorite place, but you know, it works, and I’ve got the permit and everything.
THC: You’re performing what many see as an old, elite art form in modern, pedestrian places. Do you think of that as a tension?
TBOG: I think it’s really great. Being a street performer’s not what I started out wanting to do. It’s not, like, my ultimate goal. But in a funny way, it’s ended up being exactly what I want to do, just on a smaller scale—which is to broaden the opera audience and to expose people to it that otherwise have never heard it, or may have certain prejudices, like thinking that it’s elitist, or thinking that it’s antiquated or boring. This has been an opportunity for me to change people’s perceptions on a boots-on-the-ground level…. That’s really my main goal as a singer, is to spark an interest in classical music, because I really value it. When you’re an opera singer, you’re not just a singer; you’re, in a way, a historical preservationist. You’re preserving this tradition that’s older than you, and older than your parents, and older than your grandparents. And the reason it’s still around is because it’s still the greatest music that’s ever been made. Nobody’s gonna come along and make Bach or Mozart obsolete.
THC: What kinds of experiences have you had performing in these unconventional spaces?
TBOG: Every day out here is a new adventure. I never know what to expect…. I’ve just been really pleased with the public’s reaction here. Boston and Cambridge have been better to me than any city that I’ve sung in. People are so enthusiastic and responsive here and really enjoy what I do. It’s very fulfilling to sing this kind of music that’s not necessarily popular music and build these crowds…. Just seeing the people who obviously have never listened to opera at all, never thought that they liked it—it’s most fulfilling when those kinds of people tell me they really appreciate it. Because of course when somebody like Tom, who’s a Harvard professor comes up and tells me that I’m singing really well, that’s incredibly flattering, and that’s exciting too. But it’s bringing it to everybody, and seeing everybody take to it, is really fulfilling and really satisfying.

“The Flag,” a documentary by Tyler S. Parker ’17, explores the debate over the Confederate flag in the wake of the Charleston shootings. The short film focuses on the protests, both pro- and anti-flag, that took place in the South Carolina state capitol in the summer of 2015 and that eventually resulted in the flag’s removal. Parker’s documentary won several awards at the Harvard College Film Festival and will also be showing at the Arlington and New Orleans Film Festivals. The Crimson sat down with Parker to discuss his work.
The Harvard Crimson: Where did you find the inspiration for “The Flag”?
Tyler S. Parker: I went to South Carolina [in the summer of 2015] to work for the Hillary Clinton campaign, and while I was there, there were the shootings at the Emmanuel AME Church. I’m a pretty strong Christian, and I’ve been to lots of black churches back home, and that was something that really moved me. The grace that the family showed to the killer was really powerful. I kept watching that situation in case there was an opportunity for a documentary. A couple of weeks later, one of the state senators, Clementa Pinckney, [who was murdered in the shooting] was lying in state in the state capitol building, and there was a Confederate flag that was flying outside. All the flags in the state capitol were half-staff except the Confederate flag. A lot of people were outraged. My office was two blocks from the the front of the state capitol building, so when I could get free time from the campaign I grabbed my camera and did as much recording as I could. “The Flag” turned out to be a really fascinating piece of work about people arguing with each other outside the state capitol building. “Democracy at its rawest” is how I describe the film.
THC: You titled the documentary “The Flag” as if it’s a taboo thing that is both instantly recognizable but impossible to talk about directly. And of course, there’s a big conversation on campus about symbols, such as the names on Harvard buildings and the vandalized images at the Harvard Law School. When you created this documentary, which is at its heart about symbols, what were you hoping to explore—either through the flag or about the flag?
TSP: The topic of racist iconography is inevitably there, and it was really interesting to go into the South and watch a lot of people celebrate the fall of the Confederate flag, but people outside of South Carolina—especially people here at Harvard who may come from places like California or the Northeast—[were] confused about why this was even a question. I also think that there is a real distance between the experiences of a lot of African-Americans and other people of color who live in places of entrenched racism like the South, or people who may be used to less overt forms of racism such as microaggressions or systemic racism. [For example,] I have family that live in Stone Mountain, Georgia. The mountain that is called Stone Mountain has a big Mount Rushmore-style murals [of] Confederate generals. There are many issues that black people in the South have learned to tolerate, whereas African-Americans in the North are not used to these experiences. Ultimately, the fight to have the Confederate flag removed has been a tremendously uphill battle, and I think that if the shootings hadn’t happened the way they did with a white supremacist responsible, we would still be seeing the Confederate flag in South Carolina’s state capitol.
THC: In this documentary you make sure to use very close personal shots, zooming in on the faces of protesters from both sides. What was the purpose of this technique, and what are some other artistic choices that you made to get your message across?
TSP: When I first started filming, I thought I could make a film that was a really straightforward “take down the flag” film. But then I wanted to make something more journalistic and even-handed. There’s a scene in a film there’s a girl who’s crying because one of the anti-flag protesters called her a pig, and that happened on the first day I shot, and it was something that stuck in my mind during the entire process of shooting. I wanted to capture more of that emotion because I think that in difficult conversations it’s so easy to forget that every human being, no matter what side of the issue they are on, has a story, and has reasons that, if not objectively reasonable, are subjectively reasonable [and] are informed by their life experiences, by the opinions and stories that they have been told. I was really conscious to make sure to allot both sides equal amounts of time in the film. I really tried to focus on close-ups because there is something about seeing someone’s eyes as they are giving an impassioned speech that can tell you more about what they are saying than their words. I also didn’t want to use music. I really wanted to use the sounds of the space that I was shooting in, since the story and people’s reactions are enough to create a world. I wanted the people in the film to tell the story and to take myself out of it as much as possible.
THC: Do you think that we as a country need to work toward racial equality? Or do you think that the time for a national conversation is over and that we need to abandon the debate in order to begin tangible work on this issue?
TSP: Nikki Haley [governor of South Carolina] came and gave a speech at Harvard saying that after the shootings people came together and had conversation peacefully, and eventually came to the conclusion to take the flag down. There are two opposing world views about how to solve social problems in United States: One is to do something; the other is to have a conversation and convince people that something needs to be done. At the end of the day, all that matters is that something was done about the flag. I think that [in many historical cases] people were doing stuff, and then hearts and minds will follow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the shadowed, concrete exhibition space on the ground level of the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts hangs a series of artworks as diverse in style as they are in medium. The gallery, which hosts a variety of student and faculty showings throughout the year, currently houses selected works by six visiting faculty members in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies: Lucas Blalock, Jennifer Bornstein, Paul Bush, Dru Donovan, Alexander Galloway, and Kianja Strobert.
This exhibition marks another iteration of a decades-long tradition, in which the VES Department invites practicing artists and scholars each year to join its teaching staff. This year, the visiting faculty lead a wide range of courses, from Donovan’s Introduction to Still Photography to Bornstein’s Sensory Ethnography. The diverse course offerings reflect the varied backgrounds of the visitors themselves: Blalock works extensively with layered photographs and Photoshop; Bornstein investigates multiple mediums including video, etching, and 16-millimeter film; Bush specializes in shorter-length stop frame animation. The exhibition gallery itself includes video installations playing alongside photo collages, rubbings, and acrylic paintings.
Also wide-ranging are the ideas the visiting faculty members seek to explore. Some of the works on display, like Donovan’s series of photographs from her “Carving the Lung” collection, carry a deliberate thematic focus. Figures in the photographs adopt various poses that convey a sense of performance. “I’m interested in the construction of identity, and the performance of one’s identity,” Donovan says of her work.
Other artists choose to keep quiet about the intentions behind the works on display. Bornstein, a former Radcliffe fellow and recipient of the Institute of Contemporary Art’s 2017 Foster Prize, falls into this category. In a video originally broadcast on cable TV, a 1990s-era Bornstein takes viewers through random memorabilia—cups, straws, napkins. Another piece features her blue encaustic and wax rubbings of equipment from the Film Study Center at Harvard. What does Bornstein hope viewers walk away thinking? The answer doesn’t seem to be definitive. “I hope people bring their own interpretations to the works,” she says.
While some visiting faculty members come from a traditional academic background, the majority, like Donovan and Bornstein, are studio faculty. Artistic practice, rather than instruction, stands at the center of most visitors’ careers. “[Harvard] has hired me to be exactly myself, to teach what I want to teach and to bring my own engagement to the class. That’s where I feel like that kind of teaching really intersects with my own work. I feel like I can bring in exactly what I’m thinking about in my own work right now, or just what I’m thinking about,” Donovan says.
Visiting faculty members cite the opportunity to work with other faculty members as another major draw of the program. “It’s wonderful, because [my colleagues] are wonderful artists whom I respect,” Bornstein says. “It’s wonderful to always be in conversation with them both personally and professionally.”
Donovan also stresses the importance of the VES community for nurturing artistic growth. “I like seeing how being in a conversation with my students informs and impacts my own work,” she says.
Organizers have taken care to make further avenues of research available to those whose curiosities are piqued by the exhibition. The bookstore located on third floor of the center, for instance, has just stocked up on Bornstein’s monograph and a magazine with Strobert’s work.
The Visiting Faculty Art Exhibition is jointly presented by the CCVA and Harvard’s VES Department. The exhibition will be on view at the CCVA through Oct. 1, 2016.

UPDATED: Sept. 13, 2016, at 2:58 p.m.
Harvard University Dining Services workers are considering a strike if the University does not comply with their demands for an increased minimum salary and more affordable healthcare. Under the current healthcare plan, HUDS workers have a high deductible, but their co-pays are low enough that they often do not hit the deductible. HUDS workers pay $40 for emergency room medical care, and $15 or less for nearly every service.
Under Harvard’s new proposal, these co-pays would increase dramatically; an emergency room visit would rise from $40 to $100, and inpatient hospital services and outpatient surgeries would spike from no cost at all to $100. As a tradeoff, the University would eliminate deductibles. For workers who earn less than $35,000 a year without overtime pay, however, increased co-pays represent significant burdens. Therefore, HUDS employees and representatives from its union, Local 26, are calling for a $35,000 minimum salary for employees who work year-round and more affordable health benefits. Although the current benefits compare well with those offered by other private sector and food service employers, Harvard has the responsibility to lead on fair treatment for its lowest-paid employees.
Employees at HUDS work a taxing job for extended hours, and only earn on average $21.89 per hour. Since their work aligns with the academic calendar, they all do not work over school recesses, and often struggle to earn a living wage. In order to support their families, many are forced to find temporary work during January term or the summer. Given these circumstances, the changes that Harvard is proposing to their healthcare plan are neither moral nor sustainable.
It is unreasonable for Harvard to undervalue its employees in this manner, especially since HUDS workers play a critical role in building community among students on campus. In particular, the demographics of HUDS workers make students of color feel more welcome on campus. On a campus where members of the faculty and administration often do not reflect student diversity, students of color may feel more comfortable relating to the HUDS staff.
Therefore, HUDS workers’ contribution to Harvard goes beyond feeding hundreds of students, cleaning up after them, and maintaining order in the dining hall. They also help build and fortify the community and offer support to students. Harvard needs to recognize the important role—one that is not fungible—that HUDS workers play on campus, and compensate them accordingly.
We hope that Harvard and the HUDS workers can reach an agreement before Sept. 17, the expiration date of the union's contract with Harvard. Nevertheless, we will support HUDS and whatever course of action they pursue in this negotiation process. HUDS workers should not have to accept drastic cuts to their healthcare, or feel compelled to work overtime in order to earn a living wage. Therefore, we will support HUDS workers in a strike if Harvard does not make reasonable concessions.
If the HUDS workers are forced to strike, Harvard must ensure that all students are still well-fed. It goes without saying this responsibility entails some sort of satisfactory contingency plan, which is especially important for low-income students who would be particularly burdened by out-of-pocket expenses.
Nevertheless, we are rooting for a denouement before Sept. 17. Harvard would be considerably hamstrung without HUDS workers for any period of time, but if the workers are forced to strike as a last resort, we understand their decision.

CLARIFICATION: Sept. 13, 2016The editorial was updated to clarify the fact that Harvard's healthcare proposal for Local 26 would eliminate deductibles in exchange for higher co-pays.

Regardless of where you came from or where you are going, the first thing you learn at Harvard University is that you don’t know anything.
Was this something you expected to read in The Crimson this early in the year? No. Probably not. But this is the only information you’ll really need, both here and in life. At the very least, it’s the most important thing I’ve learned.
Freshmen, transfers, everyone: I’m a first-year law student. I’m new here, too. And like you, I just learned that I don’t know anything. Again.
Let’s be clear here—I feel adrift not because I'm doing badly or don’t belong. Just like in college, at HLS you learn pretty quickly that you do, in fact, belong. Everybody else is smart, but hey, you’re smart too, and even if you ask a dumb question in your first class, it rapidly becomes clear that everybody else makes mistakes from time to time.
No, it’s just that change is hard, and comfort zones are fun precisely because they are comforting. You can do all the research you want and interview all the lawyers you know, but life is full of second-guessing nevertheless, because everything seems easy when you’re sketching out your life on paper. There’s nothing like rolling up your J. Crew sleeves and actually doing something—going to Harvard included—to make you question your life decisions.
In the last two weeks, I’ve found myself asking questions I thought I’d answered a long time ago, like “Why do I want to be a lawyer?” and “Why did I want to come back to Massachusetts?” Wasn't there plenty that I ardently disliked about New England when I left? Black ice? Sneezing constantly in the spring? Patriots fans?  We know the Patriots will be good and that the winter streets will make me slip. And yes, I do know why I want to be a lawyer, and I'm still confident that my reasons remain true. But as for me, Harvard leaves me uneasy, as any great school should. I'm worried. For the first time in four years, I'm not sure where I stand, how I can succeed, whether I'm even good or bad at all. Everything is in flux. As it should be.
Harvard is a positively terrifying thing to second-guess. As much as I dislike the idea of dreaming of Harvard “because it’s Harvard,” its unquestioned reputation makes it all the more unsettling when you start questioning it—as everybody who comes here inevitably does.
I did the whole “Harvard is amazing” thing too as a kid. Being a Chinese-American of reasonable means, the traditional pilgrimage to Cambridge was never even a question. I don't actually remember it, but as I write, I am wearing a Harvard hat that my parents presumably bought at the Coop more than 15 years ago. It would be cute if it weren’t so weird.
Ironically, I never ended up applying to the College. The problem was, my parents had taken toddler Winston to other universities too. Sitting on Stanford's front lawn one glorious California day, five-year-old Winston blithely informed my mother that I was going to go to school there. I spent the next 12 years working my tail off to make good on that promise, which is a lesson to all of you freshmen that you should never make vows you might not be able to keep. And despite all of that, I ended up here anyway.
But this time, I knew that I was coming here to do something new, to try something bold and exciting. I wasn’t going here because it was the expected thing to do. I wasn’t going here “because it’s Harvard.” This time around, part of the fun was not knowing exactly where I’d end up.
Some of the people that come to Harvard have never failed in their lives, never encountered a true academic difficulty, never not been the smartest person in the room. For those, this university teaches you that you still have so much you need to do. Luckily, it also teaches everyone  that there is so much we can do.  A great school teaches you to be comfortable with not knowing and confident in who you are—and it promises that things do in fact get better, if you’re willing to work at it. That’s why I’m not even that worried right now. It’s because I’ve been here before. And I know everybody here will do just fine.
So let me introduce myself properly this time around. My name is Winston Shi. I am a law student, and as another HLS first-year returning to Massachusetts from NorCal wrote many years ago, there are many moments when I am simply a mess. And that’s OK. "We are lost and we don't know which way we should go,” one of our old artists in residence once said. “But this is a very natural thing, a very healthy thing."
Once again, I meet the darkly glorious mixture of terror and excitement and awe that I felt the first day I arrived at Stanford, when I realized that I didn't know anything at all. I like that feeling. By now it’s second nature to me. It's why I've always sought to get out of my comfort zone, why I love traveling to places I've never seen, why I wanted to come here at all. I'm lost, and it's the best damn feeling in the world.

Winston Shi is a current first-year at Harvard Law School. His column appears on alternate Tuesdays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Faust has recently suggested that those who oppose the new policy on Final Clubs are motivated by resistance to “change” and to “inclusion.” We are four of the professors offering a motion before the Faculty of Arts and Sciences to prohibit discrimination against students on the basis of their organizational memberships. To be clear: None of us is defending the final clubs, nor do we fear change or inclusion. But ends do not always justify means, and the new policy is deeply objectionable, on both substantive and procedural grounds.
Citing the Sexual Assault Task Force Report, the policy claims to “address deeply rooted gender attitudes, and the related issues of sexual misconduct.” The report rests its case against the final clubs on a statistic: Seniors who “participated” in final club activities are more likely than seniors in general to have experienced sexual assault. Of course, this correlation does not imply that clubs cause sexual assaults. It suggests only that students who have attended a final club party (the report’s definition of “participation”) are more likely than their non-“participating” peers to experience sexual assault somewhere, sometime. The new policy is not the obvious response to this unsurprising finding—and indeed, is not among the report’s specific recommendations. Reducing sexual assaults on campus—and especially in the Houses, where most take place—requires thoughtful discussion and hard work. The policy encourages neither, and is less likely to reduce sexual assault than to cultivate the illusion of decisive action.
Moreover, the policy sweeps all single-gender social organizations into the same basket—fraternities and sororities, clubs that host parties, and those that bar non-members from their premises. Yet it does not apply to recognized de facto single-gender organizations and, according to one report, may not apply to final clubs either if they remain single-gender but cynically tweak their bylaws.
A related concern is that unenforced policies sow disdain for all rules. Yet any effective enforcement mechanism for this new policy would require students to inform on their peers—encouraging exactly the sort of poisonous conduct that we sought to avoid when implementing the Honor Code.
Some have suggested that everything else has been tried, and Harvard has to do something about final clubs. But we are not aware of any aggressive educational campaign about the dangers of the clubs. Nor does the College call in the police when final club parties disturb the peace, since it has been reluctant to encourage the arrest of its own students. Such alternatives should be considered before we make rules that infringe basic civil liberties.
Neither the FAS nor any of its committees (including the Committee on Student Life) considered this policy—or debated alternatives—before it was announced. What does it say about Faculty governance of the College that it was given no opportunity to discuss a policy that materially affects thousands of undergraduates?
---
Most troubling to some of us is the policy’s rationale, which threatens freedom of association and of thought. “Discrimination is pernicious,” begins the syllogism; single gender clubs are discriminatory; therefore, anyone who belongs to such a club does not “advance our core institutional values.” Consequently, Harvard should deny those students certain privileges.
That is, Harvard would have a values test. The president and the dean have identified certain values which Rhodes and Marshall nominees, team captains, and student leaders are expected to “advance” in their private lives, not merely to observe on campus. Membership in a noncompliant organization is considered sufficient proxy for failure to “advance” these values.
Perhaps not since the Puritan era has Harvard assumed such a posture of authority over the beliefs and associations of its students. In modern times, the faculty has instead voted rules of behavior and sanctions for violating them, not rules of thought and tests for determining commitment to Harvard’s “values.”
Where would this train of logic lead? How many other associations to which students belong might be judged, with equal or greater plausibility, to be hostile to Harvard’s “values of non-discrimination”? What of the undergraduate who joins a lobbying organization that opposes gay marriage or one that combats affirmative action programs in higher education?  Is membership in the Republican Party less an affront to “our deepest values” than membership of the Fly? How about the Daughters of the American Revolution—or the Roman Catholic Church?
We are not the first to notice the alarming implications of the new policy. Students have already asked us if they should hide their religious and political affinities if they hope someday to receive Harvard’s support. How can they be confident that a fellowship nominating committee will not hold their religious or political convictions against them, if these might run afoul of Harvard’s “values”?
The new policy would likewise set the stage for new forms of political litigation on campus. Right to Life groups would claim that students working for Planned Parenthood promote discrimination against the unborn, while pro-choice advocates would insist that pro-life organizations champion discrimination against women. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli students would swap claims of ties to groups practicing ethnic discrimination.
And why should faculty be held to a lower standard than students? Academic freedom is well and good, the argument would go, but when we decide whose research to support or whom to appoint as dean or department chair, shouldn’t Harvard’s fundamental values count at least as much as they do when the presidency of the Chess Club is at stake? Why should faculty seeking advancement get away with connections to organizations that are judged to be hostile to “our values”?
When ROTC was barred from campus for its discriminatory policies, the Verba Committee considered and rejected sanctions against students who chose to become cadets. “Harvard is not and should not be responsible for the policies and practices of the wide variety of external organizations in which its students may choose to participate,” the report read. “[I]ntrusion by the University into the private choices of students, acting as individuals, to … participate in such external activities would, we believe, be unacceptably paternalistic.” A wise principle, which then went without saying formally. Evidently it needs saying today, and our motion says it.

“Cecilia had a very even temperament, but she had a strong personality,” writes Paul W. Hodge ’60, a former student of the famed astronomer and astrophysicist Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, in an email. “I never heard her utter an angry word. She met difficulties with first silence and then with well-worded suggestions for solution.”
Although “famed astronomer and astrophysicist” may sound like a hefty accomplishment in itself, it proves to be only one of a long list of successes for Harvard’s first female professor.
Payne-Gaposchkin wrote what fellow astronomers Otto Struve and Velta Zeberge called “the most brilliant Ph.D thesis ever written in Astronomy.” She became the first person to receive a Ph.D. in astronomy at Radcliffe College. Finally, she was promoted as the first woman to receive a full-time, non-female-only professorship from Harvard College.
Payne-Gaposchkin began her academic career in the botany department at Newnham College, Cambridge University. It was only after a lecture given by Arthur S. Eddington, an astronomer Payne-Gaposchkin grew to deeply admire, that she realized she had a passion for astronomy and physics.
Excited by the young woman’s curiosity, Eddington later offered her access to Cambridge University’s Observatory Library. As Payne-Gaposchkin noted in her autobiography “The Dyer’s Hand,” in that moment she felt as if “he had opened the doors of the heavens….”
Upon completing her coursework at Newnham, Payne-Gaposchkin realized the only positions she would be able to find in the UK were low-paying teaching jobs. Determined to pursue higher education and continue her research, Payne-Gaposchkin traveled to the U.S.
Funding her trip with various scholarships and fellowships (including the Harvard College Observatory Fellowship), Payne-Gaposchkin moved to Harvard College to work under Harlowe Shapely, who encouraged her to write a dissertation. Notably, that dissertation established hydrogen as the primary component in stars and effectively the most abundant element on the planet. In 1925, she received her Ph.D.
Despite these auspicious beginnings, Payne-Gaposchkin spent the next decade at a standstill. She spent over 10 years working as Shapely’s technical assistant before earning the title of “Astronomer” in 1938—a lengthy wait for the author of “the most brilliant Ph.D. thesis ever written in Astronomy.”
Yet the wait wasn’t quite over for Payne-Gaposchkin. Despite teaching numerous courses for the college, none of her courses were recorded in Harvard’s catalogue until 1945. Furthermore, she wasn’t given the title of a full-time professor until 1956, 31 years after the publication of her thesis.
Even then, Payne-Gaposchkin was undeterred. Not long after gaining professorship, she was promoted to head of the Astronomy Department—becoming the first woman to chair a department at Harvard College.
“When she set herself to a task, she was indefatigable. Her powers of concentration were so great that she could work for hours without stopping,” Payne-Gaposchkin’s daughter, Kathy Haramundanis, said in an interview with the American Institution of Physics. “She could sustain this level of activity for long intervals, days or even weeks at a time.”
Her passions weren’t bound by the confines of astronomy or physics, either. Many remember her for “her elegant and fluent use of language. Everything she said could have been written down, but it was all extemporaneous,” Hodge wrote.
In her introduction to Payne-Gaposchkin’s autobiography, former colleague Jesse L. Greenstein described Payne-Gaposchkin as “quite an extraordinary figure; broadly informed in astronomy…and widely read in current English and American literature and Classical music.”
Aside from devoting her life to a career in academia, Payne was also a mother of three, a rare combination at the time. “Some [people] thought she shouldn’t be doing that, the women, in particular,” Haramundanis remembered in her AIP interview. “The mother of one of my friends might say, ‘The reason you kids have problems is because your mother works.’”
Despite criticism, Payne managed to maintain her status in her field while cooking dinner every night for her children and teaching at a local Sunday school. She passed away in 1979.
Now, just 60 years since Payne-Gaposchkin assumed her full-time professorship, walking into a Harvard classroom and seeing a woman standing at the podium is no rare occurance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Longtime Harvard Square restaurant FiRE+iCE has extinguished its flame, closing its doors for the last time on Sunday after nearly 20 years in business.
The restaurant, known for its improvised dining experience in which patrons craft their own meals with the help of a large Mongolian grill, has been a popular fixture in the Square since its opening in 1997.  In 2010, FiRE+iCE opened a nightclub above the restaurant and began hosting weekly events including Friday night Latin Dance for individuals 21 and over.
FiRE+iCE joins a growing list of businesses in Harvard Square that have shut their doors in the last few months, including O Sushi and Uno Pizzeria and Grill.
The eatery's owner John Schall—who also owns El Jefe’s Taqueria, which opened in October 2015—said he decided to close the restaurant after feeling the location had “run its course.”
After hearing an NPR segment featuring acclaimed television writer and producer Norman Lear, who produced several successful 1970s sitcoms, including All in the Family, Sanford and Son, and The Jeffersons, Schall said it became clear that it was time to close one chapter in order to seek success as prescribed by Lear.
Lear told NPR that people "don't pay enough attention" to the concepts of “over” and “next” in their endeavors.
“For one [of the things] I was doing, it was time for it to be ‘over.’ It was time to go on to what is ‘next,’” Schall said. “For me, El Jefe’s Taqueria is ‘next.’ I’m hoping to build that, and hopefully maybe do some other [restaurants] too.”
The FiRE+iCE chain has another local location in Back Bay, which is owned by the corporate FiRE+iCE group. According to Schall, the closure of the Harvard Square location also reflects a consolidation of the two restaurants.
“We have always been a destination location. We have never been a neighborhood restaurant,” Schall said. “The people who were coming to the FiRE+iCE in Harvard Square will largely be going to the Back Bay location.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 20 percent of freshmen began the school year with $1,000 “startup” grants from the Financial Aid Office as part of a three-year pilot program, according to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67.
Fitzsimmons said all current freshmen from families with incomes of $65,000 or less have received the grants, which he said he hopes will give students the freedom to pursue extracurricular activities, unpaid internships, and summer opportunities that they may not otherwise be able to afford.
Eligible freshmen received $1,000 at the start of the fall semester and will collect another $1,000 in the spring.
“Not only does it give you financial freedom, but it also gives you some psychological freedom,” Fitzsimmons said. “I think in a lot of ways it helps to level the playing field between students from my kind of background, who have no money coming into here, and students from middle income families and above.”
The grants are funded by a $25 million donation, announced this summer, from Timothy R. Barakett ’87 and his wife Michele Barakett to bolster the College’s financial aid and varsity hockey program.
Barakett, a first-generation college student and recipient of financial aid while at Harvard, currently serves as co-chairman of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences portion of Harvard’s record-breaking capital campaign, which has amassed more than $7 billion since its launch in September 2013. He also chairs the campaign's financial aid initiative.
As of Sept. 1, Harvard has raised $460 million towards undergraduate financial aid but remains $140 million short of the FAS goal. Last August, the financial aid priority had raised $386 million out of the $600 million goal.
Fitzsimmons emphasized that financial aid is a “key component of the capital campaign, the largest component for FAS,” and added that alumni generally have had a “very positive reaction” to the startup grants.
“There’s been a lot of interest expressed by alumni and alumnae for the startup grants, a lot of praise for Tim Barakett’s thoughtfulness and generosity in doing this,” Fitzsimmons said.
Sophie T. Carroll ’17, a student coordinator for the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, said some freshmen who received the grant have told HFAI coordinators they have felt “encouraged.”
“I think more than anything, it was just a show of support from Harvard and from the Financial Aid Office in particular that demonstrated to them that Harvard really means what it says,” Carroll said.
According to The Crimson’s annual survey of the freshman class, roughly 57 percent of surveyed freshmen reported receiving some sort of financial aid, and of those 14.5 percent reported coming from homes with family incomes below $40,000. In addition, 15.8 percent of the surveyed freshman class reported being first-generation college students.
The startup grants will be available to the classes of 2021 and 2022 as part of the three-year pilot program. Administrators will later evaluate the program to determine whether it will continue.

UPDATED: Sept. 21, 2016, at 12:18 p.m.
Charles Chen Yidan, co-founder of one of China’s most popular Internet service portals, Tencent, visited Harvard last Thursday to raise awareness about a new educational prize he founded.
The Yidan Prize is the "largest of its kind in monetary terms," according to a press release from the Yidan Prize Foundation, which governs the award. It has an endowment of $320 million, and sponsors two separate prizes which both come with a roughly $3.8 million award. The two prizes are awarded on the basis of research or original ideas that engage with important issues in education development.
Candidates for the prize are nominated by thought leaders and groups such as governmental organizations and professional associations, according to the release. Independent judging panels will then select the winners contingent on the approval and endorsement of the foundation's board of directors.
On Thursday, Chen met with members of the Graduate School of Education faculty to discuss pressing issues in education reform and to seek recommendations for nominees, according to Soo Sheung Wong, associate director of major gifts at the Graduate School of Education.
Thomas Kane, a professor at the Graduate School of Education who attended the meeting, said he believes the Yidan Prize could potentially have a unique impact on education given its independent status and focus on big ideas.
“Prizes, such as the Nobel Prize and the MacArthur Fellowship, achieve their impact not by ‘incentivizing’ effort per se, but by ennobling and inspiring great achievement,” Kane wrote in an email. “I believe the Yidan Prize will do the same in the field of education.”
Chen also met with University President Drew G. Faust Thursday to discuss how the prize works, as well as to exchange views on education reform.
Chen’s visit to Harvard was part of a worldwide tour that aims to raise awareness about the prize.  Chen said he also hopes that this tour can help motivate not just educators, but every person, to talk about education.
The nomination process for the Yidan Prize is open until the end of March 2017, and winners will be announced in September 2017.

Despite ongoing construction, Memorial Church’s programming has continued largely unhindered as Church staff get creative with where they host events.
According to the Memorial Church website, the current construction focuses on functionality rather than appearance. The renovation centers around accessibility and safety upgrades, a remodeled lower level, and a climate control system.
Sunday services are being held in the Knafel Center, formerly known as Radcliffe Gym, and morning prayers have been relocated to Holden Chapel.
“I think attendance [at Church programs] has stayed about the same,” Benjamin J. Schafer ’19, an involved member of the Church, said. “Although we are not in the sanctuary on Sundays, we’re still very much the Memorial Church.”
The Knafel Center, which accommodates several hundred people, has been equipped with chairs and even a small organ. “It’s just wonderful in terms of an intimate space for worship,” said Memorial Church Senior Minister Lucy A. Forster-Smith.
Groups that have traditionally used Memorial Church as a large event venue have also had to relocate their activities. In addition to providing religious services, Memorial Church also served as a musical hub. Edward E. Jones, the Gund University Organist and Choirmaster of Memorial Church, said church choir rehearsals have been moved to Paine Hall.
Unable to access the large organ in Memorial Church, organ students now must play on alternative instruments. The small electric organ in use during services in the Knafel Center, which Jones called a “makeshift” organ, must be manually assembled before each service.
Furthermore, the Church has historically hosted the Harvard Foundation's Harvard Humanitarian Award ceremony. According to the Harvard Foundation, this year’s ceremony will be relocated to the Science Center due to the construction.
“Memorial Church is an iconic feature of the campus so there is always demand for this space. Fortunately, the University has many tremendous venues and during the renovation the Events Management office is working with event sponsors to find alternative spaces,” Brigid O’Rourke, a University spokesperson, wrote in an email.

The Cambridge City Council passed resolutions to lower speed limits throughout the city and investigate the Harvard Square Conservation District during an ambitious and lengthy session Monday, following a month-long break.
An approved policy order with the potential to affect residents lowered speed limits in the City of Cambridge. The City Council voted to lower the speed limits in residential areas from 25 mph to 20 mph and also to decrease the speed limit from 30 mph to 25 mph in “office and business zones.”
“The science behind the importance of lower speed limits is well documented,” City Councillor Leland Cheung said. “I think this is something we should move on quickly.”
The resolution follows recent legislation—entitled the Municipal Modernization Law—passed by the Massachusetts State Legislature and signed by Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 in early August, which updates multiple state laws regarding the role of city governments in citizens' lives. One of those updates enabled municipalities to lower speed limits to 20-25 mph in designated “safe zones.”
The resolution will now move to the City Manager’s Office to begin the process of implementation.
In the wake of recent closures of Harvard Square businesses, and current debates surrounding the Harvard Square Out of Town News kiosk, and Equity One’s proposal to renovate the building that houses the iconic Curious George store, the Council also passed a resolution aiming to investigate the current state of the Harvard Square Conservation District and potentially change zoning regulations. The district has not been officially investigated since 2005.
At last week’s hearing public hearing before the city, Executive Director of the Cambridge Historical Commission Charles Sullivan stressed that the board could not regulate “use” of buildings in Harvard Square before the resolution. Changing zoning regulations, which are overseen by the City Council, would potentially give the body more power over changes in the Square.
The resolution argued that the current developments in the Square are concerning to the City Council and that new regulations may be necessary.
“Harvard Square is again facing intense development pressure as sharply rising rents and property values continue to displace commercial tenants, erode the vitality and diversity of the neighborhood’s retail activity, and threaten its historic character and unique sense of place,” the resolution reads.
Another resolution focused on homelessness in the city. The Council advised City Manager Richard C. Rossi to investigate the feasibility of implementing an employment program for homeless individuals in the city, or increasing the likelihood that homeless individuals are selected for Cambridge’s current nine-week temporary jobs program. Those selected for the program would help to beautify the city while receiving pay and work experience. The resolution cites a program in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as inspiration for the project.
Councillor Nadeem A. Mazen, one of the four sponsors of the resolution, said this program could help homeless people find permanent work.
“From the obvious perspective there are huge barriers to entry in the job market, especially the tech-based job market in Cambridge. It’s hard if you have everything together,” Mazen said.
Further legislation passed by the Council centered around health inspections in restaurants and public knowledge of those grades. The resolution mirrors a similar piece of legislation passed by the Boston City Council in August, which requires restaurants to visibly post their health inspection scores on a shop window. Other major cities like New York and Los Angeles have similar systems.
“Each restaurant will start with 100 points, with points being deducted on a scale for each violation based on the severity of the violation,” the resolution reads.
The resolution will now head to the Committee on Health and Environment Committee for further discussion.
The City Council also made statements on various current state and national issues. In three separate resolutions the Council urged citizens to boycott Wendy’s for not signing onto the Coalition of Immokalee Worker’s Fair Food Program, went on the record supporting “the diversity of perspectives” on physician assisted suicide in terminally ill adults, and condemned “hateful, racist rhetoric” perpetrated against Muslims in the current election season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The all-male Fly Club has hired a group of lawyers in an effort to explore its options in defying Harvard sanctions that are set to penalize unrecognized single-gender social groups. The legal team, with Cambridge attorney Harvey A. Silverglate the most prominent among them, has a long history of advising Harvard undergraduates who face disciplinary action from the College.
The club hired both Silverglate, a civil rights attorney, and Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP, a Boston law firm with deep ties to Silverglate, according to an emailed statement from Fly graduate president Richard T. Porteus Jr. ’78. 
In a brief phone interview Monday, Silverglate said that as of yet he had “no idea” whether the Fly would file suit against the University.
Since Harvard’s spring announcement of historic sanctions, which will bar student members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from campus leadership positions and endorsement for top fellowships starting with the Class of 2021, clubs have busily weighed their responses, though few have been public about their deliberations. The Fly’s announcement marks the first public signal that the University’s policy could face a court challenge, though legal experts are split on the viability of a potential suit. Any lawsuit, according to the experts, would likely rest on Massachusetts’s unique state laws. Though Harvard’s status as a private institution gives it some leeway in placing certain limitations on student behavior, Massachusetts law, in turn, places certain limits on what a private institution can require of its members.
“Under the Massachusetts constitution... there is a minimal level of fair dealing that a private association owes to its members,” Silverglate said in a May interview. “That doctrine has been held to apply to the obligations of private universities to its students.”
In May, before he had been retained by the Fly, Silverglate said a potential suit would have “a slightly better than 50-50 chance of winning.”
Even if the Fly ultimately chooses to sue, they could wait until the upcoming Faculty meeting, where it is likely professors will discuss and vote on a faculty motion drafted against the sanctions. Professors Harry R. Lewis ’68 and Richard F. Thomas, two of 12 motion signatories, believe that, if passed, the motion would overturn the sanctions, though the FAS secretary was hesitant to make any definitive forecasts on the motion’s potential power.
While Silverglate declined to speculate on how the vote could affect the Fly’s legal strategy, he said he will follow the faculty proceedings with “a lot of interest.”
Silverglate, a Harvard Law graduate who said he has worked on “students’ rights” cases since 1971, has been a vocal and unrelenting critic of the Harvard administration in his decades practicing law in Cambridge.
In the spring, before the announcement of the final policy, Silverglate co-wrote an op-ed criticizing the efficacy of University efforts to curtail sexual assault. Previously, he blasted Harvard’s Administrative Board, the College’s disciplinary body, for what he perceives as its nebulous rules and culture of secrecy. In a phone interview, Silverglate described the College’s sanctions as “bad judgment, bad policy, and unlawful.”
Though the sanctions have drawn their share of criticism, with former high-level administrators and hundreds of College women expressing their disapproval, they do have their supporters. Three varsity coaches and a Fellow of the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, have publicly praised the policy.
The Fly’s other source of legal counsel, Zalkind Duncan & Bernstein LLP, was founded by Norman Zalkind, who was a legal partner of Silverglate’s from 1969 to 1973. Zalkind and Silverglate have since remained close, and Silverglate says he often works at the firm in a “counsel capacity.”
College spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment for this story.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Indigo, the peer counseling group aimed at addressing issues of race and class in mental health, is taking a hiatus this semester due to a staff shortage.
Anant T. Pai ’19, a peer counselor for Indigo, said the group did not have the number of counselors needed to meet Harvard University Health Services requirements for peer counseling groups. Pai said Indigo counselors plan to remain involved with mental health issues on campus during the hiatus.
“We’re going to be focusing on community counseling in the meantime, working with cultural organizations and doing mental health workshops, because we think that is also an area of high impact,” he said.
The group launched last semester with a goal to increase counseling for students around issues of race and class. Henri C. Garrison ’16, Indigo’s founder, said the group was formed as a resource for traditionally underserved members of the student body.
“In terms of informal conversations I’ve had with students of color about how they were feeling about seeing Indigo out there and seeing that there was this initiative, they were very very excited about it,” Garrison said.
The group worked closely with Barbara Lewis, chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services at HUHS. In an emailed statement, Lewis said that Indigo was in the midst of improving its training program.
“Indigo began last semester with a small group that spent much of its time preparing the space and training staff,” Lewis wrote. “The goal for this fall is to recruit members in order to build a more robust training program before staffing Indigo for peer counseling, and we are excited for the group to move towards being available as a resource for students.”
Garrison said Indigo faced challenges during its initial stages.
“The idea was to do a trial run, see what we get, see if it is going in the direction that we want, with the understanding that this is very experimentational,” Garrison said. “The priority was essentially just getting off the ground, and that’s what we did.”
Paul J. Barreira, director of HUHS, also commented on the challenges Indigo faced as a new group.
“[HUHS staff] were willing to take it on with [Garrison] in terms of training and supervisors, Adams House was willing to find a space,” he said. “But then it kind of lost the momentum because we didn’t have enough people and we didn’t have enough experience doing it.”
The peer counseling group is one of several on campus: Room 13, Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors, Contact Peer Counseling, and RESPONSE Peer Counseling.
Barreira said he thinks Indigo will be up and running again in the spring, after the group has time for more preparations.
“I think it’ll start up again for sure because everybody’s committed to doing it,” Barreira said. “We’re committed to doing the training and the supervision, and I’m sure there are students who are committed to that type of peer counseling program.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than a dozen women auditioned for the Hasty Pudding Theatricals’ annual show last week, putting pressure on the traditionally all-male campus drag troupe to allow women to join its cast—but none received a callback.
The group—famous for its burlesque shows and traditional celebrity “roasts”—said last fall that adding women had been a “topic of serious conversation,” according to then-President of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Robert T. Fitzpatrick ’16. Though women are involved in other aspects of the organization, including the tech crew, creative writing, and business teams, they are excluded from the cast of actors who perform in the Theatricals’ yearly production.
Hasty Pudding Theatricals president Guan-Yue Chen ’17 confirmed that no women received callbacks this year and said that not all men who auditioned were called back. She declined to comment on why the organization is not considering women this year.
The website for the organization reads that “having an all-male cast is an artistic decision” because its “artistic trademark comes from the fact that it challenges traditional perceptions of masculinity.”
Last year, women also auditioned for the Pudding’s cast in protest of its all-male composition, but, similarly, none were called back. Their protest auditions garnered attention from several large media outlets, including the Boston Globe and CBS.
Several women who auditioned for the Hasty Pudding show this year criticized the organization for maintaining an all-male cast.
“I think it’s an abomination that the performing arts organization that has the most funding and the most opportunity is only available for one gender,” Sarah B. Rossman ’19 said. “I kind of understand the artistic idea of an all-male drag show, but there is not an alternative that is equal in any way.”
“As a woman in performing arts, I know that there are so many women who perform at such an amazing caliber and the fact that they’re excluded simply because they’re women makes me very sad,” Nora A. Sagal ’18 said.
Chen declined to comment on the criticism, as did several other Pudding executive board members.
Sagal also auditioned for two traditionally all-male a capella groups last week, the Krokodiloes and the Din and Tonics. The Kroks gave her the first callback the group has ever given to a woman, according to general manager Michael A. Paladino ’17, but they did not ultimately accept her into the group.
The Hasty Pudding protest comes at a time when Harvard administrators are heavily scrutinizing gender exclusivity on campus. In May, University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced an unprecedented policy penalizing members of single-gender unrecognized social organizations, starting with the Class of 2021.
Before the sanctions were announced, two of the College’s final clubs—the Spee and the Fox—invited women to participate in their punch processes and accepted them to their clubs. While the Spee has since initiated women, the Fox reversed its decision in a graduate vote in August.
Though women were not admitted to the cast of the Hasty Pudding Theatricals, some applauded the protest auditions.
“The cast of Hasty Pudding Theatricals may still be all-male, but their auditions sure weren't! Thank you to all the ladies who are continuing to take up space and be heard,” Madison E. Deming ’18 wrote in a Facebook post, which included a photo of an audition sign-up sheet that contained several women’s names.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BOSTON—Donning white coats, a crowd of Harvard Medical School students rallied Monday in support of the University’s dining services workers, who are threatening to strike as they enter the last scheduled week of negotiations with the University before their union’s contract expires.
Nearly 100 students from across the Medical and Dental Schools, located in downtown Boston, gathered on the lawn in front of the Medical School's iconic Gordon Hall, and individual speakers took turns detailing to the crowd how Harvard University Dining Services workers have supported them throughout their time at Harvard.
A group of Medical School students will attend a HUDS bargaining session this week to help guide the discussion on health care benefits, according to Angel Reyes—a Medical student who helped organize the rally.
Dining services employees in Longwood work at Sebastian’s—a popular cafe at Harvard’s School of Public Health.
After gathering on the lawn, the crowd then marched to the building’s steps, chanting, “What do we want? Health care. Who do we want it for? HUDS.”
Members of UNITE HERE Local 26, the union that bargains on behalf of Harvard’s dining employees, are threatening to strike after their current contract—which includes a “no-strike” clause and was already extended from mid-June—expires this Saturday. Workers will vote to authorize a strike on Thursday should the University not comply with some of their demands.
A point of contention in the contract talks is the workers’ health care benefits, which they argue are inadequate partly because they include deductibles.
At the beginning of the negotiations, Harvard offered HUDS the same healthcare plan it extended to the University’s largest union—the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers—last winter, which cut deductibles but slightly increased copayments. The dining services union rejected the University’s offer.
In addition, Local 26 is insisting the University allow interested employees to work year-round. Currently, most HUDS employees do not work during summer or winter recess.
Local 26 is demanding that employees who work year round be guaranteed Under Local 26’s $35,000 minimum salary, according to union spokesperson Tiffany Ten Eyck.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement last week after a different rally that “Harvard’s dining hall workers currently receive highly competitive wages that lead the local and national workforce for comparable positions in the food service industry.”
In late August, Medical School students organized an event aimed at drafting a list of requests for the school’s new dean, George Q. Daley ’82, who was in attendance, which included putting more students on faculty search committees and increasing diversity within the student body. Members of Local 26 spoke about rising healthcare costs at the event and how Medical School students could become involved in their efforts.
Over the past year, students from the Longwood area—including from the Medical School, the School of Public Health, and the Dental School—have called on administrators to double their efforts to increase diversity on their respective campuses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 13, 2016, at 8:21 p.m.
This semester, the all-male Owl Club will, for the first time in its history, hold a punch process “open to all sophomore males,” and by invitation for junior and senior males, according to Owl undergraduate president Kevin D. Rex ’17.
The move makes the Owl the fourth final club to make public its intention to open up its recruitment to a wider swath of the undergraduate population than usual. The all-male Porcellian and A.D. clubs, as well as the the all-female, but soon-to-be gender neutral Sablière Society are also holding single-gender punches open to sophomores this fall.
Punch—the weeks-long process through which final clubs select their new members by inviting successively fewer candidates to club-hosted events—has a long history among Harvard’s final clubs. Traditionally invite-only, this year the Owl’s first event will more closely resemble a typical fraternity rush—open to all sophomore males.
Though Rex, in an email, declined to comment on the rationale behind the club’s change, the other three clubs hosting open punches have attributed, at least partially, the intense pressure levied by Harvard administrators over the past year as an impetus behind their precedent-breaking changes.
That pressure, which last fall also saw the previously all-male Spee Club go co-ed and the all-male Fox Club add women (though that move has now effectively been reversed), culminated in the announcement of a College policy that will heavily penalize members of unrecognized single-gender clubs like the Owl and its single-gender compatriots, starting with the Class of 2021.
Still, since the announcement of the policy in May, no all-male clubs have publicly indicated an intent to go gender neutral, a move College administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, have explicitly and urgently requested.
Though pressure from College administrators may have catalyzed changes at some clubs, transitions have not always been smooth. The decision by Fox Club undergraduates to add women to their ranks without the approval of the club’s graduate board created a deep rift between graduate and undergraduate members. Over the summer, graduates officially voted to remain single-gender, though the current female members will retain “provisional” membership until this summer.
The A.D., meanwhile, experienced some logistical fumbles in planning their first open punch event, apparently unintentionally emailing invitations to some women with masculine-seeming names.
The A.D.’s first open punch event will be held on Tuesday evening at the Sheraton Commander.

CORRECTION: September 13, 2016
Because of an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly indicated the Owl would hold open punch for junior and senior men. In fact, their punch is invite-only.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several times in the first half against its game against Washington (3-2, 1-0 Pac-12), the Harvard men’s soccer team (2-1-1) found itself in the attacking third of the field, but each of those times, the team found itself unable to connect those last few passes it needed to put a point on the board.
With just over three minutes left in the first half, the Crimson was yet again in Washington’s box. A ball had just been sent in from the right, but was deflected by a Huskies defender at the near post. It seemed that once again, Harvard’s attempt would be thwarted, but then the ball found its way back to the Crimson.
After nearly five scoreless halves, senior forward Jake Freeman found the bottom corner of the net off co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu’s deflection.
Freeman’s goal would be the only score of the night, defeating Washington by a final score of 1-0. The win evened the weekend for the Crimson after it lost to  Seattle on Sept. 8.
“We battled and competed and did extremely well, fighting for every ball, keeping it when we got it,” head coach Pieter Lehrer said. “The Washington team is a very good team.”
The Crimson had just two days to rest and regroup after a physical game against Seattle on Thursday, and was hungry for a goal after two shutouts. This would prove to be a difficult task against a strong Washington team, which had won the last three of its four games.
“We knew going in, they were going to be a good team,” Freeman said. “At the same time we knew we had the talent, we had the grit, we had what it took to match them and even outplay them. We did that through the first half, and obviously we got the goal at the end of the half, and whether we were going to have the ball or not through the second half we were going to grind to get the result.”
Both teams came out aggressive and defensive-minded from the starting whistle, with both limited in their shots on goal. Each had attempts on offense, but either through missed opportunities or strong defensive efforts, both were unable to score. The Crimson defense, led by junior goalkeeper Kyle Parks, and supported by senior Daniel Smith, juniors Tyler Savitsky and Justin Crichlow, and freshman Joel Serugo, was central in shutting down an active Washington offense and keeping them from netting a goal. Parks recorded his second-career shutout, defending five shots on target by the Huskies.
In the latter part of the first half, the Crimson began to attack more, with Freeman, who had five of the Crimson’s eight shots on the day, leading the way. Freeman was also the only member of the Harvard squad to shoot on target, claiming all three of the team’s shots on goal.
“I was scoring for the team,” Freeman said. “It’s one of my jobs as a forward, and it was good to get the first one, obviously, and if it results in a win, even better.”
Washington responded with a near-goal of its own after one of its players broke away, but an invigorated Parks and the Crimson defense recovered quickly to end the half with a clean sheet.
The Crimson was slower to start in the second half, with the Huskies possessing the ball and attacking more. After a few minutes of miscommunication and near saves, Harvard found its rhythm again.
Both teams were aggressive again, and both gave up multiple fouls as emotions ran high. In the last few minutes of the second half, the Huskies stepped up its offense and had several chances, with one shot hitting the crossbar and others just over and wide. Despite each team getting just four shots on net in the first half, Washington tallied 18 shots in the second frame.
As the clock wound down, Washington made a last-minute effort to get a goal to send the game into overtime, but Harvard prevailed and finished its opening home stretch with a win.
“I think we’ll keep that mentality going,” Lehrer said. “What we see in training every day, and that competitiveness and that fight and quality, we think, is going to keep carrying into games in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior forward Marissa Balleza has started off her final season for Harvard exactly as expected–dominating and leading the offense just like she has since first donning Crimson three years ago. Not only has Balleza’s goal-scoring ability been consistent, she is also on the fast track to perhaps becoming one of the top scorers in Crimson field hockey history.
Last week’s nail-biter against University of the Pacific was yet another moment in Balleza’s long history of stealing a win for Harvard. The forward notched both of Harvard’s goals off of a team leading five shots in the double overtime contest.
After clinching the win against the Tigers, Balleza has notched an impressive tally of 36 career goals, only seven shy of Judy Collins ’99 who is the only player preventing Balleza from the top spot. The Maryland native has led the team in goals in each of her three seasons, with her best season coming in 2015 when she tallied 13 scores.
Not only does she lead the way in goals, but Balleza is also currently on the brink of breaking several other records, including points per game, goals per game and career points overall. Balleza’s impressive track record of 84 points in 53 games places her at second by only 0.04 points per game behind Sarah Mleczko ’79. Mleczko also is the only person who has had more goals per game in Harvard history with .76 goals per game, whereas Balleza is close behind at second with .68 goals per game.
“[She] scores when no one else can seem to score,” said coach Tjerk van her Waarden. “When you’re down a few goals, or when the game has been tied up. That’s what makes Marissa so special.”
This proved true during Harvard’s game against University of the Pacific. The Crimson trailed 1-0 at the half, but Balleza retaliated immediately in the second period. The senior got a free shot at the net with a penalty stroke that soared past the goalie to the top corner of the Tiger’s net.
Strokes, a rarity in field hockey where a shooter lines up in the center of the penalty circle to go one-on-one against the goalie, are a specialty of Balleza’s. In her six career opportunities with the Crimson, she has only missed on a single stroke.
After the score, the game proceeded to a gridlock with both teams unable to fully execute their offense. The tie resulted in overtime where only six players, instead of the traditional eleven, play for each team.
After a grueling 15 minutes of overtime, the Crimson could not seem to catch a break. A second 15 minute overtime frame was tacked on. Tensions ran high while energy ran low during the extra 30 minutes of play–field hockey operates on a “golden goal” rule where the first team to break the tie during overtime automatically is victorious.
This is exactly the type of situation where Balleza shines. Ten minutes into the second overtime, Balleza managed to salvage a thwarted penalty corner attempt and fired a soaring shot into the top of the University of the Pacific cage off of a pass from sophomore midfielder Emily Duarte.
Despite producing yet another miraculous goal during the final minutes, Balleza does not like to remind herself of the history-making opportunity.
“If I’m thinking about it, it kind of makes me lose focus,” Balleza said. “It honestly screws with my head and so I really try not to think about it and focus more on playing the field hockey at hand.”
Balleza’s final season for the team is also no doubt the most competitive season she has ever played at Harvard. With four nationally ranked teams on the schedule, the field hockey program has made a bold foray into playing more difficult teams than the past few seasons.
With  13 more games until the end of her collegiate career, Balleza has plenty of time to catch up to Collins. At her current rate of .68 goals per game, Balleza is projected to score around nine more goals this season to claim the scoring title and add her name to the record books.
“I mean she’s just fantastic. She shows her team what the value of Marissa is,” van her Waarden said. “Her skills and how she leads the forward line will be missed.”
