After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As far as Disney villains go, Cruella’s aspirations in the 1961 animated film “101 Dalmatians” aren’t especially grand — instead of marrying the prince or orchestrating world domination, all she has her sights set on is a fur coat. Yet her skeletal frame, skunk-themed hair, and hatred of puppies nevertheless cement her as a deeply memorable character — memorable enough, even to warren a live-action spinoff.
The trailer opens with a series of slow, panning shots set in ‘70’s punk-rock London: gritty urban sidewalks, the gates of an imposing gothic mansion, the grille of a vintage car with “DEVIL” as the license plate. Disney’s production quality is stunning as always, with detailed costume and set design coming together to create a world of crisp blacks and whites accented by a sharp red. In a voice edged with lilting arrogance, a woman narrates: “From the very beginning, I saw the world differently from everyone else.”
Cut to the figure of actress Emma Stone dressed as a young Cruella, with scarlet red hair and a black beret ensemble, managing to look both naive and devious at once. The angles of her bone structure aren’t quite as sharp and disturbing as the original, but there’s still that unsettling glint in her eye.
The trailer then plunges into careening shots of criminal behavior interspersed with manic peals of laughter. Director Craig Gillespie, best known for his 2017 biopic “I, Tonya,” strikes a captivating tone that oscillates between tragedy and comedy — reinforced by Connie Francis’ 1957 rendition of “Who’s Sorry Now” as a backing track. Inviting further villainous comparisons, this version of Cruella also bears some resemblance to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker in the trailer’s depiction of her as an unhinged social outcast with an eclectic sense of style and a violent desire for personal vindication.
Still, there is a fresh energy to the glimpses of Stone’s performance that the trailer provides. The central scene of the trailer is set in an ornate white and gold ballroom filled with well-tailored guests. The camera pans over three snarling dalmatians (reminding the audience of the nostalgic magic that is inevitably lost in live-action remakes) to the figure of Cruella in a hooded white cloak. In a classic moment of Disney magic, the cloak evaporates into wisps of flame to reveal a dress of red silk and chiffon, Cruella’s dual-toned hair a cross between carefully coiffed and slightly singed. The screen fades to black with an emphatic note of music, and Cruella triumphantly quotes singer Helen Reddy, “I am woman, hear me roar.”
Of course, it’s a bit unclear how a cocktail of female empowerment and public ostracization leads to a specific obsession with dog fur, but one can’t help feeling enthralled by Stone’s sharp, zealous confidence in leading us there. “I was born brilliant,” Cruella asserts, and for a second, it’s easy to forget that she meets her match with a few dozen litters of puppies. After one last refrain of “who’s sorry now,” the trailer ends with a lingering shot of the mansion from earlier going up in flames against the London skyline. Eyes ringed in dark smudges of ash and eyeliner, hair wildly unkempt, the protagonist offers a final whispered declaration: “I’m Cruella.”

2024 White House hopefuls Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are getting a divorce as of Feb. 19. After almost seven years of marriage, four children, and 11 seasons of “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” one of the world’s most prominent celebrity couples is calling it quits.
Kim and Kanye met in 2003 on the set of recording artist Brandy’s “Talk about our Love” music video, featuring Kanye. However, Kanye claims that he had been interested in Kim for a while before that, saying in a 2013 Ryan Secrest interview that he had seen Kim assisting Paris Hilton and started asking around his Hollywood circles, “Who is this Kim Kardijon?”
Following her 72-day marriage to Kris Humphries, Kim and Kanye started dating in 2012, officially announced with a line in West’s song “Cold.1”. The couple would go on to have their first daughter North in mid-2013, host a $2.8 million dollar wedding in 2014, and as of Feb. 22, begin the process of divorcing, with Kim, the filer, citing “irreconcilable differences.”
Some of the speculative theories as to why the two would divorce revolve around money. In 2016, the rapper begged Mark Zuckerburg on Twitter to help him pay his $53 million debt, a debt that Kim joked she was helping to pay with her $80 million video game income. Although it’s been reported that West has since resolved those 2016 issues, new problems have arisen. A particularly prominent TikTok from @thelawyerangela speculates that the ongoing multimillion-dollar lawsuit against West’s “Sunday Service” choir played an intimate role in the divorce. In the video, a lawyer points out an interesting coincidence between the start of separation rumors and the necessary timeline to split spousal debts. In California, debts accrued before a couple splits could potentially be the responsibility of both partners. That makes the date of separation critically important, and what better way to formalize a split date than to have it published in TMZ.
Over the summer of 2020, Kanye launched a run for president. At a rally in South Carolina, Kanye accused Kim of wanting to abort their first child and claimed that Harriet Tubman didn’t free any slaves. He would go on to send explosive tweets throughout the summer, claiming that Kim and her family tried to lock him up and that Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” was about him along with unclear comparisons between Kris Kardashian (whom he called “Kris Jong-Un”) and white supremacy.
Other reports cite Kanye’s displeasure with the Kardashian lifestyle and the show. Another source said Kim is “growing up” and wants to take her legal career to the next level, presumably in a way that cannot happen with West. A bizarre (discredited) rumor that Kanye was having an affair with Jeffree Star was also circulated around the internet.
The world will likely never know all the intimate details of the divorce or what precipitated it. The influence, however, that the seven-year union had on pop culture is undeniable. Both individuals came into the marriage with considerable star power, but it is impossible to separate their astronomical rises from the meshing of their two worlds. During their years together Kanye brought Yeezy to the world, which has radically changed the way fashion and sneakers are produced and consumed. Yeezy undeniably fed off Kim’s mainstream prominence to bring its shoes out of the sneakerhead world and into the closets of reality TV junkies. Kanye’s passion and unpredictability continued to push the popularity of “Keeping up with the Kardashians,” and this last season’s documentation of the divorce drama will likely be one of the most-watched yet.
The next chapter for Kim and Kanye, without their show, without their home together, and without each other is unclear. But undoubtedly, there will be babies named Saint, snake emojis under Taylor Swift’s Instagram, and more nuanced conversations about how families deal with issues for years to come. Kimye is over, but Kimye’s legacy is just beginning.

After listening to “Butter-Fly" for the eleventh time through, your Spotify Activity might look strange. But, if your friends heard the London singer and rapper’s Feb. 19 release too, they would understand. That is how addicting British artist Lava La Rue’s newest EP is, and it’s about time the world takes the “Tube” to destination Lavatown.
Lava La Rue is a 22-year-old Black queer multi-hyphenate from West London whose alternative R&B style is captivating audiences worldwide. “Butter-Fly” is a psychedelic departure from the underground hip-hop style of their first studio album, “Stitches” (2019). The five-song set in “Butter-Fly” is a vulnerable dive into La Rue’s conscious, a soundtrack to their life. Through this exploration of identity and love, specifically queer love, La Rue declares a sort of manifesto by which they choose to live. To call “Butter-Fly” refreshing would be an understatement; instead, the transportive soundscape is altogether world-altering.
The set begins with “Magpie,” arguably the best song on the EP. Immediately, listeners are invited to La Rue’s world through liquid gold instrumentals full of synths and electric guitars serving as a backdrop for La Rue’s effortlessly dreamy vocals and smooth rap style. The meaning behind “Magpie” became clearer with the music video release: “The MAGPIE video is supposed to be a personification of London’s subcultural history timeline & many ways British Caribbean sound system culture,” La Rue said on Instagram. What is so fascinating is that this intricacy abundantly apparent in “Magpie,” from its cultural significance, to the production, to La Rue’s ability to world-build in a three-and-a-half minute song.
“Angel,” featuring London-based singer-songwriter Deb Never, is a simultaneously groovy and emotional funk ballad bound to get stuck in listeners’ heads. The song depicts the feelings of nostalgia felt by two people for a love that feels so tangible, so physically close, yet painful as the lovers are worlds apart. “Angel” ultimately portrays love lost, inviting the listener to dance to momentarily escape the pain.
“Goofy Hearts Club,” the EP’s longest track, is an experiment on its own, and a beautiful one at that. “Goofy Hearts Club” allows us to understand La Rue’s inner-turmoil: “We in a deadly game and / Maybe I'm just into the thrill of that." La Rue finds themself at a crossroads in their co-dependent relationship: “Oh, it'll be so much better with you by my side / I'm done ringing your phone / Tell me that you want it, show me you adore me.” This dream-like exploration of unrequited love is the honest conversation we are often too scared to have.
Embodying queer love as resistance, as agency, and as world-building is a key component of La Rue’s work, and “G.O.Y.D.” is the EP’s flagship queer anthem. “G.O.Y.D.,” which features singer-songwriter Clairo, is a response to Clairo’s 2018 “B.O.M.D.” In the song, La Rue proposes to be more than just friends. Whether in an actual conversation or a day-dream, La Rue’s lyrics are directed at their “friend,” identifying the palpable tension between the two, the overly friendly gestures, and the life of love they could be sharing. “G.O.Y.D.” is also significant in its showcasing of La Rue’s ability to rap, an ode to La Rue’s entry point into music. They keep it smooth but fast-paced, drawing on histories of the underground Black British hip hop scene.
La Rue ends with their personal history-turned-manifesto, “Lift You Up,” featuring artist and remixer Karma Kid. La Rue delves into the hardships they faced growing up in West London, in school and foster care, having to face a capitalist and misogynistic world with little to no one by their side. Of course, La Rue is now a rapidly-growing artist rewriting the alt R&B music scene and finally getting the attention they deserve, but “Lift You Up” is their origin story that contextualizes La Rue’s creativity and complexity — the backbone to “Butter-Fly.”
The EP’s single downfall comes in its melding of the latter three songs, where it is especially hard to differentiate “Goofy Hearts Club” and “G.O.Y.D.” when listening to the body of work in its entirety. Their openings, though instrumentally distinct, carry similar patterns of entry into the lyrics. However, this is a small price to pay for the end product of a cohesive experience that delivers a stunning auditory biopic of La Rue’s own dimension.
It is clear “Butter-Fly” is the manifestation of Lava La Rue’s heart and soul. Here is an artist who does everything in their own way. Every project of theirs has a big splash of La Rue, whether an outfit or fashion campaign, whether an artists’ collective or music project. “Butter-Fly”’s world-changing sound experience is indeed the world La Rue is building for themself through their artistry, unapologetically Lava La Rue. How about we stay in Lavatown for a bit longer?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every fall, a new group of Harvard students enter campus with extraordinary talent, wide-ranging interests, and a deep passion for civic engagement. And every spring, after corporate recruiters entice us nearly every week for our four years on campus, most of the senior class leaves for a few private industries. Of the Class of 2020 entering the workforce, 63 percent are working in finance, consulting, and technology. The numbers are especially striking for men. For every Harvard male student entering government, nonprofit, or educational work, there are more than twelve Harvard male students entering these three rarified industries. Essentially, Harvard is a sorting hat for Huffle-finance, Consulting-claw, and Gryffin-tech. It can feel like there aren’t any other options.
But it’s no wonder so many students enter these industries. The jobs pay $70,000 to more than $110,000 right out of college. And before students have any idea what they want to do, Harvard lets major corporations start recruiting freshmen. In fact, the Office of Career Services schedules students for finance recruiting on Sept. 2 — the very first day of classes.
The truth is that major corporations treat Harvard like a talent agency, and Harvard lets them.
Almost any student and administrator will tell you that the mission of Harvard is to educate “citizens and citizen-leaders” and, of course, Harvard succeeds at this. That comes with the brand power its degree affords and the extraordinary institutional resources, remarkable peers, and brilliant professors it bestows upon its students.
Harvard College’s mission, however, is not only to “educate citizens and citizen-leaders” but to educate citizens and citizen-leaders “for our society.” To fulfill its mission, Harvard College must act first and foremost for our society, both in its institutional policy and in what it prepares and encourages its graduates to do.
At a time when elite institutions are being attacked for not doing enough to serve the common good — even having their endowments taxed for the first time — it's time for Harvard to take its mission more seriously. Here are some bold steps Harvard can take to better serve society:
Harvard can start by making demonstrated public purpose a top priority in admissions. Every applicant could be asked to write about how they intend to use their Harvard education for the betterment of our society.
How campus recruiting works would also need to change. While there is a Social Impact Expo Marathon, it's one of the last career fairs, beginning in March, well after finance, tech, and consulting have already recruited. This year's Social Impact Expo Marathon didn't even make the OCS Academic & Recruiting Campus Calendar. To feature social impact as a central part of Harvard’s culture and mission, why not move it to the fall semester and make it an entire season of exciting events and celebrity speakers on the scale of Housing Day, Yardfest, and Commencement? A social impact season would generate excitement for public purpose work and inculcate an impact-oriented culture. Going further, Harvard could flip the recruiting season so impact organizations and fellowships recruit in the fall and spring and private corporations in the spring only. This would reverse the incentive structure that promotes private job offers over impact opportunities.
In University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s installation address, he proposed guaranteeing a public service internship to every undergraduate who wants one. Harvard is a national leader in providing funded summer opportunities: We have eight different internship programs, including the Mindich Service Fellowship, all providing 529 opportunities in total in 2019. By comparison, Duke University’s comparable program at full scale provided 372 opportunities. Nonetheless, Harvard still has a long way to go in meeting student’s demand for social impact opportunities. With 1,068 unique applicants in 2019, only half of them were placed. While raising the funds to place the other half of applicants is an exciting first step, Harvard should take President Bacow’s goal one step further by creating a common expectation, even a requirement, that every student do a funded social impact summer.
This expectation should also include every student doing a social impact year after college before entering private industry. Harvard could ask major corporations recruiting seniors to fund a one-year impact fellowship that comes with the job. This fellowship will allow students to experience effecting social change and give them something to circle back to if they later decide to change career paths.
If Harvard’s mission is to educate citizen-leaders for our society, what does it mean that Congress taxed Harvard’s endowment for the first time? What does it mean that President Joe Biden says we can’t end our country’s student debt crisis for everyone because it would help Harvard students (even though only 0.3 percent of student loan bearers attended Ivy League colleges)? I think it means that Harvard isn’t fulfilling its mission — Harvard is seen as not doing enough for our society. It means that a lot of people seem to think Harvard simply trains elites for the sake of training elites.
We are entering a new gilded age — as the majority of our graduates embark on some of the most lucrative career paths and join the prospering elite, the rest of the country is struggling: 11 million children live in poverty, 35 million Americans face hunger, and 2.3 million people are incarcerated, the highest rate in the world.
In the face of all of this, how can Harvard ask so little of us?

Five months ago, I destroyed my knee wakeboarding. Feet strapped onto a plastic board, skimming the glassy lake water, I was enjoying the last glimpse of summer until, all of a sudden, the board caught the edge of the water and violently twisted my legs out from under me. Shock filled my body like ice as my knee dislocated and my ligaments tore like paper.
My knee was twice its normal size. I couldn’t even straighten it all the way. I remember sitting in the doctor’s office, breath stifled by an ever-present mask, knowing I had to get on a flight to Boston to start my freshman year in less than two weeks. Every fiber of my being wanted to scream — and cry — out of outrage and desperate grief.
But I didn’t. Just like I didn’t when prom got canceled, when graduation was painted with masks and distance, when teachers and friends and family were spared hugs and celebratory embraces, when summer turned into a monotony of isolation, when death tolls and infection rates colored the news of every day. Mirroring my reaction to Covid-19, blinders went up, numbness took over, and the cork bottling up my grief remained tightly wedged. The accident had thrown a pebble into the waters of my life; I was trying to contain the ripples.
When my knee injury happened, I was unable to think about the weight of what I was going through and what I had gone through. The next thing, the next thing; my mind was trapped in a loop of survival. Thankfully, those blinders have started to come down. My view has widened from encompassing just the next step to working through the exponentially-expanding ripples instigated by the pebble of my accident. I’ve stopped trying to bargain away my pain or circumstance for what my narrow and finite mind deems a “better” outcome. I’ve accepted the injury and its future implications; I’ve accepted that when I feel any type of emotion connected to that original trauma, I need to acknowledge it. I must acknowledge it.
I was able to move through the five stages of grief — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance — because my accident was a singularity, an event confined to one moment of time. There was a beginning, there was an ending, and afterward, there was space for my emotional absolution.
But how do you move on from something that hasn’t yet ended? How do you begin to reckon with a calamity when it isn’t confined to one moment, when every day it strips life from you and your loved ones?
No one can eat inside Annenberg. Housing Day is a distant memory celebrated by only juniors and seniors. Dorms and houses resound with echoes of half-empty silence. Widener Library stands solemnly. Lecture halls accumulate delicate layers of dust. And I, a freshman, struggle to write this paragraph as I do not even know everything I have missed; I long for what I do not know.
Covid-19 is an ongoing, collective trauma. It has taken lives and livelihoods, wiped away new memories and new beginnings, induced states of repetition and depression, forced conclusions and endings before we were ready to say goodbye. Every one of us has lost someone, and every one of us has lost a little bit of our own life.
But, no one seems to be talking about it. We analyze statistics. We yell at one another to “wear a mask!” We scold those who break social-distancing norms (while maybe secretly wishing we could do the same in order to experience a taste of normalcy). We read the news. We use humor to mask our dried-out eyes from hours and hours and hours of Zoom calls. “I’m as good as I can be,” we say. Phrases of distraction. Phrases of survivalism.
But we don’t collectively mourn. We don’t collectively cry. We don’t, as a society, acknowledge the weight of what has happened and what is happening every day. We all have blinders on. The next thing, the next thing; we can’t afford to deviate our eyes from the narrow path of the future, because if we do, we’ll see the burning, ragged ruins all around. We do not know how to mourn. We can’t afford to.
This is partly because mourning something like Covid-19 is near impossible. Never have we had to wrestle with ongoing and continuous tragedy. Never before have we tried to move from denial to acceptance when the trauma isn’t confined to a space and time.
Even so, we must learn how to mourn. It is a choice, a choice we must make every day. Not to rip off the blinders in one fell swoop, but to acknowledge and wrestle with every emotion within our collective trauma. We must be kind to ourselves. We must learn how to lament.
This last year has not been normal, so there is no reason to treat it as such. We are great at superficially acknowledging these “unprecedented times” through emails and check-ins before Zoom meetings, but we have yet to delve elbow-deep into the parts of our mind partitioned off by blinders.
We must accept the weight of this last year and the ripples in the water to come. We all must learn how to mourn.

Educating for American Democracy — a team of more than 300 academics and educators with Harvard professors Danielle S. Allen and Jane Kamensky on its executive committee – outlined plans to reform the civics curriculum in the United States on Monday.
The report, entitled “Roadmap to Educating for American Democracy,” represents the culmination of 16 months of work and seeks to instill comprehensive civics and history knowledge from kindergarten through twelfth grade to give the next generation the tools to participate in political processes.
Sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Department of Education, the roadmap stresses that it is neither a rigid set of standards nor a national curriculum, but rather a map of “the disciplinary and conceptual terrain” required for “healthy civic participation.”
The report proposes a number of goals to be accomplished by the end of the decade. It specifically suggests that, by 2030, 60 million students should have access to comprehensive civics education, 100,000 schools should be equipped with a “Civic Learning Plan” and the resources required to support it, and one million teachers should be trained in civics through professional development programs.
In a recent op-ed for the Washington Post, Allen linked the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol to a failure to provide adequate civic education, writing, “The lesson was etched into our soul that day.”
“We should desire to compete on the world’s stage as the kind of society we are, namely, a constitutional democracy,” Allen wrote. “That requires civic education to support the knowledge, skills and civic virtues needed for a healthy republic.”
In a forum moderated by PBS NewsHour anchor Judy Woodruff, Kamensky said constitutional democracy itself was at stake unless educators work to reenvision civics and history education in the United States.
“Young people are losing confidence in our form of government and in their ability to participate in civil society,” Kamensky said. “We’re here in part because the American educational system has neglected history and civics at all levels.”
Kamensky referenced the 2018 National Assessment of Educational Progress civics exam, in which fewer than 25 percent of eighth graders demonstrated proficiency in civics, and only 15 percent demonstrated proficiency in history.
“The deficit comes in part from a lack of investment,” Kamensky said. “We now invest about $50 a student each year in the important STEM fields, yet only five cents per student a year on civics, or a ratio of 1,000 to one.”
Allen wrote in her op-ed that when considering the US’s past, present, and future, it is important to take into account both the “hard histories” and “unique achievements” of the American story, invoking both the New York Times’ 1619 Project and the Trump administration’s 1776 Commission.
“Disagreement is a feature, not a bug, of our constitutional democracy,” she wrote. “The question is whether we can learn to disagree productively.”
Paul O. Carrese, director of the School of Civic & Economic Thought and Leadership at Arizona State University, said the differing disciplines, political views, and experiences of those on the Education for American Democracy team represented an important model of cooperation for both the education system and the nation.
“We fully expect that because it’s a free country, there will be disagreement with this,” Carrese said. “I would say to my conservative friends: this is not a national curriculum, this is not a one-size-fits-all attempt to force anything on the states, but it does call for debate.”
While only “advisory” in nature, the report concludes by calling for all Americans to take history and civics education seriously in order to “navigate the dangerous shoals” the country finds itself in.
“To those who believe in America’s principles and promise, what we have inherited is painfully imperfect,” the report reads. “It is our task not to abandon but to improve it.”

Meena Venkataramanan ’21 was named a member of the Gates Cambridge Scholarship Class of 2021 on Feb. 8, making her one of 24 U.S. citizens tapped to receive full funding for graduate studies at the University of Cambridge.
The Gates Cambridge Scholarship was established in 2000, after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation furnished the University of Cambridge with a $210 million gift to sponsor the studies of at least 225 students at any given time.
Students selected for the scholarship must display “outstanding intellectual ability,” “reasons for choice of course,” “a commitment to improving the lives of others,” “and leadership potential,” per the website.
Venkataramanan — a former Crimson News editor — is a joint concentrator in English and South Asian Studies with a secondary field in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights. She said she will pursue an M.Phil. in English Studies: Modern and Contemporary Literature at the University of Cambridge to explore the narratives of contemporary refugees and asylum seekers in the United States and the United Kingdom.
“I think that these issues of immigration are ones that have often gone overlooked, and these stories have often been overshadowed and silenced — especially when it comes to certain kinds of immigrants, such as undocumented immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers,” Venkataramanan said.
After completing her M.Phil., Venkataramanan said she plans to attend law school with the eventual goal of working at the intersection of law and journalism.
“Solely looking at issues through a legal lens sometimes can be dehumanizing, and often we think about things in abstraction when we look at them through legal frameworks alone,” Venkataramanan said. “Looking at things through journalistic frameworks would allow us to shed light on human stories and individual stories.”
English Professor William J. “James” Simpson — one of the professors whom Venkataramanan credits with inspiring her “passion for literature” — wrote in an email that Venkataramanan’s responses in class were “unfailingly engaged, radiant, and intelligent.” He added that he was also “inspired by her commitment to connect literature – even literature from long ago – with the urgency of now.”
Jill E. Abramson ’76 — the former executive editor of The New York Times and lecturer on journalism at Harvard — wrote in an emailed statement of her admiration for Venkataramanan.
“I once gave a talk at the Kennedy School and Meena, then a sophomore I think, was the first student to ask me a question. She’s not afraid to stand up and speak her mind,” Abramson wrote.
“She’s not a bragger. I didn’t know she won the scholarship until I read about it, although we speak once a week and I consider us to be close,” Abramson added. “I admire her immensely and am very fond of her.”
Beyond the academic work that awaits her at Cambridge, Venkataramanan said she is excited to engage with her fellow Gates Cambridge scholars.
“I was really excited to join this community and hopefully be able to engage not only with this kind of work, but also meet really inspired people from all around the world who are also doing really critical scholarship in their fields of study,” she said.

Harvard students reacted with disappointment and frustration after President Joe Biden said on Feb. 16 he would not forgive more than $10,000 in federal student loan debt per borrower, singling out Harvard as an institution whose students did not require debt relief.
In a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, Biden said he was unwilling to address top Democrats’ calls to raise debt forgiveness to $50,000 per borrower. Biden also said he was unwilling to forgive “the billions of dollars of debt” for individuals who attended “Harvard and Yale and Penn.”
“I will not make that happen,” Biden said in response to an audience member who asked what he would do to push for $50,000 in debt forgiveness.
Morgan R. Pratt, a Master of Public Policy candidate at the Harvard Kennedy School, said they were concerned Biden seemed to be using his position “to actively push the population right” on the issue of debt forgiveness.
“I understand that Biden has the authority to act unilaterally on this issue,” Pratt said. “Using a town hall to sow doubt and discredit the position of student loan forgiveness is really troubling to me, personally.”
After the town hall, Democratic leadership renewed calls for the administration to pursue greater debt relief.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer ’71 (D.-N.Y.) and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.) urged Biden to relieve $50,000 of student loan debt per borrower, citing constitutional precedent for widespread debt cancellation through executive powers.
“Cancelling $50,000 in federal student loan debt will help close the racial wealth gap, benefit the 40% of borrowers who do not have a college degree, and help stimulate the economy,” they wrote in a joint statement on Feb. 17. “It’s time to act. We will keep fighting.”
In an email to The Crimson, an aide to Warren cited multiple analyses that support forgiving $50,000 in debt, including estimates from Brandeis University that projected such relief would result in complete loan forgiveness for over 75 percent of households.
Jason E. Anesini, a third year Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry, said the net difference of $40,000 between Biden’s campaign trail promise of $10,000 and Democratic senators’ proposal of $50,000 per borrower would make a “huge difference.”
“Getting rid of student loans definitely allows people to study disciplines that are interesting to them, not necessarily think about, ‘Well, what’s the job I’m getting after I graduate?’” he said. “I think as well, there’s a real mental health risk that people take on bearing six figures worth of debt from their undergraduate experience.”
Cassandra Luca ’21, a former Crimson Arts editor, said Biden should go farther than canceling $10,000 of debt per borrower and eradicate student loan debt in its entirety.
“It makes sense that if you want to have a robust middle class, you would eliminate it,” she said. “The calls have been out there for President Biden to give out to eliminate $10,000 off of everybody’s student loan debt — I would go further and say that we should just erase it, period.”
“It’s just really a question of, ‘If you have loans, should they be forgiven?’” Luca added. “And I believe the answer is yes.”
Eileen Connor — the legal director of the Project on Predatory Student Lending at the Harvard Law School — critiqued Biden for his emphasis on students at elite institutions.
“The reality is that the majority of students who graduate from Harvard and the elite schools the President mentioned in the CNN town hall graduate with zero student loan debt,” she wrote in an emailed statement.
Connor wrote that the focus should be on another demographic: students saddled with debt from for-profit colleges, some of whom she has represented in court.
“When we talk about student debt, people like our clients — who went to for-profit schools mostly for vocation-specific certificates and associate degrees — get lost,” Connor wrote.
Ultimately, Pratt said they do not anticipate Biden will follow through on his campaign promises of debt relief at all.
“I wouldn’t expect anything at this point,” Pratt added. “It’s making me think he was just pressured into taking this position on student loans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Developer Tishman Speyer, Harvard-Allston Task Force members, and local residents convened virtually Thursday to consider updated plans for Harvard’s proposed Enterprise Research Campus.
The meeting comes as Tishman Speyer is soliciting public comment on the project notification form they filed with the Boston Planning and Development Agency for the ERC on Feb. 2. The feedback period will close March 15.
The ERC, per the developer’s updated filings, will span six acres and include a hotel, a conference center, and two acres of greenspace. Tishman Speyer is aiming to break ground on the development’s main buildings in early 2022, according to the plans.
Representatives from landscape design studio SCAPE, design firm Studio Gang, and architecture company Henning Larsen accompanied Tishman Speyer at Thursday’s meeting to elaborate on the ERC’s layout and role in Allston.
Jessica Hughes, director of Tishman Speyer’s Boston operations, said the ERC will consist of two phases, A and B.
Phase A will comprise 900,000 square feet, and, per Hughes, will contain 70 percent commercial and 30 percent residential space. The “heart” of Phase A, she said, is the greenway, which would provide “two times the space” than originally presented in a 2018 development proposal.
By contrast, Phase B would span nearly 1,000,000 square feet. Though “not part of the scope of the proposed project at this time,” this phase would “eliminate” planned surface parking lots and instead focus on creating open space, per Hughes.
“Our vision for Phase B is to give the same high priority as our phase A plan to the creation of community open space that will ultimately connect Rena Park and Soldiers Field Road with a continuous greenway,” she added.
Jeanne Gang, founder of Studio Gang, said in order to ensure the sustainability of the project, the developers will consider the ERC’s layout so it is as energy efficient as possible.
“We’ve been working on sustainability from the very beginning, and it’s about how we scale and place our buildings in relation to the solar orientation to reduce energy use, and how we consider embodied carbon and manage operational energy,” she said.
Gang also said creating an ERC that is well-connected with the vicinity and encourages Allstonians to engage with its amenities is a priority.
“We’re really dreaming of an ERC that contributes to Allston’s unique character and exciting street life — with a pedestrian oriented environment — and that brings activities and climatic comfort every season,” she added.
Hughes stated that Tishman Speyer is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and will subsidize ground floor retail space for local businesses owned by women or minorities.
Christine Varriale, Harvard-Allston Task Force member and local resident, asked how Tishman and Speyer would partake in outreach to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion.
“We'll be doing a significant amount of outreach,” Hughes said. “I think we look at it as a combination of spaces, they’ll be, you know, permanent spaces pop up spaces, you know, test kitchens, that sort of thing where there’ll be a lot of opportunities.”
Ed A. Kotomori, also a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force, said at the meeting that he would like to see rent subsidized to match 60 percent area median income to ensure that people in the neighborhood can afford to live there.
Jo-Ann Barbour, the executive director of Charlesview, Inc., said she hoped the development would go beyond standards set by Boston’s Inclusionary Development Policy that require 13 percent affordable housing in new developments.
“We want to see not only an extension of 13 percent of IDP, but also an extension around the number, the percentage of affordability,” Barbour said. “If you can go from 50 to 60 to 70 to 100 percent so that there’s a mix of income, that’s really important.”
Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association and a local resident, said he was concerned about safe and equitable access to the ERC for low- to moderate-income residents, seniors, and those with disabilities.
“I have absolutely no confidence with the existing public transportation infrastructure in this site,” D’Isidoro said. “You’d be asking some people who really can’t walk that far or, you know, have accessibility issues, I think it’s almost like you kind of take them out of the picture.”
Gerald Autler, senior project manager for the BPDA, said that his agency and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority understand the frustration with the current service and are discussing possible solutions, including working with Cambridge to better connect the area via bus routes.
“This team should be thinking long and hard about that, but it’s also part of this bigger picture, and we’re excited to hear more,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law professor of Japanese Legal Studies J. Mark Ramseyer reportedly sent a thank you message to a supporter this week whose email denigrated Koreans’ “national character” and called Ramseyer Japan’s “only hope.”
Ramseyer is already under fire in Korea for a paper that claims — against the historical consensus — that sex slaves under the Imperial Japanese military, known as “comfort women,” were voluntarily employed.
“Comfort women” is a term used to refer to women and girls from Imperial Japan’s occupied territories — many of whom were of Korean origin — that were sexually enslaved by the Japanese military before and during World War II. Ramseyer drew international backlash last month with his article, “Contracting for sex in the Pacific War,” that claimed that those women were gainfully contracted to Japanese brothels.
In a now-deleted post Tuesday, Twitter user @tukiyoni_saraba — whose account features many pro-Japanese nationalist tweets — posted a screenshot purportedly showing email correspondence with Ramseyer in Japanese.
“It seems like the Koreans are continuing their relentless attacks,” the Twitter user wrote to Ramseyer. “Over there, they have an unusual national character of attacking you to the very end if you display weakness.”
The supporter wrote that they hoped Ramseyer would not “lose to” Korean people, further describing the professor as the “only hope” of the Japanese people.
The supporter concluded by asking Ramseyer to “keep at it.”
According to the screenshot, Ramseyer responded by writing, “Thank you very much for sending me the kind and heartening letter. I will do the best I can!”
A former colleague of Ramseyer’s at Harvard’s Reischauer Institute of Japanese Studies provided The Crimson with a separate email exchange in which Ramseyer appears to confirm the legitimacy of the thank-you note sent to the Twitter user.
“When people send me emails thanking me for what I’m doing and offering me encouragement, I send back a polite message thanking them for their letters of support,” Ramseyer wrote to his colleague, who requested anonymity to provide private email communications.
Ramseyer added in the email to the colleague that the thank-you message he sent is his “stock message” to supporters.
Law School professor Jeannie Suk Gersen tweeted Thursday that she found it “hard to imagine” Ramseyer would respond positively to the supporter’s message.
“I’m finding it hard to imagine a [Law School colleague] would write appreciatively back to a person expressing views to him about Koreans as a category,” she wrote in the tweet.
When asked about the legitimacy of the messages Thursday evening, Ramseyer declined to comment.
Many South Korean activists previously alleged that the Japanese government had influence over Ramseyer’s work.
In a Feb. 5 interview with The Crimson, Ramseyer declined to deny that he has ties to the Japanese government, saying, “Now why would I do that?”
In a follow-up emailed statement, he wrote that any connections to the Japanese government had “absolutely” no influence on his work.
Ramseyer’s comfort women article has drawn condemnation at and beyond Harvard’s campus. Harvard affiliates have staged an event with a surviving comfort woman, withdrawn donation plans, and penned petitions, while scholars worldwide have written rebuttals, with some demanding the article’s withdrawal. The International Review of Law and Economics, the journal set to print Ramseyer’s paper in its March issue, has since delayed the issue’s publication to investigate concerns around the article.
University of Pennsylvania law professor Jonathan Klick, an editor of the IRLE, wrote in a Thursday statement the journal is “currently awaiting” a response it requested from Ramseyer regarding criticisms of his paper.
Ramseyer’s paper in the IRLE is not his only work on imperial Japanese history that has recently been called into question.
On Feb. 18, the European Journal of Law and Economics published an article by Ramseyer studying Koreans living in Japan in the early 20th century. Five days later, however, an editor’s note was posted above the article stating that the journal editors are investigating “concerns” around the paper.
Ramseyer is also amending his chapter in the Cambridge Handbook of Privatization — which is expected to be published in August — after the editors received “very insightful” suggestions, he wrote in an email to The Crimson on Feb. 20.
Cambridge University Press spokesperson Matt Gallaway confirmed that the chapter in question is currently being reviewed by Ramseyer as well as an ethics committee.
The Korean American Society of Massachusetts plans to stage a protest on Saturday in front of the Smith Campus Center.
Gil Lee, a spokesperson for the organization, said the protest will call for the University to take action, as well as the IRLE to retract the article.
Harvard leadership has remained silent amid the uproar over Ramseyer’s paper, except Amy Fantasia, a speechwriter for University President Lawrence S. Bacow. Fantasia wrote in an email to Volunteer Agency Network of Korea — a South Korean NGO which emailed Bacow — that Ramseyer is protected by academic freedom, and that his views “are his own.”
VANK posted Fantasia’s response online, and University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain confirmed it was Fantasia’s message.
In an email to The Crimson on Feb. 14, Ramseyer wrote that he was assembling a “short package” of material responding to the criticisms around his paper. He wrote on Feb. 17 that he would have the package ready “in a few days.”
He has declined to answer questions about the “package” since mid-February, however, and has not released any material publicly.

When the anti-affirmative action group suing Harvard College over its race-conscious admissions practices petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case last week, Students for Fair Admissions reiterated arguments it has made since first suing Harvard roughly seven years ago — and also introduced fresh arguments to the justices of the nation’s highest court.
The high-profile lawsuit against Harvard College over its use of race in admissions escalated last week when SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari. For the Court to hear the case, four out of nine justices on the bench must agree.
The U.S. District of Massachusetts ruled in October 2019 that Harvard College’s race-conscious admissions practices do not illegally discriminate against Asian American applicants. Following SFFA’s appeal, in November 2020, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court’s ruling.
In its petition, SFFA’s lawyers refuted those courts’ rulings and again alleged Harvard illegally discriminates against Asian American applicants under the 1964 Civil Rights Act’s Title VI, which prevents federally-funded programs or institutions from discriminating based on “race, color, or national origin.”
During a Tuesday meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, University President Lawrence S. Bacow said Harvard will “vigorously” defend its race-conscious admissions practices before the highest court in the nation if it chooses to take up the case.
While SFFA doubled down on that long-standing argument, the group’s lawyers also introduced a new argument: that the Supreme Court should consider overturning the 2003 landmark case Grutter v. Bollinger, in which the Court ruled the use of race in higher education admissions practices is constitutional.
If the Court chooses to take up SFFA v. Harvard, its response to that argument will determine the fate of affirmative action throughout U.S. institutions of higher education.
Here’s what you should know from SFFA’s petition.
SFFA’s petition opens by asking: “Should this Court overrule Grutter v. Bollinger... and hold that institutions of higher education cannot use race as a factor in admissions?”
In that landmark case, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in favor of the University of Michigan Law School’s use of race in admissions. The Court stated the university’s admissions policies pass the “strict scrutiny” test — the highest form of judicial review courts use when deciding the constitutionality of government discrimination. To that end, the Court ruled in Grutter that the law school’s use of race in admissions served a “compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body” and was “narrowly tailored” to achieve that interest.
The Court’s answer to SFFA’s question would have implications reaching well beyond Harvard.
“This is, in my opinion, what SFFA has been hoping to be able to argue from the beginning – that Grutter should be overturned,” said Mishell B. Kneeland, a lawyer whose arguments in trial court were used to defend race-conscious admissions practices in the 2016 case Fisher v. University of Texas — the most recent case in which the Supreme Court upheld affirmative action.
SFFA’s lawyers argue in the petition that Grutter is “grievously wrong” because it violates the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment. SFFA also challenges Grutter’s claim that diversity is a compelling justification for the use of race in admissions, citing various other Court rulings that argued the consideration of race did not satisfy strict scrutiny.
“This Court has held that racial classifications are legal if they satisfy strict scrutiny. But this Court often rejects interests as not compelling enough to justify racial classifications,” the petition reads. “Why these interests are not compelling–but ‘cross-racial understanding’ and ‘livelier classroom discussion’ are...—is impossible to explain. Grutter should have rejected these all-too-familiar justifications for sorting students by race.”
The “educational benefits” of race-conscious admissions that the Court identified in Grutter — such as combating racial stereotypes and preparing students for diversity in the workforce — are “suspect,” per SFFA.
SFFA also argues that Grutter has engendered “significant negative consequences,” such as sustaining admissions practices that stereotype Asian Americans and discriminate against those applicants.
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill law professor Theodore M. Shaw said he believes SFFA is attempting to use concerns held by Asian American applicants as a vehicle to challenge affirmative action, and called the tactic “striking.”
Even if the Court chooses to uphold Grutter, SFFA called on the justices to overturn the lower courts’ rulings, which found Harvard’s admissions practices pass strict scrutiny.
SFFA’s lawyers alleged that Harvard’s use of race in admissions is not “narrowly tailored” to bring about educational benefits through student body diversity.
SFFA reiterated its long-standing argument that Harvard’s use of race in admissions is illegal because it allegedly discriminates against Asian American applicants, uses race as a determinative factor in admissions decisions, engages in racial balancing, and does not use race-neutral alternatives — actions the Supreme Court previously ruled are illegal.
In her 2019 ruling, Massachusetts District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs ruled that Harvard was not culpable of all four counts. The First Circuit ruled that Burroughs did not err in her decision.
Despite SFFA’s assertion that the previous rulings in the case are incorrect, the Supreme Court must accept the lower courts’ findings unless the justices find those judges’ decisions “clearly erroneous.”
“The trial court makes findings. And those findings are based on the evidence that was offered at trial,” Berkeley law professor David B. Oppenheimer said. “The factual findings of the court are binding on the appellate court – the First Circuit – and on the Supreme Court, unless they find that the findings were clearly erroneous, they’re clearly incorrect. That’s a high standard for a court.”
In its effort to convince the justices to grant a writ of certiorari, SFFA made use of the Court’s previous language.
When arguing that Grutter is “grievously wrong,” SFFA makes use of a broad range of cases pertaining to race and discrimination on which the Court previously ruled.
“‘Grievously wrong’ is the standard that was put forth in the cases about overturning precedents. So they are using the language of the cases that have been approved by the Supreme Court and members of the current court,” Kneeland said. “I think that’s a smart move on their part. It sounds more inflammatory than it is, because that’s just the language of the cases.”
In its argument against Grutter, SFFA’s lawyers cited Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh’s legal decision in the 2020 case Ramos v. Louisiana case.
“Legally speaking, Grutter has no foundations, ‘[g]iven how unmoored it was from the start,’” the petition quotes Kavanaugh.
The petition also cites Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in Fisher v. University of Texas that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause prohibits the use of race in higher education admissions.
“‘[E]very time the government places citizens on racial registers and makes race relevant to the provision of burdens or benefits, it demeans us all,’” the petition quotes Thomas.
In its critique of the educational benefits of a diverse student body identified in Grutter, SFFA quotes Justice Samuel A. Alito, Jr.’s 2016 opinion in the Fisher case.
“‘This is affirmative action gone wild,’” the petition quotes Alito.
By including their previous arguments, SFFA is directly appealing to justices who have articulated their opposition to the use of race in college admissions.
Oppenheimer said based on past cases, he believes three of the nine justices are “very clearly opposed” to affirmative action.
“That’s Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito,” Oppenheimer said.
Several legal experts said they believe it is likely the Supreme Court will accept SFFA’s petition, which requires at least four of the nine justices to agree to hear the case.
“My first inclination is to tell you that it is a fool’s errand to ever attempt to predict with any purported certainty what the Supreme Court is likely to do,” Shaw said. “But it would be similarly foolish to ignore the fact that there’s been a change on the Supreme Court. This is the most conservative Supreme Court that I’ve seen, certainly, in my lifetime.”
Kneeland said the recently appointed conservative justices — Kavanaugh, Neil M. Gorsuch, and Amy V. Coney Barrett — are more likely to rule in favor of SFFA due to their strict interpretation of the Constitution.
“Most of the justices who are new have, in one way or another, implied – if not stated – that they don’t agree with so-called affirmative action,” Kneeland said. “They also are, many of them, originalists, and there’s a very strong appeal to originalism in this petition.”
Should the Supreme Court accept the petition, Oppenheimer said most legal experts following the case agree that the Court will rule in favor of SFFA. Still, the outcome remains “somewhat unpredictable,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Prominent Harvard Law School professors Randall L. Kennedy, Martha L. Minow, and Cass R. Sunstein recently founded The American Journal of Law and Equality, a publication committed to investigating equality — and the lack thereof — in American society.
The journal will publish annually and the three professors will edit each issue, a distinction from most law reviews, which are traditionally edited by students.
Minow — who is a University professor, the highest faculty honor at Harvard — said the idea originated from Sunstein, another University professor who is currently on leave from the Law School serving as senior counselor in the Biden administration’s Department of Homeland Security.
Minow added she and her colleagues felt “strongly” that the journal should focus on the United States and that it “actually bridges theory and practice.”
Kennedy said civic unrest that spread throughout America over the summer inspired the professors to found the journal.
“People knew about various inequities in American life, but it certainly put the spotlight in an especially poignant way on various inequities in our society,” Kennedy said. “You had the pandemic, you had the continuing and highly publicized episodes of police malfeasance, often racist police malfeasance, the reaction to that in the eruption of protests all over the country. And all of this is going on in the shadow of the impending election.”
The journal’s first issue, which is expected to be released this summer, will feature essays responding to aspects of Harvard Government professor Michael J. Sandel’s recent book entitled “The Tyranny of Merit: What’s Become of the Common Good?” The three co-founders will also contribute an article each.
Sandel wrote in an emailed statement that he was “deeply grateful” to the co-founders of the journal for making his book the “subject of a symposium in the inaugural issue.” The book argues that despite meritocracy’s appeal, it has contributed to inequality in society and fueled backlash against elites.
“The editors have enlisted an all-star cast of 14 scholars of differing perspectives to respond to the book,” Sandel wrote. “I look forward to responding to their essays, and learning from them.”
Kennedy said he was inspired to launch the journal to contribute to the conversation started by preexisting publications.
“All of the editors have written for all sorts of publications, and all of us feel gratitude and admiration,” Kennedy said. “Part of that gratitude and administration prompts me to, in a sense, emulate what they’re doing.”
Kennedy said the journal is soliciting work from a diverse spectrum of individuals beyond legal scholars and academics.
“Law professors are certainly very welcome, but so are political scientists, so are sociologists, so are anthropologists, so are philosophers, so are people who are outside of academia,” Kennedy said. “Our pages are open to thoughtful commentary, whatever the source of that commentary.”
Sandel said the journal’s founding was both timely and necessary, and described his colleagues as optimal scholars to lead the nascent publication.
“At a time when issues of equality and inequality demand new thinking, launching this journal is an inspired idea,” Sandel wrote. “The three founding editors are ideally equipped to bring multiple voices into dialogue — from the legal academy and beyond.”
Kennedy said he hopes the journal will, over time, make “interesting, provocative, useful, illuminating” observations about the state of equality.
“I can’t help but think it’s a good thing when people get together, pool their efforts, and try to bring the world thoughtful discussion about subjects,” he said. “As far as I’m concerned, you can’t get enough of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the final months of 2020, Harvard Management Company sold its shares in multiple major technology companies, including Google’s Alphabet, Inc., and made new investments in others, like Microsoft, while maintaining portfolio growth from the previous quarter.
In the third quarter, the value of HMC’s public securities soared, increasing by nearly 55 percent. At the close of the fourth quarter, which ran from Oct. 1 to Dec. 31, the value had grown about an additional one percent, to over $1.84 billion.
HMC reported the figure in its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which requires investment managers who oversee more than $100 million to disclose public securities holdings each quarter.
HMC jettisoned all its shares in three technology companies in which it previously held significant shares — Alphabet, Inc., the parent company of Google; Uber Technologies; and Intercontinental Exchange. They were valued at around $230 million, $99 million, and $116 million, respectively, at the end of the third quarter.
HMC also significantly reduced its shares in two other technology firms, Facebook and Palo Alto Networks. The share reductions — by around 63 percent and 77 percent, respectively — came after an increase in shares in the third quarter. At the end of the fourth quarter, its holdings in Facebook were valued at around $111 million; its holdings in Palo Alto Networks were valued at around $59 million.
Though it abandoned some companies, HMC made new investments in others — including a major investment in Microsoft Corp., valued at around $182 million at the end of 2020.
At various points in the fourth quarter, financial analysts noted reductions in the value of the company’s share price. On Oct. 8, for example, Forbes noted that share price was down 8 percent in the last month.
Harvard also bought almost one million shares, valued at $206 million, in Salesforce, a software company that specializes in customer relationship management.
John M. Longo — a professor at Rutgers Business School and the Chief Investment Officer for the Beacon Trust — wrote in an email that the University’s new holdings in Microsoft and Salseforce are “excellent long-term prospects.”
“There are two new sizeable positions in HMC's public equity portfolio, Salesforce and Microsoft, with 11.2% and 9.9% portfolio weights at the end of 2020, respectively,” Longo wrote. “They are blue-chip software companies with excellent long-term prospects, so I wouldn’t be too concerned with their high weights.”
Other new acquisitions included Twilio, a cloud communications platform; Progyny, a fertility benefits manager; and the Carlyle Group, a private equity and asset management firm.
Royalty Pharma, a pharmaceutical company, remained as HMC’s largest investment, now valued at around $735 million — almost 40 percent of the public portfolio. Though HMC did not purchase additional shares in the fourth quarter, the value of its existing 14,690,780 shares increased by almost 19 percent.
“HMC’s biggest public equity position remains Royalty Pharma, which had a very successful IPO last year,” Longo wrote.“I would expect them to reduce this weight over time as the lockup expiration occurs.”
A lockup period is the predetermined amount of time after an initial public offering, or IPO, in which large shareholders are prohibited from selling their shares. The lockup period for Royalty Pharma, which had its IPO in June, was set to expire mid-December.
HMC also added shares in five other biopharmaceutical companies: AbCellera Biologics, Praxis Precision Medicines, Kinnate Biopharma, Seres Therapeutics, and Gemini Therapeutics.
Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for HMC, declined to comment on the filings, citing its policy not to comment on individual investments.

My passport probably thinks I’m dead. Yes, you read that right. I have a brand new shiny passport gathering dust in a file somewhere in my closet. As an international freshman, my feet have yet to step on Cambridge soil — the closest I’ve been to Harvard is through Snapchat stories during Virtual Visitas. So naturally, instead of spending my Saturday night doing a math pset due the next day, I spent two hours Google Earth-ing Harvard Yard. I even went on a virtual tour of Harvard’s campus. So whether it's going on a coffee date or procrastinating another assignment, here are some cool and interesting places at Harvard to visit, you know, virtually.
The Harvard Arts Museum
The Harvard Arts Museum is one of the 14 Harvard museums around campus. The museum offers live virtual student guide tours, which are interactive tours led by fellow Harvard students in a variety of disciplines. These 30-minute tours are offered each Thursday and Saturday and are free to all students. Other really interesting exhibits are the world famous pigment collections, (yes, it’s literally watching paint dry but like, it’s ~art~) and the Japanese fans from the special exhibition Painting Edo. Other fun interactive activities include the Ancient Egypt colouring book (I know, mind blown) and take cutesy courses in sculpting, pottery, and even leaf decoration. If you’re into photography, art collection, art history, or just beautiful paintings, this is definitely a place you should check out.
Widener Library
Ever heard of a Lamonster? No? Yeah, me too. Lamonsters are the poor, unfortunate souls who pull all-nighters at Lamont Library (and according to Google, also the name of a garage in Missouri). While I regularly pull all-nighters to attend club meetings and office hours (gotta love that time difference), I do it in the comfort of my home. We may not be on campus to experience Lamont, but maybe we can try to recreate that stressed student aesthetic at Widener.
Widener Library offers a 360 degree virtual tour of the library using thousands of photographs of Widener. The tour offers really cool views from skylights of the Loker Reading Room to the personal collection and bookshelves of Harry Widener. Grab a few friends, daresay your blockmates and explore the architecture and history of Widener. Widenerster anyone?
The Harvard Museums of Science & Culture 
STEM and Social Sciences people, this one’s for you. The Harvard Museums of Science and Culture includes the Collection of Historic Scientific Instruments, the Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Ancient Near East and the Peabody Museum of Archeology. With four different museums under one, there is something for everyone. The museums offer programs at the intersection of science, culture, history and art through virtual tours of their galleries and exhibitions. From presentations such as “Black Is Queen” to “What Spiders Have to Say” to “Dia de los Muertos,” you’ll definitely get the opportunity to learn a lot about Harvard spaces.
With all these options, you have no reason not to plan out a solo museum date, Zoom hangout with friends or Zoom date and get to know campus a little better. Go forth and explore!
