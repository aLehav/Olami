After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“ARMS,” the latest album of Dublin-based band Bell X1, expresses wistful sentiments through a collection of dreamy if inconsistent melodies and sound effects. In “Take Your Sweet Time,” the band alludes to their nearly two decades of experience, proclaiming, “You haven’t heard it all / Till you’re 40 years old.” The rockers, around their 40s now, are veterans in their field: They are the band with the second most airplay in Ireland after U2. Despite the group’s continued success, much of the music on “ARMS” is inevitably tied to an evocative longing for the past. Their music does not sound like that of ambitious twentysomethings commencing a career; appropriately, it feels distinctly reflective, wise, and self-aware.
This insight is evident on “The Upswing,” a slow ballad that proclaims, “One day we’ll meet trouble halfway.” The powerful revisionism of nostalgia is exhibited in “Fake Memory,” where X1 sing, “Fake memory / Telling me what I want to hear.” The conflicting nature of the reality of the X1’s past and their perception of it affects their outlook on the future. The synths that accompany the phrase are similarly fleeting to the past that they envision abandons the present.
Another engaging lyrical theme of the album is the alarming ability of electronic technology to interrupt X1’s vision of reminiscence. The sixth track, “Sons & Daughters,” deals with modern-day distractions, namely television, and asks what will be made of us in a thousand years. X1 croon, “All my distant sons and daughters / I hope you can forgive yourselves and I hope you forgive me / ... There were too many distractions, too much good TV.” Similarly, an amusingly specific mention of some person “playing Stickman Golf on his phone” occurs in “Bring Me a Fire King.” Bell X1 preach continuously throughout the album that we must live in the present and connect with each other. However, the musical direction is less uniform than the lyrical content.
Many signature elements of X1’s musical style—layered vocals in octaves, general propensity for major key, and bouncy guitar sounds—are present in the majority of the songs. Pace, however, varies dramatically and (at times) awkwardly. The opening track, “Fail Again, Fail Better,” is a fast-paced highlight, the energy of which is not quite emulated in any of the following songs. Its rapid development from a fading intro to a boisterous climax is aided by its brisk beat. It is exactly two-and-a-half minutes in duration. Conversely, “The Upswing” is twice as long, and “Take Your Sweet Time” takes its own advice, clocking in at 7:15. These leisurely tracks, which take minutes to develop, are the stylistic median of the album, as compared to “Fail Again” or “Out of Love.” The latter is the only truly funky track, involving a bluesy piano that emulates the decay of previous feelings. While these outliers are enjoyable, they feel somewhat misplaced within the greater context of “ARMS.”
Nonetheless, the group’s maturity is evident and compensates for other stylistic flaws; when considered as a sum of diverse approaches to communicate an emotion, their nine-song ninth release is 90 percent effective.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine your sage grandmother telling sentimental stories from her youth to lull you to sleep as a child. That, in essence, is what Mary Oliver’s “Upstream” accomplishes. The nostalgic tone throughout the text, with frequent interruptions of quirky idiosyncrasies, imbues the book with a sense of familiarity that fortifies Oliver’s arguments. Unlike a grandmother’s stories, however, “Upstream” is a collection of short essays divided into five formal sections. Each section’s essays relate to one another, sometimes so directly that they seem to converse with one another. Sometimes one section explains another; generally, though, the sections are rather disjoint. The five sections each have their own personality and purpose but work together to accomplish the book’s goal of reviving humanity’s love of nature while concurrently elucidating Oliver’s identity as a writer.
The first section is misleading in a way; it lures in a broad audience who can sympathize with Oliver as an artist in search of herself. The second section is a nice bit of prose to cuddle up with in bed, but only because it is boring enough to put you to sleep: It contains three essays primarily devoted to categorical descriptions of sea-life, and Oliver must have written the third section with only English majors and fellow writers in mind. She discusses a few of her literary inspirations, all 18th century poets, and provides a brief biography of each of them. While she is analytical and proposes a few nuanced interpretations of their work, Oliver generally approaches these poets with too much reverence to say anything critical about them. Therefore, the four essays in section three grow tiresome as she merely praises the dead white male poets, an experience reminiscent of a dogmatic high school experience. Section four returns to the topic of animal life, but in a much more captivating manner. This section teems with emotion and nostalgia to elicit a sense of empathy from Oliver’s reader. Finally, section five concludes “Upstream” by contrasting the simpler times of Oliver’s home, Provincetown, with the current state of the city as “a place to visit or lie for a while, and to spend money.” Economic struggles in the city robbed it of life and relegated the once-quaint town to a tourist attraction. Since Oliver invites her reader’s imagination to her pleasant New England sanctuary throughout the first four sections, even readers who have never heard of Provincetown will lament its loss in section five.
One cannot discuss “Upstream” without mentioning Oliver’s relationship to nature. Oliver conveys a sense of solitude throughout the book, with the exception of two instances in which she mentions her late partner, Molly Malone Cook (referred to as M. in “Upstream”). Consequently, Oliver engages with nature alone and seems to be the only human interacting with nature in a nondestructive way. When she discusses her time spent in forests, at beaches, or strolling around ponds, it is as if she is whispering to her readers alluring secrets about the life of nature. At times, Oliver’s meditation is extremely effective, such as in her essay “Swoon,” where she describes the forgotten miracle of spider-web making. She magnifies the spider’s microcosm that exists in her stairwell and humanizes the spider in order to underscore oneness within with the natural world. In “Swoon,” Oliver essentially attempts to dismantle the man-made hierarchy that suggests our species should reign above all others. At times, however, Oliver’s description of nature goes into exhaustive and unnecessary detail. The second section drags on for longer than necessary and only contains a few quick moral lessons to provide the section with a small bit of importance.
Oliver makes up for the lack of universally-interesting topics with her unparalleled writing style. “Upstream” demonstrates her background in poetry with its lyrical and descriptive style. Lines such as “the steamy river of dreams” allow the reader to sink into the imagery of the book as if it were one lengthy poem. Additionally, Oliver’s wise aphorisms throughout the book endow “Upstream” with a heightened sense of importance; the book does not consist of merely pretty words but rather words to live by. [Oliver also often ends her essays with a pithy and distinctive phrase such as “Attention is the beginning of devotion” and “The universe is full of radiant suggestion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As an unprecedented strike heads into its third week, Harvard’s dining service workers have begun to make progress in a months-long contract stalemate with the University.
In an email to Faculty Deans, Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba wrote that there were “hopeful signs of progress” at a negotiation session between Harvard and its dining hall workers on Thursday.
Thimba also wrote that when the strike ends, dining halls will not return to business as usual immediately.
“Without wanting to generate irrational exuberance that a settlement is imminent, HUDS would like you to know (and begin to socialize with students) that when the strike ends, it will take up to 2 business days to clean and restock all the kitchens, reintegrate staff, and be ready to return to normal operations,” Thimba wrote.
Several dining halls that have closed during the duration of the strike have held unofficial brain breaks funded by various House groups, like the House Committee and tutors.
“These appear to be going well and have enlivened dining halls in Houses where meals are not being served,” Thimba wrote.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga said Harvard and Local 26 are continuing negotiations. She declined to comment further.
Brian Lang, president of the Boston-based union representing Harvard’s dining workers, UNITE HERE Local 26, wrote in an emailed statement that “while Harvard has slowly moved in our direction during our discussions, our core issues remain unresolved.” 
Still, his comments represent a slight shift in the tone of the negotiations, as the union’s lead negotiator, Michael Kramer, indicated earlier this month that there is “no middle ground” on issues of health care and wages—the two most polarizing topics of discussion during this round of contract talks.
In particular, Harvard and the union have disagreed about wage increases and health  benefits for the HUDS workers. The union has resisted any change to the existing health care plan for HUDS employees; it also demanded that Harvard extend year-round work to its employees, and that those employees who accept it receive a “minimum guaranteed salary” of $35,000. Currently, Harvard estimates that average dining worker’s salary is near $34,000, though the union disputes that figure.
Dining halls across campus closed for undergraduates for the duration of the strike, limiting dining options for thousands of students. The University recruited volunteers and hired temporary workers to supplement the labor shortage.
As the strike has progressed, HUDS’s protests have escalated from initial picketing and chants, and last Friday Cambridge police arrested 11 individuals at a rally in Harvard Square, including two union leaders and nine HUDS employees, who were blocking traffic in Harvard Square in protest of the negotiations.
Local 26 members and supporters are marching Saturday afternoon starting in Cambridge Common, while Head of the Charles—a regatta that draws hundreds of thousands of people to the Boston area—takes place at the river. According to Thimba’s email, Local 26 indicated to the Cambridge Police Department that the union expects about 1,500 people to march.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: October 22, 2016, at 9:12 p.m.
About a thousand people from across New England marched  in support of Harvard’s dining services employees from Cambridge Common down Massachusetts Avenue late Saturday afternoon, stopping traffic as they headed toward City Hall.
The protests began with a rally at the Science Center Plaza shortly before 3 p.m., after which HUDS supporters gathered in Cambridge Common. There, members of UNITE HERE Local 26—the Boston union that represents HUDS workers—used a makeshift stage in the back of a flatbed truck to address the growing crowd of supporters. HUDS employees, students, and other Local 26 members spoke at the rally before the group marched through Harvard Yard and onto Massachusetts Ave., where both lanes of traffic were stopped. The march ended with a rally on the steps of Cambridge City Hall.
Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick said “this was the largest rally yet, and since they walked all the way to City Hall it was a bit different to plan for.”
Speakers at the rally included UNITE HERE Local 26 President Brian Lang,  women employees arrested in last week’s protest, Teamsters Local 25 President Sean O’Brien, members of SEIU Local 615, and undergraduate and graduate students. Supporters from colleges across the Boston area, including Tufts, Northeastern, UMass Boston, and MIT marched with HUDS employees and union representatives from cities down the East Coast.
Protesters marched Saturday as representatives from Local 26 continue tense, ongoing contract negotiations with the University. On Thursday, Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba wrote in an email to Faculty Deans that there were “hopeful signs of progress” in negotiations that day.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in a statement that “Harvard deeply values the contributions of its dining services employees.”
“Over the past four months, Harvard has been committed to working with Local 26 in good faith to reach a new agreement that recognizes our colleagues’ important contributions,”  deLuzuriaga wrote, indicating that the University had extended a new health benefits plan to HUDS employees that would cut deductibles, increase copayments, and create a new premium contribution salary tier.
Nicole M. Joseph, a student from the Tufts University Labor Coalition, attended the rally with at least nine other students in the group. Janitors at Tufts have been in contract negotiations similar to HUDS’s, Joseph said.
“In my time in the university setting, it has been clear how higher education institutions don’t treat their workers well. This is something we see on our campus and here at Harvard as well,” Joseph said.
Diana St. Mark, a University of Hartford dining employee and member of the Connecticut UNITE HERE Local 217, said food services contract negotiations are also underway at her university and other colleges across the state.
“This rally gives us the ability to see that it’s not just us. If they’re under attack, we’re under attack,” St. Mark said.
Students from Wesleyan University and Yale University also attended the rally. Spencer A. Brown, a member of Wesleyan’s United Student Labor Action Coalition, said he came in support of HUDS “especially since there are negotiations across Connecticut now.”
Warnick said the department was “of course well aware of the plan and the riot before hand.”
Their march comes the same weekend as the Head of the Charles Regatta, the world’s largest two-day rowing event held in Cambridge, which this year was expected to draw 400,000 attendees. In planning for the rally, Warnick said “there were certainly some contingency plans in place” in case the regatta was disrupted.

Maybe you spent your new founded cash doing all of the laundry you procrastinated completing until now. Maybe you used it responsibly printing all your resumes and CVs for interviews. But there is the off chance you might have not touched your Crimson Cash at all since getting that $25 last Saturday and then, oh wait…$50 more today. Don’t know where to spend it? Still unsure what can you get for your money? Let us guide you in making smarter, more productive decisions in spending what you have.
Tanjore: There are a bunch of restaurants nearby the Dunkin Donuts on JFK. One of these hidden places that appears right next to the IHOP (yes, we also have an IHOP near the Square, get with it) is Tanjore, which serves regional Indian cuisine. Enjoy the 9.95 lunch buffet available 7 days a week. You might only be able to get food at the place declared “Best of Boston 2003” for a week at most, but it’s worth it to explore a whole new side of the Square.
Qdoba/Boloco: For when you remember that Chipotle or Felipe’s don’t currently take Crimson Cash, but you still want to stuff your face with Massachusetts's best attempts at Mexican food. At Boloco, a big bowl costs 8.99 while a mini burrito cost 4.49 and you have a chance to travel the world with your taste buds with flavors like “cajun,” tikka masala“ or “bangkok thai.” Qdoba always offer the game changer of free toppings. Either way, you may get more bang for your Crimson bucks.
Liquiteria: If the Crimson Cash machine starts working again, why not enjoy this smoothie place and the bragging rights that you’re eating healthy. Indulge in the $8.50 “coffee-n-cacao” for a little pep in your step. Or maybe the 6.50 “hangover cure” tomorrow morning.
Henrietta’s Table: Located in the Charles Hotel, Henrietta’s Table might not be a first pick for you. But maybe you like the finer things in life and one to indulge in one good dish. Not a meal of course, but a dish. Entrees for ‘supper’ start at 17 dollars. Maybe it would be more fulfilling to just buy multiple starters starting at 7.00. If you want to go all out, why not use the full $50 you got today for all you can eat brunch on Sunday? It’s not a Veritas waffle, but it should do you over.
CVS: Oh yes, CVS. With two locations in the square, it wouldn’t be too hard to buy greek yogurt or multiple VOSS waters. You can get anything you put your mind to. Why not get Halloween started early and buy all the candy you will swear you will share with your friends? You may also delight yourself in multiple pints of ice cream after a midterm, an interview, or just life in general. Because of the 24/7 access, don’t be surprised if you use your extra Crimson Cash to find yourself at 3 am buying an item you most likely don’t need that much.
Sami’s Wrap n Roll: It’s great if you’re an undergrad who constantly goes to the medical school to work on some cure to a dangerous disease or research for your thesis. Otherwise, you don’t need to go there.
