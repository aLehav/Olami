After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With more than two million people affected worldwide, the novel coronavirus is exposing social inequities. In a study of COVID-19 and youth, about 90 percent of infected children developed mild to moderate symptoms while only 0.6 percent suffered more severe complications. Yet true to the theme of exacerbated inequality, some populations of youth are at a higher risk than this overall average would suggest.
Compared to other children, children in the juvenile justice system are disproportionately more likely to have compromised immunity, asthma, and other underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk for developing acute coronavirus complications. While there has been much attention paid to different vulnerable populations in our society, juvenile detainees, as usual, are often left out of the conversation.
There are an estimated 43,000 juveniles in detention centers around the country today. Housed in sometimes squalid, overcrowded conditions, this population is particularly vulnerable to the threats posed by the COVID-19. Lawyers are advocating for the immediate release of these children and for changes in detention centers’ operation. To avoid a calamity, these changes need to happen now.
Consider Houston, where Harris County Juvenile Detention Center officials reported over three weeks ago that a teenager in the facility had tested positive for COVID-19. Now inside confined facility walls, the virus will likely spread like wildfire. In some juvenile jails, detainees share communal bathrooms and eating areas, making it even easier for the virus to spread. College dorms pose a similar issue and Harvard students were sent home to avoid the need for similarly close contact. In prisons, typical prevention strategies, such as washing or sanitizing hands, are of little use, as these teenagers may not have access to soap and hand sanitizer is considered contraband. With such dire conditions, juvenile detention centers have already become major hotspots for coronavirus.
Juvenile detainees are also disproportionately affected by mental health issues, and family visits remain a vital source of their social and emotional support. As prisons across the country suspend visits, they lose face to face contact with their parents and family. This will have a detrimental impact on the emotional well-being of these children, two-thirds of whom have preexisting mental health issues. The loss of visitation rights also affects parents, who are distraught about losing contact with their kids. Although some detention centers are providing opportunities for contact over video conference in lieu of in-person visits, not all families have access to this technology.
Many states are also suspending critically important educational and rehabilitative programs in juvenile detention facilities. Children involved in the juvenile justice system often have lower literacy levels and most will never graduate from high school. These children need education to help them reintegrate into society and find a job when they are released. Although some detention centers have provided instructional packets for juvenile detainees, it is unclear how education will continue in the long term. Interruptions in their education will exacerbate gaps between these youth and their peers, decreasing the chances of their successful re-entry and further isolating them from their communities. To address these issues, lawyers and civil rights activists have demanded the immediate release of as many children as possible and a temporary reduction or halt in admissions into detention centers.
Despite the urgent need, the response of state juvenile justice systems has been slow and inconsistent. While some states have implemented basic social distancing measures, efforts to release currently detained children or halt the admissions have been variable. While California issued an order that will temporarily halt new admits into the juvenile justice system, Nebraska refused to issue a blanket policy changing the operations of detention centers. And in New York, detainees are suing detention centers for failing to release juveniles — even as dozens of adults are being released from jails.
With a rapidly changing pandemic, the condition of these children remains uncertain. It is evident, however, that if policymakers do not act swiftly and appropriately, the coronavirus will only compound the physical and emotional vulnerability already facing detained youth. Decision-makers should respond similar to Harvard administrators — too much too soon rather than too little too late.

What was the most important event in the history of space exploration?
I’m willing to bet my life savings that most of you chose Apollo 11 — or, more specifically, the exact moment in 1969 when Neil Armstrong placed his left foot on the surface of the Moon. But, of all the breakthroughs in space science over the past century, why pick that particular leap? Why not, say, the moment in 1959 that the Soviet Luna 2 probe became the first man-made object to ever touch another celestial body?
We attach a special significance to a human’s warm, fleshy feet touching down on another world, rather than the cold aluminum of a robotic explorer. Many space enthusiasts can’t wait for us to “get to Mars” — ignoring the fact that probes and rovers have been rolling around the Red Planet for decades. We naturally want to see our own likeness exploring the depths of space; for most of us, robots just don’t cut it.
But a human-centric mindset for space exploration is flawed. While I share the desire to see humans ultimately set foot on other planets, we must accept the reality that unmanned exploration is safer, cheaper, and more effective overall. If we want to advance science and satisfy our curiosity, robots are the way to go.
Space exploration has long been understood as a dangerous endeavor. The Challenger and Columbia Space Shuttle disasters gave humanity a grim reminder that small mistakes can have heartbreaking consequences. In fact, it has been estimated that our human space programs have resulted in “well past 150” deaths overall. Even if space technology gets safer over time, we can never be prepared for every potential accident. So, as long as manned space missions continue, some percent of those involved will die.
Sending robots to do our dirty work would drastically reduce the threat to human life. Well-built machines can handle conditions that would be fatal to a human — and, even if a terrible accident rips our robo-friend into pieces, we need not mourn for very long. (If we ever develop a sentient A.I. like HAL 9000, we’ll likely have an obligation to protect its life, but those days are far off.)
Unmanned space exploration would not only save lives, but money as well. Much of the time and expense that goes into building spacecraft is dedicated to making each craft as safe as possible for human passengers. Unmanned missions don’t have these same concerns. Without the need to invest in life-support systems (or the fuel to launch those heavy systems into space), robotic missions are far cheaper on average. The Curiosity rover has cost NASA about 2.5 billion dollars, and the next rover mission will carry a similar price tag; on the other hand, estimates on the cost of a human Mars program range from 100 billion to 1 trillion dollars.
Of course, there are some activities that humans do better than robots. Even the smartest probe has difficulty distinguishing between a geologically-useful sample and a relatively useless one; well-trained astronauts can do this with ease. Similarly, Mars rovers are quite slow, taking a day to perform a task that a human could complete in “less than a minute.” For now, humans remain much more skilled at carrying out science than our robot companions.
At the same time, certain tasks can only be accomplished via unmanned missions. Take, for example, Breakthrough Starshot, an initiative announced in 2016 which seeks to explore and photograph the Alpha Centauri star system with tiny spacecraft traveling at 20 percent the speed of light. At this speed, the spacecraft can reach Alpha Centauri — our nearest star — in about 20 years.
A human mission will never be able to travel anywhere near this fast. As the laws of physics indicate, only low-mass objects can be accelerated to a significant fraction of the speed of light. Tiny probes satisfy this condition, but manned rockets are notoriously massive; each rocket must carry a variety of systems to keep its fragile human passengers alive. Unless modern physics is mistaken (which is always a possibility), it would take many many centuries for a human mission to ever reach another star system. So, if we ever want to get an up-close look at distant stars and planets, we will need to send robots.
Of course, I would be remiss if I ignored the ideological benefits of human space exploration. Humans feel a sense of collective pride when we see a member of our species set foot on another celestial body. This pride is one of the primary factors motivating space exploration (whether we admit it or not), and robots will never be able to satisfy it. Furthermore, in recent decades, human space missions have played a major role in fostering international collaboration; it is unlikely that unmanned missions can have the same unifying effect.
So, I certainly encourage space agencies to keep up their human programs. But, like it or not, humans will need to play a backseat role to machines in the coming decades of space exploration. If we want to advance science as safely, cheaply, and efficiently as possible, it’s time that we welcome our new robot overlords.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay said in an interview Thursday that a multitude of reviews and administrator searches underway across the FAS remain on schedule, despite the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Gay said the ongoing study of the culture and structure of Harvard’s athletics department, which she announced last September, is still on track to release a public report this semester, though the measures Harvard took in mid-March to ramp down operations due to COVID-19 briefly paused the review.
“In the immediate aftermath of the de-densification, it was a singular focus on executing that. But work around the athletics study quickly resumed, and we are fully on track on the original timeline,” Gay said.
Harvard commissioned the study in light of the centennial of the department’s founding, which will occur in 2026, Gay said in an October interview. She denied that the study was related to the controversy surrounding former head fencing coach Peter Brand, who Harvard fired last July after he sold his home to the family of a prospective student for $300,000 above its assessed value.
Another high-profile FAS review — an examination of the tenure promotion process — also remains on schedule, Gay said Thursday.
“I still just this week have already had meetings with groups of department chairs to talk about the planning for that review,” Gay said.
Gay agreed to launch the review in December, a few days after more than 100 faculty wrote to her demanding such an action. She told faculty she would fully define the scope of the review over the course of this spring before assembling a committee and formally launching the review in the fall.
Though the faculty cited the tenure denial of Lorgia García Peña — who researches race and ethnicity — as a reason the review is necessary, it will not examine individual tenure cases, Gay said in March.
Though the review will continue, FAS indefinitely suspended its search for faculty specializing in ethnic studies in late March, following the de-densification of campus. Several weeks later, Harvard administrators announced a University-wide hiring freeze, alongside other cost-cutting measures, as the pandemic drew heavily on the University’s coffers.
Searches for two new FAS administrators, meanwhile — an Athletics Director and a dean of the Division of Continuing Education — are still moving forward despite the hiring freeze, according to Gay. She said she hopes to select a new Athletics Director by the end of the semester.
The FAS will continue to fill “all essential curricular needs” during the hiring freeze, including time-capped non-tenure-track faculty positions, according to FAS spokesperson Rachael Dane.
The appointments of some lecturers and preceptors will expire this June, and those who have reached time caps will not be able to return to the University. More than 1,200 people have signed a petition urging Harvard to extend the time caps for those faculty by at least a year due to the pandemic.
Beyond her own administration’s ongoing searches and reviews, Gay declined to comment on another ongoing review the University’s central administration is making into one of the FAS’s professors, former Chemistry department chair Charles M. Lieber.
Harvard announced the investigation and placed Lieber on paid administrative leave in late January after he was charged in federal court with failing to disclose funding from the Chinese government.
Administrators have repeatedly declined to specify the scope of that investigation or its timeline.
Though the FAS canceled its April faculty meeting over “insufficient business ready for action,” Gay said faculty meetings will resume as normal in May. Gay added that administrators have been holding “town halls or open office hours” for faculty and staff to come together and share ideas about working remotely.
“Faculty meeting is part of the FAS governance process,” Gay said. “We are still the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, so those will continue.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council adopted a policy order April 13 to consider the closure of Memorial Drive to cars in an effort to create more space for residents to exercise and encourage safe social distancing outside.
The policy order asks City Manager Louis A. DePasquale to work with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation to explore closing the road along the Charles River until the end of the statewide stay-at-home advisory.
Councilor Patricia M. Nolan said cities across the country — from Brookline, Mass. to Oakland, Calif. — have already implemented similar measures restricting certain streets to pedestrians.
She pointed to the success of a DCR pilot project in early April which closed three major streets in the Boston-area to vehicles.
“They had no problems and no complaints,” Nolan said of the pilot project. “This weekend’s weather was quite nice, and yet the streets were not overcrowded. There were not the gatherings that one might have worried about.”
Laure Astourian, a Cambridge resident, called into the April 13 Council meeting to support the policy order, saying she has encountered a growing number of crowds on walks around her neighborhood.
“It’s like playing a game of Pac-Man on the sidewalks,” Astourian said. “I end up walking in the middle of the street and then, of course, cars come. But, really, we don’t have much of a choice.”
Another Cambridge resident, Yonah Freemark, directed the Council’s attention to the city’s population density, noting that many Cambridge residents live in apartments and do not own a car.
“Cambridge is desperately in need of more space for its pedestrians and bicyclists,” Freemark said. “The idea that allowing pedestrians to walk in the street will cause more crowds is specious. Why is it acceptable to allow drivers to continue using the streets as if nothing has changed?”
In addition to supporting the closure of Memorial Drive, Freemark also advocated for a related measure that would require city officials to identify other neighborhood streets that could be closed to encourage more social distancing outside.
“If we are worried that too many people will enjoy taking advantage of this outdoor space we might provide them, the answer is not to close off the outdoors,” he said. “It’s the contrary; we should expand outdoor space, such that the risk of crowding is zeroed out.”
The City Council did not take action on that proposal at the April 13 meeting.
Nolan emphasized that, though stay-at-home guidelines remain in place, the city of Cambridge is not barring people from leaving their residences.
“We are not in lockdown,” Nolan said.” Some people think we should be but we are not.”
“This is simply about giving them more space and aligning with the guidelines,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard will name its next Athletics Director by the end of the academic year despite a University-wide hiring freeze implemented in response to the coronavirus crisis.
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said in an interview last week that the committee she tasked with selecting the next Athletics Director will conclude its work on schedule by next month.
Gay launched a nationwide search for the position in November 2019, following Harvard Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise’s announcement that he would retire after almost two decades at the helm of the department.
Since then, however, the global pandemic has drastically altered Harvard’s operations and embroiled the University in a financial crisis.
Harvard has suffered immediate financial losses due to unforeseen expenses and lost streams of revenue. As financial markets crater, the University’s endowment has likely depreciated by billions of dollars.
FAS has incurred over $30 million in losses alone. Gay announced last week she would halt almost all faculty searches following Harvard officials’ decision to institute a salary and hiring freeze across all arms of the University.
Gay noted that the hiring freeze will not impact a “small number” of searches that were well underway by the time of the outbreak – including the selection of the next Athletics Director.
Members of the search committee met with a group of student-athletes at the end of January to learn what they value in an Athletics Director. Student-athletes told the committee members they would like Scalise’s successor to prioritize their concerns and set high standards for the program.
During his more than 40 years at Harvard, Scalise coached the men’s lacrosse team and women’s soccer team and served as Associate Dean and Senior Executive Officer of Harvard Business School.
Scalise confirmed in an interview last week that his tenure as Athletics Director will conclude at the end of the semester. He said he still plans to serve in an advisory role during the 2020-2021 academic year as his successor adjusts to the job.
Whoever the search committee taps, he or she will enter a department dramatically changed by the coronavirus. Spring sports were cancelled, the University is tightening its budget, and plans for the fall semester remain in flux.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The coronavirus upended undergraduates’ semesters, forcing them to vacate campus more than a month ago. Now it has changed their summer plans, too — a shift students are adjusting to as they face expanding disruptions to college life.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Friday interview that though he views the decision to move summer programming online as “disappointing,” it was the only “responsible” path forward.
“We’re doing everything we can right now to work with students and faculty to support them for the planned work they had to see what might be able to be done remotely,” Khurana said. “We are trying to use the summer as an opportunity to continue to allow us to fulfill projects and goals even if we're not on campus.”
Many students hoping to conduct research through Harvard’s various research summer programs have had to rethink their projects.
Harvard College Research Program administrator Elizabeth E. Perten wrote in an email to applicants last week that students awarded funding must submit a revised proposal for remote work, taking into account restrictions on laboratory and archival research, and other research that could require travel.
James Chen ’23, who applied to receive HCRP funding this summer, said he originally planned to live on campus in DeWolfe housing and conduct research at the Broad Institute.
“It’s lab work, so I don’t know what remotely doing that would look like within a new model,” he said. “I already started considering this possibility, because considering how things are, the Broad Institute, as far as I know, is closed at the moment.”
The Program for Research in Science and Engineering — a summer residential research program — also announced last week that it would move to an online format and asked students to submit remote research proposals.
Jeffrey R. Prince ’22, a PRISE fellow, said he expected to live on campus in Winthrop House and conduct research on peroxisomal biogenesis in Northwest Labs and the Denic Lab this summer.
Prince said some projects, such as those that involve computational research, may lend themselves more easily to virtual work than those that require access to labs.
“I’ve been trying to be creative, working with lab mentors to try to figure out how to do the most substantive project possible,” Prince said.
Prince added that PRISE has also maintained its promise of providing participants a stipend and removed its rule that students may only participate in the program once. He said PRISE is planning to hold virtual speaker series and community events for this year’s participants.
“It’s definitely really disappointing that we’re not going to have that residential, on-campus summer community,” he said. “But I’ve been very pleased and happy with the fact that they’ve been really creative and supporting us as well as possible,” Prince said.
Similarly, the Harvard Global Health Institute announced last week that it would only support remote internships this summer.
Christian Malachy Porter ’23 said he applied for research opportunities through the Harvard Global Health Institute’s internship program, which ultimately offered him two positions — one based in South Africa, and the other based in Boston.
Porter said he was thrilled about the prospect of having a research experience across the globe. But after the College vacated its campus and HGHI informed him the status of international internships was tenuous, he decided to accept the local position studying HIV.
“And then I just recently got an email that everything was canceled, and they may or may not be able to give me a remote position,” he said. “I was planning on going to South Africa, and now I’m gonna be sitting at my kitchen table all summer.”
“Missing out on that is definitely upsetting. In terms of the stipend, that also was going to be really nice,” Porter added. “Financial compensation is really important. A lot of people were depending on having these funds to support themselves throughout the school year.”
Porter said he hoped the College would find a way to financially support students barred from doing internships that would have paid them a stipend.
Katrina J. Hon ’22, who will participate in an HGHI program, said she planned to work at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in London over the summer.
She said she is still unsure what a remote format would mean for her program but anticipates that her responsibilities will include researching policy and sitting in on Zoom conference calls.
“I think a big part of why I wanted to go abroad too was to get the office workspace, the office setting experience, but I guess there’s not as much of that now,” she said.
“But I’m excited to still be able to be a part of it and get to meet the people at NICE and the type of work that they're doing,” she added. “It will be cool to get involved in health policy at a time like this.”
Dean of Harvard Summer School Sandra A. Naddaff ’75 announced last week that all Harvard Summer School courses will move to a virtual format.
For students planning to take Summer School courses for College credit, Khurana said the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has approved “select” online courses for credit. In past years, only on-campus summer school courses have been eligible.
Lilliana S. C. Brandão ’22 said she was planning to work as a proctor at the Summer School, while simultaneously working for 20 hours each week at a chemistry lab.
But with Summer School programming moving online, Brandão said she has lost her proctoring job — as well as the free housing and food that accompanies it.
“I wasn’t surprised, but it’s honestly pretty disappointing because leaving and having to go home in the middle of the semester, it made me even more excited to come back for the summer possibly. So that’s something I was still holding on to the hope of being able to do,” she said.
Brandão added that she is grateful she is still able to take a Summer School course free of charge, but noted that “it’s not a source of income.” She said she is currently searching for a remote research position with a stipend.
The College’s decision to move its summer programming online will not only affect students, but also the communities they serve — including through the Summer Urban Program, which operates 10 summer camps in the Greater Boston area.
The Refugee Youth Summer Enrichment Program, one of SUP’s programs, serves recently immigrated teens in the Greater Boston area, welcoming them onto Harvard’s campus for afternoon sessions that build college readiness and prepare them for standardized tests.
Wellesley College student and RYSE co-director Sarai Hertz-Velázquez said the program’s transition online would not prove prohibitively difficult, since Cambridge and Boston public schools provide their students with Chromebooks and hotspots if they cannot afford them.
“In terms of technology, we’re hoping that we’re covered,” she said.
Hertz-Velázquez added that all students hired as senior counselors across SUP would keep their jobs.
“Because we promised them a position and we really wanted to work with them — thought they’d be a great fit for SUP — we still want them to be involved in the process even moving and shifting to an online platform,” she said.
Surveying the summer changes, Khurana said he recognizes service programs like SUP, which thrive on in-person contact, will face added challenges transitioning online.
“I know this causes a lot of challenges during this period, dislocations are significant, but they’re being done with the aim of getting us back to a community that can once again engage in person,” he added.

Second-year Harvard Medical School student Joshua “Josh” J. Ellis ’17 thought he would be delivering babies at this time in April.
When the first few COVID-19 cases appeared at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center — a Medical School teaching hospital — Ellis was in the middle of a surgery rotation. The rotation was part of Ellis’s Principal Clinical Experience: a full year of learning in the hospital for second-year Medical School students.
But after all students were pulled from clinical work due to concerns over the novel coronavirus, Ellis said his experience in cardiac surgery was postponed indefinitely, along with his forthcoming April and May clinical rotations.
Now, instead of completing his OB-GYN rotation, Ellis is finishing up his second year of medical school virtually. He said that for him and his classmates, the disruption has been instructive but profound.
“As medical students, our lives are pretty planned out for a long time, so everything is so routinized for us that it’s tricky when things get a wrench thrown into it,” Ellis said. “I think what we’ve learned and what we’ve realized is that it’s important to be fluid.”
Like students across all 12 of Harvard’s degree-granting schools, Medical School students have transitioned to online courses and, in most cases, moved off campus as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.
But unlike their peers in other parts of the University, these students have spent their time at Harvard studying and practicing the very medical scenarios the nation has seen unfolding during the COVID-19 pandemic. The illness has forced them out of the classrooms and hospitals where they had been training to become healthcare workers, just like their professors and supervisors currently working on the front lines.
Ellis said he recognizes that by the time he and his classmates enter the workforce, their medical training will not be as “cookie cutter clean” as students’ in years past.
“You know, I wish things were different,” Ellis said. “At the same time, I think it’s definitely been important to keep in mind that this is an unprecedented time, and no one really has walked this path before.”
In early March, fourth-year medical student Josephine “Josie” T. C. Fisher started a clinical rotation in the emergency department of Massachusetts General Hospital — another Medical School teaching hospital — to fulfill a capstone course requirement while she prepared to graduate in May.
At the time, the healthcare staff in the MGH emergency room was trying to figure out how to manage suspected COVID-19 patients, according to Fisher, whose arrival at the hospital coincided with that of the first few suspected cases at MGH.
During those early days, MGH put out scores of new policies and procedures “basically every single day” to protect the students working in the hospital, Fisher said.
“We were told immediately in the beginning, ‘Definitely don’t see anyone who is worried about having COVID,’” she said. “It got even more restrictive as time went on, which was totally understandable in their attempt to protect us.”
Students could not see patients who had coughs. As the hospital prepared for an anticipated equipment shortage, they were also barred from entering rooms that required personal protective equipment, or PPE.
After working in the MGH emergency department for only two weeks, Fisher found out that the Medical School was pulling all students from their clinical rotations — leading to the premature end of her final clinical experience as a medical student.
“I think we as students like to be super helpful, and we can play important roles, but we are non-essential personnel,” Fisher said. “Medical care can absolutely be provided without us there.”
Then, the Medical School announced that students whose residency programs needed them to start early would be allowed to graduate early. Fisher — who is staying in Boston after matching to the MGH internal medicine and primary care program — said her program has told its matched students they are “feeling appropriately staffed” so far.
While Fisher said she wishes she could help “right now” and “the best way I can” by getting involved clinically, she also acknowledged it was comforting that MGH was not pressed for resources.
“This to me is just very reassuring that I feel like we’re really lucky here in Boston, that we have these hospitals that are so well-resourced and well-staffed,” Fisher said. “It takes a lot to get us started as new hires, and so the administrative burden of that is a big barrier that they only want to have to deal with if it’s absolutely necessary.”
Along with the disruption of being removed from rotations or having career plans delayed, Medical School students say the disruption has also led to profound shifts in how they conceive of their roles as future doctors.
LaShyra “Lash” T. Nolen — a first-year medical student and the first black woman to serve as president of the Medical School’s Student Council — said in an interview that as students’ days change, she has taken time outside of class to think “on the level of social justice and equity” by considering the many “societal wrongs” the pandemic has revealed and exacerbated.
“I think we see this in who is dying from COVID-19 at rates disproportionately compared to others. And I think we see it in the fact that cashiers and folks who are carriers for the mail, they still have to work. Yet there are other individuals who don’t have to work, and they are able to work from home,” Nolen said.
“This has just really made me think even more deeply about injustice in our society and privilege and how that will impact my patients,” she added. “The pandemic has really exposed America for the unequal space that it is for a lot of people.”
Specifically, Nolen said the way the virus has impacted people of color is “absolutely unacceptable.” She believes working towards degrees in medicine and public policy will give her the tools to address this concern.
“I think that it’s important for me to be able to inform policy and change the rules of our society so that when something like this happens again, these communities have the power to to fight against it and to make sure that they have the tools and the resources to protect themselves,” Nolen said. “As of now, they are completely bare, and they haven’t gotten that support that they deserve and need.”
More broadly, Nolen said that as she continues her training as a medical doctor, the knowledge that doctors are not getting the protection they need during the pandemic will remain “heavy” on her heart and mind as hospitals across the country continue to report protective gear shortages.
“I think the fact that I have professors who are wearing the same PPE all day is absolutely unacceptable,” Nolen said.
“If this happens again, who is going to protect me? And who is going to protect the cafeteria workers and the janitorial staff and all of those individuals who are working alongside me when something like this happens?” she added.
National projects such as #GetUsPPE, a movement started by emergency medicine physicians, have sought to bring awareness to the need for more protective equipment in hospitals.
Third-year medical student Adam L. Beckman joined #GetUsPPE in mid-March, helping to turn the social media hashtag into a petition. That petition “snowballed” into a broader project to document the need for PPE and match groups that have PPE to those that still need it, Beckman said in an interview.
Beckman said he is also involved in covid19bill.org, a policy working group that has published recommendations for national legislation related to coronavirus.
“The recommendations did have, as we understand it, some meaningful impact in terms of what certain congressional offices advocated for, for the first and subsequent stimulus packages,” he said.
Inspired by these nationwide movements, Medical School students founded COVID-19 Student Response, a task force created to coordinate aid between Medical School students and hospitals, on March 15.
The team now has chapters throughout the country, according to its website. Its goals include supporting vulnerable populations and essential health staff, providing educational materials on COVID-19 for fellow medical students and the broader public, and aiding the clinical needs of hospitals through a student workforce.
Medical School Dean for Students Fidencio Saldaña said the “completely student run and directed” efforts have impressed and heartened him.
“This is really outside of the curriculum, outside of any faculty mandate or direction,” Saldaña said. “They’ve really taken it upon themselves to organize students to be able to contribute to the community.”
According to Medical School student Suhas Gondi, virtual efforts like #GetUsPPE, covid19bill.org, and the COVID-19 Student Response task force have inspired many students during a “scary time.”
But as a student who has completed nearly three of his four years at the Medical School, Gondi said he and many of his classmates believe they have enough experience with patient care to be helpful on the front lines. But the inability to join their mentors and colleagues in the hospitals can leave them feeling powerless.
“To be a medical student right now is to be simultaneously energized about the many things that you might be able to do to help out, but also frustrated and helpless about the ways in which we can actually materially contribute,” Gondi said.
Gondi said he has found a way to utilize skills from his clinical training by performing volunteer telemedicine for the Crimson Care Collaborative, a student-faculty collaborative clinic that provides primary care for greater Boston with several in-person clinics.
Though the clinics are now closed for in-person services due to COVID-19, many of the hospitals involved, including MGH and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, are relying on medical and nursing students to reach out to patients who may potentially be infected with the virus.
Under the supervision of an attending physician at BIDMC, Gondi said he called a number of patients who had suggestive symptoms but whose cases could not be confirmed due to limited testing, checking up on them to see how they were handling the illness.
Gondi said the calls revealed to him the bitter reality of what the patients were experiencing. One patient he spoke with had been having symptoms for nearly a month and was still “feeling terrible,” mentally and physically, but had not been able to get tested.
“She was telling me about the progression of her symptoms, but what was so clear was the anxiety in her voice, and the feeling that she understood that tests were limited, and she understood that this is a pandemic that no one had prepared for,” Gondi said. “Even though she’s on the tail end of her illness, she really just felt like she needed an answer whether or not she had COVID.”
It was a “really tough” phone call for both him and the patient, Gondi said.
“It gives you a window into the anxiety and the toll that this pandemic is having on patients, even those who are not hospitalized, are not in ICU, but are safely in their homes,” Gondi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Harvard grapples with the financial consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, Vice President for Finance and Chief Financial Officer Thomas J. Hollister said the University will focus its existing funds on teaching and research.
“The philosophy so far on spending is to stop — apply the tourniquet — and make sure we’re not spending anything for expansion, or for discretionary reasons,” Hollister said in an interview with The Crimson on Thursday.
In recent weeks, Harvard has faced a shrinking endowment and dwindling sources of revenue, which Hollister called “challenging.”
As a result, University President Lawrence S. Bacow, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 announced in an email to University affiliates last Monday that Harvard was instituting an immediate University-wide salary and hiring freeze, canceling or deferring discretionary spending, and potentially deferring all capital projects.
Hollister said deciding what falls into the category of discretionary spending is “a matter of judgment on deciding what is essential spending to maintain the mission of teaching and research.”
“The key focus is making sure we’re spending whatever’s necessary to appropriately keep the mission going,” he said. “Any nice things should be either stopped or deferred.”
Hollister listed various categories of projects that have been halted, including “hiring consultants to study something.”
He also said that any planned capital spending projects — such as improvements to buildings — would be postponed.
“As nice as it would be to continue with capital improvements, that’s something that can be deferred,” Hollister said.
One of the largest capital projects Harvard has taken up in the last decade is its house renewal project. Administrators have announced plans to renovate eight of Harvard’s twelve undergraduate houses, the majority of which date back over 100 years.
As of this year, five of the eight — Leverett, Quincy, Dunster, Winthrop, and Lowell — have undergone full or partial renovations.
The sixth, Adams House, is currently in the middle of a four-year renovation, which began in June 2019. The House is divided into multiple buildings, which are undergoing construction separately.
Hollister said construction work that is currently unfinished “is likely to be restarted and finished” once Cambridge lifts its ban on construction. But the fate of renovations that have not yet begun is less certain.
“Much more likely to be cut is projects that have not yet begun,” he said. “The Faculty of Arts and Sciences needs to assess whether Adams House, for example — once the current building is finished — whether it’s wiser or not to continue to the next phase.”
Hollister declined to approximate a timeframe for decisions on cuts to capital spending, citing the “high degree of uncertainty” in the University’s plans for the fall.
“I think there’s a high degree of uncertainty affecting many activities, frankly, across the world. And this includes businesses, and colleges and universities. Harvard is in — and we’re not alone in this — not knowing what our operating environment will be in the fall, because there’s a great deal of uncertainty,” Hollister said.
Regardless of the situation, Hollister said administrators aim to minimize the impact spending cuts will have on Harvard’s faculty, staff and students.
“Whatever Harvard is, it’s because of its talented faculty and staff and promising students,” he said. “As we examine the different scenarios for the fall, in terms of cuts, the priority will be on non-people.”
Last month, Hollister told the Harvard Gazette that since the “depth and duration” of the coronavirus crisis is unclear, Harvard would “plan and prepare for the worst.”
When asked by The Crimson what the worst-case economic scenario would look like, Hollister paused.
“I’m going to have to think about that,” he said.
After a long silence, he continued.
“I think Harvard is planning for every conceivable scenario we can think of, and we can find a way to carry on with both teaching and research,” Hollister said. “I feel pretty confident we’ll find ways to do that.”

Everyone has a friend or two who is premed, and who — although you love them — never stops talking about it. After a while, you will probably run out of things to say about their real, but too often mentioned, problems. Here are some suggestions for what to say the next time you find yourself listening to their orgo exam woes or medical research venture.
Them: This orgo/chem/LS pset is taking so long and I don’t think I’ll ever finish.
What you used to say : That sucks. At least you started early, and there are still two days before it’s due. Maybe you can go to office hours later?
What you should say : Did you not read the Q-Guide for this class? They all say the psets take forever and I know you’ve been planning on taking this class since the first day of freshman year. Also, I don’t think that telling me about how long your pset is will help you complete it.
Them: I am so stressed about the MCAT. I don’t know what I’m going to do.
What you used to say : I know, standardized testing is the worst. You will do so well though, you are so prepared. Even if you don’t take it right now and wait so you can study more, you can always work in a lab to strengthen your resume.
What you should say : You know you got yourself into this right? You signed up for this the day you decided you actually enjoyed the content of LS1a. You truly played yourself.
Them: Getting into med school is so hard and I only want to go to this [insert incredibly selective school]. I don’t think I will ever get in. 
What you used to say : You’ll get in for sure. You are so smart and have a great resume. Also, gap years are so common these days — it would be such a good experience for you to go work in medicine before you go back to school.
What you should say : Have you considered a different concentration? Folk and Myth? Slavic Literature? I know you want the quickest way to the inside of a hospital, but I don’t think having a stress-induced heart attack and being a patient yourself is the best way to go.
So next time you run into one of your premed friends, remember honesty is the best policy. If anything, you will give them a great story to tell in one of their med school interviews.
