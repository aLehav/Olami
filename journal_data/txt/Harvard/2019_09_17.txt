After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Shopping week has come and gone and students have registered for classes. But some undergraduates may be disappointed that a class they’d planned to take this term is no longer offered. Perhaps they’d wanted to take a particular instructor’s seminar, only to discover that the faculty member left campus in May and never came back. These students are paying the price for Harvard’s counterproductive habit of automatically firing valued instructors. Every year, the University terminates many of its best teachers based on arbitrary time limits set by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Non-tenure-track faculty (lecturers, preceptors, and other instructors) are essential to a Harvard education. We provide all instruction in Expos, offer introductory Math and classes in the School for Applied Sciences and Engineering, run the tutorials for History and Literature and Social Studies, coordinate enormous lecture courses in the Life Sciences, and teach languages from Amharic to Yiddish. Our students clearly value our contributions to undergraduate education (more than 200 of us won awards last semester based on our Q evaluations). But each year, some of Harvard College’s roughly 400 non-tenure-track faculty are kicked out when our “clock” runs out after three to eight years.
Because the administration treats these faculty as disposable, Harvard students lose seasoned teachers every year. For example, Ikue Shingu, a preceptor in Japanese, is scheduled to “time out” this year despite the fact that she has won the Derek Bok Center Certificate of Excellence every semester since the spring of 2013. And back in 2017, Expos said goodbye to Preceptor Kevin Birmingham, who had just one year earlier been awarded the prestigious Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism. Harvard also loses skilled faculty when they leave for more stable positions — such as when History and Literature Lecturer Terry Park left Harvard after just one year to take a non-tenure-track job without time limits at the University of Maryland.
Why does the Faculty of Arts and Sciences summarily dismiss its non-tenure-track faculty, regardless of merit? It’s hard to say. Administrators have offered different rationales over the years. This spring, after 63 teaching award winners signed an open letter asking not to be fired, the administration explained why they purge the ranks of non-tenure track faculty after a set term. They suggested that hiring fresh replacements is the only way to meet changing student interests and offer “novel pedagogical techniques.”
Ten years ago, a faculty committee met to reconsider the time caps. Their final report argued that many non-tenure-track teaching positions “are highly demanding and require regeneration.” The implication is that Harvard demands so much of its lecturers and preceptors that we must be relieved of our duties before we burn out completely. (The committee did not consult any lecturers or preceptors in preparing its report.) We believe that “regeneration” among our ranks should come in the form of increased investment in the excellent faculty who are already here, rather than firing and replacing us. For example, standardized research funding, better parental leave policies, or a pay raise that would match the salaries of our counterparts at Boston University would all be effective ways to support and sustain our teaching.
Another faculty committee met in 2018 and reaffirmed the time cap policy for lecturers. But it was only this spring that we were informed of this committee’s existence. The membership and report of this 2018 committee have not been made available to the lecturers affected, let alone the broader Harvard community. Why is the administration afraid of transparency when it comes to non-tenure-track faculty policies? And why does it exclude us from discussions that determine our fate at this university?
Beyond the College, other parts of Harvard have already realized that they need to treat non-tenure-track instructors better. For instance, this spring, the directors of Harvard’s International Studies Centers jointly recommended that FAS “create a job ladder for talented language teachers, with the goal of ensuring that they can stay at Harvard for the long haul.” Meanwhile, the Kennedy School doesn’t automatically let non-tenure-track faculty go — they offer a path to promotion instead.
Harvard needs to do better by its non-tenure-track faculty. The administration commonly calls our summary dismissal “timing out,” but to us, losing our salary and benefits looks a lot like being fired. And dismissing us from our jobs actively harms the College’s education mission. Undergraduates lose excellent faculty just as soon as those faculty find their footing at this institution. Departments pour money and time into hiring searches to replace teachers whom students don’t want to lose in the first place. Why not invest instead in the experienced and skilled faculty Harvard already has? Dismissing us and shutting out our voices helps no one. Our students deserve better — and so do we.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past few years have been an interesting time to study foreign and defense policy. The “liberal international order” falling apart, great power competition returning, Iran and North Korea seeking nuclear weapons, and the rise of authoritarianism are just a handful of challenges United States national security officials must grapple with.
As global affairs become increasingly more complex, however, few events abroad seem to affect the American citizen. Over these last few weeks, the Hong Kong protests, Boris Johnson’s suspension of British parliament, and the tanker dispute in the Persian Gulf solicited far less attention from news outlets and the general public when comparable events happened in the past. Nowadays, most Americans seem indifferent. Turkey is going to buy the S-400 missile system from the Russians? Too bad. The Venezuelan conflict has no end in sight? What a shame.
Americans of all political persuasions seem intently fixed on what occurs domestically, including Harvard students. Despite being some of the most well-rounded members of our generation, I have seen few Harvard students thoughtfully examine a national security issue, offer their own insights, and suggest a solution. This makes sense. Most polls show that younger Americans are wary of any U.S. foreign intervention — most want to prioritize domestic affairs. Our generation scores low on measures of patriotism, are less confident that U.S. intervention will solve crises, and, in fact, believe that America causes more problems than it solves on the world stage.
These studies correspond with my own experiences. I have heard too often in Harvard’s dining halls and dorm rooms that the U.S. must “stay out” of the world. The remark, “We are not the world’s policeman” is often invoked. But when did caring about domestic affairs and engaging in foreign affairs become mutually exclusive? The two are interconnected. Focusing on American infrastructure or political turmoil will make it a stronger power on the world stage. Conversely, involvement in the world stage improves America’s economic security and moral standing.
Surveys suggest that our generation overwhelmingly supports free trade agreements and humanitarian missions. At the same time, millennials disdain confrontation, intervention, and a strong military. Yet without a strong military or international engagement, America’s influence in trade negotiations or humanitarian operations diminishes. Without its extensively deployed military, the U.S. would not be able to deliver aid during natural disasters or political revolutions. Without American naval fleets patrolling the Persian Gulf regions, more tankers would be seized by Iran, further disrupting trade.
Even if millennials don’t seem to care, American engagement is also critical to national security. Without America’s enhanced forward presence in Eastern Europe, Russia could easily overrun and reclaim the three Baltic nations. Without freedom of navigation missions in the South China Sea, China could augment its harassment of our Pacific allies. Of course, a successful national security is preventive. Without America’s involvement in the world for more than 70 years, one can only imagine what type of conflicts would have succeeded World War II.
I am not arguing that every millennial should believe America must remain the “indispensable” superpower. But millennials, and especially Harvard students (many of whom will be our nation’s future leaders), should study and debate these issues and their histories. Their importance to peace and prosperity demands more reflection.
To make it easier, Harvard should provide more opportunities for students to learn about these issues. It should offer more undergraduate-level classes on foreign policy as well as diplomatic, political and military history. When teaching these classes, teachers should move away from lectures and readings and focus on battlefield staff rides, crisis simulations, and group projects. My favorite course at Harvard has been Kennedy School Professor Fredrik Logevall’s “U.S. Foreign Policy in a Global Age.” In this class, I delivered a 30 minute group presentation on the 1953 Iranian coup, played George Ball in a simulation about increasing U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and debated classmates routinely on today’s biggest issues. Logevall cut his lectures short so we would not just learn the concepts but do them.
Additionally, few debates and discussions on campus — student-run or otherwise — are about foreign policy. The few discussions that do focus on foreign policy are simply that: discussions. There is little debate and negligible distinctions among viewpoints. To remedy this problem, I started a chapter of the Alexander Hamilton Society on Harvard’s campus, which regularly holds debates on foreign policy, economic statecraft, and national security as well as war games, social events, and dinners with scholars and practitioners in these fields.
Most importantly, stay updated on foreign and defense news and, perhaps, continue to read this column.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leverett House residents have not been happy with their Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras. Last week, students flooded the House email list with their displeasure, arguing that the two deans have weakened House culture by restricting access to common spaces and reducing the number of social events held in Leverett.
The revelations that several decisions made by the Leverett deans had the effect of closing off common spaces and tamping down communal life in the House are troubling. We are hopeful that the dialogue fostered by students will serve as a springboard for improvements in the transparency of House decision-making, both within and outside of Leverett.
We commend the Leverett residents who took the initiative to articulate their grievances by creating and contributing to the email chain. We have always supported students in speaking out about issues in their communities. And while the stakes in the case of Leverett are far lower than in past notable controversies surrounding faculty deans — not least among them the criticisms of former Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and his tenure in Winthrop House — we continue to believe that any and all discourse is good.
We are further hopeful that in response to these concerns, the Leverett faculty deans will work assiduously to foster a more vibrant community, as their early efforts to schedule more community events suggest they may.
To that end, we encourage Farrell and Ferreras to review — and ideally reverse — decisions students have cited as poor House management. These include the closure of the Senior Common Room biweekly lunches and the private dining room, the difficulty of booking common spaces, adding locks to the Junior Common Room, and the abolition of sherry hour, among others.
If they conclude that these decisions are defensible, we hope they issue a public explanation of their rationale and work to institute reforms that would foster new House-specific traditions that will help build a close-knit, welcoming, and unique House culture.
More broadly, after the Winthrop House controversy, the outcry of Leverett residents illustrates the need for better channels of communication between students and faculty deans in all houses. Though these events are of entirely different degrees of seriousness, they both point to a systemic failure in communication. When Winthrop was graffitied with anti-Sullivan messages last spring, we urged the College to devise new mechanisms for students to voice concerns about House culture. We find ourselves still waiting.
We encourage the College as well as individual House administrations to brainstorm new forums that allow students to communicate concerns without fear of retribution or punishment. In doing so, administrators should be conscious of the power dynamics at play in students’ relationships with House deans and how those dynamics may negatively impact students’ ability to be honest and engaged.
Houses are meant to exist as smaller, more manageable and nurturing communities on campus. Though many Houses, under praiseworthy leadership, have found individual success in this work, the housing system overall has not necessarily done so. Hopefully, Leverett residents will inspire a renewal in conversation about what makes a good house and how that can be institutionalized, from the banks of the Charles to the Radcliffe Quad.

Ninety-nine percent of Harvard College students — including incoming students, returning students, and late admits — have now completed this year’s edition of the school’s annual Title IX training module, according to College Title IX Coordinator Brian Libby.
The 2019-2020 academic year marks the second time that course enrollment has been tied to completion of the training module, which teaches participants about Harvard’s Title IX policies and procedures. Last year, 100 percent of degree-seeking College students completed the training.
Prior to last year, the training was said to be mandatory, but had no enforcement mechanism and its completion rate was much lower. The 2017-2018 school year reported a 71 percent completion rate, and the 2016-2017 rate was 67 percent.
The training seeks to promote cultural changes around sexual misconduct, according to Harvard's Title IX website. The program aims to educate students, faculty, and staff on what “sexual harassment” might look like, as well as what the school’s enforcement of Title IX — a federal anti-sex-discrimination law that underpins Harvard’s sexual and gender-based harassment policies — entails.
In addition to making training mandatory, the Title IX office has recently expanded both its educational content and its target audience. Last spring, in the wake of sexual harassment allegations against Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez, the University began requiring all Harvard faculty and staff to complete a specially designed Title IX training module. Trainings have also been made available at Harvard’s graduate schools.
The 2019 iteration of the training included student anecdotes, examples of situations that could constitute Title IX violations, and resources available to students. For the first time in recent years, it did not include former College Title IX coordinator Emily Miller, who left the role recently and will be replaced in October by newly hired coordinator Erin Clark.
As in 2018, the small group of students who have failed to complete the module will have a hold on their course registration until they do so.
This year’s training came several months after the University participated in its second national sexual misconduct climate survey, which analyzed students’ experiences of harassment at Harvard. The survey’s results, which will be released this fall, will offer another measure of how the University’s culture has changed in the years since Harvard made its trainings mandatory.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
British Speaker of the House of Commons John S. Bercow delivered a public address on the state of British Parliament to a packed room at the Institute of Politics Monday.
The event was co-sponsored by the Project of the Transatlantic Relationship, an initiative that first launched at the Harvard Kennedy School in April 2018. Cathryn C. Ashbrook, the project’s executive director, moderated the discussion following Bercow’s speech.
In addition to inquiries about Brexit and his role in modernizing parliament, Bercow also fielded a question from visiting Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Todd Gillespie about allegations of widespread bullying in the Brtish Parliament that were included in an October report. Bercow himself may face an investigation over historical complaints of bullying after an inquiry into the allegations found a culture of “deference, subservience, acquiescence and silence” in the British Parliament.
Bercow categorically denied all allegations of abusive conduct at the forum Monday.
“I totally and utterly refute any allegation against me of bullying. I have never bullied anyone, anywhere, in any way, at any time,” Bercow said. “What I have done is stand up for the rights of the House of Commons, champion the legislature, ensure that intimidation of those who want to speak their mind does not hold sway.”
During his tenure, Bercow — who has announced he will step down at the next election or in October — has asserted the need to protect the authority of the House of Commons while mitigating the growing influence of the government.
“People felt that Parliament had to change,” he said. “The power of government had increased and was continuing to increase, and in my judgement it had to be reduced or checked.”
Bercow outlined his efforts to promote Standing Order 24 — the mechanism by which members of Parliament can pose “urgent questions” in order to trigger an emergency debate. Through the order, Bercow said he aimed to encourage members of Parliament to “come back to the chamber.”
“Too often there’s a mismatch between what we’re debating and what the public are thinking,” Bercow said. “What we need to do is to revive urgency and topicality.”
Bercow, who spoke of a “democratic renaissance,” touched on many of the other initiatives he has taken to revitalize and diversify the British Parliamentary system. Beyond appointing the first female Speaker’s chaplain, Bercow has also spearheaded efforts to construct a nursery at the Parliamentary Estate and build a civics education center at Westminster.
After the address concluded, the IOP posted a video of the talk to its website. Gillespie wrote in an email Monday night that the online recording cut out for a portion of his question, during which he had detailed some of the harassment allegations against Bercow.
When asked about the missing portion of the recording, IOP Commuications Director Kelsey A. Donohue wrote in an email Monday night that it was “completely unintentional.”
“No one from our team knows the source of the glitch,” she wrote. “We’ve reached out to HKS Media Services to repair the footage but they likely won’t be able to adjust until the a.m.”
Ryan Zhang ’21, who attended the talk, commended Bercow’s efforts to reform the British legislature.
“He’s pursuing some important — and I think new — structural changes to Parliament,” Zhang said. “Making Parliament more democratic, making it more representative, making it more active in British political life.”
Attendee John R. Our ’22 said he appreciated Bercow’s reformational message.
“I think he showed how democracy should work and how we can aim to fix it,” Our said. “And that his role is not to take a side but to protect the institutions that we value.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amidst ongoing citywide debate over how to best combat the affordable housing crisis, participants in Monday’s Cambridge City Council meeting disagreed over a controversial petition that would amend existing zoning plans on New Street to add affordable housing units.
The proposed amendment would have facilitated the construction of a mixed-use development, with affordable housing in the front of the proposed building and a commercial storage facility in the rear.
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux spoke against the petition, arguing that, under current negotiations with Boston-based development firm SSG Development, the proposed design plans would not be the best use of space.
“We could get a housing developer to buy this site and develop it as housing and produce as many affordable units. And we wouldn’t have to be negotiating uncertain terms and basically funding them,” Devereaux said.
Craig Nicholson, a member of non-profit housing agency Just-A-Start, defended the petition against criticism that the development would not benefit the community.
“I've been up here multiple times talking about a staunch commitment to working with SSG to ensure that the affordable housing that is designed and built is up to Just-A-Start standards,” Nicholson said.
The council ultimately voted down the petition in a 7-2 vote. Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Vice Mayor Devereux, and Councilors Dennis Carlone, Craig Kelley, Alanna M. Mallon, Sumbul Siddiqui, and Quinton Zondervan voted against, while Councilors Timothy J. Toomey Jr. and E. Denise Simmons voted in favor.
In addition to the debate over the mixed-use development, several city residents stated their disappointment that the annual Cambridge Carnival had been cancelled this year due to safety concerns following gun violence near Boston’s Caribbean Carnival.
“If we can allow Boston Marathon to go forward after the events that took place there, we need to find some solution this year to having another means to do at least some kind of carnival event,” said Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor and member of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association Steering Committee.
Several other city residents also spoke in support of the current version of the Cannabis Business Permitting Ordinance, which dictates the sale of recreational marijuana in Cambridge. If enacted, the proposed law would establish a two-year moratorium, during which only cannabis businesses that make certifiable contributions towards social equity or economic empowerment would be granted permits in the city.
Joseph Gilmore, a member of the Massachusetts Recreational Consumer Council, argued that the two-year exclusivity period would be necessary for local businesses to fairly compete in the market.
“Would you like to be remembered as a council that supported local business owners who have experienced hardships of the war on drugs, or these large corporations that are owned by the same owners as Bank of America and Goldman Sachs?” he asked the council.
The Ordinance Committee plans to ensue discussion on the recreational marijuana law on Wednesday morning at 11 am.

Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang spoke to a crowd of hundreds at a rally in Cambridge Common Monday evening, during which he discussed his proposal for universal basic income.
The rally came just four days after Yang’s appearance in the third Democratic presidential debate, during which he announced a raffle to give away $120,000 to 10 families over the course of a year to promote his universal basic income proposal. Yang’s proposal — officially named the “Freedom Dividend” — would give every American adult $1000 per month.
During his 30-minute speech at Monday’s rally, Yang defended the proposal by noting that many Americans have advocated for similar universal basic income policies over the course of the nation’s history.
“You dig into the freedom dividend, and you find that it’s a deeply American idea,” Yang said. “Thomas Paine, one of our founding fathers, was for it at the beginning. And Martin Luther King championed it in 1967.”
Yang also discussed a rise in automation as a catalyst for many of the nation’s recent changes, including a decline in life expectancies and the election of President Donald Trump. He said these changes have taken root in the Midwest.
“We have automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa,” Yang said. “If those states sound familiar to you, those are all the swing states that Donald Trump had to win and did win.”
He argued that more jobs will likely be threatened or eliminated by automation and artificial intelligence within the next few years as automation grows in other sectors of the economy.
Yang’s supporters at Monday’s rally traveled from near and far to Cambridge Common sporting “MATH” — “Make America Think Harder” — hats and “Yang Gang” signs. New York resident Tim R. Renteria said he traveled to Cambridge to show his enthusiasm for Yang’s candidacy and his universal basic income proposal.
“The freedom dividend, I totally support that. It makes a lot of sense for me and my family,” Renteria said. “And then after that, I would say his climate change proposal, his foreign policies as well — all of them are really thought out and have a lot of solid basis.”
Matthew P. Martin, another attendee of the rally, praised Yang for his ideas to help Americans whose jobs have been affected by the growth of automation.
“Both of my parents were in the manufacturing industry, and they both lost their jobs,” Martin said. “So this was the first politician I ever heard that actually talked about, like the working middle class in a way that he did.”
Monday's rally comes as 19 other Democratic candidates travel the country to gain support ahead of the Iowa caucuses in early Feburary. Yang is currently polling at 3 percent, according to a RealClearPolitics poll. The field also includes Harvard affiliates Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, and Julian Castro, who are polling at 17 percent, 5 percent, and 1.2 percent, respectively.
Attendee Harry Biedermann said he plans to vote for Yang in the Democratic primary election and that Yang’s universal basic income proposal would “do a lot” for the U.S. economy.
Biedermann added that he believes the raffle Yang announced at the debate last week proves that Yang is “not just talking to talk” but will also “walk the walk.”
“He believes in this idea, and he's willing to privately fund it,” Biedermann said. “I really haven't seen a lot of other presidents candidates sort of step up in this unique giveaway, and really trying to make a change for the people who need it the most.”

After moving into a renovated neo-Georgian dormitory complex at 10 Holyoke Place, Lowell House welcomed 49 new members — including former University President Drew G. Faust and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay — to its Senior Common Room this fall.
Lowell’s new faculty deans, Nina Zipser and David I. Laibson ’88, expanded their house’s SCR by 25 percent — from about 190 members last year to 239 this semester. In addition to Faust and Gay, the list of leading Harvard administrators who joined the Lowell SCR this year include Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda Claybaugh, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Francis J. Doyle III, and former FAS Dean Michael D. Smith.
At least 21 current and former deans and associate deans make up Lowell’s SCR, along with multiple department chairs, University Professors, and other top administrators.
The term “Senior Common Room” refers to both a physical space in each of the College’s houses and a group of people to whom undergraduates can turn for mentorship, career advice, and personal support. These include administrators and graduate students who live in each House, as well as non-residential affiliates like faculty members, alumni, and local professionals.
Laibson said he and Zipser considered “many factors” when inviting professors and administrators to join the SCR — a variety of academic interests and life experiences, a desire to connect with Lowell undergraduates, and the deans’ personal “familiarity in some form.”
“I would say that one of the critical things on our minds is creating a diverse community, with many different perspectives, different fields, different life experiences,” Laibson said.
“Of course, we’re influenced by who we’ve happened to have gotten to know over the years. So in part I think the list reflects the people who we’ve interacted with, it could be a committee that we’ve both served on, it could be a colleague whose book we recently read, someone who we’ve just come to know in some context,” Laibson added.
The duo have both held leadership positions in FAS. Zipser is the current dean for Faculty Affairs and Planning, and Laibson is the former Economics department chair.
The SCR system — which is derived from historic residential colleges at Cambridge and Oxford in England — varies widely across the 12 houses in terms of the quality and volume of its programming; faculty deans are responsible for implementing an SCR as they see fit. A 2009 FAS report on the House Renewal project described the SCR as “an outdated concept that in many cases is not working well for current students and faculty.”
Several House leaders and SCR members interviewed in 2017 said that some houses’ SCRs are characterized by affiliates’ limited involvement, inconvenient event scheduling, and poor participation from students.
The expansion of the Lowell SCR’s member list comes with an expansion of student-facing SCR programming in the house. Prior to this year, Lowell’s former faculty deans — Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin — invited SCR affiliates to participate in house-wide events like weekly Thursday teas and formal “High Table” dinners with the senior class. They also opened the dining hall to all SCR affiliates.
This year, Laibson and Zipser instituted two new programs. The first is Lowell Conversations, weekly events during which an SCR member leads a discussion with students. The second is a program for undergraduates to invite SCR affiliates to three meals each semester.
Lowell resident Tatiana S. Jimenez ’21 said she is excited to reach out to a member of the SCR who shares her academic interests.
“Last year, I remember there [was] specifically somebody who does like urban planning, and I’m very interested in that. So I was going to go through the list and try to find him so I could reach out to them,” Jimenez said. “There's so many cool people. And I feel like it's going to be really nice to get to know them. And ask them literally, like, any question about the future.”
The Lowell Conversations series kicked off last Thursday, with English professor Louis Menand leading a discussion on affirmative action and social justice.
Laibson said though he and Zipser made the final decisions on SCR affiliate selection, they placed weight on advice from Lowell residents.
“I would say that anyone who came to us with a suggestion definitely had our ear,” Laibson said. “If someone came to us with a good suggestion, we acted upon it. And there were many such suggestions, so that’s not a hypothetical. We got lots of great recommendations from existing members of the community.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off of an opening weekend which may have seen it play its two strongest opponents of the season, Harvard (0-4-0) rounded out its opening string of away games over this past weekend. The Crimson fell to Vermont (3-3-0) by a score of 4-2 on Friday before dropping a 1-0 decision to Providence (4-2-0) on Monday night.
HARVARD 0, PROVIDENCE 1
Harvard traveled down to Providence on Monday for a rematch of its 2018 home opener, which ended 2-1 in the Crimson’s favor. Things were tougher for Harvard this season, as a 21’ goal from Providence’s Tiago Mendonca ended up being the difference in the back and forth affair.
“We gave a strong effort and had our chances but unfortunately lost a close contest,” said junior midfielder Sebastian Lindner-Liaw. “We’ll regroup and start preparing for our home opener next Tuesday.”
The result, while far from ideal from the Crimson’s point of view, shows that progress is being made by the team this season. The team showed signs of promise, registering three shots on goal, and at least a couple of chances to come away with a tie.
Harvard has been experimenting with its lineup throughout the start of the season, and Monday night’s game was no exception. First year goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson played his first minutes of his career for the Crimson, registering six saves in a full ninety minutes.
Nilsson is a member of the small army of six goalkeepers currently on the Harvard roster. Following the departure of would-be junior goalkeeper Matt Freese over the summer, who now plays for the Philadelphia Union in Major League Soccer, the Crimson has been looking to replace his spot in the net.
While fellow first year Bobby Harraka has the most minutes of the six goalkeepers so far, tonight’s team selection makes it seem that the goalkeeping position is still open for the taking.
First year forward Duncan Sutherland also made his career debut on the night, playing about 40 minutes up top and registering a single shot for Harvard.
HARVARD 2, VERMONT, 4
Harvard scored its first goals of the season on Friday night, but was not able to pull out its first result, as it fell 4-2 in Vermont.
The game was one of multiple momentum shifts, with neither team putting the other out of reach until the very end. Vermont took a 2-0 lead in the first half, scoring through a well-executed set piece and a looping cross, but the Crimson was not deterred. While Vermont maintained some control through the rest of the half, the game was far from over.
Just seconds into the second half, Harvard got on the board for the first time this season through sophomore forward Alfred Perez. Perez grabbed his fourth career goal for the Crimson, with it coming off of a cross from junior midfielder Fernando Docters less than a minute into the second half.
As the saying goes, goals change games, and this goal did just that. With the Crimson continuing to commit players forward, Vermont began to sit back, allowing pressure from Harvard. This paid off, when in the 61st minute, it scored on a breakaway to go ahead 3-1.
Harvard again slimmed the margin to a single goal in the 71st minute through first year forward Martin Vician. The Bratislava, Slovakia native got on the end of a free kick from fellow first year midfielder Willem Ebbinge. With 20 minutes to go, the Crimson was again within touching distance.
Dreams of a first win coming through a dramatic comeback were shattered when Vermont tallied a fourth goal just a couple minutes later to pull ahead 4-2. Although Harvard did not give up after this goal, it did not have enough remaining in the tank to pull out a result.
Bobby Harraka racked up nine saves on the night for the Crimson, which put his season tally at an Ivy League-leading 24. While he did not get the nod for Monday’s game in Providence, he continued to make a case for himself between the sticks with his performance on Friday.
Although the road trip was not kind to Harvard, the team will have ample time to rest and prepare for its next outing. The Crimson will finally get to play in front of its home fans next week, as it hosts Merrimack in its home opener on Tuesday at 7 p.m. on Jordan Field.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The past week has been an adventure for No. 10 Harvard field hockey fans. A near-win against a top-25 opponent in Stanford, and a tight game against in-state rival UMass have held the Crimson steady at .500. The rollercoaster of hot and cool play has given Harvard field hockey plenty to be proud of and plenty to think about as the Crimson heads to its final game before Ivy League play begins.
HARVARD 3, UMASS 2
Harvard (2-2) needed a win after suffering consecutive losses to No. 4 UConn and No. 18 Stanford last week, and it earned one Monday night on the road against UMass to return to .500. The game was tied at the half, in spite of a strong Crimson start, after UMass (2-4) managed to score twice in the second half.
“We had two different Harvard teams,” said Crimson coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “One where we were really bringing a lot of energy and putting it to work … [but being] at ease snuck up on us.”
After the intermission, Harvard took to the field with its initial energy, putting up two shots before earning its decisive penalty corner ten minutes in. Freshman defender Mazarine Broze flicked the ball into play. A scramble in front of the net ensued, and sophomore forward Rachel Greenwood fired. The ball rebounded to its point of origin, Greenwood collected, set, and shot again — this time for the game winner.
“We have a very talented group with really good options on that penalty corner,” van Herwaarden said. “I think our penalty corner can definitely be a strength for us.”
Harvard had entered with the same energy it used to close out regulation against Stanford, scoring on the first shot of the game. An assist from senior forward Casey Allen four minutes in, and sophomore forward Olivia Hoover buried the ball in the back of the net.
Ten minutes later, co-captain Mimi Tarrant stole the ball in the middle of the field and drove to the goal for a perfect shot. The Crimson leapt out to a 2-0 lead.
“We were really dominating, in control that first quarter,” said van Herwaarden. “I think we just were thinking, this is going to be an easy game for us, and we got hit hard when we thought that, allowing UMass to come back on two easy goals.”
UMass took to the field in the second quarter showing the same vigor with which Harvard had entered. Drawing inspiration from their namesakes, the Minutewomen beat back the Crimson coats to knot the game at two to close out the half.
With its tied score, the second half brought a clean slate for both teams. Harvard drew strength from that tabula rasa, taking to the field with a determination to bring this win home. Such a quest was not without its challenges.
“UMass didn’t make it easy for us,” Tarrant said. “They were very physical on and off the ball, and they had a lot of quick breakaways ... There were also a lot of other situations we had, such as them pulling net so they had an extra outfield player, us getting a green card in the last couple of minutes while they had an extra outfield player.”
Ultimately, the Crimson scored in the third quarter and held on for the win.
“We knew we’d played well against Stanford, and it was making sure we could get the win off the back of our good play,” Tarrant said. “Overall, very happy with the fact that we won against UMass today. I think that was really important for the team’s spirit.”
HARVARD 1, STANFORD 2 (SO)
After 58 minutes of play last Thursday, Harvard was minutes away from dropping back-to-back games for the first time since a September 2017 loss to then No. 2 — and eventual national champion — UConn.
The Crimson, though, had been on fire the entire last quarter, emerging from the break with a palpable desire to triumph over No. 18 Stanford (5-3).
A shotless third period from Harvard belied the effort seen thus far in the game. Despite being in the hole, the Crimson outshot Stanford by a 9-3 margin through the first half, the only goal a Stanford score on a penalty corner.
Then, with less than two minutes to go, Harvard was awarded a penalty corner of its own. The Crimson executed a playbook-perfect setup: the shot from Casey Allen, the placement at the top of the arc by sophomore midfielder Kiley Allen, and the shot from co-captain Bente van Vlijmen to send it home. But the unbreachable Stanford goalkeeper, senior Kelsey Bing, managed a deflection. Casey Allen cooly collected the rebound and fired, tying the match.
Although not literally last-minute, Harvard had waited 58 minutes and 12 shots for its goal. Ninety seconds later brought another Crimson penalty corner. This shot, though, was not destined for the greatness of its predecessor. The game headed to overtime.
Six minutes into the first of potentially two sudden-death overtimes, a penalty on Harvard in the penalty circle brought a one-on-one. The crowd rose to its feet in support of stellar sophomore goalie Ellie Shahbo, a first-team First Team All-Ivy selection, who managed to deflect the shot and keep the Crimson’s hopes alive.
One minute into the final block of overtime, an arching shot by Rachel Greenwood would have ended the game, but for the reaching stick of Bing. The chance was Harvard’s last of the night, and the game headed to penalty strokes, where Stanford emerged the victor.
The Crimson returns home for a 1 p.m. game against Maine (1-4) on Sunday before heading to New Haven on September 28 to open Ivy League play at 12 p.m. against Yale (1-3).

Ahh, yes. Now that fall semester’s kicking into full gear, assignments are getting harder, lectures are getting longer, and productivity levels are decreasing rapidly. Curious about what exactly you’ve gotten yourself into? Why not take a quick look at some of the Fall 2018 Q Guide comments students had on the classes you’re taking this semester? (Caution: Yes, these are real comments, but maybe do some of your own investigative work before making any judgements. Except for Ec10a, of course.)
Music 97L: Critical Listening
Faculty Reply to Q Guide comments: “To characterize this course as "extremely narrow" is beyond incorrect; it is itself an "egregious" and "disingenuous" mischaracterization of the course, bent solely on torpedoing my reputation. In other words, it is trolling. Reader, I hope you will take the person's counterfactual diatribes with a grain of salt.”
This is the first faculty reply to Q Guide comments we’ve come across, and to say that we are intrigued would be an understatement.
Math 18A: Multivariable Calculus for Social Sciences
“An unequivocally torturous venture that manages to wring out every last ounce of intellectual curiosity one might still possess. Only take if regular dips into the well of misery are all that you live for. A truly harrowing experience.”
We’re sure Math 18a isn’t all that horrible, but we sympathize with this tortured soul and appreciate the vivid description.
LIFESCI 1A: An Integrated Introduction to the Life Sciences: Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Cell Biology 
“Thought you were good at chemistry? Thought you liked biology? Were you thinking of concentrating in the hard sciences? This course will change all of that. The first few lectures are fine, but after a couple weeks this course will make you doubt your admission to Harvard. It will crush your self-confidence and make you feel like the dumbest person in the entire world...”
LS1a is truly a unique experience that prepares you for many other life science classes here at Harvard, but we understand the struggle this student felt. Remember though, office hours are key and there are resources to help you through academics and other challenges!
ECON10A: Principles of Economics 
“I never feel worse about myself or a test than I do when I walk out of the science center after an ec exam.”
Oh, you thought we would stop at one comment?
“Not that hard. Do not fall for the hype. P sets suck up a lot of time but it’s sorta nice to do them with everyone night before its [sic] due. Tests are easy. Unit review is clutch.”
Okay, is this the same Ec10a we took?
“Taking this course was the worst mistake of my entire life, and I have had 18 years of questionable decision making.”
Hm, that’s more like it. And, finally, just for kicks...
“I can unironically say that I would have preferred to have been beaten to a bloody pulp than take this class. The beating is a once-off incident, whereas the trauma from this course will haunt me until the day I die.”
With this true range of responses, it seems that Ec10a has lived up to its hype. Who knows what this year’s new version of the class will bring.
However you feel about the classes you’re taking this fall, just remember: Your responses to the Q Guide will live in infamy. And hey, if the promise of getting to rant/gush at the end of the year is the only thing keeping you going, at least you know that someone will read it.
