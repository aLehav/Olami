After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this month, the department of visual and environmental studies organized its semesterly student film screenings to showcase a series of short fictional, documentary, and animated films that are produced in Harvard’s film making/video making classes. The Crimson talked to several participants about their works and their experiences.

Benjamin D. Sorscher ’18 - Miss Sandy (VES 151BR: Nonfiction Video Projects)
With no dialogue, the short documentary follows fishermen Al and Joe as they bring in the daily haul.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you decide to make this film, and has your focus changed over time?
Benjamin D. Sorscher: This film is actually a smaller part of a larger film I’m working on. I was just reading news about some fishermen in New England. They’ve been faced with a difficult situation recently—some combination of overfishing and climate change—and fish population have gone way down. So the government steps in and puts quotas on the number of fish they are allowed to catch. It seems like a tough situation, because on one hand fishing is deeply rooted in the tradition of New England and many fishermen are losing their jobs. On the other hand you have to do something to protect the environment. So I was interested in that.
I got in touch with some fishermen. It took a long time to get them to be comfortable with me coming to film. I actually spent a day scooping red fish soup for them, and I think that helped them to know me better. So they let me come on their boat with them, and that was just such a completely alienating experience. We got up at 2 A.M. It was pitch black. We drove for three hours out to the middle of water. They dropped their nets in it, dragged them for an hour, and then pulled in this absurd amount of fish. I’d never seen any of this before, and I was with my camera, so I just tried to capture as much as I could. So [the focus of this project] kind of has changed. I was more interested in the plight they were facing, but at some point I just became very interested in their work and wanted to capture what exactly this experience is like.
THC: How did you recreate this particular experience on screen?
BDS: One of the strongest feelings I felt was the sense of total isolation. You really feel there’s nothing around. The fog was surrounding us. You couldn’t see more than 50 feet, but you knew that even if you could, there wouldn’t be anything to see. I really tried to just lock the camera down and have these composed frames, long shots. It kind of felt like the fish and the sea were infinite. I wanted to compose the frame so that the fish spill off the frame, [to show] this infinite pile of fish, this infinite mass of water.
THC: After filming, how did you structure the movie during the editing process?
BDS: I just wanted to cut it together so that it conveys what exactly this experience is like. When I was talking to this woman Angela [who is a fisherman’s wife], she got kind of emotional and she was like, “Ben, you know, this is all we’ve ever done. We’ve been doing this for centuries and we are not going to be able to do it anymore. We’re the last fishermen in New England, so we need you to come and capture what this experience is like.” When I heard that, I was like, now I know what to do.

Joule P. Voelz ’17 - Deliver as Addressed (VES 150A: Narrative Tactilities: Intermediate Film Production)
In a post office where employees work all day to cut letters into pieces, a girl finds a letter full of hatred and is unsure what to do with it.
THC: Did the project start with a concept, a character, or a story?
Joule P. Voelz: I usually start thinking about films from images, so I was just really intrigued by a movie about someone who’s working in some sort of bureaucracy that’s never explained, but then having their own agenda. From there I just imagined what kind of characters I might find there, what they might do.
THC: Why did you choose a post office to be this bureaucracy?
JPV: Thinking back to when I was a kid, the post office was always a symbol of bureaucracy that moves really slowly and seems nonsensical. I was drawn to the idea of cutting off letters without any explanation of why this is happening, yet we accept it.
THC: Is there a message that the film tries to convey?
JPV: I was most interested in the idea of lack of communication, and at the same time also the idea of sending a message by an interesting medium, or having someone else send the message for you, which is kind of how the film ends. I’m interested in the different ways people communicate, and how things are translated and interpreted.
THC: It’s fascinating that the message that gets through in the film is one of hatred.
JPV: I think I’m interested in it because that’s not what you expect to see, and that’s the kind of message that often gets gobbled. I think it’s really funny if the only message that gets communicated is abject hatred.
THC: When you had the script ready, how did you envision the visuals of the film?
JPV: I wanted it to seem really clinical, and sort of lifeless in a bureaucratic way, so I was drawn to greens and yellows and not too much lighting. I was somewhat drawn to the images in “The Lives of Others.”
THC: Here on campus you are very involved in theater. Do you think your film is influenced by it?
JPV: I think so. I mostly do Harvard College Opera. When I direct a show and when I direct a movie, visual elements call out to me most. One day I really hope to have dialogues in my movies, but I’ve always been thinking about how to communicate information based on how things are placed, and how things are lit, and what’s the relationship.

Maryssa R. Barron ’17 - Entertaining with Fire (VES 158BR: Sensory Ethnography 2)
The film focuses on two hunting guides and a hunting client as they go hunting together.
THC: What drew you to your subject?
MRB: This is part of my senior thesis. I study social anthropology, and I’m writing about game hunting and how in South Africa in particular, it’s at the intersection between conservation, ecotourism, environmental governance, and issues like land ownership. Last year I met [the director of Harvard’s sensory ethnography lab] Lucien Castaing-Taylor. He was interested in my subject and helped me get a camera. It was my first time ever shooting film.
THC: Can you tell us more about what’s at stake about game hunting in South Africa?
MRB: Long story short, eighty percent of wildlife conservation in South Africa relies on privately held land. For most farmers, there needs to be economic values to the animals in order to encourage people to keep them on their land. Part of the animals’ value is classic photographic safari, but the other aspect is that there’s a large game hunting industry. It has been proven in several different studies that there does need to be this section of recreational hunting… and if these game hunts aren’t economically viable, we’ll end up not having as much land for conservation.
THC: Did you encounter any difficulty in getting consent from your subjects?
MRB: No. I am from the South… from an area where there are a lot of deer hunters. I came to this topic in part because of the lion event, where a lion was killed a couple summers ago, and people freaked out on Facebook. There was an overwhelming vilification of these hunters that didn’t understand. I knew that hunters believe in conservation and are not amoral characters. So I really sought to find out why people are so quick to condemn it and why it still continues. I didn’t really have difficulties [getting consent] because I positioned myself as someone who wants to problematize the overwhelming public opinion that what they are doing is bad, because it’s just not backed by conservation science at all.
THC: What’s your understanding of the concept of sensory ethnography?
MRB: Sensory ethnography has many interpretations depending on who is approaching the subject. A filmmaker will definitely approach the subject differently from an anthropologist, and what’s interesting about the class is that they do strive to make it half film students, half  anthropology students. It is a way to present an idea with an experience that I don’t think I can do discursively. For me it means not only a way to represent my own experiences, but also a way to make it accessible to an audience beyond those that will read my thesis. I really focus on the ethnography aspect of the film, meaning emphasis is placed on spending a lot of time with subjects in order to better empathize with their practices, or at least understand them better than if you were just there filming for one day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Columbia University has objected to the “conduct” of a vote permitting eligible students at the school to form a union and called for a new union election, arguing to the National Labor Relations Board that alleged voting day violations could have skewed results of the election.
At Columbia, eligible graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants voted in favor of unionization by a vote of 1,602 to 623 on Dec. 7 and 8 and became the first group of students at a private university to successfully unionize after a landmark NLRB ruling in August. In its “statement of objections” to the NLRB, Columbia has asked the NLRB to “set aside” those results and conduct a new election.
Columbia’s filing comes as graduate and undergraduate teaching and researching assistants at Harvard await the results of their own unionization election, which took place Nov. 16 and 17. The results of that vote have been repeatedly delayed as parties sort through challenged ballots, but the NLRB could announce whether or not eligible Harvard students can form a union as early as Thursday.
Columbia listed several alleged election day violations in its filing to the NLRB, including allegations that “Union agents” were within 100 feet of a particular polling place and that a university official observing the election was dismissed in front of eligible voters. These alleged violations, Columbia wrote in the statement, “destroyed the laboratory conditions necessary for an election.”
Other statements in the filing allege that an NLRB “Board Agent” closed the doors to one polling location, which the filing argues could have prevented students from voting. The filing also charges that the same agent “turned away many prospective voters after running out of challenge ballot envelopes” and that ineligible students may have voted because of discrepancies in voter ID policy.
While the unionization vote passed at Columbia by a wide margin, Columbia officials wrote in the filing that when the “no” votes and challenged ballots are counted together, the union’s margin of victory is 332 ballots, a small percentage of the larger eligible voting pool.
The 647 challenged ballots—ballots set aside and not yet counted due to issues of eligibility—cannot numerically sway the election even if each one was against unionization. Still, the filing argues that the vote margin, when counted to include challenged ballots, is small enough that students who did not vote because they “may well have been deterred from voting by the objectionable conduct” could have swayed the election.
To Columbia Ph.D. student and union organizer Olga Brudastova, the union’s victory in the election was  “overwhelming.” She called the administration's move a “classic delay tactic.”
“We did hope that it wouldn’t reach that point, especially since we moved throughout the whole week without any objections from them,” Brudastova said. Some union organizers at Columbia wrote in a Facebook post that they are worried that Donald Trump’s presidential administration could affect the unionization process if it is delayed enough.
Robert Hornsby, Columbia’s Media Relations Assistant Vice President, declined to comment on whether Columbia’s objections are part of any delay tactic or strategy, but wrote in an email that the objections were filed “as part of [the NLRB’s] established procedure for determining whether the conduct of the election was appropriate.”
“We share the NLRB’s goal of ensuring a fair electoral process and protecting the rights of all students,” Hornsby wrote.
Harvard unionization organizers have circulated a petition calling on Columbia to drop its objections.
“Our hope is that the Columbia administration will respect the democratic decision of Columbia student workers and use its vast resources to bargain with GWC-UAW instead of fight them,” Harvard union organizer and Ph.D. student Jack M. Nicoludis wrote in an email.
The NLRB allows a seven day window after ballots are counted for parties to file objections. Columbia filed its objections Dec. 16, seven days after the tally. Under NLRB rules, post-election hearings for objections open 21 days after the tally or as soon as possible after, but the parties may agree to an earlier date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pusey Minister in the Memorial Church Jonathan L. Walton took the symbolic step Monday of designating the Church a “sanctuary” space for Harvard affiliates two weeks after University President Drew G. Faust said she would not adopt the label for Harvard's campus.
In a sermon to congregants Sunday, Walton reflected on the country’s current political climate, characterizing it as an atmosphere that has alienated individuals “born in certain countries” or “of a certain religion or race.”
“If you belong to Harvard, you belong to us. More importantly, we belong to you,” Walton said. “So if sanctuary is what you seek, this is the perfect season to tell you that the Memorial Church is a place for you to lay your head.”


After Donald Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election, students and faculty at Harvard have called on administrators to designate the University a "sanctuary campus"—a symbolic term indicating that the school will protect undocumented students. During the campaign, Trump proposed a number of anti-immigrant policies, including repealing protections for undocumented people living in the United States.
At a Faculty meeting in December, Faust said Harvard would not designate itself a “sanctuary campus,” arguing that the term was nebulous and does not provide concrete protections. She also said that using the label could draw further federal scrutiny to undocumented students on Harvard's campus.
"Sanctuary campus status has no legal significance or even clear definition. It offers no actual protection to our students,” Faust said at the meeting. “I worry that in fact it offers false and misleading assurance.”
At the meeting and in a subsequent interview, Faust pointed to several initiatives Harvard has undertaken to support undocumented students, including appointing a coordinator for advising efforts for undocumented students and inviting immigration experts to the College. Additionally, she reiterated a message from the Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. Riley, who said HUPD will not inquire about the immigration status of Harvard affiliates or actively enforce federal immigration laws on campus.
Faust said she is "ramping up" advocacy efforts in Washington D.C. under the Trump administration.
Some undocumented students and activists said they were disappointed with Faust’s decision not to adopt the label.
In his sermon, Walton said he appreciated the efforts Harvard has made to express support for its undocumented students.
“President Drew Faust has tried to make it clear, ‘wherever you came from, you are here. And if you are at Harvard, you are home,’” he said.
Harvard is not the only Ivy-League institution that has grappled with the label. Both Princeton and Brown have declined to adopt the label. Amy Gutmann '71, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in an email to students in November that the university was a "sanctuary" but did not explicitly label the university a "sanctuary campus."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In another contest one could label as a trap game, the Harvard women’s basketball team overcame Siena (2-8, 1-1 MAAC) on the road for a 65-58 victory. The win extended the team’s unbeaten streak to nine, the longest non-conference run in program history.
With final exams finishing up the day before, the Crimson (9-1) faced a grueling bus trip to upstate New York before heading to their respective hometowns for the Christmas holiday. Despite having two weeks without competitive basketball since the win at Kansas, the visitors picked up where they left off, only trailing for 61 seconds in the entire game.
“No matter who we’re playing, we have to come to play, we have to have high intensity,” said freshman point guard Katie Benzan. “If we play Harvard basketball, we know we’ll grind it out and get the win.”
Following its general modus operandi for the season, Harvard controlled the game throughout but never truly buried the Saints. A late rally cut the lead to three with just 17 seconds remaining, but Benzan hit both ensuing free throws before sophomore guard Jackie Benitez, the hosts’ leading scorer, missed a three at the other end, solidifying the result.
The Crimson once again benefitted from its backcourt depth—three guards were in double-figures offensively. With freshman forward Jeannie Boehm once again commanding multiple defenders on any given possession, Benzan and sophomore guards Sydney Skinner, Nani Redford, and Madeline Raster took advantage. The backcourt quartet combined to shoot 15-for-29, including an 8-of-14 mark from beyond the arc, with 46 points and 12 of Harvard’s 15 assists.
“Our point guards have added some great leadership on the floor,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Even when the basketball gets ugly, they’re providing some real, confident leadership. We almost always have four or five people in double figures…. We have a lot of ways to score, and I don’t think we have any selfish players on our team.”
Boehm was not a factor in the points category, contributing just one made free throw, but she was active on defense with nine rebounds, a block, and a steal. She had four offensive boards, one of which led to a Benzan three and the other to opportunities at the free throw line. Boehm came into the game 11th in the country with three blocks per game, showing her ability to make an impact on both ends of the court.
“We don’t need [Jeannie] to score 20 points a ball game,” Delaney-Smith said. “She probably has the ability to do that, but other teams are zoning in on her. She was a really strong rebounder today, she’s playing terrific defense for a freshman. For a freshman to keep the other parts of her game together, she’s doing a nice job.”
Despite limiting Siena’s offensive opportunities, the Crimson struggled to find an offensive rhythm of its own. Turnovers were the prime culprit, with the visitors recording 26 turnovers, one shy of its season-high against NJIT a few weeks ago. Harvard is now averaging 17.9 turnovers per game, tied for 244th in the country (out of 344 teams).
“It’s not the same kind of turnovers in any game,” Delaney-Smith said. “If a team’s design (i.e. Kansas) is to jump in the passing lanes, that’s one thing. Today was a function of the end of exams, being packed for Christmas. That’s what those turnovers looked like today; things were ugly on the offensive end.”
Harvard also made up for its offensive deficiencies by continuing its dominance of the glass. The visitors outrebounded the Saints, 46-28, including a 13-6 margin on the offensive end. The Crimson averages 44.8 rebounds per game, tied for 18th in the nation.
