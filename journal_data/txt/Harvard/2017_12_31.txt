After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When President Donald Trump took office in January, a sense of crisis gripped students and administrators on campus. Trump’s unexpected victory prompted many, including University President Drew G. Faust, to increase advocacy efforts around political issues affecting Harvard affiliates.
Hours after Trump issued an executive order closing America’s borders to seven predominantly Muslim countries in January, more than 150 Harvard affiliates staged an “emergency protest.” University administrators, including Faust, criticized the ban and Harvard soon filed amicus briefs against it. When Trump signed the second iteration of his travel ban in March, Harvard affiliates again took to the streets in protest and the Harvard International Office counseled those affected.
Trump's immigration orders temporarily barred four Iranian scientists slated to study at Harvard from entering the country; all four, however, eventually made it to the United States. 
On multiple occasions, Faust traveled to Washington to meet with lawmakers from both parties, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, and Vice President Mike Pence. Faust voiced concerns about protections for undocumented students, the tax-exempt status of the University’s endowment, and federal research funding.
In September, campus activism spiked when Trump repealed Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that allowed undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States. Hundreds rallied in Tercentenary Theatre and 31 professors were arrested during a protest in Harvard Square.
Faust, who had written a letter to Trump urging him to keep DACA in August, denounced the repeal as “cruel.” Harvard supported a lawsuit challenging Trump’s decision.
In November, a new threat to University priorities loomed: a Republican tax plan that would tax returns on Harvard’s endowment and that threatened to nix tax-free tuition status for graduate students. Faust named the Republican tax plan the University’s top lobbying priority and graduate students held a phone bank to lobby lawmakers to keep their tuition waivers tax-free.
When Trump signed the tax overhaul into law, graduate students were relieved to find that the tuition provision had been removed—but the University will likely pay tens of millions of dollars annually in an endowment tax Faust called “unprecedented.” In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Faust wrote that Harvard’s tax-related lobbying efforts are far from over.
Much of future advocacy, however, will fall to Faust’s successor after June 2018, the month Faust is slated to step down as University president.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first medical marijuana dispensary ever to hit Harvard Square has officially opened its doors.
Healthy Pharms Inc., a registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary, opened for business within The Red House restaurant at 98 Winthrop St. Saturday. The shop will be open daily from noon to 6 p.m.
The Cambridge location marks the second dispensary run by Healthy Pharms, a Georgetown, Mass.-based business that cultivates and processes its own marijuana.
The opening of the Harvard Square joint follows months of controversy. Some Cambridge residents and store owners previously alleged Healthy Pharms would likely have a negative effect on the area.
One Square businessman—Raj K. Dhanda, the owner of Crimson Galeria—even sued to block the medical marijuana dispensary. Dhanda filed a complaint in federal court against Healthy Pharms in early September, claiming at the time that his businesses have been “substantially injured by a conspiracy to sell marijuana.” The lawsuit is ongoing.
Dhanda declined to comment on the opening of the dispensary. In a phone call Saturday morning, Dhanda said he had nothing to say.
In February, the Cambridge City Council modified the zoning regulations for medical marijuana dispensaries to permit up to "five or six" new dispensaries in the city, as long as each dispensary complies with state and local law. The regulations do not mention federal law.
Healthy Pharms ultimately secured all the required approvals, according to Paul W. Overgaag, the chief financial officer of Healthy Pharms. Overgaag said he was “totally excited” for the store’s opening.
“I hope it will bring more customers for Harvard Square,” he said. “For every one dollar spent on medical marijuana, it is estimated that four dollars are spent in the area around it.”
Though Overgaag said Healthy Pharms plans to keep its Cambridge location open for years to come, he said he recognized that, due to the controversial nature of marijuana, potential problems could light up in future.
“It would be silly of us not to be ready for something to come up,” he said. “You always have to be prepared for something unforeseen.”
Overgaag declined to comment on whether the dispensary may pursue a recreational license going forward. The Massachusetts Legislature gave recreational marijuana shops the green light to begin operating in the state over the summer, but the Cambridge city government is still hashing out the details of how this would work. The body could begin approving recreational licenses in spring 2018.
Overgaag already owns two other properties in the Square: the eatery and bar Charlie’s Kitchen, at 10 Eliot St., and The Red House, the restaurant that now shares its Winthrop St. digs with the dispensary. Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, noted Overgaag has been a property and business owner in the Square for a long time and said she thinks he is “highly respected” in the area.
Jillson said that, when the Business Association board voted on whether or not to support the dispensary, 22 out of 23 board members voted to endorse the concept.
“We are pleased to see that Paul is opening today,” Jillson said. “We look forward to [Healthy Pharms] being a community partner: they have already joined the organization.”
Jillson added she thinks Healthy Pharms will have a positive impact on Harvard Square business.
“We expect that as with all good business, whether retail, restaurant, or medical marijuana dispensary, that giving people options, a variety of options, giving them good reasons to come to the Square, it’s always helpful,” she said.
Though the Square has opened its arms to medical marijuana, Harvard still bans the use of the drug.  According to the student handbook, “federal law prohibits the possession, use, or distribution of marijuana, including for medical purposes, on Harvard property or as part of a Harvard activity.”
Nonetheless, just a few hundred yards from Harvard Yard, Healthy Pharms is growing—and looking to make green.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing in the frigid weather of a Minneapolis winter, the shooting went cold for both Harvard and Minnesota on Saturday—neither team would shoot over 34 percent from the field in a contest that would give the Gophers their fourth consecutive win, 65-55.
With the Crimson’s leading scorer sophomore guard Bryce Aiken out with an injury, Harvard (5-8) struggled to create offense and hold an early lead despite holding Minnesota (12-3) to its lowest scoring total of the season.
Sophomore forward Seth Towns finished the game with 10 points and seven rebounds, but shot 4-20 from the field while missing all of his eight attempts from beyond the arc.
“I thought we came into this afternoon with the thought that if we could really fight and compete together then that would really give us a chance,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we did that, I thought our kids really fought and competed and we didn’t play well enough to win. We really needed that third piece to make it happen, we shot 7-of-32 from three.”
While the Crimson would take a 9-4 lead in the opening minutes, a 13-0 run from the Gophers would prove to be the nail in the coffin for Harvard as Minnesota would hold on to the lead for the remainder of the game.
While early the run gave the Gophers the advantage for good, the Crimson stayed within striking distance for much of the matchup, making up for the cold shooting with the defense that has come to define Amaker’s tenure as head coach. While Harvard had its second worst shooting performance of the season—going 32.8 percent from the field—Minnesota hardly bested the Crimson, shooting 33.3 percent on the day.
“I thought our zone really helped us, we were pretty active in it,” Amaker said. “We didn’t get many easy baskets, and we had a few turnovers in the first half that led to fastbreak opportunities and dunks for them, but other than that I thought we really kept everything in front of us and our zone was really effective in making the shots they were taking pretty tough.”
Though finding the bottom of the net would prove to be difficult for both teams, it was at the charity stripe where the Gophers cemented the win. Harvard was held to a season low eight free-throws, converting six, while Minnesota went to the line 20 times, converting on 18 of those.
“We didn’t get to the foul line nearly enough, only eight times for the whole game,” Amaker said. “You’re not going to be able to win a game like that against a team like that here without making better strides in those categories.”
Despite the early run from the Gophers, the Crimson would cut into Minnesota’s lead late.
Coming out of a timeout after a dunk from sophomore forward Michael Hurt gave the Gophers a ten-point lead, Harvard went to work with just over 10 minutes to go—first it was a jumper from sophomore forward Chris Lewis. Then after holding Minnesota scoreless on ensuing possessions it was Lewis again with a layup. With just over 8 minutes left to play junior sharpshooter Corey Johnson capped the Harvard run with a three to put the Crimson within a possession.
Johnson would finish the matchup with a team high 12 points on 4-of-10 shooting to go with 6 rebounds.
“Guys were just finding me in transition,” Johnson said. “I have confidence in myself to take the shot so if I’m open I’m going to take it and I was fortunate enough to make some today.”
The 7-0 run would put the Crimson within three but it would prove to be as close as Harvard would get in the second half as the Gophers responded with an 8-0 run to put the game out of reach with just over four minutes to go.
“We just did a great job of sticking to the gameplan,” Johnson said. “We did to great job of boxing out, kept out their bigs that are known for their offensive rebounding off the glass. They did a great job of answering our runs and hit some big shots down the stretch and they definitely deserved the win.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Holiday Season has practically everything one can want: family, cheer, and relaxation, to name a few. If you’re a Harvard hockey fan, however, you might want to add mid-December games to your wish list.
After a four-week hiatus for final exams and the holidays, the Crimson icemen were back in action this weekend, squaring off against UMass-Lowell and Vermont in the Catamount Cup.
“It was tough to have that break because I felt like we kind of just started to establish a lot of the things we’d been working on as a group,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But I thought that [this weekend] we got back to that a little bit more.”
Harvard (5-6-1, 4-3-0 ECAC) split the two games, falling to the River Hawks (10-9-0, 6-6-0 Hockey East) on Friday but nabbing a victory over the Catamounts (4-12-3, 4-6-2 Hockey East) the following evening.
The Crimson played without blue-liner Adam Fox this weekend, as the offensive-minded defenseman was busy in Buffalo, N.Y., representing the United States in the IIHF World Junior Championship. This marks Fox’s second appearance in the under-20 tournament, as he missed one game last season to skate for the stars and stripes.
The Jericho, N.Y., native, who is sporting the “A” as an alternate captain for team U.S.A., has been an integral component of Harvard’s defensive corps and a key facilitator on the power play since his very first game in a Crimson sweater. The void he has left, therefore, is noticeable.
“We can just be grateful that our D corps is as strong as it is,” said tri-captain Merrick Madsen. “[Fox’s] calm presence, I’ve never seen it be replicated…. We played strong as a D corps for the most part, and we just have to keep working on improving. If we can do well without Foxy, we’re going to be doing even better with him.”
With or without Fox, Harvard needs to make up ground in the ECAC after a disappointing string of games before the holiday break. This weekend’s split against two Hockey East foes keeps the Crimson below .500.
HARVARD 4, VERMONT 1
After an action-packed first period, which saw the Crimson leave the ice with a 3-1 lead, Harvard’s bout with the Catamounts remained uneventful until junior forward Ryan Donato potted an empty-netter late in the final frame to seal the victory.
With the casual wrister on the open goal, Donato completed his second hat-trick of the season. Back on December 1st, the Boston Bruins prospect likewise capped off a trio of goals with an empty-net tally.
“The power play got us off to a good start,” said coach Donato, spreading the praise instead of dwelling on his son’s stellar performance. “Then [the top] line made some plays—all three of them. It was a good effort all around.”
Donato also picked up an assist on sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce’s power play goal in the opening minutes of the game. Near the blue line, Pelton-Byce received the puck from defenseman Reilly Walsh and skated down to the right circle. A cross-ice give-and-go with Donato, who was stationed in his usual left-circle office, gave the sophomore time and space to put one past freshman net-minder Tyler Harmon.
Along with the hat-trick, the apple gave Donato his first four-point night of the season. Last year, the junior had four such performances.
Saturday marked Madsen’s return to his usual post between the pipes for the Crimson. Coach Donato decided to swap Madsen in for junior Michael Lackey after giving the back-up three straight starts.
“There’s a comfort in knowing that we have not just two, but probably three guys that could be Division-I starters,” Madsen said. “For myself, it felt like a tough time the last month or so. I think it was good to get a reset with the break and everything. I just told myself I want to come back, and the next opportunity I have, I’m going to make the most of it.”
Lackey’s strong play against Quinnipiac and Princeton at the start of December (2-0-0, 2.00 GAA, .941 SV%) fueled a bit of a goaltender battle for the starting spot. After a team-wide lackluster performance on Friday night, coach Donato handed the starting role back to Madsen, who started all 36 contests last season for Harvard, for Saturday’s game.
While coach Donato did not reveal his net-minder plans moving forward, expect the Harvard bench boss to more readily yank a struggling backstop, as both have proven that they are capable starters.
“I don’t think we were fully committed [to a given goaltender] coming into the weekend,” coach Donato said. “We’re going to make a decision on every night and go with the guy that gives us the best chance to win. I don’t want to commit to anything but that. That’s what the guys expect…that guys will get rewarded for good play.”
In his first game back, Madsen looked solid, rejecting all but one of Vermont’s 28 attempts (1.00 GAA, .964 SV%). The Catamounts’ sole tally came early in the first period, after sophomore forward Ross Colton buried a rebound and spoiled Madsen’s initial sprawling save on a wrap-around attempt.
The Vermont goal evened the game after Pelton-Byce’s early strike. Five minutes later, though, Donato’s first snipe of the night restored Harvard’s lead and was ultimately the game-winner for the Crimson.
UMASS-LOWELL 5, HARVARD 2
On Friday night, Harvard also jumped on the opposition early in the first frame. Donato took all of 32 seconds to ink the score sheet, giving his Crimson the early 1-0 lead.
Freshman forward Henry Bowlby backhanded a puck toward the cage, where junior goaltender Chris Hernberg left a long rebound for Donato. The Scituate, Mass., native sent a wrister off the crossbar and into the net.
Harvard’s lead, however, was fleeting. The squad enjoyed the advantage for all of three minutes before junior forward Nick Master notched the game for UMass-Lowell. The Crimson would never regain the lead, as the River Hawks seized control of the game in the second period with an early tally from captain Tyler Meuller.
“We got off to a good start and through two periods played pretty decently,” coach Donato said. “We certainly had some chances that we didn’t execute on.”
Hernberg posted multiple acrobatic saves in the second frame, making it difficult for Harvard to claw back into the contest. He did cave once more, though, this time to tri-captain Eddie Ellis.
Sophomore forward Colton Kerfoot, in just his fourth appearance of the season, fed Ellis a nice centering pass from behind the goal. The senior had his hands free and buried the puck for his first strike of the year.
“[The bottom] line has been working hard and it was a big goal to get the game tied at two,” coach Donato said. “They’ve certainly had some chances, and it was nice to see a lot of [Eddie’s] hard work pay off for him.”
Despite the fourth line’s effort to equalize the game, UMass-Lowell tilted the ice in its favor in the third period, outshooting the Crimson 14-2 and potting two more goals, including the empty-netter.
“I thought the third period was our worst,” coach Donato reflected. “We took a couple of penalties, and we allowed the fourth goal to make it a two-goal game…. Our overall execution and determination needed to be a lot better.”
This final-frame disparity in attempts caused Harvard to be outshot for just the third time all year.
With the goal on Friday and the four-point effort the following evening, Donato extends his point streak to 12 games—the length of the season.
Donato’s streak is one of the few positives the team can take away from this weekend, as Harvard still sits well below where it wants to be in the standings. To make up ground, coach Donato’s squad needs to build sizable winning streaks.
“Obviously, to stay over .500, you have to be able to string some wins together,” Madsen said. “[J-term] is a great opportunity for us to buckle down and string a few together. Historically, J-term has been a time where we’ve usually had to kind of reset, and I’m hoping that maybe this year we can use this as an opportunity to make a jump in the league as opposed to dropping games.”
After nine straight games away from home—a road stretch spanning two months—the Crimson, still in pursuit of .500, will finally return to Cambridge next weekend for tilts with RPI and Union.

 Dear Professor Whom I Cannot Name Due to Fear of the Ad-Board, 
Hi. You may not know me because I did not go to office hours and am in the bottom twentieth percentile of your class. I just want you to know that I am sincerely disappointed that I have not yet received my final course grade. I diligently crammed my Q in at 11:57 p.m. on the 20th of December, and I fully expected you to keep up your end of the deal and give me my grade before 2018. 
My parents (and I) question my legitimacy as a Harvard student as is. Do you really expect them to believe me when I tell them that my grade has not been posted yet? They are going to immediately assume that I tanked my GPA and am just scared to tell them. Yes, I understand that this is a fair assessment and will likely be the outcome I face after you actually give me my grade, but I would really appreciate you not tarnishing my character in the eyes of my parents.
If I can learn a millennium of ancient philosophy in six hours while wired on Red Bull and cold Fogbuster, you can give me a C over the span of two weeks. I am sorry if I sound needy now. It’s just that I am needy. There is a void in my heart and my transcript, and it is all your fault.
 Three Crying Emojis,Everyone
