After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the Republican presidential primary heats up and candidates start scrounging for cash, one of the first choices facing them will be whether to accept public financing. On the one hand, the program is a good deal, especially for dark horse candidates without big networks of donors. If a candidate raises $100,000 in small donations from at least 20 states, the government will match up to $250 of every further donation to that candidate for the primary’s duration.
But the deal comes with strings attached. Candidates have to obey national and state-level spending limits for the primary’s duration, and also cannot spend more than a small amount from their personal funds, which for wealthy candidates like Mitt Romney will be a deal breaker, as it was for him in 2008.
Perhaps more crucially for Republican candidates, however, is that party’s ever-selective deficit hawks have set their sights on public funding as a source of budget cuts. This past January, the Republican House voted to abolish the public finance system for presidential elections, despite the fact that this would only save about $52 million a year, a rounding error in the context of the overall federal budget. What’s more, all of that money is contributed voluntarily, through a checkbox on the personal income tax allowing filers to donate $3 to fund elections.
That said, Republicans are far from the only guilty party. President Obama set a bad precedent in 2008 when he became the first candidate ever to reject public funding for the general election. He then proceeded to spend nearly three times as much as John McCain on TV advertisements, sending the signal that giving up on public funds gives campaigns a big leg up.
The public financing system will lose its bite if, due to Obama’s success or Republicans’ ideological stance, it becomes the norm for candidates to reject it. In particular, its spending limits will become toothless, as the Supreme Court has ruled mandatory campaign spending caps unconstitutional. That is, if campaigns opt out of public funding, the government has no levers with which to keep their spending under control.
Of course, the Supreme Court has also reduced the government’s ability to stop campaign spending even when candidates do accept public funds. The court’s ruling in the Citizens United case that corporations can spend unlimited amounts on third-party political expenditures led to a fivefold increase in third-party campaign spending in 2010, a trend which is likely to continue into 2012.
Even if a candidate accepts public funding, then, they can just get their corporate supporters to spend in excess of the spending limits imposed by public financing. Candidates don’t even need to reject public financing anymore to make the system toothless.
Supporters of campaign finance reform, then, are in a bit of a fix. The current system is totally incapable of keeping large amounts of corporate money out of elections, and a stricter regime, with, say, non-voluntary spending limits and a ban on corporate spending, will not withstand a court challenge.
Some reformers, like Harvard Law Professor Lawrence Lessig, have expressed interest in amending the Constitution to enshrine Congress’ ability to regulate campaign finance. I understand the impulse, but the likelihood of such an amendment passing is trivially low, even without the current Republican majorities in the House and state legislatures. A better approach would seek ways, within the Supreme Court’s current interpretation of the Constitution, to regulate campaign spending.
Thankfully, Stanford Law Professor Kathleen M. Sullivan has proposed just such a third way. Her approach has three steps. The first is the abolition of all federal regulations governing elections, except those requiring transparency. This means no more limits to what an individual or any other group can give to campaigns, and no spending caps associated with public financing.
Anyone can give any amount to any campaign, and campaigns can use it however they like. This means that instead of creating third-party groups, corporations can give directly to candidates, who can then be held accountable for all spending undertaken on their behalf.
The second step is much strengthened disclosure. So, if Wal-Mart decides to give a sympathetic Senate candidate $50 million, they can—but the world has to know about it, and if they disapprove, Wal-Mart loses business. Finally, Sullivan proposes public financing for all elections, not just the presidential race. That way, every candidate will have enough to get their message out, and will not need corporate backing to get their foot in the door.
Now, it’s possible that campaigns will still engage in funding arms races, with public funds as just a small portion of their arsenal. But maybe not. Fundraising is a miserable activity that politicians universally despise. Given the choice between spending hours on the phones, dialing for dollars they do not absolutely need, and spending time with their family, I suspect most would choose the latter. It is worth noting that Australia and Germany have adopted roughly this system and have very clean political processes to show for it.
Republicans may balk at the public funding necessary for the proposal to work, but the potential for easier and less frequent fundraising may draw them in yet. If it does, the result would be a campaign finance system with which we can all live.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sitting on the steps of Memorial Hall overlooking Harvard Yard, I read through my notes on microeconomics in preparation for my summer program  final, all the while listening to a passing tour recounting Harry Widener’s exploits and the traditions governing the Yard during Commencement. I kept pinching myself at the thought of having reached this pinnacle of academic learning and the real prospect of graduating in a year’s time. I was caught between my own quiet reflection while simultaneously being an actor in this most grand of scholarly environments.
Graduation would be a majestic affair. The thought of being escorted through the winding lanes of Cambridge from the Kennedy School to the Yard by the sounds of a bagpiper was enough to give me goosebumps. I thought of the regalia of our degree, our joining the ranks of elite Harvard men and women having come before us since 1636, and the arrival of those dearest to us in Cambridge from all over the world to applaud and share in our accomplishment. There was pride for sure—for one master’s degree candidate colleague this had been a dream in the making for 40 years—but it was hopefully not false pride, checked in any case by a keen sense of humility in being a small part of such brilliance of thought, of tradition, of Veritas.
When graduation finally arrived, expectations were resoundingly trumped by an experience that was very different. Some friends thought they would be overwhelmed to tears, but there was only joy, laughter, and good camaraderie. If our procession was to be an orderly, reflective affair, it was anything but. Just about everyone broke ranks, eager to share the moment with colleagues soon to be dispersed all over the world, talking over bells chiming in our honour, almost oblivious to the traffic making way for us. The bagpiper? I said hello at the start and then must have fallen too far behind in the progression to hear much more than a murmur of a sound foreign to our experience.
Only a Japanese friend called for more sobriety when at the Yard, when we started thumping our Earth-modelled balloons up to the air in celebration following President Drew G. Faust’s investiture of Kennedy School graduates. My friend made sure he caught his balloon and held onto it as if it were some prized possession. I belted mine away, and catching as many as came my way, sent them off again on their merry way in quick succession. With whose balloon I remained in the end, after how many rounds it went up and down and from hand to hand, is hardly the point; the significance was that the little miniature globes went around, which in our context represented taking a voyage around the world.
“You take care of my soul sister,” were my parting words to a graduating American colleague married to a classmate from Latin America during our time at Harvard. This was more than friendship; the ties binding many of us more properly befitted a family. She still had a year to go. We envied them; even for the stale food and crammed lunch queues at The Forum’s cafeteria. There was always the possibility of extending the program, but graduation beckoned, less so the life after, in the depths of a recession not seen since 1929. The noise filling those hallowed halls of learning, our soirees at each other’s digs or out on the tennis court which also witnessed the “popping” sound of my torn Achilles tendon, could not be replayed. It was time to move on, knowing that by doing so we would remain.
Graduation, as the culmination and arguably the ultimate representation of our time at Harvard, was about being on stage. As actors and actresses in a hugely dynamic and fast-paced play that was much of our own creation — principally through the relationships that bind us still to that time and place — we were rarely observers. And when we did look, we did so as insiders, like the photographers amongst us at graduation. Observing became part of the act. And the act was always real, because we were authentic; the costume we sported at graduation was worn with naturalness, without pomp or show. That was what earning our crimson and black meant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Facebook “like” button officially cemented its iconic status (pun intended) earlier this month when an Israeli couple named their baby “Like” after it. Complete with celebrity status as a tattoo on T-pain’s forearm, the thumbs-up button labeled “like” has become ubiquitous both online and off.
The phenomenon began with a series of changes over the years that have made the “like” button emblematic of Facebook interactions. The “become a fan” button on celebrity and company pages was replaced by the “like” button, and users can now “like” not only photos and wall posts but even comments. The act of “lik[ing]” is important outside of Facebook, the button is now a fixture on over 2.5 million websites, on which a single click will allow users to share content on Facebook. Some estimate that the button receives as many as 65 million clicks per day.
The appeal of the “like” button lies in its simplicity. It is self-expression with minimal effort, allowing us to communicate with just one click. Indeed, some now use the “like” button to not only supplement but replace regular wall posts: in response to my questions about her well-being, a friend acknowledged my wall post with a plain, so-and-so “likes this.” It is often used as a conversation ender; it’s polite but impossible to respond to, guaranteeing a swift and positive end to the exchange.
However,  in the age of cliched abbreviations such as “FTW,” “FML,” and “tl;dr,” the “like” button feels like another oversimplification of otherwise more complex and meaningful conversations. It is much easier to like a status than to write a comment, and it is true that some “likes” need no elaboration. But when we use the “like” button, we are no longer being creative by combing our minds for witty or insightful remarks to post. Even at its best, “like” is nothing but a canned response that lines up neatly next to the six other identical “likes” on any given post or article.
Not only does it lack originality, but overuse of the “like” button also threatens our engagement with information online and in real life. When we compose a comment, we are compelled to actually think about why we feel a need to respond to an image or message. Liking a post allows us to bypass this thought process. It is all the sentiment without the thought, the online equivalent of the conversational “that’s nice” that we sometimes halfheartedly throw out when we are not really listening.
The trend toward clicking the “like” button is worrying not the least because “likes” are not reflective of what real conversations are like. Real-life interactions require us to do more than just show a thumbs-up of approval; we must not only articulate our preferences but also give reasons to support these viewpoints. One wonders if the current generations growing up with the culture of “like” will struggle with communicating with more than short catchphrases like “I like it,” and “I approve,” even more than I already have trouble coming up with descriptors other than “cool” and “awesome.”
So next time, stop for a moment before clicking on that “Like” button and consider leaving a comment instead. Your friend will appreciate it more, and you will be practicing the real-life virtues of creativity and engagement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the start of this year, I was asked by a fellow freshman whether Pakistan bordered Indiana. When I replied in the negative, he wondered what state Pakistan was next to. Given the events of the last few weeks, I am sure this individual now knows where Pakistan is located on a map. He probably knows a lot of other things about Pakistan too. Unfortunately, what he now knows about Pakistan is not fully representative of the country. There are two sides to every story and I wish to divulge the story less told.
Pakistan is a complex country. It is one with tremendous natural beauty, enviable natural wealth, a thriving population and enormous potential. Instead of garnering global recognition for its economic and societal potential, Pakistan has recently attracted scorn from the rest of the world. A new low was reached on May 2, when Osama bin Laden, was discovered and killed in the garrison city of Abbotabad, a few dozen miles from the country’s capital and a stone’s throw from Pakistan’s Military Academy. Many questions remain unanswered. Was Pakistan incompetent enough to overlook bin Laden’s hideout? If not, was there a degree of complicity amongst the ranks of the country’s military? While many in the United States government believe Pakistan played both sides, conclusive evidence of such actions has not yet surfaced. Given the complex relationship between Pakistan and the West and currently heightened tensions, I suspect these questions will remain largely unanswered.
I can say this though: Pakistan’s resolve against terror is steadfast. We have lost 35,000 men, women and children in this War on Terror. Our armed forces have suffered upwards of 9,000 casualties. Our infrastructure has been damaged, our markets have been bombed and our schools attacked. We have suffered more from this war than any other nation. On May 13, close to a hundred new graduates of the Frontier Constabulary, a paramilitary force patrolling the tumultuous northwest of Pakistan, were brutally massacred by two suicide bombers while boarding busses to take them home for their first vacation as recruits. Despite such suffering, we march on. Our army is engaged in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), a region that straddles the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan; before army intervention, FATA had become a militant stronghold. On television, reporters who interview those on the street invariably come across children who want to join the military and fight those spreading terror in Pakistan. In late 2009, according to a Gallup Pakistan poll, only 13% opposed military action in FATA. We are a brave nation: military personnel, policemen and women and journalists (not to mention civilians) leave home every morning, not completely certain about their return. And yet, our commitment is unwavering. We know that our potential will never come to fruition unless we rid ourselves of this cancerous terror.
Given the current state of our relationship with the United States, our fight has become harder, not easier. Pakistan has stubbornly supported the United States in the War on Terror. As President Obama has acknowledged, more militants have been caught or killed on Pakistan’s soil than anywhere else in the world. We are honoring our friendship, although history impels us to remain wary.
The United States has a record of turning its back on Pakistan. Going back to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, when Pakistan lost half its country to what became Bangladesh, the United States remained neutral despite Pakistan playing an influential role in Cold War events. Moving forward, with help from the United States, Pakistan orchestrated the Soviet Union’s defeat in Afghanistan, bringing the end to an empire aggressive towards the United States. The consequences and aftermath of war are never pleasant for a region. Making matters worse, the entire leadership of Pakistan died in a mysterious plane crash in August 1988, weeks before the Soviets withdrew their last troops from Afghanistan. Tragically, instead of aiding Pakistan through the aftermath of the Soviet-Afghan War, the United States pulled out of the region and forced Pakistan to recover from its massive losses on its own. Elements of that ineffective recovery, and the United States’ mistake are part of today’s dilemma.
Pakistan is at a critical juncture on its road to progress. Breaking from its historical trend, the United States needs to play a positive role in Pakistan’s future. We may need aid in the short-term, but we want trade in the long-term. We may need a hand in the short-term, but we want to stand on our own in the long-term. Our relationship should be based on regional stability and economic progress, not duplicity and economic reliance. The United States has to protect its national interest, but so does Pakistan. Pakistan wants to help itself and the world; in order to do that, several mistakes need to be corrected. But the United States needs to stand by us, on equal footing, as an ally should.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the financial markets unraveled in the fall of 2008, politicians and media pundits scrambled to find someone to blame for the panic engulfing global economies, and 1986 Harvard Kennedy School graduate Daniel H. Mudd found himself among the many thrust into the spotlight.
Mudd served as the CEO of Fannie Mae—an originally government-sponsored enterprise which expanded the secondary mortgage market by creating mortgage-backed securities—from 2005 to 2008.
“I was the CEO of the company and I accept responsibility for everything that happened on my watch,” Mudd said before a congressional investigative panel in April 2010.
But Mudd’s path from Harvard’s doors to the top of the corporate ladder was in many ways an unexpected one—and he maintains that despite the calamities that marked his tenure at Fannie Mae, he always sought to be a responsible steward of the organization.
FROM SERVICE TO SCHOOL
Mudd’s life in the early years following his graduation from the University of Virginia were marked by his interest in public service.
Mudd joined the military after college, and became a decorated officer in the U.S. Marine Corps.
“He found himself leading a platoon into a bunker in Beirut, and I’m sure he would not have wanted his path to have been something other than serving his country,” says Gordon Runté, who worked with Mudd at Fannie Mae and now works at Fortress Investment Group, LLC, where Mudd is the current CEO.
After his time in the Marine Corps, Mudd decided to return to school to pursue his interest in public administration.
Mudd says he chose Harvard in part because he wanted to take advantage of the opportunities not only at the Kennedy School, but at the other Harvard graduate schools as well.
“Boston and Cambridge are terrific places to go to school. I had a number of good friends in the graduate and law schools—all those things made it the perfect time and place for me to learn and study there,” Mudd says.
Speaking of his two years at the Kennedy School, Mudd cites, among others, a leadership course taught by Marty Linsky and Ron Heifetz as one of his most memorable classes.
According to those who have worked with him, Mudd’s management style reflects the commitment to leadership he nurtured at HKS.
“When people read the myth of Dan the Marine, it’s really true—the integrity, the intellect, the toughness. He has all the basics in spades,” says Runté. “He exemplifies leadership in full—a real life composite of the types of people he probably studied at the Kennedy School, but whom you rarely encounter in real life.”
LANDING AT FANNIE MAE
With a Masters in Public Administration in hand and experience working in the Pentagon, Mudd’s long-term goal after graduate school, as he recalls, was to pursue a career in government.
Working in business was to be a stepping-stone to public policy, Mudd says.
“It became clear to me that an important aspect of policy was understanding how the business side of the economy works—where you made payroll and business decisions,” Mudd says. “I thought I would go and do that for a few years and probably return to government.”
But after taking a job at General Electric Capital, Mudd’s experience in the world of finance took him through “increasing positions of responsibility” until he finally arrived at Fannie Mae in February 2000, having previously served as President of GE Capital Asia-Pacific from 1996 to 1999.
For Mudd, the job at Fannie Mae was a partial realization of his early desire to work in government.
Furthermore, Mudd says he found his education at the Kennedy School to be particularly useful during his employment in this form of “quasi-government service.”
“My background in political management of multiple departments, the federal rule-making process, and the way the government works in general turned out helpful,” says Mudd about his tenure at the company.
THE HOUSING CRISIS
Mudd’s path at Fannie Mae took an unexpected turn in 2004 when the chairman of Fannie Mae, Franklin D. Raines ’71, as well as the chief financial officer, J. Timothy Howard, stepped down following an investigation of Fannie by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mudd was subsequently named interim CEO of Fannie, and later assumed the position of President and CEO in June 2005.
Speaking retrospectively about Fannie’s move towards riskier mortgage lending under his leadership, Mudd says he feels that he did the best he could with the situation that was thrust upon him after his predecessors’ sudden departure.
“I had to take a company that was in crisis when I took over and get it out of that crisis,” Mudd says.
But not long afterward, the full destructive potential of mass defaults on subprime mortgages gradually dawned on the financial world.
And when the federal government stepped in to become Fannie’s conservator in 2008, the company—much like many of the nation’s investment banks—found itself at the center of national attention.
Mudd was forced to step down in the process.
While some argue that Fannie Mae played a significant role in developing an unstable housing market, F.M. Scherer, HKS professor emeritus of public policy and corporate management, says he believes that Fannie Mae is not one of the institutions primarily responsible for the financial crisis.
“My impression is that Fannie Mae was a laggard, not a leader, in moving to the crisis,” Scherer says. “The key factor is that they joined the collateral debt obligations parade relatively late, and in joining, they contributed to it, but they were not the leaders.”
Despite many public critiques of his leadership at Fannie Mae, Mudd staunchly defends his actions.
“I feel that I did the best I could, that it wasn’t perfect, and I always dealt with that in a straightforward and honorable way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When 1986 Nobel laureate and Harvard professor emeritus Dudley R. Herschbach was 11 years old, he discovered an issue of National Geographic during a visit to his grandmother’s house. Inside the magazine, the young scientist found “gorgeous” star maps—designed by Donald H. Menzel, former chair of the Harvard Astronomy department—that Herschbach says sparked his interest in science.
Though Herschbach, at that time a farm boy in rural California, had never heard of Harvard, he would later become not only a Junior Fellow and a Nobel Prize-winning chemist at the same institution as Menzel, but also a House master and an inspirational mentor for many students.
A SCIENTIFIC “GENIUS”
As an undergraduate, Herschbach received a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Stanford University. After completing college, he stayed in Palo Alto for another year to get a master’s degree in chemistry before moving to Cambridge, where he would earn a master’s in physics and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from Harvard.
Herschbach was also a gifted athlete. He was recruited to Stanford as a football player—though he chose to take an academic scholarship instead—and was invited to try out for the Los Angeles Rams in his sophomore year. Herschbach turned down the offer in favor of continuing his education.
The young man’s scientific potential was recognized early in his career. In 1957, shortly before he received his Ph.D., Herschbach was awarded a Harvard Junior Fellowship—an accolade honoring “exceptional ability, originality, resourcefulness ... and intellectual achievement” in young scholars. The fellowship allows recipients to freely pursue research at Harvard for three years, according to the Society of Fellows website.
In the years that followed, Herschbach proved to be an extremely prolific scientist, publishing over 400 scholarly articles over the duration of his career.
But his most noteworthy achievement was his research using crossed molecular beams, which won him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1986.
With co-recipients Yuan T. Lee and John C. Polanyi, the Harvard professor showed that scientists could use molecular beams to understand the specific mechanisms of a chemical reaction, such as the orientations of the colliding molecules.
Before Herschbach’s discovery, chemists could only deduce a general picture of chemical processes. But despite the extraordinary potential of his research, Herschbach says that many other scientists were dubious, referring to it as “lunatic fringe chemistry.”
Overcoming this skepticism, Herschbach’s research team achieved what they had envisioned. He says their discovery provided scientists with important knowledge that allows them to work across scientific fields and integrate information from chemistry, physics, and biology.
A “TRANSFORMATIVE” MENTOR
Herschbach’s students describe the professor as a warm and inspirational man with a contagious enthusiasm for knowledge—something he attributes to the circumstances of his upbringing.
Growing up in San Jose, Calif., Herschbach says he never expected to go to college. As a boy, he milked cows and raised livestock in his rural hometown.
“We didn’t know any scientists,” he says. “We didn’t even know anyone who had gone to college.”
Herschbach says his farm-bred perspective allows him to instill in his students a passion for learning.
“My whole life is a result of getting to go to college,” he says. “It’s a fairy tale.”
Timothy C. Germann, a research scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, performed his graduate research under Herschbach’s tutelage. He says that while the Nobel laureate is a brilliant scientist, it was Herschbach’s enthusiasm and support that was instrumental in helping him successfully finish his thesis.
“[Herschbach’s] energy, his excitement—that mattered more than the specific research project,” Germann says.
Chair of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford Richard N. Zare ’61, who researched molecular beams with Herschbach as a graduate student, says his mentor had a significant impact on his life and career path.
“I had the feeling that I was working with a genius,” Zare says. “It was transformative for me to be with him.”
“ZANY AND WISE”
Herschbach has also left his mark on Harvard students as an instructor committed to science education.
When he taught Chemistry 10, a large introductory chemistry course, Herschbach says he used unconventional methods, such as including historical and philosophical context—and a poetry contest—within the curriculum, earning the class the nickname of “Chem Zen.”
After he retired in 2009 and was given the title of professor emeritus, Herschbach continued to inspire students by teaching a freshman seminar on nanotechnology.
Nicholas P. Stanford ’12, one of Herschbach’s seminar students, says Herschbach emphasized the importance of learning from peers who are passionate about a scientific topic.
“I would say that he is a combination of zany and wise,” says Stanford.
When he and his classmates went to see their professor speak in Currier House—where Herschbach and his wife, Georgene, served as house masters from 1981 to 1986—Stanford recalls that many important people lined up to speak with the Nobel laureate.
“But [Herschbach] wanted to talk to us about our research,” Stanford said. “It showed that he cared deeply for his students.”
While Herschbach no longer teaches in a classroom setting, he remains committed to education. He frequently attends science talent searches because he finds the young scientists inspiring, he says.
He is also an active advocate for the advancement of women in science. According to his wife, Herschbach understands the importance of including women on the faculty and was responsible for recruiting the first woman to the chemistry department at Harvard in 1979.
Anita Goel—Herschbach’s last Ph.D. student and the current Chairman, Scientific Director, and CEO of Nanobiosym, Inc.—says the Nobel laureate encourages his students to take scientific risks.
“He recognizes and cultivates brilliance,” she says. “He always used to say, ‘You know, you should behave like you’ve already won the Nobel Prize before you have it, and then after you have won the Nobel behave like you don’t have it.’”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost exactly 25 years ago, Jeffrey A. Zucker ’86 was in the middle of his graduation ceremony at Mather House when he received a phone call. It was NBC. The network hired him later that day as a researcher for the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.
Zucker’s phone has been ringing off the hook ever since. As one of America’s most prominent television executives, Zucker quickly ascended the ranks at NBC, and was named President and CEO in 2007 at just 41 years old.
But friends and colleagues say that the intelligence, drive, and ambition which have served Zucker in his career were evident long before he began his explosive rise in the television industry.
A HUNGRY UNDERGRAD
Zucker’s passion for media first developed as a young man growing up in southeast Florida. In high school, he not only served as editor of the school newspaper, but also worked as a freelance reporter for The Miami Herald and attended Northwestern University’s prestigious High School Institute for journalists.
Steven A. Nussbaum ’86, his freshman and sophomore year roommate at Harvard, describes Zucker’s interest in writing as practically palpable.
“Jeff was extremely focused and driven,” Nussbaum says. “From the day he arrived at Harvard, he knew he wanted to write for The Crimson.”
Entering his first comp meeting for the publication’s sports section, Zucker was immediately sized up by Michael J. Bass ’83, the sports editor at the time.
“He was a scrawny kid from Miami who wore a down coat starting in October and was already a helluva good writer,” says Bass. “My first impressions were that he was smart as hell, creative, a bit cocky, and had a determination to succeed that was unbelievable.”
Another Crimson writer, Rebecca H. Hartman Edwards ’85, says she sought to mentor the ambitious freshman.
“I was a year older and took him under my wing ... or so I thought,” she says. “In less than a year, he was the Sports Editor, handing out my assignments and editing my copy.”
Edwards also lived in Mather House with Zucker, casting him as a janitor in the house’s soap opera parody, “Mathering Heights.” This willingness to partake in a playful theatrical role underscored the balance between Zucker’s intense drive and love of having fun.
Later becoming President of The Crimson, he continued the storied rivalry with The Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. Zucker even once caught Lampoon President Conan O’Brien ’85 stealing copies of the newspaper and had him arrested.
“It all seems a little silly in hindsight, like college hijinks, but back then it seemed important and fun,” Zucker says.
PURSUING THE DREAM
Bass went to work for ABC Sports as an Olympics researcher after graduation, and invited Zucker to take a freelance job covering the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles during the summer after his sophomore year.
“I was the writer for the morning show with Frank Gifford and Kathleen Sullivan, and Jeff was my sidekick and we had a blast. He was definitely bitten by the TV bug,” Bass says.
Two years later, Bass had moved to NBC to work on the 1988 Olympics and reached out to Zucker again, hiring him as a researcher.
Referring to the transition from print journalism to television, Zucker says, “I love TV—the reach and breadth of it—so that was incredibly intoxicating.”
Deferring an acceptance to law school at the University of Virginia, Zucker dove headfirst into his position at NBC. He became executive producer of The Today Show in 1992, NBC Entertainment President in 2000, NBC CEO in 2005, and finally President and CEO of NBC Universal in 2007, a position he held until fall 2010, when Comcast took over the network and opted to bring in its own leadership team.
During Zucker’s time at NBC, he played an important role in shaping The Today Show, introducing outdoor concerts on the show and collaborating with Bass to craft a new segment entitled “Where in the World is Matt Lauer?” These innovations propelled the show to the number one program in its time slot, a position it has held for over 15 years.
Among his other projects, Zucker launched hits like The Apprentice, introduced “super-sized” comedy episodes extended from thirty minutes to an hour, and worked with Fox to develop the streaming video website Hulu.
With NBC’s cable channels CNBC and MSNBC raking in strong profits at the time of his departure, the main criticism of Zucker’s tenure at the network was the drop in primetime ratings. In an interview with The New York Times in September 2010, he cited “not moving quickly enough” on improving NBC Entertainment as his biggest mistake.
WORK HARD, PLAY HARD
Allison L. Gollust, Zucker’s publicist since their work together on The Today Show, recalls the diligent leadership Zucker brought to the company.
“He works incredibly hard, longer hours than anyone I know. And he can get done in a day what it would take most people three days to accomplish,” she says.
But Gollust also notes that Zucker’s leadership was marked by compassion for his employees.
“He is famously known for giving everyone he works with a nickname,” she says. “He kept a softball team going for most of his years at NBC. He believed in working hard and playing hard too.”
Zucker lists his four children as his proudest personal achievement and the “totality of his 25 years at NBC” as his most notable professional one. In addition to skyrocketing to the position of top executive, Zucker has battled two bouts of colon cancer, without missing a beat at work.
“I’ve never had a day off since I graduated from college,” Zucker says, “So I’m enjoying this first opportunity to take some time and think about what I really want to do. I’m still interested in media, I’m interested in digital, and I’m interested in government service.”
According to Gollust, his fierce commitment to success remains coupled with a genuinely jovial personality and devotion to friends, family, and colleagues. She recalls that when he made the decision to leave The Today Show and announced his decision, most of the people in the room began to cry.
“I have never seen a room react like that one did,” she says. “I often say that the people who work closely with Jeff would lay down in front of a bus for him. He earns their loyalty, their friendship, and their respect.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard was up by three or four points, but its lead against the Princeton men’s basketball team was dwindling fast, recalls former guard Keith W. Webster ’87.
Webster’s teammate, current Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86, suddenly caught the ball as it nearly soared out of bounds near the half-court line. The 6’5” Chicago native held the ball for only a split-second before releasing it towards the distant hoop.
“When he shot it, I didn’t even watch the ball, I just kept staring at him like ‘What are you doing?’” Webster says. “It was the most absurd shot in the world.”
With an elegant swish, it was also a game-changing three-pointer, leading Harvard to victory that night.
Close friends and eventual co-captains Duncan and Webster were heading back over the Charles River an hour later, loaded down with winter gear and athletic bags, when Webster turned to Duncan and asked, “By the way, what the hell was that shot?”
Webster says that he’ll never forget Duncan’s answer.
“I knew if I made it, it would break their backs,” Webster recalls Duncan saying. According to Webster, Duncan’s insight and confidence in that game were illustrative of his driven, perceptive nature.
“He was one of the smartest players that ever played,” Webster says. “He knew exactly what he was doing.”
Between Duncan’s Sociology studies, a “Big Brother” mentoring role, and an indefatigable drive to improve on the court, Duncan impressed peers and teammates alike with his tireless work ethic and devotion to making those around him successful. These same qualities, friends say, have guided Duncan since his 2009 appointment to President Barack Obama’s Cabinet.
“He loves education, he loves helping the community and society,” Webster explains. “I knew that whatever he was going to do, he would cast a wide web and have a large influence on as many people as he could touch.”
POUNDING THE PAVEMENT
Duncan arrived at Harvard in 1982 and went straight to basketball tryouts.
“When Arne came to Harvard, he wasn’t a great player, he was a good player—but he had a tremendous work ethic,” recalls Frank McLaughlin, one of Duncan’s former coaches.
After a year on junior varsity, in which Duncan worked out at the gym early in the morning, ran drills late into the night, and often practiced between classes, Duncan made varsity in his sophomore year.
“I think the way he was wired, his DNA, said that in order to be successful you had to put the time in,” Webster says.
Both McLaughlin and Peter Roby, another former Harvard coach, remember Duncan as a dedicated, unselfish player who always put the team first—and almost never missed a free throw.
Roby says Duncan transitioned from a quiet force to a more vocal leader over his undergraduate years, noting that he could break the tension in the locker room with witty one-liners, and that he loved to listen to music.
“I think the interesting thing is that Arne liked hip-hop music, which nowadays is much more mainstream,” Webster says, with a laugh.
A REAL MORAL FORCE
Webster and Duncan became fast friends, and could often be found trekking across the river to practice—whether or not the team was scheduled to work out that day.
Sometimes a third individual would join Duncan and Webster on these walks: Duncan’s “Little Brother,” a mentee he worked with through a Phillips Brooks House Association program.
“That was a big part of his life,” Webster recalls, noting that whether in high school, college, or playing professional basketball in Australia—which Duncan did from 1987 to 1991—the future Secretary always worked with youth in a mentorship role.
Indeed, before ascending to the national arena, he worked with students in Chicago charter schools like the Ariel Community Academy.
“The students adored him not only because they were fully aware and appreciated his concerns about improving their education, but also because he made them feel special and important as individuals,” writes Kennedy School professor William J. Wilson—who knew Duncan in the 1990s—in an email to the Crimson.
His approach to working with young people resonates with the description of Duncan’s values provided by his Resident Dean in Leverett House, Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who is now the Dean of Freshmen.
“[Duncan] was a real moral force—everybody seemed to know him, and he created a real presence,” says Dingman. “He cared a lot about trying to make a more even playing field and sticking up for underrepresented groups.”
SOCIOLOGICALLY SPEAKING
Growing up as an eager scholar-athlete in Chicago’s Hyde Park, Duncan was introduced to the world of education by both his father, a professor at the University of Chicago, and his mother, who ran an after-school program at which Duncan tutored.
Sociology professor Orlando Patterson notes that in Duncan’s day, the department experienced an ideological shift away from the “prevailing wisdom” that class background was the decisive factor in a student’s educational performance.
“Arne Duncan has strongly emphasized that schools make a big difference regardless of the background of the students,” Patterson says. “I think that we, already [in the 80s], in our department were ... emphasizing that schools and neighborhoods can’t be separated and that the two were very interrelated.”
For his senior thesis, Duncan took a year off to research the aspirations and opportunities of the urban underclass in Chicago.
“It was an excellent study that revealed a sophisticated understanding of the structural and cultural factors embodied in urban inequality and that have profound implications for individual life chances,” says Wilson of the thesis.
OBAMA’S TEAMMATE
In 2001, Duncan became Chief Executive Officer of Chicago Public Schools, and went on to close failing schools and advocate for performance pay for teachers.
“He’s a realist, and he knows how to get things done,” Webster says of Duncan. “He’s just a problem-solver, and he’s got this very unique skill set to be able to talk to different people and come up with a common solution.”
After assuming office as the Secretary of Education in 2009, Duncan spearheaded the Race to the Top initiative, incentivizing reform in K-12 schools.
Roby says Duncan is “challenging people to think differently about the model of education in this country.” For example, because more mothers work full-time today, Duncan advocates increasing the number of hours in the school day and the number of months in the school year in order to keep children engaged.
Duncan continues get his competitive juices flowing in pickup games at the White House—though with some new teammates, such as President Obama, with whom he played basketball on Election Day.
“I think by the time he’s done he’ll have really moved the needle,” Webster says. “Similar to basketball, he’s spending time at what he loves, and I bet you he doesn’t consider it work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Rage Against the Machine” guitarist Thomas B. Morello ’86 has been arrested for civil disobedience, played in protest concerts of both Republican and Democratic National Conventions, been immortalized as a video game boss in “Guitar Hero III,” and worked as a male stripper to support himself after his college graduation.
Morello, who has made his mark in the music industry with his guitar virtuosity in numerous bands, is also well known for his strong, left-leaning political views—having once described himself as being “the only anarchist in a conservative high school.”
But twenty-five years ago, Morello was still a student concentrating in social studies in Currier House—one who worked hard in school, but practiced guitar even harder.
SETTING THE STAGE
Before he came to Harvard, Morello’s family was enmeshed in anti-establishment politics: Morello’s father was a Mau Mau rebel in Kenya and subsequently became the first United Nations ambassador of Kenya.
Though his mother taught U.S. History in Libertyville, Illinois—where Morello was raised—she later founded an organization to support free speech in music to counter the censorship movement spearheaded by Tipper Gore in the 1990s.
At Harvard, friends say Morello was devoted to both music and academics.
“He practiced every night between 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. with his guitar unamplified, I would say at least six nights a week,” says Ethan C. Anderson ’86, who was Morello’s roommate for three years in Currier House. “He really got twenty hours of practice in every week.”
Morello also played in rock bands as an undergraduate, prior to his mainstream music success.
But while his hard rock-hip-hop fusion with Rage Against the Machine often rails against the government, corporations, and other social structures that perpetuate inequity, his junior year band “Joey Thunder and the Electrical Storm” instead expounded upon more mundane topics. Their songs, often inspired by life at Harvard, included “Library Love” and “Action Man”—a reference to a Cambridge local who had taken to prank calling numbers from the freshman phonebook, claiming he was “looking for some action,” according to Gerald J. Roper ’86, band drummer and friend of Morello’s.
During his time at Harvard, Morello also performed in a number of other bands, including “The Zoo”—named after his six-man suite in Hurlbut freshman year—a band called the “The Deviates” his sophomore year, and “Bored of Education” his senior year.
According to friends, Morello’s musical prowess was a product of his discipline, but other areas of his life sometimes fell by the wayside.
“He could be unbelievably sloppy and incredibly lazy about everything, except for playing guitar and going to class—he never missed class,” Anderson says. “He’d often set his alarm for 1:55 p.m. after [going to bed] late the night before, and he’d always make it to the dining hall in sweats to catch the last five minutes of lunch.”
When not practicing guitar or studying, Morello was also an active intramural athlete.
“I remember our claim to fame was during our senior year, when we won the Co-ed Touch Football House Championship,” says John P. Daley ’86, who lived with Morello for four years.
But as serious as Morello was about his music, he and Anderson had a running joke about the juxtaposition of their musical affiliations on campus. Anderson, who sang in the Din & Tonics a cappella group, remembers coming home late from gigs in his evening coattails and seeing Morello back from his gig as well, wearing spandex and leopard print.
“‘How was your gig?’ ended up being a kind of running joke between us. We really had a good time just making fun of each other,” Anderson says.
RAGING ON
After Harvard, Morello moved to Los Angeles, where he worked, among other jobs, a brief stint as a male stripper.
“I did bachlorette parties and I’d go down to my boxer shorts. Would I go further? All I can say is thank God it was in the time before YouTube!” said Morello in an interview with CHARTattack in 2009. “You could make decent money doing that job—people do what they have to do.”
After forming Rage Against the Machine in 1991, Morello and the rest of the group enjoyed mainstream success, selling over 16 million records to date. Rage Against the Machine eventually broke up in 2000, though the band has periodically reunited since 2007 to play in concerts around the world.
Three of the four members—including Morello—joined forces with the frontman of the now-defunct band Soundgarden to form Audioslave in 2001. Morello also debuted a solo act called “The Nightwatchmen” in 2003 as an outlet for his political views, and most recently, makes up one half of the two-man rap-metal band the Street Sweeper Social Club, which started in 2006.
According to Joseph “Joey Thunder” M. Forbess ’86, one of Morello’s college bandmates, it was clear even in college that Morello had his heart set on making music.
“[After graduation,] I was walking out of Currier with my parents and we saw Tom getting into a van his mother had bought him,” Forbess says. “My mother asked, ‘Hey Tom, where’re you going with that van?’ He replied, ‘I’m going out to California to become a rock star!’ And he did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
According to one of his blockmates, Joel M. Podolny ’86 was one of the first people in his class to use an Apple desktop computer for school.
“At first, I was a little bit envious but then I realized, ‘Hey, maybe I can get on there sometimes and type a paper instead of traipsing down to the science center,’” says James A. Messina ’86, Podolny’s roommate. “That was certainly a treat.”
Nearly 30 years later, Podolny has come full circle, leaving behind a two-decade career in academia—and a deanship at the Yale School of Management—to head Apple University, the company’s internal training program.
Though Apple has not publicly released specific information about the institution, those who know Podolny have attested that his leadership style and management abilities will be appreciated regardless of whether he works in academia or in private industry.
“A JOHN HUGHES MOVIE”
Podolny, who said he was unable to interview for this story due to Apple policy, came to Harvard from a relatively privileged background, according to Messina.
“I came judging him as a little bit of a rich kid when I first met him,” Messina says, noting that Podolny hailed from an affluent Cincinnati neighborhood and was educated at private school, while Messina came from a public school background.
Nonetheless, Messina says that his friendship with Podolny throughout their college careers reminds him of a John Hughes movie—”The Breakfast Club,” in particular.
Messina’s initial impression quickly faded when Podolny joined the Big Brother/Big Sister program and mentored a teenager named Steve, taking him to professional wrestling matches and out for ice cream.
“It was really neat to see that side of Joel, that he had such a big heart,” Messina says.
Though Podolny took part in community service and joined the crew team, Messina says that Podolny also took on a challenging academic load in Social Studies, and his dedication to his coursework left him extremely stressed.
As sophomores in North House—now Pforzheimer House—Messina says that Podolny was beginning to noticeably struggle and seemed to be an “insomniac” for an entire semester. But despite his troubles, Messina says that Podolny’s commanding intellect developed perceptibly throughout their undergraduate years.
“He was not sleeping at all, but still doing amazing work,” Messina says.
Podolny ended up graduating magna cum laude and returned to Harvard the next year to pursue his Ph.D. in sociology.
“INCREDIBLE ADMIRATION”
Cabot House Master Rakesh Khurana, a professor at Harvard Business School, first spoke to Podolny when he was admitted to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where Podolny was serving as a professor of organizational behavior and strategic management at the time. Khurana eventually chose to attend Harvard and later became a professor at HBS in 2000. Podolny also came to Cambridge in 2002 and became Khurana’s colleague, after an 11-year stint at Stanford in which he became an academic dean of the business school. At Harvard, Podolny accepted a joint appointment as a professor of organizational behavior at the Business School and a professor of sociology at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Khurana says he holds “incredible admiration” for Podolny’s work, and considers him a foremost intellectual in his field.
“He was one of the first people to utilize large empirical methods to study the role of social networks to explain economic phenomena,” Khurana says.
Podolny also utilized his expertise in sociology to explain leadership as a field of study, and Khurana says that that Podolny’s personal leadership abilities allowed him to be successful in teaching.
For example, Podolny has a knack for inspiring confidence in his students. As Khurana explains, Podolny would restate his students’ ideas in conversation while hinting at broader concepts, allowing students to pick up on these themes.
“His approach is that he makes people feel smarter than they actually are. He lifts you up and makes you feel like you can do anything in this world,” Khurana says.
His strong leadership was recognized rapidly, and Podolny was named Dean of Yale School of Management at the age of 39. While serving as dean, Podolny instituted extensive reforms to the MBA program curriculum, making it significantly more interdisciplinary. He also expanded the size of the faculty, oversaw in part a 50 percent increase in applications to the school, and helped to raise $170 million in its capital campaign.
However, many who have worked with Podolny attest to his humility and say that his academic success does not change his approach to others.
“While he had a very prolific academic record, he wasn’t impressed by that or wasn’t interested in letting people know just how successful he had been at Stanford,” says Thomas J. DeLong, a professor at Harvard Business School.
APPLE UNIVERSITY
His departure from the school after just three years was unexpected—especially in light of the school’s plans to build a new campus—according to the Yale Daily News.
Though Yale students and academics were surprised that Podolny chose to leave for corporate America, Podolny’s colleagues at Harvard say they were supportive of his decision—though Khurana adds that Podolny’s departure was “academia’s loss.”
David A. Thomas, who served with Podolny on Yale’s Board of Advisers and is currently a professor at HBS, says he feels Podolny made the right decision in leaving Yale when the opportunity at Apple presented itself.
“He left having been very successful. I really can’t say if he had stayed 3 more years, he would have had double the impact,” Thomas says.
Messina, who was in contact with Podolny during this time, says that Podolny’s decision to leave Yale for Apple was “gut-wrenching,” but ultimately motivated by one very specific reason: the opportunity to work with Apple’s then-CEO, Steve Jobs.
“He literally said to me, ‘This is my chance to work with our time’s Thomas Alva Edison,’” Messina says.
Thomas says that Podolny’s time at Apple will train him to be an even more effective leader, should he decide to someday return to academia as a university president or pursue further opportunities in the business world.
“He understands excellence,” Thomas says. “At the end of the day, Joel really can and wants to have a positive impact on society beyond just the boundaries of business or academia.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economist and Princeton professor Cecilia E. Rouse ’86 wanted to become an engineer when she first came to Harvard, but her academic path took a quick turn when she enrolled in the popular freshman course Social Analysis 10, better known as “Ec 10.”
“That was my first introduction to economics, but I was hooked,” says Rouse.
The magna cum laude graduate has since reached the apex of her profession. As a tenured member of the economics faculty at Princeton, she has served on President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers and is one of today’s leading academics on the economics of labor and education.
According to friends, Rouse demonstrated an unfettered curiosity, a compassionate persona, and an extraordinary intellect during her time at the College—and these traits have driven her success throughout her professional career.
A MULTITALENTED WOMAN
Beyond her abilities in economics, Rouse has exercised her intellect in many diverse venues, including music, languages, and social activism.
Rouse, who took French and Farsi courses at the College, also played piano and flute in University orchestras, and helped start wine tasting sessions in Adams House.
“I remember being really impressed with Ceci’s diverse talents,” writes Rouse’s former roommate Carolyn S. Stevens ’86 in an email to The Crimson. “She didn’t fit into that classic Ec major stereotype of someone getting groomed for Wall Street—she was doing so many other things.”
Professors who worked with Rouse echo similar sentiments.
“She had her own ideas at the time and did such different work,” says Claudia Goldin, a professor of economics who was Rouse’s graduate adviser.
For example, Goldin says, Rouse was interested in the economic impact of community colleges—a topic which was “marginalized and sort of pushed aside” at the time, but has become an important research topic today.
Goldin says that Rouse’s passion for music also inspired the pair to embark on a study that examined the role of gender bias in orchestral auditions.
The work was “risky” for Rouse because she was in the early stages in her career, and the research—while time-consuming—was not guaranteed to result in anything useful.
Nonetheless, Rouse pushed forward with her project, and the research eventually appeared as the lead paper in American Economic Review, a top economics journal.
JUGGLING DIFFERENT WORLDS
For Rouse, taking on many diverse roles has always been simply a part of her nature.
Goldin says that while Rouse’s intelligence and determination are obvious, she is also unique in her ability to be a “a friend, a colleague, a mother of two adorable children [and] a person with great appreciation of music and dance and theater.”
Close friends say that Rouse—whose extraordinary time management skills have enabled her to juggle a high profile career with a family—was “self-disciplined” and “very organized” early in her college days.
“When ten o’clock came around, we could be having the most intense conversation, but she would say ‘It’s my bedtime. I have to go to bed,’” says Claire  Finkelstein ’86, who was Rouse’s roommate throughout college.
But in addition to managing her role as an academic economist, public policy expert, and adviser to the President, Rouse has also found the time to be an extremely loyal friend.
“She is ... the sort of person you know you will be able to count on for the rest of your life,” Finkelstein says.
For Rouse, being able to balance relationships and a prominent career has required her to retain an organized and determined approach to life.
“I’ve definitely had to make choices and prioritize [to] be the wife and mom that I want to be and continue to be the economist that I want to be as well,” she says.
ADVOCATING FOR SOCIAL CHANGE
The focus of Rouse’s academic endeavors—the economics of labor and education—sheds light on another facet of her personality: her devotion to social advocacy.
In fact, her first interest in economics stemmed from a desire to understand the consequences of the recession in the early 1980s.
“I’ve always been concerned about social issues, and I was struck by high unemployment,” she says.
Rouse’s sister Carolyn, who is also a Princeton professor, says that her sister’s desire to effect social change was obvious even when they were growing up.
“She has always been very outspoken,” Carolyn says. “Early on in her life, she wanted to be able to change social systems from within.”
Harvard economics graduate student Emily G. Sands, who was one of Rouse’s undergraduate thesis advisees, says that Rouse was “extremely dedicated to the project and to student life,” and remained connected even when she was away from campus working for the Obama Administration.
“To go into Washington, she was willing to move her family and make a lot of sacrifices in order to give back to the country,” Sands says.
Rouse’s classmates agree that she also  pursued extracurriculars as an undergraduate with a desire to give back to the community—sometimes in unorthodox ways.
Amada R. Sandoval ’87, who was also Rouse’s roommate, says that Rouse initiated wine tasting events at Adams House with the hope of educating her fellow students.
“In a way, she felt it was a public service of sorts,” Sandoval says, adding that Rouse hoped to show others that good wine did not have to be extremely expensive.
When asked if her appointment to the Obama administration was expected, Rouse’s former roommates respond with enthusiasm.
“Ceci was cut out for great things,” writes Stevens. “She went about her studies like a true professional: purposeful and balanced—no surprises there!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In early September 1985, student editors of the CUE Guide—the Committee of Undergraduate Education’s yearly student review of professors and teaching fellows—voiced concerns about administrative censorship in that year’s guide. In a preface to the guide, the editors contended that a Harvard official had pressured them to make revisions to criticisms of several instructors, such as the deletion of words such as “arrogant” and “condescending.”
Barbara S. Okun ’86, Editor-in-Chief of the CUE Guide at the time, stated that Dean K. Whitla, director of the Office of Instructional Research and Evaluation, had looked over the write-ups in mid-July of that year and objected to the “harsh tone” of several reviews. He allegedly stated that the staff of the CUE guide would have to “pack their bags” unless changes—which he referred to as “suggestions”—were made. Okun added that Whitla threatened to cancel the publication of the book if his demands were not met.
Okun said in a 1985 interview with the Crimson that 17 of 250 write-ups in the guide were altered in some way, including descriptions of professors such as Stephen J. Gould, Brendan A. Maher, Lewis H. Lockwood, and Bernard Bailyn.
For example, in a review of Bailyn’s Core course Historical Studies B-31: “The Revolutionary Transformation of America,” the original statement “one-fourth of respondents ... find him arrogant or condescending” was changed to “find him somewhat distant and firm in his opinions.”
These types of alterations “fail to convey the intensity of the criticism” and “sometimes misrepresent the nature” of the anonymous evaluations, the editors said. They argued that these types of changes were “undermining” the CUE Guide’s “integrity and objectivity.”
Okun still recalls the strong feelings associated with what she and the CUE editing staff felt was censorship.
“We had worked hard to try and accurately reflect what students had to say about their lecturers, reading through hundreds and hundreds of student questionnaires, and we did not want our work to be compromised by what was clear arm-twisting,” Okun wrote in an email to The Crimson last week.
Steven E. Ozment, former associate dean for undergraduate education and the CUE’s faculty advisor, said of the alleged censorship in an interview in 1985, “If it walks like a duck and acts like a duck, I guess it’s a duck.”
As a result of criticism by the student editors, then-Dean of the Faculty A. Michael Spence said that he and other officials were mistaken in asking student editors to alter the negative criticisms of professors. “It was our fault,” he said in an interview in 1985.
Following the incident, the Faculty Council was scheduled to convene to discuss what policies should be implemented to prevent such problems in the future.
THE PLOT THICKENS
As the controversy over the alleged censorship became widely known on campus, issues of imprecise policy concerning editorial review by administrators and student editors were brought to light. The question of editorial control was complicated by the fact that the University provided the $65,000 of funding for the project, while the students worked to process, organize, and produce the content.
There was some precedent for administrative intervention: in 1976, the Faculty Council had discussed the Guide four times, and made several important rulings that affected the format of the Guide, including the stipulations that students could not include grade distributions of the course in their reviews, and that one of the questions from the course survey be removed (“How well organized is the instructor’s speaking style?”).
But Okun said the de facto policy at the time of the controversy appeared to favor placing editorial freedom in hands of student editors.
“I always thought that [the CUE Guide] was editorially independent. That’s the assumption that we’ve worked on over the past couple of years,” Okun said in a 1985 interview. “I think it should be editorially free.”
Students on the Undergraduate Council also voiced their concerns about the alleged censorship.
“I can’t see how they could conscientiously avoid consulting the Undergraduate Council,” said Brian R. Melendez ’86, the council’s outgoing chairman, in a 1985 interview. “For them to go ahead and take action would not only be an affront to the undergraduate community, but also hypocritical.”
“I’d be very concerned if they didn’t consult us,” said Brian C. Offutt ’87, chairman of the UC’s Academics Committee in October 1985.
CHANGING CONSENSUS
While the student editors of the guide and concerned student representatives awaited the results of the Faculty Council’s deliberations on editorial policy for the CUE Guide, Whitla released a letter that charged the student editors with “a failure to be honest.”
“I did not, as stated, threaten people’s summer jobs, nor suggest that this guide would not be published,” Whitla wrote. “I did not have the authority to halt publication nor did I, at any point, presume to have that authority.”
While Whitla’s remarks complicated the original account given by Okun and the other editors, the process of revising CUE Guide editorial policy continued.
By late October, members of the student-faculty committee established to evaluate the CUE Guide’s policies rallied unanimously around a proposal by Professor of Biology Robert M. Woollacott, which suggested that the Undergraduate Council assume responsibility for the book.
By doing so, the book’s editorial autonomy and credibility would be protected while its official legitimacy would be removed, thus addressing previous concerns that the guide would be misused by departments to judge their teaching fellows and tenure candidates, said David S. Hilzenrath ’87 in an opinion piece in The Crimson at the time.
An abrupt reversal of opinion emerged several weeks later in November when the faculty members of the committee voiced their support for continued faculty and administrative oversight of the CUE.
Ozment said that it was “extremely likely” that the faculty would not fund the CUE if they had no control over the book.
By December, a decision was reached that student editors should determine the book’s contents but not its editorial policy, and this agreement finally yielded the autonomy that students had desired, while maintaining the authority of the faculty in policy decisions.
Faculty Secretary John R. Marquand said that members of the Faculty Council “felt it important that the guide have general credibility with students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although numerous suites in Mather House continue to share adjoining bathrooms, Lorelee S. Stewart ’86 recalls an instance in which the dorm room design was deemed unacceptable: a room of straight male students refused to use the same facilities as their gay neighbors for fear of being exposed to AIDS.
“We were at Harvard, where people are very smart and are some of the brightest students in the United States,” she says. “I was very surprised that this was how people were behaving.”
Such tensions played out at both the local and national level as AIDS began to dominate the media and arouse public concern. While Massachusetts Governor Michael S. Dukakis  approved a policy effectively prohibiting gays and lesbians from acting as foster parents, the U.S. Surgeon General asked the public to engage in frank and open discussions about the disease.
However, an incomplete understanding of AIDS transmission also polarized a fearful University and subjected both students and faculty to the consequences of stigmatization.
SUSPICION AND SICKNESS
According to Stewart, AIDS became a public health concern at a time when the societal climate was still hesitant to accept the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian students. Stewart, who was an open lesbian, served as a co-chair of the Gay and Lesbian Students Association, and recalls that the organization’s sign was torn down by another student during an event.
“That [episode] gives you an idea of what it was like to be out at that point in time,” Stewart says. “It wasn’t comfortable. It could be a complete nightmare.”
Christiana H. Logansmith ’87—a former member of the naval ROTC—says that while she stands by a letter she wrote to The Crimson in 1986 defending the military’s policy of excluding students with the AIDS virus, the conversations she overheard as an undergraduate suggested the pervasiveness of homophobia on campus.
“I remember hearing discussions between male students,” she says. “One of them, who was a fundamentalist Christian, was not happy about having a gay roommate. He had a walk-through and he didn’t like that because he wasn’t sure what he was exposing himself to as he came in and out of the room.”
Although a growing body of medical research indicated that AIDS could not be spread through casual contact, misconceptions about the disease remained widespread. Gay and lesbian students, in addition to those who showed an interest in AIDS research and advocacy, were targeted.
Jonathan H. Mermin ’87-’88 took a year off to participate in a research group analyzing the policy ramifications of the burgeoning disease. This work was met with skepticism by his peers, he says.
“I remember people asking me why I was working with HIV and having at least one roommate who was embarrassed about my research,” Mermin says. “There were still so many questions about whether AIDS was caused from an infectious agent or whether it was caused by something else.”
Mermin said that many people who were HIV positive were forced to deal with discrimination and stigmatization while also trying to cope with the realities of the disease.
“People were fearful about not knowing everything,” Stewart says. “A lot of people worried that [researchers] would discover something else about AIDS later on. No one wanted to take any chances.”
MEDICINE AND MISTREATMENT
Even before the AIDS crisis reached a fever pitch in the mid-1980s, researchers began to notice the increased frequency of the new and mysterious infection.
At the time, only the Center for Disease Control outranked Harvard in the number of scientists involved in AIDS research.
Harvard School of Public Health Professor Myron E. Essex first became involved in AIDS research after the CDC noted the disease’s growing prevalence.
Essex says that many research teams drew from their areas of expertise to explore the pathology of the virus.
“A lot of discussion was about what the cause might be and ... different groups starting to work on different hypotheses,” Essex says.
Drawing from his background in virology, Essex’s team theorized that the disease was rooted in infected T4 blood cells.
Meanwhile, Harvard Medical School Professor Martin S. Hirsch began researching the development and spread of HIV in 1981.
“I would say that our biggest contribution in the field was developing therapies and particularly the concept of combination therapies of HIV infection,” Hirsch says.
Medical School Professor Jerome E. Groopman says he remembers that period vividly.
“[We] were very committed in terms of AIDS,” he says, adding that researchers were concerned not only with the physiological effects of AIDS, but also the “discrimination, stigmatization, and profound misunderstanding of the disease.”
Even for researchers at the Medical School and School of Public Health, the anxiety stemming from the unknown was nearly palpable.
“There was fear—and an understandable fear—that one was dealing with a virus and nobody was quite sure what the virus was,” Hirsch recalls.
And even among the medical community, prejudice was a factor.
“There were physicians who didn’t want to see the patients or operate on the patients,” Hirsch says. “And they didn’t want laboratories next to their own laboratories that were doing research on AIDS.”
Groopman says that a homophobic culture and unfounded fears about potential contamination contributed to wariness within the medical community about treating AIDS patients.
“There were a lot of institutions that really didn’t want to care for these patients,” Groopman says.
In addition to the stigma attached to being gay, and uncertainty about the pathology of AIDS, Essex says that an early source of trepidation was the mystery of how the disease was transmitted.
“Not knowing at the time that it would be only sexually transmitted—as opposed to aerosol—generated a lot more fear [and enhanced] the discrimination that was then going on against the gay community,” Essex says.
According to Groopman, few in the medical community were willing to take a proactive stance in combatting AIDS.
“It required the personal commitment, both for laboratory scientists as well as clinicians including myself and Martin Hirsch, who said, ‘Yes, these are people who are very ill and suffering. We have limited treatments but we’re committed to helping them, and then we’re going to embark on a real effort to figure out what causes the disease and how to potentially limit it,’” Groopman says.
LOOK HOW FAR WE’VE COME
AIDS researchers and former Harvard students say there have been tremendous strides in both AIDS treatment and tempering the social stigma attached to the disease.
“The biggest difference between now and then is that AIDS was new ... and it was a death sentence. People who caught it died quickly,” Logansmith says.
Peter D. Gadol ’86, who helped organize an arts benefit for AIDS research as an undergraduate, adds that the current environment for gay and bisexual students is much more welcoming than the one that he encountered as a student.
“It’s not the same world. It’s interesting how, in many ways, the coming-out experience, which is very powerful to gay people, remains a vital moment,” he says. “There’s no doubt that the world is a different place than it was 25 years ago.”
However, according to Mermin, this is not a reason to underplay the consequences of the disease.
“There is almost a sense of complacency in the American public,” he says. “Twenty years ago there was more fear and stigma than the disease deserved, but now we have too few resources than are necessary to make a maximum difference.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Administrative Board—the primary disciplinary body of Harvard College—came under fire in 1986 after the Board handed down punishments in two separate cases that were perceived by students as unduly harsh given the nature of the offenses.
Students also criticized the Ad Board and its processes as unjust, out of touch, and secretive—complaints that persist among students 25 years later.
“THIS COMPUTER TEST SUCKS”
In April 1986, eight freshmen hacked into University computer systems during a Quantitative Reasoning Requirement—a mandatory test for freshmen at the time—causing the computers to repeatedly print the phrase, “This computer test sucks.”
In response, the Ad Board initially decided to punish all of the pranksters—with the exception of H. Glen Abel ’89, who turned in his conspirators—with a one-year withdrawal from the College.
The disciplinary response to the widely publicized incident drew ire from students, many of whom felt the consequences were excessive.
“I was angry,” says Eddy J. Rogers III ’89, one of the convicted students. “I thought it was a very heavy punishment and inappropriate for what had happened—something that was just a stupid prank.”
Roughly 90 Weld North tenants expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict in a letter to then-Dean of the College and Chair of the Ad Board L. Fred Jewett ’57. Among them was Mihail S. Lari ’89, who says he was surprised and angered that students were unable to represent themselves in the process.
“The Ad Board seemed to be a remnant from the past, where faculty members had all the power, and students had little say in their own defense or seeing any change in the process that resulted in harsh punishment that sometimes didn’t fit the infraction,” Lari says.
While the Ad Board overturned its original decision a week later—after the seven convicted freshmen appeared in person to appeal their verdicts—the students were all placed on disciplinary probation, and in some cases restricted from participating in extracurricular activities.
Rogers and Gregory P. Gicewicz ’89—both football players—were forced to withdraw from the team, and Marcus Q. Mitchell ’89 was ordered by the Ad Board to resign from the Undergraduate Council after he was initially elected in the semester following the prank.
“We deserved some punishment, but not that,” Rogers says of the second punishment, adding that he feels the reduced ruling was still too harsh for the nature of the offense.
FIRE IN MCKINLOCK
This was not the first time in 1986 in which the Ad Board was criticized for its rulings. In a less-publicized case in February, two Leverett students accidentally started a small fire in McKinlock Hall’s B-entryway as a result of a series of escalating pranks with their friends.
The Ad Board asked the two students to withdraw for a year, while three other students participating in the pranks were put on disciplinary probation.
Their blockmate, Michael L. Goldenberg ’88, wrote a letter to The Crimson protesting the outcome of the case.
“The incident occurred amidst an atmosphere of joking and playfulness. Intentions on all sides were purely benign. The fire was an accident. And although it was potentially very dangerous, nobody was hurt and there was no substantial property damage,” he wrote. Goldenberg also spoke strongly against the lack of student representation on the Board.
“A student writes a statement of his involvement to be read at the hearing, and from there, can only cross his fingers and pray,” he wrote. “He cannot even appear at the hearing in order to ensure that his case is properly argued and that all of the facts are understood.”
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who served as a representative for the two students to the Ad Board, declined to comment on the incident.
“OUT OF TOUCH”
In addition to the perceived injustice of the disciplinary measures, the Ad Board was criticized for being secretive and out of touch with the student body.
“I thought [the incident] brought the whole system of disciplinary action at Harvard under the spotlight as an archaic process,” says Rogers. “Back then, they were just completely out of touch with reality.”
Rogers cites a later incident in which he was questioned by a member of the Ad Board about a roommate’s activities.
“One of the questions I was asked was, ‘How many people were at the party?’ and I said, ‘I don’t know,’ and the guy said, ‘Well, how many invitations did you send out?’” Rogers recalls. “I wanted to ask him, ‘Do you even know how college works?’”
Julie L. Belcove ’89, a former Crimson editor who reported on the computer prank in 1986, characterizes the Ad Board at the time as “very draconian.”
“Any time something is behind closed doors, it’s suspicious,” she adds.
John “Jay” L. Ellison, the current secretary of the Ad Board, says that the Board has undergone reforms since 1986 that have addressed some of the previous criticisms. For example, students are now able to choose a faculty member other than their resident dean as an advisor and representative, eliminating the dual role that the resident dean used to play as both a student advocate and a Board member.
“Having more openness about our process and sitting down with every student does help it be more transparent,” he says, adding that the Ad Board goes under review every couple of years.
“I’m glad to see that the Ad Board is being revamped,” says Lari. “But [I] wonder if the changes are going as far as they should.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the personal computers available in 1986 were roughly 300 times slower than today’s laptops, they began what would become a technological revolution on Harvard’s campus.
The University first started selling personal computers—including the first-generation Macintosh 128K and the IBM PC/XT—at heavily discounted prices in 1984.
In spite of the wide array of available options, the user-friendly Macintosh—which is often credited with popularizing the modern-day graphical user interface, as well as the use of the computer mouse—became the most widely-used personal computer on campus, according to Computer Science Professor and former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68.
“It was miserably slow and clumsy, but ... the interface was enticing,” says Lewis, who says he was the first person to own a Macintosh on campus.
CHANGING COMPUTER SCIENCE
In 1985, Lewis decided to teach his course Computer Science 11: “Computers, Algorithms, and Programs” using personal Macintosh computers instead of the older IBM computers, which required students to do their work by means of a mainframe system in the Science Center.
“Harry had the vision that [personal computers were] something that you could actually teach a course on,” says Edward “Ted” D. Nesson ’83, who served as Lewis’s head teaching fellow for CS 11 in the late 1980s. “His vision was a little ahead of its time.”
The Macintosh computers that students used had 128KB of RAM memory, which amounts to roughly .003 percent of the memory available in a Macbook Pro today. The older Mac’s limited memory made it difficult to use, and students had to keep all of their information on floppy disks.
Nevertheless, the novel operating systems of the Macintosh computers, which allowed users to click on icons rather than typing in commands, brought a new element to CS 11.
“You had to beat your way through these esoteric incantations to do things on other computers,” says Penny Rheingans ’85, another CS 11 TF, in reference to the command-line interface of older computers. “[In Macs], there was a ‘magic incantation’ level, but there was also a level where you can use things without having to know these commands. The barrier to entry was much lower for the Mac than it was for other computers at that time.”
The advent of more user-friendly personal computers also increased their appeal to the lay student, who had previously relied primarily on typewriters, Nesson says.
In fact, by 1986, computers had become a coveted academic tool on campus.
“Initially, you didn’t need one if you weren’t in CS. Gradually, though, people bought them for word processing. The fact that you could type something and have it printed out was revolutionary,” he says.
CONNECTING THE CAMPUS
The University faced a challenge in enabling different computers to interact with one another.
Administrators were able to email each other, but the faculty pushed to create a campus-wide network, which was implemented—to a limited extent—in July of 1985.
“The idea was to tie up Sever, University Hall, and the Science Center using a cable system,” says Professor of Pure and Applied Physics and former Dean of the Division of Applied Science Paul C. Martin ’52. “At the time, there was only a cable system that connected the Unix fax machines on campus.”
As personal computer use became more widespread, the University was also able to improve its technological resources.
“Harvard bought about 300 new, faster machines, so students were able to come to the technology center and not have to wait for hours to use a computer,” says Rheingans.
Harvard’s transition into a more technologically advanced age sparked a gradual change in the computing world both on and off campus.
“CS went from being a field made up of a bunch of geeks to a field where we began to see a broader mix. We saw more women in the field who were every bit as qualified as the men,” says Nesson. “It’s a field where if you were good, you could get a good job.”
Looking back on 1986, Martin recalls how his Applied Sciences committee first pondered if and how computers could be used on campus.
“I think that question has largely been answered,” he says. “Computers have become such an integral part of our lives.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 5 a.m. on the first icy winter days of 1986, Iris M. Mack used to exercise.
On some mornings, the fifth-year graduate student at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences jogged by the frozen Charles River. On others, she went to the gym to lift weights with two male friends.
“I was crazy,” she recalls of those freezing early mornings. “But back then I was in tip-top shape.”
Mack was training in pursuit of a dream—a spot in the NASA space shuttle mission specialist program, which she planned to apply to upon receiving her Ph.D. in applied math that spring.
Encouraged by her mentor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology-educated astronaut Ronald McNair—who was then preparing to go into space onboard the 1986 Challenger space shuttle expedition—Mack signed up for flying lessons and continued her rigorous workout routine.
She was heading out for a daytime run on Tuesday, January 28 when she heard the news.
The Challenger—with McNair, high school teacher Christa McAuliffe, and five other astronauts onboard—had exploded 73 seconds into its flight.
As news of the tragedy spread across Harvard’s campus, the disaster set into motion emotional, professional, and institutional changes in how students and researchers viewed the space program.
A CAMPUS CONFUSED
Tracy E. Velazquez ’86 was walking into the Mather House tower when she found out about the disaster.
John P. Dennis III ’86 was interviewing in Washington, D.C. for a post-graduation career in the Navy when the news broke.
Wade E. Roush ’89 was in the Science Center doing a programming assignment when a student announced what had happened. Roush ran across the Yard back to Straus Hall and spent the rest of the day glued to the television, watching coverage of the disaster.
In Leverett House, Joseph F. McCafferty Jr. ’86 and his roommates gathered in their dorm room to watch replays “over and over.” McCafferty recalls that many students did not attend their afternoon classes.
“Campus life kind of slowed, if not stopped,” says Velazquez. “You went back from where you were when you heard about it and watched television.”
The tone on campus was “quite subdued and somber,” says Christopher S. Yoo ’86.
According to Darren A. Thierry ’86, the black community at Harvard was particularly affected by the death of Mack’s mentor McNair, who was African-American.
As a member of Kappa Alpha Psi—a historically black fraternity chartered at MIT—during his time at Harvard, Thierry recalls that McNair had been a member of another MIT fraternity, Omega Psi Phi.
“I just remember talking to friends, saying, ‘Hey, there was a brother on that flight,’” Thierry remembers.
Likewise, many in the scientific community at Harvard mourned the loss of the astronauts.
Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan C. McDowell says that he and his colleagues identified with the astronauts who had been killed on the flight.
“For those of us who were following it, they were not just faceless astronauts,” he says. “They were people we knew a little about.”
But after the immediate shock had subdued, some College students began making “tasteless” jokes about the disaster, recalls Michael J. Youmans ’86.
The Crimson’s weekly magazine published a feature that questioned whether it was too soon to make light of the disaster. The piece received widespread criticism for its inclusion of many jokes.
“I remember it being an attempt at humor at a time of national tragedy. People turn to humor. It wasn’t a very proud moment,” says Ari Z. Posner ’86.
DREAMS DEFERRED
Although most students worked through their grief over the tragedy in the subsequent weeks, others experienced lasting changes in their career aspirations.
As the NASA shuttle program entered a 32-month hiatus in the wake of the explosion, Mack’s plans to enter the space program were instantly halted.
“I would have sent my application in right away,” she says. “But I didn’t apply because there was nothing to apply to.”
Mack recalls feeling a sense of sadness at the delay of her goal.
“Now I’ve seen real problems,” Mack says. “But at the time, I was disappointed because it threw off my big plan.”
Upon receiving her Ph.D. four months later, Mack instead left Harvard to take a teaching position at MIT.
Two years later, when the shuttle program was revived, Mack was finally able to pursue her dream. She applied to the shuttle program, making it to the semifinalist round of interviews.
Roush also changed his career path in response to the Challenger disaster.
As a dual concentrator in physics and astronomy who had been “fantasizing about being an astronaut,” Roush says he became disillusioned with his studies after the disaster.
He began to critically analyze the risks of the space program and what he saw as the “bureaucracy” of NASA, which he and others thought may have failed to prevent the explosion.
“I had a pretty romantic notion before going to college,” he says. “Seeing how so much can ride on a program like the space shuttle helped to open my eyes.”
Roush changed his concentration to history and science and later wrote his Ph.D. thesis on technological disasters. He now works as a technology journalist.
Even students who did not change their career plans say that the disaster forever changed the spirit of their generation.
For undergraduates at the College, most of whom were not even born at the time of the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Challenger disaster was their first experience of a national tragedy.
“We were a sheltered generation in terms of American history,” Velazquez says.
The disaster also awakened students to the dangers of the shuttle program, which, in the years preceding the tragedy, had been envisioned as a future form of commercial transportation.
Christa McAuliffe, who boarded the Challenger as the first schoolteacher hoping to travel to space, represented the beginning of the fulfillment of that promise.
“It was practically like riding a bus,” recalls Paul F. Vittimberga ’86 of the pre-Challenger notion of shuttle flight. “[The disaster] kind of pulled back on the dream of the shuttle. It wasn’t exactly a bus ride to space,” he says.
“There was a sense that the space program would never be the same,” Yoo adds.
RESEARCH REVERSED
While the Challenger disaster jeopardized the abstract dreams of a generation of aspiring astronauts, the tragedy also had tangible effects on the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), where professionals and academics were studying, researching, and developing projects for the space program.
Located at 60 Garden St., the CfA was officially created in 1973 and combined projects under the Harvard College Observatory and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Center.
The CfA had a direct connection with the Challenger, having designed an infrared telescope aboard the shuttle’s previous 1985 mission.
McDowell says that the disaster caused developmental and financial setbacks at the CfA, where he began working as an astrophysicist in 1987.
“We were making a big slow turn in one direction, and we had to make a screeching U-turn,” McDowell says. “We lost a good part of a decade in space exploration as a result of this.”
For example, the hiatus of the shuttle program delayed several satellite projects at the CfA.
Before the disaster, many scientists believed that all future projects were going to fly into space aboard shuttles, which were then seen as the most dependable vehicle to carry complicated and expensive payloads, according to Harvey D. Tananbaum—a senior astrophysicist and director of the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center.
After spending years and millions of dollars developing satellites that would be safe alongside astronauts for shuttle launches, researchers now had to temporarily redesign satellites to be compatible with rocket launch.
“We were all very eager to have this go, so that was a big deal when [the program] stopped,” says Astronomy Professor Robert P. Kirshner ’70, who had designed a satellite that was intended to be launched aboard a shuttle.
Given its supposed reliability, the shuttle had also once been envisioned as a way to allow scientists to perform their own experiments in space.
But Martin Elvis, a senior astrophysicist at the CfA, says that the death of six astronauts and a civilian aboard a shuttle made that hope unrealistic.
“No way we were going to be flying to space with our own experiments after this, which was the fantasy originally,” Elvis says.
During the shuttle program hiatus, researchers at the CfA did not halt their research entirely, but they were forced to work entirely with old data, according to McDowell.
“There was plenty of work to do, but people lost direction a little bit,” says Roush, who had secured work-study employment at the CfA before he changed his academic path.
Irwin I. Shapiro, the director of the CfA from 1983 to 2004, says he does not recall a serious detrimental impact on the observatory, but says the disaster  caused a number of short term difficulties for the space program.
For example, the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope was delayed in response to the Challenger, which in turn delayed the launch of the CfA’s Chandra telescope—described as an X-ray version of the Hubble.
Although the CfA had begun work on Chandra in the 1980s, they did not receive a contract to develop it until 1991, two years after the return of the shuttle program. The telescope was finally launched in 1999.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the blacks in apartheid South Africa were living in shantytowns in the heart of Johannesburg, Harvard College student activists were living in ones they had constructed in the middle of the Yard.
On an April night in 1986, more than 200 South Africa divestment activists erected a shantytown and a symbolic 16-foot ivory tower in front of University Hall to protest Harvard’s investment in companies doing business in South Africa.
Led by the Southern Africa Solidarity Committee (SASC), student activists also staged sit-ins outside University Hall offices and organized multiple protests—including one that attracted over 5,000 people. The movement drew attention not only from Harvard administrators, but also from those outside of the Harvard bubble.
HARVARD’S INVESTMENTS
In the late 1970s, many American corporations, universities, and state governments began the process of divesting from South African companies in order to place financial pressure on the apartheid government through economic isolation.
The University, however, remained reluctant to pull out from its investments, and administrators publicly stated that they could better advocate for civil rights for South African blacks by staying involved in the country.
“The most obvious result of divestment would be that the university would lose the influence it currently has to try to persuade companies to oppose apartheid and improve the lot of their Black employees,” wrote then-University President Derek C. Bok in a 1986 open letter to the community.
In response to student protests, Harvard also established a South Africa aid program, which provided a $1 million fund to benefit victims of apartheid and created the South Africa Internship Program, which sent Harvard undergraduates to South Africa for a year to work in educational institutions that help black South Africans.
“THE RIGHT THING”
By 1986, the University was no stranger to the movement to divest from South Africa. Protests began as early as the 1970s, led by the Black Students Association and the SASC, though the movement eventually lost steam, says Damon A. Silvers ’86.
The 1980s saw a revival of the initiative on campus, spurred by growing political repression in South Africa and the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 to South African Archbishop and prominent civil rights activist Desmond M. Tutu, who was a strong advocate for divestment.
Harvard’s continuing resistance to divestment drew widespread criticism from the University community, especially amongst students.
With the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 60s still fresh in Americans’ minds, many students saw the University’s failure to take a strong position against the South African government as immoral.
“There was an undertone here that this was about what kind of country the U.S. was going to be,” Silvers says. “In theory, the U.S. had turned its back on institutionalized racism. But there was a bunch of ways in which we were propping it up.”
“It struck me as deeply dishonest for us not to join the movement to isolate the apartheid regime,” says Jamin B. Raskin ’83, pointing to the fact that the South African government was not only imprisoning politicians but killing people by the thousands.
Students also criticized the 1986 South Africa aid program, especially the internship component, saying that the affiliated work sites—including five primarily white private schools—were not particularly relevant to the South African black community.
“Black South Africans ... have all mentioned in their comments on the Internship Program that they see the program as a way of avoiding divestment and other sanctions against South Africa,” read a report from the SASC condemning the program.
“The choice [for the University] was whether to maintain institutional complicity with the apartheid government or to join this international movement to bring change to South Africa,” Raskin says. “It was an intense political experience because we all loved Harvard very much, and we wanted Harvard to do the right thing.”
“A LIVING PROTEST”
Beginning in the 1984-85 academic year, the University saw a period punctuated by numerous student protests in support of divestment.
For example, the SASC invited Reverend Jesse L. Jackson to speak at a rally in 1985 that filled the Yard with over 5,000 activists.
Student protestors also organized a chaotic blockade of South African Consul-General Abe S. Hoppenstein when he came to speak at Lowell House, established collection drives for African causes, and staged multiple sit-ins at the offices of top University administrators, including Bok and members of the Harvard Corporation.
“We just walked in and sat down and said we were not going to leave the building,” says Rebecca K. Kramnick ’87, who covered the sit-in of the site of a Corporation meeting for The Crimson.
The students were snacking and singing, and it was a “jolly atmosphere,” Kramnick says.
“You gotta get rid of apartheid or a bunch of kids are going to be climbing up on [your] desk and smoking [your] cigars,” jokes Michael T. Anderson ’83 about the message the protestors were sending to University leaders.
And on a spring night in April 1986, members of the SASC constructed their own shantytown—consisting of seven shanties as well as the colossal ivory tower—in front of University Hall.
The settlement—which Silvers says drew “constant student presence”—was meant to represent Harvard’s indifference to the plight of South African blacks, according to Kramnick.
“People were living there and it was a living protest,” Kramnick says.
A few days later, the Conservative Club built a “Black Tower” and a “gulag” in opposition to University investments in Soviet Union-related companies.
The effects of the shantytown protest spread beyond just students.
Duncan M. Kennedy ’64, a Harvard Law school professor at the time, recalls that several faculty members—including Kennedy himself—organized classes in the shantytown among the encamped students.
According to Kennedy, fifteen or sixteen of the twenty students in his class attended the lecture in the shantytown—”higher than normal attendance,” Kennedy says.
“[The protests] gave [faculty] a sense that the students we spent our time teaching had a real moral core and in some ways were more committed than our colleagues,” Kennedy says.
LASTING EFFECTS
The constant pressure on the University ultimately resulted in partial divestment from South Africa, as well as the cancellation of the internship program.
“In the past, there have been attempts at divestment that were inappropriately swayed by particular points of view on campus where the students were manipulated,” says South African native Nicolette D. Mayer ’88, citing Saudi Arabia and Israel as modern examples. “[But] in the case of South Africa, something fantastic was achieved.”
Kramnick says that although the partial divestment was largely a result of alumni criticism—rather than student activism—the student movement played an important role in raising awareness of the issue.
And while the shantytown was eventually taken down, and rallies faded away, the movement for South African divestment had a lasting influence on the lives of many involved.
According to Raskin, some of the undergraduates involved in the rallies continued to advocate for civil rights in their careers.
For example, Raskin—a state Senator in Maryland—notes that he and other politicians discussed the apartheid protest movement as part of their political campaigns.
“The experience of the divestment movement taught us all a lot of political skills,” he says. “We learned how to organize events and we learned how to debate and to write for a political purpose, so it propelled a number of my friends into careers in law and public life.”
Anderson says the experience gave students a taste of the power of activism.
“The exhilarating part of the movement was feeling like we were engaged in a chess game with the administration,” says Anderson. “It gave everybody that was involved some kind of idea that these institutions are not all powerful—that they can be pushed and even provoked.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1985, a Harvard informant came forward to The Crimson and hand-delivered a package of documents that had never before been made available to the public.
The package contained extensive information about the Central Intelligence Agency’s dealings with Nadav Safran, then-director of Harvard’s Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
The informant was disturbed by Safran’s financial ties to the CIA, which included a transfer of more than $150,000 to fund the publishing of Safran’s book as well as funds for Safran to organize a conference involving distinguished Middle Eastern scholars and diplomats from around the world.
The controversy came nine years after Harvard—in response to a Congressional investigation into CIA funding of research—had reformed its policies by requiring professors to disclose CIA grants to the University.
As a result, Safran found himself answering to Harvard, the media, and the participants of his conference, many of whom decided not to attend after finding out that it was funded in part by an American intelligence agency.
Twenty-five years later, the ethical questions raised by the Safran controversy continue to define and shape the way Harvard approaches research sponsorship.
WIKILEAKS OF 1986
Michael W. Hirschorn ’86, the Crimson reporter who took the lead in breaking this story, says it was essentially the “Wikileaks” of its time and that, as the scandal erupted, there were calls for the arrest of the Crimson editors.
“It was hugely controversial at the time, to the point that the novelist Mark Helprin, a regular columnist for the Wall Street Journal, wrote a huge full-page [editorial] saying we should go to jail and that we had violated university policy, that we were criminals,” Hirschorn says.
Nevertheless, Hirschorn, who is now a television producer, says he did not hesitate to cover the story because he was concerned about the lack of University transparency at the time.
It was later revealed that Safran had informed former Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky, as well as the book’s publisher, Harvard University Press, of his funding sources.
However, Rosovsky failed to review the terms of the contract and did not adequately respond to Safran’s disclosure.
In the aftermath of the scandal, Safran kept his tenured position at Harvard, but stepped down as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
Hirschorn says the central problem lay in the fact that Safran’s research was likely compromised, as well as the fact that the CIA had access to Safran’s connections.
According to Hirschorn, the CIA’s contract with Safran stipulated that its involvement would not be disclosed, in addition to having the right to prior review and censorship.
Hirschorn says that The Crimson received previous versions of Safran’s book, which contained sections that had been redacted and never released to the public.
In addition, he says that Safran had been a major figure in the Middle East and had personal relationships with many public figures in the region.
“He had access to the top levels of all those governments, and was essentially in the secret pay of the CIA at the time,” Hirschorn says. “If you’re an Egyptian foreign minister attending this [conference], you would presumably be attending under the assumption that this was an academic gathering and a safe place to discuss things, as opposed to an extension of the CIA.”
Upon learning of the conference’s funding source, half of the participants refrained from attending. One even flew directly back to Cairo after landing in Boston and learning of Safran’s dealings.
A CLIMATE OF DISTRUST
Safran’s interactions with the CIA were significant in helping to develop the University’s policies towards proper conduct when accepting government funds.
But he was not the only professor whose dealings with the CIA would become controversial.
In 1986, two Harvard-affiliated professors, Samuel P. Huntington and Richard K. Betts ’69, were criticized after it was discovered that an article they had published in the Harvard journal “International Security” was based on research funded by the CIA—but did not mention the CIA as a funding source.
The report on instability following the death of third-world dictators was entirely unclassified, according to Betts, who was an independent consultant to the intelligence community at the time.
Nevertheless, the CIA requested that its name be kept off the publication so that the views expressed in the research would not be connected to the American government—a national security concern that Betts says he considers entirely justified.
“More frank work can be done if the government is not associated with the analysis,” Betts explains.
Controversy arose when the CIA connection was discovered, and the academic community found fault with Betts and Huntington for concealing the source of funding.
Betts says that he was very clear with the managing editor of “International Security”—who, according to Betts, “forgot” the conversation about the origins of the research.
“In retrospect, it should have all been done in writing,” Betts says.
The former Harvard visiting professor attributes much of the unease about the situation to the “axiomatic suspicion in the academic community” towards the government, following the radicalism of the 1960s and the Vietnam War.
Betts says that the alternative to concealing research sponsors is to not publish the research at all—a prospect he considers unacceptable.
“A natural value of the academic profession is that the knowledge it generates should be as widely available as possible,” he says.
Betts also denies that the CIA had any influence on his research, and further says that he believes it is rare that the CIA will try to frame the research it has requested.
Preston B. Golson ’02, media spokesperson for the CIA Office of Public Affairs, adds that while the CIA is sometimes obligated to keep research classified, “it’s not the policy or practice of the Agency to censor academic work. ... It would be wrong, however, for anyone to equate classifying sensitive information with censorship.”
NAVIGATING FUNDING POLICY
The government funds the “overwhelming majority” of scientific research on campus, according to B.D. Colen, Harvard’s senior communications officer for University science. But, he adds, money from the CIA comprises a negligible part of that sum.
In fact, Colen says there is currently no CIA-sponsored research at Harvard, and the small number of CIA-funded projects over the past ten years have all been unclassified.
“We do not do classified work at Harvard,” Colen says, adding that donors may not censor research they have funded but are allowed to review work 30 days in advance of publication.
When organizations do reach out to professors to conduct research for them, the contracts must meet a strict set of guidelines provided by the Harvard Office for Sponsored Programs, which facilitates outside funding of University research.
According to “Principles and Polices that Govern Your Research, Instruction, and Other Professional Activities,” a rule book published by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, “The source of sponsorship and the purpose of the research must be of such a nature that they can be publicly disclosed.”
Exceptions to this rule are allowed, but must be approved by the Dean of the Faculty, the Committee on Research Policy, or the Committee on Professional Conduct.
IS IT WORTH IT?
Administrators at the University say they understand that while it is sometimes necessary, accepting money from outside sources requires discretion.
Tad J. Oelstrom, director of the National Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School, says that the integrity of research done with any source of outside funding—whether from the government or not—is at risk.
“Government grants are good because they’re very well spelled out and provide a reliable source of money for the duration of the project. But they come with many legal and regulatory restrictions,” adds Kevin Ryan, executive director for research at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.
Kennedy School Professor Matthew Bunn—who has worked in the past as an adviser to the federal intelligence community—notes that grants come with a stipulation of prior review more often than most people assume.
But Bunn says that when reviewing funding offers, he is more concerned about whether or not donors have ulterior motives for the research that is being conducted.
He adds that he believes that there can be a fruitful partnership between academia and intelligence agencies.
“I think it is very worthwhile for the country if the intelligence community is well-informed,” he says. “That’s why we spend tens of billions of dollars a year on having an intelligence community.”
Unlike the Center for Middle Eastern Studies of 25 years ago, the Center currently has no projects funded by the CIA, and has not had any for at least the last five years, according to CMES Administrator Alison G. Howe.
According to Baber Johansen, the current director of CMES, the implications of working with any funding source are particularly relevant to the institution today, as the organization’s mission of sending students to the Middle East relies on strong relationships with international contacts.
Johansen says he believes that accepting grants from the CIA would likely damage the connections CMES has established in the Middle East—connections that are more important to the mission of the center than the CIA’s money.
“I would tend to think that an academic institution should not be funded by a secret service,” he says. “Weight that against our core mission—and that is contact with the Middle East—[and] I would see a conflict.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When James A. Messina ’86 recalls the social scene during his time at Harvard, he remembers falling asleep late on a weekend as The Isley Brothers’ “Shout” blasted from a room upstairs.
“Even in those days, it wasn’t like everyone headed off to the library,” says Messina, who served as the chair of the House Committee for North House—now known as Pforzheimer House. “There was always somewhere to have parties that were fun and good-natured.”
Likewise, Angela F. Schroeder ’86, the first female chair of the Kirkland House Committee, says one her fondest memories was hosting the “very popular” keg parties for the House on weekends.
“Rather than go out to bars in Harvard Square, students preferred to come to parties on campus because they knew they would run in to their friends,” Schroeder says.
But social gatherings on campus became more confined within Houses and individual dorm rooms when Massachusetts adopted a new law in June 1985 increasing the legal drinking age from 20 to 21. The hike was in response to federal legislation that required all states to enforce a drinking age of 21 or risk losing government highway funds.
ADOPTING THE NEW POLICY
According to Messina, Harvard parties in the 1980s involved mingling and dancing—as well as social drinking.
The drink of choice, according to Messina, was a cold can of beer, while the screwdriver came in at a close second because “it’s cheap and easy to make,” he says.
In response to the new state law, the College modified its liquor policy in October 1985. The revised policy not only reflected the new drinking age, but also added stricter enforcement procedures aimed at preventing all underage drinking.
Prior to this revision, according to Harvard First Marshal Joel A. Getz ’86, the alcohol rules on campus were reasonably lax.
“My sense is that there was not a lot of enforced restriction on alcohol consumption on campus [prior to the new policy],” he says. “I think the philosophy behind it was that people were better off drinking on campus, i.e. close to home, than going out into Boston to a bar and potentially having a problem further away.”
Under the new rules, only those with proper identification were able to obtain alcohol at House functions.
In addition, the new policy required advance College approval to serve alcohol in Harvard buildings when minors were present, and mandated that food and non-alcoholic beverages must be available when alcohol was served.
“It just became a big nuisance and introduced new complexities [to hosting parties],” Schroeder says, adding that the Kirkland House Masters at the time were “very strict about following all the rules.”
As a result, dorm rooms became a more popular location to socialize, because they were considered private parties, and therefore subject to less stringent rules.
To get their dose of alcohol, some students would even travel to nearby states, such as Vermont, where the new minimum age drinking law did not take effect until 1986, Messina says.
Messina adds that while he “wasn’t too thrilled” about the new restrictions, he was not militantly opposed.
“It was still somewhat reasonable to me at the time,” he says.
ADAPTING TO NEW RULES
After the College implemented the new policy, many students voiced their worries about the potential decline in social life.
“When you host a party, you want to include everyone,” Schroeder says. “[The new policy] limited the number of people that came.”
In spring 1986, the Undergraduate Council’s residential life committee published a 10-page report that analyzed some of the detrimental effects of the new alcohol policy on House life. Houses would incur new financial burdens because “events not serving alcohol are expensive. Some elaborate theme must be conceived and paid for, and creative, relatively expensive refreshments must be served,” the report said.
“We definitely had non-alcoholic parties, which were themed to try to have events that people can get excited about,” Messina says.
To resolve students’ concerns, the Undergraduate Council passed a resolution calling on the College to establish a special fund to give Houses more money to throw creative parties—an initiative which was then approved by then-Dean of the College L. Fred Jewett ’57. The fund also covered the cost of hiring bouncers to check IDs at events which did serve alcohol.
“Dean Jewett very wisely said, ‘We will make it easier for you to pay the expense,’” says Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67, who served as the assistant dean of the College for the House system at the time.
THE EFFECT
Despite worries about the deterioration of the social scene, Dingman, Getz, Messina, and Schroeder all say the new policy was not especially disruptive.
“I didn’t see the law changing the social dynamics at Harvard, since it was still a relatively new issue,” Getz says.
In fact, the majority of students in the Class of 1986 were unaffected, as most had already turned 21 by the time the law was put into effect. In addition, a grandafther clause allowed those who had turned 20 before the passage of the law to retain their drinking rights.
Dingman says he believes there was a bigger culture change in 1979, when the Mass. drinking age increased from 18 to 20.
“When I was a senior tutor in Leverett House [in 1978], we were able to, in addition to serving sodas and lemonade, serve wine and beer,” Dingman says.
“We seldom found ourselves aware that people were abusing [alcohol],” he adds.
Once drinking became illegal for 18- and 19-year-olds, Dingman says fewer students reached out to proctors or tutors as a source of help.
“Drinking that is happening underground has its risks, because students regrettably refuse to seek help,” Dingman says.
TODAY’S POLICIES
Today, the  College alcohol policy distinguishes between private events, House Committee and House events, and large House events, and specifies particular rules pertaining to each event type.
With the exception of private events in Houses, all parties that serve alcohol must procure HoCo members or a Beverage Authorization Team (BAT) that checks IDs at the entrance to ensure that only students who are of age may drink.
Consumption of alcohol is not allowed in “public spaces except during authorized parties when an approved carding mechanism is in place.”
Dingman says he has noticed that students who want to socialize with alcohol often seek entertainment off campus—that is, in places like final clubs.
“That being said, there still are a large number of our students who choose not to drink,” he says. “Our challenge is to provide opportunity for them to enjoy and relax themselves where alcohol is not the centerpiece.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Arthur M. Sackler Art Museum opened its doors in October 1985, many involved in the project dubbed its completion “The Miracle on Quincy Street.”
The moniker was hardly hyperbole. Harvard museum administrators had recognized the need for an extension to the overcrowded Fogg Art Museum since the 1950s, but the proposal was slow to gain traction, says former Fogg Director and Professor of Fine Arts Seymour Slive.
After a construction plan was formed in the 1970s, it seemed that the building would finally be realized. But the project suffered setbacks—and a month-long cancellation—in the early 1980s, making the eventual opening of the Sackler all the more remarkable.
Twenty-five years later, the Sackler serves a vital role for the Harvard art community, as the museum has continued to showcase a selection of important Harvard artwork while the Fogg Art Museum—generally seen as the center of Harvard’s art collection—has been closed for renovations since 2008.
But the Sackler’s place in the Harvard art world is set to change when the renovations finish, as the museum’s collections will move to 32 Quincy Street, though the building will remain “dedicated to the arts,” according to a written statement from Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
Nonetheless, for Harvard’s proponents of the arts, the 1985 completion of the Sackler Art Museum represents an unqualified triumph.
“The Sackler certainly was a reaffirmation of the importance of the arts at Harvard,” says George S. Abrams ’54, a prominent benefactor of Harvard museums who is also a former Head Trustee of The Harvard Crimson Trust II. “I think the entire community understood that.”
IT STARTED WITH SPUTNIK
The Sackler’s construction originated from an unlikely cause: the October 1957 launch of the Russian satellite Sputnik, according to Slive.
The launch catalyzed a renewed interest in science, and eventually drove the creation of the Science Center, which was completed in 1972. Slive says the Science Center’s construction rendered another teaching complex—the Allston Burr Lecture Hall on Prescott Street—a “white elephant.” As a result,  Fogg administrators began eyeing the building as a potential extension for the Fogg.
In developing the project, Slive’s fundraising efforts were complicated by Harvard’s own $250 million capital drive at the time.
“There is an unwritten law at Harvard that when Harvard is raising money, you can’t go to its benefactors,” Slive explains.
As a result, Slive had to seek out donors who did not have a historical relationship with Harvard. His search led him to Arthur M. Sackler, a prominent doctor and philanthropist, who agreed to provide funds for razing the Allston Burr building and constructing a new museum.
“Sackler’s vision was bigger than mine and was bigger than [anyone’s] at Harvard,” says Slive.
Once Sackler’s commitment was secured, a building committee was formed, and British postmodernist James Stirling was selected to design the project from a pool of over 70 architects.
AN UNEXPECTED HALT
By 1982, more than $13 million had been raised to cover construction costs and an endowment for the new museum, but the broader fiscal climate threatened to derail the Sackler entirely.
“That was a time of considerable inflation, and there was worry that the running costs—along with the attendant costs of guards and heat—would continue to rise, and ... there [wouldn’t be] enough money to cover that,” says Professor Emeritus of the History of Art and Architecture and former acting director of the Fogg John M. Rosenfield.
Ultimately, responding to financial concerns, then-University President Derek C. Bok interrupted a meeting of the Faculty of Fine Arts on Feb. 2, 1982 to announce that he was cancelling the Sackler project.
Bok’s decision resulted in an “international scandal,” drawing condemnation from across the University and beyond, Slive says.
According to a 1985 Crimson article, Ralph F. Colin, a member of the Fogg visiting committee, wrote to Bok at the time, saying that the President was either “unaware” of the Fogg’s significance or “unwilling to go to bat” to defend the institution.
“You may therefore take your choice as to whether ‘ignorance’ or ‘ignominy’ more aptly describes the basis of your behavior,” Colin continued.
By Feb. 22, Bok changed course, and announced that the building project could continue as long as the museum raised an additional $3 million by March 15 and another $3 million over the next three years.
With just three weeks to raise the capital, Slive began seeking large donors in order to meet the target.
“That was very painful. I had been out ... raising money. Then the goalposts changed and I had to raise more millions, and I was given a deadline,” Slive says.
Nonetheless, he managed to raise $3.1 million by March 15, ensuring that the Sackler project could continue. As a token of his appreciation, Slive distributed powdered sugar shakers—the closest thing he could find to a “tin cup”—to the half dozen donors who had helped him meet the fundraising target.
The shakers were engraved with the words “The Miracle On Quincy St. 15 March 1982.”
DESIGN WOES
For the students in the Class of 1986, who arrived at Harvard the following autumn, construction at the site of the Sackler was ongoing throughout most of their college careers.
But as the building took shape near Memorial Hall, not everyone was pleased with what they saw being built at the Sackler. The design of the building—including its light and dark brown-banded brick exterior, irregular window placement, and the two large pillars flanking the entrance—received mixed reviews from the Harvard community.
“The building itself was very controversial at the time. It was very striking,” says Tobias M. Lederberg ’86, adding that one oft-heard quote about the building was, “Someone better put some Ivy on that real quick.”
In a 1984 Crimson article entitled “Warehouse or Museum?” Stirling’s unorthodox exterior was described as “gorgeous” and “hideous” by Rosenfield and Sackler security guard Michael Pelham, respectively.
“Design students and professors come over from Gund Hall to laugh at it,” added Pelham in the article.
Uncertainty about the design was compounded by Harvard’s inability to secure community approval to build a proposed bridge over Broadway Street that would have linked the Sackler and the Fogg, Rosenfield says.
Local citizens charged that the connector—which would also have served as a way to transport artwork—would block out sunlight, detract from its surroundings, and might even be a traffic hazard. A vote on the proposal by the mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Association led the Association to adopt no formal position on the bridge, though the majority of members were opposed to the plan.
University officials decided to indefinitely postpone the building of the bridge, and Stirling finished construction of the building with the Fogg and Sackler still not visibly connected.
But despite the controversies, Slive says he was thrilled with the completed museum, which represented the fruit of a decade’s worth of his efforts.
“People are very critical of new architecture,” he says. “You can argue that it looks like a warehouse. But I found it brilliant.”
ENJOYING THE ARTS
Despite the complications that had marked its inception and construction, the opening gala at the Sackler was, by all accounts, a joyous affair.
“We had a big ball,” Slive says of that October night. “Sackler came with a big red sash [and] my assistant ... wore a wonderful hat which was a model of the building. There was so much to celebrate.”
Abrams says the opening represented an “exciting moment” for the art community.
“There was great anticipation for how the Sackler Museum would provide wonderful new facilities for the Harvard art collections,” he says.
Harvard undergraduates were also welcome at the black-tie affair, and many say they chose to attend the celebration.
“What was especially unique about it was that students were encouraged to attend this worldwide event with luminaries,” Lederberg says. “It was one of the more unique social events of the whole time I was there.”
And in the months that followed, many students were able to gain a new appreciation of Harvard artwork, some of which had not been displayed for years due to the space constraints at the Fogg.
“Going to experience the Sackler was a little pressure release, a stress release, by focusing your thoughts on and enjoying something beautiful,” says Georgette A. Farkas ’86. “As a student, it felt like a place to escape and be inspired.”

While the rest of their classmates are busy enjoying lunch in Harvard Square and strolling across campus with family and friends, Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 and Molly O. Fitzpatrick ’11 will be downing cough drops and speaking to a mirror, respectively.
The two soon-to-be Harvard alumni will be delivering this year’s Ivy Orations—traditionally light-hearted addresses—to an audience of 10,000 during today’s Class Day exercises in Tercentenary Theatre, and while they each have different “pre-speech treatments,” as Levin-Gesundheit puts it, both admit they are a little nervous for the big moment.
“My mom said 10 or 10,000 people is the same,” Levin-Gesundheit said. “I’m not sure that’s actually true.”
Levin-Gesundheit and Fitzpatrick will be joined by Laura Jaramillo ’10-11 and Timothy J. Lambert ’11, who will present the more serious Harvard Orations at the ceremony.
In addition to the speakers, who were chosen by the Senior Class Committee (SCC) and Harvard Alumni Association from more than 70 applicants, four students will perform this year’s Class Ode. Andrew G. Brownjohn ’11, Bridget P. Haile ’11, Hannah M. Horowitz ’11, and Matthew D. Trout ’11 will perform the two verses—sung to the tune of Fair Harvard—which Horowitz, Trout, Andrew G. Maher ’11, Christine K. Son ’11, and Shaun T. Vigil ’11 composed.
Other speakers for the ceremony will include Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds and former “Saturday Night Live” actress Amy Poehler.
The senior speakers, performers, and Class Committee will be meeting Poehler for lunch before the ceremony—which Fitzpatrick said makes her more nervous than delivering her speech.
“I’m pretty sure I’m going to spend an hour quoting ‘Parks and Recreation,’ until she moves to sit somewhere else,” Fitzpatrick said.
She is not the only one eagerly anticipating Poehler’s presence on campus.
“I’m hoping to make her my best friend,” said Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11, Eliot House representative on the SCC, who will be introducing Poehler.
Joining the lineup of high-profile comedians at the University today is Alec Baldwin, one of the stars of NBC’s hit show “30 Rock,” who will be delivering the Class Day address at Harvard Law School.
Despite a history of eminent legal scholars and jurists at Class Day, choosing a speaker known for his humor is not out of character for the Law School, according to Paul J. Ray, an HLS class marshal who was on the committee that invited Baldwin.
“We wanted to find someone who was a good speaker, who was funny—has insights into the way the world works,” Ray said.
“It’s a good choice ... something lighthearted the day before a more serious ceremony,” added Jennifer D. Dein, who is the former student body president at the Law School.
The spirit of joviality is one that students hope will permeate Class Day activities across the University, according to SCC Marshal Kurt Tsuo.
“Class Day is really a celebration of the class,” Tsuo said. “I think I’m most excited for the orations [Wednesday].”
Benjamin H. French ’11, Leverett House Representative on the SCC, added that the presentation of the Ames Award to one male and one female during today’s ceremonies gives the Class of 2011 a chance to recognize “unsung heroes” of the class.
“I’m most excited probably to spend the day with my classmates,” he said. “[It’s] kind of a day that we’ve created, about us and for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Arthur M. Sackler Museum faces an uncertain future as renovations of the Fogg Art Museum near completion, slated for late 2013.
The Sackler’s art collections will move into the renovated facilities at 32 Quincy Street—which will now be known as the Harvard Art Museum—along with the collections of the Busch-Reisinger Museum, according to an emailed statement from Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Jeff Neal.
“The University is currently engaged in a collaborative process involving the art museums, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the central administration to ensure that the building continues to be dedicated to the arts,” Neal wrote. He did not address whether the Sackler building will continue to serve as a display space.
A number of professors in the Department of History of Art and Architecture—housed in the Sackler building—speculated that the University will not continue to use the Sackler for exhibiting art.
HAA Professor Henri Zerner said that he believes that the Sackler will continue to house the department’s administrative offices and—if funds permit—the Fine Arts Library. During the Fogg renovation, the Fine Arts Library has occupied a space in Littauer, a building primarily used by the Economics department.
Zerner went on to say that housing both the HAA offices and the library in the Sackler would be the “best use” of the building.
“I don’t have any strong sentimental attachment to buildings,” Zerner said of the Sackler’s potential repurposing. “I think the new arrangement will be better.”
Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts James S. Ackerman said that if Harvard can afford it, it would be useful to house the department and library in the same building.
“They’ve been talking about moving the library back where the [Sackler] galleries are,” Ackerman said. “If they are penny pinching, they might not be able to afford it. On the other hand, the Department of Economics desperately wants to get rid of our library—that is going to be the issue of the future.”
“They don’t want the library there, we don’t want the library there. But how do you convert a structure to contain many tons of books? The floors were built for galleries, not the load that a library would bring to it,” he added.
Professor Emeritus of Asian Art and former acting director of the Fogg John M. Rosenfield, however, said that without any concrete plans for the future of the Sackler, it is hard to make judgements about how the building should be repurposed.
“Nobody has told me anything concrete or specific about it. You hear rumors about it, but I don’t know how much substance there is to it,” Rosenfield said.
Rosenfield said the future of the Sackler is largely dependent on the success of the Fogg renovations.
“The Fogg will be our new place of operation, our new laboratory so to speak, and we will have to see how well it actually functions,” Rosenfield said.
Former director of the Fogg Seymour Slive—who largely spearheaded the creation of the Sackler, which opened in 1985—said that while he is uninvolved in the current decision-making process, he hopes that the Sackler can continue to serve as a display space for art.
“It’s very sad to me to think of it no longer being a museum,” he said. “But who knows, the new Fogg may not be large enough, and [maybe] they’ll use it again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust invoked the late Rev. Peter J. Gomes at yesterday’s Baccalaureate Service to encourage members of the Class of 2011 to maintain their identities as they go off to achieve their goals.
As seniors wearing caps and gowns listened in Memorial Church and their parents and guests heard over loudspeakers in Tercentenary Theatre, Faust spoke at the College’s Baccalaureate Service, a traditional prelude to Thursday’s Commencement ceremony.
“Be who you are, or miss discovering who you are,” Faust said.
Faust’s speech drew heavily from Gomes, the legendary Memorial Church minister who died in February.
For the past four decades, Gomes had presided over the Baccalaureate ceremony and was an institution at Harvard Commencement.
“As a man of multiple labels, Peter Gomes was a little ahead of his time,” Faust said. “The black, gay, and once Republican preacher did not fit any categorization.”
“Even if you never came to a Sunday service or took his course on the history of Harvard, you could feel the ripple of his singularity,” Faust said. “As a man of words, he let no one finish his sentences for him.”
She encouraged the graduating seniors to maintain this individuality and confidence in their identity as they decide on their professional futures.
“The real question is how within the possible narratives can I most be myself,” Faust said. “How will I finish my own sentence, when I say I went to Harvard and then I—.”
Faust maintained a light tone through some of the speech, at one point joking about how, one day, the students might rediscover the hot breakfast that was lost to budget cuts two years ago.
The Baccalaureate Service, which Faust called one of Harvard’s “ancient and curious customs,” included readings from different holy texts, including the Bible and the Quran. The excerpts were read in their original languages as well as in English.
“It was pretty much like being at the U.N.,” Abel Acuna ’11 said, adding that he thought the service was a celebration of diversity at Harvard.
Lisa M. Ackerman ’11 said she appreciated the personalized nature of Faust’s speech, as it addressed specific students’ achievement throughout their years at Harvard.
“It was definitely a tribute to everyone’s accomplishment,” Ackerman said.
Faust became president in 2007, the same year the Class of 2011 arrived at Harvard.
“Our four years at Harvard were also her four years as the President,” Acuna said.
Acuna, who said he was live blogging on his Twitter account during the service, said Faust’s speech was the best part of Baccalaureate because it made him reflect on his years at College.
Still, Acuna said it had not quite dawned on him that there were only two days remining in his college experience.
“[Graduation] is something that I have been waiting to happen since I got here,” Acuna said, “and I will feel it and believe it after it’s done.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A campus security guard allegedly stole a laptop and an electronic tablet from a pair of undergraduates last fall.
Stephen Evans, a supervisor with the private security company Securitas, was arraigned on April 7 for one count of larceny for allegedly stealing a MacBook Pro laptop valued at $2,000 and an Apple iPad valued at $500. A non-guilty plea was entered for Evans at the Cambridge District Court.
On Oct. 11, two undergraduates reported that their laptops had been stolen from inside their back packs in room B04 in the basement of Holworthy Hall. The students had gone to eat between 12 a.m. and 2:15 a.m., leaving their bags behind. The laptops were the only items stolen, according to the incident report.
On Dec. 12, Harvard University Police Department officers responded to a report of stolen property from the B-entryway of Kirkland House. A student had come back to his room that morning to find his laptop and iPad missing. According to the incident report, there were no signs of forced entry into either the entryway or the student’s room.
Using logs of IP addresses and device-specific Media Access Control addresses aggregated by the University, HUPD was able to determine that a stolen laptop was being used at the Securitas guard station by Wigglesworth.
Using this information, along with swipe data from the incident in Kirkland in December, police later identified Evans as a possible suspect in the case.
On Feb. 8, HUPD officers received an email alert that the targeted MAC address had entered the network. They arrived at the guard station where Evans was supervising but had stepped out.
The officers located Evans’ car in Allston and waited until he arrived after finishing his shift to search it. In it they found one of the laptops that had been stolen and an iPad.
Evans returned to the station with the officers and agreed to be interviewed.
Evans said that the laptop in his possession was purchased from a man at the T-stop in Harvard Square for $400. He said the iPad was purchased for $150.
But later while being interviewed, Evans admitted to stealing the MacBook Pro from a common room in Holworthy Hall. He also said he found the iPad in Kirkland House and “picked it up and just checked it out ... to see how an iPad works.” Evans added that he intended to return the iPad to its owner by leaving it in a room in the basement of Kirkland House.
The officers then removed the iPad from Evans’ bag and identified the scratched serial number to match the number to the iPad that was reported stolen from Kirkland House.
By Feb. 21, only two electronics were recovered from the two incidents where a total of four items were stolen.
At the end of the same interview, Evans denied knowledge of the other two devices—both MacBook Pro laptops—in the two cases, stating that he did not have an accomplice in the larcenies and that he had not passed on any of the items to anyone else.
“I did not get greedy like that,” Evans said, according to the incident report. “I did something I was not raised to do but I did not [take the other laptops].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Reflecting back on his four years at Harvard, Noah A. Hoch ’11—a concentrator in Folklore and Mythology—said he is happy about his academic decisions.
Hoch said his choice to pursue the relatively small humanities concentration has given him a valuable lens through which to interpret the world.
“Folk and Myth is a dream,” he said.
But for students who may be less sure of their academic paths, a Georgetown University study published Tuesday raises questions about the financial implications of choosing one concentration over another.
The report, entitled “What’s It Worth? The Economic Value of College Majors,” examined the yearly earnings of full-time, full-year American workers ages 25 to 64 based on their college major.
On average, full-time workers with a bachelor’s degree make about $55,000, which is about 74 percent more than those with just a high school diploma.
What was most interesting about the study, according to co-author Michelle N. Melton, was that individuals’ choices of undergraduate major mattered in predicting their future income.
“Earning potential between one major and another can [vary] more than 300 percent,” said Melton, a research analyst at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.
In fact, the annual financial payoff for those with a counseling-psychology major came in at roughly $29,000. In contrast, those with a degree in petroleum engineering earned $120,000.
The report also considered racial and gender differences in earnings. Among individuals who pursue the same major, men earn more than women in virtually every instance. Furthermore, whites earn more than all other races in 10 of the 15 groups of majors. For example, whites with a degree in electrical engineering earn about $22,000 more per year than African Americans with the same degree.
“The point is not to encourage people to study a more lucrative major, but let them know that what they study affects their career and earning potential,” Melton said.
In response to the report, however, Hoch said he believes college education should not be about future financial gain.
“A better question to ask is not what will make the most money, but what will make me happy,” Hoch said.
Before declaring his concentration, Hoch said he was interested in pursuing a special concentration that focused on a social scientific approach to literature. Then he discovered Folklore and Mythology, which catered to his interest.
Hoch said that Folk and Myth is “an absolutely demanding program” that requires a thesis.
“What’s important about undergraduate education is that you learn to write well, think well, and push yourself to become more intellectually robust,” Hoch added.
Likewise, Daniel I. Lewis ’11, a computer science concentrator with a secondary in mathematics, said he chose his concentration based on his interest in programming, rather than out of a desire for high future earnings.
Lewis is currently in the process of applying for jobs. He said he would ideally like to work at Google for a year or two before doing a Ph.D. program.
On the other hand, another CS concentrator, former Undergraduate Council Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, said he did consider job prospects when choosing his concentration.
“Certain jobs are more accessible to people with a CS degree,” he said, adding that he had considered a degree in government before realizing that it “wasn’t for me.”
Still, Hoch said he has found his four years at Harvard to be rewarding on an intellectual level rather than simply on a practical level. After graduation, Hoch plans to move to China to teach.
“Who is the happiest after they graduate?” Hoch asked. “I am a happy guy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three new fellows will join the Harvard Corporation in July, University President Drew G. Faust and Senior Fellow Robert D. Reischauer ’63 announced Wednesday—marking the first step in implementing the comprehensive program of Corporation reform enacted in December.
Outgoing Tufts University President Lawrence S. Bacow, computer scientist Susan L. Graham ’64, and Boston businessman Joseph J. O’Donnell ’67 will join the Corporation, the University’s highest governing body. Their addition will give the Corporation more than seven members for the first time in its nearly 400-year history.
The three new members were selected after a five-month search by the Corporation and three overseers, who reviewed at least 500 nominations.
Bacow—who earned a J.D., M.P.P., and Ph.D. from Harvard—has served as Tufts’ president since 2001. Bacow has also served as the chancellor of MIT, where he oversaw many facets of the school’s education and operations.
Graham, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, was a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers from 2001 to 2007—serving as its president in 2006-07—where she played a major role in the creation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
O’Donnell is the founder and CEO of the Boston Culinary Group, a billion-dollar hospitality and food service company. Influential in state and local politics, O’Donnell was appointed by President George W. Bush to the President’s Advisory Committee on the Arts.
“Each of them brings expertise and experience that the Corporation will greatly value, and each has an intensity of commitment to higher education, and to helping Harvard adapt and thrive in changing times, that promises to serve us well,” Faust said in a statement.
The backgrounds of Bacow, Graham, and O’Donnell are in line with expectations that the Corporation’s increasing membership would result in greater specialization among its fellows.
Though he declined to go into specifics, Reischauer said last month that the governing board had made a list of 10 or 12 important areas of proficiency they would like to see represented on the Corporation.
Bacow’s experience as president of a research university has clear links to his new post, but his previous work with international partners may also prove valuable. Graham’s work in computer science is also an important addition to the Corporation, whose current members predominantly hail from the spheres of law or business. And O’Donnell’s background in the arts—another underrepresented field on the Corporation—as well as his business knowledge and political connections are also of value.
In addition, two of the three members chosen Wednesday are local residents, continuing a trend that began with the selection of Boston lawyer William F. Lee ’72 as a fellow in 2010. Since his appointment, Lee has made a point of being present on Harvard’s campus.
“These are three individuals with extensive governance experience who exemplify the remarkable accomplishment of our alumni across a range of professional domains,” said Reischauer, who chaired the search committee.
In the months before the announcement, some speculated that the expansion of the Corporation would also lead to more diversity in age and ethnicity among its members. However, Bacow, the youngest of the new members, is 59 years old, and all three are white.
The Corporation undertook a review of its structure and functioning in 2008. In part, the impetus for the reforms was the precipitous drop in Harvard’s endowment, which led some faculty and alumni to call for the Corporation to become more transparent and accountable.
Reischauer has said the reforms attempt to address these concerns.

As reunion week approaches at the College, thousands of alumni from dozens of different classes will flock to the Harvard campus. But it's a safe bet to say that no one will be around from the class of 1901.
Even without these would-be 130-year-old alumni, The Crimson archives are still here to offer us a brief window into the world of Harvard 110 years ago—the news, the coverage, and the quirks.
Not surprisingly, the University was not the bastion of diversity that it has become today. According to a Nov. 20, 1900 article, of the 1,993 students enrolled in the college, 1,116 of them were from Massachusetts. A grand total of 20 were from outside the US. Beyond that, almost 100 students in the freshman class attended either Boston Latin or Exeter.
Throughout the 1900-1901 school year, the major focus of the paper was Harvard athletics, and in particular, football. The Crimson ran daily stories about the sports on the front pages in an era when the school’s teams were the some of the best—and among the only—competitors in the country.
The front page story the day after Theodore Roosevelt, class of 1880, was elected president: "Only Substitutes Practice," an article on the absence of starters at practice the day prior. No mention was made of the presidential inauguration.
But football was a different game in 1900. The Crimson reported that of the 143 who tried out on Sept. 28, 1900, only four weighed more than 170 pounds.
Though football was the most popular sport, it was by no means the only one that the paper covered. A classified that ran on Nov. 14, 1900, offered up a "Throughbred [sic] brown gelding" to the paper’s readers. On Feb. 1, 1901, The Crimson described Yale—already an established athletic rival of Harvard's—and the upcoming roadtrip of its baseball teams.
Its opponents? Fordam, Georgetown, and the American League's Baltimore Orioles, who two years later would move to New York and become the Yankees. The Elis also played the Boston Beaneaters—today the Atlanta Braves—and the New York Giants.
The departure from professional-level athletic prowess is one major change, but it's hardly the only one.
Today, UHS deals with a wide array of health concerns. But rarely do they deal with malaria—an illness that the University confronted 9 times in the 1899-1900 school year. There were also three cases of Scarlet Fever and 42 of "overwork," the sixth most-common ailment afflicting Harvard's students.
Beyond its coverage of Harvard sports, The Crimson also reviewed most on-campus publications, and that included the work of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine. The reviews were overwhelmingly positive.
