After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My roommate once compared attending Harvard to getting lunch with Obama.
Imagine you have 30 minutes with the former president. Thirty minutes to learn something new or to impress him. Now, imagine everyone else around you is also eating lunch with Obama — you’re constantly worried about using your 30 minutes as well as they do.
This is how I feel about Harvard. We have four years to make the most of this incredible place. Eight short semesters to take full advantage of every opportunity and resource. And, to make it even more stressful, everyone around you is (or at least appears to be) doing it much, much better than you are.
So, how should you make the most of college?
We all receive unsolicited advice from friends and family about “taking advantage of Harvard,” but these words of supposed wisdom always sounded vague to me and more related to that person’s life than mine. I wanted to find out what the empirical research says about college success, and, I’ve read the studies so that you don’t have to. Drumroll, please…
To make the most out of Harvard, all you have to do is be yourself and make rich friends.
First, it turns out your parents were right when they told you to be yourself. A famous study by economists Stacy Dale and Alan Krueger found that, once you control for a student’s ability, going to a selective school like Harvard actually doesn’t increase your career earnings.
They examined thousands of tax returns and found that graduates of elite schools do earn more than students from non-elite schools. But, once you account for student characteristics, the earnings gap completely goes away, suggesting that college choice matters far less than the student’s ability. In other words, a student who was accepted to an elite school like Harvard — but didn’t enroll — averaged the same career earnings as students who did enroll.
Does that mean your Harvard education is entirely pointless? Yes — and no.
It means that our individual characteristics, most of which were decided by the time we set foot on campus, matter much more than what college we’re at (hint: That’s why I told you to be yourself). It also means that Harvard is really good at discerning who’s going to be successful, and you were accepted because of that. Now that you’re here, artificially contorting yourself to make the most of Harvard is exactly the opposite of what you should do.
Put differently, Obama (read: Harvard) invited you to lunch because he thought you were smart and personable. Instead of tensing up and stressing about every conversation topic — which would ruin the meal —  you should just continue being the type of person that got you the invitation in the first place!
Speaking of being invited to meals, let’s talk about making rich friends.
I may have fudged the truth a bit earlier when I said that studies found zero difference between selective schools and non-selective schools. The reality is that scholars have repeatedly identified that minority and first-generation students — but not their white and high-income counterparts — earn more after attending elite colleges.
No one really knows why these differential outcomes exist. One leading theory is that college is about the people you meet, which matters more to some students than others. If you’re a privileged white student, you’ll have family connections no matter if you go to Harvard or your local state school. If you lack those contacts, however, going to Harvard may help you build a professional network you otherwise would not have had.
One’s network on this campus is especially powerful. For example, a 2021 paper found that membership in a male final club helps your career earnings much more than academic success does. (Granted, the researchers’ dataset consisted of Harvard students from the 1920s and 1930s, arguably eons ago in terms of our University culture.)
But the general importance of one’s network has been confirmed by more recent research done by Harvard economist Raj Chetty. In his empirical analysis of the relationship between earnings and cross-class friendships, Chetty found that having wealthy friends is among the most important factors in upward mobility. Befriending that one problem-set partner who keeps talking about summering at Martha’s might just help drag you up the socioeconomic ladder.
Chetty’s data is granular enough to let us look at individual colleges, like Harvard. It turns out that our school has a surplus of wealthy students (no surprise if you’ve been reading this column). But Harvard also has many more cross-class friendships than the national average simply because most students, no matter their income, come into contact with wealthy classmates. And Chetty’s research suggests, these connections can be important in one’s success.
So, what are the implications for you? Should you stand outside the Porcellian trying to network? Should you sit next to the section kid who’s very clearly wearing a Rolex?
I’m mostly being sarcastic. Elite schools do help students by plugging them into a well-connected, powerful network. In fact, Harvard’s greatest benefit may be its match-making service – not its teaching – which exposes you to classmates that can help you out down the line. But, almost everyone you befriend here will go on to do incredible things. So, the “friend” part probably matters more than the “rich” part because nearly all of our classmates will have career success.
And that points to a broader lesson that there are still a lot of unanswered questions surrounding how selective schools benefit students, so we should have a lot of humility and uncertainty in extracting advice from this research. If I had to give a tentative distillation of the empirical data into a bumper sticker: Be yourself, but don’t be afraid to network.

A few weeks back, The Crimson held its first News-Editorial social in recent memory. I bring this up not to reminisce on the bacchanalia that may or may not have ensued, but rather to point out the significance of the event, the announcement of which brought with it joking cries to “tear down this wall.” The reason for this reaction was not a belated response to the death of Mikhail Gorbachev, but rather a wisecrack meant to poke fun at the institutional norm that defines the daily activities of The Crimson: the News-Editorial wall.
This (non-physical) wall separates the personnel and work of the News Board — which is devoted to objective, unbiased journalism — and the Editorial Board, which opines on topics. This strict separation is one of many structures put in place to ensure that The Crimson remains an objective source of news for the general public.
But, if not torn down outright, the wall and the goal of objective journalism it exists to attain needs to be reconsidered.
Firstly, objective journalism is impossible to begin with.
The Crimson, when deciding what news to cover, inherently makes a decision about what information is newsworthy. For example, this newspaper’s extensive coverage of the sexual harassment allegations and subsequent investigation against Professor John L. Comaroff reflects its judgment that abuses of power are so important to expose that every twist and turn of the situation merits coverage. This is uncontroversial in this case, but it is still an implicit value judgment.
The reason news organizations can never be truly objective is because their purpose is not just to give information to the public, but to construct a narrative that shows why it matters. Former Crimson editor and “father of modern journalism” Walter Lippmann ’10 wrote that “The function of news is to signalize an event, the function of truth is to bring to light the hidden facts, to set them into relation with each other, and make a picture of reality on which men can act.” In constructing these narratives, news organizations are inherently making judgments about what sort of narrative is useful to the public.
That truly objective journalism is an unattainable ideal is not a unique claim, though. Many believe that even if newspapers will never be unbiased, objectivity remains an ideal worth seeking. Yet objectivity is still a flawed goal.
In pursuit of objectivity, journalists follow a set of industry norms built up over time that defines what is newsworthy. As Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at NYU, put it, newsworthiness becomes like “a machine that nobody remembers how it was built.” In so refusing to make a conscious, agential decision about what constitutes newsworthiness, newspapers attempt to absolve themselves of responsibility and give readers the false impression that they are merely showing them reality.
But newspapers aren’t ethereal mirrors that offer, to quote Rosen, a “view from nowhere.” Like it or not, they play an active role in society, and failure to recognize that leads them to have problematic effects on the very news they report.
Take the Trump presidency. Whenever mainstream organizations reported on an outrageous, bombastic action by Trump, they were relying on the implicit judgment that a bombastic president was newsworthy. In doing so, they incentivized Trump to continue acting this way to dominate the news cycle. But did it have to be that way? As Ezra Klein has wondered on his podcast, what if the bar for covering Trump was that he had to “produce policy plans and say something worth covering as opposed to acting like an insult comic dog”?
In 1976, economist Robert Lucas published a paper that later became known as the Lucas critique. The idea was as follows: If economic models rely on the optimal actions of agents and the policy recommendations that they make inevitably change the economic structure and therefore agents’ optimal actions, then the recommendation itself becomes invalid. From then on, actors like the Fed needed to anticipate how the public would react to their actions in order to properly administer policy.
News organizations should do the same. In some sense, to pursue objectivity at all, they must be self-conscious of their non-objective role in society.
Where do these critiques leave journalism? At first, it seems like the only alternative to objectivity is subjectivity. But journalism can retain its mission of creating informed, active members of society without attempting to be objective in the strictly-defined present sense.
After Paris was liberated during WWII, Albert Camus advanced a new view on the ideal role of news organizations with his newly-founded newspaper, Combat. Camus argued that newspapers should embrace the fact that they need to make critical judgments to construct effective narratives. This “critical journalism” would then enable citizens to participate in society by making informed judgments. Most importantly, newspapers should be completely transparent about their critical mission.
Newspapers today should heed Camus and Lucas. It’s impossible for them to avoid making value judgments about the stories they publish. Instead, they should make concrete what their priorities are (Democracy? Civil Rights?), publicly acknowledge these priorities, and be honest with themselves about the role they play in the narrative. This is the only way that news organizations can fulfill their true purpose, to provide citizens with the information necessary to become active and productive members of society.

In a timely development for the upcoming Bostonian winter, which will likely feature not only the city’s characteristic strong winds but also a high potential for seasonal affective disorder, Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services department has launched a new slate of mental health resources. Among them is a telehealth therapy service called TimelyCare, which aims to provide students with “short-term, solution-focused therapy.” This expansion of campus therapy services, combined with a new mental health awareness campaign titled “We Are All Human,” is a welcome change as we grapple with midterms and prepare for the challenges of the upcoming season.
We had hoped Harvard would take action to address the mental health crisis on campus sooner, given the stark findings of a 2020 report of the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health as well as years of advocacy by students, including this Editorial Board. In the absence of adequate administrative support — this past March, for example, appointments with CAMHS came with up to six weeks of wait time — many peer-led organizations on campus have been working tirelessly to provide mental health resources. We applaud these organizations for leading the conversations surrounding mental health on campus, and we hope that Harvard’s new resources, although coming later than we would prefer, can help ease the burden on our fellow students.
The privilege of having access to such resources during a global mental health crisis, as well as a national shortage of mental health service providers, is not lost on us. Mental health issues are not exclusive to Harvard; nor are they exclusively caused by Harvard. We recognize the privilege that comes with being able to claim greater access to therapy services in the midst of a widespread drought.
However, we hold some reservations about the new campus initiatives. The prescription of an online module as a means to improve the mental health of already-overworked students, who must juggle academic and external responsibilities in addition to maintaining their well-being, seems overly optimistic. More generally, Harvard should ensure that its mental health resource offerings are accessible and inclusive. The more barriers that can be removed with regard to mental health care, including long wait times and limited cultural sensitivity, the more useful these new resources will be for the student body.
Grappling with the scope of the mental health crisis on campus also requires us to look beyond current policies in place and toward more quotidian aspects of campus life. For instance, extending mealtime hours in dining halls may prove beneficial to students, as it will help students struggling with eating disorders to establish a comfortable mealtime routine and also promote greater nutritional intake among students more generally. However, heeding this suggestion will also require Harvard to consider the additional burdens it may place on HUDS workers and to compensate them accordingly.
House life, similarly, occupies a sizable place in the daily experiences of the average Harvard student; Houses function as both places of residence as well as sources of immediate community. Indeed, the existence of tutors with identity or experience-based roles — including BGLTQ, international, and religion/spirituality tutors — in the majority of Houses confirms the function of Houses as communities with people to whom students can turn for support. As Harvard expands its mental health offerings, it is worth considering the addition of resident therapists or mental health professionals within each House. Resident-centric programming, such as group therapy sessions and other collaborative mental health activities, could improve students’ access to mental health services on campus and further strengthen House communities.
Still, changing the culture surrounding mental health at Harvard requires us to look beyond dining dynamics and House life. Academic discourse at Harvard does not happen in a vacuum; the quality of the discussions we are able to have depends on our well-being, and in turn, the pedagogical and academic practices we engage in also impact our mental health. Therefore, Harvard’s faculty training should not only emphasize faculty competency in teaching but also faculty competency in treating students with compassion, especially students that may be experiencing mental health crises.
Above all, we know that the worsening of mental health writ large is not a Harvard-specific issue. No one policy — not telehealth, but also not magically getting everyone to do high-quality therapy — would immediately fix a mental health crisis of this severity and scope. Harvard’s recent initiatives are a welcome start; but at some point, barring a sudden reversal in rising depression rates, we must also have societal conversations about what exactly has triggered this broad, international malaise.
We hope that we can soon approach mental wellness as a normal and necessary aspect of living, much like annual physical health check-ups, and expand access to mental health services even for individuals who are not in immediate crisis or experiencing long-term disorders. As updates to CAMHS merge with years of student advocacy, we are also newly encouraged in our ability to approach this broad issue: Let’s use the resources at our disposal, and continue to talk about mental health with one another, doing what we can to change the culture surrounding mental health on campus so that our cumulative efforts make a real difference in the lives of all those who we hold dear.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard-led team of researchers debunked popular myths parents and caregivers believe about adolescent sleep habits in a study published last month.
The study, published in “Sleep Health,” was led by Rebecca Robbins, a Harvard Medical School instructor and sleep scientist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and included Judith A. Owens, professor of neurology at the Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Pediatric Sleep Disorders at Boston Children’s Hospital.
The researchers identified the most prevalent sleep myths about adolescents and enlisted sleep experts to assess the myths’ veracity. The team then surveyed a nationally representative sample of parents and caregivers about the myths.
The study concluded that over two-thirds of survey respondents believed the three most prevalent myths about adolescent sleep: sleeping in on weekends is no big deal, later school start times will lead adolescents to stay up late, and melatonin supplements are safe.
“Number one was that going to bed and waking up late on the weekends is no big deal for my teen as long as they get enough sleep during that time. Now, 74 percent of caregivers reported that this was true,” Robbins said. “This is a myth.”
In an interview, Owens said she was motivated to conduct the study because of the prevalence of myths surrounding sleep among caregivers.
“I see a lot of adolescents in my sleep clinics. A lot of times parents will come in with these ideas about sleep and why their adolescent isn't sleeping well or why they're sleeping during the day,” she said. “From that standpoint, as a clinician, I thought it was really important to pursue this study.”
Researchers cited studies that demonstrated that schools delaying start times would result in adolescents getting more sleep, despite 69 percent of respondents believing it would result in less sleep.
“When we delay school start times, adolescents thrive: They're able to get more sleep, better maintain their mood over the course of the day, and succeed in the classroom,” Robbins said. “If we think about education, that's really what we're there to do: set our young people up for success.”
Owens said the ideal school start time should be 8:30 a.m. or later, citing a measure recently passed in California that required public high schools to start no earlier than 8:30.
Robbins said personal habits are equally important to improving adolescent sleep health. Adolescents could modify their sleep routine to reflect the finding that sleeping in on the weekends is actually not a good way to pay back lost sleep, contrary to popular belief. A 20-minute nap would be a better alternative, she said.
“That's one example of a modifiable behavioral change that parents and caregivers and adolescents could have a conversation about,” she said. “We think about changing their routines to better align with the evidence and the evidence-based ways to repay the lost sleep that they may be getting on the school nights.”
The researchers said they hope their study persuades both audiences — individual caregivers and institutions.
“Certainly, that's the goal in science: to do research that's meaningful and hopefully, change behaviors and policies,” Robbins said. “This paper could potentially be a tool for parents that wish to lobby in their school system to delay school start times.”

Belfer Center Fellow Grant H. Golub discussed the World War II-era expansion of the now-defunct U.S. Department of War during a virtual seminar on Thursday.
The seminar focused on chapter three of Golub’s dissertation, which argues Stimson drastically expanded the influence of the War Department in American politics. Golub, a Ph.D. candidate in International History at the London School of Economics, serves as an Ernest May Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs while he completes his dissertation on the War Department’s transformation into a key political player.
Golub highlighted U.S. Secratary of War Henry L. Stimson’s far-reaching organizational reform, which reduced the severe infighting that had crippled the military and left it “on the fringes of policy making.”
“These personal and policy differences really impacted the War Department's ability to shape policy at all,” Golub said. “They basically spent more time fighting one another than they did trying to convince the president or other parts of the Roosevelt administration — let alone Congress — to follow any of their presidential or political advice.”
Stimson managed public relations and created the Cabinet Defense Council, which held weekly meetings to coordinate foreign policy among department leaders. Additionally, Stimson’s War Department lobbied Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904, to institute conscription under the Selective Service Act of 1940 — though the department had not historically engaged in lobbying.
Ultimately, Stimson’s reforms increased the political power of the War Department from its previous state of “bureaucratic infighting” to its current position as a critical political actor, Golub explained.
He added, however, that few today are aware of the extent of the military’s political influence.
“One of the most pernicious myths about the American military is that it’s apolitical,” Golub said. “But they have their own political and policy objectives, and they work to try and enact them.”
During a Q&A session after the presentation, audience members asked Golub about critiques of Stimson’s tenure, including his rumored support for the atomic bomb.
When asked whether Stimson used his unique authority for good or evil, Golub said Stimson was “extremely racist” and “had a lot of discriminatory beliefs.”
“There are a lot of moral failures and also political failures that Stimon’s War Department is responsible for — like Japanese internment, the destruction that's created by the fire bombings, and of course, the atomic bombings — that would have to be included in any realistic assessment of of the War Department in this period,” he said.
Despite these failures, Golub said he believes that “things would have gone very differently and very badly for the United States” during World War II without Stimson’s influence.
In an interview after the event, Golub highlighted the public’s tendency to underestimate the level of disagreement that exists within the executive branch.
“I think that we underestimate how much bureaucrats and cabinet officials and people throughout the executive branch of the government try to compete with one another through the various routes at their disposal to create eventual American policy across a range of issues,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association discussed ongoing initiatives and reviewed funding for a campus-wide laundry accessibility project at its general meeting Sunday.
The initiatives included HUA’s Blue Bikes subsidy program and an upcoming Declaration Day event. HUA Co-President Travis Allen Johnson ’24 also presented campus safety concerns raised in town hall meetings held last week.
HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Johnson kicked off the meeting by announcing the pair had been selected to serve on the search committee for Harvard’s new Dean of Students. Katherine G. O’Dair vacated the role in August when she was appointed University Marshall.
During the meeting, Estabine and Johnson solicited student feedback on the search, offering gift cards to those who attend a session with the advisory panel.
Estabine lauded the HUA’s free headshot project, which provided headshots to 180 undergraduates this month. She said she hopes for institutional assistance through Harvard’s Student Employment Office at the next iteration of the initiative later this year.
The HUA leaders also confirmed they were working on an order form for their Blue Bikes subsidy program, which aims to provide single-ride passes for students at a reduced price of $1.
At a freshman town hall last Wednesday, students raised concerns about campus safety and security, which ranged from poor campus lighting to unsafe walking conditions between Harvard Yard and the Quad. At Sunday’s meeting, Johnson announced the HUA will meet with Harvard University Police Department Chief Victor A. Clay to address the criticisms.
Officers and attendees at the meeting also voted unanimously to allocate $250 to an accessible laundry initiative introduced by well-being officer Hana Rehman ’25. The project, which was piloted in Lowell House, will place tactile silicon markers on laundry machines throughout campus to better accommodate visually impaired students.
“This college accepts students without considering all of the accessibility needs they might need to complete basic chores like completing their laundry each week by themselves,” Rehman said at the Sunday meeting.

Former employees of the Ferranti-Dege camera shop, co-founded by Anthony C. Ferranti ’46 in 1955, would affectionately refer to themselves as alumni of “Ferranti-Dege University.”
For many, the experience of working and shopping at the store often transcended the curriculum at the university across the street.
For 51 years, Ferranti watched Harvard students and Cambridge residents learn the craft of photography at his shop, which he ran with his brother until 2006, leaving an impression on many who passed through.
Ferranti died in July at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he retired with his wife, Nancy Ferranti. He was 97.
Ferranti founded the shop with Al Dege and ran it for years alongside his brother, Charles F. Ferranti, who died in 2011. The camera store grew out of the now-defunct Harvard Barber Shop, co-owned by the Ferrantis’ father, Charles Ferranti, who immigrated to the United States from Italy.
The shop — which once resided in the space now occupied by Zinnia Jewelry — closed its doors in 2006, leaving longtime patrons to mourn its exit and celebrate the fond memories it created in the previous five decades.
“He made very good friends at Harvard that he kept throughout his life,” said Nancy Ferranti, his wife of 36 years. “He was part of Harvard Square, as a student and as a businessman.”
A former employee, Thomas N. Bethell ’62, wrote in a note to Ferranti that his work at the shop was the most meaningful aspect of his time at Harvard.
“I can’t count the number of times when someone has asked me where I went to college, and I say Ferranti-Dege,” Bethell wrote in the letter, provided by Nancy Ferranti.
“Getting to know you and Charlie and hanging out at F&D was far more important to me, and is much more fun to remember, than just about any of the classes I took — visited would be a better word — at Harvard,” he wrote.
The camera shop grew out of Ferranti’s experience as an undergraduate at Harvard.
James J. Casey, the store’s longtime manager, recalled that Ferranti would print slides from Harvard football games and project them in the store’s window all through Saturday night and Sunday morning.
“He hired a lot of college students, especially from Harvard, who needed the money to work because they were there on scholarship,” Casey said. “Tony and Charlie were brought up that you share what you have.”
Ferranti grew up working at the Harvard Barber Shop, his family’s business. He left Harvard after his freshman year to join the U.S. Air Force, stationed as a navigator in Washington state during World War II. After completing his service, Ferranti returned to complete his undergraduate degree, graduating in 1946.
Ferranti began his post-graduate life in politics, working for Adlai E. Stevenson II, the Democratic governor of Illinois who ran for president in 1952 and 1956.
In 1955, Ferranti and his brother opened Ferranti-Dege. While building his Harvard Square business, Ferranti continued his political advocacy, participating in civil rights and anti-Vietnam War protests, including the March on Washington in 1963.
Casey recalled one instance in which world-famous musicians John Lennon and Yoko Ono visited Ferranti-Dege, seeking a replacement part for one of Lennon’s video cameras. While customers and passers-by were captivated by the celebrities, Ferranti focused on making the sale.
“Tony really couldn’t care less about it. They’re just musicians,” Casey said. “It was a Saturday. It was a busy day, so let’s let everybody else just jump into things like that.”
After withstanding more than 50 years of change in Harvard Square, Ferranti was forced to close the store in 2006 due in part to waning interest in film photography.
“I will miss it,” Ferranti told The Crimson at the time.
Daniel Ferranti, Anthony Ferranti’s son, said his father was touched when a contingent of Cambridge residents came into the shop to give it a proper send-off on the day it closed.
“Right around closing time, they showed up with champagne and a chorus, and they sang to my dad,” Daniel Ferranti said. “He was simultaneously super touched and super taken aback, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him both that happy and that vulnerable.”
Anthony Ferranti is survived by his wife, four sons, three step-children, and 12 grandchildren.
Corrections: October 18, 2022:
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Anthony C. Ferranti ’46 co-founded the Ferranti-Dege camera shop with his brother. In fact, he founded the store with Al Dege and subsequently ran it for years alongside his brother.
A photo caption on a previous version of this article misstated the year Anthony C. Ferranti ’46 co-founded the Ferranti-Dege camera shop. He opened the shop in 1955.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students lined up across Tercentenary Theatre on Friday evening to hear best-selling author John Green talk about the end of the world.
Friday’s event kicked off Memorial Church’s 2022-2023 William Belden Noble Lecture series, which will center on the climate crisis. The lecture series was fo unded in 1898 by Nannie Yulee Noble in honor of her husband, who graduated from Harvard College in 1885.
Matthew Potts hosted the event, marking his first time leading the annual lecture series since he was appointed Pusey Minister of Memorial Church in the spring of 2021.
Green is the author of “The Fault in our Stars” and other young adult best-selling novels. He also founded widely popular YouTube channels, including educational series “Crash Course,” with his brother. In his latest work “The Anthropocene Reviewed,” Green published a collection of his essays discussing the influence of human activity on the planet.
In an interview, Green said the invitation to join the lecture series was “too great of an opportunity to pass up.”
“It's a huge privilege to be able to come to Harvard and talk with and learn from an extraordinary student body,” he said.
Green opened the speech by addressing what makes the current climate crisis and the threat it poses to humans unique.
“We're not the first species to become so powerful on Earth that we muck up the climate and threaten the planet's biodiversity by altering its atmosphere,” he said. “But we're the first species to know what we're doing while we do it.”
Green added that a slow response to the climate could result in “a generations-long decline in the planet's habitability by humans” — a scenario he described as “worse than a mere apocalypse.”
He said such a potential drop in habitability would be “a decline that harms first and disproportionately the most marginalized people, the most impoverished and vulnerable, who are of course also the people least responsible for global carbon emissions.”
Green explained that religion offers him a way to weather a future ripe with uncertainty and potential despair.
“What I need to know is what to do with this surreal miracle of consciousness, how to live and grieve and hope in a world where everything we're certain of will end, and for me the life of Jesus and the disciples offers a path,” he said.
Chinyere S. Obasi ’24, who attended the talk, asked Green how artists, writers, and creators could respond to the words of Jesus in a Q&A session following the lecture.
“I am deeply and pleasantly surprised both by how theological he was willing to be and how hopeful he is — how hopeful he is on our behalf and for himself. It's a truly magical thing to watch,” Obasi said.
Elizabeth Propst, a ministry intern at Memorial Church, said the church is focusing on the important, yet often ignored, aspects of dealing with the climate crisis.
“The church is trying to lead people in thinking — spiritually and just like in terms of mental health and emotional resilience — how are we as a species going to get through this?” she said.
Green ended the lecture on a hopeful note, assuring attendees that despite the harm human activity has caused, humans merit preservation in the face of the climate crisis.
“I want you to believe that we're worth it,” Green concluded, adding that “the human capacity for love is astonishing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chan Heng Chee, the former Singaporean ambassador to the United States, discussed Russia’s war in Ukraine and Southeast Asian politics at an event hosted by the Belfer Center on Thursday.
Speaking to a full room at the Kennedy School, Chan discussed a wide range of issues, including the politics of sanctions against Russia, China-Taiwan relations, and India’s growing global influence.
Chan called for global condemnation of Russia’s threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, saying “it cannot just be the West condemning nukes.”
“It’s got to be a global message,” she said at the event.
The discussion was moderated by Paula J. Dobriansky, a former State Department official who serves as a senior fellow at the Belfer Center’s Future of Diplomacy Initiative, which co-hosted the event.
Chan discussed Singapore’s response to the war compared to other Southeast Asian nations, noting that it was the only country in the region to vote in favor of a UN resolution to sanction Russia.
“Singapore took a very strong position because we believe the UN charter cannot be violated,” Chan said. “Big countries cannot invade small countries. We are a small country. We’ve taken a strong stance in every instance when a big country invaded a small country.”
She also discussed Russia’s influence in Southeast Asia.
“You will find that countries in Southeast Asia are very cautious about what is happening,” she said.
“Every Southeast Asian country except Singapore imports the majority of their weapons from Russia,” she said, adding that this trend occurs largely because countries want to show they are neutral in the U.S.-China relationship.
Chan said many people in Southeast Asia defend Russia by saying the country was responding to unnecessary NATO expansion.
“In Singapore, I have to explain why we were right,” Chan said of the UN sanctions.
Chan was also asked about China’s rise as a global power during the event. She said she does not “think China deserves to be demonized.”
“It shocks me how angry people are toward China,” she added.
She speculated that Chinese President Xi Jinping likely knew little about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine before it took place.
“If they had known, would they have left some 6,000 Chinese?” she said, referring to the number of Chinese citizens who were in Ukraine at the time of the invasion. “I don’t think they really knew it would go this far.”
China, the biggest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine, has not condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, blaming the conflict instead on the United States and NATO.
Chan also discussed the war’s impact on China-Taiwan relations, saying that “Ukraine carries lessons for China.”
“China must have, first, noticed that the Russian military didn’t do so well,” she said. “[China] must have been shocked by the immediate unity of the West and the U.S.”
“China is on its own timetable,” Chan added in reference to a potential escalation in Taiwan.
Ultimately, Chan said Russia’s war in Ukraine is unlikely to end any time soon.
“People will not stop unless they have lost enough lives, bled enough … before they come to their senses,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of college students from around the world gathered at the Student Organization Center at Hilles this weekend to participate in HackHarvard, Harvard’s largest international hackathon.
This year was HackHarvard’s first in person hackathon in three years. Under the theme “Ctrl, Alt, Create,” the event invited participants to submit coding projects that aim to solve problems across a range of categories, such as education, entertainment, and blockchain.
Nathan J. Li ’25, one of the student organizers who planned the event, said the theme was chosen as a spin on the common keyboard shortcut “Control-Alt-Delete”.
“We liked the idea of learning from the past,” Li said. “And adding new life to old ideas — like using the hackathon as an opportunity to revive projects that you maybe didn't have time for in the previous years.”
For many, the competition provided an opportunity for collaboration after two years of isolation. Thomas Kwiatowski, an experienced programmer who served as an open resource for teams during the event, said he felt this hackathon differed from past years by allowing attendees to connect in person.
“I've met people I've never thought I would meet and their willingness to go the extra mile to teach me their ways of thinking is probably the most considerable thing that I've ever experienced,” he said.
The HackHarvard organizers also acknowledged a difference between this year and the last in-person iteration of the event in 2019, noting that underclassmen played a much more significant role than before.
“Our team is basically entirely made up of freshmen and sophomores,” Li said. “So it's a very exciting time, where we have a lot of freedom to decide how to run HackHarvard, and we're discovering a lot of things along the way.”
Michael Dacanay, a competitor from North Carolina State University, said the in-person nature of this year’s hackathon made the event more accessible to participants. He said virtual programming often features delays and confusion.
“You can get to know each other, collaborate,” Decanay said of the in-person competition. “Also, the mentors are easier to ask for help.”
Yuhong, a student from New York whose team was competing for prizes in the “Most Funny” and “Most Useless” categories, said he enjoyed the in-person hackathon because it allowed him to see everyone else’s projects. Yuhong’s team created a weather application that would display slang words instead of traditional temperature readings.
“I'm really excited to see what everyone has created,” he said. “I've seen a lot of cool ideas — someone is doing VR, someone's doing image processing, tracking your hand as you move — so it all seems really cool.”
At the end of the program on Sunday, the HackHarvard judges awarded prizes to the top projects. This year’s overall winning project was Empath.ly, a video conference app analyzing the emotions of users. The second place project, We Are Sus Drones, uses drones to measure carbon offset and water quality. SenseSight, which came in third place, describes landscapes to visually impaired users.
Ultimately, as it came time to pack away sleeping bags and say goodbyes, many, like participant Justin Ventura, left with new friends and new skills.
“It was memorable, mostly because when I first came here, I kind of just assumed it was going to be super focused on the project, but it ended up being more like an experience of getting to know a bunch of other people,” said Ventura.

So. You’re bummed because you bought a cute summer outfit in August and never got to wear it. Well, what are you upset about? Put it on, and bust out your shades and sandals while you’re at it, because Flyby’s about to teach you the truth about the cold weather: you can literally just ignore it. Here’s our guide to how.*
Remember: Cuffing season is a conspiracy
As we all know, cuffing season was invented by the overlords. They want to convince us that we’re feeling sad and cold emotionally as a ruse to make us feel sad and cold physically. You think you want a real relationship? Please. What next? You want hot soup and a blanket? Chin up and jackets off, girlboss! Keep flaking on your section kid who won’t stop asking to grab a meal with you. It sounds contradictory, but old hearts create warmth.
Don’t give into the temptations of hot drinks
If you start ordering hot coffee, you’re admitting that you’re feeling cold and want to warm up. That means you let the cold win! Get up, soldier — keep ordering those iced vanilla lattes at Buckminster’s and assert your dominance over nature. You’re. Not. Cold.
Never put away your summer clothes
“Summer clothes,” “winter clothes,” what do they all have in common? If you’re thinking “helpful suggestions to maintain homeostasis,” you’re actually wrong. They’re social constructs. What’s the worst that could happen if you wear shorts in subfreezing temperatures besides normies judging you? Nothing (or at least, nothing you’ll be able to feel)! If you put away your summer clothes, you’ll accept that the cold is here to stay. In other words, you concede defeat!
Weather warnings are just warnings!
Wind chill warnings, winter weather warnings, they’re all just that: warnings. If they were mandatory, they would be called orders. I mean, put on your coat and gloves if you want, but I’m just saying — this ain’t lecture attendance. Missing three of these will not drop your score by one letter grade.
Learn from the greats
What do “Thriller” and “All I Want For Christmas Is You” have in common? Neither song ever says the word “cold” — at least, not in the context of the weather! If MJ and Mariah weren’t cold, why should you be cold?
You should be feeling warmer already! Congratulations on successfully seeing through society’s lies. We hope the joy of this discovery keeps your heart as warm as the rest of your body. <3
