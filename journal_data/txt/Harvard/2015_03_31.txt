After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For director Steve Kunis ’17, the decision to bring “The Last Five Years” to Harvard this semester was a no-brainer: "I think it's the kind of 'slice-of-life' piece that will always reach its audiences because it touches on problems with [one’s] career, identity, and relationships," Kunis says of Jason Robert Brown’s 2001 musical, which runs April 2-5 in the Adams Pool Theater.
The play, which follows the 5-year-long relationship between two people, has a unique structure; it follows one character’s story from start to finish, while the other character moves through the play in reverse-chronological order. Even though both actors are almost always onstage together, they interact only once, when their stories overlap in the middle of the play. Kunis says that this posed the show’s most important directorial challenge. “The dramatic lighting, the stage, which is pretty bare, and the costumes [will achieve this],” Kunis says.
Although musicals are often criticized for being one-dimensional, “The Last Five Years” intends to be a show just as focused on acting as it is on singing. “It's one of the few scores I've read where the music guides the actors through the plot," Kunis says. The rehearsal process has focused on creating characters that are complex. For actress Julia I. Biedry ’17, this means questioning past renditions of her character. “Cathy tends to be seen as the victim, but it's more complex than that...I want to bring out her strength, but also her spite and jealousy as the relationship begins to crumble,” Biedry says.
Actors and director alike are intent on creating a performance that is relevant to their audience. "I think [my character is] relatable to Harvard students because she's really hard on herself when she's trying to do what she loves,” Biedry says. When “The Last Five Years” opens Thursday, audiences will have the chance to see whether this goal has been achieved.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has a penchant for producing funny people. Indeed, it is a well-known secret that several campus comedy groups, particularly a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine, tend to funnel members directly to the aspiring comedian’s mecca Saturday Night Live. With such a propensity for supplying the show with writers, it was a mere matter of time before students started practicing for the big time while still in college. Now in its second year, “SKETCH,” which ran from March 26th to March 28th in the Adams Pool Theater, is Harvard’s stab at creating its own live, entirely student-written sketch comedy show. A few lulls in energy notwithstanding, the performance proved to be a consistently amusing affair, bolstered by a unwaveringly committed cast and a number of ingenious skits.
Directed by Karen Chee ’17, “SKETCH” played like an extended episode of Saturday Night Live, consisting of 12 skits and two digital shorts. Unlike SNL, however, instead of developing their content in one frantic, sleepless week, students had a semester to refine pieces and develop characters. Additionally, Chee opted to forego using specific costumes and sets for more stark staging. The cast donned black t-shirts and jeans for the entire performance, the only consistent stage pieces being a few chairs and a black backdrop. Whether a deliberate artistic choice or merely one stemming from the limited Adams space, it was nonetheless effective. Eschewing frills for a more minimalistic setup rendered “SKETCH” similar to an improv event, drawing the audience’s attention to the heart of the show: the dialogue and actors.
While the writing and performances were generally entertaining throughout the show, certain ones truly impressed. Clear standout “At the Opera” chronicled a late audience member’s tireless attempts to maneuver past an unsuspecting couple to reach her seat. Set to “Habanera” from the classic opera “Carmen,” the skit had no dialogue; the comedy thus hinged entirely on the actors’ physical comedy skills. Luckily, the cast delivered: Brooke E. Sweeney ’17 and Sam B. Clark ’15, two of the strongest players comedically, climbed, squirmed, and crawled without any reservations, making them compulsively watchable. And whether playing socially inept, possibly sociopathic roommates or merely sitting on the stage in silence, Mike A. Skerrett ’18 and Adam S. Wong ’17 possessed an ineffable, undeniable comic energy that elevated every scene they were a part of.
“SKETCH” also benefited from added flourishes outside of the live skits. Video shorts “Everyone is Out to Get You,” a 1950’s-style PSA revealing the dangers of ostensibly innocent townspeople, and “Morning,” which examined the morning ritual of a college student from the perspective of his body parts—ears, tongue, stomach, and more—were simple, original, and incredibly funny. Switching to a video format contributed another layer to the comedy, as the quick edits, music, and variety of shots allowed the cast take comedic risks outside of the limitations of the theater. Several running gags, including Sweeney clambering over audience members, recurred throughout the show. Lastly, while transitioning from scene to scene, Chee played songs that often related to the previous skit (i.e., “The Bird is the Word” followed a scene involving a bird-obsessed Snow White). The audience interaction and the perpetuation of jokes even after a skit’s conclusion were clever means of keeping viewers engaged and maximizing laughs.
However, the inclusion of a few underwhelming pieces, either feebly executed or direly low in joke density, prevented SKETCH from being spectacular. Opener “Chill President” involved a presidential candidate flaunting his knowledge—or lack thereof—of modern technological trends, including the perils of “pocket-tweeting” and his familiarity with “Craig’s List.” The cultural faux pas were initially chuckle-inducing, but the skit soon proved to be one mediocre joke inexplicably repeated for three minutes. Additionally, in “3D Printer,” two criminals attempt to construct items necessary for an impending bank robbery. These items were placed directly next to the printer, in full view of the audience. While the blatant reveal of upcoming jokes was bold, the choice quickly drained the skit of any comedic build, forcing the actors to exaggerate their reactions in order to milk some meager laughs.
But really, the success of a sketch comedy show does not depend on consistency; rarely do viewers remember a phenomenal episode of SNL in its entirety. Rather, the seminal sketch program has been so thoroughly ingrained in popular culture because of an unforgettable individual skit or character. “SKETCH” occasionally faltered, but its fantastic moments established it as an irrefutably funny piece of theater. Of late, SNL has been criticized for saddling its cast with weak writing; if “SKETCH” is any indication, in a few years the show should see itself on an upswing.

Opera, for all its wonders, is an art form with many barriers to entry. Ticket prices can be ruinously expensive, and those intrepid viewers who do attend often encounter large, impersonal performance spaces, tangled or bewildering plots, and challenging runtimes of three hours or more. The Boston Opera Collaborative’s version of George Frideric Handel’s “Rinaldo,” which ran at the Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology March 26-29, succeeded superbly in removing these impediments. The final result was a production that was compelling, well-crafted, and accessible to all.
“Rinaldo,” which was first performed in 1711, tells the story of Almirena (Laura DellaFera) and Rinaldo (Sophie Michaux), two lovers swept up in the turmoil of the Crusades. The original libretto is incredibly convoluted; it involves, in no particular order, magic wands, mermaids, a disappearing palace, several transfigurations, multiple conversions to Christianity, and a Saracen army. In this production, stage directors Patricia-Maria Weinmann and Greg Smucker and music director Michael Sakir cut down the original three-hour, three-act opera to a single 90-minute act. The resulting work moved seamlessly through a cleaner, more emotionally appealing story in which the political and religious connotations attendant to the Crusades were largely removed, allowing the characters’ relationships and individual struggles to take front stage. As the directors explained in the program, “For us, [Rinaldo] isn’t a piece about one enemy annihilating each other; it is about facing the enemy, looking beyond our assumptions[,] and recognizing our common humanity.” Considering that the original opera told the story of a Christian army laying waste to Jerusalem and forcibly converting its inhabitants, this new message came through impressively clearly.
The directors were aided in their efforts to create a more nuanced “Rinaldo” by the strong acting of the singers, particularly Sophie Michaux in the role of the title character. As in many Handel operas, the lead male part was written for a castrato and is now performed by a countertenor, contralto, or mezzo-soprano. Michaux elevated her performance through abundant charm and emotional vitality, moving effortlessly between the levity of a mischievous, infatuated boy and the gravity of a remorseful warrior forced to question the morality of his deeds. Although she lacked the vocal depth of some of the other singers—her performance had range and power, but she occasionally sounded strained for breath—she provided several of the opera’s most moving moments. After the abduction of Almirena, Rinaldo’s betrothed, the bereaved knight mourns his loss; Michaux’s rendition of “Cara sposa, amante cara” in this scene was achingly poignant. Shoulders rounded in pain, Michaux slowly set aside her armor and weapons, laying herself bare both physically and emotionally.
As Rinaldo’s counterpart, Almirena, Laura DellaFera also contributed to the opera’s newfound subtlety of theme. Her performance was playful yet assertive, adding dimensionality to what is ordinarily a passive character. Clad in the same armor as the male characters, DellaFera’s Almirena was confident, courageous, and capable. From the start, DellaFera took control of the stage every time she sang; her vocals were rich and precise, even when covering difficult scales and trills. “Combatti da forte,” in which Almirena exhorts a reluctant Rinaldo to do his best in battle, was one of her stronger moments, as the aria allowed DellaFera to exhibit both her commanding upper register and her understanding of comedic body language and timing. However, her performance of “Lascia ch’io pianga,” easily “Rinaldo’s” most well-known aria, was obstructed by over-embellishment. The aria, in which Almirena laments her captivity, was still affecting, but much of the music’s elegant simplicity was lost through near-constant variations on its original structure.
The role of the sorceress queen Armida, Rinaldo and Almirena’s foe, was sung with admirable panache by Jessica Jacobs. Jacobs drew eyes and ears with her strong stage presence and cutting, clear voice, but her performance lacked the emotional appeal of Michaux’s or DellaFera’s. As Armida’s consort Argante, Luke Scott delivered a similarly solid performance, yet one that also lacked a certain measure of transcendence. Scott’s most memorable moment was his rendering of “Vieni o cara, a consolarmi,” during which the power and resonance of his baritone became beautifully apparent. Garry McLinn, who played Goffredo, Almirena’s father and Rinaldo’s commander, did well in his few solos, yet seemed strangely stiff in his onstage movements and expressions. The ten-person cast was completed by Argante’s herald (Patrick McGill) and Armida’s four attendants, the Furies, from which Beibei Guan and Hailey Fuqua stood out in the sinuous aria “Il vostro maggio.”
The lush score was brought vibrantly to life by the New Vintage Baroque ensemble, whose accompaniment did justice to the delicately balanced harmonic progressions of Handel’s music. Arrayed on the theater’s stage, the group was often figuratively and literally in the spotlight, and they did not disappoint; their performance was so enjoyable that it could have been a stand-alone concert. Since the ensemble occupied the stage, all the action of the opera took place in the center of the floor, around three sides of which the audience was seated. The cast was thus able to interact with the audience in an incredibly personal and intimate way, as there was virtually no separation between audience and set. This minimalist ethos extended to the set design, which consisted of a variety of tall coat-racks that were variously used as trees, spears, tridents, walls, and other objects. The informality of the staging and set design was compelling, creating a spirit of community between the cast and audience. However, the costumes struck a discordant note; garish Halloween-style foam breastplates and polyester capes, they failed to mirror the creative, charming spirit present in other aspects of the production.
It was clear throughout that this “Rinaldo” was put on by a group of people who simply love opera and want to share that love with others. Occasional minor weaknesses were present, but they could not hold back the fundamental joy and passion at the heart of the show. In staging this production, the Boston Opera Collaborative has both illuminated a great work from the past and discovered a convincing path for the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s an eclectic bunch. They come in all shapes and sizes, old and young, acoustic and electric. On a windy Tuesday night, these 20 or so musicians are tucked away in the historic Club Passim, one flight below Palmer Street in Harvard Square.
The venue’s exposed brick walls and clustered four-person tables seem to glow in the darkness, punctuated by the electric candles scattered around the room. Occupying a world completely different from the one that is inhabited by a mix of tourists, students, and workers who walk the Cambridge streets during the day, Passim channels the vibe of one New York City’s Greenwich Village mainstays, like the Bitter End. Drop everything stressful and listen, the very walls of the place seem to echo.
Tuesday’s show, a weekly, free “open mic,” draws people ranging in talent, experience, and style. Indeed, the Cambridge music scene features diverse performers and patrons and extends from Harvard Square to Porter Square to Inman Square to East Cambridge and beyond. On a given night, audiences can choose from bluegrass, jazz, folk, rock and roll, and spoken word performances, shows that can run until the early morning hours. “The best thing about the music in the area is that you can always trust it’s going to be good, so take a chance on something you don’t know,” says Passim’s managing director, Matt Smith. “I think that in a lot of ways when you have a vibrant local scene, it’s sort of ageless.”
Starting in the 1950s, Cambridge became a hotspot for up-and-coming musicians: During the following decades, many jazz lounges, listening rooms, and other spaces opened up to fit the growing demand for daily live music. Artists who stopped and played in Cambridge left their musical mark here and often moved on to become household names. With the opening of more and more venues, today’s artists have built on their predecessors’ legacies and formed a community of their own.“It feels great to just know that you’re a link in this chain that goes back generations,” local musician Patrick Coman says.
Current performers both value the city’s rich musical tradition and continue to add to their own flair to that tradition. With a variety of shows and venues, the Cambridge scene promotes inclusivity, experimentation, and creative expression, according to local club owners, booking agents, and musicians alike.
The City of Cambridge’s recent history is grounded in musical tradition. From Joan Baez’s and Bob Dylan’s visits to Club 47 (now Club Passim) in the 1960s to the up-and-coming band Lake Street Dive’s performances at several venues around the area, the scene not only features a variety of music but also spans a great stretch of time.
Today’s performers value the city’s longstanding musical roots. In addition to supporting Baez and Dylan, Cambridge clubs and other venues have nurtured folk singers, jazz improvisers, and other artists, including Regina Spektor, Tom Rush, and Suzanne Vega. “I think you can definitely feel the ghosts and the spirits of those people,” says Coman, who moved to Cambridge after living in Oklahoma, Nashville, and Berlin. “That’s what makes [the venues] special.” One such venue, Club 47, opened as a jazz lounge on Mount Auburn Street in 1958. The club went through several iterations before becoming the Club Passim it is today. Since the venue needed a special license to have more than three instruments and to operate simultaneously as a restaurant, Club 47 transformed into a private, non-profit club and began to charge 25 cents for membership, according to Club Passim’s executive director, Daniel B. Hogan. Although the end of the 1960s marked the end of Club 47 because of persistent  legal trouble, Bob and Rae Anne Donlin bought the space in 1969 and transformed it into the Club Passim that exists today.
In Porter Square, Toad opened in 1993, and the Lizard Lounge opened a few years later, according to Billy Beard, the executive booking agent for both venues. “Cambridge has always been a hotbed [for music],” Beard says. With more clubs including Lilypad in Inman Square, Atwood’s Tavern in East Cambridge, and larger venues like The Sinclair in Harvard Square opening up over the years, the Cambridge music scene has expanded, providing artists with a variety of places to have weekly, or even nightly, gigs.
Performers can build upon and create dialogues with the city’s decades-old music history as they develop their own sound often in response to it. “Cambridge and Boston have got such a strong local music scene that—it is really one of those cities, like Nashville—that people know when they move here that there’s going to be this really strong base of community music that’s really high quality and really great,” says Club Passim’s operations manager, Kristina F. Latino ’13.
The club and jazz lounge scene around Cambridge thrives as performers bounce around from one venue to another, often frequenting multiple clubs in the same week. Bands typically start out in the smaller clubs and, with increasing publicity and success, move on to larger venues. Like an ecosystem, Cambridge’s venues nurture performers as they find their style, sound, and fan base and then build on what they have accomplished. According to Latino, this scene breeds not competition but camaraderie among the city’s many club owners, booking agents, audience members, and musicians. “I remember when I started working [at Club Passim] someone asked me…‘Oh, how do you deal with the competition from the Lizard Lounge?’ And the answer is, truly, that it doesn’t feel like competition,” she says. “We really are a community, and it’s a really tight-knit one.”
Local musicians say that sense of community has strengthened over the past five years with the opening of new clubs and the ongoing patronage of old favorites. Many people involved in music in the city—from the agents who hire bands to the players themselves—describes the atmosphere and Cantabridgian attitude as “tight-knit.” Some musicians feel like they can rely on one another for help, and they often do. “If I need a guitar player, I can get one in a pinch, just by making a couple calls—or if I need a banjo player to come record on an album or something like that,” says mandolin player Brian Carroll, who performed at Club Passim in March.
This community, in part, contributes to the singularity of Cambridge’s music scene and allows artists to grow and thrive here, according to Coman. Unlike the “intense” competition he felt playing in Nashville, Coman describes Cambridge music scene as friendly and inclusive. “I’ve been living here for about five years now, and I think what’s interesting about the Boston music scene is that it feels in some ways like a more close-knit music scene,” Coman says. “There are a lot of venues where you’re sharing a stage with other musicians. You’re sitting down on stage and playing with different people any given night of the week. There’s a lot of people that know each other’s material and can play it live.”
Networking, in this way, is a crucial part of entering the Cambridge music world, according to several musicians. For example, Tom Bianchi runs a weekly open mic at the Lizard Lounge, and the event draws in musicians from around the country. Bianchi’s open mic features judges who give feedback and award winners. The event allows performers to socialize, connect with their peers and colleagues, and find future gigs in the area. “It’s a good open mic because it demands a listening audience, so artists come to it, even people who have played for years...even people who technically may be above open mic talent,” Bianchi says. “Amateurs are welcome and also flourish because it’s a listening room….Sometimes you’re listening to someone in a bar... but they don’t get a fair shot.”
Coman says Bianchi’s open mic was one of the first places he played upon arriving in Cambridge. “It’s one of the best open mics in the country because there’s a tremendous amount of talent,” Coman says. “I think these high level events...make it easier to know that if I go here, I’ll meet 40 or 50 other songwriters. You can start building on that network of people. Events happen all the time where you can go as a new face.”
Booking agents and club owners say the small size of their venues makes the experience of attending a show primarily about the music. Affectionately dubbed “listening rooms,” rather than hole-in-the-wall spaces, the venues foster connections among the musicians, their music, and the audience. As opposed to clubs in other cities, where the bar scene and mingling over food and drinks may take precedence over the music, listening rooms here strive to ensure that the music does not fade into background noise. More than the room itself, the venues provide space for musicians not only to entertain but also to tap into their viewers’ minds and shape their experiences. “Well, there’s an intimacy for sure,” Beard says. “It’s not just the physical size of the room. As a performer…there’s a certain vulnerability that you experience as a player in rooms like that,  that lead you to create things that are immediate.”
The music at venues like Club Passim takes precedence over eating, drinking, or even talking with companions and people at neighboring tables. “It’s not background; it’s not a bar where people are chatting,” Smith says. “It’s a focused listening experience.” In addition, the setup of the listening rooms allow the audience members and performers to interact with each other more closely than people do at other venues. “You’ve got people basically sitting right on top of you, so basically everything you do is under the microscope,” Beard says. “It leads to really creative outcomes.”
According to several performers, having an audience there purely to listen to the music is different from how most people interact with music and musicians nowadays. Instead of plugging in their earbuds or hearing poor-quality recordings, audiences in Cambridge can look forward to engaging with the artists and often attend shows multiple nights a week. “Saturday is for the people who have to get their weekend on because it’s the only night,” Smith says. “People around here make it work with their schedules—that they can go out any night of the week.” Having shows available every night of the week has made the music scene more accessible to a variety of audience members, according to Smith.  “I don’t think that it has changed the audience so much as opened it up a little bit,” Smith says. “We have people that come to shows two, three times a week, or even more. Some that don’t live right in town.” Smith characterizes his job as an opportunity to “grow artists from opener to headliner”; he often introduces the Club Passim audience to names and faces they have never seen or heard before. “I actively seek out artists, as opposed to just being a place to present whatever sells tickets,” Smith says.
Cambridge often serves as the breeding ground for bands to develop their sound before an audience who appreciates styles from North African music to experimental jazz. Acquiring a sizeable, supportive fan base close to Boston, those bands then look to grow their following in larger cities. In addition, experienced bands on tour often play in Cambridge because they know that they will receive a warm welcome. Since Cantabrigians involved in and appreciative of the diverse music scene here often attend shows multiple times a week, their ears are attuned to different styles of music. As bands move from club to club around the city, fans can find and support their favorites. “The people from Cambridge like to rally around bands they’ve discovered,” Beard says.
Lake Street Dive, an indie jazz band, started playing at Toad on Sunday night, for example, and soon after moved to the Lizard Lounge. They since have been featured in Rolling Stone and have headlined shows at the Sinclair, a larger venue on Church Street which typically draws bigger names in the music world. “It feels really good,” says Beard, who first booked the band. Styles come and go, but the supportive audience remains a constant, according to musicians, and just looks to hear good, high quality music. “When I first moved here there was nothing on the radar of any type of country, whether you think of pop or traditional,” Coman says. He notes how those styles have gained traction around the area, as new bands step into the spotlight and experiment with their music. “I feel like people cross over to other genres, and there’s more of a community feel,” Coman says.
At its core, the Cambridge music scene owes its longevity to its depth and breadth—and particularly to its firm roots. “I think it’s all very deep rooted in folk music, but the umbrella term that they use now is ‘Americana,’” Carroll says. “It’s anything that has its roots in early American music—hints of bluegrass, rock-and-roll, blues, and folk, obviously storytelling kind of stuff.” Ultimately, Cambridge serves as a refuge for many artists looking to experiment and to hone their talents in front of a receptive audience. The venues provide the space for a variety of styles and songs to flourish. “You don’t have to go far to hear great music every day of the week,” Latino says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kiran Gandhi arrived at Crema Café, without fanfare, on a worn-out bike. Her composure, like her mode of transportation, was casual and down-to-earth. Gandhi, who graduated from Georgetown University with a double major in political science and math as well as a minor in gender studies, now splits her time between being a student at HBS and M.I.A.’s touring lead drummer. On Friday afternoon, Gandhi took the time to share her thoughts on the interrelation of feminism and drumming, intellectualism and art, and Atomic Living—her personal life philosophy.
The Harvard Crimson: When you’re drumming, you appear sublime as if you’re in another place. Can you tell me about that?
Kiran Gandhi: I think the coolest thing about drumming is that—because there’s not only four limbs that you have to be keeping track of, but it’s also playing with other people or to a track—you literally cannot think about anything else. Like sometimes when I’m in class, I’ll zone off…but with drumming, because it commands both your physicality and your mentality, it forces you to be present in a really sublime way, to use your word.
THC: Do you get that feeling anytime else?
KG: I get that feeling when someone empowers me with a new skill set or a new framework.
THC: How do you ensure that you devote enough time to these things that empower and excite you most?
KG: I have a way of thinking about this, which is that not only do I like to be focused, but I also like to be spontaneous. And so I always think about, what are the four or five things that matter to me most in this phase of my life—and this past year it’s been feminism, drumming, business, fitness, and Portuguese—and I basically try to hit as many of those every single day in whatever way possible…I say, “Okay, these are the things that need to grow, and I’m gonna allow spontaneity to nourish them in whatever way.”
THC: It sounds like we’re talking about Atomic Living, your philosophy on filling your time only with activities that invigorate or excite you?
KG: We are.
THC: And Atomic Living really embraces spontaneity. How do you practice that philosophy while also avoiding the temptation to jump at every interesting opportunity that comes your way?
KG: If I feel like my drumming is being nurtured by something, I’m okay with that. I don’t try to take on more in that area…. For me, when I have those four or five tenets, if one of them is being nurtured, I try to make sure that others of them are being nurtured. Because I know that’s when I’m happiest.
THC: You’ve described how you perceive farce in the way that in America we try to be productive, and so we separate our artistic passions from what we “do” professionally. What exactly do you mean by this?
KG: Yes!…. The people who in the beginning say “…I’m gonna keep feeding this passion,” that’s kinda what happened to me. And I look back on that and I think that’s why the M.I.A. gig was able to take off, because I kept feeding it…and basically…I shifted from that moment where I said, “Oh, I play the drums. Oh, I like to play squash. Oh, I have 10 extra activities that no one cares about” to “I’m a drummer.” It’s an identity.
THC: What was the most exciting discovery you made as Interscope’s first digital analyst?
KG: 50 Cent was about to put out his next single and the question was, “Do we want to release the single on iTunes first, or do we want to release the video on YouTube first?”.... So I decided to take all the top 20 most-grossing singles from Interscope from 2012…and my analysis showed that the sweet spot was actually to put out the single first on iTunes and then release the music video on YouTube between 10 to 14 days out…Basically by doing that strategy, you get this double spike in sales that wouldn’t exist otherwise.
THC: Are you involved in anything at Harvard that you didn’t foresee doing?
KG: Yes. I’ve been running…. The thing about running is that Boston people, they’re so resilient.… So that’s one thing that I’ve learned…is this discipline of, “No excuses, man.”.... If you…train that mental thinking through your running, and then you take it and you apply it to feminism, to drumming, to the music business, to learning a language, you can be successful.
THC: You mentioned in a talk you gave on Wednesday that M.I.A. is critical of your Harvard education, but you’re grateful for it. How do you reconcile believing in something and also being critical of it?
KG: I think having M.I.A. as a bit of a critical mentor…was very good because it reminds me while I’m here [to] take what you learn and don’t forget that a commitment to improving gender equality in the music industry is your thing. And stay with that, and use what you learn here to fix that.

The spirit of Henri Cole’s latest collection of poetry is beautifully encapsulated in its title, “Nothing to Declare.” This playful irony, of a declaration coyly denying itself, pervades Cole’s new work. His poems—which explore subjects as varied as the buzz of a bee and the preparation of Abraham Lincoln’s body for burial—are notable for their wonderful twisting and turning quality, as they explore given objects from many angles, and for the rich multiplicity of their vision. They recall artists such as Dickinson—Cole shares her appreciation for nature as a wellspring of poetry and her ear for a well-placed dash; Bishop, in her capacity for gaining human insights from natural encounters; and Jenny Holzer, a conceptual artist and sometime collaborator of Cole, in her taste for the tartly aphoristic.
One of the most compelling poems in the collection, “Lightning Toward Morning,” is emblematic of this turning and twisting technique. The poem begins beautifully, almost pastorally, with lush natural imagery that is so visually dense as to give the sense of being hidden, “thoroughly camouflaged” with the speaker in a “thicket of bayberry,” listening to the twittering birds overhead. Not until the very bottom of the first page does the subject of the poem become manifest—the bones of the departed speaker, from which “probably only / an examiner / could distinguish / a raccoon’s bones.” The poem further bends towards the grotesque and monstrous, as the sexual assault and murder of the speaker is described in powerful and evocative, if sparing, detail. The speaker’s body is sought, searchers cut through the landscape, closing in on her—and here, too, there is a certain brutality. What is especially powerful about this poem is that it doesn’t end here, in this horrific space. Rather, the final image is one that seems natural, abstract, dangerous, and complicatedly beautiful all at once: “where in summer, / toward morning, / lighting falls / straight down / to the earth.”
Cole also writes poems that turn brilliantly from the grotesque to the lovely. One of the best and funniest poems in the collection, “Dog and Master,” opens bizarrely, with an ermine shown in all its violent, devilish glory: “territorial, noxious, thieving…Mesmerizing its victims / with a snake dance, killing with a bite to /the back of the neck.” It is therefore a delightful surprise to see that the ermine being discussed is not out hunting, but rather is “huddled / in my arms for warmth,” a tender image. The speaker continues in this poignant, almost sensual style: “His rounded / hips shiver like mine.” There is a Bishop-like moment where the speaker communes with the ermine and gains some insight into his own humanity from this creature: “He prefers to give himself / up when hunted, rather / than soil himself. This is / civilization, I think, roughly / stroking his small ears.” The poem then twists away from this moment of supposed wisdom, wonderfully subverting itself. The ermine leaps out of the speaker’s arms and begins to gallop about the house, the speaker “chasing him around / the dining room,” haplessly shouting no. The speaker ponders the moment, first deciding that he and the ermine are “two stupidly / loving, stupidly hating / creatures” and then providing a powerfully strange, meta alternative—the ermine is “some weird / division of myself / split off and abandoned / in order to live.”  "Dog and Master" demonstrates Cole's special skill for unexpectedly changing directions and shifting tones.
The subject of Cole’s poetry is often his poetry itself, and the production thereof. In the second poem of the collection, “Free Dirt,” he allows a peek inside his home and workspace. This poem is marked by its frank tone—he comments on his “unpolished floors” and “rumpled sheets,” his habit of “making meals from discrete / objects,” and the nature of his day-to-day life: “Alone, I guzzle / and litter and urinate / and shout.” Of all this he speaks with a folksy wisdom: “We all have / chapters we’d rather keep unpublished, in which we / get down with the swirl.” At the end of the poem, he turns from discussing the production of his poetry to considering the nature of his self-representations in his poetry; it ends strikingly. Many of Cole’s poems feature naturalistic, unabashed details, a particular virtue of Cole’s.
Later in the collection, Cole presents a more positive vision of how to relate to language. “The Rock” begins with a Bishop-like vista: In the second stanza he pans up from a lake to trees to the sky. The scene is lightly but lovingly drawn; it also offers what could be viewed as Cole’s moral philosophy of poetry. He rejects “traditions and dogmas” as being like “well-made beds…to die in.” Rather, he speaks of the beauty of language and life with “no hierarchy.” “On my rock, it’s as if everything is lit from / below or from within.” Importantly, things are not lit from above; he is not the poet shining light down on the world, but rather he is accessing the light and spirit within things. On his rock, everything is calmly unified—“pelican, water, rock, cedar, sk, and me” and all is as it should be—creating “A sense that all’s right with the world prevails there.” He communicates with the rock, and in typical Cole style, this communication takes a doubled form: “Some kind of rock language, / with crude dents pressing my flesh, / and little fishes kissing my submerged feet.” This image seems to answer one of the central questions of the collection: how to be a poet. One must see the world from multiple angles, so as to be receptive to all the world’s forms of communication, from the “crude” to the “little.” Cole’s language offers a real sense of space and is always fresh.
This powerful, sophisticated, and complex collection, with its expansive range of subjects, varied range of styles—from lyrically thick poems with long lines to thinner, more sparing poems—and its multifaceted vision, communicates to readers in this double style, with language that is both “crude” and “little” with “dents pressing…flesh” and gentle kisses. It is an intoxicating and illuminating read.

Note: The following contains spoilers regarding season 3 of Netflix’s “House of Cards.”
Hello, Frank.
Remember us? The viewers? You used to talk to us every episode. What happened to that?
Don’t say you were busy, because we’ve been watching your performance as president—so we all know that’s not true. You make Walker look like an energetic activist. You used to be such a schemer, always manipulating people behind the scenes, stirring up controversy, and making things happen. These days, though, it seems like all you do is sit in your office and try to be a good little public servant.
You aren’t even a good public servant. Your political plans are absolutely terrible. Your plan for peace in the Middle East is to deploy troops in the Jordan River Valley? Even assuming you could get them installed there (turns out you can’t), what exactly are they going to be doing? Not contributing to the peace process, that’s for sure.
That looks like a great idea compared to your economic plan, though. Solving unemployment by having the government hire everybody? Have you ever taken an economics course? Even assuming this wasn’t a laughable plan, you want to fund it by slashing Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security? Do you realize how many of your voters are too old to work but not too old to collect benefits? How can you possibly think this is politically feasible?
Let’s talk about Jackie now. Remember back when you were a master manipulator, able to get anyone to do what you wanted with a good offer and a little time to talk? So what exactly happened here? You had all the time in the world, a thousand different incentives to offer and you couldn’t muster up the tact to say please and thank you a couple of times? At this point, it’s honestly like you’re a completely different person.
It’s not all your fault, though. You couldn’t have predicted Claire’s sudden decision to go completely off the rails. Most people who’ve been spending their entire adult life working toward a political career don’t abruptly give up on the whole enterprise when they’re just now getting close, but whatever. Claire’s apparently not most people, or rational, or good at being an ambassador…or able to notice someone hanging himself a few feet away from her.
And of course, there’s Thomas. You didn’t need to fire Tom because his book could be politically damaging, you know. You could have fired him because it was bad. The first draft at least seemed to be made up of good stories. The second draft was just a string of semi-connected platitudes about you and Claire. The only damaging information voters would have gotten about you if it had been published is that you have bad taste in novels.
Don’t worry, we’ll come back next season—are not many better original options on Netflix. But would it kill you to say a few lines to the camera now and then?
Sincerely,Your viewers

During what the New York Times called a "Winter from Hell," four blizzards dumped record amounts of snow on campus in the three weeks between January 27 and February 15. True to form, Harvard closed due to the inclement weather fewer times than other local universities. Harvard remained open on a number of days when it was unsafe or impossible for many employees to get to work. For example, the University was open on January 28, when Boston had a parking ban that wasn't lifted until 5 pm, Boston's public schools were closed, and plow drivers were reporting close calls with residents who were walking in the streets (due to sidewalks not being shoveled, etc.). WCVB reported a statement made by Gov. Charlie Baker '79 on January 27 that said “...Unless you have a reason to be out tonight or tomorrow after midnight, we would encourage you not to be."
Members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers were required to use vacation or personal days at times when they feared to report to work out of concern for their safety, for example on January 28. Parents faced particularly troubling choices when their children’s schools closed, yet they were expected to work their regular hours. One union member commented, “I’ve lost all my personal and vacation time. Now I have no extra time (not even sick time, because my kids were sick the week before the blizzard)... I don’t think I should lose my earned time because I have to make a decision about my safety and health..." Last year, a group of HUCTW members filed a grievance because they did not receive paid time off during a severe storm in February 2014, but were made to report to work or use vacation or other benefit time (the HUCTW contract says, “When a concern for safety makes travel inadvisable, a paid absence may be appropriate...”). Over a year later, that grievance remains largely unresolved, indicating that the HUCTW grievance process is not functioning effectively.
For security guards who work at Harvard, dual employees of the University and Securitas, and members of the Service Employees International Union, the situation has been even worse. Recently, when the University closed due to severe weather, guards who were scheduled to work report having gone unpaid. The past practice has been that when the University is closed due to inclement weather, and security guards are told not to work their scheduled shifts, they have still received their regular pay. This year, when the University closed on February 6, 9, and 10, at least some security guards went unpaid (the university also failed to pay security guards for work on January 2, after the Winter Recess was expanded to include that date). Guards have filed a union grievance over management’s failure to pay them what they’re owed; to date management has reportedly made no offer to resolve the grievance. Similarly, many campus workers who do not belong to labor unions have gone without pay when the University closed.
Dining Hall workers reported for duty even on days when the storms made it impossible to return to their homes for the night. Some dining Hall workers ended up sleeping on couches or mattresses on the floor, some even six to a room. Workers who were assigned hotel rooms weren’t always told they would be staying with another person, which made some uncomfortable. Workers report being issued taxi vouchers which were not always accepted (apparently one person walked to work in severe weather because of this). Some dining hall staff were told by managers to sign a list if they’d be willing to stay overnight in a hotel; but then after signing up were told there was no bed for them during one of the blizzards.
As the world’s richest university, with an endowment of roughly $36 billion, Harvard can afford to give its workers some paid time off during extreme, dangerous weather conditions, rather than expecting them to use up their vacation time, for example. Better accommodations for dining hall workers are certainly possible. To tell security guards not to report for their regular shifts when the University is closed, and then dock their pay, seems miserly and unfair.  President Drew Faust should use her considerable influence to award at least three additional personal days to members of HUCTW, and to confer a similar benefit on non-salaried workers who are not members of labor unions, and to pay SEIU members for all their regularly scheduled shifts when Havard has closed or will close due to inclement weather. Dining Hall workers who weren’t offered adequate accommodations during the blizzards should be compensated. Harvard can offer its employees, who work hard to make the institution function, more than a cold shoulder during emergency weather.
Geoffrey P. Carens is a representative of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and a delegate of the Industrial Workers of the World.

Imagine you’re a woman. It’s a Friday night, and you and your friends decide that the bass-bumping, adrenaline-pumping, mind-numbing atmosphere of the nightclub is the perfect catharsis from a workweek riddled with stress and anxiety.
You spend an hour getting ready. You put together an outfit in which you feel beautiful and confident. Before leaving, you slide into your most comfortable pair of heels to provide for maximum dancing stamina, and sling an extra hair tie around your wrist for the inevitable moment when the steam of the dance floor turns your hair into a untamed, frizzy mess. You feel excited, energetic, and empowered.
Now imagine that you’re inside the club and you’re dancing in a circle with your friends. Suddenly you feel a pair of sweaty hands grabbing you around your waist. Some man’s crotch is pressed up against your backside, gyrating to and fro. If you’re feeling generous, you brush him off with a polite “No thanks.” If not, you give a friend the signal to pull you away from his grasp and migrate to another corner of the room.
Then imagine that this happens a few more times. Perhaps it’s the same guy now attempting to “grind up” on one of your friends. Or maybe it’s a different man, and it takes him about three or four failed attempts at pressing himself against you to get the hint. Frustrated, you and your friends decide to trek over to the bar for a brief respite.
While at the bar, a man offers to buy you a drink. You accept the offer and make small talk with him for the next few minutes. When you realize the chemistry is lacking, you grab a friend and attempt to make your way back to the dance floor, but the man pulls you back: “Where are you going?” he says. Or maybe he doesn’t pull you back, but instead follows you onto the dance floor. Or maybe he spends the next fifteen minutes visibly trash-talking you to his friends for abandoning him after he spent money on your drink.
Finally, you’ve had enough. Feeling exhausted and a bit violated, you leave the club. As you wait outside for a taxi, a group of men across the street holler obscenities at you. After all, you have been spotted exiting a club in a tight skirt and heels. You must’ve been “asking for it.”
Most of us are familiar with the term “asking for it” as a backwards justification for non-consensual sex. More often that not, “asking for it” refers to the notion that a woman’s adornment of risqué clothing somehow indicates her sexual availability. But it’s also the case that a woman’s presence in certain sexually-charged spaces—like the nightclub—can be interpreted as a willingness to engage in intercourse.
The scenario I’ve outlined above has become painfully more familiar to me throughout the mere year and a half that I’ve been able to participate in the club scene. It’s important to note that this is not the experience of every woman who attends a club on a Friday or Saturday night, and it is in no way meant to demonize club-going males. Nevertheless, it is troublingly common for women to encounter the unique breed of sexual harassment that manifests on public dance floors across the globe.
Perhaps the best explanation for this kind of harassment is that the nightclub is an inherently misogynistic social sphere saturated with inherently misogynist expectations. This of course excludes places like queer nightclubs, which consciously attempt to defy these stereotypes. At a standard club, however, women expect men to buy them drinks, while men expect women to dole out sexual favors in return. In a similar vein, women expect men to initiate the first dance, while men assume that consent isn’t necessary. These sorts of gendered expectations make for an environment that is not only blatantly anti-feminist, but also unsafe for women who must now be constantly defensive and suspicious of male behavior.
Equally as problematic is the assumption that club-goers are “asking for” the kind of sexism that currently characterizes nightclubs. For many young people, myself included, nightclubs provide opportunities for lively social interactions—good music, good conversation, and dancing with friends. Unfortunately for us, the emotional and physical risks of attending these clubs has begun to tarnish their more appealing characteristics.
What we need now, then, is a change in how these social spaces operate, and in the many assumptions that float among the sweat and smoke hovering above the dance floor. Transforming the gender dynamics of the standard nightclub is no small feat—it will require transforming the larger climate of misogyny that still pervades our sexual and social interactions—but we must be prepared to meet that challenge. After all, what happens inside the club is a direct reflection of what’s acceptable outside of it.

Harvard recently announced that it would host freshman  formal on campus for the first time since 2007. This decision to use the Science Center Plaza as a venue, instead of a Boston-area hotel as in years past, has left some disappointed. And perhaps this year’s event will lack a degree of the same glamor or allure. However, we commend the College for this logistically smart choice and for the important opportunity for community building it will offer members of the freshman class at the conclusion of their first year.
Financially and organizationally, the decision to move formal makes a good deal of sense. Hosting the event on the Science Center Plaza will cost just $2,500 for the tent—“far, far less” than renting space in a hotel, according to Katherine W. Steele, the College’s director for freshman programming. The decision will also allow the College to forego the cost and inconvenience of shuttling students to and from the event. Additionally, members of the First-Year Social Committee said that having the formal on campus will allow for more flexibility in aspects of planning such as catering and decorations.
Even more significant than these logistical benefits is the opportunity for community building an on-campus formal affords. Hosting the event right beside the freshman dorms will ensure that all students are able to attend with minimum inconvenience, and will likely generate even greater attendance from last year’s record-high of 1200 tickets sold. Moreover, by hosting the formal closer to the end of the year, the event will serve as a memorable capstone to the Class of 2018’s formative freshman experience.
Despite all of these benefits, the fact that bad behavior from previous years was such an impetus for freshman formal’s return to campus is troubling. Steele said that she and other organizers “didn’t even try” looking into hotel venues, which have reservations about hosting events for college students due to past alcohol-related incidents. During last year’s freshman formal at the Seaport Boston Hotel, intoxicated students caused the event to end one hour early. With all the positive aspects of an on-campus formal, we hope that students party responsibly while enjoying themselves next month.
Ultimately, hosting freshman formal below an illuminated Annenberg Hall and alongside Harvard Yard will offer a distinct ambience that will prove more memorable for attendees than a hotel ballroom. On April 29, the Science Center Plaza has the potential to be the setting for a picturesque culmination of freshman year that many upperclassmen would have enjoyed. We hope the freshman class takes full advantage of the opportunity.

A new CVS, complete with 24-hour service and a pharmacy, opened at 6 JFK St. Sunday several days ahead of its projected April opening, expanding the presence of CVS in Harvard Square.
In response to the opening of the new 24-hour location, the existing CVS at 29 JFK Street plans to close, and the storefront at 1426 Mass. Ave., located a little more than 300 feet away from the new location, has reduced its hours, remaining open from 7 a.m. to midnight. The new location is now the only 24-hour CVS in the Square, according to an employee at the new location.
Bill Nazzaro, a manager at the new CVS, said that the location is fully functioning and open for business, aside from one “IT glitch” that has prevented some students from purchasing store items with Crimson Cash.
Additionally, the pharmacy that previously occupied the 1426 Mass. Ave. location has relocated to the new storefront, according to Nazzaro.
He added that “prescriptions are also moved and ready to go [at the 6 JFK St. location].”
Nazzaro said that the entire pharmacy staff has also moved from Mass. Ave. to the new location, allowing students to maintain relationships with familiar pharmacists.
Students praised the increased variety of products at the new store, which extends two stories and boasts more shelf space than the 29 JFK St. location did.
Ben A. F. Anandappa ’18 said that there were “many more options at the new location” than there were at the other two CVS stores in the Square.
Other students, however, noted that the new location lacks the self-checkout machines featured at the 1426 Mass. Ave. location.
“The lines [at the new CVS] are egregiously long because there’s no self check-out,” Madhav Y. Dhingra ’18 said.
Despite this lack of self-checkout machines, however, the new location has more than twice as many cashier-manned registers as the current Mass. Ave. location.

As it revisits major aspects of its curriculum in conjunction with its capital campaign, the Kennedy School of Government is in the early stages of creating a new “social enterprise incubator,” according to HKS spokesperson Doug Gavel.
The incubator, which is also referred to on the Kennedy School capital campaign website as a “social entrepreneurship lab,”  will provide financial, academic, and faculty resources for Kennedy School students launching social ventures. The project will be led on an interim basis by James L. Bildner, a senior research fellow at the Hauser Institute for Civil Society.
Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 differentiated the incubator from the Harvard Innovation Lab.
“The difference between this and what you see currently [in the i-lab] is this is a program designed to help people as they graduate—it provides resources for them to stick around for another six months, to get engaged, and so forth,” Ellwood said in February. “The idea is to take the lessons that we learn from the people that [do] social enterprises and...feed it back into the classroom.”
Roughly 3,800 students last year made use of the the i-lab, which also opened a “Launch Lab” this past summer dedicated to hosting 10 to 12 alumni ventures.
Matthew C. Guidarelli, i-lab assistant director for social and cultural entrepreneurship, said talks between the Kennedy School incubator and the i-lab on how the two organizations can collaborate have not moved beyond a preliminary conversation. He noted, however, that the “i-lab’s door is open as a collaborator and a thought partner” and pointed out that, with Ellwood sitting on the i-lab’s advisory board, the Kennedy School has a voice at the i-lab.
“More resources being made available is a good thing for all students, and for Harvard, and for supporting the entire entrepreneurial ecosystem that’s been burgeoning throughout this city and Boston,” Guidarelli said. Guidarelli added that he does not expect that the i-lab’s mission of helping students accelerate their ideas and their early-stage ventures would change as a response to the new incubator.
According to the Kennedy School’s website, it is currently searching for a new professor of social innovation, potentially on the tenure track, to “launch and lead a social innovation accelerator” and “participate in the leadership of the Hauser Institute for Civil Society.”
Harvard School of Public Health lecturer Gordon Bloom, who co-created the Social Entrepreneurship Collaboratory at Harvard, said the creation of a new Kennedy School-specific incubator was not surprising given that “traditionally Harvard has operated ‘every tub on its own bottom,’” but stressed the importance of continued multidisciplinary, university-wide collaborations like the i-lab.
Ellwood said a primary reason for the new incubator was that “students from around the University but particularly from the Kennedy School desperately would like to do more and have more support.”
Harvard Global Health Institute research fellow Livio Valenti, who co-founded vaccines company Vaxxes Technologies while a student at the Kennedy School, said that while he did not feel a “desperate” need for more resources to support social entrepreneurship, he did hope the new incubator could act more like a “lab” and help with the generation of sustainable project ideas.
“I think the thing that was really missing [when I started Vaxxes] was how to create a pipeline of people that generate social enterprises in sectors that are relevant,” Valenti said. “I think the desperate need is really how do you get to having that idea that is worth spending your time afterwards.”

Due to historically snowy weather conditions, local food pantries have dealt with transportation and distribution challenges this winter as they faced fewer deliveries and a smaller volunteer workforce, according to food pantry leadership.
During heavy snowfall, some pantries were forced to close temporarily and offered a more limited variety of food since weather conditions made moving supplies difficult or impossible for days at a time. In addition, area residents were less able to access pantries, even as demand remained high.
Food for Free, a Cambridge food rescue service that distributes surplus food to shelters and pantries and helps distribute supplies from the Greater Boston Food Bank, had to suspend operations on two days this winter, and snowy streets made moving their large delivery truck challenging, Sasha Purpura, its executive director, said.
Purpura said she was grateful for delivery drivers working in the harsh conditions.
“I just kept thanking them, because they were working so hard in miserable cold, snowy weather, but they were able to do it, even though it took longer and they had to be more careful,” she said.
One of the pantries affected by Food for Free’s reduced operations was Margaret Fuller Neighborhood House, a community center and food pantry in Central Square.
According to Annie Small, Operations Manager at MFNH, the pantry was unable to pick up any food from its supplier, the Greater Boston Food Bank in South Boston, during the last week of January and first two weeks of February.
“We had some food in storage, so the only thing we ran out of was perishables: bread, meat, vegetables. We were only able to give out dry foods,” Small said.
The closure of public transportation systems forced many pantries to operate with reduced staff or to close for the day.
“On days when there was simply no bus service, there was nothing we could do,” said Geoffrey M. Kotowski, Food Pantry Coordinator at Cambridge Citywide Senior Center.
Winter weather also made it difficult for local residents to pick up food from the pantries.
“We only serve seniors, and the weather has particularly affected them,” Kotowski said. “We’ve been giving out more food to people, but people are able to come much less often, sometimes maybe only once a month.”
Despite reduced access, the demand for food pantry services remained significant. Lost workdays, school cancellations that deprived children of free or subsidized lunches, and higher heating bills contributed to greater need this winter, said Nancy Jamison, Executive Director of local food rescue service Fair Foods Inc.
Purpura also noted the pressure for pantries to continue providing food despite the weather.
“The challenge with these particular storms were when the city shuts down [and] emergency food shuts down, it is the people who are most in need who are most affected,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the number of fraternities at the College continues to grow, a group of the unrecognized social organizations are finalizing a set of bylaws to form a interfraternity council that would coordinate event scheduling and further centralize their operations.
Over the last year, leaders of Harvard’s fraternities have discussed introducing an interfraternity council to campus. The negotiations come as the presence of Greek life at Harvard expands, recently with the reintroduction of Kappa Sigma fraternity last year and the October formation of a Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity “colony” on campus.
Various leaders from individual fraternities at the College would comprise the body, according to the most updated copy of its bylaws that Jimmie Hill ’18, the president of Harvard DKE, shared with The Crimson. The council would have six officers—a president, vice president, administrator, recruitment coordinator, events coordinator, and athletic coordinator—serving year-long terms. Member fraternities would rotate occupation of the president position, according to the bylaws, which are subject to change, according to Jason A. Solis ’16, the president of Harvard’s chapter of fraternity Sigma Chi.
At least two of Harvard’s fraternities, Sigma Chi and DKE, have formally approved the interfraternity council’s bylaws, according to Solis and Hill. Kappa Sigma and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, meanwhile, have yet to approve the bylaws, according to their respective presidents, Pieter J. Zenner ’17 and Henry J. Limitone ’16, who both praised the centralized body.
Daniel E. Silberwasser ’16, the president of Harvard’s chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi, declined to comment.
Solis said he hopes interested parties will formally establish the council by next semester.
Interfraternity councils exist on other campuses and are often advised by administrators. Solis said the organization at Harvard is an effort to unite the growing prominence of Greek life at the College.
“We see Greek life really expanding here on campus, and we felt that…this would be something that would help organization,” Solis said.
The interfraternity council, as described in the bylaws, would bring more regulation to how individual fraternities operate. The council’s recruitment coordinator would ensure that individual fraternity recruitment events do not overlap, and an athletic coordinator would organize intramural sports competitions among the fraternities.
Member fraternities would pay yet-to-be-determined dues based on the size of their individual memberships, Solis said. The officers would convene at least monthly, and a fraternity would face a $10 fine for every council meeting to which it did not send a representative, as stipulated in the bylaws.
Leaders of various fraternities on campus said the potential introduction of an interfraternity council would reduce scheduling conflicts and potentially increase their memberships. “It allows us to reach out to [many] more students, be much more visible,” Hill said.
The College does not recognize Greek organizations, meaning that unlike interfraternity councils at other schools, it is unlikely that administrators will be directly involved with the body.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich wrote in an email that “since the College doesn't recognize fraternities or sororities, we wouldn't institutionalize something like an inter-fraternity council.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council Student Initiatives Committee received 15 entries to its newly formed grant program rewarding student initiatives after it extended the submission deadline to Sunday night, according to the committee’s co-chairs Daniel V. Banks ’17 and Shaiba Rather ’17.
The program, called the Harvard Project, is a Council-wide effort to reward initiatives that bolster student life and was first discussed at the UC’s general meeting last week. The project will award $3,000 to the winning student initiative in order to help out with execution in its initial stages.
According to Banks and Rather, submissions include a student-run alternative kitchen, a sustainable laundry solution, and a program to help students connect over the summer. Generally, the submissions are mostly under the categories of improving mental health, sustainability, and inclusivity.
Legislation that passed last week endorsing the project outlined the terms of the project and encouraged students to find solutions to student life issues, saying that “to say Harvard is perfect would be to undermine our capacity and potential for change.”
“It's been really promising to see how willing student are to engage in their community,” Banks and Rather wrote in an email. “ The Student Initiatives Committee is thrilled to help tackle these matters alongside proactive students.”
Three out of the fifteen proposals will be chosen as finalists on April 7 and will participate in a Council-sponsored innovation fair from April 14 to April 17.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former University President Lawrence H. Summers and Jason L. Furman ‘92, the current chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, discussed domestic economic growth at a packed John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics Monday night.
Both men, who previously worked together as economic advisers in the Obama Administration, touched on concerns surrounding tepid growth in the U.S. economy overall, in addition to issues like income inequality, healthcare costs, and stagnant growth for the middle class.
Furman said that he was cautiously optimistic about economic trends, despite uncertainty in future innovations and forthcoming policy choices.
He ultimately expressed confidence in what he termed “exciting developments” in technology and a dramatic reduction in healthcare costs.
“All of those structural factors give me a decent amount of cause for optimism about the future,” he said.
Summers and Furman also discussed important challenges to U.S. economic growth. Growth requires “enabling more people to work, and to work more productively," Summers said.
The two said that income inequality was another difficulty. Specifically, Furman cited the fact that the share earned by the bottom 90 percent of the American income distribution fell from 68 percent in 1973 to around 50 percent in 2013.
Furman called the trend “a rather urgent public policy problem.” He suggested a more progressive tax system, expansion of international trade, raising the minimum wage, and increasing bargaining power for workers as solutions to help address rising inequality.
The pair also discussed the effect of other public policies on economic growth, referring to how immigration reform would change the demographics of the labor force.
“The workforce itself is not a demographic factor that is inscribed in stone. It depends on our choices,” Furman said. “And one of the most important choices it depends on is immigration reform.”
Furman pointed out the economic impetus for immigration reform, saying that one of the main factors for slowing growth compared to the 1980’s is present day decline of the prime working-age population.
Summers also pointed to a trend in which Harvard students have seemed to turn towards working at NGOs and nonprofits in the private sector instead of the government in the public sector as outlets for their idealism.
However, Furman, who holds three degrees from Harvard, emphasized the continued value of public institutions. As an example of the larger impact public policy can have, he cited his work on expanding the Earned Income Tax Program, which he said now benefits an additional 10 million individuals per year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators will meet with the Cambridge Historical Commission on Thursday to seek approval for proposed renovations to the Smith Campus Center.
The campus center will undergo construction beginning in spring 2016 and finish in 2018. In late January and early February, Tanya Iatridis, the senior director of University planning who oversees the renovation, showed off preliminary blueprints and plans to Harvard affiliates.
The four sides of the campus center—Massachusetts Avenue and Mt. Auburn, Dunster, and Holyoke Streets—will feature renovations that primarily add more trees and public seating space. The first, second, and tenth floor will also be renovated.
The first floor of the new campus center will feature a welcome area for visitors, the Information Desk, common spaces, walls with moss and ferns, and trees. The plans that have been submitted to the Historical Commission detail a two level cafe and more food options available on the first floor than the campus center current has but do not go into specifics about which food retailers may occupy the designated spaces.
The second floor will house more common spaces and meeting rooms and the arts and wellness center, which is currently housed on the first floor.
The tenth floor will also include meeting and event spaces, as well as a “projecting bay”, or a room with a glass wall, according to the plans.
The plans, available on the Historical Commission's website, detailed a deteriorated image of the current center, with concrete surfaces stained “in visually distracting patterns by airborne exhaust,” cracked and damaged concrete, and corrosion. All of the buildings outside concrete will be cleaned and sealed with a water repellant, according to the plans.
The plans did not detail specific uses of common and meeting spaces, but Iatridis has previously told The Crimson that some space on the second floor will be dedicated to Undergraduate Council and Graduate Student Government offices.
Some undergraduates have criticized the proposed campus center because of its perceived lack of dedicated social spaces for undergraduates. At last week’s UC open forum,  University President Drew G. Faust said that she expects primarily undergraduates to occupy the campus center at night, while other Harvard affiliates will likely use it during the morning and day hours.

A group of Harvard students have joined together to launch an arts and advocacy magazine to focus on issues of diversity and identity among students of color at Harvard, called Renegade, which will debut online on Friday.
The group—which is composed of visual artists, musicians, writers, and podcast makers, according to Renegade member and spokesperson Andrea Ortiz ’16—started a social media campaign publicizing the upcoming launch of the publication through Facebook and other platforms on Sunday.
The magazine’s Facebook page describes the group as “an art and advocacy collective of Harvard student artists, writers, musicians, poets, activists, and thinkers who have come together in solidarity as people of color.” The Facebook page also links to several Web platforms to showcase the group’s work, including its website, a SoundCloud profile, Twitter feed, and Tumblr.
Individual students have also changed their Facebook profile pictures and cover photos publicizing the publication. The magazine’s official Facebook page is highlighting individual members leading up to its launch.
According to Ortiz, the group was founded after a brainstorming session between a group of students in February. It will be launching its Web page on Friday and will remain based online for the time being, according to Ortiz, who described the project as a “forum where people of color can express themselves through any artistic and creative medium” in an email.
“In our writing circle, we have received a lot of essays, columns, and creative writing,” Ortiz wrote. “Overall what we feature depends heavily on what our contributors bring to the table out of their own creativity.”
Through its social media campaign publicizing the launch, the group has created a video which includes anonymous statements, many of which relate to issues of race and diversity on campus and express frustration.
“[P]eople dress up as my ethnicity on halloween,” one quote in the video says. Other statements in the video include “‘diversity’ is not just a buzzword” and “this campus was built by slaves.”
The video defines the group’s namesake, renegade, as “someone or something that causes trouble and cannot be controlled.”
The group has also made a Tumblr page titled Crimson Catharsis to serve as an online forum for discussions about identity and diversity on campus, according to a description on the blog. Posts on the page are anonymous and are not affiliated with Renegade, according to blog description, and by Monday evening the Tumblr included roughly 20 posts addressing a range of issues and institutions on campus, including Harvard University Health Services and The Crimson’s editorial board.
According to Ortiz, the group has so far received positive feedback. “Our launch has also started up many meaningful conversations about race with people from different corners of campus,” she wrote.
Multiple students who are involved in the publication declined to comment on the project before its Friday launch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust is defending Harvard’s governance structure after two Harvard Law School professors were sharply critical of the central administration in an op-ed that called for the formation of a faculty senate.
In an interview last week, Faust stood behind Harvard’s current structure, maintaining that the institution’s procedures and decision-making processes duly include representatives from across the University.
In particular, Faust said that while a faculty senate has been proposed, she is not convinced one would work at Harvard.
“I don't personally think that it's particularly well-suited for Harvard because so many decisions are made at the school level and our structures have always organized themselves around that,” Faust said. “I've not heard a drumbeat over the years for such a move here at Harvard. I think...the [Faculty of Arts and Sciences] meeting is regarded by many in FAS as kind of sacrosanct and the place where these interactions happen.”
Faust was responding directly to an op-ed published last week in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Law School professors Charles Fried and Robert H. Mnookin, who argued that Harvard’s central administration and “bureaucracy” had grown extensively. “And the results have not always been good,” it read. The authors also suggested that observers should not assume that the FAS, whose monthly meetings are chaired by Faust, speaks for the whole University.
Fried and Mnookin pointed in particular to the unveiling of Harvard’s University-wide sexual assault policy and procedures last July and the new health benefits plans for non-union employees last fall as examples of decisions that they argued did not involve enough faculty input. But Faust took issue with each of those examples, maintaining that broad input from across Harvard was sought.
"The deans of all the faculties were very involved in discussions throughout the development of [the sexual assault] policy, so it's not that I sat here in my office and just announced these things were going to happen,” Faust said in the interview, which was also attended by her spokesperson, Jeff Neal.
For much of her tenure, Faust has emphasized her "One Harvard" vision—a push to create a more unified institution—which has grown steadily with initiatives from cross-school programs to the first University-wide fundraising drive.
Increasing centralization has faced criticism before at Harvard, which for much of its history has been a relatively decentralized institution. After the 2012 Government 1310 cheating scandal and the revelation that administrators had searched the emails of College resident deans, faculty raised governance concerns over a perceived lack of faculty voice in University decisions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 33 Harvard men’s tennis team has a long road ahead of it as the squad seeks to reclaim the Ivy League crown, which it relinquished to Columbia last season after capturing the championship the previous two seasons.
But fortunately for the Crimson (14-5), it has a strong foundation of underclassmen on its side— led by sophomore Brian Yeung and freshman Grant Solomon—who helped carry the team to victory in its matches on Saturday.
In Harvard’s final nonconference matchups before it dives into Ancient Eight play this weekend against Cornell and the defending-champion Lions, it dominated Buffalo and Amherst by scores of 6-1 and 7-0, respectively.
Playing against nonconference opponents gives the Crimson the opportunity to showcase its depth, and Solomon and other freshmen seized the chance to shine.
“On a tennis team, you’ve got one set lineup,” said Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72, referring to the underclassmen. “But matches like these allow us to show a lot more talent. We’ve scheduled three or four doubleheaders this season specifically so people can test out their play and understand how much better they’re getting. I think that’s a great way to develop.”
On Saturday, Solomon was the only Harvard player to compete in singles in both contests, winning two matches without dropping a set. The Dallas native posted a 6-3, 6-4 victory in sixth singles against the Bulls, before moving up to third singles and helping the Crimson make quick work of last year’s Division III national champion Lord Jeffs, cruising to a 6-2, 6-3 win.
Meanwhile, Yeung and co-captain Denis Nguyen, ranked 15th among doubles pairs nationally, downed their Buffalo opponents, 6-2, in the first match. Against Amherst, Yeung teamed with freshman Kenny Tao and won, 6-1, on the first court, and also contributed a three-set victory at No. 1 singles.
“In singles [against Amherst], I started off really strong, holding a lot of deuce points and breaking my opponent’s serve,” Yeung said. “In the second, I let my guard down and lost a couple close games. But I managed to regroup in the third and fought hard to finish the whole match.”
One reason for Harvard’s success in the early portion of its season is the emergence of Yeung and his ability not only to contribute in the singles lineup, but also in teaming with Nguyen at first doubles.
The Hong Kong native has stepped in seamlessly to replace the departed Casey MacMaster ’14. Nguyen and MacMaster were ranked as highly as sixth in the nation last season, but Yeung and Nguyen have already proven a formidable pair, placing 15th in the most recent poll.
“Denis has a strong return game, high-percentage volley game, and a big serve, so we hit it off really well and had a good tournament at regionals,” Yeung explained. “Our abilities complement each other, and his volley game helps us hold a lot of serves because he’s really good at the net.”
Similarly, Solomon, along with fellow freshmen Tao Jean Thirouin and Xavier Gonzalez, have provided a boost of energy for the squad.
“The freshmen have great energy and are really, really well liked by the upperclassmen,” Fish said. "They are getting better all the time…. Our team is a very big one so they may not be getting quite the level of experience as they could be on a midrange Ivy, but their attitudes have been terrific.”
And heading into the all-important Ivy season, the young guns will play an important role and be forced to step up their games.
“Columbia doesn’t know about are secret weapons—our freshman class,” Yeung said. “Heading into Ivy season, they have to take up the pressure of playing conference matches. Our Ivy standing depends on every single game, and they’ll be a key determinant in how our conference games will go…. This weekend was great to get freshman sophomores some good practice and matches.”
This year’s Ivy League is a stacked conference, with three teams ranked in the top 35 and three more among the top 60, headlined by No. 26 Columbia.
Harvard will attempt to get off to a fast start when it takes on the Lions and the No. 46 Big Red this weekend.
“It’s just impossible to predict what’s going to happen,” Fish said. “Everyone is good, and if a team manages to get you one weekend they’ll face another barrage the next weekend. It’s kind of up for grabs, and you have to give the nod to Columbia because they’ve performed great all year. But every team is great in fits, ourselves included.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard baseball team traveled to New York and Philadelphia to open its Ivy League slate with Columbia and Penn on Sunday and Monday. The team returned to Cambridge with as many conference wins as it had when it originally set out on the trip.
The Lions and Quakers, whom are considered by many as the favorites for the Ivy League title, swept the Crimson in each of its two-game series. Harvard (10-12, 0-4 Ivy) lost the four games by a total of five runs, with three of the four losses coming on walk-off singles. The Lions (11-10, 3-1) and Quakers (7-9, 3-1) outscored the Crimson by 18 runs last season.
“Losing three out of four games on walk-offs is tough,” freshman utilityman Matt Rothenberg said. “It can be deflating, so I think the biggest challenge right now is keeping morale high, keeping people ready to go for the long haul.”
PENN 4, HARVARD 3
With the game tied 3-3 in the bottom of the ninth, Penn outfielder Gary Tesch singled to left field, allowing Matt McKinnon to score on an error by leftfielder Matt Sanders to hand the Crimson its third walk-off loss in four games. It was the third error of the day for Harvard and the team’s eighth on the weekend.
“I think it’s always an adjustment coming back up North, but we definitely need to tighten that up going into next weekend against Princeton and Cornell,” senior Jake McGuiggan said.
With Harvard trailing by one and down to its last out, captain Ethan Ferreira singled home McGuiggan to force the Quakers to bat in the botom of the ninth.
Harvard junior Sean Poppen got the start for the Crimson, throwing six and a third solid innings, allowing three runs (one earned) on five hits while striking out eight.
PENN 2, HARVARD 1
In Monday’s first game, it was senior Connor Betbeze driving in junior Ryan Mincher in the bottom of the ninth to secure a walk-off victory for the hosts. In the decisive final frame, Crimson junior pitcher T.J. Laurisch loaded up the bases with just one out.
Starter Tanner Anderson allowed just one run and six hits in seven innings of work for Harvard. However, it was Quakers starter Ronnie Glenn who stole the spotlight on the mound. The senior threw a complete game and surrendered just one run to pick up his first win of the season. The Crimson’s only tally came in the top of the first inning, when Ferreira singled home Martin.
COLUMBIA 9, HARVARD 7 (F/8)
In a game that was called in the bottom of the eighth inning due to darkness, two Columbia homeruns proved to be the difference as the Lions were able to pick up a win against Harvard. Lions rightfielder Gus Craig took Harvard starter Matt Timoney yard in the third to give the hosts a 4-1 lead.
The Crimson scored the game’s next six runs after stringing together eight hits in the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings.
But Columbia roared back in the bottom of the sixth, tagging freshman Dylan Combs for four runs (three earned) to take a lead it would not relinquish.
Lions righty Harrison Egly slammed the door on the Harvard offense in his two-and-a-third innings to pick up the win. Joe Falcone’s four-bagger in the eighth culminated a four-hit, three-RBI day for the Lions cleanup hitter.
“Columbia is a great program,” McGuiggan said. “They’re well-coached and they’ve got a lot of disciplined hitters on their team and pitchers that execute really well. Obviously we would have wanted to win those games, but, at the same time, we know that we played the two-time defending Ivy League champion extremely well.”
COLUMBIA 5, HARVARD 4 (F/7)
Columbia pinch-hitter John Kinne delivered the game-winning hit in the first game of Sunday’s doubleheader, driving in third baseman David Vandercook to lead Columbia to its first win of its sweep of Harvard. The junior ripped a single into leftfield with two outs in the seventh to give the Lions the victory.
Harvard was able to chip away at a 4-2 Lions lead with runs in the sixth and seventh innings but walks to Columbia's Vandercook and Randell Kanemaru by Harvard junior Sean O’Neill set the table for Kinne’s heroics.
Sophomore lefty Nick Gruener got the start for the Crimson, surrendering four earned runs to a Columbia offense that finished the game with 12 hits. McGuiggan paced the Harvard offense, picking up three hits including two doubles and driving in a run.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team took fifth place in the Seahawk Intercollegiate Tournament hosted by University of North Carolina Wilmington to open up the spring slate of competition for the Crimson.
The pool of fourteen teams included Ivy League contender Columbia, who ended the weekend with an eighth-place finish.
“We were coming off a week of practicing indoors after spring break,” captain Akash Mirchandani said. “All things considered I think the guys played really well. There is room for improvement, but the tournament was productive. Everyone seems to be moving in the right direction.”
Freshman Greg Royston came out of the tournament tied for ninth with a total score of 222 to lead Harvard. Sophomore Kendrick Vinar opened with a first round one-under-par score of 69 in his home state of N.C. to notch the lowest score posted in the opening round. Vinar would fall back to finish 28th after completing the next two rounds.
In individual scoring, Georgia’s Lee McCoy and Virginia Commonwealth’s Adam Ball tied for first place with an even-par score of 216. Campbell emerged as the overall tournament winner, shooting a combined 16 strokes over par. The Bulldogs finished only five strokes behind the Fighting Camels.
“I view this weekend as a success,” coach Kevin Rhoads said. “And a good step on our progression that we need to follow through the spring. I was very happy with the outcome of the results, but even happier on the first day of how our focus was on the right things and how our games were holding up, despite not being outdoors [in practice].”
Two of the Crimson’s other three competitors—junior Rohan Ramnath and Mirchandani—finished in the top 50. Ramnath shot a strong performance of one-under par in the second round on Sunday afternoon, which put him as a 39th-place finisher.
“We finished the fall semester very strongly,” Rhoads said. “It took a little while to get going in the fall season, and we’re starting this spring season at a much higher place. The main thing is that we have to keep on staying patient, and staying really smart on what we’re doing in each of our rounds. If we can do that, I’ll be very pleased with what we do in the spring.”
The inclement weather conditions this weekend threw a wrinkle into the three-round tournament. Below-freezing temperatures highlighted the first round of play, while powerful gusts of wind were prevalent in the ultimate 18 holes.
The Crimson has not been able to train outdoors often because of the incessant cold weather in the Greater Boston area, and found it difficult to prepare for weather obstacles the team could not simulate during its indoor practices. While the players try to find time to spend on golf courses, many of the courses within a five-hour radius of Harvard’s campus are currently closed.
“In general, our games are very close and just require more outdoor repetitions so that we all are hitting shots,” Mirchandani said. “Like today, [Monday], for example, it was very windy and you need to be used to visualizing shots and dealing with different obstacles, and I think we’re just trying to get used to that aspect again.”
The Crimson ended the first round of the tournament in first place, and fell spots each subsequent round. While the Crimson finished in ourth-to-last-place in is final round, Harvard did enough in the first two rounds to place in the top five.
“The score we shot today was not great," Rhoads said. "But the overall take away from the weekend was very positive. There are certain things that you cannot simulate indoors, and we were playing against a bunch of schools that do come down [to North Carolina] to play all the time. Our guys are in a really good place. I just hope that weather conditions and course practice allows us to show just how good we are.”

1. Who are the students dressed in neon orange standing outside Mass. Hall? Are they pubbing a rave? 
No rave here—the students are members of Divest Harvard, a group of students, faculty, and alumni demanding that the University to divest its $35.9 billion endowment from fossil fuels. The 3-year-old advocacy group has staged numerous protests, including a sit-in blocking the entrance of Mass. Hall—the building that houses University President Drew G. Faust’s office—to stop administrators from coming in the building, a 24-hour occupation inside Mass. Hall, and other demonstrations and teach-ins. Neon orange is the group’s signature color.
2. I still don’t really get what divestment is—what would it mean for Harvard?
If Harvard divests from fossil fuels, it would begin the process of selling its investment shares in companies that profit from fossil fuels, such as Exxon Mobil. The action of divestment is intended to both weaken the company by pulling money out and to make a social statement about the unethicality of investment in a company or industry.
There is some Harvard precedent to divestment. Harvard divested its endowment from South African companies during the apartheid in 1978 and from tobacco companies in 1990.
Further, divestment is trendy—there has been a larger collective movement on college campuses across the nation advocating that institutions divest from fossil fuels; for example, Stanford divested from coal last year.
3. So, is President Faust buying it?
Faust has repeatedly argued against divestment. As head the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body that makes that makes all investment decisions, she has several justifications for her stance. While recognizing that climate change does pose a problem, Faust argues that divestment would politicize the endowment, potentially weakening its investment returns. She has also said that Harvard holds relatively few shares in any company, so divestment would not significantly impact the fossil fuel industry and would instead reduce Harvard’s influence over the companies. She has added that Harvard will continue to focus its efforts on education about the issue, sustainability initiatives, and research that will create solutions to climate change.
4. Does Divest Harvard do anything besides protesting? 
Yes—they are currently trying to sue the University for its investment in fossil fuels. Seven students filed a lawsuit claiming that Harvard’s investment in fossil fuels violates its charitable duties and that the University is misallocating its funds by investing in “abnormally dangerous activities,” alleging that the negative environmental effects of climate change cause harm to students. Harvard responded by filing motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which were recently confirmed by a judge. Undeterred, Divest has said they are working to appeal the lawsuit.
5. They sound persistent—what’s next for Divest Harvard?
They say they will not stop until Havard agrees to divest from all fossil fuel investments. Divest members are planning a weeklong sit-in protest around Mass. Hall called “Harvard Heat Week” from April 13 to 18. The week will also include teach-in and acts of civil disobedience. The movement has already garnered support from students, faculty, staff, and notable alumni, including Natalie Portman and Cornel West.

Although far more brilliant Crimson articles have been written about this momentous occasion in the past, today, Tuesday, March 31st, 2015, is forcasted to be a clear-skied, sunny day with temperatures reaching as high as 50 degrees. It is also a day that many high school seniors have been anxiously anticipating for months, as Harvard releases its admissions decisions for the Class of 2019. Previous years’ acceptances have elicited vomiting (this was fake), screaming, crying, even a shrug after being accepted to all the Ivies (we haven’t forgotten your mistake, Kwasi Enin).
For high school seniors, admissions decisions will be released through an admission portal after they receive an email that decisions have been posted. A record number of students applied through the Early Action program with 977 acceptances, and it is not known the exact number of students that will be accepted in the regular admission cycle. The Class of 2018 has approximately 1600 students. In the past, admitted students have been linked to a separate website with a video of Mark Zuckerberg welcoming them into the college, along with a host of materials about the freshman welcome weekend, Visitas, and visiting the school.
For desperate students waiting for results today, we are sorry that Flyby cannot offer more #insidertips. We wish you the best of luck and hope that you’ll be smart enough to choose Harvard out of all of your options! For Harvard students, WAKE UP FROM YOUR LAMONT DAZE! The kid who helped you on your lab reports when you idiotically decided to take five APs your senior spring is about to join YOU! For those lucky enough to have applied and been accepted in the early pool, today will be a day where you watch as your new fellow classmates gleefully flood onto the Class of 2019 Facebook page with posts like, “I have been accepted into Stanford, Yale, and Harvard. What should I do?!” while you roll your eyes because you’re an early kid and you already know what the right decision is. No matter who you are, today is a day that matters. Good luck, we’re cheering for you!

You have to be living under a rock to have not seen the flyers on campus about the new college dating app Batabing. The app is like Tinder, but not nearly as cool (not saying that Tinder is cool).
Batabing is a hyperlocal social app that matches people up. Users are required to sign up with a university email address. When you open up the app, you answer questions such as “What is your favorite hangout spot” and “Fun fact about me,” and then specify whether you’re looking for a love interest, or just a friend. From there, you swipe yes or no for other individuals.
There’s another phone app called Badabing, which is even more cringe-worthy. According to the app’s description on the Apple Store, Badabing is “the summer fashion app that helps you find swimwear ideas from your friends.” In other words, for a fee of $1.99, you sign in with your Facebook and an algorithm collects all of your friends’ bikini pictures. You can even save these pictures for later!
I have a few questions. How did the developers of Batabing choose this name? Did they not search their own application? Funny enough, if you Google “Batabing,” you are redirected to the cringe-worthy app Badabing. I tried to ask the developers of Batabing for a comment, but I could not reach them.

Last Friday night, five of Harvard College’s talented student bands battled it out for the honor of opening up for this year’s Yardfest artist, Jessie J. The bands—Black Tie Affair, Xkaban Jones and Dorian Grusoe, the Instrinics, the Solars, and Bared Grillz—filled the Cambridge Queen’s Head Pub with ’90s alternative rock , the rhythm of soul and R&B, and the primal beats of “wilderness rap.” When the smoke finally cleared, Black Tie Affair and the Instrinics were victorious. With the energy levels of the pub overflowing, several people were eager to answer this Roving Reporter’s questions.
Samir S. Faza ’15, audience member
Roving Reporter: Have you ever been to Battle for Yardfest before?
Samir: Negativo! I figured I’d saved the best for senior year, and it’s always a pleasure to see our wonderful campus bar at full capacity beyond those unbeatable Wednesday wing nights.
RR: So what’s your favorite thing you’ve seen so far?
Samir: At Battle for Yardfest? The bands of course! Our campus is sprawling with unrecognized talent.
Dayne A. Davis ’16, audience member
RR: Have you ever been to Battle for Yardfest before?
Dayne: No, I haven’t.
RR: Why did you come out this time?
Dayne: I have a couple of friends who like the Intrinsics a lot, so I came out with them. I saw some of their YouTube videos, and they’re really good. I also enjoy listening to music and going to live concerts. I like brass instruments, too.
RR: Great! What kind of music are you into?
Dayne: Rock. I like a lot of ’90s rock band music.
RR: So you enjoyed the Black Tie Affair, I assume?
Dayne: Of course! I thought they were awesome!
Pranav Krishnan ’16, Black Tie Affair (guitarist)
Roving Reporter: How do you feel about Jessie J being this year’s Yardfest artist?
Pranav: I’m pumped for it. She’s a big name, so it’s really surprising that we got her. I only know two songs by her, “Domino” and “Bang Bang,” but they are very catchy.
RR: Do you have a favorite ’90s rock band?
Pranav: I would have to go with Guns and Roses, followed by John Mayer.
RR: John Mayer plays a lot of other music genres besides rock, like country and blues.
Pranav: Yes, but I admire him because he’s so good at guitar.
Vibav H. Mouli ’16, Black Tie Affair (vocals)
RR: Do you guys have any interesting quirks as a band?
Vibav: Funny you should ask that. I don’t know if you remember the TV show “Rocket Power.” It’s with the kids who love to skateboard. We love to watch “Rocket Power” together, and instead of doing handshakes for greetings, we do the “Woogity! Woogity! Woogity!” from “Rocket Power.” We also say “Let’s get weird” a lot and drink a lot of orange juice. That’s our kind of thing.
John B. Tournas ’16, the Intrinsics (Alto and Bari Sax player)
RR: Do you guys have any interesting quirks as a band?
John: I don’t know if we do anything quirky, but one interesting fact about us is that we all love D'Angelo. Besides that, we all love to get people [to] dance.
RR: Do you guys ever get nervous performing in front of such a large crowd?
John: I’m never really nervous. I played in enough gigs, and mess-ups happen. But there is no reason to be scared about them. They just happen and you play through them.
RR: How would you describe the music you guys play?
John: We mostly do soul music as well as classic ’60s with modern R&B, originals, and covers.
RR: Do you have a favorite soul musician?
John: Al Green…and D'Angelo.
