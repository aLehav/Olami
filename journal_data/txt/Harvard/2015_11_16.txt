After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though progress has been made towards improving the undergraduate social experience over the past twelve months, the College still has many challenges for the coming year. The discourse surrounding final clubs has taken off, moving two clubs to go co-ed and prompting larger discussion about campus social spaces. The development of new University-wide Title IX policies and the troubling results of the University survey have pointed to the need for better sexual assault prevention and procedures on campus. And increasing resources have been put towards confronting the mental health problems still widespread throughout campus.
Each of the three tickets running to be president and vice president of the Undergraduate Council—Shaiba Rather ’17 and Danny V. Banks ’17; William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris ’17; Nick E. Gajdzik ’17 and Jeffrey M. Ott ’17—has proposed ways of tackling these issues. We believe that one ticket in particular stands best prepared for the job. We endorse Rather and Banks to take on these challenges in leading the UC for the next year; we believe that they have the necessary experience and vision to succeed in improving our campus.
Together, Rather and Banks, as the current co-chairs of the UC’s Student Initiative Committee respectively, have spearheaded several major projects intended to foster more inclusive social spaces, including this fall’s [BLANK] Party in the Science Center Plaza and the College-wide Halloween party in Annenberg. Banks also planned last March’s Oasis event in the Science Center. These experiences, combined with their terms serving as their house representatives, prepare Rather and Banks to work with the administration on behalf of the undergraduate population.
Moreover, beyond their experience, Rather and Banks present a compelling platform, centered on their catchphrase “Open Harvard.” Their plans aim to open the College’s social spaces by repurposing certain UC funds towards inclusive, collaborative parties, pushing for final clubs to hold open punch and regular open parties, and revamping the Yard to provide a better social scene for freshmen. Perhaps most importantly, they emphasize opening dialogue between students and administrators on a wide range of issues including sexual assault and mental health. Each of these items represents a piece of their vision for a more open and welcome campus.
It is encouraging to see all three UC tickets coalesce around the core issues of social spaces, mental health, and sexual assault. The fact that each ticket attempts to address these topics in their platforms is indicative of their importance to Harvard undergraduates; it is clear that the UC, regardless of leadership, must tackle these issues head-on in the coming year. In addition, the issues facing the College’s varsity athletes and the solutions suggested by Gajdzik and Ott should also be considered seriously by the UC, especially since extending dining hall hours and improving class scheduling to minimize conflicts would be beneficial to other students, as well.
In short, the three tickets all offer valuable insights into the problems facing Harvard undergraduates; each would serve the student body well. Due to their experience on the UC, we believe that Rather and Banks would be the most effective student advocates towards the administration. Their “Open Harvard” plan, incorporating practical and innovative platforms, is the best bet to lead the UC and the College forward.

The Undergraduate Council will submit the following referendum question to the UC presidential ballot: Should the Pusey Library "be transformed into a freshmen-oriented social space"?
While the UC-backed referendum question has been negatively received by many on campus, this proposal, and the project it represents, is a critical step in the direction of discussing Harvard’s problematic social climate and lack of inclusivity.
The Pusey Library project aims to achieve three goals. The first is the creation of an alternative social space to combat Harvard’s one-dimensional social scene. Students’ social lives are often limited to the same kinds of alcohol-centered, late-night parties in frats, final clubs, or upperclassmen houses every weekend, but Harvard’s student body is incredibly diverse. Many students have desires for alternative social gatherings, and we must give those students a space. The Pusey Library could become a daytime and evening gathering space, where students in the Yard could go to relax, enjoy each other’s company, and connect with the larger student community. Harvard’s social life must be opened up to a larger variety of students, and the Pusey Library proposal will enable us to do that.
Our second goal is to create a centralized location for freshmen to congregate and connect. Such a place simply doesn’t exist right now. Dorm common rooms are small and limit interaction to students who live nearby; they (obviously) cannot accommodate the entire freshmen student body. The Pusey Library, on the other hand, is centrally located and equally accessible to the entire freshmen class. Even the Union Dorms would be as connected to the social scene as the other dorms. Class community is critical to students’ well-being, and as of now, the lack of social spaces severely limits that.
Our last goal is arguably the most important. We want to create a venue for safe, inclusive, large-scale events oriented towards freshmen, with an emphasis on safe and inclusive, because our current social climate is neither. The upsetting results of the sexual assault survey are proof enough. As we now stand, freshmen are being driven to dorm parties, frats, and final clubs. These are the places where dangerous drinking happens, sexual assault happens, exclusion happens. This is unacceptable. Members of the student government have a mandate to ensure that students feel safe, welcome, and wanted. We aim to create a space where freshmen, who are at a special risk in this dangerous social climate, feel at ease and out of danger, and can still have a good time. Pusey Library is that space.
Our opposition has numerous issues with our project. One complaint is that the project is unfeasible. We disagree. We've spoken about this with members of the administration and the UC who support this initiative. We are not alone. We are equipped with the resources and allies to make this possible. We are equipped with the resources and allies to make this possible.
Another criticism is that the Pusey Library is an important academic space, and should not be dismantled. The argument is that, as a school, Harvard should seek to protect and foster its students’ academic resources, rather than expand social spaces. While it is true that academic enrichment is important, we argue that as a liberal arts college, Harvard also has an obligation to foster its students’ personal and communal growth beyond academics. Cultivating our enrichment as social and communal creatures is a critical part of a holistic education.
A third criticism is that the alcohol-free policy of the Yard would detract from student support of a social space located there. In response, we point to the success of events like the [Blank] Party, Camp Harvard, and, most recently, the Haunted Hall, all alcohol free and located in the Yard. As mentioned before, there is a large portion of the student body that does not require or want alcohol to enjoy itself. We want to cater to them, rather than ignore them.
A final criticism is that this referendum somehow trivializes and detracts from the serious issue of inclusiveness and social spaces on campus. While we recognize the merit of other criticisms, we fail to see how our attempt to create a freshman-focused space in which safe, inclusive, and enjoyable social events can be held in any way trivializes and detracts from the larger problem.
When students submit their vote for UC president, they will see this referendum question. We urge each and every student to vote in favor. It is time to take action, to take real strides in fixing Harvard’s broken social climate. While converting the Pusey Library may not be the end of the problem, it is certainly the beginning of the solution.

“But what about us?
We’ll always have Paris.” —Casablanca, 1942
The thing about death tolls is that they always seem to rise. At 40, you’d think it would stop. At 65, you’d think there’s not enough blood in the veins of Paris to quench the thirst of the jihadi. And at 129, you realize, thankfully, that you were wrong—that death tolls can indeed stop rising, and like good things, all bad things come to an end, too.
At 129, you also realize 129 lit candles can’t lift even the City of Lights from its darkest hour. Thankfully, Francois Hollande has a different response than vigils in mind: war, “pitiless” war. But leave it to the Pope to both correct the French and ignore the Church’s own history of violent zealotry in just one official statement, in which he reminded us that this is a “piecemeal” war we’ve actually been fighting for a while now.
It’s a war jihadists wage today, and other religious fundamentalists have for many yesterdays; yet despite its great span, we’re still hesitant to defend against it because until last Friday, it hadn’t quite hit home. It’s a war against France only insofar as the French historically epitomize something larger than themselves—a licentious Western spirit, a winsome disregard for institution, a near-peerless appetite for liberty. Didn't you know that the French have more poodles, more wine, and more sex than any other people? My only other guess would have been the Americans.
And there’s the rub. There’s the reason we don’t merely say “We are all French,” but actually feel it--it’s less because of our nations’ historic bond, or of poignant reminders of how France stood by us when jihadists spilled American blood barely a decade ago, and more because of this likeness in spirit, and thus likeness of victimhood. We mourn because of the fear that I’m sure we all felt this weekend, that Paris could be weeping for Los Angeles, Chicago, or Boston tomorrow.
For what it’s worth, this fear that the United States may be next is arguably a lot more visceral after Paris than after the similarly horrific attacks this weekend in culturally and geographically distant Beirut and Baghdad. Those who twist this reality to cry of moral favoritism against the outpouring of solidarity with France as opposed to browner countries like Lebanon and Iraq seem to base their argument on the risibly opportunistic, wholly inappropriate speculation that somehow Americans value French lives more than Middle Eastern ones.
But don’t they realize that we’re mourning more than just lives? Don’t they realize that the jihadis didn’t attack a government building, but rather a theater, a soccer stadium, and a restaurant? Don’t they realize that Paris is for lovers?
Lovers of each other, yes, but also lovers of liberty and modernity. Perhaps the most important article in the aftermath of these attacks on Paris was Jeffrey Goldberg’s list in “The Atlantic” of some of the things that militant Islamists are specifically fighting against. They’re fighting against people going to school in Peshawar and people publishing bibles in Istanbul; against people drinking coffee in Mumbai and people going to work in New York; against people shopping in Nairobi and people watching the marathon in Boston. They’re fighting against both the students at Yale and Mizzou who have the nerve to speak their mind and the critics who have the nerve to tell them to grow up.
The absurdity of this list reminds us how lucky we are to be born in a time and place in human history where the most remarkable of freedoms can be quotidian. And the aftermath of tragedies reminds us how beautifully unshakable our resolve is to defend them. Pace the jihadis, we’ll always have gaudy plays, soccer matches, and boozy dinners. We’ll always have Paris.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
[Summer]
Dear Friend,
I must admit that I am envious of your shadow.
We walk together along the same path but on different sides of the road. Your shadow sometimes crosses over mine, and I feel the warmth of our friendship along the forms of shade and sun. Your graceful silhouette casts over a vast area that I only dream of exploring. People flock to it, seeking relief from the hot summer rays, and your shade only grows. People love the confidence of your movements, the beautiful contours of your face.
In the evening, after the sun has set, I hear about it how your shadow has molded with others—dark hills of lips meeting other lips. You say that you are tired of dating, done with seeing Harvard boys. And I just wonder what it would be like to have my own silhouette gazed upon with such desire and lust. Sometimes I think you do not realize how much your beauty influences the people that gaze in your direction.
Friend, I admire your shadow. Its influence transforms the surrounding views of many. I sometimes think I am not worthy to have our paths overlap, considering how cool you really are.
You say I am sometimes conservative in my actions, that I should be more confident in myself. Your coverage seems effortless; you never seem to be stretched too thin. Yet I know how determined you can be.
You never directly tear me down. I realize that you are full, and that it is easy to overlook the times I am feeling down. Your comfort is cheerful and high but the shape of your embrace is swift and fleeting. I sometimes have a hard time believing your quick words because I have a hard time believing the spans of my shadow myself. I wonder how you observe your own shadow, how others see mine.
Although at times I feel small in comparison, you make me want to reach and grow, to take more risks, even if it means my outline might get lost in the crevices of the brick for a little while before they resurface. The sun rises with a new semester, a new home with new figures walking by our paths along the street. There are too many times when I have felt lonely, but hopefully this new light casting down upon us will make me less afraid to step out of my comfort zone into new paths of light. You make me want to feel safe in my own set of darkness. But until then, I guess I’ll keep crawling out of the crevices towards the edges of light.
[Fall]
Now with the semester coming to an end, I realize that it has been a long march. My pack is heavy. I am tired. Even though you’re usually right next to me, I barely see you now. Our paths cross less. We live differently. Sometimes your shadow crosses mine, but now its often brief and fleeting. On my own trail, I can only guess what is beyond the brush.
Yet the distance has allowed me to grow, to strengthen my own legs. I realize that I do not want my shadow to stretch like yours, but to be dense and full of feeling, raw honest feeling.
The lack of sleep makes me realize that for what its worth, I am working, I am living. To breath in the dark cool air during the late nights in the d-hall, seeing others around me working hard, my actions have to be deliberate, time is sparse, and things always have to be gotten done. For all its worth, it’s worth it. For you and me, we are living our lives deliberately, and differently, from each other. Neither is bad. I can learn and will keep walking. My shadow will twist and turn the rhythm of my own gait. I have come to terms with trying to love myself instead of comparing myself with others that cross the same trail. I am enough. Because at the end of the day, when the sun goes down, it is not the shadow that defines, but the being that creates it.

Clad in a crimson-colored wrestling unitard, Undergraduate Council presidential candidate Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17 cradles his much smaller running mate, Jeffrey M. Ott ’16-’17, in a promotional campaign poster shared on Facebook.
When it comes to physique, more than 100 pounds in weight and 10 inches in height separate varsity wrestlers Gajdzik and Ott, but when it comes to their relationship, the mismatched duo is quite close.
“In wrestling, it’s almost a phenomenon where the big guys and the smallest guys always hang out with each other,” Gajdzik said.
If elected, Gajdzik and Ott would be the first varsity athletes to serve as president and vice president of the UC in years, which, Gajdzik said, was “one of the big things that inspired us to run.” The pair, the only ticket running for UC leadership without any prior experience on the body, touts a campaign platform that focuses on the experiences of student-athletes in addition to other general issues such as campus social life and sexual assault prevention.
“We feel like it’s a voice that’s been left out of the conversation for the last decade or so,” Gajdzik said. “We want to address that by bringing in a new perspective.”
Bonding freshman year as wrestling recruits from different parts of the country, Gajdzik and Ott now share a small double in Kirkland House.
“Their beds are only six inches apart. They’re separated by a fan,” said Nick J. Stager ’16, one of Ott and Gajdzik’s blockmates. “So when you talk about putting heads together, they’re doing it in a very literal sense.”
Gajdzik, a Government concentrator, describes himself as a “Midwest boy through and through.” Before coming to Harvard, Gajdzik lived in Ohio and Michigan, where, following in his family’s tradition, he played football. Gajdzik said his temperament was too mild for football, so his father suggested he try wrestling to become more aggressive. After discovering his talent for the sport, though, Gajdzik remained a wrestler.
“I’m sort of the black sheep of the family on this one,” Gajdzik said. “Both my uncle and dad played college football; my little brother plays football at the University of Chicago.”
Ott, who studies psychology, grew up in Massachusetts and was homeschooled from first to sixth grade, a period Ott describes as particularly formative.
“A lot of the eccentricities that I am very proud of and enjoy now were formed during my homeschool years,” Ott said. Among these quirks is Ott’s love of birdwatching, an activity he often pursues in Harvard Yard and in Mount Auburn Cemetery.
“It’s so peaceful—it’s the most tranquil experience I can imagine,” Ott said, calling himself “one of four birdwatchers on campus.”
Both Gajdzik and Ott took leaves of absences last year to pursue their wrestling careers outside of the collegiate setting. Gajdzik honed his wrestling skills at a regional Olympic training center. Ott planned to train as well, but after an unexpected injury, he ended up spending part of the year as a substitute teacher and part on a trip to Australia and New Zealand.
“My year off gave me so much perspective on how important this place is, and how much opportunity we have here to be great in anything we want,” Gajdzik said, referring to Harvard. “After a while, you lose sight of all this place has to offer.”
Their rediscovered appreciation for Harvard helped identify areas where they claim the College falls short of its promise.
“This place definitely has its faults, and that’s why we’re running for UC,” Gajdzik said. “There are things right now that are getting in people’s way of prospering, and that shouldn’t be the case.”
Unlike the other two tickets, each of which includes at least one current or former UC representative, neither Gajdzik nor Ott has served on the UC, a fact they argue will not will disadvantage them if they are elected.
“We do have to recognize that we don’t have any experience on the UC, but none of the other candidates ha[s] been on the UC for more than a year,” Ott said. “There’s going to be a very steep learning curve for whoever is put into this position.”
One ticket has two members — Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 — who were both elected to the UC in September 2014. UC presidential candidate William A. Greenlaw ’17 was also elected that September, while his running mate, William F. Morris IV ’17, is an outsider to the UC.
Gajdzik and Ott argue that their position as outsiders gives them an advantage over their more experienced opponents.

“When you’re part of a group for so long, you become socialized into that group, and that inevitably limits the kinds of perspectives that can be given,” Gajdzik said. “We think as outsiders we bring in an entirely fresh perspective.”
In creating their UC election platform, Gajdzik and Ott drew on their own experiences as varsity athletes. Some of their goals include extending dining hall hours, ensuring more houses serve hot breakfast, and making it easier for athletes to choose a wide variety of concentrations.
On weekends when teams have games and practices, athletes are often unable to eat the hot meals served only at 11:30 a.m. brunch. Instead, they turn to less wholesome options like granola or cereal.
“Basically we’re forced to go to the d-hall, eat some super…sugary cardboard, and then be expected to go out there and perform [our] best, which is incredibly, incredibly tough to do,” Gajdzik said.
Evening practices also prevent many athletes from eating dinner before most dining halls close, according to Gajdzik and Ott. While Currier House and Dunster House have already extended dining hall hours, the UC hopefuls want other Houses to do the same.
Perhaps most significantly, the pair is calling on the College to decrease the number of concentration courses that meet between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., the window when many varsity teams practice. Expanding the number of courses that meet outside this window would give athletes more flexibility in their choice of concentration, Gajdzik and Ott argue.
“I know plenty of my friends who were kind of pigeonholed to do one of the ‘big three,’” Gajdzik said, referring to the Psychology, Economics, and Government concentrations. Ott said his commitment to varsity wrestling forced him to forgo his first-choice concentration. The pair argues that these proposed policies will benefit not only varsity athletes, but all students.
Even though Gajdzik and Ott’s policy platform has a particular focus on varsity athletes, the pair emphasized their commitment to issues that affect the entire student body. They say they hope to address issues surrounding mental health, sexual assault, and social spaces on campus.
Students often find it difficult to talk about and seek resources for mental health issues because of pervasive stigma, Ott said, noting that he has “struggled” with these problems in the past.
“If there are things bugging me, I don’t really talk about them,” Ott said.
To combat this stigma, Gajdzik and Ott said they want a psychologist to meet with the entryways of every upperclassman House and freshman dorm at the beginning of each school year. In these meetings, Ott said psychologists could reassure students that seeking help is “normal” and “something you shouldn’t feel bad about.”
The pair also said students often feel reluctant to report instances of sexual assault or harassment to administrators.  
“We need to make sure people feel absolutely 100 percent comfortable that Harvard is going to do all that they can to seek justice for the victims,” Gajdzik said.
Gajdzik and Ott also want the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to meet with all entryways at the beginning of each year to remind students about resources and reporting mechanisms related to sexual assault.
Discussions about sexual assault that have dominated campus conversation this semester have brought attention to what students call a lack of safe social spaces at Harvard. Gajdzik and Ott have proposed what they describe as ways to make it easier for students and student groups to throw Harvard-sanctioned parties. For example, the two proposed making expedited party forms—for students to apply to host parties on short notice—available in more Houses. 
Although their platform addresses serious issues on Harvard’s campus, the two have made their campaign “fun,” Ott said. At a UC election debate co-hosted by The Crimson on Saturday, Gajdzik and Ott wore wrestling unitards and challenged the two opposing tickets to a game of water pong and a push-up contest, respectively.
UC presidential candidate William A. Greenlaw ’17 lost the push-up contest to Ott, 80-49.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students trekked to New York University this past weekend to participate in the second annual Uprising Conference, an event bringing together black activists, entrepreneurs, and students to network and promote solidarity.
“The Uprising Conference is about social change, career, and identity, and drawing a connection between all,” said Riley Jones, chief financial officer of BLOC, the collective behind the event. “Most times as black students, we often segment into one of those three but rarely we do we have a space to talk about all three with each other.”
According to Jones, BLOC has previously hosted similar events across the country. In addition, the group is developing a web application aimed at increasing these events’ reach.
The group’s funding comes from corporate sponsorship and conference registration fees.
BLOC cited “I, Too, Am Harvard,” a 2014 multimedia campaign that brought attention to issues of racial inclusivity on campus, as one of its partners.
“[BLOC talks] about what is important to black students and make sure that we’re strategic about it,” said Paige R. Woods ’16, one of the “I, Too, Am Harvard” organizers. “Something we say is that knowledge plus networks equals power.”
The weekend event featured career- and activism-oriented keynote addresses, mixers, workshops, and panel discussions featuring more than 30 speakers. The subjects of these talks included government, visual and performing arts, entrepreneurship, journalism, research, social advocacy, and business.
According to BLOC, approximately 350 people participated in the conference’s programs.
“It’s really great that black students are able to come together to discuss ways we can promote black unity,” said Alicia Jones, a participant at the conference. “We don’t get to talk about all of these issues all at once as often as we should, and having all these people converge really puts all of these ideas side-by-side, creating an discussion that is ultimately more fruitful.”
BLOC’s Jones said that the collective tries to bring together a diverse group of speakers.
“The main thing that BLOC is trying to accomplish is that black students, not just at Harvard, but all schools, have the resources that are available in our community that are available for everyone,” Jones said.

With one hand on a Red Bull and one hand flying across the keyboard of a MacBook, Boston University senior Andy Shen showed off the computer project he made while spending 36 hours at HackHarvard’s 2015 hackathon.
The event, which lasted from Friday to Sunday, saw hundreds of students from multiple universities converge on Harvard’s campus to create digital projects using new technology.
Sponsors of the event included Microsoft, Facebook, Capital One, Twitter, and Google, and representatives from the companies gave advice to the students, many of whom stayed up all night working on their projects.
“You can ask [the representatives] for advice on how to use their tools,” Shen said. “It’s really personal.”
Organizers of the hackathon said this year’s conference drew a particularly diverse crowd.
“We have people who are involved with government and education who are pairing with experienced CS kids, and coming together to combine their interests and create one really cool project,” said Eric S. Timmerman ’19, one of the organizers.
Zehra Naz ’15, one of the mentors from Microsoft, praised the hackathon environment.
“All this innovation in one place,” she said. “Yes, you can use Google or Bing search, but it’s different being in a place with all these people using the newest technologies.”
She added that the presence of professional mentors allowed students to innovate during the event.
“You have the help right there, the resources right in this room to make your product happen,” Naz said. “Having all these resources in one room accelerates your learning and your development time, because you know there are people there to help you.”
She said that even the advisors learned from the other people in the room.
“I personally learned a lot at this hackathon,” she said. “I know from talking to people that they learned a lot as well. There was even a group of people who said that they were going to use the next 36 hours not to make a product, but to go through and learn.”
Naz said she is proud of her alma mater for providing students with these opportunities to experience new technology.
“When I came in, in 2011, the [Computer Science] community was really small,” she said. “Now we have hackathons. We as students get to interact with companies and interact with people in tech.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At a lively debate on Saturday night, the three tickets competing to lead the Undergraduate Council all said Harvard should recognize single-sex organizations and agreed that the University should not ban students from joining male final clubs.
Final clubs and the College’s social spaces have come under increased scrutiny from both students and administrators this fall, and much of Saturday’s debate, co-hosted by The Crimson and dubbed the “UC-Crimson Crossfire,” focused on the candidates’ perspectives on the College’s current social climate and their proposals for making the social scene more inclusive.
When asked how they would have voted on a proposed UC referendum that did not make the ballot but would have called on administrators to restrict student membership in final clubs, all candidates said they oppose such a move.
“The University spends too much of its time pressuring off-campus entities for their shortcomings,” said Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17, a presidential contender. “Right now, the University is scapegoating the final clubs because they have been inept. They have robbed you, as students, of the opportunity of going out on Friday and Saturday nights and enjoying your Harvard experience to the fullest.”
All the candidates also said they support the University recognizing single-sex social groups on campus. Presidential candidate Shaiba Rather ’17, the only female candidate on stage in front of the packed Harvard Hall classroom, said women need spaces where they feel empowered in a male-dominated world. 
William F. Morris ’17, a vice presidential candidate who is also a member of the fraternity Sigma Chi, argued that Harvard should stop treating single-sex organizations as “the root of all evil on campus.”
Candidates generally agreed that it was important to encourage students to take advantage of currently underused spaces for social events, and they criticized the high rent fees for event rooms in the upperclassman Houses.
“What I think is that we’re overlooking the obvious, that there exist spaces that we’re not currently using,” said William A. Greenlaw ’17, who is running for UC president. “If they really believe that social life should be centered on the Houses, then open up these spaces for student organizations.”
Rather and running mate Daniel V. Banks ’17, both veteran UC representatives, proposed using the UC budget to improve social spaces.
“It’s about making the social spaces on campus actually accessible to students,” Banks said. “We’d like to repurpose the $30,000 we have on the Undergraduate Council to build social events for students.”
The results of the recently released sexual assault climate survey, characterized by University President Drew G. Faust as “deeply troubling,” also loomed large in the debate. Candidates proposed new training and guidelines for student groups to combat sexual assault.
Rather proposed creating a bystander intervention program to prevent sexual assault, citing the survey statistic that reported 80 percent of Harvard students had “witnessed a drunk person heading for a sexual encounter” and did not intervene.
Greenlaw proposed using the UC grant process to reward student groups that have been proactive about seeking training and resources for sexual assault prevention.
All three teams disparaged the General Education program, which a faculty committee last spring deemed “failing on a variety of fronts” and faces overhaul. Morris and Banks both called the program a “failure.”
Gajdzik said it was overly “bureaucratic.” “We need to get administrators out of the classrooms and let the professors do their darn jobs,” he said. 
The debate also featured more lighthearted moments when the candidates had the opportunity to ask each other questions. Gajdzik and his running mate Jeffrey M. Ott ’16-’17 challenged their opponents to a round of water pong and a push-up contest, which prompted enthusiastic responses from the audience.

Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. “Danny” Banks ’17 settled into an easy mood as they began to banter in a recent interview. “We’ve worked out our dynamic—specifically when to bicker and when not to bicker—quite nicely… but mostly when to bicker,” Banks joked.
The charismatic duo became close after joining the Undergraduate Council last year, when Rather and Banks were elected as sophomores from Cabot and Dunster House, respectively. The two share many interests, including the fact that they are both Social Studies concentrators, and now reference their friendship as a strength of their ticket to run the UC as president and vice president next year.
“I think that has a lot of merit when you’re trying to make big changes,” Rather said. “We know how to complement each other really well.”
But aside from their close friendship, Rather and Banks and their supporters boast their experience both inside and outside the UC. Rather and Banks are the co-chairs of the UC’s Student Initiatives Committee. According to Banks, the committee was previously reactionary and mainly served to fund student requests, but has since become the UC’s second largest committee with a budget that has expanded by 50 percent.
The other accomplishments on the Council they tout include bringing Halal chicken to dining halls, renovating the religious prayer spaces located in Canaday basement, and establishing the Harvard Project, a grant program for student initiatives.
“Both are very magnanimous… they command your attention and respect,” said Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, a Cabot House UC representative and the ticket’s campaign manager. “They are two people on the Council that I would want to work with the most.”
Rather and Banks are running on a platform of establishing what they describe as an “Open Harvard.” Rather argues that it is not a coincidence that conversations about sexual assault, mental health, and final clubs are happening at the same time, but instead a product of students not feeling at home here.
“It’s because students don’t feel safe on this campus,” Rather says. “They don’t feel like they have ownership of the space on this campus.”
Outside of the UC, both Rather and Banks are heavily involved in extracurricular activities.
Rather is a peer advising fellow and Room 13 counselor and participates in the South Asian Association, Asian American Mental Health Task force, the Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service, or OAASIS, and the mock trial team. Banks is the founder of the UC’s BGLTQ caucus, administrative chair of Dunster House Committee, and a member of the College’s Honor Council and the University Committee on Rights and Responsibilities.
Also speaking to life and activities outside the UC, at the top of the pair’s agenda is fostering what they say would be inclusive social life on campus under the prong of “Open Social Spaces.” “It’s important that you are able to claim ownership over a space,” Banks said.
Their agenda items on this part of their platform focus on accessibility in the Houses, specifically proposing putting ramps in all dining halls and establishing gender-neutral bathrooms in all student life buildings.
“It’s not that hard to put a ramp in every House,” Banks said. “And not all Houses, buildings, or dorms are accessible to people who don’t fall in the male or female part of the gender spectrum.”
In addition to proposing repurposing $30,000 in UC funding to support open student parties, Rather and Banks also devote a large part of their platform to discussing campus social life and the role of Harvard’s final clubs, a focus of recent administrative scrutiny.
As officials from University President Drew G. Faust to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana criticize the groups, claiming that they are exclusive, two historically male clubs have gone co-ed. That news has dominated recent campus discussion.
Like the other two tickets running for UC leadership, Rather and Banks said at a Crimson-hosted debate on Saturday that they would have voted against a proposed referendum calling on Harvard to ban undergraduates from joining all-male final clubs. They also said Harvard should recognize single-sex social organizations, and in an interview reiterated that while they think the decisions of several final clubs to go co-ed is a large step in making Harvard more inclusive, it is not a panacea.
“It’s incredibly important that we recognize that those people in the final clubs are our friends. They’re Harvard students. They’re people in our classes and who we eat in the dining halls with,” Rather said. “The administration needs to stop this policy of dividing Harvard students.” 
Their campaign platform does, however, call for some significant changes to the groups and their membership selection processes. Rather and Banks say they would like to see final clubs release their membership demographics as well as open the punch process, pointing out that social organizations such as the Seneca, fraternities, and sororities already engage in open selection processes.
They also propose that final clubs host regular open parties, which they said was an idea suggested to them by several members of final clubs. In formulating their platform, Rather and Banks said they approached active club members for advice.
In the second prong of the ticket’s platform, calling to “Open Dialogue,” Rather and Banks say they want to change the way students talk about mental health and sexual assault on campus, two other topics that have attracted attention from students and administrators this year.
On one point, Rather and Banks propose supplementing professional mental health services from Harvard University Health Services with personnel in the Houses themselves.
“There’s a barrier to entry of walking into UHS, clicking the fourth floor, and then sitting in a lobby that has a sign that says ‘Counseling and Mental Health Services.’ That’s scary for a lot of people,” Rather said.
With regards to sexual assault, Rather and Banks suggest implementing a bystander intervention program. They said they have been working on such a program for three months with administrators from the Office of Student Life, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services, and Banks argued that this initiative would take the necessary preventative approach to addressing sexual misconduct on campus.
Two of their proposals in this part of their platform are policy-specific and especially ambitious. First, they call for Harvard to adopt a sexual assault policy of affirmative consent, just more than a year after the University rolled out a new sexual harassment policy that lacks an explicit affirmative consent clause.
Second, the pair propose securing a seat for a student representative seat on Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body that is hundreds of years old and has long been composed of alumni who advise Harvard leaders.
On their campaign website, Rather and Banks claim that this group “controls Smith Campus Center, UHS, sexual assault & final club policy,” although in fact many other administrators are involved in making those day-to-day decisions and the Harvard Corporation is the University's highest governing body.
Still, Rather and Banks argue that among a board of alumni, a student would best represent and advocate on behalf of undergraduates. “How can someone who attended this College when there were no women make policy advice on sexual assault?” Rather said. “We want to put a student representative on that board, that can ideally represent where the campus is right now.”
Rather and Banks devote the last third of their platform specifically to freshmen. A large part of that involves proposals that they say will make Harvard more socially inclusive for freshmen.
“We want to recenter freshman social life to the yard, so that freshmen have a place to call their own,” Banks said.
Some of their proposals involve repurposing existing spaces, like turning FlyBy, housed in Annenberg, into a late-night dining option for freshmen, akin to the grills in upperclassman Houses. They also say they plan to work side-by-side with Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 to repurpose a space for freshmen.
Others would be more drastic changes, like changing Harvard’s alcohol policy to be “open door,” a rule that at some other schools allows students to drink in their dorm rooms without being disciplined if doors are open to residential staff.
“Freshmen are robbed of their common rooms because of the ‘no alcohol’ policy,” Banks said.
“We’ve seen and experienced how space on campus is closed off. Our first instinct was and is to work to open them. That’s what we’re trying to do with Harvard,” Rather said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Aspiring social entrepreneurs from around the world convened Saturday at the fifth annual Igniting Innovation Summit at Harvard to discuss the importance of pursuing sustainable social change.
The conference, organized by a team of Harvard undergraduates, drew 450 attendees from Harvard, nearby Boston-area colleges, and universities across the country.
The event helped students think about the practical concerns that do-gooders face as they strive to change the world.
“I didn’t realize until I came here that there’s this really big conflict between having a passion to enact social change and then also making it sustainable like a business model should be,” attendee Zeynep G. Ertugay ’19 said. “I think learning about how to bring those two things together is the core of social entrepreneurship, and coming here really helped me realize that.”
The conference featured three keynote speeches, 10 panel discussions, a performance by “socially-conscious, community-minded” hip-hop and soul band Afro D All Starz, and an Innovation Showcase in which representatives from 18 successful social ventures presented their projects.
Five teams of high school entrepreneurs, identified as “global trailblazers” by the Village to Raise a Child program, also presented their ideas to a packed room.
“The purpose is to show people that there are people your age, or even younger than you, who are doing awesome things and pursuing something they are passionate about, and they’re actually creating an impact,” said Hamna M. Nazir ’17, one of the co-directors of the conference and an inactive Crimson news editor.
Nazir and her co-director Cindy Niu ’16 said the conference aimed to educate attendees about sustainable, scalable social change and to motivate them to pursue the causes they hold dear.
Nazir said, “I think that especially at Harvard, that’s something that we’re excited [about]: that right now you can take the lessons you learn in school and apply them elsewhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As recruiting season gets underway for sophomores and juniors thinking about consulting jobs, some minority students attended a special event on Friday where consulting firms specifically aimed their messages at them.
Students from diverse backgrounds gathered at the Faculty Club for the ninth annual Diversity Recruitment Consulting Conference hosted by the student group Aspiring Minority Business Leaders and Entrepreneurs.
Conference organizer Nicky Kwon ’16 said that the conference—which was sponsored by and featured representatives from consulting firms like the Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company, Monitor Deloitte, and Bain & Company—aimed to “help students from diverse backgrounds launch on a successful business career and increase overall minority representation in business.”
“One of the challenges for this type of conference is attracting people who have never considered going into consulting, or other types of business, as an option,” Kwon said. “Some people don’t end up exploring business as a career option simply because they are unfamiliar with the sector or have certain prejudices against it.”
AMBLE partnered with other student groups including Women in Business, Black Students Organization, Black Men’s Forum, and Latino Men’s Collective to maximize the conference’s student outreach.
Conference attendee Natalie Cho ’17 said she wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to meet with multiple companies at the same time.
“I thought it would be an opportunity for me to get a broad range of information as well as more specific firm-based information,” Cho said.
The main event was the Diversity Consulting Panel, where professionals from the different companies addressed a full room and answered questions about their duties, the way a sense of community is fostered among diverse people at their workplace, and the initiatives the firms use to attract potential recruits.
Amahdi A. Shabaka ’17 said the conference was more than just a chance to hear about the diversity initiatives each firm has.
“A large part of the reason I like to come to these events and talk with people of color and diverse backgrounds is so I can really ask them questions about how diversity has affected their experience [and] what it really means to be diverse at these firms,” Shabaka said.
According to Shabaka, the most important point in the panel came from Kwame Spearman, a representative from Bain & Company, who said that minority students do not necessarily have the familial or institutional connections that tell them what to expect from a career in consulting.
“It’s really important for people of color to be aware of what’s going on within the industry and to be made aware of the process,” Shabaka said. “It’s valuable in terms of establishing that feeling...that people of color have access to these things.”

Dressed in business attire, members of the Class of 2016 flocked around the Quad on Friday for the chance to interview with 30 organizations in the public sector on the second annual Public Service Recruiting Day.
“Last year was a really innovative idea,” said Gene A. Corbin, assistant dean of student life for public service. “We don’t know any other peer institution that is doing this.”
The event saw an increase in scope from its inaugural year, with more student applicants and 10 additional participating groups. According to Center for Public Interest Careers director Travis A. Lovett, 182 seniors applied, with 130 receiving an interview. Participating groups included media outlets, non-profit organizations, and local governments.
“We know that the public interest sector doesn’t have the same resources for recruiting that the private sector has,” Corbin said. “We’re trying to provide a structured and early recruitment process much like the private sector.”
Students and recruiters alike were thankful for the opportunity to network.
“Being a non-profit, we don’t have the opportunity to attend a lot of things like this,” said Patricia A. Pinchinat, a recruiter for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The NAACP was one of the new public sector employers in attendance this year.
Last year, 23 seniors received job offers through the event, according to Lovett. Students said they hoped for similar luck this year.
“I’ve been interested in public service my whole life,” said David K. Kilstein ’16, who interviewed with the NAACP and with Baltimore Corps, which puts people to work improving the troubled city. “I feel like it’s my responsibility to pay it forward in this sense.”
The event came amid increased advocacy for public service opportunities on campus. In September, administrators announced that the University had received a $15 million donation to support public service initiatives at the College, as part of its ongoing capital campaign.
Organizers said they are confident that the event has staying power and will continue to increase in size.
“Organizations, if asked, are eager to be here on campus meeting with our students,” said Amy Howell, director of internships and career services at the Institute of Politics. “We thought an increase of 10 organizations was substantial, but we are confident we could grow more.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three of the most acclaimed recent architectural works in the world were initially met with scorn and derision.
Their creator, renowned architect Frank O. Gehry, told his stories of overcoming criticism at the Institute of Politics on Friday as he discussed the design and construction of three of his most famous buildings—the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain; Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles; and his private residence in Santa Monica, Calif.
Gehry, who once dropped out of the Harvard Graduate School of Design before eventually winning the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989, was part of the team charged in 2004 with creating a master plan for Harvard’s expansion into Allston. He also designed the Ray and Maria Stata Center at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which sued Gehry’s firm in 2007 for alleged design flaws.
At the packed IOP Forum event, Gehry spoke at length about his inspiration for renovating his Santa Monica home. With a budget of what he said was $50,000, Gehry built a new house around the existing Dutch gambrel structure. He said he wanted to preserve the iconic presence that his home had as the only two-story house in the immediate area.
“Because I didn’t have much money, I used corrugated metal. And because I was interested in the nihilism that was prevalent, I was looking for a metaphor for that…and I sought out the most despised material universally—chain link fence,” Gehry said.
When completed, the new structure was hardly popular with the neighbors. Gehry said they complained that the residence was no longer “normal.”
Gehry said he retorted to one neighbor: “You’ve got two trailers in your backyard. You’ve got a chain link fence around those. In your front yard, you have a wreck of a car up on blocks.”
Gehry also discussed the “Bilbao effect,” asserting that the opening of the Guggenheim Museum that he designed helped improve the Spanish city’s then-faltering economy.
“The shipping industry was dead; the steel industry was dead; the brick factories were dying; all of the industries were in decline,” Gehry said of pre-Guggenheim Bilbao. “Today...it’s a different city. It’s got a real smile on its face.”
According to The Economist, tax revenue from tourist spending in Bilbao recouped the museum’s cost of construction in less than three years.
Though today Gehry is something of a local hero, the initial public reaction was harsh, with threats even made against the architect.
A similarly arduous journey — from idea to execution to acclaim — marked Gehry’s 17-year “odyssey” on Los Angeles’s Walt Disney Concert Hall project. Increasing costs led to a halt on construction, and Gehry said he was blamed for the project’s failure.
“Sixty million dollars, seventy million dollars down the tubes—and I was blamed for it,” he reflected. “That was tough for me, because you go out to dinner at a restaurant, and everybody knows somebody from the Philharmonic. They come over and say ‘How could you do that, how could you? Our big chance to get a concert hall and you screwed it up!’”
Today, the concert hall—which is home to the 12-year-old Los Angeles Philharmonic, whose CEO Deborah Borda moderated the event—stands as one of the city’s cultural landmarks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Undergraduate Council voted to issue a four-pronged set of recommendations to Harvard’s sexual assault prevention task force, with one calling on the task force to acknowledge the role of final clubs and other off-campus groups in the prevalence of sexual assault.
Originally, the legislation made little mention of final clubs and other off-campus social groups. Leverett House representative Jullian A. Duran ’18 proposed an amendment that added a provision for members of the task force to acknowledge that off-campus groups be included in discussions about sexual assault, a recent focus of student discourse.
Duran argued that failing to mention these groups would be “skirting around the issue.” He added that his amendment implicitly urges administrators to recognize the groups, which the University cut ties with in 1984. 
Results of a University-wide sexual assault conduct survey conducted last spring indicated that at least 15 percent of reported sexual assaults at Harvard occurred in “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities,” the second most common location of reported sexual assaults behind dorm rooms and a category that was designed to encompass Harvard’s final clubs.
Duran’s amendment passed with 21 votes in favor, six in opposition, and 11 abstentions.
Prior to Duran’s amendment, Winthrop House representative Daniel R. Levine ’17 posed a similar amendment that called on the task force to urge final clubs to accept students of all genders into their memberships. Levine’s amendment failed with 12 votes in favor, 24 in opposition—including UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16—and five abstentions. Many UC reps deemed the move “inactionable” and argued that suggestions to the task force should focus on short-term feasibility.
The three original recommendations include advocating for increased capacity for bystander intervention programs, providing financial incentives for student groups who take “responsible actions” to prevent sexual assault, and expanding student trainings and awareness of sexual assault policy, prevention, and response.
A meeting of the Council’s Finance Committee on Wednesday will determine specifics of the financial incentives for compliant student groups.
Additionally, the recommendation advocating for increased student training toward sexual assault issues includes suggesting annual or biannual Title IX programming for freshmen and upperclassmen alike. Currently, freshmen receive training during their orientation to the College, but there is no mandatory follow up training for upperclassmen.
Aside from sexual assault discussions, Sean D. Kelly, a philosophy professor and chair of a committee to review the College’s program in General Education, spoke to the Council on Sunday about proposals to improving the program. A report issued last semester by members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences characterized Gen Ed as “failing on a variety of fronts,” noting that the program lacks both commitment and identity.
At the meeting, Kelly briefed representatives on potential changes to Gen Ed, including an explanation of distribution requirements, as well as a streamlined program with only four required courses. The new proposal, Kelly said, will encourage students to consider more courses because it would mandate students to look across academic disciplines. The Faculty is set to review the committee’s proposals next month.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students, alumni, and mental health professionals gathered to discuss the unique mental health struggles that can affect minority students in a “lunch and learn” session on Saturday afternoon.
Amidst a week of demonstrations against racism on numerous college campuses, including the University of Missouri at Columbia and Yale University, the event was co-hosted by the Harvard Black Alumni Society and the Steve Fund, an organization dedicated to wellbeing among students of color and established in memory of a Harvard alumnus who died by suicide.
The event at the Harvard Graduate School of Education featured two experts who drew on both personal experiences and their own research.
Annelle B. Primm ’76, a psychiatry professor at Johns Hopkins University, spoke about her own experience as a student of color during her time at Harvard.
Although Primm found a “familial” network in the black community at Harvard and enjoyed many extracurricular activities, she said she faced challenges because of her race. Primm said she struggled to compete with classmates “from the most elite prep schools in the country” and was concerned that she was “fulfilling some of the negative stereotypes that people have about black students.”
Primm also discussed stigma toward mental illness within communities of color.
“I had concerns about calling attention to myself as a black student and not wanting to look like I couldn’t cut it,” she said. “I think there was, even from my family, that kind of ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps’ mentality. Like, ‘Girl, you’re okay. Get yourself together.’”
Kevin Cokley, a professor in the departments of educational psychology and African and African diaspora studies at the University of Texas at Austin, discussed his research.
He described an “impostor phenomenon,” which he called an “internal psychological factor” that often affects minority students. Those students might feel “like an intellectual fraud,” attribute their success to interpersonal rather than intellectual assets, and find themselves unable to internalize success, he said. Cokley’s recent study revealed that impostor feelings are a strong predictor for mental illness among minority students.
“Confident African-American students slowly and systematically are being broken down, becoming discouraged, and questioning their career goals because of...racial microaggressions,” Cokley said. “High impostor feelings have been linked to increased levels of depression and anxiety among ethnic minority students.”
During question and answer sessions, conference attendees often drew from their own personal experiences. Some had firsthand experiences with mental illness or work as professionals in the treatment field.
“It was more about hearing the stories, the personal experiences and getting the perspectives. It was amazing to hear experiences in being here,” Ritu Sharma, a psychologist at Tufts University, said.
The event marked the start of a partnership between the Steve Fund and the Harvard Black Alumni Society.
The Steve Fund was created in honor of Stephen C. Rose ’06, who jumped from William James Hall to his death at age 29 in 2014. The organization is dedicated to the emotional and mental well-being of college students of color.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid a string of successful seasons for Harvard football, the athletic department counts 1,665 football season ticket holders. On Saturday, more than 900 of them packed the Gordon Indoor Track for an appreciation event that is one of the department’s main ticket holder engagement initiatives.
The event, which included a luncheon and raffle, preceded the Crimson’s afternoon game against Penn and drew alumni as far removed from their college days as Paul I. Lee ’46, who will be heading to New Haven for his 73rd Harvard-Yale game this fall.
“This is tremendously important for both our season ticket holders and our department,” said Nick Majocha, an assistant director of athletics who runs the ticketing office. Majocha, who has organized the event annually since 2012, said the luncheon is meant to build community and encourage alums’ continued involvement with Harvard football.
“We have such a diverse group of people in this community, so to be able to have an event that lets them congregate...is really important to giving back and to maintaining that strong season ticket holder base,” Majocha said.
Between performances by the band and cheerleaders, a raffle with items like signed helmets, and the luncheon, attendees commended the department’s ticket holder outreach efforts.
“Having an event like this really helps build up the enthusiasm of the season ticket holders, brings them together to say, ‘Oh, I didn’t know you’re a season ticket holder,”’ said David Dearborn ’59, a season ticket holder since 1964. “I have half a dozen classmates who sit in different spots around the stadium.”
Some season ticket holders pointed out that the event also allows longtime supporters of Harvard football a unique opportunity to spend time together outside of the stadium.
“This is a relatively new event, but it’s a nice thing for the athletic department to do to recognize those who take out a season ticket,” said Warren “Renny” M. Little ’55. “You see a lot of old jocks you don’t necessarily see in other places.”
Some of the longest-standing football season ticket holders found the event representative of the department’s efforts on their behalf.
John “Jack” P. Hoag Jr. ’54, who counts 48 years as a season ticket holder along with two of his Winthrop roommates, said of Majocha’s office, “They will bend over backwards for people who have been coming for a long time.”
Hoag and his roommates, who also hold men’s hockey season tickets, recalled how after the Bright-Landry Hockey Center seating was swapped before this season, their usual seats wound up in the visitor’s side. “These guys broke their backs after the season started to get us back to where we wanted to be,” Hoag’s roommate Edward C. Bursk Jr. ’54 said.
For the younger alumni in attendance, Majocha said of the event, “It’s an opportunity for some of our new season ticket holders to meet these longtime season ticket holders and feel like part of this club.”
Others found some room for improvement. “I think something like this should be done earlier in the season rather than at the end of the season,” said Eduardo Ramirez, a Crimson football and men’s basketball season ticket holder. “I think it would promote more of a spirit at the beginning, [so] you look forward to a season.”
Over the four years, the fraction of football season ticket holders in attendance has grown from 28 percent to 55 percent.
“It’s an important way to say thank you to our most dedicated supporters,” said Majocha.

William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17 first met by chance in Annenberg Hall during the flurry of handshakes and introductions at the beginning of freshman year. Initially bonding over their shared first name, the pair quickly realized they had much more in common.
Both candidates come from areas that rarely send students to Harvard. Greenlaw, a Government concentrator in Pforzheimer House, hails from a public high school in northwestern Indiana, and is a first-generation college student. Morris, a joint History and East Asian Studies concentrator also in Pforzheimer House, came to Harvard from a town of around 1,200 people in northeastern Georgia. He was the first student from his school to attend Harvard in more than 40 years.
Bearing radiant grins and vibrant personalities, Greenlaw and Morris describe themselves as easygoing yet driven—two qualities that they say qualify them to take the helm of the Undergraduate Council Presidency and Vice Presidency respectively.
From struggles with mental health to criticisms about social spaces on campus, Greenlaw and Morris are trying to connect their personal experiences to combat stigma surrounding mental illness, bolster initiatives for sexual assault prevention, and push for greater support of open social spaces.
Both candidates draw from experience in varied extracurriculars, ranging from vocal impersonations to sexual assault advocacy, as inspiration for their campaign platforms.
Although Greenlaw has been a UC representative for more than a year and spearheaded initiatives on the Council’s finance committee, Morris has never served on the UC. The two say that their leadership in and outside the UC—they are the only ticket comprised of one UC representative and an outsider—means they can better address undergraduates’ concerns.
Outside of the UC, Greenlaw is involved in mock trial, ballroom dance, and serves as Vice President for the Voice-Actor’s Guild, a group that performs voice impression events.
Greenlaw also serves on University President Drew G. Faust’s sexual assault task force, which is tasked with providing recommendations on sexual assault prevention. He cites this experience in voicing support of a referendum on this year’s ballot that calls for opening administrative sexual assault task force meetings to all students.
“I like the idea it is going to put pressure on the administration to allow for student input,” Greenlaw said.
Morris, meanwhile, is an active member of the Harvard International Relations Council and serves as the director of a term-time after-school program in South Boston. He also is the community service and alumni relations chair of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
Morris has most recently sought to bring attention to the topic of undergraduate mental health and the availability of University health resources. In op-eds and on social media, Morris described personal struggles with depression and encouraged other students to publicly share their struggles with mental health. This Thanksgiving break, Morris said he will be speaking at a conference hosted by the Jed Foundation, a national organization for mental health advocacy.
Greenlaw and Morris structure their campaign around three main “pillars”: mental health advocacy, sexual assault prevention, and social space reform.
The pair want to revamp mental health care on campus, starting with University Health Services. Morris said that the UHS should hire more mental health counselors from diverse backgrounds.
“Many issues in mental health are tied to issues of identity,” Morris said. “We’ve heard some horror stories from our friends... the counselors don’t understand where they’re coming from.”
In an emailed statement, Barbara Lewis, the acting chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services, wrote that out of a staff of 28 counselors, seven are people of color, and staff provide counseling on a range of issues.
“HUHS Counseling and Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is always looking for diversity in its staff members, and this diversity comes in many forms,” she wrote. “If students do not feel that they can find a good fit from within CAMHS, they can also be referred to counselors in the area,” she added.
Like with other campaign initiatives, Morris draws on his own experiences—struggling with transitioning to Harvard—to argue for the destigmatization of mental health issues. In September, he published an op-ed in The Crimson about what he said was the stigma surrounding mental health on campus.
Morris and Greenlaw also propose instituting workshops that they would call “Harvard Listens.” These would provide a forum for students to openly discuss issues such as body image, stress, and suicide, Morris said.
“With these workshops, we want to bring people together to talk about these issues that they think are unspeakable,” Morris said.
Although they are running to lead the student government at Harvard College specifically, Greenlaw and Morris said they hope their proposals will set a model for other institutions nationwide.
“We want to be the student government...who tackle the issues that are very sensitive for the sake of the student body in the hope that it will affect the people on campus and will hopefully serve as a model for other campuses,” Morris said.
Morris’s mental health advocacy has already caught the attention of Harvard affiliates both in and outside of the undergraduate body. His Crimson op-ed caught the attention of Nara Dillon, a Lecturer in East Asian Languages and Civilization Department, who said Morris was “very courageous.”
“If I were a student, I would vote for Will,” Dillon said.
Joe L. Choe ’17, a student in Kirkland House who knows both candidates, believes that Greenlaw and Morris can bring about tangible change should they be elected.
“Oftentimes in elections, we hear these lofty goals and empty promises,” Choe said. “They have action steps that are concrete, and they’ve thought through everything in a way that I do believe with confidence that they’ll be able to achieve everything that they promise.”
Greenlaw and Morris have drafted a plan to mobilize and create UC programs to bolster sexual assault awareness through bystander intervention training, and pressure administrators to subsidize costs for social spaces.
The pair propose an additional training program on sexual assault and bystander intervention, in conjunction with the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, which they would call the “OSAPR Connection Bonus.” Greenlaw said they would incentivize student groups, by using a group’s participation in consent training as a criterion for additional funding in the UC grant process.
Over the longer term, Greenlaw and Morris hope to implement a similar incentive-based program that would encourage party hosts to designate sober party monitors and display posters of their faces, names, and contact information during parties. Morris said that Sigma Chi officers already use a similar practice at their parties.
Greenlaw added that all Houses should host early move-in dates for Sophomores in the fall, when affiliates can hold training in addition to bonding activities. “Bind these together: Let sophomores move in early, socialize them together, and teach them community norms, like affirmative consent or mental health,” Greenlaw said.
On the third prong of their platform—social spaces—Morris and Greenlaw are calling on the administrators to increase access to social spaces on campus, a topic that has recently captured the focus of undergraduates. Several House masters have opened up new party spaces this semester, and Faust offered up additional funding for social events to the Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana in October. The College’s unrecognized final clubs have also faced mounting administrative scrutiny, but Morris said social issues extend beyond these groups.
“In my opinion, the final clubs are just a symptom of the problem, they are not the problem [itself.] The problem is the lack of social spaces on campus that everyone can go to,” Morris said.
Greenlaw and Morris said that existing spaces such as dining halls and the rooftop of Felipe’s Taqueria could serve as alternative social venues. The pair advocates for administrators to subsidize or waive fees to rent on-campus spaces, and subsidize off-campus space usage by student groups. Labor for moving chairs and tables could be covered by volunteers in student groups, Morris said.
Although the pair said they do not support a UC-sponsored ballot referendum that calls on administrators to turn Pusey Library into a freshman social space, they plan to push for administrators to acquire additional off-campus social spaces.
“The costs would be enormous, the time would be enormous, and by the time it would be done, likely the [Smith] Campus Center would be completely done,” Morris said of his reasoning for opposing the referendum.
In addition to these goals, Greenlaw and Morris said they hope to increase accessibility on campus, school pride in athletic events, and student involvement on the UC.
“We want to have outreach that goes beyond the UC, we want to make the UC something that the student body they can trust and depend on more than they have in years,” Morris said.
Voting in the UC election opens on Nov. 16.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an email to students on Friday, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana acknowledged recent “events and discussions” about race at other colleges and tied them to Harvard by saying that he will soon unveil “specific initiatives” that have been proposed to “address structural and cultural biases here on campus.”
Over the past few weeks, protests in response to allegations of racism have erupted on campuses across the country, including the University of Missouri and Yale, prompting debate about the experiences of students of color there as well as about free speech. 
“Like many of you, I have been following the events and discussions on other campuses and across our nation about race, inclusion, and the value of open discourse,” Khurana wrote on Friday, praising Harvard students for participating in “these difficult, and sometimes, painful conversations.”
A number of Harvard students have weighed in on the protests via social media, with many posting Facebook statuses in support of protesters at Yale and Mizzou.
Connecting those conversations to Harvard, Khurana said Friday that more needs to be done to increase inclusivity on campus. Khurana called on students to “examine the connections between our practices and the culture we create” and “re-think how we treat each other on a daily basis, specifically questioning what it means to regard someone else as ‘them’ or the ‘other’ and what boundaries circumscribe our understanding of who we are.”
“Change doesn’t happen overnight. But the steps we are taking now will have a lasting impact on our community,” he added.
Specifically, Khurana said he will soon ask students to discuss a number of proposals related to bias on campus. While it is unclear exactly what Khurana was referring to, he wrote that the suggestions would be “specific initiatives that you as students working along-side College leadership have proposed.”
In 2014, the College tasked Pusey Minister Jonathan L. Walton with leading a student-faculty working group to address issues of race and inclusion at the College. The committee has already recommended an extension of the College’s meal plan during spring break to alleviate hardship for low-income students. Khurana has also said that he is preparing a set of recommendations about social life at the College.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the face of mounting pressure from administrators who argue that single-sex social organizations run counter to Harvard’s ideals, 31 of 36 undergraduates in one of the College’s remaining all-male final clubs remain steadfast in their commitment to stay single-sex. 
The undergraduate members of that club—the 179-year-old A.D. Club, located on Plympton Street—have received extensive advice from at least one graduate on how they could defend their policies were Harvard to demand that they admit women, according to correspondence obtained by The Crimson.
In an email to club graduate officers sent Friday in what appeared to be an ongoing discussion among members, undergraduate president Coby C. Buck ’16 wrote that 31 of 36 undergraduates members in good standing with the A.D. oppose any changes in the club’s membership policy.
“As we continue to gauge the member sentiment toward [the] current issues at hand, the undergraduate officers and I thought that it would be productive to share the position of the undergraduate membership of the Club,” Buck wrote in the email.
Attached to Buck’s email was a letter bearing the 31 undergraduates’ formal signatures. Of the other five undergraduates, Buck wrote in his email, some also oppose membership changes, but for “personal reasons” did not sign it.
“We the undersigned undergraduate officers and members of the AD Club are strongly opposed to any changes in the Club’s membership policy,” Buck and club undergraduate vice president Abraham D. Polinsky ’16 wrote in the attached letter. “We are confident that if we maintain the fraternal character that has made the AD such a successful and happy place for many generations, the standing and health of the Club will only improve in future years.”
‘DEFENSE OF THEIR RIGHTS’
All semester, the topic of the College’s final clubs and their place on campus has dominated campus discussion. Top University officials from President Drew G. Faust to Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 have criticized the groups as exclusionary. And Harvard’s sexual assault climate survey results, released in September, suggested that as many as 15 percent of reported instances of sexual assault may occur at final clubs.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, a critic of single-sex social groups who has met multiple times behind closed doors with undergraduate and graduate board members of male final clubs, has been working on a set of proposals addressing social life at the College. It is unclear exactly what those measures address.
Khurana has routinely declined to comment on these interactions, but he has refused to rule anything out, prompting club members to speculate that administrators may go so far as to ban undergraduate affiliation with male final clubs as a condition of enrollment at the College.
In the face of those pressures, two of Harvard’s eight historically male final clubs—the Spee and the Fox—have gone co-ed, with the Fox specifically citing administrative threats as one factor that influenced its decision. The Delphic Club, for its part, has discussed merging with a female final club.
The A.D., however, does not seem to be budging, and at least one club graduate is offering legal advice to support that position.
On Oct. 31, A.D. graduate member Walter L. Foulke ’61 sent club affiliates a memo, addressed to “Gentlemen,” acknowledging pressures on the group to go co-ed and outlining a plan for how it can defend its right to maintain the status quo, given the stance of its undergraduates. 
Foulke suggested in the letter that Harvard views this issue as one between itself and its students—namely, those in final clubs it would demand disaffiliate from all-male groups. Nonetheless, Foulke argued that a move to coerce the all-male clubs into admitting women would face significant legal challenges.
“Although the College has no legal basis to dictate policies to the Final Clubs, nevertheless, it intends to coerce its undergraduates into an illegal, intrusive, and unenforceable ‘contract’ governing their off-campus private lives in order to force the clubs to admit women to their memberships,” Foulke wrote. “I think we should commit to assist our undergraduates in the defense of their rights as vigorously as we can.”
Foulke, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1965 and previously worked in the Pennsylvania attorney general’s office, argued that a mandate for clubs to go co-ed would not only prompt unjustified administrative reach into final clubs’ operations, but would be illegal.
Citing a wide array of Massachusetts and Supreme Court jurisprudence, Foulke raised several legal objections to any requirement or contract Harvard would make with students mandating that they not join a final club. Foulke framed such a policy as an attack on the freedom of association as protected by federal law. He also pointed to “duress,” suggesting that a pledge against joining final clubs drawn from undergraduates would be against the law if the promise were obtained in a threatening way.
Foulke pointed to what he wrote were state protections for the clubs, arguing that precedent has allowed a private club that is not a “public accommodation” to select its membership on the basis of “sex, race, disability, sexual orientation, etc.”
To argue that the A.D. would not qualify as a public accommodation, Foulke contrasted Harvard’s male final clubs with eating clubs at Princeton, undergraduate social organizations that were forced to admit women as a result of a gender discrimination lawsuit in 1990. Unlike Princeton’s eating clubs, Foulke argued, the College’s male final clubs neither receive money from the institution nor are advertised as part of the University’s meal plans.
Foulke also argued that the College cannot apply similar arguments used by Williams and Amherst administrators, who effectively banned their students from joining fraternities, and in the case of Amherst, sororities and similar organizations as well.
Foulke maintained that Harvard cannot rely on that precedent because the final clubs play a smaller role on campus, suggesting that members of the remaining male clubs represent a “vanishingly small portion of the hugely rich and varied social scene available to Harvard undergraduates.”
“Unlike the Amherst/Williams cases, in Harvard’s case there is no discernible university benefit to be achieved via Harvard’s risky proposed mechanism. Any benefits to be achieved are far too trivial in relation to the freedoms that would be abridged,” he wrote.
Foulke also argued in his letter that “Harvard has failed to demonstrate any actual harm done by the Clubs” and that the University’s sanctions on them would have to be “narrowly targeted towards those clubs that Harvard had succeeded in demonstrating were at fault for failing to maintain discipline.” To Foulke, the A.D. Club is “clearly not in a position of any fault.”
He also argued that administrators appear to be selectively targeting male final clubs and that barring membership from the groups would set a dangerous precedent.
“The clear bias makes no sense and exposes the whimsical behavior of the University all the more dramatically,” he wrote. “The selective targeting of male Final Clubs is entirely capricious and would open the door to the targeting of other licit behavior on the basis of ideological fads.”
“What if, tomorrow, Harvard decided that being a member of the National Rifle Association, the Catholic Church, or the Communist Party was a breach of the ‘contract?’” he added.
Foulke also cautioned against further influence administrators could exert over the clubs if they went co-ed, positing that their involvement would increase liability as well as the likelihood that sexual harassment allegations would surface. “Once women are inside a club full-time, and the inevitable sexual assault harassment allegations start to occur, Harvard’s ability to interfere with that institution’s operations will expand dramatically,” he wrote. “[T]here will be no end to the amount of control Harvard will attempt to assert.”
Various Harvard affiliates have previously raised concerns about the potential for sexual assault to occur on off-campus final club properties, but generally students have suggested that adding women to the memberships of the all-male groups would help combat the problem, not worsen it.
This fall, in the wake of what Faust called the “deeply disturbing” results of a University-wide sexual assault climate survey conducted last spring, final clubs have faced increased scrutiny. Though the survey—which was tailored for use at 27 universities—did not mention final clubs by name, people have pointed to the 15 percent figure of sexual assault incidents reported at “single-sex organizations that are not fraternities or sororities” as a marker of incidents at final clubs. Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88, a member of Harvard’s sexual assault task force who worked on designing the survey, said the category was meant to encompass final clubs.
‘LEGAL AND PUBLICITY HAZARDS’
Foulke concluded in his letter that Harvard would face both legal and logistical challenges were it to try to force the A.D. to admit women against its wishes. Foulke expressed doubt throughout the letter that University administrators would actually enact co-ed mandates. He deemed the A.D.’s legal position “unassailable.”
“Harvard will ultimately understand the significant legal and publicity hazards its proposed approach involves,” he wrote.
Even if administrators were to enact policies mandating that final clubs admit women, Foulke wrote that the policies would make “enforcement impossible without unacceptable intrusiveness,” citing the challenge of identifying which students actually belonged to the groups. He suggested administrators would need to resort to “hearsay, innuendo and indefensible guesswork.”
“Keeping track of who enters which private property, who pays dues to which licit, private organization, and so on is a legal and public relations minefield that the University cannot profitably enter,” he wrote, deeming such a search a “witch hunt.”
A.D. graduate board president Kenneth G. Bartels ’73 declined to comment for this story, and Buck did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Khurana.
In an interview, Foulke said he has received mostly positive feedback on the letter, which he said was circulated widely among final club affiliates.
“I just feel that the dean’s office appears to be overreaching…. I don’t think they have a right to do that,” Foulke said.
“There’s nothing wrong if they want to take a female member, ” he said of final clubs. “But they don’t have to, at least in my view, because of the right of free association.”
If the clubs contacted him for further help, Foulke said, he would likely offer them financial assistance. He said he will withhold donations to Harvard if administrators mandate that the remaining male final clubs go co-ed against their wishes.
“Why give money to an organization that’s trying to strangle one of the ones you like?” he said.
Legal experts have previously suggested that Harvard could effectively argue that it has the right to make the clubs defunct. But one of those experts, Harvey A. Silverglate, a Cambridge civil rights attorney and a longtime critic of the College’s Administrative Board, suggested that Foulke’s memo makes some valid points.
Silverglate said he thinks Foulke drew a fair distinction between the role of the final clubs and social groups on other campuses. Because final clubs are not analogous to public restaurants and do not disadvantage civilian non-members, Silverglate said he thinks Massachusetts public accommodations law would not apply to them.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said private institutions can impose contractual regulations on constituents, but it is unclear how far exactly these could go before interfering with state private association rights.
“I suspect that if this gets to become a legal conflict, it would force Massachusetts courts to articulate in some detail the unique features of Massachusetts law in regards to private association,” Lake said. “It's definitely not well chartered waters.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sexual education advocates took photographs of Harvard students and asked them to share advice on healthy relationships when the #BetterSexTalk project came to Harvard on Sunday.
Stationed in Lowell Grille, the project organizers prompted a few dozen students with the question, “If you could give one piece of advice to a younger sibling about sex, what would it be?” The students were then professionally photographed for #BetterSexTalk’s ongoing photography campaign.
The online campaign, which features portraits of students with their respective pieces of advice superimposed, has attracted national media attention for emphasizing the link between poor sexual education and sexual assault.
“We’re here to highlight a lot of the gaps most students on college campuses had in their high school sex ed classes,” said Josy J. Jablons, the director of #BetterSexTalk who helped facilitate the Harvard photoshoot.
The brainchild of Jablons and fellow New York University student Meghan Racklin, #BetterSexTalk aims to spread information about sexual resources and healthy relationships on college campuses.
After two acclaimed exhibitions at NYU, #BetterSexTalk made Harvard its first stop as it branches out to other campuses. The visit to campus comes just months after Harvard released the results of its sexual conduct survey, which reported levels of sexual misconduct that University President Drew G. Faust called “deeply disturbing.”
Jablons pointed to the differences in the breadth and quality of high school sexual education courses nationwide as an oft-overlooked cause of sexual assault on college campuses.
“It’s ridiculous to expect students to understand consent and safe sexual conduct in college after never having been taught it in their prior schooling,” she said. “When it’s so stigmatized, when are you going to learn it?”
Students who took part in the campaign often drew from personal experience when offering advice.
“One of the most important things to keep in mind for me regarding a positive sexual experience has been comfort,” said Amalia A. Salcedo-Marx ’17.
Both Harvard and NYU student organizers praised the campaign’s personalized, casual format meant to appeal to students.
“The individuality we’ve been able to capture in this shoot is twofold,” said Emilio Madrid-Kuser, the #BetterSexTalk photographer. “Everyone makes their own message, and each portrait is unique. It’s truly a tailor-made outcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down by 12 entering the fourth quarter of Harvard’s season opener, senior guard Shilpa Tummala shot the lights out in the dwindling minutes of Friday’s matchup against Maine. Scoring 11 of her 17 points in the last eight minutes of the matchup, Tummala’s effort was not enough, as the Crimson fell to the Black Bears, 64-53.
The game marked Harvard’s first loss in a home opener since 2008.
Facing a seasoned Maine squad returning all of its starters from last season, the Harvard women’s basketball team (0-1) struggled to get back in the game following a 19-3 run from the Black Bears in the second and third quarters.
“We just dropped in our energy and our talk on defense,” Tummala said. “That really hurt us in that three or four minute spurt when where they were making a run. That just showed a little bit of our youth, [where we were] getting a little rattled by a couple baskets from them.”
Harvard got off to a hot start with sophomore Kirby Porter scoring five within the first three minutes of the contest to take the quick lead. The Black Bears, however, would respond with an 11-5 run of its own to take a one point lead after the first quarter.
In the second and third quarters, the Crimson struggled to find its footing following a five minute spurt were they turned the ball over five times and allowed 12 consecutive points. Harvard had 10 points off turnovers to Maine’s 17.
“Right now they just lack the college experience to pay attention to slip-screens or cuts backdoor and those hurt us,” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “That run, in my opinion, was very disappointing because I felt my team played tired and were in shape. We should not have played tired—we just literally stopped running the floor and playing defense with any kind of intensity.”
With Maine running a full court press early on and playing zone on defense, the Crimson was forced to settle for many three point shots in the first half. Harvard struggled from beyond the arc, shooting 3-for-13 through the first two quarters and making it to the charity stripe only twice.
For a team that averaged nearly 15 assists a game last season, the Crimson struggled to create opportunities, putting up only eight helpers to Maine’s 16.
Harvard managed to string together points late, going on a 12-4 run late in the third, but couldn’t seem to keep up with the Black Bears on defense, allowing 33 over the final two quarters and sending Maine to the line six times.
While the Crimson came within seven following a layup from senior guard Kit Metoyer in the fourth, Harvard wouldn’t come any closer, as Maine would respond with a pair of layups and a three from junior Sigi Koizar, who led all scorers with 22 points.
“I felt this was a tough first game for us because we are very, very young,” Delaney-Smith said.
For a squad that features seven freshman, Delaney-Smith didn’t hesitate to play the rookies in its first matchup of the season. Starting freshman Sydney Skinner took the floor at the one spot and Delaney-Smith rotated out Skinner and classmates Nani Redford and Madeline Raster at the guard spot throughout the match.
“Our freshman are great—we’re really confident in them,” Tummala said. “Going forward in the season they’re going to gain that confidence in the game. This was obviously their first real game, but they all bring such enormous talent to the table.”
Despite the loss, coach Delaney-Smith was enthusiastic about what the rookies add to the program.
“These freshman compete,” Delaney-Smith said. “They make mistakes...but I love how hard they compete, and I think that’s a contagious thing for everybody.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (3-0, 2-0 Ivy) continued its undefeated streak on Friday and Saturday, posting big wins against Dartmouth (0-2, 0-2) and Cornell (2-1, 1-1). The Crimson—which has not lost a regular season meet since it fell to Virginia and Virginia Tech in January of 2014—claimed first in 10 out of the 16 events, highlighted by a pool record in the 200-medley relay.
With its 208-87 and 188.5-106.5 defeat of Dartmouth and host Cornell, respectively, this weekend, Harvard has now won 44 straight meets against the Big Green and nine straight against the Big Red.
The diving team kicked off the meet on Friday with a first place win in the 3-meter competition and a two-three-four finish in the 1-meter. Sophomore David Pfeifer won the 3-meter competition with a score of 351.65—more than 22 points better than the second place finisher—and came in third in the 1-meter. Dartmouth’s Brett Gillis and classmate Bobby Ross finished ahead of Pfeifer.
On the swimming side of the pool, it was a night to remember for the Crimson underclassmen, who scored all but two of the Crimson’s eight individual swimming victories.
“A general sentiment on the team is that we’re all really excited about how the underclassmen are doing,” sophomore Jack Boyd said. “We’ve got a couple really good recruiting classes in a row, and they’re really demonstrating their talent in these early meets.”
Harvard kicked things off with a bang in the very first race, the 200-medley relay. The Crimson team of sophomores Koya Osada, Steven Tan, and Shane McNamara, along with junior Paul O’Hara, claimed first and set a new pool record along the way. Their time of 1:30.16 was almost three-quarters of a second faster than the previous record.
Harvard went on to win the next three events and five out of the next six.
“Going into the meet, we were pretty confident that we’d come out with the win just based on our past history with Cornell and Dartmouth, so our main focus was on the process rather than the outcome,” junior Aly Abdel Khalik said. “That’s the main thing that will translate as the season progresses.”
Tan, who played an important role in setting the 200-medley pool record, also notched big victories in two other events. He came in first in the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 49.23, half a second faster than the second place competitor, and dominated the field in the 100-yard butterfly with a time of 48.10—almost a second and a half faster than anyone else.
“Steven Tan dropped some crazy times on the 100-back, 100-fly, and the relay,” Khalik said. “And overall, the underclassmen have been working really hard and focusing in practice. They’ve been doing really well.”
The underclassmen again led the charge in one-two-three Crimson finishes in three other events. Boyd, a sophomore, just out-touched junior Khalik and freshman Brennan Novak in the 200 free—with less than a tenth of a second separating the three. Freshman Daniel Tran dominated the 200 backstroke in a time of 1:47.66, followed in second and third by Crimson upperclassmen Christian Yeager and Jack Manchester.
Freshman Logan Houck also blitzed the field in the distance events, claiming first in the 500 free by three seconds in another Crimson podium sweep and also winning the 1000 free by a substantial margin of 17 seconds.
Elsewhere, Harvard junior Max Yakubovich won the 200 butterfly, out-touching teammate Jacob Luna, and junior Paul O'Hara claimed first in the 50 free to help cap off the Harvard victory.
Despite the early season wins and the longstanding string of Harvard success, the team says it remains focused on the present.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the finish line just a few meters away at this weekend’s NCAA Northeast Regionals, Harvard cross country’s sophomore Courtney Smith had fifth place and an automatic individual berth to the 2015 NCAA Championships in the palm of her hand.
Then, out of the corner of her eye, she saw an opponent, New Hampshire’s Laura Rose Donegan, bearing down on her, threatening to take away the top-five finish. However, Smith found the extra gear she needed, as the sophomore held off Donegan. It was the cherry on top for the Crimson athlete, who fulfilled her goal of qualifying to the championships.
“It was really exciting,” Smith said. “All season this is what I was hoping to qualify for, so it was really nice to finally see our training and hard work pay off.”
The Crimson men’s and women’s cross country teams both competed at regionals this weekend, races that offered opportunities to obtain team and individual qualification to the national championships. The women finished sixth overall, while the men ranked eighth, falling short of the top-two team finishes required for an automatic berth.
Smith’s time of 20:42 over the six kilometer course put her first among Harvard runners and fifth overall out of 256 at this weekend’s race, held at Franklin Park in Boston. The women’s team ranked sixth as a team out of 38, a significant improvement on last year’s 11th-place finish.
“Our goal this year was definitely to make nationals,” captain Paige Kouba said. “But given the arc of this season, and our finish at the conference meet a couple weeks ago, coming back and getting a solid race was a good testament to the resilience of the team. I’m really proud of our girls for putting themselves out there and not letting the discouragement affect them.”
Sophomore Elianna Shwayder and Kouba finished second and third, respectively, among Crimson runners. Shwayder’s time of 21:36 saw her come 31st overall, while Kouba placed 39th with a time of 21:45. Senior Emma Payne came in at 22:00, good for 54th and was followed closely by freshman Kathryn Gillepsie, who posted a 22:08 and finished 58th.
The race started somewhat uniquely for the runners, with the athletes being greeted by a bottleneck just 400 meters into the meet. While early clustering can disrupt the pace of runners unfamiliar with tight, physical, shoulder-to-shoulder racing, this wasn’t an issue for a Harvard team that calls Franklin Park its home site. Instead, Crimson runners were able to take advantage of their familiarity and get settled into the race quickly.
“It was also really windy,” Smith said, “So I wanted to tuck in the front pack but not necessarily be leading and relax for the first mile or so. It was our home course, the course we practice on, so I knew it really well, and I could work the hills.”
On the men’s side, the team bounced back from a disappointing Heps performance, finishing eighth out of 37 teams in the 10-kilometer race. Harvard’s squad was paced by co-captain Chris Allen, who ran his way to 28th place with a time of 31:27.
“The race went out pretty slow, and it was pretty tactical at the start,” Allen said. “It was all about getting in a good position, and once the race heated up, you had to be ready to go.”
Sophomore Ben Huffman, junior Brandon Price, and freshman Austin Gilbert followed Allen for the Crimson, finishing 52nd, 56th, and 62nd, respectively. The trio finished within seconds of each other, with Huffman finishing in 31:48, Price in 31:54, and Gilbert in 31:58.
Sophomore Gabe Montague rounded out the Crimson’s scoring runners with a time of 32:13, good for 76th. Their times helped Harvard finish sandwiched between Ivy League rivals Yale, who came in seventh, and Brown, who ended ninth.

One after another, the contestants took their final freestyle stroke, hitting the wall and coming up for air after a grueling 200-yard individual medley. One after another, they were greeted by their teammates’ faces, with Harvard swimmers taking first, second, third, and fourth in the event.
Such a phenomenon occurred quite frequently this weekend, with the Crimson women’s swimming and diving team bagging wins over Ivy League rivals Cornell and Dartmouth. Harvard defeated the Big Red, 191-109, while overcoming the Big Green, 217-83, in Ithaca, N.Y.
“We all train together, so having us race and seeing that we’re all close and doing well is really comforting,” senior Danielle Lee said. “I think this is a great start to the season. I know that during October is our hardest training of the season, so we’re all broken down and exhausted, so after this weekend it shows us how strong and tough we are going into the upcoming season.”
Freshman Sonia Wang led a group of standout performers for the Crimson, claiming a trio of first-place finishes in her first collegiate meet. Wang won the 100-yard backstroke with a time of 55.47, followed closely by senior Kendall Crawford, who finished second at 55.68.
The Upland, Calif., native then beat out a duo of Cornell swimmers to finish first in the 100 butterfly before claiming her final victory in the 200 IM, where she won by an almost six-second margin. Lee, junior Daniela Johnson, and sophomore Geordie Enoch finished second through fourth after Wang, touching in between 2:06.13 and 2:06.72, respectively.
Enoch also enjoyed a successful start to her second campaign. The Odenton, Md., native, along with Lee, sophomore Gabby Sims, and freshman Brittany Usinger, helped Harvard get off to a winning start on Saturday morning by winning the 200-yard medley relay.
The sophomore then won the 100-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:05.32, a full second-and-a-half ahead of the second-place finisher. She completed her trio of first-place finishes by dominating the 200-yard breaststroke, finishing four seconds ahead of the second-placed Johnson.
“This year there’s a little bit more of a focus on breaststroke for me,” Enoch said, “because we graduated [Stephanie Farrell '15] last year, who was an amazing breaststroker…. I kind of had to step up into that role this weekend.”
Enoch’s relay partner, Lee, claimed another of the Crimson’s 12 victories—out of 16 total events—in the 200 freestyle. The senior paced the field with a time of 1:51.66, ahead of teammate and second-placed finisher, junior Victoria Chan.
“I was a little exhausted going into the meet,” Lee said. “I was going into the meet hoping for a decent swim, but I was really surprised during this race and feeling really good. I remember I felt good during the first 100 and it was really easy, so I picked up the second 100 and tried to make it even faster. I felt comfortable the whole time.”
After finishing second in the 100-yard backstroke, Crawford rebounded later in the meet with a first-place result in the 200-yard backstroke, swimming five seconds faster than any other competitor.
Harvard also swept the top three places in the 1000-yard freestyle, with senior Sherry Liu coming in seconds ahead of sophomore Regan Kology and junior Willa Wang.
The diving team won both of its events on Friday, helping the Crimson get off to the best of starts. Freshman Mikaela Thompson began her collegiate career in style, winning the one-meter board with a score of 288.40, ahead of second-placed, junior teammate Elina Leiviska.
Leiviska followed up with a win in the three-meter diving event, scoring 315.20 points to finish ahead of teammates Hannah Allchurch and Thompson, who came in second and third, respectively.
“Before the meet, we had a meeting and we all talked about how one of our big goals was to be touching out girls on other teams,” Enoch said. “Continuing to do that will make us successful going forward. But you can never be too confident. Other teams are always going to have great people putting up really fast times, so you can’t get too comfortable.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
No one likes sharing.
But when it comes to the co-owning the Ivy League title, the Harvard women’s volleyball team probably isn’t too upset about it.
A loss to Yale on Friday forced the Crimson into a must-win position to earn a share of the Ivy League title. But the following day, Harvard put on a performance that would make Aubrey Graham proud, earning back-to-back conference championships with a 3-1 win over Brown in Providence.
“It’s such an amazing feeling,” freshman Christina Cornelius said. “This has been our goal since day one…. Just being able to accomplish this goal is such a blessing, and it was such an amazing experience too to play with these girls all the time.”
Princeton (15-8, 10-4 Ivy) swept its final games over Cornell and Columbia to bridge the one-game deficit it faced against Harvard coming into the weekend to split the Ivy League title.
HARVARD 3, BROWN 1
Saturday could have been the senior class’ final game with a loss against Brown (10-16, 4-10).
Senior Kathleen Wallace made sure that was not the case.
One point away from securing a share of the conference title, the San Francisco, Calif., native delivered the her final kill of her game-high 13 to clinch the game and the share of the conference title, eliciting cheers from the squad and the Crimson (14-10, 10-4) fan contingent in Providence, R.I.
“This time I’m a litte more proud of,” co-captain Caroline Holte said. “This is proof that we’re the best team in the league.”
Tied at 20 points apiece in the second set, Harvard had a chance to take a 2-0 lead in the game. But two straight kills from Courtney Palm pushed Brown out to a lead that it wouldn’t surrender, as the Bears won the set 25-22.
“Our motto throughout the year has been success is the only option,” Cornelius said. “So a lot of us brought that up [at the break].”
The third set started off with the teams trading points. But after a Sharon Frost kill put the Bears up 9-8, a Wallace kill, an ace from senior libero Sindhu Vegesena, and a slew of Brown errors propelled Harvard to a 10-2 run and a comfortable lead for the remainder of the set.
Brown jumped out to an early lead in the subsequent set which it held for the first half. But after taking a 13-10 lead, the Bears saw the Crimson claw out from its deficit, this time stringing together a 11-4 run to go up 21-17.
Up 23-19, it was only fitting that two seniors closed out the game for the Crimson. Holte got the team within one point with a kill, and Wallace slammed the door shut with hers on the next play.
Junior Corie Bain came just two kills short of picking up what would have been her seventh triple-double of the season.
YALE 3, HARVARD 1
Out of the title race, all Yale could do this weekend was play spoiler, and it did just that.
Mathematically eliminated from winning a share of the title, the Bulldogs (14-9, 9-5) instead ended the Crimson’s hopes of claiming an uncontested conference championship, taking three sets out of four at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium
Down 22-19 in the first set, the Crimson ripped off four straight points behind Bain, Cornelius and sophomore Paige Kebe. The teams then traded the next two points, leaving Crimson with the serve, one point away from claiming the first set. But two straight kills from Kelly Johnson and an ace from freshman phenom Kelley Wirth helped the Bulldogs steal the first set.
The Crimson would win the third set to prevent a sweep from the hands of its archrival, but Yale would take an early 5-1 lead in the fourth set and would not see that margin drop below three for the rest of the game.
Wirth recorded a game-high 19 kills for the Bulldogs, while Bain led the Crimson with 12 en route to a triple-double.
Yale did help out Harvard on Saturday, however, defeating Dartmouth to prevent a three-way tie atop the conference standings. A tiebreaker at a time and date to be determined between Princeton and the Crimson will decide which team earns a bid to the NCAA Tournament.
“We’re the lucky ones... because we have the experience of knowing what it’s like to play for the NCAA Tournament,” Holte said. Last year we let our nerves get the best of us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The members of the Harvard men’s tennis team will hang up their rackets until January after traveling to the University of Georgia this weekend to compete in the annual Bulldog Scramble.
The three-day event, which closed out the fall 2015 season for the Crimson, featured players from Georgia, Georgia Tech, Notre Dame, and Oklahoma, in addition to nine Harvard players.
Junior Sebastian Beltrame, stepping foot onto the court for the first time this fall after recovering from knee issues, posted a 3-1 record in doubles matches with his partner, sophomore Kenny Tao. The lone loss over the three days came to Emil Reinberg and Nick Wood of UGA, 6-3.
“It was fun to be down in Georgia,” Beltrame said. “It was fun to get back into it and into competition again.”
Meanwhile, junior Brian Yeung went undefeated on Saturday, winning two doubles matches and a singles match en route to a 3-0 mark on the day. The Hong Kong native showed grit in the second-set tiebreaker of his straight-set victory over Notre Dame freshman Grayson Broadus, 6-1, 7-6 (3).
Yeung also posted perhaps the most dominant match of the weekend during the Friday singles round, easily handling Reinberg in straight sets, 6-1, 6-0. His strong overall weekend showing was tempered slightly by a 7-6 (2), 6-3 straight-set loss to Walker Duncan of the Bulldogs in the final day’s singles round.
The entire Harvard team had a strong showing in doubles play on Saturday, posting a 5-3 record.
“[The team] made some good strides and had a good tournament,” Crimson coach Dave Fish said. “Sometimes you work on things and it doesn’t quite gel yet, but a lot of things gelled for the guys this weekend.”
Freshman Chris Morrow and sophomore Xavier Gonzalez opened up Harvard’s play on Friday with a doubles win over Notre Dame’s Nicolas Montoya and Kenny Sabacinski, 6-4. Beltrame and Tao also defeated Carlos Benito and Andrew Li of Georgia Tech by the same score.
The Crimson suffered its fair share of defeats, however, as the tandem of Yeung and freshman Andy Zhou fell on the first day to Notre Dame’s Eddy Covalschi and Brendon Kempin, 6-3. On Saturday, seniors Conor Haughey and Kelvin Lam were defeated by Notre Dame’s Montoya and Kempin tandem, 6-2, and Morrow and Gonzalez were rocked by another Fighting Irish duo, Grayson Schnurrenberger and Sabacinski, 6-1.
The pair of senior Harvard players bounced back the next day, avenging the younger tandem with a 6-4 victory over Schnurrenberger and Sabacinski.
The back-and-forth results may have been a reflection of the fast-paced, uncompromising nature of the matches, according to Fish.
“You go from offense to defense so quickly, players almost have to make decisions on the reflexive level,” Fish said. “The players have to get set…very much so the way a boxer will know when to take risks, but also knows when to put the risk off and let the other person take the chance. It takes time to develop that capacity—it’s learned behavior.”
A prime reflection of the at times volatile nature of the matches was Tao’s Saturday singles match against Michael Kay of Georgia Tech. The sophomore Crimson swept the first set, 6-0, but dropped the second, 3-6, before taking the match with a 6-2 final set.
The Bulldog Scramble marked the last time Harvard will play in a tournament for another two months, but Fish is certain that the lack of competition won’t prevent the players from being motivated by the results of their work.
“They see that they’re developing their capacity to manage a match better,” Fish said. “It’s not just practice—that has a lack of accountability to it—but really putting themselves on the line to manage the back and forth pressure during a match.”
Match management will be a focus for the team as it prepares for the substantive part of its year: Ivy League play next semester.
“We have an off-period now, and we’re going to do the best we can to prepare for the spring,” Beltrame said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On an evening meant to honor the senior Harvard men’s soccer players for their contributions over their careers to the Crimson, senior forwards Jake Freeman, Oliver White, and Tim Schmoll carried the Harvard squad to an offensive rout of Penn, 6-0.
The Crimson (9-6-2, 5-2-0 Ivy) entered Saturday out of contention for the Ivy League title, with Dartmouth holding a two-game lead in the standings at the start of the day. But the team still looked to make a statement in its final home game of the season in one last attempt to make a case for an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament.
This determination showed as Harvard came out firing against an overmatched Penn squad (3-11-2, 1-5-1) at Jordan Field.
“We went out and we were just firing on all cylinders,” Schmoll said. “Everyone just bought in. It was fantastic.”
In the 56th minute, White ran right through two Quaker defenders down the middle of the pitch, stepped into the penalty box, and attempted to juke Penn senior goalkeeper Nick Savino to open up a lane for the score. Instead, White was tripped up, forcing a red card on Savino in his final game for the Quakers and allowing Freeman to finish on the ensuing penalty kick.
The play was indicative of both teams’ performances throughout the match, as Penn was unable to match up to the Crimson’s pace and pressure on the ball.
Back-and-forth play dominated the opening minutes of the contest, as each team searched for weaknesses in its opponent’s defense by pushing long through-balls from the midfield.
Sophomore forward Christian Sady changed that dynamic with two quick goals in the 8th and 11th minutes. A sprinting give-and-go score with White down the left side of the pitch and a shot from outside the 18-yard box into the top left corner of the net off a throw-in opened up the game for Harvard, 2-0.
After early production from the underclassman paved the way for Harvard, the seniors shined for the rest of the match.
In addition to creating and executing an early assist to Sady and drawing the penalty kick, White manufactured two more assists on the day. A tackle on a Quaker defender passing back to the keeper led to a chip that barely clipped Penn’s charging goaltender, and the ball landed directly at Freeman’s feet to set up the first assist. A short cross in the box in the 60th minute to senior forward Michael Innocenzi produced the second to net the Crimson’s sixth and final goal.
Schmoll was the other senior to score, finding the netting after his own give-and-go with just minutes left in the first half. Sophomore defender Justin Crichlow nicely handled a cross that traveled from one sideline to the other along the midfield line to initiate the play.
Not only was the Crimson’s offense stout in producing 28 shots, 18 of them on goal, but the back line defense also played formidably, holding Penn to 6 shots in the match.
“[The defense] has been consistent all year,” said third-year Crimson coach Pieter Lehrer. “[Senior goalkeeper Evan Mendez] in goal has been very consistent.... The whole back line just has been very consistent. They just do a great job, day in and day out.”
The sturdy, swarming play of the backline and midfield defense forced the Quakers to resort to an offense mainly consisting of chipping lobs over the heads of Harvard’s defenders. The tactic did not test Mendez throughout much of the match, as he was able to finish with a clean sheet in the final home contest of his career.
The commanding victory polished off the regular season for the Crimson squad, but it remains to be seen if the result will help the team stamp its ticket to the NCAA tournament.
“There’s been no other Ivy League game all year for anybody that’s won 6-0,” Lehrer said. “So I think it says where we’re at as a team. I think we’re in a good spot to get an at-large bid, but we’ve done everything that we can do and hopefully we get [the bid].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the temperature barely reached the 40 degree mark and the wind howled across the Charles River, the Harvard and Radcliffe crew teams fought against the tough conditions at the Foot of the Charles Regatta against Dartmouth, MIT, BU, BC, Northeastern, and Brown.
In the final regatta of the fall season for both Radcliffe teams and the men’s lightweight team, Harvard managed to wrap up 2015 on a high note with a variety of top finishes from all teams.
One month after the historic Head of the Charles Regatta, the Foot of the Charles represents the end of crew season in New England. Both the men’s and women’s sides had multiple entries in the top 10 for Varsity Eights.
RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHT AND HEAVYWEIGHT
Radcliffe’s showing at this year’s Foot of the Charles was very comparable to its 2014 results. Last year, the heavyweights’ top boat finished second overall, just behind Northeastern’s top entry. The Black and White’s 2014 teams also contributed two other boats to the top 10.
Both Radcliffe lightweight and heavyweight had four Varsity Eight boats finish in the top 10 out of 23 total boats.
The lightweight A boat finished in 22:38.4 for third place overall. Close behind were the top two heavyweight boats, which finished in fifth and sixth places. Rounding out the top 10 with a time of 23:37.2 was lightweight’s B boat.
The women’s Varsity Eights course was moved upstream on Saturday due to strong northwest winds. The Novice Eight and Varsity Four course started at Riverside Boat Club and ended at the Head of the Charles finish line.
Despite the almost wintery weather, Harvard was able to combat the course conditions and secure top finishes for both heavyweight and lightweight boats.
“Overall our time on the course was slower than we’re used to because we had the wind working against us,” sophomore lightweight Jacqui Epstein said. “It added to the anxiety at the starting line.”
Radcliffe had two entries in the Novice Eights and one in the Varsity Fours. Out of nine boats in the Varsity Fours race, Radcliffe’s heavyweight entry finished sixth.
“We did really well in tough conditions,” Epstein said. “We weren’t used to rowing in the wind. I was especially proud of how we finished - we had a strong finish.”
MEN’S LIGHTWEIGHT AND HEAVYWEIGHT
Picking up where the women’s teams left off on Saturday, the men’s side found itself with several boats finishing atop the leaderboard. The top heavyweight boats outpaced much of their competition throughout the regatta.
Although the lightweights finished further down the leaderboard, they had no parallel competition, as no other schools had lightweight entries.
“It was overall a mixed performance,” sophomore lightweight Liam Daily said. “Some boats rowed pretty well, some boats not as well as we’d hoped.”
The men’s team had a strong showing on the heavyweight side for Varsity Fours, with three boats finishing in the top five. The lightweight boats were farther down the leaderboard in a race that featured an abundance of heavyweight teams and only a handful of lightweights.
The Crimson captured first place overall with a time of 13:01.1 from its heavyweight A boat. Boats C and B also managed top-five finishes. They reached the finish line in 13:02.6 and 13:03.0, respectively.
Right after the Harvard’s heavyweight A boat, Brown’s top heavyweight boat was was half a second behind, finishing in second place.
“Brown’s heavyweight team always has a strong showing every year,” Daily said.
Harvard had three other heavyweight entries and four total lightweight entries for Varsity Fours. The heavyweight boats finished 12th, 13th, and 22nd, while the lightweights claimed the 18th, 21st, 25th, and 26th spots out of 27 competing boats.
In a surprising finish in the Open Eights race, the Harvard’s freshman lightweight A boat managed to take second place overall with a time of 12:29.4. The remaining freshman lightweight eight boats dominated the freshman race, taking first and second with times of 13:24.8 and 13:57.3.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forget the 22-game win streak and the prospect of a 2015 Ivy League title. Heading into Saturday’s matchup against Penn at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson had a chance to achieve something even more historic: taking sole ownership of the all-time lead in Ancient Eight titles.
Before this season, both teams boasted 16 conference championships; had Harvard won this weekend, the hosts would have secured a record 17th crown.
Instead, the dark-horse Quakers (6-3, 5-1 Ivy), a team picked to finish sixth in preseason polls, took control early and held on late, fighting to a 35-25 win. The result denied the Crimson (8-1, 5-1) an outright title and rejiggered the Ivy League into a three-way tie for first, with Penn, Harvard, and Dartmouth all sporting one loss.
WIND AT THEIR BACKS
At noontime kickoff, weather readings recorded wind gusts that consistently reached 24 miles per hour.
On the field and in the stands, that number may have felt conservative. Metal goalposts buckled and bent, and scarves rippled. When the Quakers lined up for opening kickoff, a Penn player had to hold the ball in place.
Those conditions hardly changed in the first two quarters. Moreover the wind blew vertically, from one end zone to the other, which put one offense at a clear advantage.
In the first quarter, Quakers senior quarterback Alek Torgersen threw with the wind and completed seven of 10 passes for 158 yards. Meanwhile Crimson senior quarterback Scott Hosch went five of eight for 40 yards.
By contrast, in the second period, Torgersen totaled a mere 13 yards on four completions, while Hosch racked up 86 yards on five completions.
“You just go out and try to make the right reads,” Hosch said. “There were a couple throws that the wind pushed a little but, but [that’s] definitely not an excuse for anything.”
Even so, the scoreboard demonstrated the power of the wind. Although Penn ended the first 15 minutes with a 21-6 lead, Harvard put up 19 unanswered points in the second quarter to head into halftime with a 25-21 advantage.
Perhaps the greatest sign of the windiness was the struggles of Crimson punter Zach Schmid.
During the first period, Schmid kicked into the full fury of the wind and wound up with a pair of 21-yard punts. Some of the squall had calmed down by the third quarter, but Schmid still had to contend with the elements, as evidenced by a 13-yard kick on his first try after halftime.
FOURTH-AND-NONE
Few games actually hinge on a single play, but significantly more games seem as if they do—as if an individual snap can irrevocably swing momentum.
At the time, and in retrospect, the fourth-and-one that Harvard faced at the end of the third quarter felt this way.
To set the scene: the Quakers held a 28-25 lead, and the Crimson had the ball at Penn’s 10-yard line.
A play before, an eight-yard scramble by Hosch had forced Harvard coach Tim Murphy into a difficult choice: to attempt a field goal with sophomore kicker Kenny Smart, who had already missed an extra point, or to try to pick up a first down behind an offensive line that was without senior Anthony Fabiano, a three-year starter. Less than a minute remained in the quarter, and regardless of what Murphy chose, Harvard would start the fourth quarter with the breeze at its back.
“The bottom line is, we feel like we’re going to get the wind,” Murphy said. “We feel like our defense is playing well, and we’re going to be able to be in a one-score game.”
Ultimately Murphy’s decision was the more conservative one—to tie the game now with three points rather than risk a turnover on downs.
Except in this case, the reality didn’t work so smoothly. Penn freshman defensive back Jyron Walker broke through the line to block the kick, the Quakers recovered at the 20, and four plays later, wide receiver Justin Watson broke free for a 79-yard touchdown.
This whiplash change in fortunes gave Penn a two-possession lead at 35-25; the score would remain unchanged the rest of the way.
JUSTIN WATSON
In the Crimson’s previous eight games, exactly three players had topped 100 yards receiving, and none had reached 100 yards rushing.
On Saturday, Penn wide receiver Justin Watson achieved both feats.
By the end of the first quarter, the sophomore had already eclipsed 100 yards through the air, largely thanks to a 68-yard touchdown. That score came on a third-and-four with less than four minutes remaining, when Watson split the middle of the Harvard defense on a slant route.
Watson then reached a triple-digit rushing total at the start of the fourth quarter.
Earlier in the possession, a false start call on Watson, followed by a sack of Torgersen, had pushed the Quakers back for a second-and-21.
On the next play, though, Watson erased this yardage—and much more. As a squadron of blockers pushed Crimson defenders out of the way, he took a sweep handoff and made for the right sideline. Without anyone touching him, he turned the corner and accelerated the rest of the way for the score.
“It was really just get to the outside and run straight up,” Watson said. “[Senior wide receiver Cameron Countryman] pushed a guy all the way out to the sideline…. It’s all those guys.”

The Harvard women’s rugby team was part of history this weekend, participating in the first ever National Collegiate Women's Varsity Rugby Association Tournament. The tournament was the first of its kind, allowing only varsity and NCAA compliant teams to compete.
“It’s a huge honor to be able to play in this first inaugural varsity championship,” co-captain Hope Schwartz said. “It’s something that the Harvard athletic department was an integral part of organizing, so to be able to go and represent our school and our athletic department amongst the other varsity teams in the Northeast was a huge privilege.”
The tournament, many hope, will be the predecessor to fully integrating women’s rugby into the NCAA and establishing an official NCAA women’s rugby tournament.
Coming off a difficult pair of losses in the Ivy League tournament last week, the Crimson (4-5, 3-2 Ivy) looked to bounce back against an Army squad it faced three times last spring. Playing away at West Point, the Crimson tallied three tries but fell, 58-21.
Following last week’s tournament, Harvard came into the weekend with a depleted squad. Four of the Crimson’s starters were unable to play in Sunday’s matchup due to injury: senior Ann-Marie Barrett, junior Claire Collins, sophomore Sam Singal, and freshman Grace Chao.
Harvard would struggle early on, however, allowing three tries and a kick to give Army a 22-0 lead within the first ten minutes of the match before the Crimson could respond. In the 20th minute, and off a series of penalties, Harvard put itself on the scoreboard.
“Our first try that we scored was after a series of Army penalties and basically we responded in a very organized way and we worked together as a unit to decide what we were going to with the successive penalties,” Schwartz said. “[We] ended up getting up a lot of territory and eventually were able to just touch the ball into the try zone off a pick and go.”
Freshman Susie Clements would convert the kick to cut the lead to 15 at 22-7.
For head coach Sue Parker, the match was more than the shaky start and the loss. After a season of ups and downs, the team responded following the tough start to the match.
“All of the players on this team showed incredible mental resilience and pulled it together and actually fought back and the rest of the game was give and take and pretty even between the two teams,” Parker said.
Following the Crimson’s first try, both squads locked down on defense, with neither scoring for the next 20 minutes.
“We just really upped our intensity and aggression at the point of contact,” Parker said. “As soon as we started putting Army under pressure they started making mistakes.”
Nearing the end of the first half, the Knights made a late push into Harvard territory and managed to score a try and conversion to take a 29-7 lead at the half.
In the second half, the Crimson again faltered on defense, allowing four uncontested tries for 24 points. Again, Harvard would respond, as following big drives from Schwartz and freshman Virginia Miller, sophomore Haley Langan crossed the try line for the Crimson’s second try of the day. Clements would convert again to put the score at 53-14.
Building off the momentum of the last try, freshman Genevieve Quirion crossed the try line off the assist from sophomore Maya Learned to put the score at 53-19. Clements would convert for a third time to put the score at 53-21. Army would score in the closing minutes of the match to take the game 58-21.
Despite the loss, the last matchup of the season presented an important opportunity for the Harvard as the team heads into the spring 7’s season.
“I think one of the really interesting and fun opportunities this game presented was that because it was potentially going to be the last fifteen game of the season,” Schwartz said. “We knew that now was the time to try some of the stuff we’d been working on and we got to try a lot of new things during the game and we had new people in new positions and it was just really fun to play with that mentality.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Providence senior guard and projected NBA lottery pick Kris Dunn willed the host Friars (1-0) past Harvard (1-1), 76-64, Saturday night. Dunn was as good as advertised in every facet of the game as Providence outscored the Crimson 35-23 in the game’s final 14 minutes.
CHANGE OF PACE
Harvard went into the intermission down just five points mainly because of the hot shooting of freshman guard Corey Johnson and the team’s ability to keep Providence out of transition. The Friars’ offense revolves around Dunn and sophomore Rodney Bullock, a long, athletic wing who thrives in open space.
Providence shot only 34 percent from the field in the first half, made just two three-pointers, and went to the line eight times. Coach Tommy Amaker stuck wing Agunwa Okolie on Dunn for most of the first half and the senior was able to neutralize the Friars star for much of the first 20 minutes, utilizing his size advantage to shut down Dunn in the half court offense.
Amaker tinkered with a switch to zone defense, but it quickly led to an easy Ryan Fazekas three. The Crimson remained in man-to-man for the rest of the evening.
“We gotta get stops,” junior forward Zena Edosomwan said. “I think there were a lot of times where they just pushed the ball in transition, guy makes one move, and he’s at the basket. There’s a lot of like really easy baskets and we’re a better team than that.”
After Okolie picked up his second foul, junior Corbin Miller was tasked with covering Dunn. Known primarily as a three-point shooter, Miller was also able to hold Dunn in check, as the senior began the game by missing 12 of his first 15 shots.
As Harvard traded baskets and accumulated stops on defense, Providence struggled to score in its halfcourt sets. As the turnovers and personal fouls piled up and the Crimson’s jump shots stopped falling, the Friars were able to capitalize and convert in transition. Providence’s success in the open court allowed it to keep Harvard at arm’s length down the stretch. The hosts finished the game with 27 points off of turnovers.
GETTING IT DUNN
The Crimson learned Saturday why most NBA analysts project Kris Dunn as a top-10 pick in June’s NBA Draft. The senior poured in 32 points to lead all scorers and forced Harvard to alter its game plan on both ends of the floor.
Defensively, the New London, Conn. native forced freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy into a 2-for-13 shooting night and Amaker was reluctant to run the offense to Dunn’s side of the floor. The reigning Big East Defensive Player of the Year finished the game with eight steals to spearhead the Providence defense on a night in which it forced 22 Harvard turnovers.
“I was very impressed with his defense to be very honest,” Amaker said. “He’s strong, he’s quick, and he reads passing lanes so well. He is an outstanding player and we had 22 turnovers. The key for us to hang in there with him was not turning the ball over, it is kind of a pick-six opportunity.”
On the offensive end, Dunn’s ability to get to the rim put the Crimson big men and guards alike in foul trouble. Edosomwan picked up his third foul before halftime and McCarthy also finished the contest with four personals.
“I didn’t want to pick up that third foul,” Edosomwan said. “My first ten minutes I just told myself I didn’t want to pick up another foul so they had some certain baskets I kind of had to lay low a little and be careful so I couldn’t be as aggressive as I wanted to be in terms of defensively, but after that I was fine. Playing with three fouls, I just had to be really cautious.”
The Friars went to the line 21 times and Dunn’s penetration helped Providence finish the game with 42 points in the paint. The junior dished out six assists and turned the ball over just twice.
“He got to the foul line and knock[ed] down free throws,” Amaker said. “And then he start[ed] stepping back and made deep threes and jump shots and I’m not sure that anyone can guard him if he’s doing all that.”

Three pairs of aspiring Undergraduate Council leaders faced off at Saturday night’s “UC-Crimson Crossfire” debate, but just one duo looked ready to fight.
Nick E. Gajdzik ’17 and Jeffrey M. Ott ’17 donned spandex wrestling uniforms under blazers—an unconventional sporty professional look—for the hotly contested debate, unabashedly positioning themselves for a takedown.
During the portion of the debate when candidates could ask questions of their opponents, Gajdzik and Ott made unexpected jabs at their competitors.
First, the pair challenged Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 to a game of sudden death “water pong,” a variant of beer pong where the red solo cups are filled with water. To cheers from the audience, the teams threw ping pong balls across the stage until Crimson moderators deemed the time for shenanigans up. The debate resumed.
But Gajdzik and Ott were not ready to time out for the evening. When they got the chance to ask a question of their other competitors—William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17—they pulled another quick one. Ott challenged Greenlaw, who Ott said is known for frequently hitting the gym, to a push-up contest.
As Ott and Greenlaw took their positions on the carpeted Harvard Hall floor, the crowd rose to watch the unexpected showdown.
After one minute of vigorous tricep pumping, Ott was victorious with 80 push-ups, crushing Greenlaw’s 49.
Gajdzik and Ott will know if their diversion tactics during the debate were successful when the winners of the UC election are announced on Nov. 19.

Here at Harvard, we are taught by some of the best professors in the world, lucky enough to be surrounded by some of the hardest working and most engaged students. We are getting ready to become productive members of society, to make a difference as leaders. Some of us will go into public service, some into medicine, and many will work in finance or consulting. But, as much as we love it here, life at Harvard doesn’t always translate well for the real world in so many ways.
1) Not all food is unlimited
As much as we critique the interesting options HUDS provides, it is always useful to be able to go back for more when needed. Unfortunately, back in the real world, not all food is served in the buffet style that we live on. As much as we love covering our trays (if we use them) with Red Spiced Chicken, Cuban Sandwiches and bowls of TomBasRav, once outside the bubble, most dinners probably won’t provide the Freshman 15 experience you can get with a swipe.
2) Non- HUDS late night food doesn’t always mean burritos and burgers
It may be confusing to think, but when some folks are hungry, they don’t immediately decide between Tasty or Felipe’s. Depending on where you go, you can have more or less places to eat at 3 a.m. in the morning after a long night of.. studying.
In fact, some people also cook for themselves with their own kitchen (which is uncommon if you don’t live in DeWolfe). In real life, not everything has to be fast food, or made in a kitchen which you share with at least 10 other people.
3) Not everywhere runs on Harvard Time
At this point of the year, being seven minutes late to class and other Harvard events is more than a guideline. It is a way of life. However natural it may feel now due to the Harvard way of life, showing up seven minutes late to everything else is going to land you in hot water with just about everyone, whether it is future jobs, dates, or family meetings. And they definitely won’t appreciate it if you try to tell them it’s just a Harvard thing.
4) Not everyone gets the Harvard slang you know
Being at Harvard introduces to a whole new world of vocabulary, just when you thought just dropping the “H word" was elitist enough. Despite our hope that everyone will always understand us when we talk about life in Cambridge, mentioning terms and phrases like “getting Quadded,” “comping,” and “punching,” you’re more likely to get blank faces.
For example, we have concentrations here, not majors. We have secondaries, not minors. You know how pretentious it makes you feel, but you always have to pause when someone asks you what your major is, and you have to make a judgement call on whether or not to correct them.

It’s that most wonderful time of year again: The Game is upon us. You’ve bought your tickets, luckily found which buses, trains or automobiles you’ll be taking, and have barely figured out where you’re going to stay. Time and time again, we’ve beaten them at football, and now it’s time for Harvard students to once again dominate on and off the field.
So it’s also time for us to be winning at the fashion game as well. Those who were at Harvard for the Game last year know how cold it was, and this year’s weather forecast does not seem much different. Sometimes it’s tricky to couple being warm with looking in style for all of those Instagram posts and Snaps (using cellular data since the Wifi at the Stadium is not the best). So what should you rock at New Haven to show those Yalies what’s good?
Harvard-Yale T-Shirts
You’ve been getting emails for the past week or so about these shirts. The Crimson Dance Team, Global Medical Brigades, and others have been selling t-shirts with killer slogans to help get everyone excited. Definitely buy one of these! Wear a layer underneath (or maybe two) as they are the key to staying warm. Maybe bring an extra shirt just in case the first gets messed up during the tailgate and you don’t want to go back all the way to Yale campus from the Stadium.
H Sweaters
Your mailboxes have also been filled with emails about the approaching deadline for ordering the classic H sweater. Why not wear this while cheering in the bleachers? These are not only perfect to show school pride at the Game, but they are perfect to wear throughout the very long, very cold Cambridge winter.
Bean Boots
You can’t storm the field without some solid footwear that will keep your feet warm. Bean Boots are a must-have, and paired with a pair (or two) of thick, woolly socks.
Disclaimer: It’s probably too late to purchase them in time for the Game, in part due to the notorious back order. If you don’t have them already, getting an alternative is always fine. Boat shoes may not be the best choice but do what you think is best.
Headwear
As the famous Troy Bolton once said, “You got to get your head in the game!” Keeping it warm is always important. Your standard Harvard cap or beanie is an always welcome additon. Remember to pick it up after you throw it in the field after Harvard scores a touchdown.
In addition to these staples, a nice, heavy coat, fuzzy mittens and yes, pants are always a plus as you cheer in the stands. And remember to avoid wearing that not-so-attractive shade of blue! Have a fun, safe, and stylish Harvard-Yale experience, everyone.

The campus is alive with election frenzy as the Undergraduate Council’s presidential race nears its end. Here at Flyby, we’ve heard a ton from the candidates about what they want to do if they are elected, but they still haven’t gotten around to asking us what we want. Well, here you go– we even put it in a neat list for you:
Introduce legislation to make Roxy’s Grilled Cheese a permanent addition to the Science Center PlazaCherry Lemonade is a must, even though the temperatures are quickly turning arctic. Without it, the world is cold and devoid of color. Seriously. Roxy’s is a necessity for student mental health, so any UC presidential ticket should make this a priority.
Relax book check requirements at LamontThere’s nothing normal about how vigorously the Lamont security guards check every crevice of a backpack for stolen book materials. There’s not a single book we can think of that will fit in the small zipper pocket at the very front of our bag. We swear.
MORE COFFEEThis is a no-brainer. Coffee machines should literally be affixed to every surface. How else do you expect us to make it through our three-hour evening section?
Subsidies (looking at you, Ec10) for better (and safer) drinksAlthough turning Harvard alumni money into party subsidies don't necessarily seem like it would be President Faust's number one priority, surely Harvard can afford to provide something other than the go-to bottle of cheap Rubinoff Vodka (by this we mean orange juice and water, of course) at its Saturday night sweat-fests? Get on that, UC. We need champagne to celebrate the end of a stressful week.
Ban MondaysSpeaking of stressful weeks, why hasn’t the Undergraduate Council thought to address the most obvious policy change: Monday classes. Specifically, those pesky 9 a.m. language classes. If we’re going to be forced to drag myself ourselves out of bed on a dreary Monday, the least the college could do is make sure we don’t have to do so until a reasonable time.
These are real, substantive issues! Flyby believes in the potential for these changes, and hopes that the UC candidates will too.

Mother Nature has rightfully respected the Scooter Hustle this Fall and I feel truly #blessed. Had it not been for the beautiful weather these past few months, I would have already spent my entire life savings on one-mile Uber rides, and thus would have never fallen in love with my Razor A5 LUX Kick Scooter, and thus would have never maximized my glute and quadricep game.
Scootering on Harvard’s beloved campus is something of a beautiful phenomenon. Just a few years ago I may have questioned the sanity of a passerby riding his scooter up the cobblestones of DeWolfe Street, but today I smile admirably at my fellow scooterers, knowing full well that we would make great friends. There are more and more Harvardians whipping out their Razors (or Yaaks) past the Science Center by the day, each with their own wonderfully unique perspective on Scootering at Harvard. Some scooter for the convenience, others scooter for the accessibility, and a select few (myself included) scooter because the shuttle just doesn’t come around often enough.
Every scooterer has a story that deserves to be heard. Learn from five Scooterers of Harvard about what scooters they rep, their best/worst scootering spots, their worst scootering injuries, and how to “to ignore the haters and just keep on scooting.”
Scooter of preference: Razor A5– red
Flyby: Worst injury?RLB: I was on the way back from MIT from some event and I totally just wiped out. I think I was on the street and saw a car coming so I tried to get on the sidewalk and I didn’t make the angle steep enough so I grazed against it. Because my hands were on the handlebar, I fell forward and my face actually hit the pavement. My chest absorbed most of it, but my face hit the pavement and my hands were under so they couldn’t do anything. Then I got a bloody nose, so that was the worst of it. So that was probably the worst I’ve had– a bloody nose and some scraped up palms, which is really not that bad.
Flyby: Best scootering spot?RLB: The downhill on the street over from UHS is pretty great. That one is really good because you can come right out of one of the Harvard gates from the Yard and you go down that street, and then you take a very slight right and you coast across two lanes and then right up the street to Lowell gate. Lowell gate is on an uphill, but you’re going so fast that you don’t even notice. So that’s a fun one.
Flyby: Worst scootering spot?RLB: I mean, a lot of them. The cobblestones are pretty awful– the bricks and whatnot. The Common actually, if you’re going up to the Quad and you decide to cut through the long stretch of pavement in the Cambridge Commons and not on the sidewalk, the pavement there is so bad. They’re redoing it now. There were just so many cracks big enough that you would go over it and get stuck.
Flyby: Any special scooter moments?RLB: About two weekends ago, I was over at a different event down at MIT and I scootered over there and then my friends decided to come. When we were headed back to the dorm, my friends took the T and I wanted to save a few bucks and didn’t want to take the scooter on the T and whatever, so I just scootered back. I actually beat them and got dressed into relaxed clothes, because I was dressed up for the event, and used to bathroom and everything before they got back from the T. And I didn’t think I was going insanely fast, I guess the T was a little slow. It does save time and it saved me like 5 bucks that night. I got pretty sweaty, particularly in a suit, but yeah it’s pretty fast.
Scooter of preference: Small Razor or Yaak
Flyby: How long have you been scootering?AMP: I’d like to say I started scootering 6 to 8 weeks ago. It was right at the beginning of the year. So basically it started because my blockmate got a bike and we have class Tuesday and Thursday together up by Pierce, which is kind of far from Dunster...and I was like I can’t run next to you or trot awkwardly so he was like, "You can use my scooter" and I was like, "Sure, sounds good." So it started off as a Tuesday-Thursday kind of thing. Like he would bike and I would scooter. Still looked kind of weird doing it.
Flyby: Best scooter spot?AMP: Best spot hands-down is down Mount Auburn. It starts all the way up at the Fox, then you just cruise all the way down by Lowell and the garden, then you gotta get into the bike lane by Quincy. It’s just bliss. Or going down Lamont hill, also known as "Lamontimanjaro." It’s fun, but also kind of scary considering you’re going straight towards an intersection, whereas at least going down Mount Auburn, you just cruise.
Flyby: Do you feel super cool when you scooter past people?AMP: Well sometimes I get random comments, like if it’s 10:06 and I’m on a scooter going to class and there are people walking I’ve gotten comments like, "Ugh, I wish I had your scooter," because they’re late to class and I’m only gonna be a little late to class. Then if I’m passing someone I know peripherally, everyone is always happier to see you when you’re on a scooter. You get comments like, "Nice scooter’ or "I like your Razor." Then you get the haters. I’m gonna go with the majority of my inner circle hates the scooter. I’ve gotten some derogatory things yelled at me like, ‘You look like a loser.’ Also sometimes if you’re passing a cute boy, you’re not sure if he’s gonna think, ‘"Wow, she’s really cool on a scooter,” or if he’s gonna think, "Why is this weirdo on a scooter?" You know? It’s kind of a tossup.
Scooter of preference: Red Razor A5
Flyby: How many people have you almost scootered into?CJF: I haven’t actually hit anyone, but there was one pretty close call. So I was coming down the hill by Adams and The Crimson and it was raining and this guy was walking down and I saw his umbrella and I was like, "Oh shoot." I hit the umbrella, but luckily I didn’t hit him. He was kind of holding the umbrella out in front of him and I kind of flipped it with my head. Besides that, I haven’t really hit anyone.
Flyby: How many cars have you almost scootered into?CJF: Uh, really only one, and this is really my only scootering accident. So I was scootering down DeWolfe Street the wrong way and a car started coming so I go to the side, and I’m trying to get on the curb, but it was covered by leaves so I flipped over the curb. I took a decent chunk of my knee with that fall.
Flyby: Best scooter spot?CJF: The best scootering route is from the Science Center down to Lev at nighttime, because there’s no foot traffic and it’s downhill. So I can get there in 2 and a half minutes about. That’s my favorite. I go through Tercentenary Theater, out Widener Gate, down [Plympton Street], past Mt. Auburn, and then I’ll either turn and go down DeWolfe or I’ll go straight and take a left to Lev.
Flyby: Do you feel super cool when you scooter past people?CJF: I don’t know if I feel super cool, but I feel like it takes a certain type of confidence to ride a scooter, because a lot of people kind of mess with you about riding a scooter. You see people even making fun of it on Yik Yak and stuff like that, but you have to ignore the haters and just keep on scooting. I don’t necessarily feel cool, but I also don’t feel like a "loser." It’s really convenient, so I think it’s worth it.
Scooter of preference: Razor A5 Lux Kick Scooter
Flyby: How many people have you scootered into?GTS: Honestly, too many to count…people really don’t pay attention when they walk sometimes.
Flyby: Worst scootering spots?GTS: The worst are right in front of the John Harvard Statue, the Science Center Plaza, especially during peak lunch hours, and the sidewalks along JFK. Also trying to scooter over the bridge is more taxing than it would seem.
Flyby: Do you have any special scooter moments?GTS: Anytime I scooter past a proctor or tutor’s child who is also on a scooter always makes me feel great.
Scooter of preference: Small, blue Razor
Flyby: Worst injury?WSX: I haven’t had any bad injuries, but with a scooter you never know what’s going to pop up in front of you, like a little curb, and then you flip. Especially at night. I bring my scooter with me essentially everywhere I go– when I go to New York and when I go to San Francisco, I like to bring the scooter along with me. You can fly with it– you can check it in and everything. In San Francisco one time, it was nighttime and I was scootering really fast, and this was right when I got my scooter, so I was trying to clock how fast I could go on it. So I was going and going and then I flipped over a little curb and I completely ate the dirt. I scraped my knees, but nothing really bad.
Flyby: Any special scooter moments?WSX: I love just like sometimes when you’re scootering and someone’s like, "Oh yo I used to do that when I was like 7. I used to do tricks and stuff!" Then they take your scooter and try to do something cool with it. So that’s always fun. Also, all the moments in which I get some hatred. Those are pretty special and interesting.
Happy scootering, Harvard.
