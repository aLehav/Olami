After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week was a week of silence and noise. Marathon Monday was pandemonium. Multiple blasts plunged the city into panic, countless sirens careened down the streets of Boston, airwaves filled with concerned calls to loved ones, and updates from news networks and police departments saturated our Twitter feeds. Yet, a hush fell over some parts of that day, as many of us found ourselves too shocked and confused to produce the right words. Such is tragedy: It generates an odd combination of disarray and paralysis.
The contrast between quiet and chaos continued as the hellish week stretched on. On Thursday night, my roommates and I stood glued to our window in Wigglesworth as approximately thirty screaming police cars sped past us on Massachusetts Avenue. The next day, a citywide lockdown brought with it empty streets, closed stores, and eerie silence.
Thankfully, I can set a few moments from last week apart from the dichotomy. The chatty, convivial atmosphere on Friday afternoon in Harvard Yard stands out the most. Last Friday was the warmest day of the year thus far, and when I emerged from Annenberg with some friends, we walked back through the yard and saw a solid portion of the freshman class playing games in the grass and enjoying the beautiful weather. We wanted to join in on the fun, so we played touch football and brought blankets out so we could lie down and absorb the warmth of the spring air.
The freshmen in the yard were not ignoring the gravity of current events or pretending that everything was okay. Some of us periodically checked the news on our smart phones. Many of us voiced our anxieties and fears. We did not play in the yard out of ignorance; Instead, we were all acutely aware that what we craved on a scary day like Friday was the company of friends and the spirit of community. There is an intense healing power in companionship.
Throughout this year, I was always concerned about taking enough alone time. I worried that I would lose parts of myself amidst all of the stress and buzz here on campus. I consider myself to be a naturally social person, but I felt the need to prescribe myself chunks of personal time to combat all of the overstimulation I associated with college life. After all, I thought living constantly surrounded by others could not be natural or healthy. In my mind, this assumption no longer holds. Last week’s events led me to the realization that my convictions about personal space were patently false. We all need some “me” time now and then, but quiet is not what I am missing here at school. I need to be engaging even more with those around me. Balance means not only taking time for oneself but also taking time to be human. We really can derive so much strength from each other, and it is a shame not to tap into the power source that sincere communication and time spent with others can provide.
What made playing in Harvard Yard on Friday so important was that it was a true moment of connection for my friends and me. Not once did anyone mention schoolwork. There was no talk of academic stress or extracurricular overload. Instead, we spent our time that afternoon simply being people together. Were we right to ignore the stay-indoors request? The answer is unclear. However, I can say with certainty that there was a magical quality to my Friday afternoon, and we could all use infinitely more of that kind of enriching human interaction in our lives.
One of my beloved roommates always talks about the scientific power of human touch. She rightfully insists that simple acts like handholding and pats on the back can be essential to one’s wellbeing. I experienced this power when I attended Memorial Church service on Sunday morning. I am not particularly religious, but I was especially touched, both physically and emotionally, during one portion of the service. We “passed the peace,” which meant that we embraced or shook hands with those around us and shared the words “Peace be with you.” Indeed, the physical acts of hugs and handshakes were beneficial, and the loving intention behind them was even more heart-warming. Once again, I felt the benefit of human connection that I had previously undervalued.
So, while the end of April may be a little late in the year for resolution making, I have committed to spread my human touch around a little bit more. This doesn’t mean that I am going to go around campus giving people massages (you can ask my roommate for those), but it certainly does mean that I am going to recommit to connection. So, while it might be more convenient to text, I am going to make sure that I call my loved ones so we can hear each other’s voices. And maybe I’ll send more letters so that my friends can see the endearing quality of my atrociously messy handwriting and know that I care about them. And maybe, when I’m having conversations here at school, I’ll try to make sure we talk less about our homework and more about our dreams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, just minutes before Harvard announced the cancellation of Visitas, we sent to press a staff editorial welcoming admitted students and urging them to explore Harvard’s many offerings during a fun-filled weekend of programming. Needless to say, some of the content of our editorial seemed a bit incompatible with Friday’s unprecedented city-wide lockdown and manhunt. Nevertheless, we are undaunted in our conviction that Harvard offers an incomparable educational experience and one-of-a-kind intellectual community. More importantly, we believe that the response of Harvard and the Boston community to the bombing and resulting manhunt demonstrate qualities of both the school and wider area that ought to make coming to Cambridge even more attractive than before.
Without a doubt, the marathon bombings, the shooting of an MIT police officer, and a day-long lockdown and manhunt made last week a tense time for the Harvard and Boston communities. But the city’s response to these events displayed competence, dedication, and resilience. The Boston Police Department mobilized in an impressive display of organization and force to find bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Their communication with both federal authorities and local citizens was effective and comforting. Residents of Boston also exhibited their solidarity and commitment to safety by cooperating with a lockdown and stay-indoors request. Here on campus, Securitas and the Harvard University Police Department dedicated themselves to our safety, Harvard University Dining Services staff braved danger to come to work, and housemasters, tutors, and proctors reached out to students and demonstrated their care for our wellbeing.
The student response at Harvard also demonstrates the strength of this community. Students at Harvard Kennedy School and at the College organized candlelight vigils to honor victims of the marathon bombings. And in response to Harvard’s cancellation of Visitas, the hashtag #VirtualVisitas immediately trended on Twitter as Harvard students, affiliates, and alumni felt compelled to reach out to admitted students who would no longer have the opportunity to visit. On their own initiative, students like those in freshman dorms Holworthy and Wigglesworth created videos to share their love of Harvard with those who had been denied the Visitas experience. On the official side of things, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 and the rest of Harvard College Admissions made sure to reach out to the admitted students stranded at Boston Logan Airport on Friday and to other prefrosh in the midst of their journeys to Visitas, even providing the former group with accommodations at a local hotel.
Surveys of crime rates and safety statistics have ranked Boston and Cambridge among the safest cities in America, but these numbers are just part of a much larger picture. What is more important is that students here find comfort in those less quantitative measures that display the remarkable quality of this community. The way in which Harvard united in the face of terror confirms that this is a place worth choosing. We hope that the events of last week and the cancellation of Visitas have not discouraged admitted students from considering Harvard as they weigh options for next year—last week made us even more grateful that this is the place where we decided to spend our college years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friday, as daily life in Boston and surrounding neighborhoods all but ground to a halt in the midst of a massive manhunt for the so-called Marathon bomber, the nation sent suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev a message: “You blew up our children, gunned down our officers, and terrorized our city. You won’t get away with it. This is war.” But was it?
In the wake of Tsarnaev’s arrest, the government found itself in a quandary. Should Tsarnaev face judgment in a domestic court with the associated protections enshrined in Article III of the Constitution, or should he wait indefinitely in military detention without access to a lawyer or trial? The answer to this question hinged on whether Tsarnaev counted as a criminal or as an enemy combatant, a once crystal-clear distinction that has become increasingly murky as the definition of war has expanded.
The 26.2-mile test of physical ability and mental willpower in which around 30 thousand runners competed last week earned its name from the ancient Greek Battle of Marathon, after which a lone messenger sprinted and stumbled that daunting distance to announce victory to his leaders. The Battle of Marathon of 490 B.C. pitted two disciplined armies against each other, and each other alone, in a specific place at a specific time—with accepted guidelines demarcating permissible conduct. 2013’s battle of marathon, on the other hand, saw no marching lines, no uniforms, and no rules.
The 2013 battle of marathon helps illustrate a troubling truth about war in today’s world. Although the United States still sends troops overseas to engage in clear-cut conflicts against specific countries, citizens here know all too well that we also wage a war on terror. Our opponents in Al Qaeda embrace a modern style of warfare where operatives clad in whatever they choose carry out violence on our turf and against our civilians. Al Qaeda’s attacks meet the definition of acts of war, but when they target citizens in the homeland, they also meet the definition of plain, old domestic crime.
The debate over whether to treat a foreign terrorist associated with Al Qaeda as an enemy combatant, and try him in a military court—or as a simple criminal, and try him in an Article III court—has no easy legal answer. Tsarnaev’s case does. For one thing, though all terrorism is terrible, not all terrorism is war. No compelling evidence suggests Tsarnaev has any connection to Al Qaeda or related forces with whom the U.S. is currently fighting in an armed conflict. (Perhaps shockingly to some, including a few members of Congress, his Muslim background does not suffice.)
What’s more, Tsarnaev became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September of 2012, which means that he has a right to the heightened protections the Constitution affords all citizens, protections like due process of law. Monday’s decision to prosecute Tsarnaev through the civilian judicial system, then, was a no-brainer. In doing otherwise, the government would have violated our nation’s founding document.
However, even in cases concerning alleged terrorists with undeniable ties to Al Qaeda and permanent ties to the U.S., the government should bring the accused to trial in Article III courts when it can feasibly do so. National security concerns may sometimes require trials of foreign terrorists to take place in military commissions. But Article III courts have garnered international recognition not only for their fairness but also for their impressive track record in cases of terrorism.
Although military commissions have undergone considerable reform in recent years, they still fall short compared to civilian tribunals in procedural protections that safeguard the rights of the prosecuted. For example, military courts will admit into evidence statements made in the absence of Miranda warnings, as long as the judge finds those statements reliable and voluntary. What’s more, terrorism defendants in military courts are not assured speedy trials, and officials presiding over those courts have broad leeway to close proceedings to the public. Perhaps most importantly, a military commission can deliver a guilty verdict on non-capital offenses with only a two-thirds vote rather than unanimity.
If the U.S. has the opportunity to try terrorists in its own courts with successful results and without jeopardizing the safety of its citizens, it ought to. Making that choice would demonstrate our government’s faith in the efficacy and integrity of its judiciary.
Today, the world is a battlefield, and one where anything can happen to anyone—a trained Marine aiming a rifle at enemies in Afghanistan, fully aware of the danger that surrounds him, or an eight-year-old child cheering on his father in a race, confident in his safety until a backpack explodes at his feet. The United States should strive to preserve some modicum of justice in an age where little else remains sacred.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a press conference last Wednesday, President Obama was visibly angry with the Senate for failing to advance several controversial gun control measures.  The Senate did not pass amendments to mandate background checks on all gun buyers, extend the assault weapons ban, and restrict the capacity of ammunition magazines.  The President spent much of the conference blaming the National Rifle Association and special interests for foiling the bill.  However, the force hindering meaningful arms control legislation in this country is not limited to a few groups.
The real problem with gun control in America is that it is viewed as a sacred cow.  Diehard defenders of the second amendment want to portray gun rights as a black and white issue. A meme shared on Mitch McConnell’s Facebook page after the Senate voted down the measures showed McConnell forming a zero with his fingers; the caption read, “You can have this much gun control,”  This type of reaction illustrates the popular view: You’re either for guns, or you’re against them.  It’s not that simple.
Opponents of gun regulation feel that any restriction is too much restriction.  The NRA recently ran an advertisement that paints the issue in stark terms by referring to the Senate proposals as “Obama’s gun ban.”  Even limits on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons that serve no purpose for hunting or home defense are unpalatable—these are viewed as the first steps down a slippery slope.  Some worry that this slope leads to further erosion of gun rights.  The most extreme believe that it will lead to tyrannical government power over a citizenry that cannot arm itself against an authoritarian regime.  I do not lose any sleep over such an unlikely prospect, but fears of government overreach should not be ignored.  The problem is: If there is a slippery slope, we have already started down it.
To understand the problem with this “first edge of the wedge” theory, we need to look at gun rights in the larger context of weapons regulation.  Guns are only one type of instrument on a continuum of items that have applications for recreation or self-defense, but also the potential to be wielded in an attack.  Kitchen knives and baseball bats have been used as murder weapons, but are widely recognized as having practical and recreational utility that outweighs their potential to be used in a crime.
On the other end of the continuum, restrictions on many classes of weaponry already exist and go unquestioned in America.  Never in our history have civilians owned fighter planes, warships, or armored tanks, in spite of the strong deterrence they could provide to would-be burglars.  In between the extremes, we have already drawn a line.  There is no reason to think that different guns cannot fall on different sides of the line.
Today, as has been the case for a long time, if the U.S. government seriously wanted to impose its will on the people through force, all the assault rifles in the world would be of no use.   During his recent filibuster, Rand Paul called for restrictions on the government’s use of drones. To extend this argument along the NRA’s line of logic, perhaps he should have pushed to let citizens line up to buy their own for self-defense.  Ever since we left the musket era, the government has wielded weapons of increasingly greater power than any that have ever been owned by civilians. If there is a line in the sand, we crossed it long ago.
What remains for us to decide is where we want to strike the balance between our right to arms for self-defense, and our right not to live in fear that our hometown will be the next Newtown.  This should be a civilized debate, because both rights deserve protection, but neither is likely to be fulfilled for all people in all cases.  Fortunately, the two are not mutually exclusive, and a little common sense can go a long way in maximizing both.  Owning a shotgun for home defense makes sense.  Requiring a semi-automatic assault rifle with a 50-round magazine for hunting game does not.  Furthermore, the AR-15 (the semi-automatic assault rifle used in several recent mass shootings including Newtown), in spite of all the harm it can inflict on defenseless victims in an attack, would be no match for the power of a coercive militaristic government bent on overpowering its citizens.
The current discourse in Washington is muddled by the misconception that the right to bear arms is a sacred one that cannot be touched. Arguments that suggest there can be no middle ground on complex issues are tempting because they are easy to grasp, and are frequently used to oversimplify disputes for political gain.  George W. Bush framed the war on terror in similarly uncompromising terms: “You’re either with us, or against us.”
Once we realize that the sanctity of gun rights exists only in the imagination, maybe we will take a more rational approach to the issue. I hope that Congress will eventually decide that the Second Amendment is absolutely deserving of staunch protection, but should not be used to compromise (as The New Yorker’s Andy Borowitz put it) our equally important right not to get shot.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Experiment Fund, the Harvard-affiliated seed-stage investment fund launched January of 2012, held its inaugural Experimenter Assembly in Kirkland Junior Common Room on Wednesday afternoon. During the public event, partners of the fund reflected on the organization’s first year of operations and celebrated its considerable progress thus far.
The fund has invested in start-ups such as Tivli, an online TV streaming company founded by Harvard College alumni, and Zumper, an online apartment rental platform founded by Harvard Business School alumni.
In an interview before the event, W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a former Crimson editorial and business editor and current partner of the fund, said that the Fund seeks to establish lasting infrastructure to nurture innovation at Harvard and the surrounding community. The leaders of the fund, he said, are “passionate about catalyzing student ideas.”
Van Vuuren and fellow partner Patrick S. Chung ’96, a former Crimson editorial chair, emphasized that the fund seeks to integrate itself into the Harvard community, drawing on the talents of students, faculty, and venture capitalists across generations.
During the Assembly, Chung presented computer science lecturer David J. Malan ’99 with the first annual Experimenter Award, recognizing his innovative work in education. Malan, teaches the popular introductory class Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” as well as CS50x, a massive open online course modeled after CS50 that was launched last fall.
In an interview with The Crimson after the event, Malan emphasized the importance of online education in supplementing traditional pedagogical methods.
“I think the trend towards online courses is just an opportunity to factor out of a traditional classroom material that was probably never best suited for a lecture format, particularly complex material,” he said.
Peter A. Boyce ’13, who attended the event, said he was impressed by the fund.
“I think it represents students, venture capitalists, and professors all coming together to support technology and entrepreneurship,” he said. “I think it’s been phenomenal to see all the work that the Experiment Fund has done in just a year’s time.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: April 26, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the Experiment Fund partner who presented the first annual Experimenter Award to computer science lecturer David J. Malan ’99. In fact, Patrick S. Chung ‘96, not W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, presented the award. In addition, an earlier version of the photo accompanying this story misidentified its subject. In fact, W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, not James W. Breyer, is pictured introducing the Experiment Fund.

In the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, many Harvard Square restaurants and businesses are donating portions of their sales to help victims of the attacks.
“Anything that we could do in some small way to help the victims was something that we felt strongly about,” said Patrick M. Lee, a partner with The Grafton Group, whose restaurants PARK, Russell House Tavern, Grafton Street, and Temple Bar all participated in fundraising.
Several Harvard Square restaurants, including Harvest and Café Sushi, signed on with The Greg Hill Foundation to donate a portion of their sales to the victims of the bombings. The Charles Hotel’s restaurants, Rialto and Henrietta’s Table, will also donate one percent of their revenue during the month of May to “The One Fund,” a campaign established by Massachusetts Governor Deval L. Patrick ’78 and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino to help those most affected by the attack.
In addition to raising funds individually, businesses are uniting for a fundraiser for Cambridge residents and newlyweds Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, who both lost the lower part of their left legs as a result of the explosion.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the HSBA, said that Councilor David P. Maher contacted her to help raise awareness for the online fundraising campaign created by friends of the couple through GiveForward. Jillson said that when she went to the campaign’s website, she saw a photo of Downes and Kensky, holding hands as they walked past Harvard Square’s Holyoke Center.
“It really broke my heart,” she said. “They were just so beautiful and looking so much in love and carefree, and I thought that we can’t just help get the word out, we need to do something.”
Jillson set up an auction to raise additional money for the couple, garnering immediate donations from local businesses, including Toscano, Maharaja, Dado Tea, and Rebekah Brooks.
“The outpouring of support and kindness and generosity is so touching and so moving that I could just cry,” Jillson added. “The auction and the raffle have almost become an event within the event.”
The Charles Hotel is donating a one-night stay and dinner for two as the grand prize for the raffle. The Charles’ Public Relations and Marketing Coordinator Ariana Ducas said that many of the hotel’s employees attended or ran in the marathon, while others live in the Watertown area that witnessed the bulk of Friday’s manhunt for the bombing suspect.
“I think it’s encouraging for people to see that all of these businesses are coming together,” Ducas said.

University President Drew G. Faust, Reverend Johnathan L. Walton, and other members of the Harvard community gathered outside Memorial Church on Wednesday to inaugurate Harvard’s newest common space, “The Porch.”
Located on the steps of Memorial Church facing Tercentenary Theatre, The Porch features new benches and seating open for students and community members. The space is a part of Harvard’s Common Spaces Initiative and the product of a collaboration between the church and Harvard’s Event Management Office. Organizers say the goal of the space is to provide community members a break from the regimented structure of daily life.
Vice President for Campus Services Lisa Hogarty said that the site is envisioned to play a role in the community beyond Convocation and Commencement, perhaps hosting additional events such as poetry readings.
“Because of [The Porch’s] location in the middle of the yard, it knits together all the common spaces that we’ve created” Hogarty said. She added that she hoped the space would provide a place “where people can come and reflect and feel completely welcome.”
Michael E. Danto ’13, who attended the event, said he thinks having a common space central to campus will create unity among students.
“I think it’ll be drawing the community together,” said Danto, who is also an inactive Crimson photo editor. “It’s one thing to be walking across Tercentenary Theatre to go to class, but it’s quite another to have people sort of sitting and relaxing, and sort of staying in place and being with each other,” he added.
The Common Spaces Initiative—introduced by Faust in 2008—aims to develop parts of campus in order to facilitate community and interaction for students and faculty.
At the event, Faust said the Boston Marathon bombings demonstrated the “force, strength, and necessity” of a strong Harvard community, adding that common spaces are important to foster cohesion.
Acknowledging The Porch’s location at the steps of Memorial Church, Walton said he hopes the space will serve as “a space of grace for all people.”
“The Porch is not looking to be anything more than what it is—a place to share, a place to care, a place to give, and a place just simply, to live,” Walton said. “But most importantly, The Porch is just a place to belong.”

In a new study published last March in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Harvard researchers reveal that even a single incident of malnutrition in early childhood can have a profound effect on an individual’s adult personality. Individuals who had suffered from severe starvation as infants tended to be more neurotic and less adventurous, sociable, curious, and organized as adults.
The study monitored the growth and development of a group of 77 children who had been hospitalized due to malnutrition within the first year of life and a group of 57 healthy controls from the same neighborhoods and socioeconomic backgrounds. When they reached the age of 40, the personalities of the study’s participants were evaluated for five main traits: neuroticism, extroversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.
Though the individuals monitored had only suffered from malnutrition for only a short period very early on, the study still found striking differences between the previously malnourished individuals and the control group. The profiles of previously malnourished individuals were five times as likely to indicate neurotic personalities as their healthy counterparts and three times as likely to exhibit low levels of extroversion and conscientiousness. Individuals who hadn’t suffered from malnutrition were five times more likely to have high scores for openness.
According to Janina R. Galler, lead author and psychiatry professor at Harvard Medical School, the results were shocking.
“These personality profiles suggest that these people may have mental health issues at this point in their life,” said Galler.
Though the exact biological connection between childhood malnutrition and adult personality remains a mystery, the research team suspects that childhood malnutrition may limit the production of important proteins and nutrients crucial for the normal development of the brain during early childhood.
Galler said that the effects of childhood malnutrition on personality may extend even to the next generation. In parallel animal studies, the research team found that both animals who had suffered from malnutrition in childhood and their offspring suffered personality impairments. The researchers hope to study the personalities of the children of the original study participants to evaluate if the same trans-generational effect is present in humans.
According to Galler, the study suggests that intervention programs which provide proper nutrition to malnourished children cannout guarantee their future mental health.
“What it means is that there is really no quick fix for early malnutrition,” said Galler, “We really have to think much more broadly in terms of how public health policies dealing with malnutrition should be crafted.”

Joshua P. Zoffer ’14 and Ben D. Sprung-Keyser ’15 were named the youngest team champions in the history of the American Parliamentary Debate Association’s national tournament on Sunday, marking the second consecutive year that a Harvard team has won the tournament.
Zoffer and Sprung-Keyser, members of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society, defeated a team from Syracuse in the tournament’s final round by a judge’s vote of 5 to 2.
“It’s incredible,” Zoffer said of the championship win. “We had some idea coming in that we had a chance to do really well, and we certainly didn’t think it was impossible that we would win, but we definitely were not expecting it.”
Sprung-Keyser echoed Zoffer’s sentiment, adding that “[they are] extraordinarily proud to represent Harvard while winning.”
Zoffer and Sprung-Keyser participated in several rounds of competition throughout the weekend at the University of Maryland, College Park.
Each round is debated two-on-two, and the pairs of competitors that speak first choose the topic of debate. In the final round, Zoffer and Sprung-Keyser chose to speak on whether or not the U.S. should break up big banks.
Zoffer said that the final round inspired a new sense of focus and determination.
“At the start of the tournament, getting to the final round seems incredible, and you say to yourself, ‘I would be really happy just to be in the final round,’” Zoffer said. “As soon as you are in that round, your expectations totally change, and then suddenly, coming in second no longer feels like an acceptable option.”
Zoffer and Sprung-Keyser prepared for nationals by writing up the cases, or topics of debate, they would choose to speak on during the tournament. Though they were not partners for most of the year, both competed throughout the last two semesters. Zoffer said that he has spent close to every weekend of the year at a tournament.
“It’s just incredibly impressive to us that they were able to win this tournament, especially because they’ve only partnered with each other a limited number of times,” said Julia B. Clark ’14, president of the HSPDS.
Going forward, Sprung-Keyser said he and Zoffer will continue to work together and prepare for the world championship tournament in the winter, which is run in the British parliamentary debate format, rather than the American two-on-two style.
“The goal is to keep debating and to keep getting better,” Sprung-Keyser said.

Harvard astronomers have discovered two exoplanets in the recently found Kepler-62 planetary system that are covered in endless oceans of water, making them viable candidates for sustaining life.
These water worlds, Kepler-62e and -62f, are 1,200 light years away and are among five planets that orbit the star Kepler-62. Although astronomers do not have telescopes capable of observing these planets directly, they envision Kepler-62e and -62f as worlds entirely submersed in water.
“These two planets are small and orbit around a very distant star,” said Harvard astronomer Dimitar D. Sasselov, who authored the study with Lisa Kaltenegger. “What happens when you have a water planet like that?”
Both astronomers conduct their research with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Their work was published in the Astrophysics Journal last week.
Kepler-62e and -62f are the first water worlds discovered in the “Goldilocks Zone,” a habitable zone of the universe where the temperature is just right to create a sustainable environment for life. The temperature is “not too hot [and] not too cold” because of its distance from the sun, said Sasselov.
The astronomers modeled the terrain of these planets based on observations on their size, their distance from their sun, and their age. The Kepler-62 planetary system is about 7 billion years old.
Based on their model they found that  Kepler-62e and -62f are made up of iron core, rock, compressed solid H2O, and a relatively thin surface layer of liquid H2O—a similar composition to that of earth.
“They have not just a little bit of water, but kilometer deep oceans,” said Kaltenegger, who is also affiliated with the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy. These conditions, she said, make them life-friendly, meaning they are potentially capable of sustaining microbes and other organisms.
Both scientists said the discovery of these planets has revitalized the search for habitable water worlds closer to home.
“The next step is finding such planets around stars that are close by,” Kaltenegger said.
If they discover such worlds, scientists say they can use the next generation of telescopes to observe the spectral readings of atmospheric gases and determine whether life exists.
“Life will produce its own gases, oxygen as an example,” Sasselov said. “We want to differentiate the gases due to biology from the gases due to the planet.”
While life could habitat the recently discovered Kepler-62e and -62f, the astronomers said that because they are submerged in water and lack the heavy metals that are within the earth’s crust, it is unlikely the planets could host technology-based life.
Even so, they said it is impossible to know with certainty the habitability of worlds 1,200 light years away.
“We don’t know the inventiveness of what life can do in different circumstances,” she said. “This is all pure speculation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis said that high levels of training and familiarity between different agencies were crucial to law enforcement’s quick apprehension of the Boston Marathon bombings suspects at a Wednesday panel at Harvard’s Institute of Politics.
“We all knew each other,” he said, speaking of the members of various law enforcement agencies, many of whom had trained together in disaster-type scenarios before the marathon.
“We were people who had worked together and trained together and seen each other on a regular basis.”
He added that various types of disaster-scenario training had “forced us to think about this, to think about the unthinkable.”
Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency Director Kurt Schwartz said he agreed with Davis, adding that the city was prepared for a bombing at the marathon.
“All of the agencies and resources were [already] staged,” he said.
“We spent months preparing for the marathon. We did a tabletop exercise the week before which included a bomb scenario in it.”
As moderator, Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75 led the panel beyond the mechanics of the initial response to a discussion of the role of social media in the investigation.
Almost immediately after the bombs went off, various websites—including Twitter and Reddit—served as forums for a discussion that was at times illuminating and at others irresponsibly speculative.
At least one newspaper, the New York Post, published some of that speculation, suggesting in a front-page headline that two men were close to being considered suspects in the case when, in fact, they were not.
“That’s not logical, that’s not something that we expected,” said Davis of the mainstream media’s willingness to jump to weighty conclusions based on unconfirmed speculations. “I think it’s irresponsible on the part of the people who did it. It’s clearly a downside [to social media.]”
Though Ellwood, Davis, and Schwartz steered the discussion, other members of the panel offered a variety of perspectives removed from the lens of law enforcement officials.
WBZ-TV anchor David Wade recalled reporting from Watertown, where the Tsarnaev brothers were engaging with throngs of police. Wade said that he had fairly simple goals when he arrived at the scene.
“[I told myself] don’t get in the way, don’t give away their tactical information,” he said of the dynamic between media and law enforcement.
Explaining how he gathered reporting, Wade said he found most of his information by talking to officers who were making their way to the scene, and was able to describe what transpired for viewers using that information.
Wade said that although he always aims to gather information for his audience, in Watertown it was paramount to let law enforcement officials operate freely.
“What they’re trying to do in a situation like that is far more important than what I’m trying to do,” Wade said.
“I never got any shame in saying what I didn’t know,” he added.
Another panelist, Juliette N. Kayyem, a Kennedy School lecturer in public policy who contributed to multiple media outlets last week, also addressed the coverage of the bombings and investigation, giving particular praise to the Boston Globe, calling the paper’s work covering the marathon “proof of why you need strong local newspapers.”
The event was attended by about 120 people and featured a lengthy question-and-answer period at the end.
One participant in that session, Kennedy School Admissions Coordinator Jamie Bergstein, took the microphone wearing her blue and yellow Boston Athletic Association marathon jacket.
“This is for Commissioner Davis,” she said, beginning to choke up. “It’s not a question. I just wanted to thank you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last spring, while her peers were sitting through Life Science lectures and replicating ages-old science experiments in lab, Valentina Lyau ’15 was learning a little differently. Ten minutes down Oxford Street, Lyau swiped into the restricted-access facilities of Northwest Laboratories to construct a virtual reality as part of a research seminar called Life Sciences 100r.
LS100r is an undergraduate class through which students gain course credit for participating in hands-on research for a semester.
For her research, Lyau aided a graduate student constructing a virtual reality environment for zebra fish to measure neuron activity in response to stimuli.
“It was basically like the movie ‘The Matrix,’” says LS100r professor Alain Viel, who is also the director of the Northwest Laboratories. Viel has directed the course since it was first offered in 2004.
As a fundamental part of the course, undergraduates work with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, known as “project leaders,” who guide them in their experimentation.
In addition to lab work, students are required to attend weekly meetings, and give three presentations over the course of the semester updating the class on their progress. At the end of the course, the students deliver a public presentation of their semester’s results.
When LS100r was conceived—then as Molecular and Cellular Biology 100r—it was the first research-based course offered for credit at the College. In the time since then, the Life Sciences has created specialized research-based classes, allowing many students to pursue research for credit in labs around the University. But LS100r remains the sole class readily available to undergraduates of all concentrations and all levels of experience.
MAKING TERM-TIME RESEARCH POSSIBLE
Robert A. Lue, head of Life Sciences Education, was part of the team that got MCB100r off the ground 10 years ago. At the time, he was serving as the executive director of undergraduate education in the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, and the course was the first at the College to offer class credit for Life Sciences research.
“I knew of no other school that was dedicated to creating a class like that,” Lue says of LS100r. The for-credit class replicated a professional research environment, in which students engaged in projects that appealed to them and worked on a self-determined schedule.
Undergraduate research had been ingrained in the University for years prior to 2004, but LS100r represented the first class to award students course credit for independent research. Following LS100r’s creation and quickly escalating popularity, other concentrations have integrated similar research seminars into their course catalogue, like Chemistry 99 and Psychology 910r.
For many students, offering course credit makes research during the semester a more viable commitment.
One student planning to take advantage of these research opportunities is Doug G. Evans ’15, who intends to enroll in Chemistry 99 next fall in order to invest time in his research without sacrificing from his other schoolwork. This semester, he says, his course load makes it difficult to spend enough time in lab.
“The fact that I will get credit for working in my own lab will definitely be a plus,” Evans says.
Kyle G. Krueger ’14, an applied math concentrator pursuing a psychology secondary, says she enjoys the chance to integrate research into her course load without detracting from her concentration. She is taking Psychology 910r in the process of fulfilling her secondary and says that Harvard’s practice of offering research courses for credit makes it easier for her to engage in the field.
“It’s definitely helpful to get credit for doing psych research,” Krueger says.
LEARNING THROUGH DISCOVERY
“When you do a hands-on experiment and hear something similar in class, then it clicks,” Viel, the director of Northwest Laboratories, says. “It’s putting a face to the concept.”
This approach to learning represents an increasing emphasis on experiential learning as a part of the undergraduate experience. Currently, all nine Life Science concentrations both require a research component and offer independent advanced research seminars.
This curricular requirement demonstrates the high value the Life Sciences Cluster has placed on undergraduate research.
“Just like writing, research is a skill we’re learning by practicing and doing,” says Nicholas K. Lee ’15, an organismic and evolutionary biology concentrator who is currently enrolled in LS100r. “It’s similar to Expos in that we’re learning a skill set, but it’s much more fun than Expos.”
Research classes differ from the type of lab work students see in required or introductory level classes, like Life Sciences 1a and 1b, where students often replicate experiments that have been conducted many times over, and that have specific expected results.
“These are not cookbook projects,” says Lue. “This is current, ongoing research.”
Steve A. Buschbach ’16 is studying mating practices in C. Elegans, a commonly researched nematode, in LS100r this spring. Enrolling in this class, Buschbach’s experience is a far cry from the time-tested drills and tasks most would expect in their freshman science course—the results produced and analyzed by Buschbach and the rest of the student team on the project could shed new light on previously unknown areas of biology.
Lee, the sophomore OEB concentrator, is one of Buschbach’s teammates.
“We’re exploring and asking questions that haven’t necessarily been asked before,” Lee says.
Buschbach agrees, saying, “The idea that we’re finding something that is new to science is awesome.”
Both the students and Viel, their professor, agree that this experience in a lab is essential to a proper understanding of science.
“You don’t really get a sense of how the story unfolds unless you’re in the lab,” Viel says. “Doing research is learning how to combine a certain number of facts into a narrative.”
TRYING OUT RESEARCH
From the beginning, Viel intended for LS100r to be as widely accessible to the Harvard student body as possible.
LS100r alone among research-based classes does not demand any prerequisite courses or research experience. Even non-science concentrators can enroll for a semester.
“It is important to give some students that will ultimately not be scientists the opportunity to experience research,” Viel says. “We’re open to every student regardless of field of concentration or year.”
In the past, the class has had social sciences concentrators as well as a law student who wanted to better understand the experience of lab work before going into the field of patent law. Even within the life sciences, however, many students have never worked in a lab or been exposed to research, so LS100r provides an avenue to explore research without joining a lab officially.
“It’s a great way for students to decide whether or not research is for them,” Viel says.
Buschbach had never done research before coming to Harvard this fall, so he jumped at the opportunity “to know what it was like to do research here,” he says.
And while students in most introductory classes will be exposed to lab reports and learn scientific principles through textbooks and basic lab work, Lue says that any sort of science education is incomplete without a research component.
“No matter what you end up doing, research is what science is all about,” Lue says.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite the cancellation of Harvard’s admitted student weekend in the wake of a week of chaos following the Boston marathon bombings, admissions counselors and prospective students agree that the yield for the Class of 2017 will likely be consistent with that of years past.
Visitas, Harvard’s visiting weekend program, attracts more than 1,000 prospective students to campus annually for a weekend of events meant to acclimate them to life at Harvard. The College canceled last weekend’s programming in the midst of a lockdown of the greater Boston area as police sought a suspected terrorist, leaving some admitted students unable to make it to campus and learn about the social, academic, and extracurricular offerings at Harvard.
Friday night, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 told The Crimson that “it’s absolutely impossible to know” how the cancellation of Visitas might impact the yield for the Class of 2017.
“This is an unprecedented event,” Fitzsimmons said, “and it’s very difficult to know how it might go.”
But less than a week after last Friday’s events, Michael Goran, director and educational consultant at California college counseling firm IvySelect, said he did not think the atypical visiting weekend experience for the Class of 2017 would “make any sort of appreciable difference” on Harvard’s yield.
“[It’s] not to say that security issues aren’t a piece of what families consider when they’re looking at where to send their kids or where the student wants to go, but...these are isolated incidents that I don’t think it will have any dramatic repercussions on whether students decide to attend the school,” said Goran.
Last year, 81 percent of students admitted chose to attend Harvard. In 2011, nearly 77 percent of students chose to attend.
Anna Ivey, founder of the college admissions consulting firm Ivey Consulting, said she also thought there would likely be little impact on Harvard’s yield.
“[Prospective students] still will want to go [to Harvard] as much as they did before,” she said, adding that she believes “the people who applied to Harvard were quite motivated to attend” from the start.
Students interviewed by The Crimson agreed that last weeks event did little to influence their opinion of Harvard.
Lejla Skokic, a high school student accepted to the class of 2017, said that if anything, she was impressed by the University’s handling of the uncertainty created by last week’s lockdown.
“After what happened with the bombings, and the manhunt, I was worried people would get the wrong impression of Boston,” Skokic said. “But I think they did a really good job handling it. It goes to show that the [administrators] really do care about the people who live here.”
For Rosa Bonilla, another prospective member of the class of 2017, the cancellation of Visitas was “disappointing” but did not impact her decision.
“Not having Visitas didn’t impact my decision, but it’s definitely disappointing. I really don’t think it changes anything in the long run,” Bonilla said. “It’s just more unfortunate that I didn’t get to spend any time [at Harvard] while school was in session.”
Both Bonilla and Skokic said they plan to attend Harvard in the fall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With flickering candles in hand, about 50 Harvard community members gathered in front of Memorial Church Wednesday evening to share or listen to stories of healing after sexual assault.
For nearly an hour, attendees stood in a circle talking and reflecting as twilight faded into darkness. Several community members spoke up to describe experiences with sexual violence that affected them or someone they knew. For minutes at a time between moments of sharing, the group fell into silence.
After attendees had shared their stories, the group embarked on a “healing walk” across campus that stopped at the John Harvard statue, Boylston Hall, and Lowell House for readings of inspirational poetry and prose.
The vigil was the finale of a series of events marking “Take Back the Night,” a month-long initiative dedicated to raising awareness about sexual and domestic violence on campus and in the wider community. The events at Harvard were sponsored by the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
Attendee Herman K. Bhupal ’16, a student liaison for OSAPR, said she was moved by Wednesday’s vigil.
“It was one thing to go from reading someone’s blog about their experience with sexual assault to standing feet away from someone,” Bhupal said. “The physicality of it was really powerful.”
Another attendee, Amanda I. Morejon ’13, said the vigil had “great symbolism.”
“After having done this whole month, we collectively and powerfully break silence,” said Morejon, who is a co-director of the sexual assault peer counseling group Response. “People not only go for themselves but also for others, as supporters and allies. That’s the thing about sexual violence, sexual assault, and rape—it almost never just affects that person. It affects them the hardest, but it hits the community.”
Reflecting broadly on the month’s events, Sarah A. Rankin, director of OSAPR, said she was pleased with the Take Back the Night programming, which ranged from film screenings to a discussion about consent and negotiation with Harvard College Munch, the kinky sex discussion group.
“We really tried to do a wide range of topics,” Rankin said. “I thought the lineup of events was incredible.”

On Wednesday night, around 100 students spent part of the evening folding paper cranes in Winthrop Common Room. The cranes, totalling 285 so far, were made to remember last week’s bombing and subsequent manhunt that claimed four lives and injured hundreds.
“The idea is to fold a thousand paper cranes in the spirit of peace,” said organizer Ola Topczewska ’15, who is also a Crimson arts editor. She emphasized the link between last week’s tragedies and the need for unity. Despite the pain caused by tragedies of the past week, she said that the Boston area, including Harvard, “came together in a strong community.”
Creating a thousand cranes for peace has become a recurring response to tragedy. The tradition has roots in a Japanese legend that anyone who folds 1,000 paper cranes will receive one wish from a crane.
Topczewska said she and her co-organizers hope to display the cranes publicly once completed, perhaps by hanging them at the Arts First festival this upcoming weekend.
Students wandered in and out of Wednesday’s event, taking a seat on a couch or armchair and picking up sheets of brightly patterned paper to fold. Those who struggled with the complicated folds turned to neighbors for help or read instructions from sheets scattered on tables.
Above the chatter, a variety of students performed with talents ranging from classical violin to piano to singing and songwriting. A number of spoken word artists from student group Speak Out Loud also performed.
Topczewska described the night’s entertainment as “a whole spectrum of performers, from people who are in [a joint degree program] with the New England Conservatory to people who play in their spare time.”
With attendees who often came and went, the group did not actually make 1,000 cranes, but organizers said they hope to continue working their way towards their goal, perhaps in the newly-completed plaza outside the Science Center during Harvard’s upcoming Arts First festival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Speaking before a Sanders Theatre crowd on Thursday, Academy Award-winning actor and filmmaker Matt Damon, a Cambridge native formerly of the Class of 1992, said he was glad to be home in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings.
“Particularly right now, it’s good to be back in Boston,” Damon said.
Damon came to Harvard Thursday to accept the 2013 Harvard Arts Medal at a ceremony marking the start of the weekend's Arts First festival.
In a conversation with fellow actor and Arts First co-founder John A. Lithgow ’67, Damon regaled the crowd with stories of his start in acting and screenwriting, partially attributing his success to his local upbringing.
“I’m really proud to come from here,” Damon said. “Of all the accolades and movies and all that stuff, whenever someone says my name, they say the name of this university too, and that means a lot to me. I’ve always tried to live my life in a way that honored that and a way that deserved that.”
Damon grew up in Central Square and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School—the same high school that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, one of the alleged marathon bombers, also attended years later. Damon went on to attend Harvard, and before dropping out to pursue his acting career, wrote the first draft of the screenplay for the film “Good Will Hunting” in a Harvard playwriting class.
Lithgow, who introduced Damon at the start of the ceremony, also acclaimed Damon’s local ties.
“He is a child of Boston,” Lithgow said. “The fact that he’s here at this particular moment in Boston’s history makes his visit this year particularly poignant.”
University President Drew G. Faust presented Damon with the medal, remarking on Harvard’s enduring relationship with its famous former student.
“As we feel inspired by the people in Boston and by the power of the arts to heal and renew us, we are especially grateful for the wonder of our ongoing dialogue with Matt Damon on and off the screen,” Faust said.
A committee of faculty, alumni, and administrators nominated Damon for the award on account of his acclaimed acting career and his efforts to use his success in the arts to serve others. Damon is a strong advocate for improving water quality worldwide, reforming education, and finding a cure for AIDS.
Attendees said they were impressed by Damon.
“He’s a really humble guy,” Yacoub H. Kureh ’13 said. “The way he talks about philanthropy, you can tell it’s not something he just does on the side, like some other celebrities.”
Suvai Gunasekaran ’13 agreed, saying, “you could really tell how much he cared about the Boston community.”
As the crowd exited Sanders after the ceremony, student volunteers collected donations for people affected by last week’s violence in Boston.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team may have already clinched a share of the Ivy League title, but it still has bigger goals to accomplish.
The No. 21 Crimson (17-4, 5-0 Ivy) will try to complete its first undefeated Ivy season since 2008 and secure its 30th conference championship when it takes on Brown (13-9, 2-3 Ivy) at home on Thursday and then wraps up its season at Dartmouth (9-13, 1-5 Ivy) on Saturday.
The Bears and the Big Green, who sit in sixth and seventh place in the Ancient Eight, respectively, have combined for just three conference victories all season. They played each other on Sunday in Providence, and Brown prevailed, 4-3.
Despite the struggles of its upcoming opponents, Harvard does not intend to overlook them and coast across the finish line.
“We don’t want to share the title,” head coach Dave Fish said. “So we can’t sit there and say that we’re fat cats now. We have to have the attitude that if we’ve done well, don’t diminish it by putting in a halfhearted effort.”
The Crimson was scheduled to take on Brown at home on April 19, but the match was rescheduled due to the citywide manhunt for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Harvard will instead face the Bears on Thursday evening.
A victory in either of its two matches this week will give the Crimson its second consecutive uncontested conference crown.
Harvard has historically dominated the Bears, going 75-7 all-time. The Crimson has also won eight of its past nine matches against Brown, including two victories last year.
Thursday’s match will also mark the final home tilt for co-captain Andy Nguyen, the lone senior on the team.
Nguyen has enjoyed a successful senior season, going 12-2 at the fourth singles spot and teaming with freshman Nicky Hu to post a 9-4 mark at No. 2 doubles.
“Andy’s had a great career and has contributed so much to the team,” Hu said. “It’s great to see someone who’s worked so hard academically and athletically succeed and play at such a high level in his last year.”
While the Bears have a winning record this season, they have struggled in Ancient Eight play. Brown took its Ivy opener against Penn, but lost three straight to Princeton, Columbia, and Cornell before beating Dartmouth this past weekend.
The Bears boast a solid bottom half of the lineup. Playing at third and fourth singles, junior Sam Fife has notched three wins in four Ivy matches.
Sophomore Daniel Hirschberg had been a model of consistency for Brown, winning each of his four singles matches in conference play before dropping a three-setter against the Big Green.
“Brown’s No. 4 beat our No. 1 last year, and their No. 5 beat our current No. 1 [Denis Nguyen] a year ago too,” Fish said. “If that doesn’t sober you up quickly, I don’t know what does. These guys are dangerous, and if you don’t prepare, that’s enough to change the match.”
Dartmouth has slipped after finishing third in the Ancient Eight in the past two seasons, and has only a 4-2 win over the Lions in early April to show for its conference season. It has lost its last four matches.
The Big Green’s Xander Centenari and Brandon DeBot have had a successful season in doubles, going 9-5 overall in dual play. But they will have to take on Harvard’s dominant first doubles team of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and Denis Nguyen, who are ranked 52nd in the nation and are 11-1 on the season.
Consistency has been an issue for Dartmouth, but the lack of a regular lineup has paid off in some respects. 10 different combinations at No. 3 doubles have produced an overall 9-5 record, and six different players have combined to go 13-1 in sixth singles this season.
But the team has struggled at the top. Centenari is just 3-8 in No. 1 singles, and two teams have combined for a 5-8 record in first doubles.
Brown and Dartmouth represent the final two obstacles for the Crimson in completing an unblemished conference season and earning an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, which starts May 10.
“We know we have a couple matches to go,” Hu said. “Our mindset is to focus not just on the Ivy League, but also on NCAAs and improving our individual games in preparation. So we’re going to go at these last few matches just as hard.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Good things have come in twos recently for the Harvard men’s tennis team. On Sunday, the team lost just two matches en route to a 5-2 victory over rival Yale. That win earned the Crimson at least a share of its second consecutive Ivy League title. And a big reason that No. 22 Harvard (17-4, 5-0 Ivy) is in a position to repeat as outright conference champions is the play of its dynamic duos.
The Crimson’s consistently strong doubles play has been essential to its 12-match winning streak. It is no accident that Harvard’s 12 straight victories perfectly coincide with its taking the crucial doubles point in 12 consecutive matches. Each of the team’s three regular doubles teams boasts a winning record in dual play, and the top tandem of junior co-captain Casey MacMaster and sophomore Denis Nguyen is ranked 52nd nationally.
“All you have to do to realize the importance of doubles is imagine what the result of all of those matches would be if we hadn’t won the doubles point,” head coach Dave Fish said. “It probably makes the difference between being ranked where we are now and being ranked 50th to 60th. If two equal teams are good enough to split the singles, then the doubles is the tiebreaker.”
In the team’s 12-match winning streak, five have been decided by a 4-3 margin, including two conference wins. Without strong doubles play, Harvard may not be two wins away from completing a perfect Ancient Eight slate and fighting for a higher seed in the NCAA tournament.
The team believes that winning the doubles point also gives it a strong mental edge, according to freshman Nicky Hu, who teams with senior co-captain Andy Nguyen on the No. 2 court.
“Winning the doubles point gives us the biggest mental boost heading into the singles matches,” he said. “If we win it, we only have to win half of the singles matches as opposed to four. Plus, everyone is less pressured to win their matches and so they can go out and just focus on playing their game.”
A DIFFERENT GAME
Because of the strategic benefits gained from successful doubles play, the team has placed an emphasis on improving that facet of its game. Hu credits the work of assistant coach Eric Butorac, who has been ranked as highly as 17th in the world in doubles, with the progress the team has made.
“He’s devised an effective doubles warm-up for us that’s different from our singles one,” Hu explained. “It involves anything we would see in a doubles match—crosscourt shots, close volleys, and from all different spots.”
Doubles requires a different set of physical skills than does singles, and the best singles players do not always make the best doubles players. MacMaster does not always start in singles, but has consistently been at the top in doubles.
“Doubles takes a completely different player,” MacMaster explained. “Singles is more of a baseline game with rallying, and you have to win points with groundstrokes. With doubles, it’s your serve, your return, and quick hands at the net. As a tall player, I don’t hit groundstrokes often in singles. I usually serve and volley, and that’s a skill that translates to doubles really well.”
Not only does doubles require a different set of physical skills, but it also takes a different mental approach.
“Doubles is just a different mindset,” Andy Nguyen said. “Singles is a bit slower paced, whereas doubles is really quick and intense. In singles, you have to manage your energy more so than in doubles.”
PERFECT PAIRINGS
Given the importance of doubles, finding pairings that work is imperative. The goal is to match players who have complementary physical skills, but it is often an inexact science.
“Sometimes I have ideas about pairings that I think will work, but it doesn’t work out or my players will disagree,” Fish said. “I don’t think any of us have all the answers.”
Hu agrees that it is largely a process of trial and error, and noted how he and Andy Nguyen came to play together.
“We didn’t start out as playing partners,” he recounted. “But then at [the ITA Northeast Regionals in October] they put us together and we had a big win over Dartmouth’s No. 1 team. From then on, it was clear we had some chemistry and the coaches decided to put us together for the year.”
Fish detailed some of the characteristics that can make pairings effective.
“It’s a lot like a volleyball team,” Fish explained. “There’s setters and then hitters. So Denis hits the ball very sharply, but then Casey has an enormous serve. Together, Denis plays bigger when backed up by Casey and Casey plays bigger because of Denis’ ability to place the ball. It’s a lovely combination.”
MacMaster echoed Fish’s sentiments about why he and Denis Nguyen are so successful.
“Denis has the angles and the power, and it helps me at the net to have consistent power behind me,” he said. “He really sets the point up for me to finish it off.”
But this setter-finisher dynamic is not the only way to be a strong tandem. Hu said he and Andy Nguyen’s success is attributable more to their consistency.
“What makes a good doubles team is a team who forces the opponent’s hand,” he argued. “If you put a lot of returns and first serves in, you’ll grind the other team down. It’s the biggest thing Andy and I are good at. Andy is great at the net and on returns. On my serve, it’s easy to win games because he’s very comfortable at net.”
PARTNER TRUST
But the fact that two players are physically complementary does not automatically equal success; a degree of mental compatibility and trust is crucial to success.
“Nicky and I have plays where I’ll tell him where he should serve and what I’m going to do,” Andy Nguyen explained. “He knows what I’ll do, and he reacts accordingly. It’s very instinctive, and there’s a flow and level of trust there. I know I can depend on him, and we can pump each other up when the other isn’t playing well.”
Confidence and trust, says Hu, are crucial to the success of doubles pairings, and that close relationship extends off the court.
“Getting along well makes a big difference,” Hu said. “Andy and I get along really well. Off the court, we hang out together sometimes. We relate because of our Asian heritage, and I help him with his Chinese homework sometimes. All of that plays into our chemistry.”
Others agree that such off-court rapport contributes to good chemistry come game time..
“All of the guys get along really well. If you don’t get along off the court, it’s really tough to have faith in your partner when you’re down a break point,” MacMaster noted. “You have to call where to serve and return, and you have to have the faith and trust that he will hit the right ball.”
According to Fish, the teamwork and relationships that doubles builds for the team has been key to the Crimson’s overall success.
“Doubles is a marvelous instrument for making your team better,” Fish said. “It teaches the guys the importance of how to support a teammate in a direct way, and brings out much more of their humanity. Our team dynamic is a very delicate spider web. If one guy is getting a foothold, he pulls everyone in that direction and makes our whole team more courageous and ultimately successful.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After finishing the season strong, the Harvard men’s volleyball team will challenge George Mason on Thursday night in the first round of the EIVA conference tournament, hosted by Penn State.
The Crimson (17-8, 10-4 EIVA) enters the tournament as the third seed, while the Patriots (15-11, 11-3) are ranked second in the conference.
“We feel pretty good right now,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We’ve been playing some really good volleyball and have been great in practice. Despite some rough patches here and there, we’ve been pretty consistent, so I think we have a great shot.”
The two teams met twice during the regular season, once at each venue, and both matches resulted in George Mason victories. The Patriots are the only team to beat the Crimson twice this season.
“George Mason is a really tough team,” junior co-captain Nick Madden said. “They are probably one of the tougher opponents remaining in the tournament.”
In the first encounter, the Patriots swept Harvard on their own court, dominating throughout the match. In that contest, George Mason’s hitters posted a .323 hitting percentage, well above the Crimson’s .146 mark. In addition, the Patriots tallied 8.5 blocks to Harvard’s 3. The Crimson did not score more than 20 points in any of the three games.
In the second match, Harvard came out with urgency, and the contest initially looked like it would have a different result from the first of the series.
In the first set, the Crimson secured 18 hits on its way to a 25-22 victory. But after George Mason took a close second game, Harvard fell apart, dropping both of the next two sets, 25-16 and 25-22, respectively, and losing the match. The Crimson’s hitters notched a kill percentage of .364 in the first set, .292 in the second, .138 in the third, and .088 in the fourth, emblematic of the team’s rapid decline through the match.
“There is a lot of stuff that we need to do better,” Baise said. “We need to receive their serves well, we need to play good defense in the back row, and if we can do that and stop them from getting easy points, then I think we can match up really well with them.”
Harvard had trouble matching the Patriots’ service and hitting production in the two matches. Over the course of the series, the Crimson has had 4 aces and 19 errors, while George Mason has had 10 aces and 23 errors. This, combined with the Patriots’ 97 kills and 31 errors (to Harvard’s 80 and 41), has contibuted to the one-sided outcome.
“George Mason has a really deep lineup,” Madden said. “They serve well and they hit hard, but I think we have the weapons to beat them, and we’re going to [this time].”
The Crimson finished the season 5-1 after spring break, losing only to George Mason. Harvard is coming off of back-to-back games of hitting over .400 for the first time this season. The team has been led by Madden, who has 19 kills, and sophomore outside hitter DJ White, who has 16 kills, over that stretch.
“We’ve been playing really well recently,” Madden said. “We’ve had our ups and downs in games, but overall we’ve done a great job. Practices have really been great this week and I think we are pretty well prepared.”
This is the second year in a row in which Harvard has made the EIVA tournament. Last year, the Crimson was ranked second in the conference, but fell to the third-seeded Patriots in three games. Harvard is 1-4 against George Mason over the last two years.
“I hope our experience last year will help,” Baise said. “The guys are going down [to Penn State] a lot more relaxed and a lot more confident. Now that we’ve been there—we know the arena, we know the atmosphere—it should make a big difference for us. We are much more comfortable, far more than we were last year, as we look to compete for a league title.”
If the Crimson can win on Thursday, then it will challenge the winner of Penn State and Princeton in the conference championship on Saturday for an automatic bid to the NCAA championships. Harvard is 1-1 against both teams this season.
“I would love another opportunity to play Penn State in the finals,” Madden said. “I think they’re going to beat Princeton pretty handily, but are a very beatable team, even at home. We beat them 3-0 already and I would feel very confident about that matchup as well as this one [against George Mason].”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time that the Harvard football team stepped out competitively onto the gridiron, senior running back Treavor Scales raced down the sidelines on a 63-yard scamper that put away The Game for the Crimson, while quarterback Colton Chapple connected on two touchdown passes and ran in for another score to secure the victory.
On Saturday night, when Harvard showcases its work since the end of last season in its annual spring game, that team will look markedly different. Missing from the field will be Chapple and Scales, both graduating seniors and key leaders on the field.
“Anytime you lose kids, Ivy League Player of the Year caliber guys like Colton Chapple, and you lose one of the great running backs in Harvard history in Treavor Scales, you lose a lot,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Not just in terms of productivity and ability, but leadership. Both of those guys were tremendous leaders by example and were inspiration-type players, so it’ll be a challenge.”
But the loss of Chapple and Scales won’t be the only losses felt—the Crimson will also be playing next year without Kyle Juszczyk, a halfback projected to be drafted into the NFL this weekend. Juszczyk, who led Harvard’s receiving corp last year with eight touchdowns and over 700 yards receiving, represented one half of the Crimson’s two-tight-end offense that has led to one of the most productive offenses in the Ivy League for the last decade.
Stepping up in Juszczyk’s role will likely be Tyler Hamblin, a rising junior who is similar to Juszczyk not only in the position he plays on the field, but also in his high school football background.
“Tyler is a converted quarterback out of high school—the biggest similarities [between him and Juszczyk] were that both were high school quarterbacks,” Murphy said. “Tyler probably doesn’t have the physical ability that Kyle had yet, but he’s extremely coachable and 6’4”, 240 [pounds], and he can do all of the things that Kyle did, which is why we want to make sure we don’t ask him right away to do things at [Juszczyk’s] level, it’s not realistic. Tyler Hamblin’s had a heck of a spring—it’s not a surprise, but it’s been a relief for all of us.”
The battle for quarterback is less clear-cut, as rising senior Michael Pruneau looks to show off his talent after being sidelined during the 2012 season with an ACL injury. His toughest competitor will likely be rising junior Conner Hempel, the only quarterback besides Chapple to throw a pass last season.
“Conner Hempel’s been competing against Pruneau, and I don’t even know which one’s going to be our starting quarterback,” said rising junior defensive end Zach Hodges. “The two of them have been working unbelievably hard. I head into the locker room at 4 a.m. before anyone gets in to watch some film, and the first people I see come in are Conner Hempel and Pruneau, and my roommate Norman Hayes, and they all come in together so it’s really been my teammates that I’ve seen step up.”
Rising sophomores Paul Stanton and Zach Boden are the probable candidates to fill the void left by Scales, who recorded his first 1000-yard rushing season last season. Stanton bolstered the running game last season, supplementing Scales by rushing for 171 yards in his rookie season while Boden returns to the team after not being listed on the roster last season.
“With guys like Paul Stanton and Zach Boden, we really feel like we’re going to have outstanding ability and leadership at [running back],” Murphy said. “It remains to be seen if they can compete at that extremely high level that those guys competed in, but we’re confident that those guys can do the job.”
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson must deal with the loss of John Lyon, a fifth-year defensive end who recorded 7.5 sacks over the season and played a crucial leadership role on the field, as well as the graduation of players like captain Bobby Schneider. But players like Hodges, who rivaled Lyon in the pass rush with nine sacks, as well as players with less experience, are ready to step in to plug gaps left by veterans.
“I’ve personally watched how our entire D-line has steadily been improving,” Hodges said. “We have defensive backs [like rising sophomore] Asante Gibson stepping up, every freshmen in every position has been taking serious leaps in this program, all the way from winter workouts. We get up at 5 o’clock every morning to lift weights every day through spring ball, and they’re starting to take a lead in their plays, being able to call plays, run plays, make plays. All of these guys, they’re going from last year when they were on the scout team, to next year, they’re going to be taking significant reps, making significant plays, and taking on serious roles for the team.”
Although the spring game will not answer all of the questions remaining for the team, Hodges notes the importance of the game as another marker on the way to the next Ancient Eight title run.
“It’s now huge on the younger guys on the team, the freshmen on the team, [as well as] the rising upperclassmen—this is like their shifting moment when they have to step up and become leaders,” Hodges said. “Everyone’s kind of taking in their roles on the team for the new season, so just want to cement all the hard work we’ve been putting in in the offseason and try to bring it all into fruition before the summer as a team and to define ourselves as a unit.”
