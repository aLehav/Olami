After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many read to help process reality. A book’s ability to capture life experiences — though perhaps different from a reader’s own — provides a sense of comfort, a step closer to solidarity and away from isolation. Of course, behind every sharp observation or insightful analysis lies an author that has translated their own thoughts onto the page. Many writers, for one reason or another, are less adept in their ability to make these analyses and write about them effectively.
Luckily, Elif Batuman ’99 is not one of those people.
Some may recognize her name from her novel, “The Idiot” — the 2018 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in Fiction and callback to Dostoevsky’s novel of the same name. Protagonist Selin’s characteristic dry humor and frank storytelling that accompany her navigation of freshman year of college at Harvard have made the novel a fan and critic favorite since its release.
Though “The Idiot” was her debut novel, Batuman’s body of work began to take shape years earlier. In 2010, she published “The Possessed: Adventures with Russian Books and the People Who Read Them,” a memoir detailing her time in graduate school at Stanford University studying Russian literature. Though not as popular as “The Idiot” would come to be, “The Possessed” was a first look into the distinctive style of its author: a keen and witty exploration of literary theory, the absurd, academia, and, of course, Russian literature.
The recurring themes visible in Batuman’s work — a university setting, Russian literature, Turkish identity — come from a place familiar to the author. It is not difficult to connect “The Idiot” and sequel “Either/Or”’s protagonist Selin to Batuman herself, the only child of Turkish immigrants in New Jersey and an alumna of both Harvard College and Stanford University. And though the novel is categorized as semi-autobiographical, it was often difficult to navigate the line between fiction and nonfiction in her writing.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Batuman recalled that though she had always wanted to write a novel, her early creative experiences were “kind of contingent on what the publishing landscape was and what the writing landscape was.” Autobiographical fiction in the early 2000s was not what it is today, so Batuman found herself submitting pieces that she considered fiction or part of a novel in progress to publishers, only to be told that her piece had, in fact, all the components of an essay.
Though not her original genre of choice, Batuman soon found herself experiencing a sense of liberation in nonfiction.
“There was something about writing nonfiction that was extremely freeing and exciting because it took all of this pressure off of me to try to invent things and add things,” Batuman said. “I had been thinking of invention as something that would be liberating — like I’m not constrained by the weird way things happened to have happened, I can make it up however — but once I was doing nonfiction I saw that if you follow the things that happen, they happen in ways that you couldn’t even imagine, actually.”
Batuman spent a few years building an impressive nonfiction resume, with writing published in The New Yorker, Harper’s Magazine, and N+1 (all of which would eventually become components of “The Possessed”). She has also been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 2010.
Lessons of artistic freedom found in nonfiction experiences then translated to her approaches towards fiction. In fact, “The Idiot” was an unfinished draft that Batuman started writing in graduate school about an undergraduate crush, which she later revisited in her 30s as a result of time-earned perspective.
Thus came to life Selin, and the accounts of Selin’s experiences — based partly in Batuman’s — that would constitute “The Idiot” as well as “Either/Or,” the 2022 sequel documenting Selin’s sophomore year.
Batuman clearly excels as a writer, but equally impressive — if not more so — are her abilities as a thinker. The plentiful insights in her published writings are reflective of her inquisitive nature, but a short interaction with the author reveals that she is also a lifelong learner — still as curious about humanity and society as ever.
Intertwined within “Either/Or,” for instance, are Batuman’s contemplations on the role of politics in her life. Notably, “The Idiot” received some responses from readers commenting on the fact that Selin appears to lack a political consciousness.
This, in fact, mirrors Batuman’s own experiences. Growing up, she said, “I thought of myself as a literature person and not a politics person and I thought of these things as being different. And over a few years that distinction started to strike me as very sinister and that’s actually a way that young women are depoliticized.”
Part of writing Selin’s story for Batuman is reconstructing the circumstances of her own memories. She finds herself reflecting on her experiences with both a critical eye informed by personal growth and a mindset of empathy and understanding.
And perhaps most important of all, Batuman’s identity as an author is fundamentally derived from her identity as a reader whose reverence for the power of the novel is palpable — someone whose experiences with reading, such as hers with Russian literature, have been transformative.
“[Life’s] contradictions can be very scary. They can make you panic and feel powerless and potentially annihilated and like nothing is real,” Batuman said. “And the idea that there is a way of yourself juxtaposing all of those voices and controlling them and bringing them together and creating something that’s harmonious and ultimately delightful for another person — that was hugely, hugely inspirational. And more than inspirational — I think it helped me survive.”
These subtleties and nuances of thought are precisely what make Batuman’s work such stellar reads, and serve as a reminder of the distinct and invaluable perspectives that come from positions of non-hegemony, such as that of a queer Turkish-American woman. Individually, too, Batuman’s abilities should not be understated. Aside from being an incredibly down-to-earth and inviting personality, her thoughtfulness, curiosity, and keen analytical mind make it clear that this is only the beginning, and there are still many more exciting things to come from Elif Batuman.

Let me begin with an uncontroversial claim: There is virtue in humility and in seeking to understand other people’s motives.
No one disputes this on its face. Surely, most can agree that rejecting this principle would toxify our civic life and cripple our effort to coexist harmoniously.
But every day, in school, politics, and social life, we eschew moderation and attempts to understand in favor of indignation and disgust — even at institutions dedicated to seeking truth.
Take originalism, the preferred interpretive framework of most of the Supreme Court’s conservative justices and the basis for its recent decision in Dobbs v. Jackson overturning the constitutional right to abortion. When Roe v. Wade fell, The Crimson Editorial Board issued a scathing condemnation of the majority’s conclusion. That piece, as with much other protest, was strongest when it was moral, highlighting the importance of the right to the health and autonomy of women.
But in equal measure, the piece was weakest when it was legal. This Board did not mince words about the “farcical legal theatre” behind the opinion, reflecting its apparent belief that there is no legal basis for the decision. Accordingly, it made only casual use of technical terms like “fundamental right” at the heart of long-running doctrinal debates to draw sweeping legal conclusions that its reasoning could not support. This needlessly obscured the powerful moral argument at the heart of the piece: that women’s bodies should not be conscripted to carry unwanted children to term.
It is, of course, entirely reasonable to have serious grievances with the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson, and that doesn’t require any knowledge of the law. But how many Harvard students have engaged with the judicial philosophy that underpins it? Instead of truly interrogating why originalists think the way they do, we have reduced a complex legal ideology, worthy of our scrutiny and critique, to “gaseous misogyny.”
As the vitriol of the culture wars has grown more venomous, our natural response has been mistrust – an utter lack of faith that those with whom we disagree are acting in good faith. While not always unwarranted, it has contaminated every corner of American life.
This especially includes how we talk to one another. Quality discourse requires believing that the other has something of value to say. It is difficult to possess this kind of intellectual humility when one’s opponents appear so ill-intentioned and, well, wrong. It is easy, by contrast, to feel humble when our convictions seem incontestable. To many, pro-choice attitudes can only result from a callous indifference to life, or pro-life views from a misogynistic sort of religious dogmatism.
Do not take me to mean that people should not feel galvanized, even disgusted, about political affairs. Political beliefs are expressions of deeply personal, important values and experiences that are worth fighting for. Few issues exemplify this more strongly than the right to abortion.
My fear, rather, is that mistrust has led us to lose sight of powerful, politically neutral principles essential to living together constructively. I believe that recommitting to the following two maxims would go a long way towards healing our culture: One, embodying intellectual humility does not require one to believe that they are wrong, and two, charitably interpreting the motives of those with whom one disagrees does not require compromising one’s deeply held beliefs.
The understanding that no one person has every answer is an essential counterbalance to the excesses of passion and purpose.  Often, being more attuned to why people think what they think will not reverse one’s beliefs or even substantially alter them. But the very act of listening allows us to distinguish the vast majority of our ideological opponents from the worst of their partisans.
To be clear, being charitable to the stated motives of others does not deny the reality that many individuals do not act in good faith. I am not suggesting, for instance, that you take Senator Josh Hawley’s tweets at face value. I am also under no illusion that your ideological opponents will always extend this same courtesy to you. But why would they ever do so if nobody made an effort? To disarm other people’s instinct to distrust, we must signal that we are willing to engage, not without qualification, but with an open ear and genuine desire to understand.
Both of these principles require us to affirmatively choose trust. That won’t be easy. But I believe adopting them is the only way for us to exit this vicious cycle of ideological polarization. If we can move away from the notion that those in our lives with seriously different views are bad people, fundamentally incompatible with us in civic and social life, we can both reinvigorate our political discourse and more fully realize the benefits of our diversity.
Our nation has more than 330 million people. Collectively, we represent far too broad a range of values and experiences to prosper in a culture that lionizes “owning the libs” and punishes compromise. This means you should speak your mind — about Dobbs v. Jackson or whatever else draws your fervor. But try having trust, too. See what insights it allows you to uncover. Our fracturing political system depends on it.

One thing I’ve learned from the pandemic: My friends are incredibly talented people.
Alone in my room, I’ve spent hours scrolling through their social media accounts, which display indisputable proof of their artistic skill. One friend runs an Instagram account that features everything from amazingly detailed, lifelike paintings, to emotionally raw animated shorts. Another has gone viral again and again on TikTok for their funny skits and sketches. A third posts captivating travel vlogs and lifestyle content on YouTube.
And another thing the pandemic so far has taught me: The hobby as we know it is about to die out. And hustle culture is to blame.
For the uninitiated, hustle culture is loosely defined by the philosophy that every minute of our lives can be spent being more “productive.” We should be waking up earlier. We should be hacking our passive “dead time” to be actively improving ourselves. We should be pushing ourselves at our jobs — and hey, why just stop at one? With the internet and the rise of informal business models and selling platforms, it’s now possible — and even encouraged — to have one, two, or three side gigs.
This attitude isn’t new — it’s a lifestyle craze that’s consistently waxed and waned over the years. As the Covid-19 hellscape continued, it seemed for a while that one possible benefit of the pandemic was a quiet, but definite, pushback against hustle culture. With spiking rates of burnout and poor mental health during the pandemic, the anti-work movement popped its welcome head over the horizon, and relaxation, meditation, and hobbies took center stage.
While it’s had — and continues to have — horrific consequences for public health and global wellbeing, the pandemic appeared to present a small silver lining: the renaissance of art in our daily lives. We consumed art more than ever before, but we produced it, too. In small, personal ways, many of us blossomed as artists — whether that meant finally starting that screenplay, learning how to make sourdough, or building a backyard vegetable garden.
But as more and more people turned to art for comfort, hustle culture sank its teeth into a new target. And we’re now seeing the ugly results: art becoming content, creativity becoming production, and the slow extinction of the simple, creative hobby.
As an uncertain future collides with the gig economy and a sudden work-from-home culture that may be here to stay, the temptation to “hustle” our hobbies is more present than ever before. There are more and more help guides, both in print and online, promising to teach you how to sell your art. Baking, sewing, and craft content racks up millions of monetizable views on TikTok and YouTube. Thousands of successful art accounts on Instagram direct followers to Etsy shops and merch websites.
One thing to be clear on: I’m not saying all of this to condemn the artists in question. In fact, there is nothing at all objectively wrong with wanting to make a bit of extra income, especially in times like these.
The real problem lies in the fact that, on a more fundamental level, the “hustle” mentality isn’t rooted in monetary return. Instead, it’s a craving for a specifically curated social media presence, which is ultimately about one thing, and one thing only: external validation. All of a sudden, it’s not enough to sketch privately in your notebook, or try out a new recipe; it just doesn’t seem worthwhile unless you’re posting about it online, and getting your followers to see you in a specific way.
Of course, wanting attention on social media is not new. Bragging, certainly, is not new. But the danger of marrying artistic hobbies with hustle culture is not about narcissism at all. It’s about the fact that the locus of our quotidian creative expression has become twisted away from ourselves: the artists. Ironically, in a period of unprecedented isolation, the significance behind our artistic creation has become external, rather than internal.
You might stop me at this point and argue: Hasn’t art kind of always been about external validation? What’s the good of a film that no one will watch, or a book that no one will read? Actually, there’s a lot of good. Producing art in the form of the thoroughly unproductive hobby is the core of what makes us human. Our creative leisure activities, through which we process our emotions and express ourselves — aren’t they the essence of the human experience?
Whether in the form of sketches, short stories, or cupcakes, if we stop viewing our art as ours, the activity of creative expression starts to lose meaning. If we’re chasing followers, views, or purchases in return for our art, we’re not remembering to be imaginative, reflective, or innovative.
If we try to productize every minute of our time, there comes a point where we’re being obedient, not creative.
So as we face an ongoing pandemic, a turbulent professional landscape, and a bleak economic reality, let’s try to take a second before we snap that picture of our newest project and mine for likes. Because if we don’t, the humble hobby as we know it will draw its last breath.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla was supposed to be on his honeymoon.
Early August tasted like queer triumph, a chance for Ventocilla, a transgender man and prominent activist, to celebrate his nuptials on the beaches of Bali, Indonesia. But at the airport, so far from both Ventocilla’s native Peru and his adopted Cambridge, something went sour. The Indonesian police, instead of welcoming the newlyweds, detained Ventocilla and his husband, confiscating a herb grinder and other supposedly suspicious items from Ventocilla.
The exact sequence of events after that is unclear. We do know that Ventocilla was reportedly distressed in phone exchanges with his family, and that his mother desperately tried to contact the local consulate from Lima but proved unsuccessful. Tragedy was brewing.
By August 11th, after several days in police custody, Ventocilla was dead.
There are few words that can bring comfort, genuine comfort, in the face of such abject loss. Suffice it to say that we are profoundly saddened and angered by Ventocilla’s passing. We ache for Ana Ventosilla’s son, for Sebastián Marallano’s husband, and for everything else Ventocilla represented.
Rodrigo died too young yet got far, with a career defined by a steadfast commitment to the underserved and forgotten. Ventocilla was a staunch advocate for the LGBTQ+ and BIPOC communities throughout his life, and a founding member of the Peruvian trans rights advocacy organization Diversidades Trans Masculinas. He had worked for both the Peruvian Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the Bicentennial Schools Project, an initiative tasked with improving school quality. As a master student at the Harvard Kennedy School, he remained a resolute proponent of education and gender equity. Right before his honeymoon to Bali, Ventocilla was working in Johannesburg, South Africa, as part of the Harambee Youth Accelerator Program to implement a strategy for gender equity and social inclusion. If it weren’t for his passing, we are certain Ventocilla would have continued to make a difference — continued to make the world a slightly kinder, safer place for the most vulnerable, one small step at a time.
We are frustratingly less certain, however, about exactly why Ventocilla passed and of what role, if any, Bali’s police played in precipitating his death.
Ventocilla’s mother and husband seem far less hesitant. They have explicitly accused the Indonesian authorities of torturing and beating Ventocilla, exposing him to “physical and psychological violence”, and are now demanding an immediate autopsy of his repatriated body. While a conclusive account will only come with time, we cannot ignore the indications that a variety of deeply ingrained, reactionary biases played a role in his death. For starters, the criminalization of drugs such as marijuana, which led to Ventocilla’s arrest, has historically disproportionately targeted BIPOC and destabilized underresourced communities even to this day, while strengthening police and carceral institutions. Ventocilla’s own family has called the arrest and subsequent death an act of “racial discrimination and transphobia,” and we see scant reason to doubt their assessment. Discounting the potential role of discriminatory attitudes, particularly given the unclear circumstances surrounding his death (Indonesian officials have linked it to the consumption of suspiciously unseized drugs) would be shortsighted. Ventocilla didn’t ‘just happen to be trans’: His intertwined identities were a defining feature of his struggle and work, and exposed him, like millions of queer people of color, to a constant threat of violence and discrimination.
If his family is correct, that threat was fully realized with shocking cruelty this summer.
We believe that it is indeed fairly likely that Rodrigo’s activism and identity contributed to his premature death. His story, though particularly close to home, is hardly an outlier. In recent years, we have observed an alarming trend of rising anti-trans violence all across the globe, with 2021 being the deadliest year on record for transgender people. Discrimination and violence against transgender people also intersect with discrimination and violence against other communities, with transgender BIPOC particularly at risk of violent hate crimes. Even beyond Indonesia, with its particularly abysmal track record on queer rights, personal liberties seem rapidly shrinking: The US itself has seen a wave of anti-trans legislation, targeting everything from education to healthcare, over the past two years alone. In a bittersweet twist, Ventocilla’s death thus highlights the crucial character of the work he and other activists do in the face of daunting, sometimes lethal, opposition.
That fact, and the almost corollary responsibility to defend his legacy, ought to inform our response to Ventocilla’s passing. Mourning is not enough: We must do our best to honor and continue the work he believed in, furthering the causes he fought — and perhaps even died — for. We cannot let his death be in vain.
Rodrigo brought his fight for equality and dignity to Harvard’s halls of power and wealth. It’s only right that our institution fosters the courage to put its influence behind him now that he’s gone. Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf has already expressed support for Ventocilla’s family’s call for a thorough investigation, writing that their claims raise “very serious questions that deserve clear and accurate answers.”  Still, it is not enough for Harvard to simply agree that there are questions surrounding the nature of Ventocilla’s death that must be answered — Harvard must, to the greatest degree it possibly can, help facilitate those answers itself.
Doing so might include, for example, providing financial support for a family that has been deprived of one income earner and forced to confront extraordinary expenses while grieving. Additional, honorary investments must be on the table, including the creation of a  fellowship or academic program designed to honor Rodrigo that funds the heirs to his advocacy and activism. The University could even mobilize its substantial lobbying sway to help ensure that at the upcoming G20 Summit — set to take place in the setting of Rodrigo’s death, Bali, this November — the United States extracts answers regarding his passing. We hope, in particular, that U.S. Secretary of State and former Crimson Editor Antony J. Blinken ’84 will prioritize addressing Ventocilla’s final days, as well as the interrelated issues of police violence and queer safety.
Of course, all of the above are only palliative measures. We cannot offer true respite to those grieving Rodrigo — nothing barring a prompt and transparent investigation into his death will. But we also cannot stand idly by in the wake of Rodrigo’s death. Be it through public protests, financial support, or active lobbying, Harvard’s pursuit of Veritas should continue to include Ventocilla.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students flocked to Harvard Yard Friday to see musical duo Social House grace the stage at the College’s first in-person Crimson Jam in three years.
Crimson Jam — an annual fall concert organized by the College Events Board — returned to the Yard after it was held virtually in 2020 and postponed indefinitely in 2021 due to rising Covid-19 cases. Past Crimson Jam headliners include Jay Sean and Giveon.
“It’s honestly a throwback to freshman year because the last time this happened, we were freshmen, and it was the start of school,” Karly Hou ’23-’24 said. “We were just thinking about how excited we were.”
The concert, which followed the Student Organization Fair in Tercentenary Theatre, kicked off with four student acts before headliner Social House took the stage. Students enjoyed Mediterranean cuisine, carnival games, and even a choo-choo train in the Yard.
Hailing from Pittsburgh, Penn., Michael “Mikey” Foster and Charles “Scootie” Anderson compose musical duo Social House, known for their 2018 debut single “Magic In The Hamptons” featuring rapper Lil Yachty and their 2019 hit “Boyfriend” with pop singer Ariana Grande.
“Everyone was really just waiting for ‘Magic In The Hamptons’ — that’s what I was doing,” Abby R. Zachary ’25 said. “After they performed that song, everyone kind of dipped. I felt a little bit bad for the two of them, but I still had a good time.”
“I hope Social House felt the Harvard love,” Zachary added.
Nisha A. Seyed ’23 described the event as “wonderful” and expressed her appreciation for the College Events Board for organizing the concert.
“It shows their dedication in trying to build community again,” Seyed said.
Nicholas E. Kelly ’23, director of the CEB’s Arts and Entertainment Committee, touted Crimson Jam’s high turnout.
“This is our first Crimson Jam since being back from the pandemic, and so we’re really excited to reestablish that annual tradition,” Kelly said. “I think students had a blast.”
Many attendees praised the talent of the student openers — DJ Chaia, Charles Revival, Nikki Nicole & Friends, and Jaeschel — who performed covers and original songs.
“It’s just amazing the amount of talent that we have here on campus, and so it’s a real honor for me and my team to be able to showcase some of the talent,” Kelly said.
Though Taft L. Foley ’26 said Crimson Jam did not meet his expectations, he still enjoyed the concert.
“At the end of the day, I'm vibing with the homies,” Foley said. “I’m having a good time regardless.”

On the final weekend ahead of the Massachusetts state primaries on Tuesday, State Senator Eric P. Lesser ’07 returned to his old stomping grounds.
“It’s a little bit of a homecoming because I remember spending a lot of time here doing my own canvassing and door-knocking for candidates,” Lesser said on the steps of Harvard’s Boylston Hall on Saturday, where he addressed Harvard affiliates who volunteered for a handful of candidates making their final push ahead of Tuesday’s election.
Lesser, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, faces two other Democrats in the party’s primary for lieutenant governor on Tuesday.
Undergraduates with the Harvard College Democrats gathered to canvass for both the candidates their group endorsed, Lesser and Tanisha Sullivan, who is running for secretary of state.
A poll released last week by the University of Massachusetts Lowell shows Lesser trailing Salem Mayor Kim Driscoll in the race, but 30 percent of voters still remain undecided.
“This is a unique election since the overwhelming majority of people have no opinion right up until the end,” Lesser said. “That creates a really great opportunity to just run through the finish line—talking to as many people as you can, reaching out to as many people as you can.”
Lesser joined the College Democrats knocking doors in Cambridge.
“We really appreciate the student help,” he said. “Great to be in a familiar place as we get to the end of the end of the primary.”
Luke D. Albert ’22-’23, co-president of the Harvard College Democrats, said Lesser and Sullivan received “overwhelming support” during their endorsement process.
“It is always a crazy turnaround here at school, going from moving in to literally then having the Massachusetts state primaries,” he said.
Aaron Soroa-Alvarez, a regional organizer for Sullivan, said the progressive’s proposed election law changes would benefit students.
“I think students are really left out in Massachusetts when it comes to elections because we don’t have same-day registration,” he said.
Sullivan — who is facing longtime incumbent Secretary of State William F. Galvin — held a rally in Boston on Monday where she was joined by U.S. Rep. Ayanna S. Pressley (D-Mass.) and two Boston city councilors.
Many spectators are focused on Tuesday’s Democratic primary for attorney general between Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90 and Andrea J. Campbell.
Both candidates held events with their respective high-profile endorsers in Boston on Monday evening. Campbell, a former Boston city councilor and mayoral contender, was joined by Maura T. Healey ’92 — the presumptive Democratic nominee for Governor — while Liss-Riordan was accompanied by Boston Mayor Michelle Michelle Wu ’07.
On the Republican side, GOP gubernatorial hopeful Geoffrey G. Diehl held a virtual rally with former President Donald J. Trump on Monday. Chris Doughty, his more moderate primary opponent — who trailed in recent polls — appeared in Marlborough for the city’s Labor Day parade.
All eight members of Cambridge’s state legislative delegation — Representatives David M. Rogers, Marjorie C. Decker, Michael L. Connolly, Steven C. Owens, and Jay D. Livingstone and Senators Lydia M. Edwards, Patricia D. Jehlen, and Sal N. DiDomenico — are unopposed in their primary contests.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Association undertook its first major task since its formation in May by organizing the summer storage program, but some participants said the program was marred by confusion and disorganization.
Launched 2019 by the Undergraduate Council, the summer storage program offers students an affordable option for storing their belongings between academic years. The bill that brought this year’s iteration of the program to life came as the student body replaced its existing student government with the HUA, leaving the implementation of the program under new leadership.
“We couldn't just fully focus on working on the storage program,” HUA Residential Life Officer David Y. Zhang ’24 said. “There was reelection, all sorts of different things for people to focus on.”
Zhang, who also previously led the program as part of the Undergraduate Council, noted the increased size of the program added to the difficulties in organizing summer storage this year. According to Zhang, 1,623 undergraduates signed up for the program this summer, up from 526 in 2021.
When students who participated in the program picked up their belongings in August, some raised concerns about a lack of communication between the HUA and Five Star Movers, the storage company employed by the HUA.
Taruna Singh ’24 said Five Star Movers employees running the box pick-up on campus referred her to the company’s warehouse to retrieve her boxes. But employees at the warehouse sent her back to campus.
“I think it was handled really badly because I had to literally drive to the warehouse to go get my stuff, and they also had no idea about it,” Singh said. “The Five Star Movers guys didn’t have any communication with the [HUA].”
Talia G. Levitt ’25 said complications in picking up her boxes from the storage company meant she was not able to retrieve all her belongings until the first day of classes on Wednesday.
HUA Co-President LyLena D. Estabine ’24 blamed the moving company for sowing confusion about when students who missed their assigned pick-up day could receive their boxes.
“The moving company had taken it upon themselves without communicating with us to tell students that they were simply out of manpower — that they simply were refusing to bring back any more boxes and that students could either pick up their boxes directly from the storage company or they could wait until Saturday,” Estabine said.
She added that Five Star Movers complained to the HUA when “too many students” subsequently showed up to pick their boxes up at the company’s warehouse, and after a series of negotiations, the company agreed to bring all remaining boxes to campus on Aug. 31.
“We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience, and I know how terrible it is to expect your things and to not be able to receive them,” Estabine said. “I just issue my truly heartfelt apologies. But all I can say is that we tried our very best, and that sometimes companies go back on their word, unfortunately.”
Five Star Movers spokesperson Gilberto Ayala attributed the confusion to a "miscommunication" from the HUA in an emailed statement to The Crimson. The company originally planned to deliver boxes in batches across four days, he wrote.
"We later found out by some miscommunication an email had been sent out that stated we would have all the boxes from every student at Harvard for all four days and anyone would be able to come get their items at anytime," Ayala wrote. "We were made aware of this mistake after the email had been sent out and it left us scrambling to try to correct it. This left a lot of extra work for both us and students, to the point that we had to get one more day to deliver the rest of the boxes."
Adam Pearl ’25, who struggled to track down his boxes during the pick-up period, suggested relying on a different moving company could have helped the HUA avoid the chaos encountered this year.
“I think the moving company was a bit badly organized,” Pearl said.
HUA Co-President Travis A. Johnson ’24 acknowledged the shortcomings of the program but defended its benefits for the student body, saying that “the program wasn't perfect, but it was amazing.”
“I think it's really important to highlight that this program was beneficial to the students,” Johnson said. “It resulted in thousands of dollars — their personal hard earned money — being saved because they didn't have to go to an alternative storage unit.”
“We encourage all students to, you know, have patience and understanding with us as we continue to refine the system,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Chanting “Justice for Rodrigo,” nearly 100 protestors rallied outside the Peruvian consulate in Boston on Sunday to honor Rodrigo Ventocilla Ventosilla, a Harvard Kennedy School student from Peru who died in police custody in Indonesia last month.
The rally came three days after Peruvian prosecutors announced they had opened a preliminary investigation into the death of Ventocilla, a transgender man whose family says he was arrested by police in Bali in an “act of racial discrimination and transphobia.”
The rally in Boston, described as a “protest/vigil” by organizers, was held in solidarity with other events in Peru, Australia, and Indonesia on Sunday.
Michelle C. Poulin, who graduated from HKS in 2022, said they helped organize the rally because they wanted to share Ventocilla’s story.
“It was important for me to honor my friend and to honor an incredible person who has become a martyr for the trans community,” Poulin said. “I just want everyone to know about Rodrigo and to know what was done to him and to demand justice for what was done to him.”
Ventocilla died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Denpasar, five days after he was arrested upon arrival at the airport in Bali where he was traveling on a honeymoon with his spouse, Sebastián Marallano.
Police in Bali say Ventocilla was arrested for possession of items containing marijuana and later died from multiple organ failures after consuming unseized prescription drugs while in custody. But Ventocilla’s mother, Ana Ventosilla, alleged in an interview on Aug. 29 that her son and his spouse were tortured and suffered physical police violence at the hands of Indonesian authorities.
Stefanus Satake Bayu Setianto, head of public relations for the Bali Police, has denied allegations of police violence against Ventocilla and Marallano.
Peruvian prosecutors announced in a press release Thursday that they were investigating an “alleged crime against humanity, in the form of torture, to the detriment of Peruvian citizens Rodrigo Ventocilla and Sebastián Marallano,” following days of protests by LGBTQ+ rights organizations in Lima.
Julio Arbizu González, a lawyer representing Ventocilla’s family, wrote in a statement Monday that the investigation is “very important” because it would allow the family to “understand the dimension of the actions that constitute serious violations against human rights.”
“It is a large step towards learning the truth and finding those responsible for Rodrigo’s death,” Arbizu wrote.
An autopsy was conducted on Saturday, a day after Ventocilla’s body returned to Peru, according to a family representative, but the results have not been publicly released.
Arbizu wrote in the statement the autopsy was a “necessary step for the investigation, as it always is in crimes of torture,” but warned that the autopsy might not tell the complete story of what happened to Ventocilla in Indonesia.
“It must be remembered that the agent denounced for this crime can inflict cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment consciously, with both physical and psychological violence,” Arbizu wrote.
Cody J. Sanders, Harvard’s American Baptist chaplain, started the Sunday event by leading attendees in a prayer honoring Ventocilla and his legacy of activism for trans rights.
“In your remembering of Rodrigo, may his memory be a blessing to all he has helped to call together in community,” Sanders said. “And may his blessing be dangerous to all who stand against justice and all who would who would wish to do wrong to queer and trans folk, to BIPOC folk, and to the good doers of justice.”
Raquel Maldonado ’17, said they attended the rally to “demand justice and the truth” about Ventocilla’s death.
“Especially with trans experiences and trans lives, so many people are always lying about our experiences,” Maldonado said. “Getting the truth out there is important to know and be able to bear witness to what happened to him, and how it should not be happening in this world.”
Morgan K. Benson, an HKS student who graduated in 2022 and a co-organizer of the rally, told the crowd that Ventocilla enjoyed hosting gatherings for transgender and genderqueer graduate students Harvard.
“His apartment was just one of my favorite places to be,” Benson said. “He wasn’t a really good cook, but he was okay and he would always want to make food, and have beer, and just have everything everyone wanted.”
“So I miss that place,” Benson added. “It was at Peabody — so it was awful, but he made it amazing.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Nearly ten months ago, the Harvard field hockey team walked off Phyllis Oocker Field in Ann Arbor, Mich. as record breakers, making it to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in program history. The team stood undefeated in the Ivy League, beat both No. 2 Michigan and No. 6 Louisville 1-0 in overtime bouts during the tournament, and went 17-2 overall for the entire season.
After its astounding run to the national semifinals, the Crimson is no longer the underdog—it is the team to beat. Perhaps that is the most considerable difference this year: Harvard’s capability to win in major competition is not only sensed among top-level teams but has been proven over and over.
“In the past, we have normally put ourselves in an underdog position while we played top-level teams,” said head coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “It is a position we really cherish and we were comfortable with.”
“Still,” he added. “Right now, we are happy to be together, excited, but also very focused on another great season, which is definitely a lot more pressure than last year.”
Van Herwaarden’s players now know what they are up against — as do their competitors. Their consistent performances under pressure have created an expectation for success against top-level teams, something that was not present at the beginning of last season.
“People will come to play with a former Final Four team…they will come out to get us,” said the Ivy League Coach of the Year. “I think that is something that will challenge us and change the approach to the game for us…we are ready to take it on.”
But after losing two valuable players from its NCAA tournament run, the Crimson still has a major question to answer: who will step up to lead?
2022 graduates Hannah Pearce and Mimi Tarrant were two dominant players who played key leadership roles in the 2021 season. Pearce was named the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year and scored the Crimson’s lone goal in the NCAA Final Four game against title-winners Northwestern. Tarrant scored one of the three goals in the penalty shootout that sent Harvard to the semifinals for the first time in program history and played a crucial role in its offense.
“Our leadership has changed quite significantly,” van Herwaarden recalled. “That takes time to grow and takes time to develop. It's a process that will take us all the way into October.”
But the void of these two forces has been filled by the grace of seven incoming first-years—seven players who have already begun to make a sizable impact on the team. Alongside these first-years stands the rest of the strong team who each played a role in Harvard’s nearly unvanquished season last fall. Thanks in part to the contributions of its seven new players, Harvard stands at No. 7 in the National Field Hockey Coaches Association’s preseason poll.
“When big players leave, it creates the opportunity for other players to step up and I think that is what is happening for our team…so that’s really great to see, it's a natural process,” van Herwaarden noted. “To see how it pans out for the whole entire season of course takes time.”
Preseason training has given the Crimson a chance to adapt to this new mindset—how to approach the game as dominators, with new faces to replace the old ones. This new position will stand as a challenge for the team, but one that it has already started to rally against.
Just on Friday, the Crimson beat No. 24 Miami (Ohio) 1-0 in overtime on a penalty corner kick from first-year defender Bronte-May Brough, who took another three shots at Miami’s net earlier in the game as well.
“[It’s] phenomenal to see them fitting in well and already taking some specific roles on the field, especially in defense,” van Herwaarden remarked.
Hailed as one of the top defensive teams in all of D-I field hockey last season, Harvard’s defense should be strong once again. At the helm is All-Ivy First Teamer Ellie Shahbo, one of the best goalies in all of Division I.
Indeed, on Sunday, the Crimson’s defense was solid, but a late flurry of shots was not enough to make up the deficit against No. 15 University of Connecticut in a tough, 2-0 defeat at home.
“I think that the defense will always be one of our strengths,” van Herwaarden said. “At the same time, as we cherish that and keep working on those things, we of course want to strengthen our attacking unit.”
Some of that offensive strength will come from the incoming class, as well as from players who experienced the breadth and depth of top-notch competition during their NCAA tournament run.
“I can confidently say we’ve gained attacking power compared to last year,” the coach said.
The new challenge for the Crimson is a series of difficult games that will test its talent. Facing more talented teams and gaining new players will, van Herwaarden hopes, allow the team to display its strength once again.
“I can tell you that everybody is really excited, especially with the strength we have in our incoming class plus the experience from last year,” he said. “Time will tell.”
The gauntlet starts immediately, as Harvard will take on fellow national semifinalist No. 4 University of Maryland on Friday, Sept. 9 at 5 p.m., and No. 21 American at 11 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 11 in College Park, Md.

Note: This Flyby Tries™ article was written during the 2021-2022 Academic Year. In an effort to preserve the authenticity of the authors’ experience, it still reads in the present tense. 
Raymond and Annette are two students who are taking multiple p-set classes. As a result, they spend most of their time grueling over their homework at Cabot Library. In fact, they probably spend more time at Cabot than they do in their own dorms. One day, they had a groundbreaking idea to hold a Sleepover in Cabot because… why not? They were young, naive, and excited to make memories in their dorm away from dorm.
Here’s a rough timeline of what happened:
10:00 p.m. - Raymond and Annette arrive at Cabot, starting to regret their decision and feeling a little like their souls have been sucked out of their bodies. They have their room (LL06) booked from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. so they currently are camping out on the very colorful sofas, holding their pillows and sleeping bag and looking very stupid in their pajamas.
11:00 p.m. - They are finally in their room. They had a few close calls with both of them almost falling asleep but are determined to persevere until at least 1 a.m. so they can have a proper sleepover. They also had to kick two guys who had been using the room out. Sorry!
Raymond and Annette also find this mess on one of the chairs. To this day, they still do not know what it is. They do not want to know.
11:17 p.m. - Annette is starving but she has already brushed her teeth and is unable to consume anything other than the freezing cold water from the Cabot library water bottle filling station. She begins to play Christmas music to cope (this endeavor took place in October). Just to add to the ambiance, Raymond begins to play his LS1a learning pod video out loud.
11:37 p.m. - Raymond and Annette’s friend, Jayden E. Personnat ’25, visits and laughs at them. He then proceeds to leave to have a good night’s sleep in the comfort of his own bed. Godspeed.
11:44 p.m. - Raymond finally finishes his LS1A learning pod video. Go, Raymond!
11:52 p.m. - Their other friend (yes, they have more than one friend) Agustín J. León-Sáenz ’25 comes to visit like the supportive friend he is.
12:06 a.m. - Annette and Raymond wonder: Why does Stanford have all the hot people?
12:11 a.m. - “She’s like thawing,” said Agustín referring to Mariah Carey in the weeks leading up to the holidays, of course.
12:26 a.m. - Raymond and Annette attempt to educate Agustín on Taylor Swift’s music, starting off strong with “Enchanted.” It turns out that Agustín enjoys “Christmas Tree Farm.” Do what you will with this information.
12:43 a.m. - They start listening to Nessa Barrett songs for… some reason. They’re in paaaaiiiiin.
12:45 a.m. - No more Nessa Barrett songs.
12:52 a.m. - “I like that laugh HEHEHEHEHEHE.”
12:55 a.m. - They are listening to early quarantine songs… Why don’t you say so? This lasts for a while.
1:32 a.m. - Karaoke session ensues. Also, Kidz Bop.
1:43 a.m. - Friendship ended with Agustín and Annette because Raymond found out they do not like “Bob’s Burgers” (AKA Raymond digs himself deeper into a deep, dark hole by admitting he likes “Bob’s Burgers.”)
1:48 a.m. - Friendship ended with Agustín and Annette again because Agustín confused “Bob’s Burgers” with “South Park” and Annette confused “Bob’s Burgers” with “Family Guy.” Sorry (not really). In Annette and Agustín’s defense, it was late.
1:51 a.m. - Agustín leaves Raymond and Annette. All alone, once more.
1:56 a.m. - Annette gains a lithp via retainer (shoutout to all the people who’ve had braces and feel her pain).
2:02 a.m. - Raymond makes an absolutely groundbreaking discovery. He’s out of breath due to his rush to write this down. His voice shakes. The first-floor Cabot bathroom sink no longer scalds you when you use it for more than five seconds. (The next day, he learns that this was just a fluke, and he goes back to being sad.)
2:05 a.m. - Annette finds out that everything is a lie. Raymond is a fraud: He was not born and raised in Brooklyn like he so proudly proclaims (For clarification, he was born in Manhattan and raised in Brooklyn, so he’s only a half fraud at most). But at least Raymond is not a Queens resident like Annette.
2:14 a.m. - Raymond and Annette ask each other questions from a Teen Vogue quiz for best friends. They discuss high school crushes, gossip about people, and major life questions like concentration ideas, what they want to do after graduating, and how they can most easily become TikTok famous and drop out.
3:49 a.m. - They head to bed — or more like Annette heads to the floor while Raymond makes an unsound makeshift bed out of three chairs.
6:00 a.m. - Annette wakes up thinking the night is over. Unfortunately, there are two more hours of sleeping on the hard floor.
7:51 a.m. - Raymond wakes up sad, shivering, and sore.
8:00 a.m. - Annette and Raymond get up and face the walk of shame back to their dorms. There are quite a few people in the basement of Cabot at this early hour, and they realize people could definitely see them sleeping through the window.
Here’s what Annette and Raymond learned from their Sleepover in Cabot: 
Don’t do a sleepover in Cabot.
It’s never too early to play Christmas music.
Don’t do a sleepover in Cabot. Just don’t do it. Go back to your dorm. Sleep in your (bigger) bed.
But if you’re really adamant, here’s their advice: 
Bring a sleeping bag like Annette did—in fact, bring multiple sleeping bags *and* many, many pillows to cushion you from the cold, hard Cabot floor. Or maybe just sleep on one of those sofa chairs.
Bundle up and wear warm clothes because it can get cold.
Reserve a room for a good portion of the night so you aren’t bothered.
And last, but certainly not least, if you’re going to subject yourself to suffering, make sure you bring along a couple of friends so at least you’re all suffering together.
