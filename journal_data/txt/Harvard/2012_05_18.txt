After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 23, 2012, at 2:11 p.m.
Associate professor of medicine R. Paul Johnson has been appointed the new interim director of the New England Primate Research Center after former director Frederick Wang resigned, following the death of four primates in the Harvard Medical School laboratories.
The announcement was made in a letter on Monday from Jeffrey S. Flier, dean of Harvard Medical School.
Johnson will assume the position as interim director at a precarious moment for the Center. In the last two years, the deaths of nine animals across several separately registered Harvard-affiliated research facilities—four of which were primates—caused an outcry among animal rights activists and the Harvard community.
In the wake of the deaths, NEPRC began an overhaul of its policies and procedures, revising quality control and operations during the last few months.
Flier acknowledged the recent controversy in the letter announcing Johnson’s appointment. “Over the past several months, enormous progress has been made at NEPRC, resulting from a comprehensive needs analysis and the implementation of an action plan designed to help ensure the health and welfare of the Center’s primates,” Flier wrote in an e-mail according to the Boston Globe.
Flier said that Johnson was selected in part to shepherd these changes while the Center searches for a permanent director.
Johnson has served as a leading researcher in HIV and SIV, the strain found in non-human primates, for the past twenty years. His research group, which is comprised of three postdoctoral fellows and a graduate student, focuses on immunological responses to the disease and treatment within these organisms.
“Paul has been an integral member of the team contribution to this transformation,” wrote Flier. “I am confident that through his ongoing leadership we will continue the rigorous and ongoing process of quality improvement at the Center, while fostering a culture of transparency.”

CORRECTION: May 19, 2012
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that nine animals have died at the New England Primate Research Center. In fact, as of January, nine animals had died over the past two years at Harvard-affiliated research facilities, and four of those deaths took place at NEPRC.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The prize for the very best thesis in the Harvard senior class went to two students this year, one who proposed ways to address cholera epidemics in Haiti for her thesis and another who wrote a collection of poems.
Victoria E. Koski-Karell ’12 and Justin B. Wymer ’12 were chosen for the Captain Jonathan Fay Prize from among the 81 recipients of the Thomas T. Hoopes Prize, an honor for outstanding scholarly work or research, generally senior theses.
When the Fay Prize was awarded Thursday, the selection committee commented on the winners’ different concentrations.
“Their fields of study, anthropology and poetry, are very different, but we found that both students shared an exemplary commitment to original, inquisitive, and rigorous work,” Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study Lizabeth Cohen said in a press release.
A social anthropology concentrator, Koski-Karell explored the impact of the cholera epidemic that broke out in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010.
Koski-Karell, who has traveled to Haiti six times in the past four years, said that she grew up knowing the history and culture of the country because her father wrote his Masters and Ph.D. disserations on archaeology in Haiti.
According to the press release, the selection committee acclaimed Koski-Karell’s thesis for its “originality of research” and practical suggestions that “will save lives.”
For her research on the economic, political, and social implications of the epidemic, Koski-Karell interviewed patients, family members, caregivers, and healthcare providers in northern Haiti.
“Ethnographic research is effective and meaningful because the whole idea behind it is that you are speaking to people and listening to their stories and narratives about their experiences,” she said.
She said that she hoped to give a human voice to sufferers who do not easily have the opportunity to speak to a global audience. After graduation, she plans to continue her cholera advocacy as an intern for Physicians for Haiti.
Wymer, an English concentrator, wrote a creative thesis titled “Genius Loci” which showcases 51 poems that “translate the spirit and emotion of different places into certain clusters of imageries,” he said. He wrote about places including New York City, his West Virginia home, and Currier House.
The selection committee lauded Wymer’s work for “pushing poetry in a strange and shocking direction” with a “fresh, original voice,” according to the press release.
Wymer’s adviser, poetry professor Jorie Graham, called the thesis “one of the most remarkable collection of poems I have seen from a young poet at Harvard” in the press release.
Wymer said that the honor was completely unexpected, especially because he believed that the Fay Prize typically went to theses that focus on social advocacy.
“It is an honor to get an affirmation for a work of art, and knowing that the emotions I felt have also affected others,” he said.
Wymer, who will head to the prestigious Iowa Writers’ Workshop after graduation, said that he hopes to continue writing poems and to become a writing instructor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The juggernaut social media website Facebook was once the property of four Harvard classmates. On Friday, it will now be shared not four ways but more than 421 million ways.
The website, which has accrued more than 900 million users since its launch from a Harvard dorm room in 2004, plans to go public on Friday. Two days ahead of the slated initial public offering, the company announced that it would expand the number of shares it will offer by 25 percent, bringing the total traded shares to 421 million.
The IPO will be one of the largest in financial history, and Facebook stands to raise more than $18 billion as investors buy the company’s shares on the traded markets. 
 
Brokerage companies, which handle stock trades for investors, have been overrun by high demand for Facebook shares. In fact, Morgan Stanley, TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, and other brokerage companies stopped accepting orders on Thursday.
Seeing the high investor demand for Facebook shares, the company raised the price of its stocks from $34 to $38 on Thursday morning. At the new price, the company could be valued as high as $104 billion.
