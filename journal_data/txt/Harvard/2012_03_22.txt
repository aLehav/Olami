After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Monday, the Cambridge City Council voted to extend the contract of city manager Robert W. Healy for 15 months. Having served in his current position since 1981, Healy will retire at the end of his contract extension. This time is intended to be a period of transition while a new city manager is trained.
Healy has done a great service to the city during his tenure and we wish him well in his retirement. Even still, this moment of transition—the first in more than thirty years—provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the position of city manager and the structure of Cambridge city governance.
As Cambridge residents, our experience tells us that Cambridge is a well-run city. Public property is extremely well maintained, and repairs are carried out promptly. The City Council—which appoints and oversees the office of city manager—is one of the most forward-looking in the country, as demonstrated by their decision to compensate married LGBT couples for lost benefits due to the Federal Defense of Marriage Act. Having served for over three decades, Healy has, at times, been the object of some criticism. In fact, three of Cambridge’s nine city councilors voted not to extend his contract, due in part to grievances over his performance. Nevertheless a strong majority did support the extension, signaling that even at the end of his tenure he maintains the faith of his employers.
While it may be tempting to find issue in the extremely long tenures of city managers like Healy, it is important to remember that the office is administrative rather than political in nature. Indeed, it is part of the position’s very design that it be removed from the yearly whims of city politics. The fact of the matter is that city managers are concerned with the day-to-day upkeep of the municipality, not the political direction of its leadership. Furthermore, the Cambridge city manager serves at the pleasure of the City Council: if they find Cambridge’s chief executive to be falling short in his or her duties, they have the ability to hire a new one.
Additionally, we must be careful not to fetishize short tenures. As with most positions, an individual’s ability to perform the role of city manager improves with experience. High turnover would more likely lead to sloppy management than anything else. All the reasons that term limits exist for other officials have no relevance when applied to the office of city manager. There is no risk of despotism from an administrator accountable to the City Council, and no reason to believe that performance diminishes with age.
Of course, as with any job, the mechanisms for accountability ought to work effectively. The key to ensuring high-quality performance from a city manager lies not in term limits or pay cuts, but rather in the alert oversight of the City Council. That said, the notoriously generous compensation of the Cambridge city manager ought to prompt some review of the office. While it’s true that a high salary alone does not signify a lack of oversight, the office is one of the few in the world that comes with a yearly pension close to $300,000.
City Manager Healy has spent much of his adult life in the service of this city. We salute him in advance of his retirement, and hope that the people of Cambridge and the City Council take this opportunity to look critically at the office of city manager.

No, this isn’t another column about your duty to complain @Twitter and like the right videos on Facebook so that you can start your own grassroots political movement between response papers; it’s a column about real, active participation in the legislative process, so keep reading.
In the 21st century, political participation should mean a lot more than its traditional definition of fundraising, letter-writing, and the occasional vote. However, it should also mean a lot more than just promoting some of your thoughts on your friends’ newsfeeds. No doubt, a lot of credit is due to social media for movements like the Arab Spring in places where people have no political voice and the old-school media is perhaps even less democratic than the government. But this is ’Murrrca, dammit! In a functional democracy where legislators really do—for the most part—want to hear and represent their constituents as best they can, we have the luxury to do a lot more with the internet than trend a few of our scattered emotions in hopes that someone important will notice and start a discussion in the analog world.
My premise is this: screaming about something in the digital universe is hardly the best way to make your voice heard in a tangible way. It’s certainly an important tool for generating exposure—even in free societies where your voice is only one of many—but unless the Internet gods decide to take your post viral, you’re just another statistic trending along with everyone else, and an ambiguous one, at that. Even if ten million people tweet, for instance, #justlikebieber, who knows whether the kid is loved or loathed? I’ve learned the hard way that the Internet has never been good with sarcasm or nuance. But there’s an alternative—one that has the power to revolutionize the way legislation itself is crafted and its quality, too. This week, I’d like to Karthink about that.
Probably the greatest thing to emerge out of last season’s Stop Online Piracy Act fiasco was a little bill called the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act. I’m a huge fan of protecting intellectual property, and I’m proud to say I buy all my music online for triple Amazon rewards points. I haven’t actually read OPEN, so I don’t know how I feel about it yet, but that’s neither here nor there. The bill’s true innovation is—for lack of a better word—its wikification.
On December 8, shortly after OPEN’s sponsors finished its first draft, they made the visionary decision to post the text online at keepthewebopen.com. The website’s well-designed platform, named Madison after the founding father himself, gave anyone who wanted it the ability to attach a comment or suggest a revision to any individual clause of the bill. It displayed the two types of feedback separately, was connected to Facebook, and allowed users to vote on, tweet, or otherwise share what they saw.
A little over a month later, on January 18, the sponsors introduced an updated version of the bill on the House floor that actually took into account user comments and even included several of the better user-generated revisions. The updated bill was then reposted to the website for further public revision with the user-generated improvements that had already been implemented highlighted in blue.
This unusual measure is an amazing development in American politics. Rather than combing through mountains of tweets and Facebook posts to find the rare good idea that could then be transformed into workable legislation, Senators Darrell E. Issa and Ron L. Wyden, who introduced the bill, simply had to browse a list of specific, targeted recommendations to harvest popular expertise and innovation. Granted, Madison finds its maximal utility much farther along in the legal process than social media, but its impact on government by the people, for the people has the potential to be much more forceful.
It’s hard to imagine a future in which almost all bills are not open for public revision for some period of time. Not only would it allow Congress to access a much broader marketplace of ideas directly, but interest groups, affected parties, and the citizenry more broadly would also all have the best means yet of taking a real level of ownership over the legal process that is nominally their own. Moreover, in time, the current regime of legalese that hobbles public understanding of the written law might gradually fade away. The end result would me a more transparent, democratic, effective, and popular government.
The internet is finally sophisticated enough to provide a tool that allows us to contribute to the law in a much deeper way. The technology has been in place for over two decades, but the popular will to use the internet as a political tool has exploded just in the last few years. With both the means and the wherewithal, the people can now serve as a true fourth branch of government, or at least as a third chamber of Congress. Actually, maybe more of a subcommittee, but the point stands. New avenues for participation such as Madison definitely need refining, but already represent a promising way to let experts and laypeople alike do more to help their legislators craft better, more relevant, and more democratic law.

Being detained by foreign police isn’t on a typical spring break agenda. Then again, the West Bank isn’t a typical destination. As members of the fifth annual Palestine Trek—a student-organized trip to the West Bank and Israel—we witnessed injustices perpetuated by Israel’s occupation of Palestine. There, we experienced a police encounter that has been inaccurately represented in the media. Following the incident in which Israeli authorities detained the group, news outlets reported that we were “provocateurs.” Some claimed we were arrested. The Israel-based newspaper Haaretz, published that the road was “for security vehicles only,” calling the alleged offense a “violation in every sense.” For us, the events illustrated adversities Palestinians face daily under occupation.
Tuesday morning, our group of over 50 Harvard students traveled to Al-Walaja in the West Bank to understand the tensions between Israel and Palestine that have been exacerbated by the Wall and unlawful Israeli settlements. Adjacent to the village sits the Jewish settlement Har Gilo, which is illegal under international law as Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits an occupying force from moving its citizens onto occupied land. Although the International Court of Justice and every government except Israel acknowledges this, settlements continue to expand into Palestinian land. Their populations grow by 5.7 percent annually, and only a small number have ever been dismantled, due to an international body unwilling to hold Israel responsible for its violations. Citing security concerns, Israel has constructed a wall through Al-Walaja, creating a cleavage within the village, which defies the internationally recognized 1967 borders.
The public road through Al-Walaja where we stopped was unsigned and unmarked. Students stepped off the bus to gain a clearer view of the area as our guide Shireen al-Araj—a local activist—showed large unmanned gaps in the structure, contradicting Israel’s ubiquitous justification that the wall is for “security purposes.”
Minutes after we disembarked, two police vehicles approached us. Four officers carrying assault rifles demanded we return to our vehicle and leave the area. When asked why we were being expelled, an officer responded, “because I said so.” In subsequent statements to the media, they reported that we were on a restricted military road.
However, several non-military cars were present, and in most circumstances, declaring areas as military zones requires official documentation and road signs. Wednesday, the Office of the Quartet Representative, Tony Blair, confirmed via email that the area remains open to the public, noting that they have taken many visitors there without incident, including the day prior.
As we retreated, an officer pushed several students toward the bus. They seized identification from Palestinians traveling with us, and placed Shireen and the bus driver under arrest. We were told we would be taken to a nearby checkpoint to be searched. Two officers boarded the bus as the police vehicles escorted us to the checkpoint. When asked why we were being detained, one responded, “I don’t know,” and later refused to answer. At the checkpoint, Shireen was driven from the premises and later released. No Harvard students were searched or arrested.
As individuals who emerged unscathed, we wish to highlight not what happened to us, but the appalling trend from which this incident stems. Our hour-long encounter with the police was insignificant, yet because we are an international group, the incident was widely publicized. Our detainment is not the important narrative. We were never in danger, but Israel’s misuse of authority means the Palestinians with us could have been jailed indefinitely under martial law. Instead of our story, those of countless Palestinians forbidden from entering their original homes, detained at checkpoints for hours every day, and living in homes with demolition orders should be told.
The police arbitrarily declared the road a military zone. They claimed we participated in illegal activity though they neither cited signs nor provided required documents to justify their assertions. These realities illustrate the oppressive power imbalance that belittles an entire population.
We were appalled by the actions of Israeli authorities and the ensuing media coverage that frames us as protesters attempting to provoke authorities. In a Crimson interview, Assistant Dean of the College Jay Ellison incorrectly stated that we were photographing “areas [we] weren’t supposed to photograph (military installations, etc),” a claim that remains unsubstantiated. In fact, there were no military installations, and the photographer Anne Paq, who initially reported our detainment, was working in the same area without consequence. The media response to the events has undermined the truth and distorted innocent voices of people like Shireen who seek justice. We have become objects of a culture of impunity that has allowed the occupation to occur with little backlash.
We call on fellow students to listen to these untold stories. The oppressive and stagnant status quo must be reformed; this can only be done when the international community holds Israel accountable for its transgressions. The first step to initiate real change is to open our eyes to the realities of the situation, beyond the one-sided version Israel promotes.

Anyone taking Societies of the World 44: Human Trafficking, Slavery and Abolition in the Modern World this semester will tell you that the days of coerced labor and extreme violations of human dignity are far from over. My visit to Kuwait this January gave me further insight into this depressing reality that is all too common in the Gulf region. The fusion of oil wealth and traditional mores has allowed for a modern day system of slavery, and until the development an alternative fuel, or the exhaustion of the region’s oil, no amount of advocacy will be able to put an end to it.
To give Kuwait some credit, the social welfare system for citizens is highly impressive. Unlike nations where mineral wealth is exploited, creating a wealth divide between a ruling minority and an impoverished majority, Kuwait redistributes its wealth to the citizens. Along with guaranteed employment, free medical services, occasional “debt forgiveness” policies, retirement income, marriage bonuses, and free education, Kuwaiti citizens also receive frequent monetary payment from the government simply for being citizens. In February of 2011, for example, the government gave each citizen 1,000 Kuwaiti Dinars (approximately $3,500) and each family a free monthly food basket. The caveat in this case is the term citizen. “Original Kuwaiti nationals” are those who settled, or haves ancestors who settled, in Kuwait prior to 1920. The Kuwaiti government makes it virtually impossible for any one else to become a citizen.
As a result of Kuwaitis being paid to do nothing, the workforce is comprised of individuals from those nations that failed to become wealthy on oil deposits. However, these immigrants, who are permanently tied to an alien status and socially isolated due to a lack of Arabic or English knowledge, must also endure harsh immigration laws referred to as the “sponsorship system.” Non-Kuwaitis wishing to work in the country are required to have an employer sponsor, who is then responsible for facilitating legal paperwork between the expatriate and the government. The sponsor must also determine whether the former is acting within Kuwait’s legal framework. Expatriates are unable to leave their jobs without permission from their employers, thus enabling employee abuse and exploitation. Kuwait announced plans to abolish the sponsor system by February 2011, but Rose, an immigrant from the Philippines and employee at a small bakery in Kuwait City affirms that such a system is still very much intact. Rose frowns and looks down sadly as she says to me, “they do not see us as equals.” A few seconds later, as if on queue, a Kuwaiti woman interrupts our conversation and summons Rose from her cupcake business, so she can find her a pen. According to Kuwait Times, the sponsorship system is still in place because the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor claims “clear steps” have not been taken or proposed and former members of Parliament wish to maintain it.
“What is the point of writing about this struggle,” asked Noel, a mall stand employee and immigrant from India, “No one can help us. This is a country just for the Kuwaitis.”  Noel explains that when Bangladeshi immigrants “raised their voices” to United Nations representatives about monthly wages of 15 Kuwaiti Dinars (approximately $50), the Kuwaiti government put a ban on visas for Bangladeshis. In 2008, the Kuwaiti government deported several Bangladeshis who protested against monthly wages as lows as eight Kuwaiti Dinars (approximately $30) a month. Despite unfair wages and working conditions, Noel says, immigrants continue coming to Kuwait for their “daily bread.” The real victims are the immigrants who work in Kuwaiti households. These immigrants, most commonly women, along with being subject to the lowest pay also often endure physical and sexual abuse and face difficulty escaping the grasps of their “sponsors.” Rose agrees that treatment is worst in the houses. Kuwaiti employers count the household’s food, she explains, and maids are beaten if anything is missing. They are often allowed only three or four hours of sleep. If they are able to, many domestic servants often attempt to escape to the Philippine embassy where they are either sent back to the Philippines or given the opportunity to contact their sponsor and ask for another employer.
Fawaz Al-Alami, former Saudi negotiator with the World Trade Organization, argues human rights abuses are a natural occurrence and not reason enough to abolish a system of national population control. I am not arguing that Kuwait and other Gulf Nations should simply grant citizenship to anyone who wants it, but this system is inherently abusive. Immigrants in every country undoubtedly face hardships, but the combination of a institutionalized notion of a superior race, the sponsorship system, and virtually no effective laws or government monitoring policies to relieve immigrant workers of these abuses bring the concept of human rights abuse to a new level. The worst part is the Kuwaiti government will tout the generosity of allowing immigrants into their nation. But it is highly unlikely that a single Kuwaiti citizen knows how to mop a floor, let alone comprise an actual labor force that the country can rely on.

I shield my eyes from the glaring sun streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows in Quincy dining hall. I scan the room three or four times before I spot my savior.
He always arrives before I do. He sits perfectly still at the end of one of the long tables and nods in my direction. We say hi. I ask—for the fourth time—if he’s still thinking of declaring computer science. I make the same joke I made last week, the kind of joke a middle-aged father would make, about how he’ll graduate with more marketable skills than I will.
My tutor for Computer Science 50 is a sophomore. I met him three weeks earlier when the Bureau of Study Counsel matched us up. He politely inquires about my thesis meeting earlier that morning.
Within 30 seconds, I have opened my laptop and we are down to business. Throughout the next four and a half hours, five different groups of friends eat lunch beside us and I overhear snippets of their comparatively trivial conversations: final clubs, essays, a recent football game. It is as if my tutor and I are frozen in time while the rest of the world keeps moving in rapid forward motion.
Our arrangement is to work on the problem set for two hours each Tuesday­—two hours with my tutor is the equivalent of 15 hours on my own. But this week I have a job interview, a thesis deadline, and a paper, and I need more time with him.
He stops me. “What’s the number one mistake of beginning programmers?” He cracks a smile. I have already made this same error so many times in three weeks that it has become our catchphrase, our inside joke. In order to signify equality in this programming language, you need two equal signs next to each other, and I’ve only put one. We laugh. I’ve made it clear by now that we can and should laugh at my clumsiness at the keyboard and inability to transfer most of what I’ve learned from week to week—I give up; I sort of see no alternative to humor.
We dive back into the problem set and he walks me through each line of its specifications. He already knows the exact line of code I’ll need but makes me come up with it myself. Often he must force it out of me—he is much more adamant that I actually learn the material than I am. It is a painfully slow process: he somehow manages to translate the foreign language on the computer screen into English, telling a story. Drawing charts and pictures, his notebook becomes a children’s book full of scrawled numbers and buckets—he tells me they store shapes and numbers like a computer stores memory. He re-teaches math I haven’t seen since the calculus I learned in high school.
At 2:10 p.m., we realize the servery is about to close. I have ignored a quietly growling stomach for the past two hours, my need to take advantage of every precious minute of help much greater than my need for food. We break for approximately three minutes. I shovel food onto my plate without looking, anxious to get back to work.
Back at home in Currier, I’m much more deliberate about the food on my plate. Ana, who runs the grill, no longer makes me fill out an order form but remembers, without fail, to put cheese on my garden burger. My thesis adviser, with whom I have worked one-on-one for more than a year, text messages me on a regular basis. Most of my nine roommates have lived with me for so long that they can imitate with frightening accuracy my lame dance moves at parties. But next year, I won’t have nine roommates to come home to anymore, and for the first time in 17 years, I won’t be a student.
By 4:30 p.m. in Quincy, I am more than three-quarters done with the problem set and we call it a day. Accustomed to the post-pset headache, my fingers find their way to my bulging temples to massage the pain. I don’t quite know how to thank him: our work today could mean one less night of CS office hours, aggressively shoving my way to the front of the line and sweet-talking TFs. This week I might only need to beg my linkmate for two hours of his Thursday night to help me debug and submit.
I leave the dining hall exhausted but happy and pass the same yard I’ve been walking through every day for the past four years. CS50 may be over for good—like senior year will be soon—but if the class has taught me anything, it’s that I won’t be done asking people for help.

Even if Libby and I have different ideas of what a “walk” entails, we both love our visits to Manor Park, a local woodsy, rocky, seaside paradise. When I tell Libby, my five-year-old black lab puppy, that we’re going on a walk, her nose lifts up and her tail wags ferociously.
In high school, reaching Manor Park meant that I had completed another two miles of my run. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve gotten my Manor Park fix from long walks with Libby. Like me, Libby likes to climb on the rocks, but I can’t let her do it too much because if she goes in the water I’m not strong enough to pull her back out. I like to stop and look out at the view, sometimes of Long Island and sometimes of the other houses across the shoreline. Libby likes to stop and catch her breath. When I’m home from college, our lives are remarkably similar. Libby and I both spend most of the day lying around on the couch—though neither of us should.
Sometimes Libby wants to play in the front or backyard, but not when it’s raining because rain scares her. She never seems to lose the thrill of having her electric collar removed, though her enthusiasm is for the opportunity to sniff trees for the scent of other dogs rather than to actually exercise.
When I was very young, it was the gazebos that would catch my eye. In middle school, I once went over to Manor Park to have a look at the waves during Hurricane Isabel. And in high school, the park became the finishing point of my run.
I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of escape. It’s not that I ever felt the need to run away from what I had—what was there to flee? Suburbia? A loving family? I just always liked the idea of exploring new terrain. I would play Lynyrd Skynyrd’s “Freebird” while on the way to and from school and go on runs through the nearby nature center.
And I’ve continued to visit Manor Park with my dog to look out at the horizon, to enjoy impromptu playdates with other dogs, and to improve my arm strength by yanking Libby’s leash when she stops to sniff the ground for the hundredth time.
Libby and I see that there is a whole world out there for us to explore.And then we head back home because it looks like it’s going to rain, and we’re both getting hungry.

There is no game quite like Skyrim. With a myriad of choices—from a character’s species to specialized skills and play styles, factions they ally with or fight against, and a massive open world to explore both above and below ground—the game doesn’t push a player in one direction so much as it sets them free to do whatever they want. Sure, it’s not the first medieval fantasy game to feature dungeons and dragons, but there is nothing quite like it either.
Developed by Bethesda Studios, and released on Nov. 11 of last year (a coveted 11/11/11 release date), the roleplaying game has sold millions of copies worldwide.
“Skyrim is what you make of it,” Felix L. Wu ’14 says. “I wouldn’t call it a sandbox. It’s not like Grand Theft Auto. It’s sort of like a Lego set, you get what I mean? Lego sets have instructions, you build things with them and then you mix them with other Lego sets that you have and start doing your own thing.”
“If we estimate about a very conservative estimate of two hours a week since it came out...I would not be surprised if I’ve already played 50 hours,” Wu guesses.
WILL THE REAL DARK ELF PLEASE STAND UP?
Because of the game’s incredible flexibility, the character a player creates and the way he plays can give players an outlet to an alternate reality­ of sorts—and can even say a lot about who the player is.
Amil A. Jayasuriya ’14 estimates that he has spent approximately 30 hours playing the game. “I played as one of the regular people...not the Nord. The Imperials.”
Jayasuriya’s roommate Allen J. Macleod ’14 has a slightly different style of character creation. “I employ a color-blind selection process so I don’t see race,” he jokes. “No, uh, I am a Dark Elf? I think? Wow, if I had to pick the one thing that sounded the nerdiest....”
But despite the nerdy feelings we all feel when discussing our gaming habits, Skyrim’s mainstream status is difficult to ignore. Wu indicates some surprise at the game’s ability to gain widespread appeal. “A number of my friends, who I wouldn’t expect to play Skyrim or enjoy it, actually enjoy it,” he claims. “It’s still a video game, of course, but it feels less like the standard sort of familiarized storyline shooter whatever video game. It’s an explorative, choose-your-own-adventure sort of thing.”
That freedom to do whatever, whenever makes Skyrim the antithesis of games like Call of Duty, which tells a single story in a single, specific way. In fact, many players disregard what would be considered Skyrim’s main narrative thread in favor of exploring their own interests.
“I basically just abandoned the main plot and just went to find words,” Macleod says, referring to dragon shouts that the player can discover throughout the game in order to gain unique, powerful abilities.
Similarly, Jayasuriya completely avoided the game’s main line of quests in order to join the Dark Brotherhood, a guild of assassins and a standout faction from Skryim’s predecessor, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. “I played Oblivion, and the thing I liked the most about that was the Dark Brotherhood,” he says. In Oblivion, the player could be recruited by the Dark Brotherhood by murdering an innocent person. “And so, on day one, me and [my friend James] went around murdering a town trying to get into the Dark Brotherhood, but that’s not how you get into it in this game, so...we just murdered a town.”
“I actually intentionally started off by ignoring the main quest line and doing the College of Winterhold line,” Wu says, “to essentially gain access to all the spells, all the people that could teach me skills.” He spent much of his time leveling up his skills of Conjuration and Destruction magic in order to play entirely as a mage, a class of characters that uses magic, unlike a thief who specializes in stealth or a warrior who solves problems with brute force.
“In some ways, I’ve been playing this almost as if I was actually trying to follow a standard mage storyline,” he explains. “Like a questing mage who’s searching for the inner secrets of magic. I’m not closely doing that necessarily, but I definitely have that in mind when I’m playing; that I’m not a warrior by any means.”
JA, RULES
But even within the game’s incredibly nonrestrictive rule set, there are certain rules to which each player holds himself. “One rule I impose on myself is to find the secret of the town and get myself into that organization as quickly as possible,” Jayasuriya says, explaining how each city plays host to some sort of faction or group. Riften, a city in the southeast corner of the game’s map, plays host to the Thieves Guild, a perfect host for Jayasuriya’s stealth-focused character. “It does a good job bringing you right into the world. Almost without a choice, you learn about what’s happening in a city. And you get an image of the social dynamic with the city.”
“The game does do a good job of portraying characters that are more innocent and more annoying,” Jayasuriya says. “So as a rogue, when you have the ability to pickpocket or assassinate without really getting into too much trouble, you’re never gonna go after the caravan that’s outside of town where they’re struggling to survive.” Even among thieves, a man/lizard-man/dark elf/anthropomorphic cat must have a code.
While some players focus on combat or stealth, other players focus on exploring the massive digital landscape. When I tell Wu that my style is to turn the difficulty all the way down so that I never have to worry about dying and losing progress, he gets where I’m coming from. “I understand that,” he nods. “One of my friends has been doing more explorative sort of play. He had one save that was accidentally saved over by someone. But then he started another one—totally different—playing as an Argonian, who no one plays as, running around with two maces doing ridiculous things.
“He’s been trying out all the fun things. Playing a werewolf all the time,” he describes. “Just rushing into things without giving a crap.”
Skyrim’s lack of strict rules of play gives the player flexibility to do whatever he chooses. The infinite number of wooden bowls populating the game’s environments are of no use in combat or trade, but to Wu they are indicative of the game’s freedom. “If I wanted to, I could sell every wooden bowl I find, and that could just be something I do, and there’s no one stopping me from doing something like that,” Wu says.
There is a social element to Skyrim, as the uniqueness of each player’s game makes it ripe for discussion. “It’s definitely fun watching and helping somebody else along,” Jayasuriya says.
“[My roommates and I] are all playing different styles. The guy in our room—senior spring, he already has a job—he’s already at level 52 after only starting this semester. He’s been doing a beefy warrior type,” Wu says. “My other roommate, Jonathan, has been playing a sneaking thief character.”
Macleod adds, “I also think the game does a good job of giving things a sort of epic—and I mean that not so much as ‘Aw, that was epic!’—but I mean in the actual sense of an epic journey.”
As of now, Jayasuriya has put his time with Skyrim on hiatus. “I don’t think I would play it again. Then again, with one character, you can play for like 300-plus hours and still be finding new things.”

"For historical reasons Jews did not build impressive monuments in stone and wood, but concentrated their creative genius on constructing inspiring structures in time."
—Rabbi Ben-Zion Gold, former Director of Harvard Hillel, delivering a sermon in Memorial Church on "Jews, Judaism and the University," Sept. 1975
I. Meeting: Massachusetts Ave., 1944
It begins with a vacant room in a movie theater. Solely five characters.
Hillel at Harvard is initially small, and somewhat divisive; many Jewish students, satisfied with the largely tolerant status quo beyond the final clubs, are wary of an organization that separates them from the rest of their peers.
This separation—not only from the student body, but also from the university itself—differentiates Harvard Hillel from other chapters on American college campuses; Harvard does not allow religious organizations to occupy its buildings.
The issue of a growing Jewish student population, which had dominated campus debates in the era of presidents Eliot and Lowell, has somewhat subsided. Abroad, the war in Europe rages on.
Amid such clashing tides of opinion on religious coexistence, it is a unique time for students at Harvard who identify as Jews. The administration still struggles to define the rightful place of religion on campus.
II. Gathering: 1 & 5 Bryant Street, 1944
Hillel at Harvard is devised as a gathering place, where Jewish students can uphold and reaffirm their heritage. Hillel establishes its first home on Bryant Street, a short walk from the Divinity School. The space is small, and, as the chapter grows and attracts visitors from neighboring college campuses, quickly becomes restrictive.
Undaunted, Hillel continues to expand its programming. As early as 1951, the organization advertises exhibitions of rare Jewish artifacts. The building also hosts meals, religious ceremonies and prayer groups, in addition to sponsoring an ambitious variety of social activities.
Yet Hillel, as both an organization and a place, remains distinct from the university.
III. Dedication: Mt. Auburn Street, off of Holyoke, 1979
"It’s been a long time coming," says Ruben G. Perlmutter ’79, Chairman of Hillel's Coordinating Council, in a 1978 interview with The Crimson. Until now, the center at Bryant Street has been paying the price for its popularity; in a 1977 interview with The Crimson, Henry Morgenthau III, then-president of the Friends of Harvard-Radcliffe Hillel, says the building is "decrepit and overcrowded."
Hillel's ability to secure a new location on Harvard property is a testament to how much the organization has grown during the last decades. From the initial five characters have come crowds of members. A quarter of the student population now identifies as Jewish.
On the occasion of Hillel's move to 74 Mt. Auburn, Dean of the Faculty Henry A. Rosovky remarks on the irony that the group is moving into the original home of the Iroquois Club, one of the rare final clubs that had accepted Jewish students before World War I. Hillel is inheriting, along with a larger and more central location, a building with a storied past. Most recently, it has been home to Sanctuary, which served the homeless community of Cambridge.
The dedication of Hillel's latest facility is a high-profile affair. In true Harvard fashion, the event is marked by speeches by several prominent academic, religious, and administrative personalities. Hundreds then march from the Phillips Brooks House to the newest location, following two marchers carrying Torah scrolls. The primary donors of the Riesman Center—as it will be called—bless the newly renovated rooms.
The sheer size of the ceremony points to larger changes in the structure and focus of Hillel at Harvard; with its new headquarters on Mt. Auburn, and the addition of an open dining hall and café, Hillel seeks to expand its presence on campus beyond its traditional members.
IV. Construction: Mt. Auburn and Plympton Streets, 1993
Moshe Safdie is an Israeli-born architect, recognized around the world for his modern, highly innovative uses of space and light. In 1993, he is commissioned to design a new building for Harvard Hillel, the first to be conceived and built specifically to serve the needs of the organization. After decades of adapting to different locations and sharing spaces, Hillel will finally have a home that is fully adapted to its personal mission.
Strange, how a glass house can signify permanence.
V. Home: Mt. Auburn and Plympton Streets, 2012
Hillel's current facilities, on the corner of Mt. Auburn and Plympton, are very different from the monuments of stone and wood described by Rabbi Ben-Zion Gold. With its large panes of glass, circular courtyard and unique vaulted construction, the center seems to reflect what he termed the "creative genius" of Jewish "structures in time"—that is, the diversity in rituals and practices of Judaism.
Eighteen years since the move into Safdie's light-filled Rosovsky Hall, Hillel has emerged as an organization with a renewed sense of purpose. After decades dedicated to establishing a home for the Jewish community, the organization now appears more focused on its larger mission to serve as "a catalyst for Jewish life" on campus.
However, discussion always returns to the issue of space. Today, Hillel is defined by its location, and the services—kosher dining hall, meeting rooms, courtyard—it offers to the Harvard population at large. Originally an association of students, Harvard Hillel has come to focus on its identity as a place—spiritual, communal, but nonetheless a location—at Harvard.
"The Harvard Hillel is unique because of its special place on campus," says Sara Kantor ’14, President of the Steering Committee of Hillel and a Crimson arts editor. "It serves as a religious center, but not to one specific variety of Judaism."
Now more than ever, Hillel as a location appears intent on opening itself to the greater Harvard community. Current undergraduate leaders at Hillel repeatedly allude to plurality, outreach, and openness. Arun A. Viswanath ’13, former President of the Steering Committee, says, "Everyone involved is working toward making Hillel a place that has something for everyone—especially if you're Jewish, but not necessarily."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The incoming co-presidents of the Harvard Business School Student Association have set an agenda for their upcoming term that focuses on transforming the Business School’s existing social spaces and increasing communication between students and the administration.
Laura J. Merritt and Kunal A. Modi, who were elected co-presidents earlier this month, will begin their term on April 9.
“[Our] platform is really around increasing the heart and vibrancy of campus,” Merritt said. “There’s so much activity that goes on, but we really want to push that activity to the center of campus.”
Modi said that he and Merritt want to “reimagine” campus spaces, including the Spangler Student Center, Spangler Lawn, and the on-campus residential communities, where nearly half of the Business School’s students reside. Their proposals include college football Saturdays at the Spangler Grille and free movie screenings on Spangler Lawn.
“We want to make Spangler Lawn...a public square where people are hanging out, congregating, and giving us the space to build those relationships to get to know each other,” Modi said. “More than anything, HBS is about the people.”
As the Business School experiments with a new curriculum for first-year MBA students, Merritt and Modi said they will communicate student feedback to administrators throughout the academic upheaval.
The hallmark of the new program is a required course called Field Immersion Experiences for Leadership and Development—FIELD, for short—which sends all students to complete a project for a foreign company during January break.
The current Student Association co-presidents, Jonathan R. Dick and Ifunanya “Funa” O. Maduka, will work closely with Merritt and Modi over the next few weeks to provide a smooth transition, Dick said.
“I think Funa and I are very proud of what we’ve been able to achieve in the past year,” Dick said. “On the one hand, you want to do more and keep going with what you’re doing, but it’s been pretty inspiring to see Kunal and Laura come in and the enthusiasm they bring.”
Merritt and Modi are both currently pursuing a Master of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School in addition to an MBA degree from the Business School. They have been close friends throughout their time at Harvard, Modi said.
“We both understood that this is not a president role, it’s a co-president role, and so we felt that the partnership aspect was really important,” Modi said. “We thought that we would bring a lot of complementary skills and personalities to the role.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston lawyer Jim C. King announced on Wednesday afternoon that he would bow out of the contest for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, ending a campaign that struggled from its start to mount any serious challenge to frontrunner Elizabeth Warren.
King’s withdrawal leaves Harvard Law School professor Warren and immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco as the only two remaining Democrats vying to represent their party against Republican incumbent Scott Brown in November. Warren has been considered by most political analysts to be the clear frontrunner in the Democratic race since she entered it last fall.
King’s campaign released a statement yesterday afternoon that said after much thought, King had decided his campaign was no longer benefiting his party or the Massachusetts electorate.
“[T]he review has also made clear that the most effective way to achieve our goals has changed,” King wrote in the statement. “Now, we need to give Elizabeth Warren our support to beat Scott Brown in November.”
In a statement, Warren responded to King’s announcement and ongoing support.
“Jim brought a great deal of integrity and experience to his campaign and I greatly appreciate his support,” she wrote.
King’s candidacy drew very little interest or support from Democratic party leadership or support. His campaign has raised just over $60,000 in 2011. When Warren entered the fray and raked in millions, Democratic political analysts counted King as good as done.
“Only a dog could hear the sound of his campaign,” Democratic consultant Daniel B. Payne wrote in an email.
With the party convention only 10 weeks away, analysts said it was unlikely King could have earned the endorsement of the 15 percent of delegates necessary to make it onto the primary ballot in September.
“Jim King is a great lawyer and a good guy, but he wasn’t going to get on the ballet,” said former Boston City Councillor Lawrence S. DiCara ’71.
A long-time Democrat who often notes his affiliation with the Kennedy family, King said he was always more focused on the party’s success than his own.
“I’m a competitive person. And I think that the Democratic Party in Massachusetts is much better off if we have a competitive primary, and we have much better chance of beating Scott Brown if we have that competitive primary,” King told The Crimson in January. “We need competition, not a coronation.”
Massachusetts Democratic Party Chairman John Walsh echoed this sentiment.
“Jim’s contribution to the debate about replacing Scott Brown is a perfect example of how contested primaries are good for the Massachusetts Democratic Party and good for the Commonwealth,” Walsh said in a statement.
DeFranco—who entered the race in March 2011 and has garnered more support than King—made clear as recently as this week that she will not be forfeiting to Warren any time soon.
Still, analysts said DeFranco will likely have difficult winning support at the convention, since party delegates will want to avoid a contested primary.
“The delegates want to win, they want a clear shot in November, and they don’t want Elizabeth to spend any money or any time on the primary,” DiCara said.

Allston residents criticized Harvard’s “nebulous” development plans for the current Charlesview Apartments site at the Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting on Tuesday evening.
At the meeting, Kevin Casey, associate vice president for Harvard public affairs and communications, said that the University will reserve the site for “institutional use” but would provide no further details.
His lack of specifics drew ire from many residents. Task Force members called for more information on the University’s vision for the six-acre site, which will be vacated once construction on the new Charlesview Complex is finished in 2013.
Harvard acquired the site that currently houses the public housing complex after a 2007 land-swap agreement with the Charlesview’s Board of Directors which consolidated the University’s Allston holdings.
Task Force members said that as the University begins an open planning process for the resumption of its development in Allston, more information on Harvard’s plans for the Charlesview land is crucial to them.
“It’s worrying that we don’t have more information about the Charlesview site when it’s so integral to the plan,” said Task Force Member John A. Bruno. “It’s tough to know how to proceed with such a big unknown.”
Many residents said that they thought the University’s decision to reserve this land undercuts its stated intention to create a thriving commercial district in North Allston.
Task Force member Bruce E. Houghton felt that the proposed Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons—slated to sit on a two-and-a-half acre plot across the street from Charlesview—should incorporate land from the Charlesview site.
“I’m objecting to the fact that you are reserving a large portion of land that could really contribute to the health and viability of the Barry’s Corner project,” said Houghton at the meeting.
Task Force member Harry E. Mattison expressed similar concerns, saying that two-and-a-half acres may not be enough for Harvard to transform Barry’s Corner into a “entertaining and exciting” destination.
“I don’t see how [Harvard’s] vision is going to create that on only 2.5 acres,” Mattison said.  “I think we need that extra room if we really want to make this development a viable plan.”
Several Task Force members have since expressed a desire for an art or cultural complex near the Barry’s Corner and Charlesview area.
“When we’re talking about what brings people to an area or what are the things the neighborhood wants, I think that an art and cultural center could be very important,” said Task Force member Millie H. McLaughlin.
Prior to halting construction in Allston in 2009, the creation of an art and cultural complex was one of the oft-repeated proposals for the Charlesview land. However, the University did not make any official plans for the development of the site.
Casey defended the University’s decision to reserve the Charlesview land in an email on Wednesday.
“The proposed institutional uses can be consistent with goals of activation for Barry’s Corner,” Casey wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Wow, the Pulitzer Prize—this award is much heavier than it looks,” joked Jonathan D. Adler ’12 during a reading of “The Hunger Pains,” the Harvard Lampoon’s parody of Suzanne Collin’s popular novel “The Hunger Games,” at the Harvard Coop Bookstore on Tuesday.
While the Lampoon did not in fact win a Pulitzer, the parody written by the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine has been on the New York Times’ bestseller list for three weeks since its publication on Feb. 7.
The book focuses on Kantkiss Neverclean, a sixteen-year-old who takes her sister’s place as a contestant on the Hunger Games, Peaceland’s second highest-rated reality television show. In the excerpt read by Poonster Noah J. Madoff ’12, Neverclean struggles to make sense of the brutality of football, ominous trombone noises, and serenades from a smooth jazz DJ, while simultaneously trying to stay alive and locate her friend Pita.
Lampoon President Owen T. L. Bates ’13 said that the writing process was collaborative.
“We kinda grabbed pieces of paper out of a hat,” he said. “Most of the chapters were written by single members of staff, a few were co-written, and then they were all given to the editors and they completely rewrote everything.”
Other Lampoon writers added that Mad Libs, random word generators, and Siri, the iPhone 4S’s personal assistant, were helpful in times of creative voids.
The Poonsters also treated their audience to a piece titled “The Time Guy” from one of the humor magazine’s most distinguished former members, Conan C. O’Brien ’85.
While fans of “The Hunger Games” might have been quick to follow the “tribute” and “district” references in the parody, others left the reading feeling bewildered.
“I think it was too modern to me,” said attendee Nancy R. Sizer. “I really don’t relate that much with the story, but it was fun to learn about.”

UPDATED: March 22, 2012, at 7:53 p.m.
For the past few days, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Byron A. Leftwich has been running around—not on his familiar territory on a football field, but on the campus of Harvard Business School.
Leftwich is one of more than 30 professional football players enrolled in the National Football League Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program at the Business School. During the five-day program, the NFL players receive instruction from Business School faculty about topics ranging from finance to managing a personal brand.
“I’m at the point in my career where you can start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel,” Leftwich said. “It makes you ask yourself the question, ‘What am I going to do when I’m done?’”
Leftwich has played in the NFL since 2003, in a career that has included a Super Bowl win for the 2008 season. But like many professional athletes, Leftwich is now looking to broaden his skill set for his post-NFL career.
“I think this was a perfect opportunity for me to stick one leg through the door and just try to learn as much as I can,” Leftwich said.
The certificate program was introduced at Harvard in 2005, and the Business School has since hosted the initiative every year, except during the five-month NFL lockout in 2011.
“There are a lot of issues that players hit when they stop playing,” said Michael J. Roberts ’79, one of the instructors for the program. The program was created with help from the NFL and the NFL Players Association, he said, in order to “help them think about the next chapter after their playing careers.”
Leftwich said, “I think we can get into trouble as athletes sometimes, believing we know something that we really don’t know.”
He added, “Coming into it with the right mindset—‘hey, I know nothing’—that’s going to allow me to learn as much as I can from this program.”
Leftwich said that he hopes to don a business suit after he hangs up his uniform. “Hopefully, this [program] is the jumpstart of me becoming a businessman,” he said. “I’m in no rush to get there; I still want to play some football. But at the same time, I think this is a perfect place to learn what you need to learn for the business aspect.”
Leftwich, who played football for Marshall University, said this week has been “completely different” from his college experience. In particular, he said he enjoyed the Business School’s case study method. As he described it, “There are no right or wrong answers.”
Other students enrolled in this year’s program include Patriots safety Joshua R. Barrett, Colts fullback Chris Gronkowski, and Broncos guard Russ Hochstein, according to the New England Sports Network. The program is a joint effort with the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

This article has been revised to reflect the following corrections:
CORRECTION: March 22
An earlier version of this article stated that Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania and Stanford Graduate School of Business participate in the National Football League Business Management and Entrepreneurial Program along with Harvard Business School and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. In fact, Penn and Stanford are no longer involved in the program. In addition, due to an editing error, the headline of the article read "NFL Touches Down in Cambridge." Harvard Business School is located in Boston, not Cambridge.

The New York Knicks defeated the Philadelphia 76ers on Wednesday night at the Wells Fargo Center, stretching their winning streak to five games.
The Knicks have remained undefeated since head coach Mike D’Antoni’s decision to step down last week. After losing their last matchup against the Sixers, 106-94, in New York, the Knicks bounced back to defeat the top team in the Atlantic division.
Jeremy Lin ’10 had a solid game for the Knicks, especially heating up in the final minutes of the contest.  He recorded 18 points and three assists in nearly 36 minutes on the court, scoring 16 of his 18 points in the fourth quarter.
Amar’e Stoudemire led the Knicks in scoring with 21 points and nine rebounds.  Carmelo Anthony was good for ten points and five boards.  In addition, veteran Baron Davis returned to the Knicks’ lineup after suffering from a strained hamstring that required him to miss two games.
The Knicks look to keep the magic, and their winning streak, alive as they take on the Raptors on Friday night in Toronto.

The struggles continue for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team. 
Hosting No. 14/20 Boston College at Harvard Stadium on Wednesday night, the Crimson dropped its third straight game, falling to the Eagles, 7-5.
After taking an early 5-1 lead, Boston College withstood a late Harvard comeback attempt to snap a two-game losing streak of its own.
Despite holding the Eagles (5-4, 1-1 ACC) to a season-low seven goals, the Crimson (2-4, 0-2 Ivy) was unable to figure out the Boston College defense. Harvard, which entered the contest averaging 9.2 goals per game, was held to just two goals over the first 50 minutes of play, eventually finishing with five—its lowest offensive output since April 2009.
"We’re not executing," sophomore attack Chelsey Newman said. "We just need to work on limiting turnovers."
The Crimson coughed up the ball 10 times during the game and connected on just five of 18 shot attempts.
Junior midfielder Nina Kucharczyk paced the Crimson offense with two goals on four shots. After going scoreless in Harvard’s first four games, Kucharczyk has been on a tear as of late, posting a pair of scores in the Crimson’s past two contests.
"She’s a little bit more comfortable with the position that she’s playing in," Harvard coach Lisa Miller said. "She’s an athletic kid, and she’s tough to manage."
Kucharczyk’s second score of the night brought the Crimson within two, 7-5, with 5:47 to play.
Sophomore Kasey Uhlenhuth captured the ensuing draw control to give Harvard possession of the ball with a chance to pull within a single goal.
Boston College’s stingy defense kept the Crimson away from the net for nearly two minutes. With just over three minutes to go, junior midfielder Danielle Tetreault got past her defender and penetrated to the net. But Tetreault’s shot attempt was swallowed up by Eagles goalie Emily Mata, who finished with eight saves on the evening.
The Crimson had one last chance after junior Jennifer VanderMeulen caused a turnover with 1:50 to go, but co-captain Melanie Baskind’s attempt with 68 seconds left on the clock was stopped by Mata.
The Eagles took possession of the ball and ran out the clock to secure the two-goal win. Boston College, which was led offensively by Brittany Wilton (two goals), Moira Barry (one goal, one assist), and Brooke Blue (one goal, one assist), got off to a quick start, posting three goals in the first five minutes of play.
"We got off to a slow start," Miller said. "I think [Boston College] played a little bit faster than the last couple of opponents that we’ve played."
Wilton took the game’s opening draw control, and less than three minutes later Kristin Igoe put the Eagles on the board.
Boston College did not waste much time tacking on its second score. After Katherine Caufield won the ensuing draw control, the Eagles got the ball to Sam Taylor who finished her lone score of the game 10 seconds later.
Tetreault responded with her 10th goal of the season on the Crimson’s next possession, but Boston College went back up by two with 25:18 to go thanks to a Cali Ceglarski finish.
Barry and Brooke tacked on goals of their own to give the Eagles a commanding 5-1 lead before 15 minutes had ticked off the clock.
"We don’t always play at pace," Miller said. "We kind of wait for other team to speed us up instead of setting the tempo on our own."
After being held scoreless for more than 15 minutes of play, the Crimson received its second score of the night after Kucharczykbounced a shot past Mata with 9:53 to play.
Rookie goalkeeper Kelly Weiss kept Harvard within three with a pair of saves before the buzzer brought an end to the first period.
Weiss held the Eagles scoreless for the first 19 minutes of the second frame, but the Crimson offense failed to capitalize. After Harvard missed its first four shot attempts of the half, Wilton put the Eagles up, 7-2, with 10:44 to play, off back-to-back goals in a span of 46 seconds.
Harvard got scores from VanderMeulen, Baskind, and Kucharczyk in the final 10 minutes of play, but it was too little too late, and the Eagles emerged with just their seventh win over the Crimson in 34 meetings.
The loss marks Harvard’s third straight to a ranked opponent. The Crimson will get its next chance at taking down a ranked foe on March 31 when it hosts No. 2 Syracuse at Gillette Stadium.
"We play probably one of the toughest schedules in the country," Miller said. "There’s no time for let downs or feeling sorry for yourself."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A calm settled over the Murr Center tennis courts as freshman Henry Steer prepared for his final serve of the evening.
Steer bounced the ball twice, stopped, and then took three more bounces before delivering a powerful serve. After a short volley, Steer’s opponent ended the game, set, and match by hitting the ball into the net.
This final game, a come-from-behind victory, epitomized the evening for the No. 16 Harvard men’s tennis team (14-1), which at one point in the night found itself down in four out of six singles matches against Boston College (4-8, 0-5 ACC).
But the deficit was not long-lasting. The Crimson quickly came back and defeated its opponent, 6-1, Wednesday night.
After losing his first set, 7-5, Steer dominated the second and third sets, winning 6-3 and 6-2, respectively.
The victory secured a 6-1 win over the crosstown rival Eagles. And although Harvard has not lost a match since Feb. 4, its tenth victory in a row did not come easily.
The Wednesday night matchup began with doubles play. Freshman Alex Steinroeder and senior Jonathan Pearlman set the tone early, dominating their opponents, 8-1.
This was not the case, though, for sophomore Casey MacMaster and senior Alistair Felton as the pair dropped its match, 8-5.
As each team had won one doubles match, the Crimson needed to win the third to secure the doubles point. This burden fell to junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen.
In the early goings of the match, it appeared that the Harvard players could not handle the pressure. The twosome fell behind, 3-2, and Boston College gained momentum.
Fueled by their teammates’ encouraging cries, Nguyen and Nguyen mounted a rally to take the next game, eventually closing out a defeat of their opponents, 8-6.
The Crimson went into singles play with the early 1-0 lead, but the Eagles nearly erased the deficit.
Pearlman—who played at the No. 1 spot for Harvard—and his opponent traded the lead for much of the first set, tying the games total at three and four apiece.
The battle would continue for two more games until Pearlman lost, 6-4. The senior went on to drop the next set, 6-1.
After five games in the first set, Denis Nguyen found himself in the same position he been in during his doubles match.
The freshman fell behind, 2-3, but rallied to take the next game. His opponent recaptured the lead, 4-3.
But Nguyen remained calm and used a strong forehand to tie the frame. He never looked back, winning the set, 6-4, and, shortly after, taking the next set by the same score.
Fellow rookie Shaun Chaudhuri, fell into an even deeper hole during his match. Chauduri, who is undefeated (15-0) in singles play this year, dropped four of his first six games.
"I knew I was down early, but I didn’t panic," Chaudhuri said. "I kept playing strong and aggressive and hoped that things would fall my way."
True to his word, the freshman rallied from 4-2 down to take the first game, 6-4. His strong play carried into the next frame, which he won handily, 6-2.
Meanwhile, Steinroeder’s match followed the same pattern. The freshman lost his initial set, 6-4, but stormed back to take the next two sets, 6-1 and 6-0, respectively.
"I look around at the scores during my matches, and I saw that we were down in most of them," Steinroeder said. "It was a little scary, but then we started to pull it together and play strong."
Unlike the rest of his teammates, Andy Nguyen did not fall behind in his match. He won both his first and second set handily, each by a margin of 6-2.
Despite his team’s slow start, Steinroeder noted his belief that Wednesday night’s match can help the Crimson as it climbs up in the national rankings.
"We started out slowly today, and I think that was because we were riding a high from spring break," Streinroder said. "This was also the first match on a school night. That being said, I think that tonight says a lot about our team. It shows that we are able to settle down and rally if we fall behind early."

In its third conference game of the season Wednesday night, the Harvard women’s water polo team (10-9, 2-1 CWPA) defeated Brown, 7-5, in front of a raucous home crowd at Blodgett Pool.
The Crimson victory over the Bears marks its fifth win over its Ivy League rival out of six total meetings over the past three seasons.
The Bears (11-7, 3-2 CWPA) were coming off a four-game winning streak at the Marist Invite, highlighted by a 7-5 victory against No. 10 Michigan.
Harvard also faced tough competition during its spring break trip to California last week.
Although the team did not claim any victories over its recent ranked opponents, the Crimson lost to No. 14 UC Santa Barbara by one goal and to Cal Baptist by a narrow margin of two.
According to Harvard coach Ted Minnis, both teams’ recent successes against big-name squads set the stage for an important matchup against the Bears last night.
"We can play with these teams," Minnis said. "Brown beat Michigan a couple weeks ago—they got three votes in the top 20 this week. For us to come in to have confidence…that we got in California is huge for us."
Harvard’s win over Brown puts the team back over a .500 record and in position to qualify for the upcoming CWPA Southern Division Championship and the CWPA Eastern Championship.
The crowd at Blodgett Pool was active, and active early, creating a playoff-like atmosphere as the Crimson and Brown traded blows.
Numerous Harvard supporters donned body paint as chants of Crimson support echoed throughout the building.
"It is huge to have fans at the game and it just means the world to us," co-captain Devan Kennifer said. "It pumps us all up…especially having such a loud and energetic crowd."
Harvard struck the first blow of the game, when senior attacker Monica Zdrojewski netted a goal three minutes into the first period.
But points were hard to come by as flurries of shots from both teams hit posts or were deflected by the outspread arms of defenders.
"We weren’t patient enough on our offense," Kennifer said. "We had a lot of turnovers, we were a little bit sloppy with our passing, [and] we didn’t protect the ball. But we stayed calm and powered through."
Sophomore attacker Shayna Prince capped off the period with a score with 1:30 remaining in the first frame to put Harvard up 2-0.
The Crimson held the Bears scoreless through the first period with a stingy defensive effort from freshman goalkeeper Arial Dukes.
In the second period, Brown ramped up its defensive effort, forcing several Harvard turnovers to hold the Crimson scoreless for six minutes and tie up the score, 2-2.
Harvard responded with two goals of its own to end the second period and headed into halftime with a 4-2 advantage.
On offense, both teams struggled early in the third frame with their set offensive formations, appearing stagnant and unable to penetrate.
"When we moved, we looked good, and we got scoring opportunities," Minnis said. "When we sat and played into their soft press, I think that played to their advantage.
"They shot block very well," he added. "They want you to shoot from outside. That movement was key for us."
On several instances, both teams were able to get the ball out ahead of the defense on counter-attack plays but either turned the ball over or botched attempts to score.
At end the third period, Kennifer looked to shoot on an uncontested drive toward the mouth of the goal but fumbled with the ball.
Fortunately for Harvard, she was able to tip it toward junior two-meter defender Elyse Molnar who scored to put Harvard up, 5-3. 
With 4:29 remaining in the fourth period, Kennifer was able to capitalize to put the Crimson up 6-3.
Less than a minute later, Zdrojewski helped to pad the Harvard lead with a goal of her own, putting the Crimson up, 7-3.
The Bears attempted to spark a late comeback with a goal with 2:42 remaining in the final period to put Brown up, 7-4.
As the time began to run out, the Bears started to speed up their possessions and look for opportunities to score quickly.
Harvard was able to stymie the Brown comeback attempt and put the Bears away for good after a last-second Brown shot with 38 seconds remaining in the game.
Shayna Price paced the Crimson with two goals, three assists, and five steals.
Dukes anchored Harvard’s defensive effort with 13 saves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping three of its first five games, the Harvard softball team clicked during its spring break trip, winning eight of nine matchups.
But the Crimson (10-4) will have to wait a few more days to continue that run, as a double-header scheduled for Thursday against Quinnipiac was postponed indefinitely. The contest would have been Harvard’s first of the year at Soldiers Field.
Thanks to the prospect of rough weather conditions over the weekend, the Bobcats were forced to adjust their conference schedule. Now, Quinnipiac will face Mount St. Mary’s on Friday, a day earlier than previously planned, which precluded the team from traveling to Cambridge for the two-game set against the Crimson.
The postponement moves Harvard’s home opener back to March 27, when the squad will take on Bryant at 4 p.m. But first, the Crimson will travel to Bethlehem, Penn., this weekend for four games at the Lehigh Tournament.
After taking the Ivy League title in dominant fashion a year ago, Harvard has looked sharp in its opening 14 contests. Three starters boast batting averages above .400, including sophomore third baseman Kasey Lange. The defending Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Lange has all three Crimson home runs in addition to tallying a team-best 12 RBIs. Her .711 slugging percentage paces Harvard as well.
In the circle, senior ace Rachel Brown has picked hitters apart in the early goings. Averaging 8.45 strikeouts per game, Brown has a miniscule 0.64 ERA to go along with a 6-1 record and seven complete games. Overall, Harvard has a 1.67 team ERA, tops in the Ivy League by 0.79.
The team begins its quest to recapture the Ancient Eight crown on March 30, when it opens Ivy League play against Cornell in a double-header in Ithaca, N.Y.

The quick and dirty about what's been going on around the Ancient  Eight (and other schools too).
Dartmouth seems to have found itself in the midst of what IvyGate has described as an "epic hazing scandal." While "epic" brings to mind greatness and heroism, in this case, there seems to be something rotten in the state of New Hampshire. Earlier this month, 27 (!) members of Dartmouth's Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity were charged with hazing violations that occurred during the 2009 and 2011 fall pledge season. Apparently SAE pledges were forced to "swim in a kiddie pool of rotten food, vomit and other bodily fluids; eat omelets made of vomit; and chug cups of vinegar." That's disgusting.
Meanwhile, Princeton's new dean of the college, Valerie Smith, just announced that she "does not have plans" to do away with the school's grade deflation policy. To those who think grade deflation at Princeton is actually unreasonable, the following should help clarify. The school's policy states "no more than 35 percent of students on average should earn an A in a course and no more than 55 percent of students on average should earn an A on independent work." Rough stuff.
Over in New Haven, an article published in the Yale Daily News gives male students advice on how to be a (Yale) gentleman. Tips include wearing trousers (not pants), reading "The Economist" (conspicuously, of course), and skiing in the Alps (only the Alps). It also suggests smoking Cuban cigars (while reminding friends that "each puff is worth more than their life"); and owning a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel named Isabel. Satire? Or a strikingly too real account of good old Yalie boys?
And in other news, The Daily Pennsylvanian just announced that Geoffrey Canada, social activist and founder of the Harlem Children's Zone, will be Penn's commencement speaker this year. Maybe he plans on expanding his work to West Philly next? All jokes aside, kudos to Penn for choosing an interesting and inspiring speaker.

We may be well into 2012, but Harvard's 375th Anniversary celebration is far from over. As part of the festivities, Harvard has announced the John Harvard Book Celebration, a series of lectures at Cambridge and Boston Public Libraries that are free and open to the public. The series formally began in January, but there's still plenty of time to catch some of the most exciting speakers between now and May, including Drew Faust and Steven Pinker. Finally, in honor of the 400 books famously donated by John Harvard to the nascent University's libraries in 1638, Harvard itself will donate—you guessed it—400 books to Boston and Cambridge libraries, which, in case you were curious, constitutes approximately .0000002 percent of Harvard's own 16.6 million-volume collection.
