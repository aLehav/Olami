After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, my mom called me to tell me she missed me.
As college students, we’ve all flown the nest and some, like me, are thousands of miles away from home. We should be used to the vast distance that separates us from our families. It shouldn’t have been heartbreaking to hear her voice. It shouldn’t have hurt me.
But it did.
It did because I’ve been away for so long. I left California on my own when I was 15 to attend boarding school on the East Coast—a side of the country that none of my family had ever seen before. Like my immigrant parents, I left in search of opportunity. My mom used to tell me, “Nothing good can come from staying at home.” She told me to leave even though it pained her to see me go so early. Bettering my circumstances meant leaving the life I knew.
For people like me, this is what “making it” means. It means constantly leaving because your home can’t provide for you. It means explaining to your mom you won’t be able to see her this summer because you’re going abroad. It means hopping on six hour plane flights, missing funerals and birthdays, and explaining that plane tickets are just too expensive to come home for the holidays this time. It means distance.
Like many other first generation college students, I lead a double life—though not in the CIA, secret agent kind of way. My double life stems from the two irreconcilable facets of my identity that seem to be growing farther apart as I get older.
There’s school life, where I pass by grand, brick buildings on my way to class and eat my meals under chandeliers. I’m surrounded by students stressing over midterms, internship resumes, and research essays. Hard work at Harvard is marked by numbers and papers: grades, awards, and titles.
Then there’s home life, where oil extractors bob up and down in the washed out landscape throughout the day and night. We worry about paying the bills. Hard work here is the hardened callouses on my dad’s hands and the deep tan of his leathery, cut up skin.
The vast difference between home and school life meant that the transition to boarding school and later to Harvard was a culture shock. It took years to adjust. While I knew my family would support me if they knew how to do so, there were still many times I nearly quit, thinking I wasn’t cut out for this life.
After many years, I’ve now learned (for the most part) how to assimilate into these elite environments. When I’m not around my Korean friends, I can slip into the American accent I’ve mastered, rejecting the thick Korean one that narrated my childhood. I can dress the part and understand the unspoken language that dominates the way this campus operates. I’ve learned to take on the airs of an identity that is so far from the one my parents have gifted me. My parents used to think that the life I live now was reserved for baegin (white), buja (wealthier) Americans. But now it’s my life. I’ve “made it.”
That’s when I noticed that the distance between me and my home has become so much more than physical. Assimilation has meant losing who I used to be. Ironically, as I find myself constantly entering these foreign, elite territories, I’ve become the foreigner at home. One alum described Harvard as a “catapult that shoots people from lower classes into the upper one, leaving them in an unfamiliar (and perhaps unwanted) new territory and robbing their communities of value.” At Harvard, we’re supposed to celebrate diversity, but these institutions mold and prime us for a very particular type of lifestyle and career—one that does not involve the classes of people I know back home.
To some extent, we all change and move on with our lives. But assimilation and leaving home is a survival mechanism for students like me. Students who don’t have this double life don’t have to choose between their conflicting identities because they don’t ever have to code-switch or put on a different persona when they’re at school. Entering Harvard meant jumping into a foreign world for me. For others, it was merely a continuation. I might still go abroad during my summers even though I miss home, but I do so because I don’t know when an opportunity like this will ever come again. I’m worried that if I say no, I’ve missed my chance for good. This is more than just an irrational anxiety; students like me have never travelled in their lives without the aid of places like Harvard.
I used to describe the relationship I had with my home as a stretching rubber band. I’m on one end, my home on the other. As I move farther and farther away from home, I can feel the tension more and more, as it gets harder and harder to keep moving away. I had thought that experiencing this tension meant the connection between us was only getting stronger. I thought that at a certain point, I’d release this tension and send myself hurdling back to where I came from. I never thought it was possible that there’d be a point where the rubber would snap, sending me flying farther from home than I’d ever imagined.
In Harvard’s circles, we frequently talk about “advancing” ourselves, “getting ahead,” and “climbing the ladder,” all terms that imply our distance from where we came from. As I learn to better adapt and thrive in the world that I now live in, I wonder if I’ll ever be able to return and reclaim my old self. I wonder if I will still be able to take the time to look back. I wonder if I’ll be home again soon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The all-female Bee Club and all-male Delphic Club will share membership and a clubhouse starting in September, marking the first union of male and female final clubs since the College began targeting single-gender groups at Harvard in 2016.
In a joint statement issued Tuesday night, Bee undergraduate president Alexa J. Boghosian ’18 and Delphic undergraduate president Dan Roman ’18 said that the groups have granted each other’s members “reciprocal membership rights.” They will share the clubhouse historically owned by the Delphic on 9 Linden St.
Undergraduate members of both clubs held a vote on the matter in August, and Bee and Delphic undergraduates voted in favor of the move, according to Boghosian and Roman. The two club presidents added that the graduate members of both clubs “fully supported” the idea.
“We are thrilled that we will be sharing the same club house and club operations starting in September,” Boghosian and Roman said. “The Delphic and the Bee look forward to opening this new chapter in our histories and pursuing a gender-inclusive future together.”
The two clubs’ decision comes the same month that the College’s historic policy penalizing members of single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations, announced in May 2016, goes into effect for the Class of 2021. Under the policy, undergraduate members of Harvard’s single-gender social groups—starting with the current freshman class—are barred from campus leadership positions, athletic team captaincies, and certain prestigious fellowships.
The policy may change, however. A committee charged with reviewing the College’s social group penalties recommended this summer that Harvard repeal the current policy and instead implement a total ban on campus social groups, whether single-gender or co-ed. University President Drew G. Faust is set to make a final decision regarding the social group penalties later this semester.
Roman and Boghosian did not comment on whether the College’s social group penalties influenced  the move to share membership and a clubhouse.
In the year since the policy’s debut, four of Harvard’s 23 traditionally single-gender groups affected by the policy have adopted gender neutral membership practices: final clubs the Seneca, the Oak, and the Sab, as well as fraternity Alpha Epsilon Pi.
The Delphic has considered merging with a female club since at least May 2016, when club graduate president John R. S. Jacobsson ’90 and vice president David S. DeSimone ’98 wrote a letter to alumni informing them the Delphic had already held “introductory meetings” with the Bee, IC, and La Vie clubs.
Over the summer, the courtship between the Bee and the Delphic continued—at one point, over drinks in New York City. On Thursday, July 13, the Bee and the Delphic held a joint summer cocktail party for both graduate and undergraduate members, according to a copy of the invitation obtained by The Crimson.
The attire was “jacket and tie.” Undergraduates attended free, while graduates of less than five years were asked to pay $50 and graduates of five years or more were asked to pay $75.
In an email sent to members announcing the party on July, Delphic graduate Christopher L. Mann ’85 boasted about the history and membership of the Bee.
“The Bee Club is the oldest and most established female final club in Cambridge,” Mann wrote in the email, obtained by The Crimson. “They have roughly 400 graduate members, compared to our roughly 1200 members.”
He added that “this should prove to be a very interesting event.”

Winthrop House opened its doors Saturday following a year-long renovation that included the addition of a new hall to the upperclassman residence and the expansion of common spaces.
The modernization of Winthrop's two original halls and addition of a new wing named Beren Hall to the western halls came in under budget and ahead of schedule, according to Stephanie R. Robinson, Winthrop’s Faculty Dean. The project added several new facilities to the House and will allow all of Winthrop’s residents to live in the House for the first time in recent memory.
Robinson’s husband and co-Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. praised the renewed House, which was built in 1914 to house freshmen.
“Move-in was wonderful, there was a lot of excitement. Jaws dropped at the renovations,” Sullivan said. “They really brought it back to the original glory.”
Beren Hall, the new five-story addition to the House named for donor Robert M. Beren ’47, eliminated the need for overflow housing in the DeWolfe apartments and features new common spaces that include a rooftop terrace and a student lounge.
“The room that excites almost everyone is our rooftop terrace,” Robinson said. “It has beautiful views of Boston, Allston, the campus. It’s just spectacular.”
For the past year, Winthrop residents lived at the former Inn at Harvard—dubbed the “Winn” during Winthrop’s yearlong stay—and in a mix of apartments sprinkled throughout Harvard Square while construction was underway.
Returning to Winthrop House’s Mill Street complex, students like Michael Shao '19 look forward to utilizing the House’s new amenities, which also include a two-story grille, a meditation room, and an art studio.
“I think the biggest upgrade is just the amount of new amenities that we have that really add a lot to the experience of House life and promote community,” Shao said.
Simone R. Braunstein ’20 echoed Shao’s sentiment, but criticized the lack of in-suite common spaces for blocking groups.
“The fact that the Houses are transitioning away from common space within rooms towards group common space seems well-intentioned, but then everyone is left in hallway singles rather than having shared common space with their blockmates,” Braunstein said.
Concerns about changes to the composition of hall common rooms are not new to College administrators: Dunster residents lodged similar criticisms when their House reopened in August 2015.
The House also includes furniture designed with Winthrop’s colors in mind, as well as murals with photos of current and past Winthrop students.
“The new furniture is a good mix between modern and still keeping the history behind Winthrop like the new wood dining hall and library chairs and tables with the Winthrop insignia on it,” Shao added.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ more than $1 billion House Renewal project has met significant challenges as a result of dwindling financial reserves and tepid donor support.
Across the street from Winthrop, construction on the College’s third undergraduate House to be renovated is underway. Unlike previous renovations, Lowell House’s will require two years to complete. The Lowell project is expected to be completed by August 2019.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust defended race-conscious admissions practices in front of what she said is the most diverse class of freshmen in Harvard’s history at the College’s convocation on Tuesday.
The annual ceremony, which welcomes incoming freshmen to campus, began with the usual fanfare: bright-eyed freshmen parading around the Yard to the marching band’s tune.
But it soon took a serious turn, as Faust and other administrators spoke of the need to stand up for the University’s commitment to diversity in the face of mounting threats.
An anti-affirmative action group is suing Harvard, arguing that its admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants. Just last month, the Justice Department announced it would investigate a complaint by a coalition of Asian-American associations that makes similar claims about racial discrimination.
“We will continue to fervently defend our admissions processes, and the importance of diversity as essential to our educational philosophy,” Faust told freshmen.
Faust also used convocation as an opportunity to condemn final clubs, to loud applause, calling them “discriminatory, exclusionary, overwhelmingly homogeneous organizations” that are “antithetical to our values and educational goals.”
Faust, who will step down from the presidency in June 2018, defended the University’s efforts to crack down on the clubs under her purview—arguing that a policy sanctioning members of the class of 2021 who join single-gender social organizations advances Harvard’s commitment to diversity.
“This new policy is motivated by the same commitment to providing an educational experience that affirms the importance of every student at Harvard, and urges students to learn from classmates unlike themselves,” she said.
A faculty committee recommended a more far-reaching policy in July, and Faust will have to approve any revisions to the current policy before they can take effect.
In her speech Tuesday, Faust also alluded to divisions that have plagued the country since the election of President Donald Trump last November.
“You are coming to Harvard at a critical time, for our country and for our University,” she told freshmen. “In the face of proliferating incidents of hatred and violence across the country, we need to insist on a different way of being together. Let us strive to be a model of unity at a time of fracture and divisiveness.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also referenced the tumultuous political climate in his address. He spoke of protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, where white supremacists violently clashed with counter-protesters earlier this month, adding that a recent hurricane in Texas has also sparked national anxiety.
“The plight of those in the Houston area, divisions in the country, divisions in the world, the re-emergence of dark, nihilistic ideologies of racial and ethnic superiority, challenges to the planet give what you are going to do here with your lives a sense of urgency,” he said. “We have never needed your talents, your energy, your commitment more than we do right now.”
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith also addressed students. Marcus K. Granderson ’18 delivered the student salutation, advising freshmen to chart their own paths and keep in mind that “you will always be enough.”
The Harvard Glee Club, the Radcliffe Choral Society, the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, and the Kuumba Singers of Harvard College performed during the ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Charles A. Murray ’65, a political scientist whose appearance at Middlebury College earlier this year prompted violent protest, will speak at Harvard next week at an event hosted by an undergraduate group that seeks to test the College's commitment to free speech.
In his scholarship, Murray has argued that some racial groups have higher IQ levels than others, drawing widespread criticism from scholars and watchdog groups who have labeled him a “white supremacist” and “eugenicist.”
At Harvard, Murray will discuss his 2015 book “By the People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission” with the Open Campus Initiative, a student organization launched last year  to “test” the commitment to free speech at elite universities like Harvard by inviting controversial speakers to campus. Jordan Peterson—a University of Toronto professor who believes gender nonconformity threatens free speech—spoke at a panel hosted by the group in the spring, prompting protests from Harvard students who dismissed Peterson’s beliefs as discriminatory.
Murray’s arrival on campus, just weeks after white supremacist groups rallied in Charlottesville in demonstrations that prompted violence and killed one woman, has raised concerns among students.
“It took me aback that he’s coming, I thought ‘this is a lot,’” Ngozi Musa ’19 said.
But Musa said she has since opened up to the event. She said she realized that “unless we sit down and have a conversation with people that are labeled white supremacist, we’re never going to get anywhere.”
Murray, who studied history while an undergraduate at the College, has largely dismissed criticisms of his work, shrugging off the arguments as confusion over the content of “The Bell Curve.” After the Middlebury incident, he wrote online that “he’s never argued” that white men are superior to disadvantaged groups.
Caden W. Petersmeyer ’19, the treasurer of the Open Campus Initiative, said the group believes the Murray event is an opportunity to contrast the state of free speech at Harvard with that at Middlebury and other peer institutions.
“It would be a great opportunity to demonstrate our community's  commitment to open discourse,” Petersmeyer said, adding that he doesn’t expect to see the same violence at Harvard.
The September event will be restricted to Harvard ID holders.  Alexander R. Miller, the assistant dean of student life, said his office will work with students to “ensure their events are safe and successful.” Harvard reserves the right to cancel an event if it “pose[s] a risk to the safety or learning environment” of the school, according to its policies on free speech.
In an email, Murray indicated he’s not concerned about safety at the event.
“Safety is not a concern,” he wrote. “After Middlebury, the problem has been security so tight that students have had a hard time attending. I’m hoping Harvard figures out a happy medium.”
Petersmeyer said the organization’s mission is “not to inspire controversy.”
“I’d say that there’s a trap to fall into here. We’re about free speech, but we’re not necessarily trying to promote one viewpoint,” he said. “The whole point is not to provide balance, but to provide opinions that are outside of the mainstream of Harvard.”
The next event hosted by the group will be a debate featuring two conservative speakers and two liberal panelists.
“It’s not like we’re going to become best friends with white supremacists, but at the same time it’s necessary we have those conversations,” Musa said. “Of course, I don’t agree with Charles Murray’s perspective, but if I’m able to challenge it intelligently, maybe he’ll have a change of mind.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Louie’s Superette, a convenience store that often sells beer and wine to Harvard students, may soon be leaving Harvard’s campus after owner Cheng-San Chen announced he will sell the property.
Chen, who has taught computer modelling and simulation at St. John’s University, worked as a data analyst for Xerox, and run Louie’s on-and-off for three decades, said he decided to put the store on the market ahead of his retirement.
An online listing advertising the sale reads, “Great upside potential by increasing store hours, open Sundays, and open regular hours.” Currently, Chen said Louie’s opening hours are irregular—usually from late afternoon to midnight each day—and depend on variables like student schedules and the weather.
The business is listed for $250,000 and the property for $1.2 million.
Since its opening, Louie’s has been a popular destination for students to purchase beer, wine, and food. Chen said he estimates that half of his customers buy alcoholic beverages.
He added that he will miss the eclectic array of customers coming in and out of the yellow-paneled corner store.
Rattling off a list of famous politicians, successful business executives, and students hailing from different countries, Chen said he has appreciated chatting with visitors. Above the refrigerator doors is his international currency collection, with bills gifted from his customers.
“I know so many people that have good stories. Maybe I can write a book. The name of the book is ‘A Little Store around the Charles,” Chen said.
In retirement, Chen said he plans to babysit his two grandsons and split time between the United States and Taiwan, where he's from.
He added that he does not plan to return to the counter anytime soon.
“I always like to do something new and challenging,” Chen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Confusion about the College’s various efforts to curb the influence of single-gender social groups on campus has snarled this month’s roll-out of the College’s historic penalties on members of those organizations.
In May 2016, the College unveiled penalties for members of single-gender social groups, barring them from campus leadership positions, athletic captaincies, and certain post-graduate fellowships. Those sanctions have taken effect and apply to the Class of 2021, which arrived on campus earlier this month.
Since then, administrators and faculty have tried to revise the sanctions at least twice: First by strengthening the policy, and then by recommending it be repealed and replaced by a complete ban on Harvard social groups.
These proposed revisions have left some newly-arrived students ignorant of the rules that apply to them and forced administrators to play catch-up as they develop and discard mechanisms to enforce an ever-shifting goal.
Employees in the Office of Student Life developed an online affirmation that required undergraduates to certify they were not members of single-gender social groups before registering as leaders of student organizations.
Titled “Single-Gender Social Organization Certification” and labeled “REQUIRED,” the document asked students to check a box certifying they “understand the contents of this policy” and are not “member[s] of a single-gender social organization,” according to a copy of the affirmation obtained by The Crimson.
But Office of Student Life staffers later canceled the digital affirmation after learning the penalties might be revised, according to Assistant Dean of Student Life Alex R. Miller.
“As part of its internal administrative processes, the College developed a draft certification form,” Miller wrote in an emailed statement. “The draft form… was initially proposed in 2016 for consideration, but never implemented.”
Instead, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana attempted to ensure new students understood the policy and its consequences via his welcome email, sent to freshmen on August 16. In the email, Khurana explained the social group penalties and invited students to contact the Office of Student Life if they had additional questions.
Still, widespread confusion about the policy exists among freshmen—the first members of the College to be affected. Of roughly two dozen first year students walking to eat lunch in Annenberg Tuesday, all said they were unsure of the policy’s current status. Some appeared to mix up the original penalties with the proposed social group ban.
“I don’t know exactly what they are,” said Phil A. Labrum ’21, referring to the penalties.
“I haven’t looked a lot into it,” said Braeden J. Foldenauer ’21.
Despite the uncertainty, data gathered in The Crimson’s annual survey of the incoming class indicate that the rollout of the policy may have had some effect—roughly 30 percent of surveyed freshmen indicated that they now had a less favorable opinion of final clubs because of the proposed social group ban, while 4 percent said they had a more favorable opinion.
The Class of 2021 also expressed a higher level of disinterest in joining social groups than any other incoming class surveyed in the last four years. Forty-one percent of surveyed students in the Class of 2021 indicated that they were “not at all interested” in joining a final club or Greek organization, as compared to 29 percent of the Class of 2020, 25 percent of the Class of 2019, and 23 percent of the Class of 2018.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After losing six starters from last year’s Ivy League championship squad to graduation, the Harvard women’s soccer team was bound to experience some growing pains in its season opener on Friday night. To make matters more difficult, the Crimson’s opponent, Providence, had already played two games to begin the season.
In the first half, those growing pains took the form of a stagnant offense as the visiting Friars outshot the hosts, 6-1. Harvard junior goalkeeper Danielle Etzel was up to the challenge, however, saving three shots on goal to preserve a scoreless tie heading into the intermission.
A half of soccer turned out to be enough to get the engine humming for the Crimson, as the team came out with more confidence and aggression after the break. Led by freshman forward Lauren Raimondo, Harvard launched five shots in a six-minute span at the start of the second half.
“In the first half, we were definitely unsteady,” captain Marie Becker said. “But I’m proud of how the team was able to catch itself, and restructure and reset so quickly.”
The pressure finally paid off in the 68th minute, after the Crimson had won a corner from the left side. Junior midfielder Leah Mohammadi swung the ball in. The ball sailed past a crowd of Harvard and Providence players and snuck beneath the crossbar, past the outstretched arm of Friars goalkeeper Shelby Hogan.
The impressive curl on the corner was all the Crimson (1-0-0) would need, as it closed out the game with its defense to notch its first win of the season, 1-0, over the Friars (0-3-0). The home victory marked the third win in the past four seasons for Harvard in the head-to-head series.
Unlike in the three previous years, however, the Crimson entered this year’s matchup without graduated star Midge Purce '17. A long-time talisman for the team, Purce scored or assisted on four goals against Providence over that three-year span.
On Friday, Harvard found itself relying on three underclassmen to spearhead its offense, including two who were playing in their collegiate debuts. Freshman forward Murphy Agnew was making her first career start, while Raimondo came off the bench for her debut.
“Right now, we’re still working out our attacking play,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “Whether it’s returning players or new players, it’s going to take some time to gel, but our progress from the first half to the second was a good indicator we’ll be hitting our stride soon.”
Even with untested forwards, however, it only takes one moment of individual brilliance to get on the scoreboard. That’s what Mohammadi provided with her “olimpico” goal, curling a corner kick directly into the back of the net. The junior, who played a key role off the bench in both of her first two years in Cambridge, once again provided a spark after coming on midway through the first half.
“Leah has been a genius for us at set pieces,” Becker said. “They helped us an incredible amount last season and this goal was just another instance of her ability to change a game.”
On the other side of the ball, it was a completely different story for Harvard. Becker led a back line that entered the game with 97 combined starts. Despite having one newcomer in that group—sophomore Kimaya Cole—the Crimson defense was able to capitalize on its overall experience and chemistry to secure its first shutout of the season.
Goalkeepers Etzel and Kat Hess were also instrumental in preserving the clean sheet, making a combined five saves on the night. Both players logged meaningful minutes last season and their level of comfort as the last line of defense showed.
Harvard will continue to rely on its defense and goalkeeping, but with a span of nine games in 25 days, it also hopes that the offense rounds into shape quickly.
“It’s going to be a collective effort this season,” Hamblin said. “But we have multiple threats and multiple ways we can win games, and I think we’ll pose challenges for our opposition.”

Ah, the sweet sound of back-to-school dining hall chatter. So optimistic, so upbeat. And yet, there are some individuals who have the ability to destroy the sanctity of this safe space: looking at you, summer study abroad students. We get it, you had a great time and drank a lot of alcohol. But please, turn the enthusiasm down a notch by following these basic guidelines:
“When I was in (insert European country here)…”
Whatever you do, avoid starting your sentences this way. Whatever follows is bound to make your peers unnecessarily jealous. Furthermore, we just don’t care about every detail of your European lifestyle. Keep your thoughts on the virtues of long dinners starting at 9 p.m. to yourself.
Excessive throwback Instagramming
You clogged up our feeds all summer, so give it a rest during the school year. We do not need to see your bikini pics from exotic Mediterranean destinations. It’s time to get back to term-time social media posts that we know and love—we’re talking 60’s pics with Crimson Key.
Ditching your friends for your study abroad friends
We’re tired of the excuse that only your study abroad friends get what you “went through,” like it was some shared trauma that merits a survivor group. We were your friends before you became a cool European, and that should count for something.
Eschewing traditional college fun for more ~cultured~ options
Do you think you’re too classy for beer pong these days now that you’ve done a few wine tastings? Don’t trade out red solo cups for stem-less wine glasses. This is college, let’s maintain some basic level of grossness. It’s only right. Save the $20 bottles of wine for your future consulting lifestyle.
Taking only three classes because you have extra class credits
It is somewhat of a joke that parading around France counts for two Harvard classes, but that’s how it is. If you’re one of the lucky returners from study abroad, you have the luxury of ditching that fourth class that’s too hard. But please, keep your happiness (and schedule) to yourself. We’re already jealous enough.
We know you had fun. We know you’re a “changed person”. But we’re already tired of hearing it. So if you catch yourself making any of these post-study abroad mistakes, don’t be surprised if we say to you: dude, that’s rude.

­All ye uninitiated take heed: Harvard is filled with a variety of gigantic, conflicting personalities, and how they manage to coexist in an environment this competitive remains an open question. (Alcohol may be involved.) New residents of this ever-surprising urban jungle must learn to recognize each of the tropes they’ll encounter and how to avoid the worst of the lot. Aren’t you glad you have Flyby to help?
THE CONFESSED PRE-MED
This is the person who asked your proctor whether he could petition to take five classes in the fall. He wants to get a secondary and a language citation and study abroad junior year. He will do anything to get you to reveal your midterm grades, and no matter what you say he will respond by putting in extra hours at Lamont.
Junior year he may start a club, which you will hear about over every email list you had the misfortune of signing up for. Do not sit with this person at Sunday brunch, because they will likely have gone on a run, set up an experiment at their HMS lab, and started a study group while you were still hitting the snooze button.
Useful Phrases: “Organic chemistry in the summer vs. organic chemistry during the school year: Go!” “No, really, my P.I. is the worst.” “How do you feel about the standard deviation on the midterms?” “My parents think this is a really good thing for me.”
Note: There is a subset of this species who are still in denial about their identity, and will not admit to being pre-med—even when cornered with an organic chemistry exam in their hand. They will attempt to disguise their identity by adopting slouchy clothes or shaggy hair or talking about how much of a slacker they are. Do not be fooled.
THE FERVENT ACTIVIST
After this person takes Societies of the World 25 freshman fall, you will have to sit through many dinner conversations about Paul Farmer. They join countless Facebook groups against hunger, poverty, and homelessness, and may even spend their summers in a country where they can experience all of the above. They might start wearing only organic, chemical-free clothing and get testy with the grill guy at Annenberg when he gives them non cage-free eggs.

After they take Social Studies 10 sophomore year, all the words in their vocabulary will grow a couple of syllables. Get ready to hear about the proto-fascistic nature of socially constructed heteronormative gender structures.
Useful phrases: “I think development is all about sustainability.” “But do you think this situation really exemplifies the Hegelian master-slave dialectic?” “What would Paul Farmer say about that?” “I just think that’s a really Western-centric—maybe even heteronormative—way of putting it.”
THE LITERARY TYPE 
This person manages to wear a scarf in a different way each day, though they haven’t showered since Easter. By your third week they will have ranked all of Harvard Square’s cafes, a list on which Café Pamplona will rank high (hipster!) and Dunkin’ Donuts will rank low (low-brow!). They will comp The Advocate and ask you if they are more of a “fiction” or “features” type of person, and you will have to make up an answer to that question.
Talking about your favorite books, movies, or music is always a dangerous endeavor with this person (prepare for feelings of inferiority). To play it safe, you would do well to make up a highly specific genre of music from a foreign country (e.g. 1950s Venezuelan jazz).
Useful phrases: “I wish Annenberg would invest in better coffee.” “Frankly, I much prefer Franzen’s earlier work.” “I just finished reading this wonderful piece in the New Yorker.”
THE FINAL CLUB BRO
You will not see this person sophomore fall because they are punching four clubs, and you will not see this person junior fall because they are punching four investment banks. They may talk of how their club is not like the “other clubs” that give everyone a bad name. They’ll tell you it’s just a bunch of nice dudes who like to have some beers together without the chicks around (except after midnight). This person has a great haircut and great shoes, both of which may or may not have been paid for by daddy’s credit card.
Useful phrases: “I just flew in from New York.” “Brah, when I was at Groton/Andover/Exeter…” “Sweet Sperry’s.” “I was just reading in the Journal that going forward Goldman might be hiring less.”
THE HOCO MEMBER
This person will bother you about playing IMs until you start to avoid them in the dining hall. This will be difficult, because they are always in there, more or less taking up residence in the d-hall. They are also the only one who knows the name of the kid on the 2nd floor in Math 55.
The person who’s always trying to organize an outing, a picnic, or a game of ultimate frisbee, the future HoCo (house committee) member is the one who’s trying to make the best of a bad situation—namely, Harvard’s social scene. This is a person you are likely to develop a love-hate relationship with as it takes a special type of personality to organize an ice cream social for 300 people who barely remember your name.
Useful phrases: “You know, I would love to help decorate for formal, but I have this exam tomorrow…” “Themes?! Ohmygod! I love themes.” “You had me at cookie decorating.” “I live for stein club.”
