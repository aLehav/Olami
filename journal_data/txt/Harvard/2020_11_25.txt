After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the ’80s, punk music and the scenes that supported it had been steadily growing in the U.S. and U.K. for almost a decade. So much had the punk movement grown that the classic and relatively homogenous scenes of the mid to late ’70s had broken off to create a whole new set of distinctions within the punk world. Classic punk splintered into hardcore punk, post-punk, new wave, street punk, anarcho-punk, pop punk — the list goes on and on.
Further south in Latin America, punk was becoming a nascent and powerful force at the turn of the decade, spurred on by the injection of these outside punk records into the Latin American airwaves and psyche alike.
Long-term political instability in some countries, wrought by a rotating cast of dictators and failed neocolonial policies, had meant that, for years, vinyl records were too expensive to reach a wide Latin American audience. While in the U.S. and U.K., where punk already thrived, records were affordable to most, in Latin America, they were much more of a luxury.
It was the advent of the cassette tape that effectively democratized music and spread it to the masses.The popularization of cassette tapes meant that music was not only cheaper but could also be quickly reproduced and recorded through do-it-yourself methods. Given the relative ease and accessibility to the global music scene afforded by cassettes, they served as a catalyst for burgeoning punk movements in Latin America. Young punks were able to listen to and share a much greater variety of artists than was originally possible, allowing many to take inspiration from these established bands and grow their own domestic punk movements.
Where elsewhere, punk had somewhat moved beyond the idea that it had to be created under and necessitated by political turmoil, the scenes cropping up in Latin America were inextricably linked to the politics of the time. From Peru to Argentina, punk scenes were a direct answer to the oppressive regimes that governed their founders.
In Peru, these early punks made music amid widespread instability: State-sanctioned murder, rampant violence, extreme poverty, and domestic terrorism all rocked the country and each influenced the country’s aspiring musicians. Raised on European punk and growing calls for political liberation, the Movida Subte (or subterranean movement) of the ’80s was built on the idea that punk should be and could be subversive. Prior to the movement, rock music in Peru had been largely inspired by the mainstream conventions of U.S. and U.K. ’70s rock. These old-school Peruvian rockers sang in English and focused on American and European themes rather than critiquing Peru’s own intense political landscape. The Movida Subte began very insularly, levied by small groups of university students who would serve as both artists and audience members.
Leusemia, created in 1983, was one of the first of these Subte bands. Born out of Lima, Peru, finding inspiration in sources as disparate as the Ramones and Pink Floyd, Leusemia’s music quickly became Subte anthems.
Songs like “Crisis en la gran ciudad,” for example, existed critically within an explicit political context, a common practice in the underground punk movement. “Todos quieren, nadie puede / El sistema es una birria / Todos buscan, nadie encuentra,” sings frontman Daniel F over an orchestrated chaos of incessant guitar riffs and powerful drumming — “Everyone wants, no one can have / The system is a disaster / Everyone looks, no one can find.” With such undeniably political lyrics, the band raged against actors on all sides of the ongoing internal conflict that had rocked Peru since May 17, 1980.
The two main actors in the conflict, the Maoist terrorist revolutionaries of Sendero Luminoso and the Peruvian state, both face reproval in Lusemia’s “La gran ciudad” for holding the already impoverished country hostage in a state of constant instability. The massive economic collapse caused by the state’s adoption of failed policies from the International Monetary Fund and the widespread violence carried out by both Sendero Luminoso and the government meant that Peru’s populous was caught between a rock and a hard place with very little room for mobility (as Leusemia scathingly points out). Though seemingly on opposite sides of the spectrum, Leusemia calls out these “fascistas” and “socialistas” all the same.
Other bands of the movement, like Narcosis, used similar political imagery in their music. As seen in the rest of the Subte movement, Narcosis’ lyrical themes included anarchy, activism, depression, the dangers of indoctrination, and Peru’s own political context. Their 1985 garage-recorded release, “Primera dosis,” is cited as “the most copied… and pirated album in the history of Peruvian rock music” — a feat which, like the very existence of the scene, was made possible by the proliferation of cassette tapes.
While punk loomed large in Peru, it wasn’t the only place where such movements were gaining speed.
“The punk movement in Argentina exists because I’m here and I’m one,” wrote Argentinian guitarist Pedro Braun, under the pseudonym Hari B, in a letter to the editor of a popular Buenos Aires music magazine. The statement was in response to the magazine’s claim that Argentina had no real, homegrown punk movement.
It was April 1978, and Argentina was in the bloodiest years of the Dirty War, a seven-year campaign by the country’s military dictatorship, backed by the U.S. government, against anyone believed to be associated with socialism or other leftist movements. Over almost a decade, the military junta eliminated over 30,000 people in a scheme that targeted students, writers, journalists, unionists, and artists of all kinds — including musicians who would have to lay low or use pseudonyms like Braun did in order to evade persecution from these right-wing actors.
Braun’s claim about the existence of an Argentinian punk scene made waves across Buenos Aires and attracted the attention of Sergio Gramátika, a drummer who decided to write to Braun as his “punk friend.” By 1981, the duo had recruited two more musicians to create Los Violadores, one of Argentina’s most influential punk pioneers.
Influenced by the likes of the Sex Pistols, The Clash, and The Ramones, Los Violadores made music that was just as free-spirited and loud as it was rooted in criticism of society and the state. In one of their first releases, “Represión,” for example, vocalist Pil Trafa sings of “fútbol,” wine, and all the other empty pastimes that occupy the Argentinian “pueblo.” To complement Trafa’s cries against the dangers that this repression poses to the masses, Gramátika, Hari B, and the rest of the band jam in the background with powerful instruments and fuzzy, sludgy production that only adds to the intensity of the track.
In another track, “Somos Latinoamerica,” the band emphasizes the need for a Latin American identity that is separate from outside, neocolonialist forces like the United States. Given the U.S.’s involvement in promoting the Dirty War, lyrics like “Hay que acabar / Con la cultura de afuera / Hagamos la nuestra” (“We have to finish / With the outside culture / Let’s make our own”) are especially powerful. At the same time as the song calls out the outside political demagogues and “exploiters,” it calls out Latin American ones as well, making the cutting joke that just like culture in Latin America is better than the one imposed from abroad, the political opportunists at home are better, too.
For Los Violadores to create such politically driven and insurgent music was in itself a dangerously subversive act. Even their name was sometimes seen as too controversial for the repressive right-wing regime that held power at the time. In the early years of the band’s existence, censorship from the military junta meant that they would sometimes have to perform as “Los Voladores,” or the flying ones, rather than Los Violadores, which referred to their rule-breaking.
Of course, Peru and Argentina weren’t the only Latin American countries with growing punk scenes. With the new waves of democracy traversing the region in the ’80s came a large influx of punk bands. The movement was broad, spanning from Olho Seco in Sao Paulo, Brazil to Los Prisioneros in Chile. Across the board, these movements were born both as critiques and reflections of the political realities that continue to manifest in Latin America today.

The year is 1988 in Seoul, South Korea. This is the era of choppy bobs, imported Walkmans, and an insatiable obsession with denim, a time when adolescents commiserating over college entrance exams fawned over American actors like Lindsay Wagner and Pierce Brosnan. The world trained its eyes on South Korea as it prepared for the 1988 Summer Olympics. A grinning cartoon tiger danced below the five Olympic rings on t-shirts, magazines, and banners across the country. This was it: the time for the nation to demonstrate its transformation from a war-torn geopolitical proxy into a paragon of modernity. Citizens everywhere held their breath, vaguely aware that they were on the precipice of something monumental.
I’m sprawled on the basement couch of my home in the suburbs of Chicago, eating tangerines with my family as we watch the Korean drama “Reply 1988.” Transported to a time when cell phones were revolutionary and people still used charcoal to start their stoves, I feel deeply nostalgic for an era I never experienced.
During the past years, Korean dramas have expanded into something so much more than a trivial pastime, taking on a cultural and commercial currency of their own. Dramas including “My Love From Another Star,” “Descendents of the Sun,” “Goblin,” and “Crash Landing on You” have catapulted to international stardom, garnering dedicated fans from New York to Brazil to Jakarta. Among these behemoths rises one show that has arguably topped them all in managing to pull mercilessly at the heartstrings of viewers across generations: “Reply 1988.”
“Reply 1988” revolves around five teenagers who have known each other since childhood, chronicling their achingly familiar transition to adulthood. The middle-class neighborhood called Ssangmun-dong, where the majority of the story takes place, meticulously foregrounds the show. From the ancient jeweler’s shop at the street corner to the giant house of the brusque yet warm-hearted Jung-Hwan (Ryoo Joon-Yeol) under which the female protagonist Duk-Sun (Hyeri) lives, each place is engineered to serve a certain purpose that becomes clear as the show progresses. Every small detail — from textbooks and crumbled chip bags to the plastic trophies arranged on dusty cabinets — imbues the characters’ homes with a chaotic, believable immediacy.
What “Reply 1988” does so astoundingly well is to construct a cinematic framework that allows characters — and, by extension, viewers — to engage in dynamic, unpredictable conversation with the past. Though the story begins with the quintet on the cusp of adulthood, the 16-episode series follows their progress through college and, for some, marriage. The show’s linear development is punctuated with video recordings in which the characters, now in their mid-forties, ruminate on their adolescence. The addicting yet maddening aspect of these flash-forwards is that the characters’ nostalgic recollections are kept intentionally vague. As the love triangle between Duk-Sun and two others from the quintet develops, viewers are placed in a state of continual anticipation, scrutinizing the potential meaning behind every gesture.
As portrayed so masterfully in “Reply 1988,” being in conversation with the past is an inevitable part of being human. Whether it be to enlightening or traumatizing effect, people are constantly narrativizing the past, distorting what was into what could have been. Though the COVID-19 pandemic has altered every element of our lives, the most radical change has arguably been its influence on our relationships with the past. The quarantine has forced us to accommodate double lives. Activities that were once exceedingly ordinary have grown to take on profound meaning. Retrospecting from the confines of our homes confers new significance to simpler times when we were ignorant of what was to come. The jarring disruption that is COVID-19 promotes not just retrospection but also, inevitably, nostalgia— an intense longing for the unrealized plans, the stymied resolutions, the spontaneous interactions that were snuffed out before they could even begin.
To contemplate the past is neither inherently good nor bad — it is simply an intrinsic part of attempting to more intimately understand ourselves. What is admirable about “Reply 1988” is its exercise of cinematic restraint. The show extends no specific argument about the function of the retrospective gaze in the construction of identity. Rather, it simply underscores the importance of memory in remembering and creating who we are. Whether the act of looking back is beneficial or destructive, expansive or confining, is a choice reserved for the viewer alone. The show’s reflections on memory as a source of warmth, perspective, and dynamic introspection are an apt reminder in a time when we can’t help but collectively look back at what was and what might have been.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am 21 years old. Five people I know have shared with me that they were raped, but who knows how many I am unaware of.
I want to give a trigger warning here, because in writing this piece, I don’t want to root up pain for survivors or loved ones of survivors out there. And I want you to know, I’m writing this for us.
Growing up, rape and sexual violence evoked a sickening fear in me with every mention — a reaction that came long before any sex-talk or elementary school maturation night. I remember taking a bath, maybe three or four years old, and my mom warning me not to let anyone touch me inappropriately, even an uncle. At age eight, I heard about my cousin’s neighbor who was arrested for having child pornography. As eleven-year-olds in sixth grade, with barely a sense of what sex even was, my friends and I all anounced that we would rather die than be raped. Barely 15, I lay in bed, heartbroken and haunted by the story of Elizabeth A. Smart, a 12-year-old girl who was kidnapped from her home, brutally raped, and sexually assaulted for nine months before being rescued. When I was a college sophomore living abroad for a year in Hong Kong, a man followed me and my friend down dimly lit streets with a manic grin on his face. The two of us only escaped on a well-timed train. But later on separate occasions several months apart, a different friend and I were both groped on the very vehicle of my previous rescue.
Anyone reading this who thinks I or my experiences are an anomaly is both blissfully and unsettlingly ignorant. I say “blissful,” because you don’t know the inescapable harm and danger women (and people of other gender identities) face; “unsettled,” because you could very well be part of the problem. And I can’t help but resent your removedness — I resent that you live a life removed from, with a blind eye turned to, these tragedies.
Every 73 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. A 2015 survey found that nearly 50 percent of transgender people are sexually assaulted in their lifetimes. Twenty-six percent of female undergraduates experience rape or sexual assault through physical force or violence. That’s roughly 13 women in your large General Education course, or one in your seminar.
One in six American women is a victim of rape or attempted rape. One in six. Take a group of women: Let’s say your sister, close friend, two random classmates, a cousin, and your mom. It could be any one.
How grateful I am for the Me Too and Time’s Up movements, which have shed a little more light on what so many have experienced. Sexual assault, rape, violence, are as pervasive as they are depraved. As damaging as they are vicious.
But the world has repeatedly told me that sexual violence doesn’t matter. While there are a lot of tasteless and sickening jokes out there, the rape and sexual assault jokes stab my heart and put a knot in my stomach like none other. Shows like “Family Guy” and “South Park” crack rape jokes that could only be funny to those who don’t get what rape is, or are capable of committing the atrocity themselves. As a young girl, my cousin recounted to me, crying with laughter, fictional “comedic” YouTube videos of women being sexually assaulted by TSA workers. In high school, a football player told me point blank that sexual assault “wasn’t a big deal,” as he dismissed the numerous sexual assault allegations against Donald J. Trump. And in 2018, 50 U.S. senators, including the two from my home state, told me the same thing when they voted to confirm Brett M. Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court. Many other Americans loudly agreed.
So what does this have to do with Harvard? We’re woke. We opposed Kavanaugh’s confirmation. We have Title IX and that extra “Interim Other Sexual Misconduct Policy” to account for conduct that falls outside of the new Title IX regulations. Harvard and its students all care about sexual violence, don’t they?
Well, maybe you didn’t catch Twitter accounts from the past year like How H* Failed Me, which share in horrifying volume the mass of individuals who have experienced sexual violence at the hands of Harvard affiliates. Or maybe I wasn’t clear enough that a good chunk of those five people I mentioned at the beginning are Harvard students. And from what they’ve told me, so are their rapists.
I’ve barely been at Harvard for two years. To already know so many who have suffered at the hands of my peers evokes deadening pain I cannot describe. Experience and statistics tell me rapists are often not the men following you down the street, but those we know.
So to everyone reading this, rape and other sexual assaults are not rarities that occur outside of your sphere of influence — though that should not make a difference in your awareness and determination to stop it. Sexual violence is a rampant part of your life and the lives of those around you, whether you currently recognize it or not.
A quarter of female undergraduates have been raped or violently sexually assaulted. Harvard is no anomaly. What are you going to do about it?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To most, March 15 – the day when many cities, including Cambridge, closed nonessential businesses in the face of the fast-growing pandemic – seems like an era away.
To business owners in Cambridge, it was the start of an arduous few months.
Many had to halt business until Cambridge’s Phase II reopening in May to June of 2020, and those that retained online sales or delivery are still struggling with a diminished consumer base.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said various Cambridge local businesses have permanently closed within the past few months. Others are anticipating whether they will be able to survive into the spring, with some negotiating rental costs with property owners, Jillson said.
Jillson said HSBA put together a committee to evaluate the dire situation the pandemic forced onto small businesses.
“Within a few weeks we went to work with the city on a small business advisory committee to think about what businesses were going to look like when they eventually opened up and what kind of guidelines needed to be put in place,” she said.
With businesses across the country suffering during the pandemic, those in Cambridge are especially struggling with the loss of their typical student customer base and uncertainty about when they will ever return in full force. These challenges, coupled with statewide health and safety restrictions and rising coronavirus cases, have business owners bracing for a cold, difficult winter.
Despite a smaller number of patrons, businesses in Harvard Square are surviving after the spring shutdown by relying on takeout and outdoor operations. Some owners, however, say that these changes aren’t enough to rebound from the aftershocks of the spring.
Various business owners noted that the arrival of some Harvard students helped their business significantly.
Alex W. Meriwether, general manager of the Harvard Book Store, said that the influx of students this fall, albeit only 25 percent of the usual student body, improved business notably.
“The first six weeks of the fall was the first stretch of time that felt like somewhat of a routine, for the first time in many months,” he said. “I think that feeling was important because of the return of some students to campus.”
Philip J. Rizzuto, the owner of Lizzy’s ice cream, echoed this sentiment, saying that sales over the past two and a half months have increased from 30 to 70 percent as some College students came to campus.
“We want to thank our incredible group of loyal customers who have really stuck with us during this time,” he said. “The old saying about 80 percent of your business coming from 20 percent of your customers rings really true for us now.”
Pinocchio’s Pizza managed to bring in enough customers to keep the business going this fall, according to owner Adam DiCenso.
“Things began to pick up a little, we were able to kind of scale back a lot of the hours of our employees, we never had to let anybody go,” said DiCenso.
Because Pinocchio’s Pizza is a predominantly takeout spot, DiCenso said they were able to retain some of their business without dining restrictions and the cold weather having too much of an impact, an advantage that Hokkaido Ramen Santouka has also tried to replicate.
However, Santouka customers gravitate more towards indoor dining, with the majority still choosing to sit inside, per Takahiro Igo, the Director of Food’s Style USA, which manages Santouka.
“We have a partition between the tables,” Igo said. “For now, it’s dining in more than takeout – it’s getting more and more.”
Saloniki Greek has found success through its takeout services, but Jonathan Mendez, COO and co-founder, said his restaurant has been hit hard by the most recent restrictions requiring restaurants to stop dine-in service at 9:30 p.m.
Mendez said that moving the closing time up 30 minutes — from its normal 10 p.m. time — has slowed business for Saloniki at night.
“The biggest issue that we're fighting right now is consumer anxiety,” he said. “That half hour actually translates to two hours because customers don't want to be rushed.”
Third party delivery services provide another obstacle to regaining revenue for restaurants, with high commission fees being a subject of contention for many owners.
Angela Dela Cruz ’24, a student on campus this fall, said that she never had to rely on delivery apps until the dine-in curfew was implemented, and even now she is eating out less because of the hefty price that comes with using these services.
“It makes it difficult to order because using apps isn’t free,” Dela Cruz said. “So you have to pay for delivery and service – and that also makes me hesitant to order.”
Duncan Browne, the director of field operations and business administration of Newbury Comics, said his business has taken a dramatic hit due to the pandemic. Newbury’s business relative to the same time last year is down around 25 to 30 percent.
“The Harvard Square store has, quite frankly, been struggling,” he said. “So it doesn't feel like a vibrant, healthy, lively student and commerce Mecca the way it once did so.”
Businesses owners have had to learn how to adapt to both safety and service restrictions imposed during the pandemic — some largely without much guidance from local authorities.
Santouka Ramen is attracting customers with their loyalty program, which sends out promotions and announcements about their safety measures to members. Both have initiated a substantial response from customers, according to Igo.
Similarly, the Harvard Bookstore joined the American Booksellers Association in pioneering their “Buy Early” initiative in mid-October, which garnered a huge online response, Meriwether said. Newbury Comics is gearing up for the holiday season with social media marketing and an increased stockpiling of gift items in stores.
“We are doing what we can to, you know, to encourage folks to come out and shop,” Browne said.
Rizzuto said that Lizzy’s has worked hard to expand their base to graduate students and year round residents.
“The local community in Cambridge has been fantastic in spreading the word about our business, sharing our social media page and generating interest in our product,” he wrote.
Some businesses say that they have been largely on their own during the pandemic, with little help, owners say, from Cambridge officials.
To Mendez, the past nine months demonstrated lack of communication from local government about health policy and funding.
“We always just try to follow best practices, but unfortunately, as a result of this lack of guidance or direction, we've been left on our own to try to figure things out,” he said.
Mendez said that he wished that the Cambridge city government would recognize that restaurants are a “public good.” Igo agreed and added that even though Santouka might get funding for outdoor heaters during the winter, he hopes for more help.
“I believe all the owners of the businesses want to have a direct relief program,” he said. “Just money will be the best thing, so I hope the city can consider that.”
The City of Cambridge did not respond to a request for comment.
Even without governmental direction, both Santouka and Newbury Comics instituted high degrees of new safety protocols in their stores.
“It was not mandatory, but at the beginning, in the middle of March, we just started and we bought a bunch of a mask and a bunch of gloves for [employees],” Takahiro said.
Browne noted that his team actually scored cleaning protocols from all of Newbury’s locations and adopted the most meticulous policies around employer safety that were instituted by Rhode Island.
Regardless of the fluctuating level of government involvement, small businesses owners said they are supporting each other. According to Meriwether, he included nanoseptic on his door handles after seeing the self-cleaning substance on handles at Cambridge Trust Bank.
Business owners in Harvard Square have largely agreed that it could take them over a year to get back fully on their feet.
“Timing is going to be key for us,” Rizzuto wrote. “If we can salvage a good portion of the summer, I think we can recover fully by the end of 2022 or so. If summer's a dud, then all bets are off.”
Browne, similarly, said that Newbury Comics could see revenues as they did before the pandemic by September 2022.
With businesses heavily relying on a customer base made up of Harvard students, attentive owners have been awaiting the College’s next move in hopes of the possibility of bringing back more students.
“I don’t know if this is still the case, but a few months back, I think Harvard was considering keeping an open mind to invite back the seniors and possibly some of the freshmen,” Rizzuto said.
“I wish the Square was lousy with students with nothing but money to spend, but, you know, I understand why it's not,” Browne added.
The College has not yet announced how many students will be allowed back on campus in the spring. Administrators are expected to announce their decision by early December.
Jillson said the HSBA is also taking concrete actions to preserve businesses in the area. Entering December, the organization is gearing up to encourage local holiday shopping.
“Our plan is to make the square as pretty as we possibly can,” Jillson said. “We're getting ready to decorate with holiday decorations, and we’re putting up more this year not less.”
“We are trying to promote those businesses that are here,” she added.
Browne said that the economic problems extend much further than just the individual businesses and that Harvard Square’s future as a whole is at stake.
“Harvard Square is not what it once was,” he said. “[It] used to be incredibly unique, and had dozens and dozens of retailers and restaurants that you never would see anywhere else.”
“And I think it's in the process of losing its soul,” Browne added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The majority of students living in residence this fall departed Harvard’s campus by the College’s fall move-out date on Sunday. Left behind, though, are a number of undergraduates who are quarantining and isolating on the empty campus into the holiday break.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email last week that Harvard’s protocols and “allow for and encourage” students in isolation and quarantine to remain on campus past the Nov. 22 move out date.
He added that if a student is sick, recently tested positive, or is in quarantine after suspected contact with someone who tested positive in the last 14 days, they should delay travel until their period of isolation or quarantine is complete, in accordance with current Center for Disease Control recommendations. The College is providing those undergraduates with housing, food, and daily testing.
In a follow-up email, Khurana also shared newly released information from the State of Massachusetts to higher education institutions regarding isolation and quarantine policy.
The revised Department of Public Health guidance states that students currently in quarantine due to a COVID-19 exposure may leave after 10 days — instead of 14 days — if they are symptom-free and test negative on the eighth day of their quarantine or later. Students currently in isolation due to a positive COVID-19 test must remain sequestered until completing the 10-day isolation period.
Across the nation, people are weighing whether to reunite with family and friends for the holiday or to commit to social distancing guidelines. Warning that holiday travel could lead to a spike in COVID-19 cases, the CDC advised people to stay put for Thanksgiving. It urged those who must travel to avoid contact with non-household members for 14 days prior.
When students signed the Residential Community Compact in order to return to campus this fall, they pledged to abide by all quarantine and isolation requirements, Khurana wrote.
“If you fail to observe quarantine or isolation requirements related to this updated guidance, you will be referred to the Community Council and may lose eligibility for housing in future terms,” he wrote. “If you are quarantining but it is necessary for you to leave campus, we want to remind you that anyone within the quarantine window can test positive at any point.”
Khurana also warned undergraduates that family members may be exposed to infection during transit or once they arrive at their home. He also reminded students that anyone traveling during this quarantine period should travel only by a private car driven by a family member and not a car service or rideshare or airplane or train or public transit.
Tresor M. Nshimiye ’24 — who is set to leave quarantine on Wednesday — said his family had planned to drive up from Ohio last Saturday and bring him home. But these plans were dashed when he was instructed to quarantine after an exposure to a student who tested positive for the virus. Now, he is no longer able to spend the holiday with his family.
“I really missed out on the opportunity to share a Thanksgiving meal,” he said. “It feels like campus is a ghost town.”
Audrey N. Kang ’24 said she was supposed to fly home on Sunday. But after she came in contact with a fellow student who tested positive for COVID-19, she had to cancel her flight and begin a period of quarantine, remaining on campus for that duration.
“None of us want to bring on the plane and none of us want to bring COVID-19 back to our families,” Kang said. “So even if the chances are low, I decided it’s still better to stay a little longer.”
Kang finished her 10-day quarantine period Tuesday after testing negative, but she said she chose to remain in quarantine for the full 14 days until Saturday due to the uncertainty of when she should book her new flight home.
Though Kang won’t spend Thanksgiving at home, she said she is excited to celebrate the holiday with her friends on campus.
“We have a friend who lives in the Boston area who will drop off turkey and stuff outside the dorms, and we’ll hang out on Zoom” she said. “We're gonna have a Harvard quarantine Thanksgiving!”
