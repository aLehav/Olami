Back on campus early and trying to avoid eating cheap pizza until the dining halls reopen? Before kicking your brain into high gear, take your taste buds on a gastronomical tour of Harvard Square. This year’s Summer Restaurant Week, which began this past Sunday, continues through August 30 (though it will take a day off this coming Saturday).
Participating restaurants include Henrietta's Table, The Maharaja, Nubar, OSUSHI, The Red House, Rialto, Russell House Tavern, Temple Bar, Toscano, and UpStairs on the Square. All will feature fixed menus for multi-course lunches and dinners.
Be warned, though; these discounted meals will still cost you. Unless otherwise noted, three-course dinners will set you back $38.13 and three-course lunches go for $20.13—and that's even before factoring in the cost of drinks, tax, and a tip. 
If you're looking to enjoy Summer Restaurant Week's fine dining while not breaking the bank, we recommend the two-course lunches, which are priced at a more reasonable $15.13. Bon appétit!
