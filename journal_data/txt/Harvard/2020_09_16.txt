After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I remember a story about the Charles River.
I used to go there all the time — before the pandemic, before the shutdowns, before the skies turned bright orange and everything came to a halt. I used to go there with friends — we’d sit on the ledge, drink bitter, overpriced wine, smoke. One of us was a student at the Harvard-Berklee dual program. Sometimes she sang for us, beautiful, chilling songs, laughing nervously between verses. We’d clap, laugh, talk. Complain about our days and our families and our classes. And we’d lean right over the bridge, staring into the river below.
There’s a bunch of old Harvard traditions — you’re supposed to pee on John Harvard, hook up in the stacks, run naked at primal scream, and jump from Weeks Bridge into the Charles.  They’re exactly the kind of moves that seem like a great idea when you find yourself bored at 4 a.m. in the Yard; the ones that make great videos and terrible stories.
And indeed, over the course of the year we as a group got to all of them — all but one. We never jumped into the Charles.
Sure, we got close. We peered over the edge, alternating between daring each other to take the leap and stopping drunken friends from doing so. The water level always seemed too low, the warmer spring months on campus never arrived. We made plans, time and time again, to jump the very next weekend. But we never did.
We never jumped because of a story, a true story. The story of a young student who’d tried and failed, who’d hurt himself as he landed and drowned. We never got the specifics — it had become the kind of tale that changes with every repetition. But the idea itself, the tragedy, was burned into our brains. It instilled not so much fear as respect; a sense that something distinctly real and soul-crushing had happened right there
Over the past few weeks, I’ve found myself thinking about that story. Our reticence seemed outsized — a single tragedy doesn’t tell you that much about a situation’s safety. We might have dived into the river and emerged intact; the whole thing could have proven less dangerous and more sanitary than climbing that remarkably (and regrettably) slippery statue.
Yet the story was powerful. Not in spite of being confined to a single victim, but precisely because of it. The student wasn’t another number within a broader bridge-jumping statistic; he wasn’t part of an abstract idea of routine safety practices. He was an individual human being, the one who jumped into the Charles — and he was dead.
Our ability to sympathize with others, to fully recognize their humanity, works in weird ways. We can process individual deaths — we can try to grasp their full weight, to understand the scope of the loss. But what happens when a single death becomes a thousand, a hundred thousand, a million? What happens when a single, preventable event ravages entire countries for months?
It reminds me of that feeling you sometimes get when you’re walking down a crowded street. You stare at a bunch of people and, for a fraction of a second, you understand their humanity; you realize they are individuals concerned about their own days, their own families, their own jobs. But we don’t have the bandwidth to deal with that forever, and so we quickly revert to a functional, lifeless perspective. The cashier exists only as a cashier, and only at that specific point in time and space; that guy with the dog is little more than a piece of the scenery: a prop, an extra.
When it comes to death, we act in a remarkably similar way. We can deal with the loss of one person fully, in-depth, for a contained period of time; but trying to do so with a thousand a day is simply unbearable. Some studies suggest that that fact isn’t incidental, but rather a defense mechanism; a way to avoid being completely overcome by emotion. In other words, we care less about deaths as they rise because not doing so could prove entirely unsustainable. We see the kid at the river, we really see him. His death is, for a lack of a better word, emotionally concentrated. Nine hundred and thirty thousand deaths (and counting) are not. And so goes the old dictum: one death is a tragedy; a million are a statistic. And so, the Charles inspires respect, but wearing a mask seems like an annoying (albeit crucial) chore.
But when lives become numbers and numbers become large enough to be meaningless our brains’ defense mechanism renders us apathetic. Is there really any sizable emotional shift when a death toll increases from one to two hundred thousand? To a million? We watch the numbers rise, day after day, unfazed; we study curves and graphs, not stories.
Amid this massive — nearly incomprehensible — loss of human life, we must not lose our own humanity by erasing that of those who have died. We can not become numb to the sheer pain and anger that ought to be moving all of us. We have to let it hurt.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s 5 p.m. on a Thursday in October. You’ve just had a long, lucrative day at the office, and as you leave, your co-worker asks about your plans for the evening. “It’s Thursday, we’re going to the symphony,” you reply.
You enter your home at 5:15 and greet your lovely wife, JD in hand for cocktail hour. Your kids present drawings of astronauts they made at school that day. After finishing your drink, you change into your evening suit. There’s a knock at the door. It’s the babysitter. You wish her a good night as you and your wife get in the car and drive into the city, where you have dinner reservations at your favorite sushi restaurant. The sashimi and sake are excellent as always, and you finish by 7:45. You walk to Symphony Hall, find your reserved seats on the first balcony, and enjoy a night of Mozart, Beethoven, and Brahms. The concert starts at 8:05 and is over by 10:20. You return to your car and drive home, arriving back at 10:50 to pay the babysitter and retire to bed.
Perhaps this was your grandparents’ weekly routine fifty years ago, but it’s probably not yours. Unlike most people today, they probably grew up listening to classical music and valued the chance to hear it performed live. Decades later though, these people frankly aren’t here anymore. They’ve either passed or are too old to attend a concert in-person.
And yet, orchestras in America still largely assume this antiquated lifestyle for their patrons. Weekly tickets cost thousands of dollars a year, which doesn’t include considerations for parking or childcare. Most performances begin at 8 p.m., to give time for dinner out after work, and let out well after 10, even though a significant portion of their patronage is retired. An unspoken symphony etiquette is highly emphasized; any extraneous audience noise reduces the purity of the performance for others.
One look at the people around you and it’s obvious that there is a single demographic to which orchestras cater: the white, wealthy, and elderly. Retirement centers frequently send entire vans of their residents to classical performances, and ushers rush to help those with walkers, canes, and wheelchairs through the queue to their seats. Every performance is a well-choreographed dance to get the most frail slice of America into a large auditorium. And to what end? Impossibly tight budgets have led to extended lockouts, strikes, and bankruptcy filings of the major orchestras in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Indianapolis, St. Paul, and Atlanta — all just in the past decade.
Orchestras desperately need new patronage, but attending a concert for the first time as a young person is difficult. There are so many prerequisites — an interest in classical music, money and time in the evening to spare, and some awareness of concert etiquette— that it’s no surprise most people simply don’t even try, or go once and never return. A chance to dress up with a date and attend a concert seems like a good idea, until this never-ending Mozart piano concerto sounds like musical sawdust, and you’re then turned off of classical music for years to come. Or, as an enthusiastic classical music neophyte, you mistakenly clap at the end of the first movement of Prokofiev’s Fifth, prompting shushes from those around you. The traditional classical performance is simply a user-unfriendly experience that keeps newcomers out.
As classical music becomes less relevant to younger generations, orchestra concerts are becoming lonely places, even as music continues to thrive elsewhere. The average college student has a vast knowledge of current artists and their artistic output, and discovers new music every day. Yet classical music, the home genre of some of the brightest and most well-received musicians, is relegated to dusty corners and bottom shelves. To let centuries of stimulating music be forgotten, simply because of an intimidation scheme, would be a gross disservice to ourselves. Art is not expendable like that.
In the spirit of the current national push for inclusion, orchestras need to launch their own inclusion campaign: one that actively welcomes all ages to their events. If they want a younger audience, they’ll have to first introduce their best music to young people where they congregate: on streaming services and social media platforms. If you were to begin exploring classical music, a vast genre that defies generalization, would you know where to start? What if orchestras had easy-access playlists of the most exciting and short classical pieces in the repertoire, that continuously suggested more music based on your preferences?
It would finally establish a pipeline of younger fans and eventually pay dividends for struggling American arts organizations and their newly devoted listeners.
Who belongs at an orchestra concert? You do. There is classical music for you, and everyone of all tastes. The music industry just hasn’t done a good job of showing you where to look.

The Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers approved recommendations that will limit the number of members of the Board of Overseers who are nominated via petitions, rather than the Alumni Association's nominating committee, to six out of 30 seats at any given time.
The policy change — announced in a letter from William F. Lee '72, the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation, and R. Martin Chávez, the president of the Board of Overseers — was one of a number of recommendations in a report by a special committee of the Board of Overseers’s Election Working Group.
The approved recommendations — which come after a successful petition campaign advocating for fossil fuel divestment elected three members to the Board of Overseers last month — emphasize the need for the Board of Overseers to include a “strong preponderance of members who have been nominated for the Overseers ballot by a duly appointed nominating committee.”
The Board of Overseers is composed of 30 members elected in slates of five to serve six-year terms. As a result of the change, over the next five slates, a maximum of three members who are nominated by a petition may be elected to serve. The other 24 members must join the board after being nominated by the Harvard Alumni Association’s Nominating Committee.
“This approach will reinforce the essential role of the nominating committee – itself a diverse group of dedicated alumni who are appointed by the Harvard Alumni Association’s volunteer leadership and who include three current or recent Overseers,” Lee and Chávez wrote. “It will help assure that promising candidates identified by the nominating committee will be willing to stand for election.”
“It will preserve, with a reasonable limit, Harvard’s longstanding practice of allowing individuals the chance to qualify for the Overseers ballot by petition – an option that some have suggested might be discontinued,” they added.
The Board of Overseers Election Working Group was formed in 2015, and most recently, in 2019, helped introduce an online voting option. The special committee of alumni and Overseers behind the most recent recommendations was led by Margaret H. Marshall, the former chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
The Harvard Corporation and Board of Overseers also approved mandating close monitoring of campaign “trends and practices” in future elections to determine whether the structure of campaign activities must be changed.
The effort to monitor campaigns stems from a concern that “the annual Overseers elections not come to assume the character of partisan, platform-driven campaigns for political office, including fundraising and spending, extensive use of social media, and dedicated campaign organizations,” Lee and Chávez wrote.
The governance boards also adopted several recommendations to increase engagement from recent graduates, another central tenet of the petition campaign Harvard Forward ran this year.
Those measures, also listed in the letter, include encouraging the Harvard Alumni Association to “intensify its efforts to nominate outstanding recent graduates,” placing at least one recent graduate on visiting committees for various schools, and inviting at least one recent graduate to serve on the governing boards’ joint committee on alumni affairs and development.
The special committee’s report referenced both Harvard Forward and other recent petition campaigns, noting that there is “no reason to presume that the recent developments in Harvard’s Overseers elections will be transitory, rather than a preview of what the future might hold.”
In 2016, a slate of candidates known as “Free Harvard, Fair Harvard” called for the University to eliminate tuition and affirmative action. Though the members of the slate qualified for that year's ballot, none won seats on the Board.
“We are concerned by the prospect that, without a change in the current system, the Board might before long come to be populated more by members of issue-driven caucuses, sponsored by advocacy groups, and less by individuals who have emerged from a deliberative process in which a nominating committee focuses on their capacity to fulfill the broad-ranging responsibilities of board service,” the report reads. “We regard these concerns as sufficiently significant to warrant a change in current methods.”
Philip W. Lovejoy, Executive Director of the HAA, informed alumni of the change in an email Tuesday.
The University and Harvard Forward did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rodney’s Bookstore in Central Square will close this fall and reopen at a yet-to-be-determined new location, according to its owner, Shaw Taylor.
The move comes as Rodney’s — known for selling used and discounted new books, in addition to bookshelves and posters — celebrates its 21st anniversary at its Central Square location.
Taylor said the store is moving because his lease is up, not due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
“My landlord told me that I had to be out — this is way, way back in beginning of February,” he said. “It was before the whole pandemic. The landlord’s just going in another direction.”
While Taylor said the pandemic did not motivate the move, it has affected his store’s operations nonetheless. Rodney’s closed its doors for three months earlier this year, per public health guidelines, and Taylor said the pandemic may affect the store’s reopening after the move.
“It is affected by the pandemic, because I might wait for the vaccine,” he said. “Or I just might wait for the right spot, which may take me into the spring. But I’m committed to reopening.”
Taylor said he will “stay to the very end” of his lease — October 31 — before loading the remaining books and bookshelves into his van. He said he hopes to reopen somewhere in Cambridge but has not yet found a location.
“My plan is to open somewhere in Cambridge, but I knew I couldn’t do two rents or two places at the same time just because of staffing and money,” he said. “The earliest I would reopen — the very earliest — would be December.”
Still, he said he does have some concerns about how the new location can live up to his current storefront.
“Where I am now, I don’t know if I can duplicate that, you know?” he said. “The size is right. The windows are nice. The T’s right there. It’s got a lot going for it. But I’ll find something, and I’ll make it nice.”
Peyton M. Benac ’21, who said she often walked to Rodney’s Bookstore during her first few years of college, said she is “to some degree concerned” about where Rodney’s Bookstore will end up.
“I hope that they are able to settle into one of these other neighborhoods — maybe one of the squares in Somerville or something — where they can get enough space to have the same kind of environment,” she said.
“I always really liked Rodney’s when I was spending time in Central,” she added, calling the bookstore a “staple” of the neighborhood.
Taylor said the situation is difficult for his local customers who have supported the store over the years.
“It’s sad for the customers because this is our 21st year,” he said. “A lot of them that live in the Central Square area — they will be disappointed if I end up in Porter Square or wherever. We’ve been here long enough so that people have lived with us, essentially.”

Roughly 75 people, including multiple Harvard affiliates, gathered in front of Government Center in Boston Tuesday to protest a court ruling that allowed the Trump administration to end protections for approximately 300,000 immigrants shielded from deportation under the Temporary Protected Status program.
On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, based in California, ruled in a 2-1 decision that the Trump administration could legally terminate the program, known as TPS, for immigrants from El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan.
The ruling reverses a preliminary injunction issued by Judge Edward M. Chen of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California in October 2018 preventing the Trump administration from ending the protections.
Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, who wrote the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, based the court’s decision on the plaintiffs’ inability to demonstrate “racial animus” as a motivating factor in the decision to end TPS protections.
“The district court cited no evidence linking the President’s [racial] animus to the TPS terminations—such as evidence that the President personally sought to influence the TPS terminations, or that any administration officials involved in the TPS decision-making process were themselves motivated by animus,” Callahan wrote.
Congress created TPS in 1990 to provide a temporary reprieve from deportation to certain immigrants whose countries of origin were deemed unsafe. Currently, individuals from nearly a dozen countries are protected through the program, although U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to strip TPS status since nearly the beginning of his term in office.
Monday’s decision, though, will likely not be the last word on the subject. In light of the Ninth Circuit’s decision, the plaintiffs in the case plan to file an appeal. A potential Biden administration could reinstate TPS protections.
Nonetheless, news of the decision left some of Harvard’s TPS recipients in tears.
Doris Reina-Landaverde, a custodial worker from El Salvador who rallied the crowd at Tuesday’s protest, said the news was heartbreaking, as she recognized that the court’s decision was a major setback for her and her family.
“When I received the news yesterday, it was devastating because I had hope that the outcome would be positive,” said Reina-Landaverde, an organizer with the Massachusetts TPS alliance. “When I saw the message, it was hard, I’m not going to lie and tell you that I didn’t cry.”
“I crossed the border and survived, why should I be scared of fighting for my family, my TPS family,” she added.
Reina-Landaverde, who has been living in the United States for 20 years, also said the potential phase-out of TPS disproportionately affects essential workers.
“The majority of us are essential workers risking our lives to do this work for the community,” she said. “If we are already risking our lives, exposing ourselves to the virus to keep the community safe, why can’t we do the same to protect ourselves?”
Monday’s ruling could leave hundreds of Harvard affiliates with uncertain futures, as the decision could allow for removal procedures to start as early as January 5, 2021.
Close to 200 Harvard affiliates are TPS recipients, according to Reina-Landaverde; there may be more, she said, but many—out of fear of jeopardizing their legal status—choose not to speak out.
In early 2017, the University hired immigration attorney Jason M. Corral to provide legal counsel to undocumented students. Corral is the only full-time attorney on campus charged with addressing immigration-related issues.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow has also lobbied congressional leaders on immigration, calling for “a pathway to citizenship” for TPS and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients.
But the administration’s efforts have been underwhelming, according to some Harvard TPS recipients.
“Regarding TPS, Mr. Bacow the only thing he’s done is go to Congress and talk about DACA and TPS and then did nothing else,” said Julio A. Perez, another custodial worker and TPS holder. “From him, I don’t expect anything, I expect more from the community.”
Bacow, in a written response to the Supreme Court’s June ruling on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, called on the United States Congress to act on immigration reform.
“Congress should now turn its attention to immigration reform and provide a pathway to citizenship for these young people and others, including individuals with temporary protected status,” Bacow wrote in a June email to Harvard affiliates.
Nonetheless, Perez mentioned that he was more optimistic about receiving support from Harvard students and those in the greater Cambridge area.
“I’ll tell you the truth, the support we receive from Harvard is from the community,” Perez said. “It’s from the workers, our bosses, our colleagues, the students, it’s that support that we count on.”

University of Michigan professor Susan M. Dynarski ’86 will join the faculty of the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a tenured professor of education on July 1, 2021, the Graduate School of Education announced Thursday.
Dynarski — who holds appointments as a professor of public policy, education, and economics at Michigan — researches problems and solutions to inequality and inequity in education. She regularly contributes to public education reform efforts as co-director of the University of Michigan’s Education Policy Initiative, which aims to research, teach, and disseminate best practices in education policy.
Dynarski grew up in Somerville — about a mile from Harvard Yard — she wrote in an email. She earned her undergraduate and master’s degrees at Harvard and started her career as a union organizer with the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers. Her academic career also began in Cambridge, as an assistant, then associate, professor at the Harvard Kennedy School until moving to Michigan in 2008.
Dynarski wrote that Cambridge and Harvard are her “home,” and she is ready to return after spending 12 years at Michigan.
“Now that my kids are off to college it’s time for a change,” she wrote. “I can’t imagine a better home than HGSE for launching this next stage of life.”
A first-generation college graduate, Dynarski wrote that her research is “deeply grounded” in her own experience.
“Small differences in the environment can make a huge difference for first-gen and low-income students,” she wrote. “I think my lived experience helps me to recognize barriers to their success, and design solutions.”
Dynarski maintains an active Twitter presence, where in recent months she has blasted the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in missives to her nearly 38,000 followers. She has also written op-eds for the New York Times, including one in August warning that the U.S. should focus on reopening K-12 schools rather than colleges.
“Research is useless if it sits unread in an academic journal,” Dynarski wrote in her email to The Crimson. “I use my platform on Twitter and the New York Times to get useful knowledge into the world.”
“I also use my platform to scream in frustration and post cute dog pics,” she added.
Dynarski’s work has been instrumental in understanding inequality in education, Harvard Graduate School of Education Dean Bridget Terry Long said in a press release.
“She has pushed the field to develop a more nuanced understanding of college access, financial aid design, labor market outcomes, and high school reforms,” Long said. “She has also been an extraordinary mentor to students and voice in important education debates.”

Harvard Graduate School of Education plans to pause its doctoral admissions for fall 2021 due to the financial strain the COVID-19 pandemic has placed on the school, according to its website.
Applications for students planning to enroll in fall 2021 would have been due in December 2020. According to the website, the school plans to next accept applicants in December 2021 for fall 2022 enrollment.
Students will still be able to apply for the Ed School’s master’s degree program.
The fall 2019 class of students had only 50 students enrolled in its two doctoral programs, the Doctor of Education Leadership and the Ph.D. By comparison, the class boasted 615 master’s students.
Ed School spokesperson Bari E. Walsh wrote in an emailed statement that the decision would not impact the school’s long-term commitment to doctoral students.
“Like every institution (at Harvard and beyond), HGSE has had to make tough decisions to manage the complex challenges that the pandemic has brought. But the proactive decision-making has put us on confident ground and helped us prioritize the highest quality learning experience and the continued academic progress of our students,” Walsh wrote.
“The school remains completely committed to the Ph.D. and Ed.L.D. Programs, having welcomed new cohorts in both programs this fall. Even with the one-year pause, HGSE will continue to serve an incredibly talented pool of students and help them grow into the types of leaders and scholars desperately needed by the field of education,” she added.
University spokesperson Jonathan A. Swain declined to comment on the decision.
Thomas D. Parker ’64 — a senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, who holds a masters and a doctorate from the Ed School — wrote in an email that the decision was “not surprising” in light of the school’s prior announcement that it will conduct classes online for the entire current academic year.
“Short term master's programs have always supported the doctoral programs at the Ed School. The one year Master's programs especially have generated a good number of full or nearly full payers and hence have been quite lucrative,” Parker wrote.
“Many of these full paying Master's students seek the cache of a year in Cambridge, and it wouldn't be surprising if large numbers of them decide not to pay for anything less than the full experience. It seems probable that applicants to the Master's programs are down and the resulting downturn in income means that there just isn't the cash to pay for financial aid to the doctoral students,” he added.
Parker wrote that though the Ed School would receive some funding from the endowment, “under current circumstances that is likely not enough to make up for lost Master's degree income.” He noted that the pandemic “magnified” the underlying financial problems facing the education school.
Harvard is not the only university suspending some doctoral admissions due to COVID-19 costs. The University of Pennsylvania announced Tuesday that its School of Arts and Sciences will likewise pause school-funded Ph.D. admissions for the 2021-2022 academic year.

Saeb Erekat, the Chief Palestinian Negotiator and Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, will join the Harvard Kennedy School’s Future of Diplomacy Project as a fellow for the 2020-2021 academic year.
Erekat has led Palestinian negotiations with Israel for decades. He was head of the Palestinian delegation at the Madrid Conference of 1991, and has served as Chief Negotiator during the Oslo Accords in 1993 and 1995, the Camp David Summit of 2000, and the negotiations at Taba in 2001.
His objective is to solve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with a two-state solution based on borders negotiated in 1967, according to a Kennedy School biography posted on the school’s website.
In a Tuesday statement to The Crimson, Shlomo Ben-Ami, former Israeli Foreign Minister and Minister of Security, wrote that Erekat “is a good man and an eloquent champion of the Palestinian cause.”
Ben-Ami served as the chief Israeli negotiator during the Camp David Summit and the negotiations in Taba, working opposite Erekat.
After recognizing his counterpart in a failed peace process, Ben-Ami said he believes Erekat “can offer students and faculty interesting insights on why Palestinian diplomacy failed in its central objective, reaching statehood and preventing the demotion of the Palestinian cause from being the epicenter of the region’s worries into its current status as a disposable item in the Arab regime’s priorities.”
Erekat has previously said that the peace deal among the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and Bahrain, signed Tuesday at the White House, was “an Arab dagger in [his] back.”
The agreement, the so-called Abraham Accords, entails new diplomatic and economic ties among the three countries.
The Abraham Accords, pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump and his son-in-law Jared C. Kushner ’03, fractured a long doctrine set by the Arab League that for years barred negotiations between the Arab states and Israel until Israel recognized the existence of a Palestinian state.
Erekat has said Trump is sending a political message with the deal and that the formation of an alliance is for Israel’s protection rather than for peace.
In his statement to The Crimson, Ben-Ami echoed Erekat’s past statements about the new agreement.
“Saeb is absolutely right to define Israel’s peace with the UAE and Bahrain as ‘peace for protection,’” Ben-Ami wrote.
Ben-Ami, however, maintained that the new peace deal, which he called a “sham state,” comes after the Palestinians rejected several peace offers.
“It is the serial Palestinian rejection of substantial peace offers that should explain why the Arab states today refuse to continue mortgaging their national interest to the Palestinian cause,” Ben-Ami wrote. “And today, the only peace deal that is on the table is the sham state offered by Trump’s peace plan.”
Erekat did not respond to a request for comment.
Erekat’s arrival to Harvard has not come without controversy. A Monday editorial from the New York Post claims that Harvard received a $2 million donation from the Palestinian Authority, which indirectly comes from American tax dollars through foreign aid.
Kennedy School spokesperson James F. Smith wrote in an emailed statement that the claims made by the New York Post were false.
“Harvard did not receive $2 million in donations from the Palestinian Authority,” Smith said. “The Kennedy School received a $150 000.00 gift from the Palestinian Monetary Authority in 2011 to establish an annual Graduate Public Service Fellowship to support a student from the occupied Palestinian territories for three years, through 2013.”
“The Kennedy School has received individual donations from Bashar Masri, a Palestinian businessman best known for building a major planned city in the West Bank,” he added. “These donations also fund fellowships for Palestinian students attending the School.”
StandWithUs, a nonpartisan Israeli education organization, also condemned Harvard’s decision to extend the fellowship to Erekat, citing his past statements as a Palestinian official against Israel. He once said he would “never recognize Israel as a Jewish state.”
Smith wrote the Kennedy School seeks to bring “diverse perspectives” to its campus. He noted that last year’s Fisher Family Fellow was Tzipi Livni, a former Israeli foreign minister.
“The Kennedy School is committed to bringing diverse perspectives to our community as part of our academic mission,” he wrote. “This fellowship appointment is consistent with that goal.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The former investment chief of Japan’s state pension fund pressured Harvard Management Company Chief Executive N.P. “Narv” Narvekar in a vote over the reappointment of an embattled electronics conglomerate chief executive, the Financial Times reported Tuesday.
In the lead-up to the company’s annual general meeting, Nobuaki Kurumatani, the chief executive of Toshiba, faced a contentious vote on his reappointment and pressure from activist shareholders unhappy with his leadership. Hiro Mizuno, former chief investment officer of the Government Pension Investment Fund and a Tesla board member, met with Narvekar in a virtual meeting in an attempt to sway his vote, according to the Financial Times.
Harvard — one of Toshiba’s largest investors — held a stake of approximately 4.5 percent in the technology company prior to the general meeting.
In the meeting, Mizuno referenced Toshiba’s connections to the Japanese government and the possibility that a vote against Kurumatani could impact HMC’s reputation, the Financial Times reported. Narvekar ultimately elected to abstain from the vote, and Kurumatani was reinstated with 58 percent support.
Singapore-based activist fund Effissimo, which holds a 10 percent stake in Toshiba, sent a survey to several other investors asking whether they had “voted in a manner inconsistent with intentions,” per the report.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment on the Financial Times’s report.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College released a form for reporting social distancing violations — complete with space for photos and videos — as part of a rollout of its disciplinary process for students in residence.
Before arriving on campus, students living in Harvard’s dorms signed a Community Compact affirming that they would abide by social distancing rules and other safety guidelines.
Though administrators have largely touted the success of students’ first weeks on campus and praised their adherence to College guidelines, recent reports of large social gatherings in house courtyards and along the Charles River have prompted sharp rebuke from administrators and other students.
The College also formed a Community Council — composed of an equal number of student volunteers, faculty, and staff members — to enforce the community compact and adjudicate alleged violations. Associate Dean of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct Brett Flehinger and the Special Advisor to the Harvard College Dean's Office related to COVID-19 Meghan Lockwood serve as co-chairs of the council.
In an email to undergraduates Tuesday, Flehinger and Lockwood announced the launch of the new Community Council section of the Dean of Students Office website, replete with the complete council procedures, a form used to report inquiries and complaints, and more.
The procedures outlined offer insight into the community council’s structure and inner workings — from a report to review to potential removal from campus. Here’s a primer on the process.
Council reviews begin with a report filed by a Harvard affiliate through the online reporting form.
The form requires the person filing a report to provide the date, the location, and a “detailed description” of the infraction in question. It also invites them to also submit any “supporting documentation” — such as a video or picture. The Council also requires reporting parties to add their name, and states that the subjects of investigations “will always have access to the same information that the Council reviews.”
“We do require a name, given that anonymous reports hamper our ability to respond effectively,” the form explains.
Once the council receives a report from an affiliate, the chair — or the community health lead — has two options. They can deliver an oral warning to the perpetrator of a “less significant offense,” or initiate a formal review.
“A review does not necessarily mean that the Residential Community Compact has been violated,” the procedures emphasize, however.
A College representative will notify any student implicated in the review and organize an initial meeting, during which they will receive a copy of the report filed against them in addition to any other case materials.
Students subjected to a review can’t discuss information they learn or share information they acquire throughout the process except with those “who have a need to know.” That group includes family members, mental health professionals, clergy, and legal counsel, in addition to their resident dean and their house’s community health lead. The student’s community health lead is intended to serve as a “source of support” throughout the review period.
Unless public health concerns call for an expedited process, the student must submit a written statement within 48 hours of their initial meeting in response to the report filed against them in order to provide context and information to “broaden” the Council’s understanding of the circumstances.
If the review involves more than one student, those implicated in a given incident may access “redacted” versions of their peers’ statements before formally meeting with the council, if they are requested to do so.
Stil, the procedures state that the College expects that students involved in the same case must write their own statements without conferring with each other. Students who do not comply with this expectation may face disciplinary action.
After reading the student’s statement and soliciting any other relevant information, the chair will decide whether the full council should review the student’s actions. If the chair directs the council to proceed, they will invite the student in for a meeting with a “team” of eight council members.
“Meeting with the Council is an opportunity for the student to explain the situation and to augment the initial statement,” the procedures state. “It will also be an opportunity for the members of the Council to ask questions and engage with the student on the concern that has been raised.”
After the meeting, the team will vote by simple majority on whether the student breached the community compact. If they vote in the affirmative, they will then decide what measures should be taken against the student.
Council reviews will have one of four outcomes: a no violation determination, a warning, “community responses” like education, and removal from housing. 
If the council is “sufficiently persuaded” a student violated the community compact, they will receive a formal warning letter.
The Council will assign “community responses” — an educational engagement as an alternative to removal from housing — if the body is sufficiently persuaded that a “serious violation” of the compact has occurred.
However, the Council may deem some offenses so serious that they would merit a more significant response for a single or first violation.
Students risk removal from the College’s residential housing for up to two semesters if the council finds that a student has committed a “serious” violation or a “series of repeated, less serious” violations of the compact. A student removed from housing may remain enrolled as an undergraduate and continue their Harvard-affiliated remote extracurricular activities.
In order to become eligible for residential housing after removal, a student must submit a statement to the council chair and the Dean of Students Katie G. O’Dair addressing the cause for their dismissal and suitability of their return to campus dorms. The Dean of Students Office will determine whether the student may return to residential housing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 3,600 attendees tuned into “Perfecters of This Democracy,” an hour-long webinar featuring the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole S. Hannah-Jones, Tuesday evening.
The Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study hosted Hannah-Jones as part of the presidential initiative on Harvard and the Legacy of Slavery, a University-wide effort to examine the legacy of slavery at Harvard. Dean of the Radcliffe Institute Tomiko Brown-Nagin, who leads the project, moderated Tuesday’s conversation.
During the event, Brown-Nagin and Hannah-Jones discussed Hannah-Jones’s 1619 Project — a series of essays in the New York Times Magazine highlighting the consequences of slavery and contributions of Black Americans.
The event title, “Perfecters of This Democracy,” referred to Hannah Jones’ framing essay from the project, in which she centered the role of Black Americans in shaping and “perfecting” American democracy.
“Black Americans have been one of the greatest gifts to this country because it has been through our constant resistance, that we actually have as much of a democracy as we can have,” Hannah-Jones said Tuesday.
Hannah-Jones also shared her thoughts on the relationship between journalism and history, possible reparations for descendants of slaves, interest convergence, and inequalities in the economic, educational, and healthcare systems.
In response to attendees’ questions on the possibility of dismantling those inequalities, Hannah-Jones said she has little hope for such change. She said slavery is embedded “in the DNA of the country.”
“What is possible and what is probable are clearly two different things. Can we? Of course we can. All of this inequality was constructed, so all of this inequality can be deconstructed,” Hannah-Jones said. “Is that probable? I don’t think so.”
Brown-Nagin also acknowledged how the country’s current racial climate could especially result in despair. Still, she offered a more hopeful sentiment in an email after the event.
“I have said in many contexts over the last several months that my own hope for a more just country—one that lives up to its promise of freedom and equality, regardless of race—rests on our capacity as individuals and as a society to engage thoughtfully and fearlessly with the questions confronting our nation,” Brown-Nagin wrote. “An event like this one, and work like Nikole’s, helps us to do that.”
Brown-Nagin said hosting Hannah-Jones reflects Radcliffe’s commitment to engaged scholarship and interdisciplinary, experiential learning. Launched last September, this mission — dubbed “Radcliffe Engaged” — has led the Institute to focus on topics including law, education, justice, health inequities, and police brutality.
Brown-Nagin wrote that she shares Hannah-Jones’ objective of confronting American history, which she said is integral to understanding and dismantling contemporary injustice.
“Together, we will examine our past, document and openly discuss the complex links between our University and slavery, and recommend a path forward,” she wrote. “There is a long and challenging road ahead, but this work is vital.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The City of Cambridge plans to keep its temporary emergency homeless shelter in operation for the next 20 months, though housing advocates say the city’s inability to expand the shelter’s capacity will leave more people sleeping outside this winter.
Cambridge first opened its emergency shelter at the War Memorial Recreation Center in April. Since then, the shelter has housed “about 60 individuals” on an average night, according to Cambridge Chief Public Health Officer Claude A. Jacob.
In the most recent annual count conducted by the Cambridge Continuum of Care — an affiliate of the city’s Department of Human Service Programs — there are about 555 people experiencing homelessness in the city.
In addition to opening the shelter, Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff said the city has also taken over funding to support daytime shelters as well as implemented more outreach efforts and case management for the homeless community.
“This has been a really strong city commitment, and I think the results speak for themselves. Everyone has really made this a priority and it's been a successful one,” Cambridge City Manager Louis A. DePasquale said.
Reverend Kate Layzer — Minister of Street Outreach at First Church Cambridge and a member of the Unhoused Advocacy Subcommittee of the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition — said she is concerned whether people experiencing homelessness will have access to shelter this winter.
“Now, I do want to say they’ve done a lot. They spent close to half a million dollars just on buying restaurant meals to try to make up for all of the community meals that closed down with COVID,” Layzer said. “But we are very concerned about the winter.”
In particular, Layzer pointed to the city’s decision not to “add anybody new” as a primary cause for concern. The shelter will remain only available to those who are already in the city’s computer records for existing public services, like the Cambridge and Somerville Programs for Addiction Recovery and the Cambridge Warming Center.
“The big problem is the numbers that they're providing emergency housing is far less than what we need to take people who are now on the streets because the shelters are closed,” said Alice E. Kidder, another member of the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, many Cambridge shelters have had to reduce their capacity or even shut down. The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which is run by undergraduates, closed its doors in March and will not reopen this fall.
The city does not anticipate opening any additional shelters, according to Semonoff.
“The public health guidelines are to try and bring people inside and give them stability. That's the classic ‘housing first’ model, which Cambridge says that it embraces. But it does seem as if what's happening in actual practice is that people who already have some measure of stability are being given favorite treatment,” Layzer said.
The city shelter will be relocated to the nearby Spaulding Hospital around November, according to DePasquale. Guests and Bay Cove Human Services staff at the War Memorial will move to the two floors of the hospital’s east building, which is currently undergoing construction to make the space into a shelter.
“We believe our maximum capacity at Spaulding will be 57, which is lower than our capacity at the War Memorial but about what we see on an average night at the War Memorial,” Jacob said.
Layzer said the shortage of shelter housing in Cambridge caused by the pandemic remains an unaddressed issue for the city, given private shelters’ reduced capacity and the city shelter’s inability to accommodate new people.
“As great as my concerns about COVID, and I am right there with everybody else about it, you can also die of freezing to death — that's another way to die,” she said.
Layzer and Kidder said their immediate priority is to provide Cambridge’s homeless community with winter essentials in anticipation of the lack of shelter space.
“We're trying to give out sleeping bags that are high enough quality to help the situation, but this really isn't the way we should be treating people,” Kidder said.

Let’s be real: even for the most well-prepared students, the coronavirus has thrown a wrench into all of our plans. Along with summer travel plans and on-campus classes, COVID-19 has even taken out in-person research — restrictions are so tough that even the most hardcore pre-meds can’t get into a physical lab. Even though you envision test tubes and beakers when you think of a lab, there are plenty of remote research opportunities available at Harvard. If you’re looking to get involved in a lab or work for a professor, check out ways you can maximize your remote research experience below!
LinkedIn Learning
Who knew every Harvard student’s favorite social media site could be so useful? LinkedIn Learning is a free platform that offers over 15,000 on-demand courses to learn valuable skills such as Python for data science, R, Excel, market data analysis, and more. Hopefully you learn something new, but at worst, you’ll be able to brag about it to your 300+ connections.
BioRender
For the artistically challenged, BioRender is the perfect tool to create beautiful figures for your research projects or when you’re just feeling bored during class. Tried and true Flyby hack: try to make your professor’s face out of the provided icons when you’re bored during lecture.
Ask a Librarian
Our favorite and often most underutilized resources! The Harvard librarians have set up a live chat option operating from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., or just submit a question over email.
Library Shenanigans
No, we are not referring to the stacks. To use the libraries ~properly~, check out the research guides that are fit for a variety of disciplines, digital library collections that allow you to study over six million digital objects, and Lean Library, a browser extension that gives you access to digital content available through Hollis.
If you’re struggling with remote research, we feel you! Even though this is a new challenge, hopefully Flyby has equipped you with the tools you need to get started. And if not, don’t worry — your Nobel will still be waiting for you.
Sections
Looking to get competitive during your next club social or call with friends? Look no further — Flyby’s rounded up some multiplayer games perfect for trying out during your next Zoom call. You and your friends may be scattered across different time zones and worried about catching coronavirus, but at least these games are here to help you catch up and stay sane.
Skribbl.io
2-12 players
If you haven’t played Skribbl.io yet, you’ve been missing out! Make a private room and get a bunch of your friends to join. You’ll take turns getting a word and drawing a picture for it, guessing what your friends’ drawings are supposed to be, and laughing a lot when the drawings are, uh, bad. There’s also support for custom words, so you can build your own deck of words to draw from.
Among Us
4-10 players
To play Among Us for free, everyone will need to download the app on a phone or tablet. The premise is that all players are a team completing tasks to run a spaceship. One player, however, is actually an Imposter whose goal is to ruin the mission. While everyone runs around doing tasks, the Imposter will kill crewmates, sabotage ship technology, and try to keep their identity hidden. Crew members are tasked with keeping the ship running and figuring out who the Imposter is before it’s too late.
Set with Friends
1+ players
This is a beautiful web app for playing the classic card game Set, and one of its developers is Harvard’s very own Eric K. Zhang ’23. In Set, cards display groups of shapes that may come in different numbers or colors. You compete to be the quickest to find triplets of cards satisfying certain rules. This may sound vague, but once you get into it, it’s hard to stop playing!
Enigma
4+ players
Players are split into two opposing spy teams. Each team has four keywords they use to send encrypted messages for their teammates to decode, but beware — the other team can see your encrypted messages, too. As the rounds go by, see if you can use the enemy team’s previous messages to crack the code and figure out what their next one might say.
Drawphone 
4+ players
Drawphone is like Telephone, but with pictures. The game will give you all the instructions you need, so don’t worry if you haven’t played before, but the idea is that everyone starts out by making a drawing with a caption. After that, you’ll go back and forth getting drawings with no captions (and guessing what the caption should be) and captions with no drawings (and making a new drawing for it). Drawphone isn’t competitive; the goal is to just have fun! This game is best when played with very imaginative friends.
All games have an option to play in a private room with only people you’ve invited, but if you feel like making new friends, many have opportunities to play with strangers in public rooms, too. Online games may not be the same as hanging out in person, but they definitely make the wait for the pandemic to end more bearable. Have fun!
