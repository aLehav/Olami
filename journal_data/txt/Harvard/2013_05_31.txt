After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Addressing thousands of new graduates and their supporters in Tercentenary Theatre, University President Drew G. Faust argued Thursday afternoon that research spending cuts stemming from sequestration threaten Harvard’s ability to mount an effective intellectual response to crises like those experienced this year. Faust said that as a result of the cuts Harvard stands to lose as much as $40 million in federal funding annually—about six percent of what the University received from the federal government in fiscal year 2012.
Striking a somber tone on an otherwise celebratory day, Faust maintained that Harvard not only plays a role in facilitating important conversations in the aftermath of tragedies and disasters, but also plays a foundational role in researching solutions to climate change and physical injury, among other issues.
“Our broader and ongoing responsibility as a university is to ask and address the larger questions any such tragedy poses: to prepare for the next crisis and the one after that, even as we work to prevent them; to help us all understand the origins and the meaning of such terrible events,” Faust said. “We do this work in the teaching and research to which we devote ourselves every day.”
But Faust said that work is put at risk by the already apparent effects of the sequester. Just three months after the failure of legislation that would have stopped the across-the-board cuts to federal discretionary spending known as sequestration, Faust said, fewer and fewer research grant applications are being approved for funding, and even existing awards are being scaled back.
Faust has been vocal this year about the potentially harmful effects of the sequester. In February, she gave a speech before the American Association for the Advancement of Science in which she called sequestration a threat to “intellectual life,” and then traveled to Washington, D.C., in February to petition lawmakers to stop the cuts. But Thursday’s speech, delivered at the afternoon exercises of the University’s Commencement, was her most public warning against sequestration to date.
On Thursday, Faust framed her speech around three disruptive events which each caused the University to close its doors this year—Hurricane Sandy in October, the February blizzard dubbed “Nemo,” and the Boston Marathon bombings and their fallout in April. Prior to this academic year, Faust noted, Harvard had not canceled class since a historic 1978 blizzard.
“These three unusual days underscore and illuminate the usual work of this University: calling on knowledge and research to address fundamental challenges and dilemmas with resources drawn from the widest scope of human inquiry,” Faust said.
In closing, Faust urged political actors and Harvard alumni to help find a less turbulent solution to America’s budget deficit.
“The challenges facing the world are too consequential, the need for knowledge, imagination and understanding is too great, the opportunity for improving the human condition too precious for us to do anything less than rise to the occasion,” she said.
Faust’s approximately 15-minute speech preceded remarks by Oprah Winfrey, the media mogul and philanthropist.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Oprah Winfrey, the media mogul and philanthropist of international fame, urged the University’s newest graduates to embrace setbacks as an opportunity for growth in her Commencement speech in Tercentenary Theatre Thursday afternoon.
“At some point, you are bound to stumble,” she told the crowd of thousands of graduating students and their friends and families. “You will at some point fall, and when you do, I want you to remember this—There is no such thing as failure; failure is just life trying to move us in another direction.”
At times humorous and at others more serious, Winfrey began her 30-minute speech with a tongue-in-cheek reference to residential life at Harvard College.
“I’m going to address my remarks to anybody who has ever felt inferior or felt disadvantaged or felt screwed by life,” Winfrey began her remarks, jokingly adding, “This is a speech for the Quad.”
In a self-deprecating anecdote, Winfrey reflected on a moment of failure in her own life.
In mid-2012, around the time that University President Drew G. Faust called to suggest that Winfrey might come to speak at Harvard’s Commencement ceremonies, Winfrey was enduring what she called “the worst period in my professional life.”
Her newest television venture, the Oprah Winfrey Network, was struggling to make headway in the national media market, and had been dubbed a failure by a number of commentators.
In this moment of professional crisis, Winfrey recalled thinking: “What could I possibly say to Harvard graduates, some of the most successful graduates in the world, in the very moment when I had stopped succeeding?”
Despite her doubts, Winfrey accepted the speaking invitation from Faust, and subsequently saw the OWN network grow significantly in the last year.
For her, the temporary setback reignited a passion to succeed.
“Here’s the key,” she told the graduates. “Learn from every mistake, because every experience and encounter, particularly your mistakes, are there to teach you and force you into being more of who you are.”
In the latter part of her speech, Winfrey also addressed philanthropy, describing how, in the 1990s, she led her viewers in a spare-change donation initiative that collected over $3 million for a college scholarship fund.
She urged graduates to seek out opportunities to serve others in their careers and personal lives.
“Each of you has been blessed with this enormous opportunity of attending this prestigious school. You now have a chance to better your life, the lives of your neighbors, and also the life of our country,” Winfrey said. “When you do that, let me tell you what I know for sure: that’s when your story gets really good.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Scott.
Scott loved playing sports, but the problem was that he wasn’t a very  good athlete. Thin, boney, and nerdy, he had the height of a stunted  rabbit, the speed of an intoxicated turtle, and the strength of an  arthritic mouse. His greatest athletic accomplishment was either hitting  a triple in Little League—and really, let’s be honest, it was a bloop  single with two errors—or earning the fifth-doubles spot on a middle  school tennis team that everybody made. Oh, and one time he scored like  eight points in the D-Level Booster Basketball “All-Star” Game against a  maladroit collection of obese middle schoolers. That was pretty cool.
Anyway, with a smaller chance at the pros than a man has of winning  the lottery and being struck by lightning on the same day, Scott  redirected his interest in the only manner he possibly could—by devoting  all of his energy into being a fan.
Hours were spent listening to games on a radio hidden under his  pillow after his parents had sent him to sleep, filling countless marble  notebooks with imaginary trade proposals, and watching SportsCenter  reruns on mornings when his peers were enjoying cartoons. To Scott,  sports was more than a passion; it was an obsession.
As all children do, our protagonist soon grew up and became a young  man, and come 2009 it was time for him choose a college. It should not  surprise you, dear reader, that Scott wished to attend a big sports  school.
Perhaps he would join the 100,000 fans that packed the Big House  every Saturday at Michigan. Or possibly he would become a Cameron Crazy  at Duke and paint his chest blue come November. Or maybe he would go to  Stanford, who had a young quarterback destined to be a superstar.
Then one day, a surprise arrived in our protagonist’s mailbox—it was a  letter, and it stated that he had been accepted to Harvard University.  Harvard! The notice offered the possibility of an unparalleled academic  opportunity, but also an experience quite distinct from the one that had  been dominating his chimerical imagination. Certainly, he believed,  people at Harvard must be far too erudite, far too focused on pursuits  ranging from quantum physics to quixotic philosophy to care about  something as trivial as sports.
What was our dear protagonist to do?
Well, as you know, good reader, Scott chose to attend Harvard, but  not without a great deal of concern. He worried whether he would meet  other people like him. People who comprehended what it meant to invest  so much of one’s emotional energy into the successes of a group of  millionaires, who recognized that the common bond among fans could unite  strangers like nothing else could, who knew that the understanding that  in sports there was always a tomorrow was the most calming feeling in  the world.
Upon arriving in Cambridge, Scott decided to comp the sports board of  The Harvard Crimson, an organization that he believed would give him  the best chance to meet such people. And guess what? He did!
Over the next four years, joining the newspaper would become far and  away the best decision Scott made during his undergraduate career. It  gave him the opportunity to cover the storied Harvard-Yale Game, the  Beanpot at TD Garden, and a contest at Fenway Park. He got to tell  stories of champions of a century ago, of athletes following in the  illustrious legacies of their parents, and of those alumni who had made  the rare leap from Harvard to the pros. He got to learn and teach and  laugh and make friendships that he hopes will last a lifetime.
And as he did so, Scott realized something that would surprise many  around the country, including the apprehensive high school version of  himself.
He did not need Michigan, or Duke, or Stanford, because Harvard was a sports school.
One in which a full quarter of the student body was a member of one  of Harvard’s nation-high 41 varsity athletic teams. One in which the  football; wrestling; sailing; men’s basketball, soccer, swimming,  tennis, and vollyball; and men’s and women’s heavyweight and lightweight  crew, fencing, hockey, lacrosse, and squash programs that those  students were a part of could all at one point or another be found in  the Top 25 of their respective rankings during his four years at the  College—that’s 20 squads, for all you Yale folk, or more than most  schools have total teams.
Scott came to see that Harvard was a sports school most strongly in  the cramped, aging, undersized gymnasium they call Lavietes Pavilion,  where on three cold winter weekends 400 undergraduates became the  “Cambridge Crazies” he had written in his Harvard application essay he  had wanted to help establish. Students who loudly hooted at refs and  hollered at opponents and believed that their team would win. And, very  often, the Crimson responded by doing so.
Indeed, it was one of the best stories he had ever heard from the  world of sports, a true rags-to-riches tale that he co-wrote 7,500 words  on if you’d like to learn more. The team’s success gave him the chance  to cover important home games alongside the legendary Bob Ryan and  provided him with the most incredible experience of his four collegiate  years—the opportunity to cover not one, but two(!) NCAA tournament games  at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City this past March.
As a college basketball zealot, our protagonist simply could not have  chosen a better four-year block out of Harvard’s 337-year existence to  attend the College. History was made, championships were won, Linsanity  ensued, unforgettable memories were created, and through it all,  students genuinely, passionately cared.
Yes, despite his initial hesitations, Scott had gotten the chance to attend a sports school. But did he live happily ever after?
That, like his incredible Little League triple, is entirely up in the air.
