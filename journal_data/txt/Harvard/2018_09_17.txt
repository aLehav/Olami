After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I firmly believe that the greatest eulogies are love songs. Endings force reckonings—it is often when we put something to rest that we truly come to appreciate it. For Detroit-raised Quinn XCII, playing to a packed crowd in the heart of the Midwest at this inflection point in his career must have held a certain and special poignance. His Sunday evening set was a tribute to his roots, a send-off to the precipice of greater heights.
What we saw that evening was an adolescent dream actualized. As he wrapped up the gradual, undulating build that was opening number “Candle,” Quinn declared to the crowd that Lollapalooza was the only festival that he had wanted to perform at. As a long time festival-goer, he was now at Grant Park for the first time as a performer. It was particularly fitting, then, that his next song was “Full Circle.”
Watching this performance, one would have no idea it was his first gig at this festival. Quinn held tight control of the stage without relying on any stunts, instead opting for a humble, homey experience. He stayed close to his mic for the most part, though occasionally broke up the monotony by pacing around stage (exercise which elicited a confession that he should probably do more cardio). He allowed his vocals to carry the show, scream-singing in “Fake Denim” and engaging in a playful back-and-forth with the keyboard in “Worst.” As the show progressed, it became clear that Quinn was mature, self-aware, and introspective.
It is telling how, at this swift upswing in Quinn’s career, imagery of home still permeates his songs about love. Some of it is explicit: “Another Day In Paradise” grasps at carefree nighttime hijinks in one’s hometown, while “Kings of Summer” relies on a house porch as its central setting. Others, such as short descriptions of using his dad’s keys and wielding flare guns, sneak in less announced. These memories are rosy but fleeting, tinged with a fundamental bittersweetness.
When I say that Quinn XCII’s set was the swan song of the heartland, I’m not just referring to the Midwest. Though he dedicated multiple tracks to the beloved flyover country, the heartland is a colloidal collection of driveways and cornfields and lake houses—images displayed on a reel behind the sound system—suspended in impetuosity and boundless imagination. When we leave our hometowns, we can always drive or fly back. What we cannot traverse, however, is the chasm created by time, by the feeling that we have grown beyond the worlds which once housed us. As I stood swaying to the music, a pack of fraternity members to my left and a couple of starry-eyed high school graduates to my right, I was struck by how quickly the places we frequent become foreign to us. After his performance, Lollapalooza-attendee-turned-performer Quinn XCII might’ve felt the same way.
This feeling culminated in his closing number “Straightjacket,” a tune more morose than the typical concert ending. As Quinn sings to his Midwestern ex-girlfriend, “You won’t know me when the feeling’s all gone.” And what a fitting choice that was, ending a set plastered with memories of one’s hometown with a song about moving on from love. You’d be hard pressed to find a quainter ending to Quinn’s performance.
Like all great eulogies, Sunday night’s performance was a celebration and a farewell. Gathering together in the grassy backyard of American Eagle, listeners were struck by the knowledge that we might never see the singer so intimately, so fundamentally ours, again. As the set winded down, Quinn XCII set our paper lampion stage alight, a quintessentially Midwestern tradition, leaving us first burning, then flickering, with the ephemera of a single candlewick. When he was finished, he cast us adrift into the night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

If we are to understand the music industry as a feudal system of strongmen and loyal followers, then queendom Minaj is under siege. It has been four years since Nicki Minaj has put out a proper album, and time has not been kind to her. Embroiled in a slew of controversies and faced by adversaries old and new, the musician has been disappointingly unsuccessful in responding by either public statement or rap feature. Thankfully, her new album “Queen” is levelheaded, tempered with the maturity that develops from guarding your position on top. However, the collection of tracks is its own war of attrition: able to hold its own and not devoid of victories, but laborious nonetheless.
As an established act, it seems like Nicki Minaj has finally realized she does not need to grandstand. Opening track “Ganja Burns,” is not at all a triumphant return track. Instead, there’s a spiritual, restorative quality to it. Wispy and smoke-like, the piece has a charmingly subdued guitar motif in the background that seems to blink in and out of existence (a Nicki mirage of sorts). The feeling carries on into the bouncy “Majesty,” featuring big names Eminem and Labrinth. Rather than heavy-handedly gassing each other up like one might expect, the artists create a high energy love song, as if unbothered by the outside world—Minaj’s only comment to detractors is the repeated “Jealousy is a disease, die slow.” With that, she joins the pantheon of giants who realize that the best defense is not offense, but indifference.
If Minaj is going to be made out to be a villain, it will be on her own terms. “Barbie Dreams,” a new take on “Just Playing (Dreams)” by The Notorious B.I.G., manages to pull off a good faith onslaught of her rap contemporaries. Funky, referential, and made possible by genuine industry friendships, the song demonstrates that good digs are good digs, regardless of whether they have malice behind them. Though she does get in a few disses later on in the album, the pivot away from the relentlessly acerbic is invigorating at a time when the media is insistent on pitting female rappers against one another.
This faux-“evil” Nicki comes to a head in the Chun phase of the album. Minaj has been heavily criticized for cultural appropriation in her single “Chun Li,” where she declares, “They paintin’ me out to be the bad guy / Well it’s the last time you’re gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me.” Self-aware and backed up by hard bars, the track and persona offer a burst of energy before the album begins to drag. What’s unfortunate, however, is that she leans too far into the whole Chun image. “Chun Swae,” featuring Swae Lee in an act of title-play that feels a bit on the nose, really does not do its counterpart justice. Papered with weird production, pitched up vocals, and an outro that drags the song past six minutes long, it makes one wonder what part of the Chun essence she wanted to capture.
There is a difference between being self-assured and self-indulgent, and the album at times clearly lapses into the latter. It is a fact of nature: 19-song albums face an entropic drive towards tedium. And while some might argue that a four-year hiatus should be justification enough to showcase a larger selection of work, many of the choices in the album don’t hold up. The outros of songs, for example, often do nothing to add to them: “Rich Sex,” which was already feeling a tad vapid and trend-chasing (compounded by Lil Wayne’s whiny contributions), sinks further as Nicki asks “You mad, doggie?” in its final moments. The “2 Lit 2 Late Interlude,” a repetitive structural track which only exists to gel the album together, leaves listeners restless rather than refreshed.
Moving through the album feels like moving through brackish water: potent, then muddled and dilute. Songs such as “Thought I Knew You,” “Run and Hide,” and “Come See About Me” are mostly or completely sung, and while Nicki’s voice is not unpleasant, it is incapable of bringing the edge that her rapping does. While her attempt to open up and be sentimental is appreciated, one can’t help but wonder if a stripped, confessional-style rap flow might have better conveyed the love and heartbreak unsuccessfully packaged in those tracks. Hearing the marimba-backed spitting of “LLC” and the throwback-Roman pickup at the end of “Barbie Dreams,” the overabundance of sedated singing feels like squandered real estate. At the very least, the decreased reliance on a recurring pop hook would have tightened the album.
It is perplexing why Nicki does not play more to her strengths. While lengthy albums have become her modus operandi, the identity crisis in this one is particularly sophomoric. “Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded” threw everything at the wall to see what stuck. “The Pinkprint” stretched itself out with mostly unearned sentimentality. “Queen,” a supposed answer to that, masqueraded itself behind sick bars and backslid. There’s nothing inherently wrong with a bulky record, but smothering a great project with “Pinkprint” B-sides is unforgivable. And most frustrating of all is the fact that Nicki seems to at least peripherally understand this: In “LLC,” she near-pejoratively writes that “It’s two girls getting more money, and they don’t rap, they sing songs.” So give us strained metaphors. Give us shameless name-dropping. Don’t give us melancholic head voice. We already have the Billboard Top 100 for that.
After an aimless midsection, Nicki closes strong with “Coco Chanel.” Joined by Foxy Brown, Nicki returns to her New York roots, ending the album with swagger. The feature is a great foil to Nicki, providing thudding rap delivery that plays well against her partner’s swaying sound. Hearing this track, I get the sense that this album would have been just as appropriately titled “Queens.” Nicki has demonstrated that she can hold her own in both the rap landscape and share spotlight without losing stature. Moreover, she has not lost the crisp flows and New York attitude which earned her a following. Yes, the album is long and unwieldy at times. But all who hope to witness a de-crowning are going to have to keep waiting. As Nicki so knowingly reminds us, those who covet die slow.

If Arctic Monkeys headlined Thursday from a crossroads, Bruno Mars led Friday’s lineup from a very different vantage point. Deservedly or not, Mars swept the major Grammys with “24K Magic,” taking home six of six possible awards, and has somehow already performed at two Super Bowl halftime shows. Accordingly, his 90-minute show admitted no ambiguities or hesitations. Mars is at the top of his game—of the pop world in general—and he knows it.
Nearly every beat of what was nearly an uninterrupted parade of Top 40 hits appeared choreographed: Mars’ band, whom he introduced as the “hardest-working band in show business” (he’s never been shy about his influences), joined him for tight line-dance grooves even as they played (or appeared to play) bass and saxophone. If this might have resulted in a mechanical and impersonal-feeling performance, Mars compensated with a warmth and charisma that poured off of his frame onto the stage and halfway across Grant Park from the opening “Finesse.”
Mars’ stage was truly headliner-scale, with additional screens above the stage supplementing the Lolla-provided jumbotrons on either side. Diverging from the previous night’s headliners, whose unadorned black-and-white video feed contributed to their cool detachment, Mars varied the visuals, spelling out the lyrics on “Chunky” and flooding the projection with colorful, abstract shapes on “That’s What I Like” and “Locked Out of Heaven.” Ever the crowd-pleaser, Mars and band wore Bulls jerseys, with the frontman donning Scottie Pippen’s #33 Fireworks launched at climactic moments throughout.
Mars put a wide range of talents on display—not only singing and dancing but also soloing on a (gold, naturally) Stratocaster on “Calling All My Lovelies.” Without a guitar, he played the enormous crowd as an instrument: When he prompted a dance-off between the right and left sides of the audience, the ground shook—literally. The only low point occurred with Mars off the stage. Perhaps to give him a break, his keyboardist, John Fossit, played an impressive but bizarrely long keyboard interlude. Given the relative brevity of Mars’s time slot at 90 minutes (and 14 songs), Fossit’s recital so bewildered some attendees that they began leaving the grounds. 
After leading the crowd in a grand-finale “Just the Way You Are,” Mars left the stage, but he rewarded fans’ faith in an encore of “Uptown Funk,” quite possibly the song of the decade. As Mars vocally stylized over the “don’t believe me, just watch” refrain, his corner of Lollapalooza felt like the center of the musical universe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Some people are scared of snakes. Others quake when faced with heights and twenty-story buildings. But my fear falls along the socioeconomic ladder: I’m scared of rich people.
I won’t cross a the street when I see a trust fund kid. I might avoid eye contact, but I’m not classist. In fact, I quite like rich people. They’re the reason I get to go here (thank you, financial aid donors!). It’s just that the sight and aura of the monied class sets my mind into overthinking mode, self-consciousness into overdrive, and robs my tongue of the ability to communicate.
I’m not scared of being defrauded of millions of dollars in a Ponzi scheme. White-collar crime doesn’t rob me of my sleep. I just worry that rich people smell my working class roots, hear my lack of boarding school training, see my discount-store garb, and think I’m inferior.
Let’s take the first time I met my freshman year roommate. After a week of pre-orientation, piles of dirty laundry meant the only clean clothes I had were the least impressive ones, a cotton tank top and shorts. In a tender time when all we freshmen were sizing each other up, presentation mattered. Her family must have known that, because they signaled their entry into our dorm by singing “Hiiii!” in the coordinated way only years of singing lessons can provide. A socioeconomic analyst, I scanned their camping equipment, dad’s crisp button-down shirt, and mom’s pristine pearl necklace. The signs were as clear as charges pressed in a white-collar crime; they had money. And I didn’t.
You might be thinking, "So what?" Time and time again, we’re told we all belong at Harvard. It doesn’t matter where you came from, you’re here now! We all have access to the same resources and opportunities. College is supposed to be the great equalizer, and a Harvard education should be the ultimate social mobility catapult for low-income students.
But empty rhetoric doesn’t change that we live in a world of haves and have-nots. We might take the same classes and sweat in the same un-air conditioned rooms, but elite educational institutions amplify rather than alleviate the advantages of an upper class upbringing. Our culture privileges the speech, know-how, and life experiences of higher income students since Ivy League institutions were built for them. Currently, our university lacks the structural supports to counteract our class differentials. Skipper’s boarding school doesn’t go away when he’s shooting the breeze with some powerful old Ivy League alums and I don’t understand what a Nantucket is or the other half of what they’re talking about. When the rich kids around you have cultural capital and knowledge that brings friendship, extracurricular and academic opportunities, and even just an ease of existing in a place like Harvard, it’s hard not to feel like money’s the only thing you’re lacking.
Talking about money is shameful, and not having money is even more shameful. Within other social categories, like race and gender, we take pride and build identities around categorizations that structurally disadvantage us. We can join groups that champion womanhood; we can walk around with afros on our heads and black pride in our hearts. But you won’t see us in t-shirts proclaiming “The future is financially unstable” or with raised fists cheering “Poor and Proud.” Class is an identity to be shed or forgotten as one’s material conditions change and one achieves success. We find that there’s beauty in the struggle of learning to embrace being black, a woman, and a host of other identities. But being poor is only empowering once we’ve made it to the other side of the income bracket.
Experience tells me that growing up without money builds character. Some might say being poor isn’t so bad. Of course, there’s the whole wondering how bills will get paid and whether the lights will get turned off and maybe even thoughts of where the next meal might come from (the effects of which can create lifelong effects on one’s mental and physical wellbeing.) But that’s a point for another column.
I’m not ashamed of where I come from. I’m grateful for every aspect of growing up how I did, for I wouldn’t be who I am today without those experiences. Receiving scholarships and financial aid since beginning high school has provided me with academic, travel, leisure, and internship opportunities that most people from lower income backgrounds don’t even know are possible to dream of.
The point of discussing my economic anxiety is that living among the haves as a have-not in a socioeconomically stratified society is weird. Most of us don’t have the opportunity to interact with people outside our class. And when you do, you learn rich people take trips to Europe for a weekend on a whim and don’t know how to use a broom properly. They’ll talk about upper-class activities and leave you struggling to process their reality and and scrambling for a response.
This is not a call for rich people to go into hiding. One of the greatest acts of bravery I’ve ever witnessed occurred when a friend admitted that both of his parents earn six figure salaries. A coming out story for the ages.
I ask not for guilt, but more frequent and honest discussions about how class informs the things we like, the ways we speak, and the fears within us. Instead of wallowing in shame or apologizing for how we grew up, we should take action to make spaces on campus more inclusive. We can build our clubs, run our classrooms, and even conduct our social lives such that success or belonging depend not on socioeconomic-dependent experiences and knowledge.
For now, I’ll continue to do my best to manage my phobia. Unfortunately, as it now stands, there are no meds on the market for discomfort around wealth.

He was the “man for the moment.”
Last year, we wrote that we were “optimistic” about the presidential search committee’s selection of Lawrence S. Bacow as Harvard’s 29th president. Now, Bacow has been on the job for almost two months. While two months gives us limited data points, we must reflect on whether this optimism was well-placed.
Given that Bacow assumed his presidential duties on July 1, it is too soon to form a comprehensive opinion on his role and achievements. Nevertheless, we are enthusiastic about Bacow’s presidency so far. He has engaged with the student body energetically. For example, not only did he help first-year students move in, but he also talked to first-generation students participating in the First-Year Retreat and Experience. This pattern of investment in College life mirrors his reputation for actively interacting with undergraduates while president of Tufts University. This type of engagement is demonstrative of a break from Bacow’s predecessors, many of whom failed to engage on a meaningful basis with undergraduates in their tenures. Bacow’s strong interest in learning more about the student body’s diverse experiences and passions sets a promising tone for his presidency.
Bacow has ascended to the presidency at a critical time in Harvard’s history. From the admissions lawsuit against Harvard currently threatening affirmative action to a lagging endowment and large endowment tax on the horizon, Harvard is facing a potentially tumultuous year. Bacow’s lobbying efforts for Harvard this year — including signing a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency — should be especially appreciated by the student body and the rest of the administration. We can only hope that he will continue to be as engaged and decisive a community leader as he has thus far been.
Nevertheless, we still see areas for improvements. Most concretely, we encourage Bacow to send an official welcome email to Harvard’s student body, much like Dean Khurana has done at the beginning of each year. This would allow Bacow to introduce himself to the Harvard student body. We would encourage him to use this email to update the student body on pressing issues that are relevant to the University, including the admissions lawsuit. Now is the time for clarity, transparency, and openness —  Bacow’s first months suggest he will be a strong community leader, and we hope this translates to his work on such controversial issues.
It is early in Bacow’s tenure, and there are many triumphs and tribulations to come — a presidency cannot and should not be judged on two months of work. Yet we remain optimistic for the future of Harvard under Bacow’s leadership, and are eager to see how he will shape the University in the years ahead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was this brief period of time where I was obsessed with the idea of overdosing on Ibuprofen.
I mean, when you’re depressed, what better way is there to go? In theory, it would be quite literally a painless death. And when everyday feels like washing an open wound, the promise of sedation is far more thrilling than promises of happiness in an unseeable future.
But as I found out in the middle of a suicidal crisis, you would throw up the pills long before you could consume lethal levels. Even if you managed to hold some of it down, the worst you could really do to yourself was permanent liver damage (which is far less appealing).
After telling my counselor about this experience with perhaps the same sense of remove and fascination, I was unceremoniously told that it was “highly recommended” that I meet with a psychiatrist to explore the possibility of antidepressants. Despite my counselor’s professional calm, it was clear that he was far more scared than I was about the situation. Before I could even process what my thoughtless “sure, I guess” meant, the phone call had been made and the appointment scheduled.
Even today, I still find it an absolute miracle that I had agreed to start medication.
I had always been absolutely opposed to the idea, morally equating the use of antidepressants with the use alcohol or other substances to sedate oneself. After all, antidepressants were practically made to work like “legalized cocaine” — forcefully inducing a stagnant high that would last throughout the day. Sure, it’d be “the easy way out” of my misery; it’d also do nothing to the virus eating me alive, as useless and as bad for your liver as Ibuprofen.
Thinking back, I now realize this revulsion to the “fakeness” of antidepressants came from a strange conviction that my depression was somehow my fault. I was convinced that I had a serious problem, and that I had a moral responsibility to fix this problem the hard way. It didn’t matter that failure meant suicide, that my life was spiraling out of control, or that my depression could have been simply biological. I was stubborn.
But I was also tired. At this point, I had been unable to do any readings for two whole months; my teachers were becoming increasingly disappointed with my absences; my counselor was threatening not to approve my health clearance form for study abroad if I didn’t comply; and, most importantly, I knew counseling wasn’t working for me. So, with a strength that was not my own, I resisted the urge to “accidentally miss” my appointment, forced myself through the November cold and into the gray of the Smith Center, put on a polite smile, and carefully described the symptoms that were killing me.
I came away from that psychiatrist meeting with a prescription for Bupropion — a bright blue tablet that typically treats nicotine addictions but is sometimes prescribed for seasonal depression as well. According to my psychiatrist, it would be everything I needed: excitement, focus, motivation, even stress-control. Yet, I was repeatedly warned that I was also putting myself at risk for seizures, had to watch my alcohol intake, would experience exacerbated insomnia, and that I would suffer “mild” side effects for the first two weeks.
Those side effects were anything but “mild.” The first few days, my heart raced so fast it felt like a constant anxiety attack. My breathing was so shallow I had to make myself take box-breaths while forcing my way through some Aristotle. Headaches were a constant fixture that made me irate and miserable. I couldn’t stop fidgeting while talking to other people.
But for the first time in months, I could finally get out of bed. Sure, I had trouble falling asleep at night, but at least I didn’t sit up the whole night vainly hoping tomorrow would never come. I looked weirdly nervous around my friends, but at least I had the energy to seek them out. And finally, I found the motivation to actually start on the two 30-page papers I had already lost half a semester to work on.
As these initial side effects subsided, those antidepressants quickly became the best choice I made for myself that entire semester. The pump of energy and enthusiasm was in no way outside of normal bounds. If anything, it was lower than what I would have “normally” felt. My depression and anxiety may not have been fixed, but I finally had agency over my body again. Most importantly, I finally had the strength to solve those “problems” that played a role in causing my depression in the first place.
While I still don’t believe that medication is the end-all-be-all solution to mental illness, I’ve come to realize that you can’t find the light at the end of the tunnel unless you actually have the energy to get up and start looking for it. It is only through the superficial happiness of antidepressants that I was able to achieve the real happiness that I feel today. After all, when we find ourselves with a high fever, we don’t just sit there and let it burn. We take an Ibuprofen.

Harvard asked a federal judge Friday to allow a number of current students and alumni to testify in support of its race-conscious admissions policies in court as the University battles a four-year-old lawsuit alleging it discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
“Harvard recognizes that the proposed witnesses may provide testimony that would be of use to the Court about the salience of race in the witnesses’ lived experiences, including their time at Harvard,” lawyers for the University wrote in a court filing.
Six alumni and eight current students had previously petitioned to participate in the suit when it goes to trial in a Boston courthouse — an event slated to take place Oct. 15. The petitioners requested time to give individual testimony, as well as make opening and closing statements.
Of the potential witnesses, three students and three alumni asked to testify on behalf of a coalition of 25 student organizations. These groups — including the Asian American Association, the Black Students Association, and Fuerza Latina —filed a brief in Aug. 2018 arguing Harvard’s use of affirmative action is necessary to fulfill the University’s educational mission.
Lawyers representing the organizations wrote in a Sept. 7 motion that the groups “have long been instrumental in Harvard’s realization of the educational benefits of diversity and are therefore uniquely qualified to assist the Court."
The remaining five students and three alumni petitioned to testify independently. They argued in their joint petition that they are uniquely positioned to share their experiences as “ethno-racial minorities.” One of the students is Thang Q. Diep ’19, a first-generation Harvard senior born in Vietnam who submitted unredacted portions of his admissions file in court over the summer in an effort to help his soon-to-be alma mater.
The students and alumni “uniformly believe that Harvard’s continued right to consider race to promote diversity is integral to their ability to access and thrive at one of our nation’s most elite training grounds for educational opportunities and future leadership,” according to their Aug. 31 motion.
But the group suing Harvard doesn't want the students to speak. Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions, which first sued the University in 2014, filed its own brief Friday arguing that Harvard undergraduates and alumni "have no personal knowledge about the Harvard admissions process" and "are not admissions policy-setters."
SFFA's lawyers further argued that, because the students already submitted amicus filings in support of Harvard and made individual declarations for the public record, their further participation is unnecessary and would inordinately extend the length of the trial.
The trial will be overseen by Judge Allison D. Burroughs at the U.S. District Courthouse in Boston.

Quentin A. Palfrey ’96, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, always knew he wanted to serve others.
As a Harvard undergraduate, Palfrey — a former Crimson news editor — co-founded Partners Empowering Neighborhoods, a public service program that he said fueled his passion for social justice.
Now, he’s running to be Massachusetts’s next lieutenant governor.
“Dating back to my time at Harvard, I’ve been very focused on issues around poverty and inequality, which are some of the major themes of my campaign,” Palfrey said in an interview. “I think I’ve always been interested in public service, and my family has been involved in politics for a long time.”
Indeed, Palfrey is the great-great grandson of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, Class of 1880.
He has more recent Harvard role models, too. Palfrey's parents, Sean G. Palfrey ’67 and Judith "Judy" S. Palfrey ’67, are pediatricians and professors who currently serve as the faculty deans of Adams House.
“They’ve been really wonderful surrogates and supporters during this entire process,” Palfrey said of his mother and father. “Going back to my childhood, I think a lot of my interest in fighting poverty and inequality has come from watching them serve some of the poorest patient populations in Boston and in Cambridge.”
Sean and Judy Palfrey said they see their family values reflected in their son’s campaign.
“The basis of his views are what we have lived and what he has grown up with,” Sean Palfrey said. “Quentin has been really looking forward to running for office ever since he was probably five or six.”
A few years after graduating magna cum laude from Lowell House with a joint degree in Social Studies and Philosophy, Palfrey — who wrote his senior thesis on the political philosophy of Nietzsche and Hegel — was accepted to Harvard Law School.
While earning his law degree, Palfrey said he worked with the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau to represent low-income clients in state court, particularly on issues of domestic violence, housing, and unemployment.
“I’ve been very focused since my time at Harvard and Harvard Law School on vulnerable populations and social justice,” he said.
Palfrey also said he was a member of the Harvard Law School Democrats. While at Harvard, he was taught by such notable names as U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.
“Professor Warren was my contracts professor during my first year of law school,” Palfrey said. “I learned from her about some of the tools we can use in the legal system and political system for fighting against inequality and standing up for consumers. I also studied under [Professor] Kagan and worked with her when she was solicitor general, which was a real honor.”
After graduating from Harvard Law, Palfrey worked in nonprofit management and in the Obama administration, most recently serving as the North America executive director of J-PAL, a poverty research lab at MIT.
In recent months, though, Palfrey has zeroed in on the challenges of the campaign trail. He and his parents have worked hard to convey his progressive platform and political experience to as many Massachusetts voters as possible.
According to Sean and Judy Palfrey — who have been helping their son campaign — Quentin Palfrey regularly visited three or four different places throughout the state each day to talk to voters in advance of the Sept. 4 primary.
“We were literally surrogates,” Sean Palfrey said, adding that he enjoyed explaining to strangers “who [Quentin] is, what his background is, what he’s interested in, why he’s a good man. And then Quentin comes in and, boom, he’s the person. He’s very dynamic.”
Quentin Palfrey said his running mate, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Jay Gonzalez, shares his progressive values.
“Jay Gonzalez has a really bold vision for where he wants to take Massachusetts, from really investing in transportation and education, to really leaning in, to leading on some of the big challenges we face, like the opioid crisis, climate change, and housing affordability,” Palfrey said.
Gonzalez and Palfrey will run on the same ticket against incumbent Republican Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 and Lieutenant Governor Karyn Polito.
Though recent polls have cemented Baker as the nation's most popular governor in recent memory, Palfrey said he remains hopeful for a Democratic surge this fall — spurred, he speculated, by discontent with President Donald Trump’s administration and policies.
In Palfrey’s eyes, his social justice-driven campaign offers Massachusetts voters an opportunity to combat the Republican-controlled federal government that he said Baker represents.
“Under Donald Trump, our values are under attack,” Palfrey said. “It's time for the states to lead on the issues that affect ordinary people and vulnerable populations.”
Devontae A.B. Freeland ’19, president of the Harvard College Democrats, said he agreed.
“The most important thing for Democrats in Massachusetts to do is to continually fight this idea that the race is automatically lost to Governor Baker,” Freeland said. “It is possible for Democrats to win this fall.”
Palfrey said he looks forward to a progressive blue wave, a phenomenon he described as a “new energy on the left” embodied by victories like Ayanna Pressley’s recent primary upset in Massachusetts’s 7th Congressional District.
“The turnout in the primary election in Massachusetts for Ayanna Pressley… was considerably higher than the polls and the pundits had predicted,” Palfrey said. “I think that what we’re seeing all across the country is a blue wave building of young people, of progressives and communities of color getting engaged at unprecedented levels.”
This November, Palfrey said, he hopes voters will bring their energy to the polls and that the Democratic party will continue to invest in local and state races, a move he said amounts to “taking a page from the conservatives’ playbook.”
“We need to go through the process of really investing in new voices and new candidates and more diverse candidates,” Palfrey said. “We need to build a grassroots movement across the country that will take decades but will also totally transform the political landscape.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Seventy-eight students declared their candidacy for seats on the Undergraduate Council over the weekend, representing a slight decline from the roughly 100 students who ran each of the past two years.
The deadline to declare was extended from Thursday to Saturday last week because the number of available seats exceeded the number of declared candidates in Adams House, according to election commission chair Jubin Gorji ’21. Even with the extension, only two students declared their candidacy in Adams, meaning one seat will remain empty.
Each freshman dorm and upperclassman house sends three representatives to the Council, except for Dudley House, which sends one representative.
Consistent with past years, the plurality of declared candidates are freshmen. Thirty-six freshmen — fewer than the 60 who declared last year — are vying for just twelve seats on the Council.
Multiple house elections will be competitive as well. In Kirkland, six students declared their candidacy, while five are running in Mather.
In interviews with roughly a half-dozen freshmen candidates on Friday, students cited a variety of factors motivating them to throw their hats in the ring.
Michael Y. Cheng ’22, a candidate in Elm Yard, said he hopes to use his influence on the UC to “reform” the comp process that some campus clubs use to select members.
“I didn’t come into college planning to run, but I think... during opening days and pre-orientation, I felt like Harvard was kind of like heavenly and everything went well,” he said. “But lately, I’ve been noticing some problems or complaints, which admittedly aren’t the end of the world.”
“I want to run to try to at least spark a discussion around some of those [issues],” he added.
Seoyoon Kim ’22, a candidate in Crimson Yard, said she plans to focus on fostering a stronger sense of “connection” between the Council and the broader student body.
“I feel like the UC does play a big role in terms of writing grants and passing large legislation throughout the College but a lot of people don’t view it as something that’s personal,” she said.  “So I want to make it more personal by hosting more Yard-wide and class-wide events.”
Candidates plan to campaign in different ways. While some said they plan to go door-to-door to speak with eligible voters, others said they will rely primarily on social media and postering.
The campaigning period will start on Monday at noon and run through Thursday at noon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Keezer’s Classic Clothing Store — a Harvard mainstay that bought and sold garments belonging to President John F. Kennedy Jr. '40 when he was an undergraduate — is once again open for business at a new location in Porter Square.
The store, which opened in 1895 and sells used and new men’s clothing, temporarily closed in 2017, threatening the establishment’s 122-year legacy. The previous owner sold both the business and the land beneath it, forcing Keezer’s new owner Dick Robasson to relocate to 1738 Massachusetts Avenue, according to store employee Matthew P. Silk.
Robasson purchased the shop this summer after identifying a possible replacement location in Porter Square. At the new venue, Robasson — who also runs the LeCouturier House of Alterations — plans to combine his tailor shop with Keezer’s to permit clients to buy a suit and have it fitted at the same location. The tailor shop will also begin selling women’s clothes including formal gowns and wedding dresses.
“You could say he saved us,” Silk said of Robasson.
Keezer’s has serviced generations of Harvard students. The store, which reopened Sept. 7, sees itself as a “Harvard tradition,” Silk said.
Longtime employee David P. Soodak noted that the relationship between Harvard affiliates and Keezer’s goes back decades.
“We have not only Harvard students but also Harvard professors who shop here,” Soodak said. “People from Harvard end up going all over the world so we can get a call from Hong Kong or somewhere and some Harvard alum will say, ‘Do you have a tailcoat 46 long?’”
Some of Harvard’s most notable alumni have frequented Keezer’s.
“JFK’s valet, he would come at the end of every semester and sell JFK’s clothing to us,” Soodak said.
Keezer's employees say the shop offers personalized service that online retailers can’t match.
“We’re able to just look at somebody and tell very close what their size is,” Soodak said.  “We’re very good at sending people away without anything because if it doesn’t fit they go, ‘Oh wow, this is great. I like this,’ and I’m like, ‘Yeah, but it doesn’t work on you.’ So we’re more geared towards helping people than selling.”
Looking forward, the new owner said he hopes the store will serve as a place where younger generations can learn about fashion.
“We’re going to keep Keezer’s about the same way — low price — but we’re going to see what kind of products new people need so we can go buy there,” Robasson said. He added he wants to “make the place a good place for young kids to come and hang out, and feel comfortable to come to look for something, and to be invited to stay to chat about style.”
For some students, the store provides a critical service.
Michael S. Giles ’19, a former business manager of the campus a capella group the Din & Tonics, said Din members have long frequented Keezer's.
“The Dins were founded in 1979 and this year is actually our 40th anniversary, and since the group was founded we’ve been going to Keezer’s,” Giles said.
The group has a longstanding tradition in which new members visit the shop to buy their performance attire each year. Giles said he is thrilled this tradition will continue.
“We’re very, very happy that they remain open, because it really is a unique resource not only for Harvard, but for people throughout the community here,” Giles said.

Hasty Pudding Theatricals has cast six women to perform in its 2019 show, completing a co-ed shift the group vowed last semester and ending an almost two-century period during which only men could act in Pudding productions.
Celia K. Kenney ’20, Ellen L. Shaheen ’21, Annabel O’Hagan ’19, Laura Sky H. Herman ’19, Shirley L. Chen ’22, and Ashley M. LaLonde ’20 were selected Sunday night as the first female Pudding cast members in Harvard history, according to an email obtained by The Crimson. This brings the Pudding’s cast — 12 in total this year, per the email — to gender parity.
The precedent-breaking announcement came after a long day of auditions and callbacks. Casting deliberations stretched until almost midnight. Around 11:30 p.m. — soon after Pudding leaders informed the 12 chosen students of their selection via email — members of the company could be seen leaving the group’s longtime digs in Farkas Hall to head to the Pudding’s campus clubhouse, where they toasted the newest cast members with what appeared to be champagne.
"We as an organization continue to be in awe of the level of talent of the students on Harvard’s campus, and we are so excited that for the first time in 175 productions, Harvard students of all genders will have the opportunity to showcase that talent on the Hasty Pudding stage," Pudding President Grace C. Ramsey '19 wrote in an emailed statement early Monday morning.

The six newly christened female cast members could not immediately be reached for comment.
The Pudding declared in Jan. 2018 that it planned to allow women to join its cast, drawing national media attention and spurring female students across campus to vow to audition this fall. Long considered Harvard’s premier theatrical group, the Pudding has maintained an all-male cast of performers since its founding in 1844, though women hold positions on the group’s business, tech, and design boards.
Controversy and questions over whether the Pudding would cast female actors have swirled to the fore in the past few years. Harvard women sought to join the Pudding’s cast at least three times in the last half-decade — and each time failed to earn callbacks. In Sept. 2016, more than 86 individuals signed an alumni petition urging the group to admit female cast members.
The Pudding’s declaration that it planned to go co-ed came mid-way through festivities held to honor Mila Kunis as the group’s 2018 Woman of the Year, an honor the company bestows on a different celebrity each year. The Golden Globe-winning actress may have played a role in pushing the group to change its policies.
Related: [Mila Kunis privately urged the Hasty Pudding graduate board to cast women]
Kunis phoned at least one member of the Hasty Pudding Institute’s graduate board to discuss adding women to the cast hours before the group made its announcement. And, during a later press conference, Kunis said she would not have participated in the Woman of the Year festivities had the Pudding not chosen to cast women.
“I would not be here otherwise,” she said.
Former Pudding President Andrew L. Farkas ’82 wrote in a letter at the time that the company had decided to go co-ed “some time ago” and chose to keep the decision quiet until the Woman of the Year celebrations.
The Pudding is one of several campus performing arts groups to open their doors to individuals of all genders in recent months. The formerly all-male a cappella group the Din and Tonics accepted its first female member over the weekend.
The Radcliffe Choral Society and the Harvard Glee Club also updated their membership policies to include people of all genders last semester.
Related: [Women audition for Hasty Pudding for third year, none receive callbacks]
Campus social groups — facing an administrative policy that strips privileges from members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations — are also increasingly adopting gender-neutral membership practices. Harvard’s sanctions, which took effect with the Class of 2021, bar members of these groups from holding club presidencies, varsity athletic team captaincies, and from receiving certain prestigious post-graduate fellowships.
Several historically all-male final clubs and fraternities promised to go co-ed earlier this semester. Every single sorority and historically all-female social group has done likewise, leaving Harvard’s campus without women-only social groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Lawrence S. Bacow returned to his home state of Michigan last week to tell residents: Harvard isn't so bad.
Bacow stopped through Detroit and Pontiac to make the case to locals that the University can positively impact their lives and neighborhoods. The trip, which came two months into Bacow’s fledgling presidency, falls at a moment when colleges and universities are facing a hostile political climate around the nation. When Bacow was appointed in February, he pledged to reach out to all parts of the country and address criticisms — some of which he called “fair” at the time — that Harvard caters to coastal elites.
Accompanied by Bridget Terry Long, the new dean of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, Bacow spoke to a group of high school students Thursday in Pontiac, Mich. He urged them to set ambitious goals and persevere in the face of adversity.
“It gave me a chance to to encourage them to dream and to set their heights high and not to believe anybody who tells them that they can’t do anything or that something is beyond their reach,” Bacow said in an interview Friday. “I actually told them that, if they think that’s the case, just tell them the president of Harvard told you that’s not true.”
Bacow called the experience “moving” not just for him, but also for the students, who were nearly all black or Latinx. Bacow added Pontiac is the poorest city in the state of Michigan and that, for that reason, he felt it was “important” students hear his message from someone who grew up there.
Bacow’s trip extended through Friday, when he traveled to Michigan’s largest city to speak at an event called “Detroit Homecoming.” Detroit “expats” congregated at the homcoming to reconnect with their hometown and to speak about issues facing the city and the rest of the state.
Bacow participated in a panel alongside M. Roy Wilson, the president of Wayne State University — a large public research university located in Detroit. Bacow cited Wilson, who graduated from Harvard Medical School, as an example of a Harvard alumnus who is doing important work in parts of the country outside of New England.
“I think it’s important that people understand that graduates of Harvard are working hard to make places like Detroit more vibrant, more interesting, and to create opportunity for others,” Bacow said.
He sought to debunk what he called a common belief that Harvard only helps those in its immediate radius.
“There’s a perception at least in parts of the country that only people who attend Harvard or only people who live nearby places like Harvard benefit from what we do,” he said.
Harvard sought to demonstrate a broad national reach during the decade-long tenure of former University President Drew G. Faust, too — especially in the months following the 2016 election, which left top Harvard administrators feeling concerned about the future of the University and higher education in America. Bacow’s visit to Michigan follows several similar trips Faust made during the waning months of her presidency to high schools in Philadelphia, Penn. and Cincinnati, Ohio, among other cities.
Bacow plans to continue this practice. He said Friday he hopes to visit more schools in the “heartland” of the country.
Public opinion regarding higher education has soured in recent years — a decline some would say culminated in Republican lawmakers' successful passage of a law last December that levied an “unprecedented” tax on some universities’ endowments. The tax would have cost Harvard an estimated $43 million in 2017. Faust lobbied extensively against the tax, and Bacow will likely follow in her footsteps.
Under Bacow, Harvard is also expanding its collaborations with universities beyond the Ivy League. Harvard and the University of Michigan recently announced a partnership in which the two schools will study issues of economic mobility and opioid addiction in Detroit and across the country.
“What I’ve tried to do on this trip is to connect with people in Detroit and Pontiac... and to help identify ways in which not just Harvard but universities around the country can work to try and address issues of income inequality, social mobility, opioid addiction, and other major issues which exist throughout the country,” Bacow said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard's historically all-male a capella group the Din and Tonics admitted its first female member on Saturday, according to a post on the group’s Facebook page.
Karalyn E. Joseph ’21, a soprano in Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, joined three other new inductees to the group, which describes itself on its website as the University’s “signature jazz a cappella group.”
This move marks an about-face from the group's refusal roughly two years ago to offer a callback to a female auditioner despite her "phenomenal" performance," as then-Dins President Jacques Berguig '18 told The Crimson at the time. Berguig explained the rejection by pointing to the group's constitution, which at the time barred women from joining.
The troupe has since updated its constitution to include a clause prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender. The most recent edits to the constitution — available on an internal College website — date to Nov. 2017.
“Membership in the Din & Tonics is open to all students currently enrolled in full time study in a degree granting faculty or school of Harvard University,” the organization’s constitution reads. “The group does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national or ethnic origin, age, or physical disability.”
The Din and Tonics is one of several capus music groups to adopt gender-neutral membership policies over the past few months. Last spring, the traditionally all-female Radcliffe Choral Society and all-male Harvard Glee Club updated their constitutions to explicitly welcome prospective members of all genders — though ony after receiving administrative pressure to do so.
In Jan. 2018, the Hasty Pudding Theatricals Club, Harvard's premier theatrical group, announced it would admit women into its historically all-male cast. Prior to that decision, women had thrice attended the group’s auditions in protest and over 86 individuals had signed a petition urging a co-ed shift. The Pudding announced Sunday night that it had accepted six women into its cast for the 2018-2019 school year, officially and finally breaking with almost two centuries of precedent.
As Harvard's artistic landscape pivots away from single-sex groups, its social scene is also shifting. Some campus social groups have come under fire from administrators in recent years for their single-gender status. Former University President Drew G. Faust debuted social group sanctions in May 2016 that bar members of unrecognized single-gender final clubs and Greek organizations from holding campus leadership positions, varsity athletic team captancies, and from receiving College endorsement for prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes.
In the years since, over a dozen previously single-gender social groups have gone co-ed or committed to doing so in the near future.
While performing groups are not subject to the sanctions, administrators reached out to Radcliffe Choral Society in spring 2018 asking the group to update its bylaws so it would come into compliance with the “mission of the College.”
Luis B. Valencia ’20, president of the Dins, declined to comment. Joseph, the group’s first female member, did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

In a physical game Sunday afternoon at Ohiri Field, the Harvard women’s soccer team and the Northeastern Huskies brought the heat with a high-intensity game marked by 32 total fouls.
The Crimson responded forcefully, however, winning a 2-0 slugfest on first-half goals by senior midfielder Leah Mohammadi and freshman forward Sophie Hirst. The victory moves Harvard to 3-4 on the season and drops Northeastern to 3-6-1.
Gaining a sense of resilience and grit will be integral to a young team yet untested in Ivy League waters. The current Crimson team, leaning on a large group of rookies to drive it forward, perhaps left Ohiri having just taken a massive step forward towards becoming a hardened, seasoned squad.
“We’ve had some really good moments, and we’ve also had some challenging opportunities to deal with adversity as well, and I think [the coaching staff] challenged the team today to be able to manage the moment,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “And as we’re preparing for Ivy League play, we want to possess the ball, we want to move the ball, we want to create some good chances, but at the end of the day, sometimes you just have to win ugly.”
Mohammadi, the team captain, got the scoring started in the 13th minute.
After being fouled hard running down the left side of the field, the Harvard senior set up and unleashed a line-drive free kick off the Northeastern wall and towards the far side of the goal. Senior Huskies goalie Nathalie Nidetch was unable to react to the deflection in time and the resulting tally gave Mohammadi her team-leading fourth goal of the season.
With a 1-0 lead in hand, the Crimson kept digging. As Hamblin noted, one thing that the squad worked on throughout the week was keeping the intensity up after they gained a lead.
“We were 1-0 up against Providence last week and played really well in the first half,” Hamblin said. “Then in the second half, they came out and really came at us, and we weren’t able to manage that. So we talked a lot about it this week—how do we manage the pressure? How do you manage being up? Keep attacking them, keep attacking them, instead of holding onto it.”
Almost immediately after Mohammadi’s strike, Harvard was back at it again.
Freshman midfielder Taylor Nielsen found sophomore forward Murphy Agnew with a deep outlet pass a minute later, and Agnew danced around the Northeastern backline, waiting for an opportunity to arise. That chance showed up in the form of Hirst, who snuck into the box whilst staying onside. Agnew threaded a perfect pass to Hirst, who finished past the outstretched arms of Nidetch to give the Crimson a 2-0 lead in the fourteenth minute.
“That’s what our focus really was on today, treating it like an Ivy League game, coming out, getting some first half goals and then extending that to the second half, ” Mohammadi said. “At the end of the first half, we had a little bit of a lull in our momentum, but we did a good job of possessing the second half and bringing the momentum back to our side.”
Both sides continued to play hard and fast for the remainder of the 90 minutes, but the early flurry proved to be all the scoring either side would manage.
“[Northeastern] swung momentum their way a little bit towards the end of the first half, beginning of the second half,” Hamblin said. “And I’m really proud of the resolve we showed just to defend well, make good choices, and manage the game well.”
Harvard’s defense stood strong in allowing the 2-0 lead to stand.
Senior goalie Danielle Etzel and junior goalie Kat Hess split time between the posts to keep Northeastern off the board, combining to record Harvard’s third shutout of the season. Both netminders took hits in the box but still achieved the end result—keeping the ball out of the net. Etzel’s 45 scoreless minutes, meanwhile, extended her scoreless streak to 356 minutes.
“The goalies have both been incredible,” Mohammadi said. “They’re competing with each other, and I think that they’re constantly pushing each other to be better.”
The Crimson and Huskies, despite the one-sided scoreline, matched up evenly in the box score.
Harvard took eight shots to Northeastern’s nine and forced the Huskies’ goalie into three saves. The Crimson made four saves—two credited to Hess, one to Etzel, and one to the Harvard team as a scramble in front of the net resulted in a cleared ball.
Hirst’s goal was her third of the season, while Nielsen and Agnew got their second and third assists of the season. The rookie class has been a vital cog in the Crimson engine—five of the team’s nine goals have been scored by freshmen.
“We grew up today, I think we really grew up today,” Hamblin said. “As a young team, we’ve made some mistakes, where experience would allow us to be able to navigate those situations, but today, we did a lot of the right things.”
It won’t always be perfect. Striving to be perfect can even hold you back. Harvard will now look to carry that tooth-and-nail experience into the rest of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the age of passing, quarterbacks dominate statistically in the NFL. Recent seasons have seen astronomical yardage values racked up by the league’s passers, with the leader often on pace for records set in the last decade. Through the first two weeks of the season, The leader has put up a whopping 819 yards in only two contests, leading his team to victory twice. There are many likely candidates: Drew Brees, Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers would be educated guesses. They would be wrong. Surprisingly enough, this quarterback has never been named to the Pro Bowl or even played in a playoff game. In fact, he started the season as his team’s backup quarterback. The next guess would then most likely be a young star from a big-name football university such as Oklahoma or Clemson. Again, these would be incorrect. He is a seasoned veteran and he has never competed for an NCAA national championship. Ryan Fitzpatrick, Harvard class of 2005, is leading the NFL in passing yards, and the veteran gunslinger is taking the league by storm.
On his seventh team and in his 14th season, Fitzpatrick does not seem the prime candidate to rise up the depth chart and surprise the NFL. However, Fitzpatrick’s recent ascent to the top of the statistical leaderboards is far from ordinary. In June, the NFL announced that Tampa Bay Buccaneers starting quarterback Jameis Winston—in only his fourth season—had been suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season. The reins were handed over to Fitzpatrick, the sixth-to-last pick in the 2005 draft. The experienced quarterback was most likely signed by Tampa Bay a year ago not only to serve as Winston’s backup, but to also use his vast knowledge to mentor a young quarterback new to the league. It now seems that the experienced Fitzpatrick may be threatening to take Winston’s job.
Success is not new to Fitzpatrick. While at Harvard, the Dunster resident dazzled in weekly demolitions of the various defenses of the Ivy League. In his last season on campus, Fitzpatrick earned Ivy League MVP honors while leading the Crimson to a perfect 10-0 record, including a 35-3 drubbing of Yale in The Game.
Fitzpatrick is now making NFL defenses look equally silly. Opening the season as 10-point underdogs on the road against the New Orleans Saints, Fitzpatrick completed 21 of 28 passes for 417 yards and four touchdowns with zero interceptions. The veteran passer even added on 12 carries for 36 yards and another score on the ground. This week, he proved the performance was no fluke. Facing the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, Fitzpatrick completed 27 of 33 passes for 402 yards and four touchdowns with one interception. Next week, the Buccaneers host the Pittsburgh Steelers, who were most recently torched for 42 points and six passing touchdowns from second-year Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.
Although he is currently causing headaches for opposing defensive coordinators, Fitzpatrick is charming NFL fans with his actions on and off the field. During the victory over the Eagles, the quarterback was seen comically rubbing enormously bushy beards with offensive lineman Evan Smith. After the game, reporters were entertained by Fitzpatrick wearing aviator sunglasses and a slick black jacket unzipped to reveal a gold chain and chest hair that matched his beard. The conference was interrupted when teammate DeSean Jackson entered the room, and Fitzpatrick admitted that he had borrowed Jackson’s personal items for the press conference. When a reporter asked if anything of Fitzpatrick’s was actually his, the quarterback quipped, “The chest hair is mine.” If Fitzpatrick keeps his current trajectory while standing in for Winston, clothing may not be the only thing he steals from a teammate.
