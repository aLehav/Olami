After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concluding a year-long evaluation, House discretionary budgets allocated by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have been modestly increased by up to five percent, with Quad Houses receiving the lion’s share in an attempt to correct for previous funding imbalances between Houses. While inequities in House budgets persist, this is an encouraging step forward in the effort to equalize the House funding system. All Harvard students should enjoy the same opportunities and amenities, regardless of the Houses to which they are randomly assigned.
First and foremost, additional transparency in regards to House discretionary funding is crucial. Due to the vague nature of allocations, most students are unaware of how money is spent or even who decides how to spend it. For this reason, increased information and dialogue would be beneficial.
Gossip regarding gross imbalances in House endowments adds to the problem as it circulates amongst undergraduates; for instance, rumors of Eliot House’s vault of alumni contributions contrast sharply with the perceived inadequacy of Quad funds. To correct these perceived—and possibly real—inequalities, Harvard is right to take proactive measures to level the playing field. FAS’s recent move was a welcome means to that end, and for that Harvard deserves praise.
While the aforementioned perception of River House funds dwarfing those of Quad Houses may be overblown by hearsay, some Houses were certainly associated with privilege in the past. Before the randomization of the housing system, the self-selection of specific Houses by wealthier students may have led to endowment imbalances that could exist to this day. Older Houses like Adams and Eliot are likely have stronger alumni bases when compared with Quad Houses and newer River Houses, and FAS’s recent allocation decision represents an effective way of rectifying this potential gap.
In the spirit of equalizing the residential experience, the Undergraduate Council should change the system it uses to allocate House funding, as well. Distribution should occur on a per-capita basis to promote equal enjoyment of student life. Providing funding based on the number of students in each House would maximize the utility of this money and send a message that each individual’s experience is a priority.
FAS took advisable action in working to improve student life, but this step should not be the last. Administrators must realize that there are far more aspects to the Harvard experience than can be encompassed by House discretionary spending. It is our hope that Harvard continues to develop innovative ways to enhance student life here on campus.

For freshmen and many upperclassmen alike, Harvard’s many organizational “comps” have already commenced. These semester-long boot camps for students wishing to join a particular extracurricular are intended to weed out the resume padders and instead court the most committed “compers” to execute the organization’s missions in the years to come. But an unintended consequence of the comp design is the stomping out of dissenters who object socially or ideologically to an organization’s existing dogma. These individuals can be invaluable to guiding an organization in fresh directions; by eliminating them, overzealous comp processes are weakening student organizations in the long term.
In his book “Going to Extremes,” Harvard’s Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law Cass R. Sunstein argues that in cases where free exit exists for members in a group, group discourse tends to produce more extreme views. Collectively, a self-selecting group is prone to arrive at a more polarized view than to which even the median member may subscribe individually. This idea is exemplified at Harvard, where the comp process encourages unnatural polarization in club ideologies. The method of self-selection is the comp, which is in many ways advertised as a chance for the comper to feel out whether a club is the right fit. Difficult and involved comps suggest a rigid “take-it-or-leave-it” attitude that counters the idea that organizations should be truly freethinking and open to fresh ideas and new members. A comp suggests a four-month timeframe for a newcomer to conform to the traditions, mindsets, and workings of an organization’s social and ideological scene. In many cases, it is a vehicle to vetting prospective members on the basis of personality qualities over actual competency. It defaults existing institutional memory as dictating an organization’s future, although new and prospective members should be the ones responsible for shaping the organization in future years.
There are certainly right approaches to recruiting club members, but the excitement shown at the Activities Fair at Hilles can wither when compers later fall out of line with a club’s existing dogma. If student organizations eased up on their comp processes, then they would retain more students who simply do not like or see the point of jumping through hoops to gain entrance to an organization; they would gain students less wedded to existing bureaucracy and procedure and more open to changing the organization and making it stronger. The perpetuation of organizational homophily vis-à-vis the vetting of new and different members serves only to build more extreme and polarized groups at Harvard—niches that, in the end, are detrimental not just to organizations but also to individual members’ abilities to encounter new and diverse people and viewpoints in their time at college. Student leaders should strive to expand their organization’s ideological bases also to better serve the personal needs of members, in widening their intellectual experiences in college.
While organizations like The Crimson may need comps to ensure that prospective members gain the skills required, the emphasis placed on this admissions process should be lessened. New members should be integrated further into an organization earlier, and given the free agency to scale involvement. While it is appropriate for the executive boards of organizations to have stringent competency requirements, for general membership these requirements and hurdles should be lessened. Harvard extracurriculars should be about meeting more, different people and if institutional barriers hinder this, they should be removed for the greater good.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There was a significant election on September 14. No, it wasn’t the primary for a senate seat, or even for a governorship. It did, however, have ramifications for Washington, D.C. and for the nation.
I’m talking about the Democratic primary for the office of mayor of the District of Columbia. Council Chairman Vince C. Gray defeated incumbent Mayor Adrian Fenty in convincing fashion. This election was significant because it could mean the forced or voluntary departure of the D.C.  Public School system’s controversial chancellor, Michelle A. Rhee.
Rhee, a former Teach for America corps member and founder of a non-profit that recruits teachers for public schools, took over the school system after Fenty became mayor in 2007. Fenty had written legislation giving him mayoral control over the schools and asked Rhee to run the system. She became chancellor on the condition that Fenty would give her the political cover necessary to make unpopular reforms in the country’s worst school system.
It was a deal. As soon as she stepped into her office, Rhee immediately closed down 23 under-enrolled schools and fired principals. In July, she fired an unprecedented 241 teachers for poor performance on the District’s new teacher evaluation system. Rhee has been a polarizing figure in D.C., popular nationally for her cutting edge reforms and contentious locally for those Washingtonians who wish she wouldn’t fire their teachers and close their schools.
Now that Fenty has gotten the boot, Rhee may quit, if, as presumed, Mayor Gray doesn’t fire her.
This past summer, I interned in the D.C. Public Schools’ central office. Needless to say, the results from this election disappointed me. It was a sad day for the schoolchildren of Washington, whose tests scores have seen dramatic improvement since 2007. Rhee brought a mission and a sense of urgency to Washington, but she also captivated the nation. She is a superstar among policy wonks and education reformers. Then-Senator Barack H. Obama and Senator John S. McCain discussed her in a presidential debate; she was even on a notorious Time Magazine cover. Without her name at the front of the nationally recognized DCPS brand, can the education reform efforts sustain a national presence?
The end of Rhee’s tenure in the D.C. schools would be a shock to the budding education reform movement. D.C. was a petri dish for many of the efforts that education reformers have long advocated but have been unable to implement in the traditional public school system. The election may end Rhee’s time in Washington, but it shouldn’t stifle the reform movement as a whole. Rhee-formers should recognize that the chancellor is but one woman. She is not the only agent of change. If she does leave D.C., she will not take the wave of reform with her.
What impressed me most about Rhee’s central office were the people. They are intelligent, deliberate, motivated. The sense of purpose DCPS employees take to their work is inspiring. DCPS has been dysfunctional for too long, and every day, central office staff work to stop the bleeding.
Fenty’s loss might suggest that education reform is fundamentally unsustainable, but I don’t think that is the case. Reformers ought to continue forward with as much exigency as ever. If they do, they will be able to continue the revolution that Rhee has boldly pioneered in Washington. The education reform movement needs visionaries like Rhee, but it also requires a coordinated effort by valiant foot soldiers—teachers, central office employees, and administrators—to fix the schools and to fix them fast.
Rhee’s tenure in D.C. is one example of the wave of education reform looming in the United States, but there are other movements not linked to just one individual. The proliferation of charter schools is one example. So is the Department of Education’s Race to the Top funding for state-level school innovation. Now is the time for the reformers at work on these other movements to redouble their efforts on behalf of students. Rhee’s efforts have been a significant step in bringing education to the forefront of the American political consciousness, but her potential departure cannot dissuade others from joining the broad revolution she represents.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Aug. 3, President Felipe Calderón of Mexico called for a national debate on the legalization of drugs.  Shortly afterwards, former president Vicente Fox demanded the outright legalization of all drugs in order to remove the monopoly guaranteed to the drug trafficking organizations by the current state of prohibition.  A year earlier, three other former Latin American presidents—Fernando Cardoso of Brazil, César Gaviria of Colombia, and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico—issued a report explaining why Latin American nations and the United States should abandon the “War on Drugs” and consider legalization as part of an initiative to begin treating drug use as a public health issue rather than a criminal issue.
The debate in the United States has not yet reached this stage: no politician with presidential ambitions could imply support for the legalization of marijuana—let alone all drugs—and hope to win even the nomination of either of the major parties.  Most of this discrepancy in attitudes between the US and its southern neighbors can be explained by the much larger threat presented by drug-related crime in those countries.  Much of the rest of this gap is best understood in the context of the United States’ peculiar drug enforcement history.
In 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed, marking the beginning of marijuana prohibition in the U.S.  This fact itself, however, is less notable than the circumstances under which the bill was passed.
In 1919, The New York Times published an editorial warning that, unless a law was passed to prohibit it, an unknown new drug known as marijuana originating from Mexico would soon replace heroin and other “hard narcotics” (restricted five years earlier by the Harrison Act) as the addict’s drug of choice.  The article made no mention of the actual effects of marijuana; it merely associated it with heroin and “narcotics.”  In doing so, it provided the American public’s first impression of marijuana as a drug.
Fast forward back to 1937.  During the hearings preceding the passage of the Marihuana Tax Act, Commissioner Harry Anslinger of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics quotes in front of Congress, “Marihuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity, criminality, and death.” This statement went unquestioned by those observing the proceedings.  No debate took place preceding the bill’s passage in the Senate, and the bill was passed in the House of Representatives after the following exchange between a representative from New York and Speaker Sam Rayburn: “Mr. Speaker, what is this bill about?” “I don’t know.  It has something to do with a thing called marihuana.  I think it’s a narcotic of some kind.”
With this information in mind, consider the etymology of the word “narcotic.”  From the Greek “narkotikon” meaning “making stiff or numb,” “narcotic” denotes drugs that put people to sleep.  This label fails to describe the most common illegal drugs present in the US today; in fact, drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine do precisely the opposite.  How, then, does the word “narcotic” affect the national discourse on drugs?
Imagine for a moment the reaction of the average American parent after having just been informed that X percent of people under the age of 18 use recreational drugs.  Now imagine their reaction after being informed that the same percentage of people use narcotics.  Not quite the same, is it?  “Narcotics” seem foreign, they seem inherently dangerous, and they seem unforgivably criminal.
The word “narcotics” is hardly ever used in a positive light: it appears almost exclusively in association with criminal activity or the law enforcement designed to combat it.  “Drugs,” on the other hand, is a morally neutral word, referring to anything from opium or alcohol to essential medicines such as penicillin or aspirin. Although the Federal Bureau of Narcotics has since been renamed as the Drug Enforcement Agency, its legacy in the popular consciousness lives on in the form of countless references to “narcotic drug abuse” in legislation such as the Controlled Substances Act, which continues to serve as the core document of drug law in the US.
It is both inaccurate and unjust to continue referring to all illegal drugs as narcotics. Such rhetoric distorts rational thinking on the subject and stalls efforts to reach a better solution. Discussing the most effective way to regulate controlled substances can therefore be done in a less misleading and more honest way under the label of “drug law” than “counter-narcotics.”

Nestled between the offices for the Cambridge Arts Council on the second floor of City Hall is a wide open room, minimalist enough to walk by without noticing. But this room contains “Of, By, and For,” an exhibition of new projects commissioned by the Cambridge Arts Council. The projects have started to draw local and—in the case of the new arts initiative “Crossing Non-Signalized Locations”—national attention.
According to Daniel J. Peltz, Associate Professor of Film/Animation/Video at Rhode Island School of Design, the project grew out of an intensive residency over the winter after he had been asked by the Arts Council earlier this year to propose a public works project for the city. “Crossing Non-Signalized Locations” was an attempt to redefine the relationship between the parking authority and the residents of Cabmridge.This includes poetic street signs (“If you’re reading this sign, you’re reading this sign”); parking boots made of stuffed fabric; “10,000 Excuses,” which collects electronic parking disputes into one image; and parking ticket envelopes depicting a cartoon traffic officer and women doing yoga to give and receive the ticket. The envelope, while still relatively new, is the initiative being met with the most controversy. “Right now, it is largely sensational,” said Jason Weeks, Executive Director of the Cambridge Arts Council. “But early responses have been good. People are interested and intrigued by it.
”But according to other media outlets, the response from Cambridge residents hasn’t been so warm; United Press International ran the story under the headline “Motorists not calmed by yoga citations” on Sept. 21. “One thing I’ve noticed is that people don’t look very closely at the figures,” Peltz said about the recent negative press. “I think I would look at the two characters, look at what are they doing.”
“I might even try it out,” Peltz added. “But that’s just me.”
The project will run until Nov. 17.

This summer, a Cambridge park on Pacific Street near Central Square found something to do with dog feces other than decorate the undersides of our sneakers. The Park Spark project, which ended last Friday, consisted of a digester that converted dog feces into energy in the form of methane. Its creator, conceptual artist Matthew Mazzotta, strives to build systems that restore peoples’ connections to their environment, and reveal the impact that our actions have on our surroundings.
Through Park Spark, he hoped that people would start questioning the way they deal with waste. Usually, dog owners pick up their dogs’ waste in a plastic bag, dump it into a trash can, and forget about it.
“Waste doesn’t go away when we put it in garbage cans,” said Mazzotta. Once at a landfill, the organic waste releases methane, a greenhouse gas 30 to 70 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere.Conventionally, farms have been targeted as sources of methane gas. Inspiration for Park Spark came when Mazzotta started thinking about the waste produced by “animals of the city”—humans and their canine best friends.
At Park Spark, dog owners put their pets’ waste in biodegradable bags and throw it into an airtight methane digester. Anaerobic bacteria breaks down the waste, releasing the methane for the machine to collect.
But there’s more—the energy that comes from burning methane can be harnessed to power anything else, and Mazzotta has left it up to the community to decide what project it wants to invest in.This year’s Park Spark was a pilot, meant to be a catalyst for more interesting projects. Park Spark itself will be back next spring. “When it returns, it will be able to take different forms,” said Mazzotta.
Even such ingenuity and good science, however, can never win over all the skeptics.  Local dog owner Mario Ortiz said, “It’s a great idea...if it works.”

On the fateful day of the Harvard-Yale football game, most would expect to see Undergraduate Council President Johnny F. Bowman ’11 yelling wildly from the stands, decked out in crimson. Not this year, mon frere. Instead, Bowman will be 30,000 feet in the air, flying back from Moscow with 14 other American college student leaders.
In an attempt to forge a stronger partnership between Russia and the United States, the Russian Federation’s Federal Agency on Youth Affairs has invited the select group to spend a jam-packed week primarily visiting government sectors like the Presidential Administration and the Supreme Commercial Court. The agency is offering this trip for the first time and will determine its permanence once the students return home.
However, this isn’t Bowman’s first experience globe-trotting as UC President. In late August, Bowman spent six days in Hunan and Beijing, China with a delegation of Ivy League student leaders thanks to China’s Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. Highlights included visiting a model communist village, (it was “100 percent clean and extremely well-organized” according to Bowman); meeting Xiao Yayu, the deputy director for the Standing Committee of Hunan Provincial Growth; and conversing with Chinese college students.
“They were open about their disappointment in some of China’s policies. They were much more open than I had anticipated,” said Bowman, a reflection which just might fulfill the committee’s hope that the visit helped promote a connection between the two groups of students.
Likewise, UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 will travel to Shanghai at the end of this month to attend the World Expo Youth Summit.
“International relations is not our main purpose on the UC, but it’s a nice opportunity for us,” said Hysen.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tufts University professor Daniel C. Dennett discussed the ways in which neuroscience may impact human understanding of moral and legal responsibility to an overflowing audience in Pound Hall at Harvard Law School yesterday.
The event, titled “Free Will, Responsibility, and the Brain,”  was sponsored by the Law School’s Student Association for Law and Mind Sciences (SALMS), and began with a Dilbert comic strip depicting free will as an ambiguous concept.
“It does justice to our common sense thinking about free will,” he said of the comic strip.
Dennett, who co-directs the Tufts University Center for Cognitive Studies, is best known for his arguments that human consciousness and free will are the result of physical processes in the brain.
Early in the talk, Dennett asked the audience to flick their right wrists in the next ten seconds, explaining that their brains decided to perform the action a third of second before it actually occurred.
The experiment showed, he said, that unconscious action of the brain precedes the conscious action of an individual.
“Your conscious is out of the loop,” he said. “A voluntary act begins in the brain unconsciously before the person acts consciously.”
Yet Dennett said that the last minute “veto window,” also known as “free won’t,” allows conscious function to affect the final outcome.
Through the discussion, Dennett said he hoped to figure out how to undo the misunderstandings surrounding neuroscience’s implications on human responsibility.
He mentioned the common belief that determinism is incompatible with free will, but quickly dismissed it as a mistake.
The talk was intended to pique interest in understanding the human animal, in accordance with SALMS’s efforts to expose the Law School community to research and concepts from psychology, neuroscience, and other mind sciences, said SALMS President Matthew B. McFeely.
“I hope that attendees of the talk were encouraged to examine a little closer some of commonly held assumptions about people and their behavior,” McFeely said.

A 100-year-old Mexican corn tortilla, a 19th century American painter’s palette, and a stuffed Bengal tiger will count among objects undergraduates will study in a new General Education course University Professor Laurel T. Ulrich will teach this spring.
“Instead of a pile of reading, we’ve got a pile of stuff,” Ulrich said, adding that she expects the course to attract students with “a strong interest in working with objects.”
The exhibition, “Making a World”, will open in the Science Center for the duration of the new Gen Ed course, “Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History,” to be taught by Ulrich and Ivan Gaskell, a former curator of paintings at the Fogg Museum.
“Making a World” will feature projects by students enrolled in History 84c, a seminar on interdisciplinary perspectives on objects in North America that the two are teaching this semester.
Gaskell and the exhibition’s project manager, Sarah A. Carter ’02, said they will select objects they believe tell interesting stories as well as mystery objects—items the students will attempt to identify and contextualize within Harvard’s museum collections.
“We hope that people will feel encouraged to discover the corners of Harvard and Harvard’s relation to the world,” Gaskell said, adding that Harvard’s various collections are often “under-utilized” as an “amazing resource for teaching.”
Ulrich said an object’s origin and its relation to the rest of the collection will shed light on how students understand history in the new course.
Kristen A. Keerma, a teaching fellow for History 84c, said she thinks “Making a World” is “both a playful and provocative move in a new direction” for students interested in museum studies.
Katherine A. O’Leary ’11, a History 84c student working on the exhibition, agreed, stating that she sees material objects as “a chance to study a primary source.”

The topic of immigration in the United States sparked two debates among students and faculty across campus last night.
Representatives from four undergraduates student groups—the Harvard Republican Club, the Harvard College Democrats, The Harvard Salient, and Perspective Magazine—met in Adams House to present their views on U.S. immigration policy at an event that soon escalated into a heated discussion during which several students shared how their families had been affected.
Both the Harvard Dems and Perspective Magazine advocated “amnesty” policies, with the Dems arguing that the “greatest problem” when it comes to immigration policy is “failing to recognize the humanity of immigrants”.
The Harvard Dems suggested there is “a lot of racial hatred when it comes to discussions of immigration.”
Representatives from The Salient stressed the issues of “American sovereignty, the rule of law, and fairness” as they relate to immigration policy and concluded that a policy of “enforcement” would be best since past “amnesty policy” attempts in the 1980s failed.
One topic that stirred much debate was racism, as liberal participants held that race and racism were underlying themes of conservative notions of immigration policy.
At a different event held in the Fong Auditorium sponsored by the Harvard Foundation, two panelists discussed challenges in forming immigration policy, such as tensions between federal and state legislatures.
Moderated by Luisa L. Heredia, a lecturer in the sociology department, the panel featured Colombian-born Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Edward Schumacher-Matos facing off against Richard Chacon, who heads the Massachusetts Office of Refugees and Immigrants.
The two focused on the recent legislation passed in Arizona which Schumacher-Matos described as a law that “required the police to stop and question anyone who looked like they might be here illegally.”
“And any citizen could sue their police department if they didn’t do that,” he said.
Schumacher-Matos encouraged students to continue driving the immigration debate on college campuses.

Doctors have trouble communicating with terminally ill black cancer patients about their condition, according to a study released in the Archive of Internal Medicine by Harvard and Dana Farber Cancer Institute-affiliated researchers.
The study followed 71 black patients and 261 white patients, all of whom were in advanced stages of cancer, in treatment centers across the country beginning in 2002. Harvard Medical School professors Holly G. Prigerson and Jennifer W. Mack conducted the study with the help of researchers at other institutions.
In the study, doctors held end-of-life-conversations—during which they reveal to a patient that his or her cancer is terminal, and discuss treatment options—with 35.3 percent of black patients and 38.4 percent of white cancer patients.
The study found that after partaking in those conversations, only 32 percent of black patients indicated that they knew their cancer was terminal, as opposed to 47 percent of white patients. Mack said.
Mack said that if patients understand that their cancer is terminal, they are more likely to chose care to ease their symptoms rather than life-prolonging treatment.
The study found that 19.7 percent of black patients chose to pursue life-prolonging treatment, compared to 6.9 percent of white patients.
Additionally, the findings indicated that black patients did not get the end-of-life treatment they had planned for; black patients who signed “do not resuscitate” orders were just as likely to get life-prolonging treatment as black patients who did not sign such an order.
“Any mismatch can influence the way the communication process goes in the [doctor’s office],” Mack said. She said the miscommunication might be a result of black patients being treated by non-black doctors, cultural differences in the way information is interpreted, and doctors unintentionally communicating differently to black patients.
Prigerson, the principal investigator for the study, said the discrepancy might be related to the religious beliefs of black patients, who tend to be more religious than white patients. She said that end-of-life conversations have little impact on religious patients because they believe their health depends on a higher authority.
K. “Vish” Viswanath, professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and another co-author of the study, said that the cause of the disparity is unclear, but also said he thinks that making information on terminal illness easier to understand and access will help all patients to better understand their condition.
According to Prigerson, the National Cancer Institute has agreed to fund a second study to investigate why end-of-life conversations appear less effective with black patients.
“We have a lot to learn, but [this study] gave us areas to focus on,” Mack said.

Former Harvard President Derek C. Bok debated with his wife Sissela Bok how to find happiness at the Harvard Graduate School of Education last night.
Both have written books on happiness published earlier this year. But neither had an answer for the audience.
“[Happiness research] is a growing field, and no one is really an expert,” Derek Bok said.
His book, “The Politics of Happiness,” focuses on how to incorporate happiness in the crafting of public policy.
Bok argued that on a broader level, what makes people happy will be good for society.
“Happiness is not a zero-sum game,” he said.
Bok pointed to the Bhutan government’s use of “gross national happiness” as an alternative to gross domestic product to measure a nation’s prosperity.
Simply focusing on maximizing economic wealth, he argued, is not enough to increase a country’s overall level of happiness.
In the United States, for example, economic growth has not been associated with an increase in Americans’ happiness.
Sissela Bok, a visiting fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, said she had not been interested in the academic study of happiness until her husband showed her data that listed Sweden, her home country, as the happiest in the world.
Her book, “Exploring Happiness,” also published this year, explores the philosophical nature of happiness.
She argued that people often struggle to find experiences that will keep them happy. She suggested that art or music has the capacity to sustain people’s levels of happiness.
The audience, which included graduate students and faculty, peppered the couple with questions ranging from how young people should view happiness to how the two approached research and writing.
Nina Teng, a second-year at Harvard Kennedy School who worked on the Gross National Happiness Commission of Bhutan, said Bhutan is one of the few countries in the world to consciously incorporate happiness in public policy.
“I appreciated their views on understanding happiness on a deeper level and also its potential application to policy,” she said.

The MacArthur Foundation announced yesterday morning that population geneticist Carlos D. Bustamante ’97 and Harvard professor Annette Gordon-Reed have been named 2010 MacArthur Fellows.
They are two of 23 recipients of this year’s “genius grant,” which awards fellows $500,000 over five years.
Gordon-Reed, a 1984 graduate of the Law School, was named to the Harvard faculty last spring.
In the fall of 2011, she will begin teaching as a professor of history in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and at the Law School. She will also hold a professorship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Gordon-Reed won the 2009 Pulitzer Prize in history for her book, “The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,” which follows the bloodline of four generations of a slave family descended from Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson.
Bustamante is currently a professor at Stanford University School of Medicine. He studies DNA sequence data to better understand the dynamics and migration of populations and the mechanisms of evolution and natural selection.
“Bustamante is developing a rigorous, quantitative foundation for addressing fundamental questions about genetics and evolution across species...and about the complex origins of human genetic diversity,” according to the MacArthur Foundation’s website.
Recipients are nominated by invited experts, often without knowing that they are being considered for the award. Gordon-Reed said she was completely taken by surprise when she learned two weeks ago that she would be awarded the fellowship.
“I was watching the TV show ‘House’ and the phone rang and it was not who I expected it to be,” she said. Instead, the caller was a representative of the MacArthur Foundation informed her that she had been awarded a fellowship.
“I was completely stunned. It was the furthest thing from my mind. I was in a daze,” Gordon-Reed recalled.
When she first learned of the award, Gordon-Reed was permitted to tell only her husband. She only informed her children Monday night, and the MacArthur Fellows were announced publicly yesterday morning.
Gordon-Reed is currently working on a book documenting another generation of the Hemingses and has plans to write a biography of Thomas Jefferson.
The grant, Gordon-Reed said, will enable her to travel more widely in conducting her research,
“Before, I had to think ‘can I really afford to go down there?’ Now I won’t have to think about it. It’s a tremendous luxury,” Gordon-Reed said.
Gordon-Reed is currently on a fellowship at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. Last year, she was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in the Humanities.
“Professor Gordon-Reed’s remarkable work will be read for generations because of its originality, scrupulousness, rigor, and imagination,” said Harvard Law School Dean Martha L. Minow yesterday in a press release.

Ahmet Davutoglu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Republic of Turkey, advocated for a new, all inclusive global order at a heavily secured event at the Institute of Politics last night.
“There should be a new political order that is all-inclusive, transparent, and just,” Davutoglu said, in light of changes in the global climate since the end of the Cold War.
According to Davutoglu, this ideology extended to the role of the United States in the world, and he argued that the United States should become “more philosophical and all-inclusive,” in order to sustain its global power.
Davutoglu also described a need for a new economic and cultural order that is fair and inclusive toward all countries.
During the question and answer session, Davutoglu discussed the Israeli attack on a Gaza aid flotilla in late May that killed nine Turkish activists and drew outrage from the Turkish population.
In response to a question from Can Soylu ’14 about how public opinion affects foreign policy decisions, Davutoglu said that in a democratic country, one has to accept that public opinion varies between positive and negative and added that at times, groups not affiliated with the government will take action that has broad, negative effects on public opinion.
“I would have been even more pleased [with his response] if he had talked about how this event shaped Turkish relations and how we were going to pick up the pieces from this incident,” Soylu said later to The Crimson.
Answering another question regarding the flotilla incident, Davutoglu said that “Palestinians have suffered enough,” and went on to advocate for a two-state solution to the Arab Israeli conflict.
“If we think that some countries have more rights than others, it is difficult to achieve this peace,” he said in reference to Israeli settlements.
Earlier in the day, Davutoglu met with a group of Turkish students from the College and the grad schools, A. Cansu Aydede ’11 said. The conversation, during which Davutoglu answered students’ questions, was conducted in Turkish.
One of the questions concerned Turkey’s opinion of the European Union. Davutoglu responded that Turkey had done everything the E.U. had asked, such as resolving tensions in Cyprus, and that it is now the responsibility of the European states to make progress. “From now on, it’s up to them,” he said, according to a translation by Soylu.

Four House dining halls will be closed for the three days of Columbus Day weekend, causing 180 students in one House to sign a petition asking for the restoration of dining hall service that weekend.
Dining halls in Currier, Dunster, Kirkland, and Winthrop­ will be closed over Columbus Day weekend “in an effort to be fiscally responsible at a time of continued financial constraints,” Harvard University Hospitality and Dining Services spokeswoman Crista Martin wrote in an e-mailed statement.
After examining last year’s traffic in the House dining halls, HUHDS concluded that the closures would be an “area of efficiency” because many students appeared to have left campus for the holiday, according to Martin. All dining halls had remained open during that time last year.
But students did not greet the decision to shut down the dining halls with approval and said that for most undergraduates, the three-day weekend does not pose an opportunity to leave campus.
“I don’t notice many people leave at all,” Dunster House Committee social chair Annemette H. Harnes ’12 said.
The Currier House Committee started a petition that called upon HUHDS to reverse its decision, arguing that dining hall workers would face fewer work days and accusing HUHDS of staying quiet about the closures.
The petition has drawn 88 online signatures, and Currier HoCo secretary Amy Rosenthal ’11 said that 90 people have signed the physical version of the petition.
“I do feel very strongly personally that it’s wrong,” Rosenthal said. “We tried to get students to turn in petitions because we really feel like they’re not treating their workers fairly.”
Martin said that the workers are paid for the shifts they work and for University-recognized holidays, including Columbus Day itself.
She added that HUHDS has displayed the closure on its online calendar and will make the announcement via table tents and kiosks.
Many students said they were irked by the lack of any announcement.
A Dunster House resident tutor said she had not been notified of the closure, and several students voiced displeasure with HUHDS’ silence.
“It’s a minor inconvenience,” said Dunster resident Troy D. Schilperoort ’12 of his dining hall’s expected closure. “It’s more inconvenient that I didn’t hear about it.”
“I don’t think anyone here really realizes it yet,” said Harnes, the Dunster HoCo member. “They still haven’t told us yet.”

Harvard boasts the highest number of top-performing doctoral programs, according to a National Research Council report released yesterday.
The report, which drew on five years of data analysis, ranked 27 of 52 Harvard doctoral programs surveyed as best in the nation.
University officials said they were pleased with the report’s assessment of graduate programs across the University.
“These results are a tribute to the quality of the students, faculty, and staff at work across every part of this University,” President Drew G. Faust wrote in a statement.
Of the Harvard programs surveyed, 90 percent placed among the top five in the nation under at least one of two ranking methods.
Harvard’s economics, neuroscience and English programs were ranked number one in their fields under both ranking systems, which depended on faculty survey results.
Harvard outperformed peer institutions in the number of top-ranking doctoral programs. Princeton had the second highest number of top-ranking doctoral programs, with 19 receiving a top ranking in at least one ranking scheme. Yale saw 12 of its programs listed as best in the nation.
Allan Brandt, dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, echoed Faust’s excitement in an interview with the Crimson.
“It says something very positive about the things that we’ve been very committed to in the graduate school, in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and across the University,” he said.
Brandt said the report validated some of the University’s concerted efforts to build programs in particular fields. As an example, he pointed to the strong showing of the doctoral program in sociology, which received a top ranking.
“That didn’t happen by accident,” he said.
But the strength of some of Harvard’s traditional powerhouses was also confirmed in yesterday’s report.
“We’re thrilled obviously,” said John Y. Campbell, chair of the Economics Department. “I believe us to be the best graduate program,” he added. “[But] we do have tough competition every year, particularly with MIT.”
Brandt said the report’s release provided long-anticipated closure to a process that dates back to the NRC’s last report, in 1995.
The report used data gathered from the 2005-2006 academic year to measure an array of parameters that included faculty publications, faculty grants, student GRE scores and post-graduate student scores.
“It’s always gratifying to have things that you know internally confirmed by a very complex and data-rich process,” Brandt said. “What does the NRC report confirm for me? It confirms that we have an exceptional faculty and we’re attracting great students.”
The analysis offers departments an opportunity to evaluate strengths and weaknesses against performances nationwide.
Brandt said it was too early to discuss changes that might arise from the report’s data, but he has already begun discussing the results with individual departments.
Timothy J. Colton, chair of the Government Department, emphasized that despite the strong showing—the department’s doctoral program was ranked number one—there was more work to be done.
“You have to pedal heard to keep your place in the line of riders,” he said. “There are no grounds for complacency.”

Dunster House library books are now free for perusal thanks to the removal of brass bars that previously ran across the library shelves.
The bars, which were installed last fall and elicited criticism from some House residents, were always meant to be a temporary measure while the House catalogued the library’s collection, according to Dunster’s Allston Burr resident dean Carlos E. Diaz Rosillo.
“We wanted to make sure we knew which books we had,” he said.
Over the summer, a former undergraduate in Dunster began the cataloguing process, according to Diaz Rosillo. The bars were removed before the academic year began, and a group of undergraduates hired as library staff will continue cataloguing the books throughout the semester.
In response to criticism of the installation of the bars, Dunster House Masters Roger B. and Ann Porter said last year that the move was the result of security concerns and uncertainty regarding the value of the book collection.
Diaz Rosillo said that the cataloguing process has identified one high-value collection so far and that such items may be placed in a more secure area, perhaps behind a glass barrier.
Within the library, four wooden shelves—two along the perimeter adjacent to a fireplace and two stand-alone shelves behind armchairs—are protected by glass. Those shelves contain books pertaining to Harvard’s history, including a biography of Increase Mather, diaries of notable historical figures, and various philosophical works.
Diaz Rosillo referred specific questions regarding the collections and measures that will be taken to protect them to the House Masters. Roger Porter declined to comment, and Ann Porter did not return a request for comment.
The installation of the silver brass bars, two of which ran across the shelves in the library, caught students by surprise last year. Many complained about the lack of student input and others said that restricting access to books contradicts the purpose of a university.
In an interview last September, Ann Porter said that the decision to place the bars was caused by an alumnus alerting the Masters that some elements of the library’s collection were of some value.
But that decision—and the lack of involvement in a decision that Ann Porter said took place over the summer—elicited criticism over the House e-mail list.
While some students who said they used the library more as a study space than a source for books expressed indifference over the removal, others said they were pleased with the final outcome.
Sarah J. Johnson ’11, who sent an e-mail about the bars over the House list last year criticizing the move, wrote in an e-mail that she was “delighted” that the bars had been removed—a sentiment echoed by fellow Dunster resident Michael A. Baskin ’11.
“The library now reflects the open and inclusive community of Dunster House,” he said.

Again the Ivy League’s lone representative at the Golfweek Conference Challenge, the Harvard women’s golf team returned to the national event this weekend hoping for a repeat of last year’s top-seven performance.
But after the Crimson’s 13th-place finish in the tournament’s 18-team field, it is clear that the squad still has a ways to go before returning to the level of play that earned it four wins last season—and not to mention two out of the last three Ivy titles.
“Last year was a particularly good finish—our tie for seventh in that field was as good as we played all year,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It’s easy to want to compare to that, but I thought if we’d had a very good tournament [this year], we would finish around 10th. To finish 13th is not terribly different, given the caliber of competition.”
Competing Sunday through yesterday on the Fazio Course at Red Sky Golf Club in Vail, Colo., the Crimson put together a three-round total of 940 (310-314-316), 74 strokes over par.
“We didn’t play as well as I would have liked us to, but we showed some signs of improvement from last week,” Rhoads said. “It doesn’t look like that from our scores, but that’s not representative of how difficult the golf course was.”
Virginia took home the overall prize with a 13-over 877, edging pre-tournament favorite Arizona by six strokes. Cavalier sophomore Brittany Altomare medaled with a four-under 212.
Harvard freshman Bonnie Hu continued the sparkling start to her collegiate career, leading the Crimson with an 11-over 227 (73-79-75). The rookie’s strong showing placed her in a tie for 30th among the 90-member field.
“I was hitting the ball pretty well, and my putting was decent,” Hu said. “I kind of struggled the second day, but other than that I played pretty well.”
Hu was also Harvard’s top scorer at last week’s Princeton Invitational.
“She hits it pretty far, she hits it pretty high, she’s quite accurate, and she’s a good putter as well,” Rhoads said. “She really doesn’t have weaknesses, and that type of game tends to travel quite well.”
Junior Christine Cho—the reigning Ivy Player of the Year—turned in another solid trio of rounds, six strokes behind Hu with a 233 (76-77-80).
“It was a course that favored people who can hit it pretty far and pretty high, so she had to certainly make do with the fact that she doesn’t hit it as far as some of the longest hitters,” Rhoads said. “For what she had to work with, she did quite well.”
“The course was a little long for me,” Cho agreed. “I was just trying my best to save par and not get bogeys.”
“I actually wasn’t hitting it that great, so I saved a lot of strokes with getting up and down and making a lot of clutch par putts,” she added.
The play of classmate Jane Lee was also noteworthy, as the junior managed to submit the team’s third-best score, a 23-over 239 (80-79-80), despite having failed to qualify for last week’s event.
“She did great,” Rhoads said. “I was very pleased with her jumping in the lineup quickly and contributing right away.”
Harvard captain Mia Kabasakalis tied for 67th overall with a 241 (81-79-81), and rookie Fritzi Reuter rounded out the squad in 88th place after accumulating a total of 251 (84-83-84).
The par-72, 6,247-yard mountain course presented a unique challenge for the Crimson golfers, as it features an elevation difference of nearly 600 feet between its highest and lowest points.
“It’s a little bit different from normal clubbing situations,” Rhoads said. “The greens were quite firm and really undulating...it certainly favored those who were playing extremely well.”
And that phrase would not accurately describe the Crimson’s current state, after only two and a half weeks’ worth of practice to shake off the rust accumulated during summers filled with non-golf activities.
As a comparison, Harvard placed three competitors within the field’s top 30 at last year’s Conference Challenge.
More revealingly, the Crimson placed a disappointing sixth at the Princeton tournament two weekends ago.
“We’re still trying to exactly find our identity,” Rhoads said. “I thought that this fall would be a challenging fall for us...I didn’t think it would be quite this challenging at this point, but I tend to think things like this are good for a team.”
The next opportunity for Harvard to prove its coach right will come this weekend, when the squad heads to the Keystone State to compete in a tournament hosted by Penn State.

The Crimson swung its momentum in a new direction last night after it broke a seven-game losing streak with a five-set win over the University of New Hampshire, 25-22, 16-25, 25-10, 21-25, 15-6.
Women’s volleyball (3-10, 0-1 Ivy) hopes its victory at UNH (5-10), which defeated Dartmouth earlier in the season, will be a positive signal for the Crimson’s rematch against the Big Green on Friday.
According to junior co-captain Anne Carroll Ingersoll, the Crimson brought a distinct energy to last night’s match-up that the team had been missing in previous games.
“We celebrated the little successes we had in each point and in each game, and we allowed the energy to build on itself,” said Ingersoll, who led the team with 11 kills. “We got the big points, big blocks, big kills. It’s more fun to play with energy.”
Ingersoll noted this energy was clearly absent when Harvard played Dartmouth last Friday and will be a critical factor in this week’s rematch.
“We didn’t play our best. We had a lot more to give in that game,” Ingersoll said. “I know we should have beaten Dartmouth last week, but it was just more incentive to beat UNH.”
The Wildcats ran their offense to the left side of the court and implemented a unique rotation, both details which  could have posed potential threats to the Crimson.
Harvard’s setters, freshman Natalie Doyle and sophomore Beth Kinsella, were especially challenged when the team transitioned from its traditional 5-1 formation to a 6-2 to adapt to this unusual offense.
“[UNH] runs an unorthodox offense,”  coach Jennifer Weiss said. “We needed to keep them out of their system to avoid that. We worked on blocking to shut down their offensive system. Our blockers slowed down their attackers.”
The back-and-forth match began to the advantage of Harvard, which narrowly won the opening set, 25-22, but it was soon followed by a 25-16 response from the Wildcats in the second set.
UNH was then able to claim the first kill of the third set, but little else went its way, as the Crimson ran off 12 unanswered points.
“UNH is a very mental team,” Ingersoll said. “When they are playing well, they’re playing really well. We had a really long run in the third game and they obviously couldn’t get it together, but we didn’t look past them. We were mentally tougher.”
The fourth set tested the mental rigor of both squads, as it reached a deadlock at both 12-all and 21-all.
Harvard claimed several points during the set due to UNH errors, but even those, along with a notable kill by freshman Erin Cooney, were not enough to give it the set, as the Wildcats took the final four points.
According to Ingersoll, the Crimson then entered the final set with a revived energy and an attitude that allowed the girls to cruise to victory in the set and the match.
“It’s nice to finish a match in five,” Weiss said. “It’s a positive feeling for the team to be able to pull that out.”
“It was really exciting for us, especially since last season we had a lot of games that went to five, and we wouldn’t be able to pull out the win,” Ingersoll added.
The young team has been making gradual modifications to its strategies and lineup, which Weiss hopes will lead to a win on Friday.
“We had a tough preseason schedule, but [volleyball] is a game of momentum and we have a win under our belt going in [to the Dartmouth match],” Weiss said.
As far as specifics to these adjustments in Harvard’s strategy against the Big Green, Weiss was willing to reveal very little.
“You’ll just have to see on Friday,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing 32 minutes of water polo is a lot. Add on eleven minutes of gut-wrenching sudden-death overtime, and it begins to seem like an eternity.
Even before I hopped into the water last Saturday night, I could tell that it was not going to be your average Harvard men’s varsity water polo game.
We had fallen to Fordham earlier in the day in our first conference game of the season and were looking to bounce back in what seemed to be a do-or-die match-up against the Gaels of Iona College.
We knew that an 0-2 start to conference play would all but doom us to the bottom half of the division. Looking around the locker room, I sensed a certain energy in the room, a feeling of urgency that wasn’t normally there.
Iona scored first, and memories of the morning’s game flashed in my mind. Would we just roll over and let the Gaels take this one?
But we fought back, tying the score at one on an extra-man goal by senior Alex Thompson.
The game went back and forth, yet the Gaels proved stronger over the first three periods, holding an 8-5 lead going into the fourth.
When we came over to the bench after the third quarter, our coach Ted Minnis had just one thing to tell us.
“Three-goal deficit? This is nothing,” he said. “You guys came back from five last week.”
Our offense stepped up to the plate in a big way during the final period. We scored two quick goals, and after an Iona score that extended its lead to 9-7, junior Mike Katzer powered the ball into the back of the net, cutting the deficit to one.
After a strong defensive stand, I ended up with the ball, and dropped it in to captain Bret Voith right in front of the goal. He rose up out of the water and tied the game with a shot that rocketed into the far side of the cage.
In water polo, overtime consists of two three-minute periods, and if necessary, as many three-minute periods of sudden death as needed to have a winner.
The first overtime period was scoreless, and with 30 seconds left in the second overtime, Iona called a time-out.
Its goalie came out to half-pool to pass the ball, and on the referee’s whistle, he threw it long into the hands of one of our players, who then passed the ball back to our junior goalkeeper, Alex Popp.
From the bench, I could see Alex holding the ball and eyeing the other goal, which had been left open after the opposing goalie had come out to half-pool.
“Don’t shoot, Alex; please don’t shoot,” were the only thoughts going through my mind. Just as I looked away for a second, I saw the ball flying towards the other goal, and to the amazement of everyone on the bench (and in the stands), it went in!
The entire bench went crazy—we couldn’t believe that our goalie had just scored. I thought for sure that the game was just about wrapped up, since there were only 18 seconds remaining.
But Iona’s relentlessness paid off, and the Gaels pushed down the pool and scored only 10 seconds later. Talk about a letdown.
In the first sudden-death period, as the shot clock was winding down, junior Kevin DiSilvestro passed the ball over to Voith in front of the goal in a last-ditch attempt to make something out of a possession that seemed to be amounting to nothing.
Voith went up to grab the ball and was pulled down by the opposing player, and the referee awarded our team with a penalty shot. The opposing coach went absolutely ballistic, screaming, “A five-meter? You’re going to give him a five-meter for THAT?”
The referee gave the coach a red card, and a security officer came down and escorted him out of the pool. Since Iona didn’t travel with an assistant coach, its bus driver came down and took over coaching duties for the remainder of the game.
In water polo, a penalty shot is similar to those in soccer, where a player is given the chance to take a undefended shot from a line only five meters away from the goal.
I have a custom of swimming to the other side of the pool and facing our goalkeeper when one of my teammates shoots a penalty shot. Maybe it’s superstition, but for whatever reason, I just cannot watch my team take penalty shots.
Voith lined up in front of the cage with the ball, and with my back to him, I heard the referee’s whistle. Then a loud clink. Iron. No goal.
The first sudden death ended with the same score with which it had begun. The second period of sudden death, which was the fourth overtime period of the game, started just as uneventfully as the last had finished. With just under a minute remaining, an Iona player made a seemingly harmless pass into a player in front of the cage, and…I saw the shot hit the netting in the back of the goal, and my mind just went blank.
We had lost. Emotionless, we shook hands with the other team, and I found myself just walking around the deck, as if I was waiting to start the next quarter of play. It couldn’t believe that it was over, just like that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fans of college sports know that injuries are something that every team must deal with over the course of a season. With that being said, the Harvard women’s soccer team has been plagued by more than its fair share of ailments, as only three players have managed to start all eight games for the Crimson.
From missing its leading goal scorer to its starting goalkeeper, the Crimson has had to deal with health issues all this season. But things are beginning to look up for Harvard heading into the heart of Ivy League play.
For one, after it started the season with just one healthy returning starter, the Crimson’s defense is finally starting to resemble the 2009 edition that won the Ivy League championship. Sophomore defender Taryn Kurcz is back after missing the first five games of the season while senior Katie Kuzma—who is also a Crimson sports editor—saw the field for the first time this year in the squad’s fifth game. Since their return to the field, Harvard has gone 2-1.
Offensively, Harvard has also gotten back the services of some of its top producers. Co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh—the team’s leading goal scorer from 2009—missed the Crimson’s third and fourth games with a minor injury, but has since returned. In her four games back, Sheeleigh has tried to make up for lost time, recording three goals and two assists.
Freshman Peyton Johnson has also had success in her two games back since being sidelined for contests against Boston University and Rhode Island, as she scored a goal in Harvard’s 3-2 win over UMass last Sunday.
But Harvard is still missing a key component of its team—sophomore goalie AJ Millet. After starting in net for the Crimson in its first four contests, Millet went down with an undisclosed injury in practice prior to the team’s Sept. 16 match-up against Boston University.
Freshman Jessica Wright has filled in for Millet, helping Harvard go 2-2 in its past four contests, but the squad hopes it can have Millet back in time for its Ivy League contest against Yale this Saturday.

West Coast investors beat the East Coast in a brutal showdown of endowment fund management. That is, according to Bloomberg News, Stanford University’s endowment outperformed both Harvard and Yale with a higher return on its investments. Stanford saw a rise of 14.4 percent opposed to Harvard’s 11 percent and Yale’s 8.9 percent.
“Our investment managers took advantage of strong equity and credit markets through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, allowing us to make up some of the ground lost in fiscal 2009,” John Powers, chief executive officer of Stanford Management Co, told Bloomberg.
While coming in second may feel foreign to us here in Cambridge, the 11 percent increase is still a sight for sore eyes. Just two years ago Harvard faced heavy losses and moved to make significant budget cuts.
And, as always, it’s nice to know that Harvard still beats Yale at everything.

With the release of “The Social Network” just two days away, the Internet and Harvard undergraduates are abuzz as they try to find some insight into screenwriter Aaron Sorkin’s new biopic about Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
On Harvard Time landed an interview with the famous screenwriter. During the interview, Sorkin admits to feeling a sense of kinship with Zuckberg, saying that he “relate[s] to him a lot” and that he has “a lot of affection and respect for him.” Besides a few serious questions, watch for a fidgety and awkward Jesse Eisenberg, who plays Zuckerberg.
The Harvard Lampoon released a parody of the film’s trailer, which satirizes Zuckerberg as power hungry and a bit crazy. In the parody trailer, the main character, who seems to be played by Tom Green, manically connects the dots of faces on a shoddy world map. Then, he raises his arms into the air and bellows, “That’s six billion eight hundred million people. I’ve connected everyone in the entire world!”
A former Harvard undergrad penned an article for Vanity Fair’s website about the new film, in which he argues that almost every character is an “asshole.”
