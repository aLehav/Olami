After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a sharp departure from its kaleidoscopic and sensual first season, the “Euphoria” special episodes, released over the past two months, focus on the show’s two central characters Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (Hunter Schafer). Since both pieces are grounded in a specific space — a diner for part one and a therapist’s office for part two — their cinematography is quite stationary and, at times, incredibly claustrophobic. It’s a radical change from the dynamic, ever-changing, phantasmagoric style that makes “Euphoria,” well, “Euphoria.” Whereas Part One features Rue and Ali’s back and forth after the incident with Jules at the train station and Rue’s relapse, the second and most recent release spotlights Jules as she uses the Christmas holiday to reflect on the past year — thus, for the first time in the show’s short history, telling the story from a perspective other than Rue’s. This episode markedly improves on the first special episode, which was almost exclusively conversation, opting for flashbacks and imaginative dream sequences to provide closure and set up the forthcoming second season. Still, the episode centers around too much sitting around and talking to be engaging for an audience used to swirling pans and frenetic visual collages.
Up until this episode, Jules is the new girl in town, carrying herself well as she navigates the suburbs with optimism and strength. As this episode shows, the last season was only skimming the surface of her character. In this episode, we drop into deep water and are given a window into Jules’ mind. Over the course of 45 minutes, she reveals parts of herself a bit at a time — peeling away, as she would say, “the million layers of not me.”
The writing smoothly integrates Jules’ hyper-casual speaking style with subject matter she hasn’t broached before, making for a natural delivery. For example, when Jules is discussing the proclivity of girls to take down other girls and the constant lingering, analytical female gaze, she follows with “it would be a kind of sensual experience if it weren’t so fucking terrifying.” In true Jules fashion, notions of gender identity, self-criticism, and motherhood are all explored through the lens of her experiences with her transition, lack of female friendship, soul connection with Rue, and fraught family relationships. Whenever things get too heavy, she slips a joke or curse in. The give-and-take between the heavy and light helps build up and mediate tension, throwing the viewer out of balance and bringing everything back to center again.
The cinematography asserts an exclusive focus on Jules and her inner world. The piece starts with a close-up, a painful expression painted on her face. A simple prompt from an off-screen voice leads to a gorgeous sequence where the frame is just Jules’ eye, her iris superimposed with a montage of images from the past six months since her move. Tears well in her eye just as it cuts back to her face. It’s not until we are six minutes in that the camera reveals to us the source of the gentle yet prying questions: a therapist seated in a plush chair a few feet away from her. The camera doesn’t linger on them for long before cutting back to Jules, often with tight shots that force us to pay attention to every facial change and to ruminate on the thought that caused it.
Jules’ thinking out loud throws certain moments from the past season into sharp relief — most importantly, the night she boarded a train without Rue after drunkenly fantasizing about them running away together. This Rue-Jules scene and the others brought up were no doubt important to the first season’s narrative, but the way they are brought under the microscope here tips the balance among all of the show’s characters in their favor, making it the series’ central arc. What felt like a rollicking journey through various disparate, yet helplessly intertwined, teenage lives, now feels collapsed into a backdrop for a friendship-turned-romance, which honestly didn’t even last as long as the fallout from both sides would suggest. It’s possible that the directors are trying to make a statement about the way the self changes when it is free to be fully vulnerable, but they do so at the expense of the tangled nature of “Euphoria.”
Thankfully, some relief from the claustrophobia comes in the form of Jules’ flashbacks and fantasies. When Jules mentions her texts with an online romantic interest that goes by the username “ShyGuy118,” we are shown the work of her erotic imagination during their relationship. When she discusses her growing love for Rue, she runs through all the moments when she wanted to kiss her, even before Rue made the first move. These non-diegetic sequences grow sinister as the session continues; at one point, after an imagined sequence of Jules and ShyGuy118 having sex, Rue glitches in and out of Jules’ vision like an apparition. In another example, Jules is panic-crying, and the camera pans down, perspective distorts, we catch the frame of a mirror, and then the frame stills on Rue’s body, motionless, on the floor.
Though the episode is, at first glance, a conversation, it uses Jules' therapy session to lay bare her deepest thoughts and fantasies and give space to process the complexities of her transition to the suburbs. The episode was co-written and co-produced by Schafer alongside series creator Sam Levinson, and their script and production delved into Jules' trans identity and experience with new depth and immersive visuals. At the same time, the episode is still seemingly about 60% an average therapy session. Even as it wraps up some loose ends from Season One, it comes across as a mediocre result of a production team impatient to get the show more screen time in an indefinitely paused world, at the expense of the momentum for the show’s highly anticipated second season.

José G. Olivarez ’10 is an award-winning poet and son of Mexican immigrants. His debut book of poems, “Citizen Illegal,” was a finalist for the PEN/Jean Stein Award and a winner of the 2018 Chicago Review of Books Poetry Prize. He is the co-editor of the poetry anthology “The BreakBeat Poets Vol. 4: LatiNEXT.” His work has been featured in The New York Times, The Paris Review, and elsewhere.
The Harvard Crimson: What made you want to be an author, and a poet more specifically?
José Olivarez: I wanted to become a poet because poetry was the first genre of literature and writing community that made space for me and my stories. So I always read a bunch, but it wasn’t until I encountered poetry, and specifically spoken word, that I saw that there was a space for me and my stories about my family and everything else.
THC: A lot of your writing concerns themes of immigration and family. How do you approach writing about these really personal subjects?
JO: When I'm writing about subjects that are really personal, but also very big, I want to make sure that I have total conviction in what I'm writing. Because I think when we're talking about big subjects — whether it's race, immigration, class identity — there are ways that we can come to regurgitate stories that may be harmful to us.
So I want to make sure that I’m investigating where these stories come from. And do I actually want to say this? Do I actually believe this? And then the other thing is… I try to read broadly about what I'm writing and what interests me, so that I can understand a little bit better how my story kind of fits in as to what other people are writing?
THC: I wanted to know what your creative process is like, for writing poetry. Where do you get your inspiration?
JO: I love to read all sorts of things. As I'm reading, I'm kind of looking to see how the author is doing what they're doing… And then the other thing that I'm doing is, I'm trying to figure out what word, what story, what image can help me get underneath what I'm talking about. So, for example, with immigration… if I try to review the policy set forth by the United States government, it's hard to find the poetry in that. But if I start with a word or an image from when my parents were undocumented, and how they were navigating that experience, then it might help me come up with something that that does the job of reviewing that policy more effectively.
I'm trying to find the connection. I'm trying to find language that helps me figure out exactly what I want to say. Because with poetry, I think there's always what we think we know. And then underneath that there's something else. There's a reason why we study what we study, right? And so for me, part of that is understanding that, yes, I think some people would say I write about immigration, but I'm also writing about my family. I write about immigration so I can get closer to understanding my family, and how we came to be in the United States with each other.
THC: After publishing “Citizen Illegal” and “LatiNEXT,” can you speak to some of the differences in putting together an original poetry collection versus editing an anthology?
JO: With writing an original poetry collection, there's a little bit more control because that was my book, and it was my vision for the project. With the BreakBeat Poets volume for “LatiNEXT,” there were two other editors: Willie Perdomo and Felicia Chavez. And so, that was a much more collaborative project, which was a really a joy, to get to hear from them and think about, from their perspective, what was important for them in tackling the project, which was about kind of bringing together a chorus of Latinx poets to help us better question and understand this idea of Latinidad.
So the big difference is the collaborative aspect. But also, I think that, in between the time when I wrote “Citizen Illegal” and when we were working on “LatiNEXT,” my political ideas changed a little bit. And my aesthetic might have changed a little bit. I think one way to read “Citizen Illegal” is as a Mexican nationalist text, which-- it's not about Mexico being superior to the United States or the other way around. It's that all of these states have flaws. And so, I think, in “LatiNEXT,” there's a little bit more critique to it, maybe more than in my first book.
THC: What are you planning to work on next? What are you working on now?
JO: I'm working on two projects right now. One is a collaboration with a photographer in Phoenix who is a really great photographer. And he has these photos that I think showcase this kind of meeting place of male identity and also tenderness and love. Like this kind of machismo, although we're going to try and frame the book a little bit differently than that. But there's a point that shows the tenderness and care of Mexican men in families. So one project is like a collaboration: a bunch of photos, a bunch of poems.
And then, the other one is kind of the follow up to “Citizen Illegal.” I find myself kind of thinking about class a lot more. And I think, partly, that's because my class identity has been changing in some ways. And so, I've been grappling with that: how to make sense of myself, when I'm still carrying all the stories from my parents and from where I come from, but now I find myself in very different rooms.
It was also inspired by a Zoom reading with Kenyon University, and they were asking me about how to write stories beyond the typical kind of personal statement. When you're putting together your admissions packet for college or grad school or whatever, they ask you to frame those stories in particular ways. And so: How do we write our stories in ways that are not just about making them consumable, or sellable to people with more power and money, right? What else can we do with those stories beside selling them in that way? Those are some of the questions that I'm thinking about.
THC: How has Covid-19 impacted any of your creative projects?
JO: It feels very difficult to work some days because I'm so drained from worrying about my parents and my brothers. I have one brother who works in a factory, so I'm always texting him to make sure he feels okay. I just find that it's been hard to figure out a routine. So, for me, it's been really hard to be creative. I’ve still been writing, but it's a little bit more slower and sporadic than it usually is. I think that's because I'm someone that really benefits from having routine. And now it just feels like I have much less of a routine now.

On Dec. 4, 1969, Fred Hampton, the charismatic chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, was assassinated by the Chicago Police Department and the F.B.I. On Feb. 1, 2021, writer and director Shaka King premiered a stunning portrait of the chairman at the Sundance Film Festival. Featuring “Get Out” star Daniel Kaluuya as Chairman Fred, “Judas and the Black Messiah” is a gripping, honest depiction of the Black Panther Party of the late '60s.
The film touches on themes of Black power and dissent, police brutality and racism, self-preservation and solidarity — all made more resonant by their continued relevance today. Shot in grainy, warm-toned footage, “Judas and the Black Messiah” leans into the vintage aestheticism of the ‘60s while its perennial themes anchor the film to the current political moment. Though introduced in part through archival footage and historic reenactments, the film is tied firmly to the realities of the present, as the Movement for Black Lives and the pandemic continuing to expose the many injustices the Panthers fought against for decades.
The film follows Fred Hampton who, by the age of 21, had already grown to prominence in the national party movement and in his home base of Chicago. A skilled orator and organizer, the chairman demanded power to the people and inspired a growing movement of solidarity and calls for radical justice — all of which lead the FBI to brand him as a threat, planting informant William O’Neal (played by Kaluuya’s “Get Out” co-star LaKeith Stanfield) to target Chairman Fred and infiltrate the Panther party.
“Judas and the Black Messiah” paints a compelling portrait of Chairman Fred’s legacy while also centering the man who became infamous for his betrayal. King convincingly humanizing O’Neil into someone audiences can sympathize with on some level, even while the character’s treasonous storyline plunges him deeper into irredeemability.
Kaluuya’s Chairman Fred, on the other end of the spectrum, is larger than life, a portrayal that thus does justice to the chairman’s own trailblazing legacy. Where Stanfield’s O’Neal is unsure of his place in the world, Kaluuya’s Chairman Fred could not be more certain of his calling to serve the people. Embodying the ever-natural leader, Kaluuya’s performance is impeccable, charismatic, compelling, and loving. Indeed, the film’s most powerful moments are those in which King positions Chairman Fred center stage, whether that be in depictions of the Panther rallies where Chairman Fred would inspire others to take up the fight against “the pigs,” or in the more intimate betrayal. King makes evident the systems of oppression that plagued both, while also drawing out the contrasts between Chairman Fred and O’Neal, who in many ways serve as foils to one another. Chairman Fred, for example, lived his life for the people, while O’Neal is shown to work for self-preservation alone.
In a film so laser-focused on restoring the legacy of the Black Panthers, King deliberately uplifts the work of Chairman Fred and the Panthers, who were vilified by the FBI and federal government for decades. Notably, King does so while refusing to filter their rhetoric or their call to direct action for the sake of appeasing white audiences. King is clear in representing the deep harm that racism causes (the police officers, for example, are shown to target, brutalize, and kill the Black Panthers without hesitation), while also providing some hope in the fact that these systems could be dismantled.

Within the first minute of “The Fall of the House of Usher,” viewers know to expect the unexpected — they see the production’s opening image of the bottom half of a seemingly masculine form in a suit, only for the camera to pan upward to reveal a woman discussing gender, dolls, and emotional intelligence.
The production, now streaming on the Boston Lyric Opera’s website through operabox.tv, is a creative and otherworldly venture in virtual theater. Presenting Philip Glass’ operatic rendition of Edgar Allen Poe’s short story of the same title, this show combines hand-drawn and stop-motion animation styles with archival television footage to curate three interlocking storylines inspired by the source text. The 90-minute pre-recorded production is accompanied by a series of interactive materials available online, providing a defined space for audiences to engage with the story in the absence of a physical theater.
The original story’s Gothic atmosphere pervades the show, allowing audiences to fully immerse themselves in its mystique. Though the constantly shifting modes of storytelling make the opera feel like a fever dream, this effect feels intentional due to repeated symbolism and the careful pairing of imagery and the music — like when a character is caught riding his horse in a raging storm, the intensity is amplified by a particularly dramatic swell in song. The feverishness reflects the overall narrative of the show; when watching these dream sequences, audiences feel that they themselves are in a dreamlike state, furthering the surrealist nature of the piece and blurring the line between fact and fantasy.
This delightful chaos also stems from the different layers of the show: the original Poe tale, represented by the stop-motion animation; the experiences of Luna, a young immigrant girl in a detention center on the United States-Mexico border, stylized through hand-drawn animations; and a series of interspersed television clips. While the non-sequential footage doesn’t supply the same fullness of narrative as the other two modes do, they amplify the emotions and conflicts of the production’s other layers, such as when Luna’s mistreatment in the detention center is interspersed with news clips of anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests. By representing the events of the original tale as imagined scenes within Luna’s mind, the show raises important questions about belonging, familial relationships, and mental health, such as who gets to belong within the narrative of the American Dream, and at what cost?
For the first half of the show, it remains unclear how these distinct narrative lines tie together. While the uncertainty is frustrating at times, the haziness of these relationships adds to the surrealism of the show. If viewers are willing to allow this production to defamiliarize and unsettle — which it accomplishes to great effect — then they can expect an impactful, if ambiguous, theatrical experience. The strength of this eerie show lies in its form and style, which allow the audience to come to their own conclusions about what the show means.
The clearly conveyed tone of the show succeeds because the production quality of “The Fall of the House of Usher” constantly amazes. At the heart of the opera is a stellar cast of emotive singers and actors — directed by James Darrah and conducted by David Angus — whose rich and resonant voices lend themselves neatly to the chilling and otherworldly musical atmosphere of the work. Engaging visuals complement the music and narration, with each distinct medium of film beautifully stylized, from the ethereal stop-motion ghosts of the House of Usher to the nostalgia-inducing clips of ‘50s backyard parties to the unsettling hand-drawn depictions of Luna’s isolating nightmares. These ever-changing aesthetics, crafted by a team of seven art and photography directors, designers, and animators, add a constant sense of movement to the piece, keeping audiences on the edge of their seats throughout.
Though these elements of the production are pre-recorded and edited to perfection, the show retains a critical element of interactivity to keep it balanced on the line between film and theater. The Boston Lyric Opera website features an interactive tour of the famed House of Usher, outfitted with nods to the piece’s most important symbols, bits of Edgar Allen Poe’s poetry and personal history, and even a video with screenwriter Raúl Santos (who devised the production’s interwoven narratives) discussing the process of making the show. Additionally, audience members are invited to contribute directly to this artistic project by writing their own brief addition to a “community gothic short story,” which viewers are able to read upon the story’s completion. With these opportunities for further audience immersion, the BLO successfully crafts enticing and unique mythos around the show, creating something that continues to exist after the show’s virtual curtains close.
The combination of the show’s creative storytelling, beautiful design, and immersive opportunities to engage with the opera's world lures viewers into engaging deeply with the work, which is all too rare for virtual theater. With the opportunity to not only watch but also contribute to the work of theater, “The Fall of the House of Usher” gives audiences a refreshing and innovative online theatrical experience.

Where are the boundaries between adjacent literary forms? When does prose become poetry, poetry become song, song become theater? These bounds are collapsing as contemporary artists experiment. Though this phenomenon is far from new, its newfound mainstream acceptance is a powerful testament. Exemplifying this trend, poet Amanda S. C. Gorman ’20 has dramatically increased in popularity since performing “The Hill We Climb,” which displays this intermingling of art forms through its theatrical structure and performance. The popularity of Gorman and her poetry has increased to such a degree that she is preparing to be the first poet to perform during the Super Bowl halftime show.
Gorman bridges the divide between the poetic and the theatrical, treating discrete poetic sections like acts and delivering the piece as though it were a theatrical performance. This lengthy poem reads like a rhapsody, with disparate poetic structures spanning many forms. She follows traditional structures of poetry across the various sections of this poem. There are moments with their own distinct meter, enjambment, anaphora, allusion, and alliteration, among other distinctly poetic devices. Gorman slips in, out of, and between these forms; she introduces and concludes various rhyme schemes; she takes listeners on a journey with this one expansive poem. Yet, she weaves a throughline between these distinct pieces by echoing the ideals of progress and hope for the future.
A lot of poetry finds beauty in its freedom from rigidity. However, while the distinction between prose and poetry was traditionally drawn by rhyme schemes and meter, free verse pushed the bounds of this definition. Poetry has its roots in the oral stories that predate written language itself, and yet poets were still able to innovate within this subcategory with the creation of slam poetry, utilizing performance not to emphasize meter, structure, and rhyme but to most adequately express the intensity of the emotions behind a piece.
The definition of poetry is constantly in flux as poets develop new ways to express themselves — and ultimately the core of poetry is that focus on vigorous expression of emotion and idea. By embracing elements of theater, speech, and other live performance forms, Gorman follows this trend, pushing poetry to its extremes, mingling with other art forms, and delivering a passionate performance in an effort to best express ideas of hope and progress.
This ambiguation of form plays with our standard conception of how to categorize art in the first place. Gorman’s poetry invites us to read speeches like poems and poems like plays, to understand that art should be interpreted as a standalone work instead of being judged against and confined within the bounds of its form. This effect gives artists permission to assert and express themselves beyond conventional bounds, and gives consumers the chance to interpret each individual piece in and around the form it's situated within.
Amanda Gorman’s work powerfully demonstrates the value of divorcing art from contextual expectation. Who says that the halftime show must be a song? Or the most powerful and memorable inaugural addresses be the speeches? Who says a song or a speech isn’t already poetry? These questions allow artists to let their art grow organically and speak for itself. Art should be able to breathe without restraint; Relying on inflexible definitions of form only hinders expression.

The business model of Spyce — the new, automated eatery in Harvard Square, where robots customize and cook your food — seems to be to minimize the need for human employment. In a country where employment is so intimately tied to dignity, where healthcare is considered a privilege, and the phrase ‘social safety net’ can be a dirty word, we find such a model troubling.
It’s important to lay the facts out there. Spyce, the futuristic restaurant founded by four MIT graduates, does employ some humans. Two in-house tasks seem to be left un-automated. Though Spyce’s “Infinite Kitchen” handles all the cooking, plucking various ingredients from refrigerators to a spinning counter where it cooks and tosses them, a human ultimately hands off your order and maintains the kitchen’s machinery. So at least one person is in the restaurant, working in concert with the cooking machine that is the store’s heartbeat.
The fact is that Spyce’s near-complete automation leads it to employ fewer workers than a traditional restaurant would. Spyce claims this allows employees to have “fulfilling” roles instead of “monotonous” ones, but many people do not work for enjoyment. They work to make money. Those monotonous jobs pay the bills, and as much as an employee deserves a fulfilling role, meeting needs like sufficient food and housing can enable a fulfilling life outside of work. Waitressing and working as a cook are common means to these ends, and these jobs are nothing to scoff at.
Spyce's selling point is its remarkable convenience. A made-to-order meal, ready in no time, that’s scrubbed the cooking process of as much human error as possible: miraculous, right? But we would gladly accept another Harvard Square restaurant over Spyce that, though less efficient, employed more people.
Marginal improvements to the eating experience aren’t worth embracing a business that, in its seeming pursuit of a utopian eating experience, puts being an employer last. Waiting in line for a meal (or better yet, calling ahead) isn’t that bad, but heralding the arrival of a Harvard Square business that, long term, will likely employ fewer people than nearly any other restaurant would, is.
The arrival of Spyce in Harvard Square isn’t occurring in a vacuum. A Forbes article published in 2020 boldly proclaiming that “Robotic Restaurants Are The Future” predicts automated kitchens like Spyce’s will become the norm. Robot chefs don’t get tired, which means you don’t need to hire multiple people to work shifts from a restaurant’s opening to closing. Robo-chefs also never need a pay-raise, or any pay at all, so automating labor obviously lowers operating costs. The pandemic has accelerated this trend as more operators have embraced robotic waiters and cooks over human ones.
As of 2020, there were roughly 15.6 million U.S. employees in the restaurant industry. When you consider that there’s a total of about 150 million employed people in the United States, you realize that automating kitchens and food service is no fringe issue: It’s a trend that will deeply impact an industry 10 percent of American workers use to put a roof over their heads. We don’t want to cheer it on.
You get a good feeling when you support a small business instead of shopping on Amazon because you know you are giving to a company that believes in itself, its community, and, more importantly, the employees who come from that community. People can see value in supporting businesses that, through creating jobs, might give those it employs a more comfortable life, but Spyce’s futuristic appeal obfuscates that tendency. Immense value lies in this potential to ease the burden of others. We wish the Harvard Square real estate where Spyce now sits went to a business with a model better suited to this end.
Spyce prides itself on efficiency, but we aren’t buying what it's optimizing for. For all the coolness of its tech, our deep belief that slight improvements in efficiency are never worth denying opportunities for human flourishing means we’ll never find Spyce palatable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students returning to campus for this spring semester will find many differences between the Harvard Square they left and the Harvard Square they return to. Even before the pandemic, the landscape of the Square was always shifting beneath our feet — but one recent addition to Brattle Street is stirring the pot in a different way than those that came before it.
A new restaurant, Spyce, is cooking up something new. The eatery’s founders engineered an elaborate automated kitchen that can produce healthy meals tailored to customers’ preferences. Spyce’s automated kitchen prioritizes efficiency and consistency and is designed to accommodate different allergens and dietary restrictions, making their meals accessible. And in a pandemic, fewer hands handling a meal seems like an obvious benefit.
Having Optimus Prime prepare your food bowl might sound too good to pass up. Yet Spyce’s arrival in the Square and its reliance on such large-scale, deliberate automation invites larger questions about the future of labor and human interaction.
The opening of Spyce in our backyard is indicative of a global shift away from human labor and towards automation. Put plainly, automation is everywhere — and we don’t expect it to slow down anytime soon.
Automation doesn’t get rid of all warm-blooded employees: Even Spyce kitchen hasn’t fully erased the need for good old human labor. The company still employs individuals in customer service and to maintain machinery, boasting that, thanks to their mechanical chef, they can actually focus on “engaging, fulfilling” roles rather than “monotonous tasks''. But the fact that employees need to be re-assigned at all suggests that some jobs, perhaps even restaurant cooks, will be chopped by improvements in technology and automation.
We’ve been here before — just take a look at the movie rental industry in the aftermath of on-demand video. But if automation might make certain jobs obsolete, radical technological advances can also bring great opportunity. Take Spyce — the reduced food production costs might lead to a wider accessibility of healthy, high-quality dishes at affordable prices, broadening its demographic reach. Because of Spyce (and the advent of the robot era), more people may have access to high-quality food in a community plagued by gentrification.
This same increase in efficiency and associated cost reduction might also allow for better benefits for those workers who are employed (Spyce, for one, is promising as much). Indeed, it’s possible the job losses might not turn out to be as drastic as it seems, representing more of a large shift from declining to dawning sectors rather than a zero-sum loss. Instead of cooking the food, workers might now be prepping the food, helping customers work a kiosk screen, or delivering meals.
Of course, those shifts might still affect individual people for significant stretches of time. That’s why, rather than try to stop the inevitable (and potentially beneficial) advance of automation, we should plan ahead to lessen the bumps along this road of economic transformation. In transitioning our labor market, we shouldn’t leave anyone behind — automation should serve the people, not the other way around. We must act preemptively to ensure that automation does not worsen pre-existing racial and gender inequities in employment.
A well-thought-out socioeconomic transition could offer an opportunity to fix systemic social issues. In fact, we already have some promising policy contenders. There’s the possibility of a tax on automation that would fund a variety of social programs like making public higher education free for all or equipping workers with the skills they need to succeed in this new labor market. Another proposal, popularized by 2020 Democratic presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang, is developing a universal basic income program or, as Yang dubbed it, a “freedom dividend”. It would guarantee a thousand dollar per month income for every American adult over the age of 18, aiming to eliminate U.S. poverty and offer a financial cushion for those jobs lost by automation at the same time.
There is a greater moral issue underlying automation we cannot ignore. We shouldn’t make the same mistake Dr. Frankenstein made when he created his monster, forging ahead in solitude without any outside deliberation or ethical contemplation. As Spyce opens for business in the Square, we need to remember that our societal discourse has to keep up with the pace of technological innovation.
Before we embrace or condemn the increasingly salient role of automation in our lives, we should consider the broader cultural implications of scientific advancements. What does it mean to belong in a society that prizes efficiency and perfection above all else? How does our “humanity” change with automation? What is the value of our imperfect, flawed, and individual humanity? We need to spend time chewing on these important questions now so we don’t choke on them later.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is a populist overtone to the recent frenzy surrounding GameStop and other recently-shorted stocks. This is about more than making money. It is about making the elites pay. Take one scroll through r/WallStreetBets on Reddit and you will see people reveling at the thought of obscenely wealthy Wall Street hedge funds losing billions to a rag-tag group of retail investors who beat them at their own game.
I think it is worth reminding us that Harvard University and its graduates are certainly within the scope of populist ire.
Although this recent movement sprouted out of a small corner of the internet in 2019, its roots span decades. Americans never forgave the reckless speculation of Wall Street nor the federal government’s decision to bail them out after the 2008 financial crisis. Ordinary people were suddenly struggling to keep a roof over their heads whilst corporations received billions to cover their losses, nearly all without so much as a slap on the wrist for causing the whole mess. But this problem runs even deeper than that.
Economic inequality has steadily risen since the 70s in America. For many adults, this economically divided world is the only one they know. Employment is increasingly dependent on college degrees, and colleges are increasing their price every year, to the point where spending decades paying off loans one could’ve taken out as a teenager is now commonplace. Rather than acknowledging this reality, older generations have called younger generations spoiled and sheltered. They have told younger generations that hard work, careful budgeting, and a self-starter attitude is all it takes to become rich. However, this couldn’t be farther from the truth.
Rich people live entirely different lives from everyone else. They increasingly attend private schools, are more likely to gain admission to Ivy League colleges bolstered by legacy status, college counseling, or a sizable donation, then can work the connections they were born with to get a cushy white-collar job. The disparities between the reality for the rich and everyone else have sown resentment which is beginning to fester.
Perhaps, this phenomenon can partially explain the rise of Donald Trump, who stoked the flames of outrage towards the establishment. That’s not to say that all the people buying GameStop stock are Trump supporters. After all, support for this movement seems to be coming from all across the political spectrum — from figures like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to Elon Musk to Ted Cruz. However, all these groups share a common motivation: stripping power from the institutions which have earned their distrust and return that power to the people.
Harvard accepts disproportionate numbers of wealthy applicants, it is known for funneling graduates into finance and consulting, and it has more millionaire and billionaire alumni than any other university. Yet, Harvard students are getting in on the populist action.
In class, I’ve heard discussions among students excitedly reporting their gains or exchanging strategies about when to buy and when to sell. My peers have co-opted the memetic language of r/WallStreetBets, spamming group chats with rocketship emojis and phrases like “to the moon” or “we like the stock”. Clearly, some of us view ourselves as part of this movement, not as its enemies.
Right now, we may not identify with the elites of Wall Street. As college students, we feel just as part of the masses as anyone else, still penny-pinching and working part-time jobs, still feeling the pressure of inadequacy that pushes us to constantly network and build our resumes. We are only at the beginning of our climb. But one day, many of us will reach the top and when we do, the ground may appear quite far away. It may become difficult to imagine a life without the connections and opportunities that attending Harvard has afforded us.
I urge my peers, especially those aiming for jobs in finance or politics, to take a look around at the anger of people claiming that the elites have robbed America; at the suffering of those who have lost their jobs or homes; at the desperation of people willing to gamble everything they have at a shot which seems once-in-a-lifetime to most. Remember, it was people who were once like us that caused these wounds.
Soon, we’ll likely be wielding the same power that our predecessors have abused. That power has a tainted legacy we must bring to reckoning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An external committee reviewing sexual harassment at Harvard found “pronounced power disparities” and “inadequate reporting mechanisms” at the University allowed decades of sexual harassment by former Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez to persist, according to its final report released Thursday.
The external review — commissioned in 2019 by University President Lawrence S. Bacow to investigate the circumstances that allowed Domínguez to sexually harass multiple women over four decades — found that the Government Department failed to take action “on known sexual harassment” and that the University did not adequately “monitor employees with past infractions.”
The report found that Domínguez’s harassment of women was “common knowledge” in the Government department and that Harvard insufficiently censured Domínguez, which enabled his misconduct to persist for decades.
Allegations that Domínguez sexually harassed at least 18 women from 1979 to 2015 surfaced in reports published by the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2018. Several days after the accusations were reported, Domínguez announced his retirement; Gay stripped him of his emeritus status and barred him from the FAS campus after a yearlong investigation.
“According to several sources, long before the Chronicle story broke, Domínguez’s harassment was a matter of common knowledge among some members of the Government Department,” the report states. “The Committee also found that the University’s failure to publicize the sanctions against Domínguez in 1983 led to underreporting of his subsequent misconduct.”
The report also posited that faculty gender imbalances in the Government Department contributed to underreporting of misconduct.
The report set forth nine recommendations split across three categories: encouraging reports of misconduct, ensuring more effective responses when misconduct is reported, and vetting candidates for leadership positions. The tenth recommendation — creating an anti-harassment culture — is meant to cut across all the categories.
Bacow wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates accompanying the report that the University accepted the recommendations and has asked the Title IX office to “accelerate” existing plans so that they are implemented.
In his email, Bacow apologized to former Government assistant professor Terry L. Karl, who filed the initial complaint against Domínguez, and all subsequent affiliates who faced instances of sexual harassment which “might have been avoided if Harvard had taken timely and appropriate actions.”
“Harvard failed her. She deserved better, and she and others suffered greatly as a result,” Bacow wrote.
“I deeply regret that she—and so many other members of our community—were made to feel that we turned our backs on them,” Bacow added. “Everyone deserves a fair process, and no one should ever again have to go to the same lengths to be heard.”
Deputy Provost Peggy Newell said in an interview with the Harvard Gazette that the University Title IX office is already working to incorporate the specific recommendations provided by the committee. She said the office is planning on creating an online “Gender Equity Data Hub” to provide more transparent information on disclosures, formal complaints, and outcomes.
President Emerita of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Susan Hockfield chaired the external committee, which also included New York University law professor Kenji Yoshino ’91 and University of Connecticut professor Vicki J. Magley.

Experts said that while early indicators of the success of Harvard Management Company’s “five-year” plan are promising, it will take years for the long-term impacts of the plan to become clear.
HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar embarked on an ambitious endowment restructuring plan upon taking the reins in 2016. The plan began with the mass layoff of roughly half of HMC's employees, and later included the “spinout” of multiple specialized investment teams in a move towards a generalized investment model, and various cost-cutting efforts.
Narvekar announced last week that the “five-year” plan had been completed in just under four years. In an email to University affiliates, Narvekar wrote that HMC is “comfortable” with the early results of the plan.
Harvard’s endowment returned 7.3 percent on its investments in 2020, bringing its total to $41.9 billion, the largest sum in its history. The returns defied grim outlooks that forecasted that Havard would see its endowment drop to the mid-thirties as a consequence of the coronavirus pandemic.
Rutgers Business School professor John M. Longo called the University’s 2020 return “very respectable,” comparing the 7.3 percent return to a passive investment strategy of investing 60 percent in more risky assets and 40 percent in less risky assets.
“The 7.3% return of Harvard endowment in the most recent fiscal year is very respectable,” Longo wrote in an email. “Although not exactly comparable, a low cost, 60% stock, 40% bond fixed income U.S. portfolio delivered a return of 6.7%.”
Longo wrote that Harvard’s generalist model allows the school to vary its investment strategy for its financial gain.
“No one firm or institution has a monopoly on investment talent. Harvard’s generalist model has the advantage of not being beholden to a single manager or single investment approach,” Longo wrote. “Rather, Harvard’s investment team may scour the world for best-of-breed investment managers across a range of asset classes.”
New York University professor David L. Yermack ’85, however, said that Harvard would benefit from a more passive investment strategy.
“What the major endowments have tended to do is look for exotic investments with very high fees in the belief that they’re going to do better than average,” said Yermack, a former Crimson Managing Editor. “They end up doing just as average as everything else, but then they get hit with the fees and they end up a couple percent behind the benchmarks.”
“Over time it’s really become a black mark on the University. The shortfalling of Harvard endowment is vastly bigger than the sheer size of almost every other endowment that’s out there,” Yermack added. “Every year I have this interview with different reporters from The Crimson and every year the situation gets worse.”
Harvard’s endowment has lagged behind several of its Ivy League peers in recent years, but its comparative returns have improved since 2019. In 2020, the endowment outperformed every Ivy League other than Dartmouth and Brown.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, referring to Narvekar’s comments in HMC’s fiscal year 2019 report.
“We are focused upon and aware that HMC generally takes lower risk and, therefore, will likely generate lower returns than many peers over a market cycle,” Narvekar wrote at the time. “The tradeoff is of course higher returns versus a less volatile revenue stream.”
Thomas D. Parker ’64, a former senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, wrote that university endowment investment differs from individual or institutional investing, and cautioned against comparisons and judgment based on annual performance numbers.
“The horizon is measured in centuries, not years or decades,” Parker wrote. “That timeline also makes insignificant the annual frenzy to compare endowment returns among the richer institutions.”

Soltan A. Bryce, a tutor in Mather House, will serve on the City of Cambridge’s LGBTQ+ Commission after being appointed to the position by City Manager Louis A. DePasquale on Feb. 1.
Established in 2004, the commission strives to “advocate for a culture of respect and monitor progress towards equality of all persons with regards to sexual orientation and gender identity,” according to its website. The commission’s 20 members are appointed to three-year terms.
Bryce — a second-year master’s in business administration candidate at Harvard Business School — said he often seeks out opportunities within the BGLTQ community. He currently serves as co-president of the PRIDE Club at the Business School, where he is one of just a few transgender students.
Bryce said he was “delighted” to be appointed to the city’s LGBTQ+ Commission.
“I think specifically what’s so cool about the commission is that it pulls together representatives in the community to focus on advancing the safety, health and equity of the LGBTQ+ community in Cambridge,” he said. “I’m really excited to focus primarily on learning. I think there are people who have been on a commission for a long time who have made incredible strides.”
Mather Resident Dean Luke A. Leafgren wrote in an email that the House is “so fortunate” to have Bryce as one of its resident tutors.
“We are so fortunate to have Soltan on our team at Mather, and we are thrilled for Soltan to be named to the BGLTQ+ Commission for the City of Cambridge,” Leafgren wrote. “This appointment demonstrates how resident tutors not only provide academic advising, programming, and a supportive presence in the Houses, but can also model careers of leadership and service.”
At Mather House, Bryce is a business, fitness, and BGLTQ tutor. He cited the many “learning moments” he has had with students, as well as their authenticity, as an inspiration to him.
“I think the students teach me as much as — probably more — than I necessarily am guiding them,” he said. “I’ve loved being able to add value back to the community. As we all look to be helpful in this world, to do it in a place where people are doing it in such different ways has been amazing.”
A self-described “big healthcare nerd,” Bryce also serves as Head of Growth at Plume, the first health technology startup dedicated to providing gender-affirming hormone therapy to transgender people around the United States.
He said he was inspired by the company’s “amazingly audacious goal” to develop a system of accessible care for trans individuals, created by trans individuals.
“We’re doing an unprecedented thing in an unprecedented time,” he said in a YouTube video about the startup last July. “We see ourselves in a line and sort of standing on the shoulders of giants and hoping to pass forward a torch towards a world where gender-affirming care is everywhere, at every health care facility.”
Bryce also noted the “design flaws” in the health care industry, which make it difficult for transgender individuals to receive the care they need.
“When you think about the actual information system in health care, or the way that patients are seen, documented, treated, and billed for, is that those systems were not designed with trans people in mind,” Bryce said. “How do we design systems — the healthcare system and more broadly, other institutions — to consider those who aren’t often thought about?”

Harvard University Dining Services workers who were laid off after HUDS closed facilities last month received the option to shift into new roles beginning Jan. 27, on seniority in an internal reshuffling process known as “bumping.”
Twenty HUDS workers are looking for new positions after the University closed four units, including the Culinary Support Group kitchen, which produced soups, sauces, salads, and pastas for the entire campus. Those workers can choose to either take an open position or “bump” a less senior HUDS employee out of their position and take their job, according to a procedure laid out in the contract between Harvard and UNITE HERE Local 26, which represents the University’s dining workers.
“Bumping is more or less the ‘no member left behind’ model for UNITE HERE Local 26,” union chief shop steward Laquiesha N. Rainey said. “It’s basically to ensure that those members don't end up terminated without a job. You want their seniority to count for something.”
According to Article 16 of the union contract, all HUDS workers have the right to “bump” other less senior employees out of their positions provided they have the correct qualifications. Employees bumped out of their jobs can subsequently bump workers of even less seniority, creating a “domino effect,” according to Rainey.
Rainey and three other Local 26 shop stewards — Aaron J. Duckett, John E. Hughes, and William A. Ridgley — said they believe everyone who wants to keep a job at HUDS will ultimately be able to do so, in large part because Harvard’s voluntary early retirement incentive program opened up dozens of positions.
“There are so many open jobs right now because people retired,” Duckett said. “This isn’t going to be a huge effect. At the end of the day, everybody will have a job.”
Starting Jan. 27, beginning with the most senior employee laid off, the University began sending affected workers lists of open positions and their hours and requirements, as well as a complete roster of HUDS workers according to seniority and work classification. Each worker gets to choose their new position. Once management confirms their eligibility for the job, the lists are updated and given to the next most senior worker affected.
“HUDS has been and continues to work closely with the Local 26 leadership through the bumping process as guaranteed by the union contract,” HUDS spokesperson Crista Martin wrote in an emailed statement.
Initially, many of positions opened up by early retirement were not offered to laid-off workers. Local 26, concerned that necessary jobs were not being filled and the lack of open positions would force more workers to bump, convinced HUDS management to offer some of the positions, according to Duckett.
“It took us a couple of weeks to get them to put those positions back on the list and make them readily available to members who were being laid off,” Rainey said.
Ridgley said HUDS workers, especially junior staff, are anxious about the bumping process and have asked him if they need to start looking for new work.
“We reassure them at this point we do have a surplus of hours,” Ridgley said.
More senior HUDS workers are also concerned about the reason the bumping process was launched in the first place, namely, the shutdown of the CSG kitchen.
“The reason why it’s happening is because they’re closing a unit they shouldn’t be closing, the central kitchen — the Culinary Support Group,” said Duckett, who formerly worked at the central kitchen. “It’s a major part of what we do.”
He added that workers are worried about what they see as an essential work unit being eliminated, which could set a precedent for future layoffs and outsourcing.
“Our biggest concern is ‘Who’s next?’” Duckett said.
The union filed a formal grievance with the University over the closure of the CSG kitchen on Dec. 18, 2020. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the grievance Thursday.

Johnson & Johnson filed for emergency use authorization Thursday for its newly-created Covid-19 vaccine — developed with researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School — after announcing results from its phase three clinical trials last Friday.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is now awaiting approval by the Food and Drug Administration, was reported to have a 66 percent efficacy rate in preventing moderate-to-severe infection and a 85 percent efficacy rate in protecting against severe infection from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The vaccine also was said to offer recipients “complete protection” against hospitalization and death, according to the company.
Dan H. Barouch ’93 — a professor at Harvard Medical School and the director of Beth Israel’s Center for Virology and Vaccine Research who has led design efforts for the vaccine alongside Johnson & Johnson since January 2020 — said the efficacy rates are high not only in the United States but also in Latin America and South Africa, where mutant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been reported.
“It’s the first time a vaccine efficacy study for Covid-19 has been conducted in the set in the modern era of the resistant viral variants that we’re hearing about,” Barouch said.
According to Barouch, the vaccines that are currently in use, including the shots developed by Pfizer and Moderna, were developed at a point in the pandemic before variants of the virus emerged.
Bruce D. Walker, founding director of the Ragon Institute, highlighted the continued importance of developing backup vaccines that will target variants of Covid-19.
“I think that we will see, even within the next two months, new trials starting that will be testing vaccines that are targeted not just to the original SARS-CoV-2, but also these more resistant variants,” Walker said.
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a relatively affordable, single-shot vaccine that does not require sub-zero freezing. Such traits distinguish it from other coronavirus vaccines and make it “ideal for global delivery,” per Walker.
“J&J has committed to making the vaccine available on a nonprofit basis,” Barouch said. “And it’s inexpensive.”
The vaccine will be available for distribution immediately after Johnson & Johnson receives emergency use authorization from the FDA, which is expected to occur within the next three weeks.
“Until we’ve vaccinated everybody, we're not really going to control the pandemic,” Walker said. “We’ve got to look at this as a global challenge that we all need to rise to meet.”

Legal scholars and experts discussed mobilizing and advocating for human rights and racial justice in a virtual panel at Harvard Law School on Thursday.
The event — titled “Human Rights, Civil Rights, and the Struggle for Racial Justice” — marked the second installment in a year-long series hosted by the Human Rights Program at the Law School.
Moderated by Aminta J. Ossom, a clinical instructor at the Law School’s International Human Rights Clinic, the event featured Gay J. McDougall, the scholar-in-residence at Fordham Law School; Nicole Austin-Hillery, the executive director of Human Rights Watch’s U.S. Program; and Maryum J. Jordan ’10, counsel for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law.
Ossom said in an interview that the series was inspired by discussions she heard after the murder of George Floyd in May.
“There were a lot of very interesting conversations that we were having,” Ossom added. “I just wanted to bring those discussions to the forefront and to allow people from different communities to have the conversations together, especially the human rights community.”
At the event, Austin-Hillery said human rights and civil rights are “inextricably linked” and cited racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd as an example of civil rights issues viewed as human rights issues.
“We didn't just see people in the United States rising up in the streets, we saw a transglobal movement,” she said. “That was because the language of human rights and civil rights is universal.”
Austin-Hillary cautioned against constructing systems that are made with the intention of assisting a certain group but ultimately serve to further disempower them.
“Sometimes when we point out what's wrong, and we start talking about what tools need to be used to fix it, oftentimes those tools are turned around and they're used against the same Black and brown people that we are working to protect, the disenfranchised people,” she said.
American exceptionalism poses a threat to the United States’ ability to hold systems and individuals in power accountable, Austin-Hillery argued.
“The same kinds of situations that happen in other parts of the world could very much happen here if we are not doing what we can to protect and uphold democracy,” she said.
Jordan described the need to prevent oppressive conduct — including the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and other acts of domestic terrorism — as a “balancing act,” particularly when it involves disenfranchised communities.
“We want to recognize the seriousness of these types of crimes,” Jordan added. “But also, we do not want a framework in which something that on paper sounds like it could be protective of communities is also used against the communities that people have in mind when we're thinking about who we are trying to protect.”
Austin-Hillery referenced research conducted at the Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organization that investigates and reports on human rights abuses worldwide, as proof of “far too little focus” on white nationalist groups, especially in comparison to other populations.
“They have to break down, get rid of the implicit bias that exists in favor of white people and start understanding and seeing that people who look just like them, have these capabilities and do have these histories and have to be monitored,” she said.
Jordan said that she hopes President Joe Biden's administration will increase access to basic human rights while also understanding the role that race plays in people’s lived experiences.
“I would love for policies to really establish stronger accountability for those who play a role in perpetuating these various human rights abuses,” she said. “But also, how the systems are extremely biased and how there's anti-Blackness and trying to get rid of that.”

As the University forges ahead with construction in Allston, some residents said they are worried about how the new projects — the Enterprise Research Campus and a development at 180 Western Ave. — will impact neighborhood stability and affordability.
Anthony P. D’Isidoro — a member of the Harvard-Allston Task Force and president of the Allston Civics Association — said that affordable home ownership is among his chief concerns.
Allston has a reputation of being a “transient community,” where people come for education and then move out to the suburbs to buy a home, according to D’Isidoro.
He said he hopes new developments will help “reverse these negative trends” and provide more “stability” in Allston.
“We need more home ownership opportunities,” D’Isidoro said. “We don’t need investors to come in; we need residents who are here for the long haul.”
Despite reviewing plans for the development as a member of the Task Force, D’Isidoro said he has not seen Harvard’s “long term vision” for “affordable home ownership.”
“If they’re serious about doing things to benefit our community, and to ensure long term viability and sustainability of our community, we would have missed out on a major opportunity, if they think it’s all going to be rental,” he said.
Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke wrote in an email that the University “actively supports” initiatives aimed at promoting “affordable and diverse” housing and homeownership opportunities throughout the region.
In 2019, the University recommitted $20 million to a project to augment affordable housing options in Greater Boston. In 2016, Harvard partnered with the All Bright Homeownership Program, an organization that promotes “homeownership stabilization through the use of deed restrictions,” per the program’s website.
Some members of the Harvard-Allston Task Force said they wanted to see the University push to increase the proportion of affordable units from the minimum of 13 percent, as mandated by zoning laws in Boston.
“What I would like to see is Harvard put money towards increasing the percent of affordable units through the city’s inclusionary development policy,” task force member Christine A. Varriale said.
“Everybody on the Harvard-Allston Task Force and everybody in the community that I’ve spoken to — they want 20 percent,” she added. “There shouldn’t be any wiggle room there.”
Aside from home ownership, D’Isidoro said he believes the pandemic will impact the desirability of the compact units at the 180 Western Ave. development.
“I still believe that all this polling that they did to look at compact living in the city was done before the pandemic, and a lot of young people said, ‘Yeah, if it results in better affordability, I can live in a 450-square-foot apartment,’” D’Isidoro said. “I think those feelings have changed because people want open space; people want balconies; people want larger kitchens, because they’re staying at home more.”
Brent Whelan ’73, a member of the task force who has lived in Allston for 40 years, said he noticed rent was increasing beyond the means of the “modest, solid working family.”
Whelan also said he believes the development at 180 Western Ave. does not cater to working-class families.
“Fairly expensive, residential rental structures that are mostly studio and one bedroom apartments. They’re therefore clearly intended for single adults or couples, but never families,” Whelan said.
“Even at the affordable rates, they will not be affordable for the people who have typically lived in Allston over the last couple of generations. And so it’ll continue this gentrification process,” he added.
In a meeting of the Harvard-Allston Task Force in January, developer Samuels and Associates said they could not determine a fixed rent price. Julia Wynyard, vice president of development at Samuels and Associates, said prices would be influenced by “market rate forces” at that time.
Harry Mattison, an Allston resident, said he questions whether the new housing developments will help Allston continue to be “diverse economically [and] diverse racially.”
“A good neighborhood has a mix of housing types for a mix of people,” Mattison said. “I think one of the disappointments about what Harvard has built so far in Barry’s Corner is just the price points are way out of reach for the vast majority of people.”
Nonetheless, D’Isidoro said he sees a bright future for Allston with the new developments, but only if there is also sufficient input from its residents.
“I’m more optimistic than most,” he said. “As long as we continue to have a very active and involved community in the process, I think things will turn out just fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of terrified New Yorkers fled the city, which had fast become an epicenter for the virus. Alexander Goldfarb had the opposite response.
The doctor immediately drove to Queens, New York, to treat patients at Elmhurst Hospital, which had been decimated by the virus and suffered a shortage of healthcare providers. He worked at the hospital for a week straight, intubating around six patients every night.
“All of this was a great risk to himself,” said Robert S. Brown ’59, a longtime colleague of Goldfarb’s. At the time, personal protective equipment was in short supply, but Goldfarb “cared about his patients and wanted to save lives.”
Months later, Goldfarb — an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School — was found dead while attempting to summit Pastore Peak in Pakistan. He was 57.
Goldfarb was first reported missing on Jan. 16 and found deceased on Jan. 18. Later that day, an initial attempt to retrieve his body was unsuccessful due to poor weather conditions, per a statement from the climbing company Asghar Ali Porik on Facebook.
His son, Levi J. Goldfarb, started a GoFundMe to raise funds for further search and rescue missions. As of Feb. 4, the fund had raised $100,000.
He described his father as “a tremendous athlete, a tremendous researcher, a fantastic physician, but at the same time someone who is so approachable and friendly and a kind-hearted person.”
Alexander Goldfarb grew up in the Soviet Union, and received his M.D. at Izhevsk State Medical Academy in 1986. He received his first Ph.D. in Numeric Methods in Medicine in 1992 at Central Institute, Transplantation and Artificial Organs.
After completing medical school, Goldfarb rose through the ranks in his town as a physician in the nephrology department, according to his son.
“He was the head of his department, he was published, he ran his whole wing of the hospital, and he wanted more,” Levi Goldfarb said. “He knew that in the U.S., the land of opportunity, he could achieve even greater things with his work ethic and with his talent.”
Alexander Goldfarb started looking for ways out of Soviet Russia in his late 20s and initially came to Louisville, Ky., where he worked as research fellow at the University of Louisville from 1992 to 1994.
He then served as a medical resident at The New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens from 1996 to 1999. He worked at Stanford University as a fellow in nephrology from 1999 to 2001 and received his second Ph.D. from the University of Utah in Biomedical Informatics in 2007.
Goldfarb later worked as a nephrologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2007 until 2018. As an assistant professor at HMS, he taught clinical medicine to medical students, interns, and residents at Beth Israel.
Goldfarb also was an established medical writer, with over 70 peer reviewed publications and books to his name. His most recent work, now in press, is the first critical care medicine book to include a chapter on Covid-19.
Brown said he will remember Goldfarb most for his “terrific” sense of humor.
“He probably could make the Queen of England on her throne laugh,” he said.
Levi Goldfarb said his father always had “open arms and open doors” for everyone and was willing to help anyone who needed it.
“He felt that his reason for being was to make the world a better place and to help the people around him in any way that he could,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Medical experts, cancer survivors, and philanthropists discussed the prevalence of cancer and the systemic inequities in the healthcare system during an event at the Harvard School of Public Health on Thursday to mark World Cancer Day, an international day to raise awareness about cancer.
Moderated by Pamela D. Oliver, a correspondent for Fox Sports, the panel included Chaunté Lowe, a cancer survivor and four-time Olympian; Dikembe Mutombo, an eight-time NBA all-star and humanitarian; and Ronald E. Rivera, a cancer patient and the coach of the Washington Football Team.
The event also featured three medical experts: Katrina A. Armstrong, a professor at Harvard Medical School; Meg O’Brien, vice president for Global Cancer Treatment at the American Cancer Society; and Timothy R. Rebbeck, a professor at the School of Public Health who studies cancer prevention.
Following an introduction by University President Lawrence S. Bacow and School of Public Health Dean Michelle A. Williams, the panelists discussed their personal experiences with cancer, the importance of early screening for cancer prevention, and reasons for hope moving forward in the fight against cancer.
Lowe, a survivor of breast cancer, shared her story as a woman of color trying to obtain proper medical care in a health care system riddled with systemic inequities.
“It was very difficult to even get in for an appointment for a mammogram and an ultrasound,” Lowe said. “The doctor decided to tell me that [the lump] was just a normal lymph node and not to come back for six years.”
Unconvinced by her physician’s diagnosis, Lowe proceeded to get a second opinion and was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 36.
“The lesson really, from Chaunté’s story, is to trust your gut,” Oliver said. “If you feel that something is not right, stop at nothing to get to the bottom of it. Early detection, as we’ve heard already, can make the difference between a successful outcome and a catastrophic one.”
Armstrong — who also serves as physician-in-chief of Massachusetts General Hospital — echoed Oliver’s remarks and advocated for early screening for cancer.
“We should take every lump seriously,” she said. “Everything should be done to make sure that that lump is not cancer, and everybody should be focusing on that.”
Armstrong recommended all women to begin cancer screening before the age of 50, especially if they have risk factors or family history.
She also discussed the prevalence of racism and discrimination in the health care system and how it has reduced trust in physician care.
“We, I, all of us in healthcare, have to make that system trustworthy. And to do that, we’ve got to root out issues of racism and discrimination,” Armstrong said. “We also need to change who’s in the system, hiring people of color, building a clinical workforce of color that matches the patients who we serve, because we know that improves communication.”
O’Brien, who has led a portfolio of projects expanding access to cancer treatment throughout Africa, noted the importance of collaborating with local organizations to educate people about the signs and symptoms of cancer. She also highlighted the need to address the fear of cancer and its diagnosis, as well as educating health care providers to ensure proper medical treatment and care.
Rebbeck discussed the role of universal healthcare, education, and awareness on cancer treatment and prevention in the United States.
“We need to work to get universal coverage for all people, but it’s also important for us to think about the timeline before there is universal coverage,” Rebbeck said.
“The system isn’t the only thing that determines what our fate is. The system disadvantages some people, no question. We have to deal with that,” he added. “But we have a lot of resources that are available to help us get around what the system has done to some people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: February 5, 2021 at 6:45 p.m.
The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences officially welcomed concentrators from the class of 2023 at its first virtual sophomore convocation Thursday night.
Nearly 100 sophomores – in fields ranging from Computer Science to Applied Math to Mechanical Engineering – joined SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III for the 75-minute event, which featured keynote speaker R. Martin “Marty” Chavez ’85, a panel of five alumni, and a virtual tour of the newly constructed Science and Engineering Complex in Allston.
Chavez, a former chief financial officer at Goldman Sachs, emphasized how a liberal arts education combined with computer science enabled him to move up the ranks of Wall Street.
“I was not by any means the best coder or the best software architect or the best mathematician, I wasn't the best in the group by a longshot at anything,” he said. “Here's the thing that Harvard did for me. Almost uniquely as it turned out, among the quants of Goldman Sachs and engineers, I could write a cogent English paragraph.”
Panelist Linsey C. Marr ’96, an engineering professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, added that the Engineering Sciences concentration at Harvard enabled her to explore different areas of the field.
“At MIT and other places, you have to choose a specific engineering major,” she said. “Engineering Sciences was a great pick for me because I ended up taking courses in all different types of engineering.”
When asked about favorite classes at Harvard, panelist Kayla M. Shelton ’13 — current construction manager at DTE Energy — answered that hers was SEAS’s General Education 1104: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter Science.”
“Everybody knows about the infamous science of cooking class,” she said.
That class jumpstarted her lab work and resulted in her volunteering to teach inner city students in Boston about science and cooking.
Other panelists included Alisa Luu ’15, a senior engineering lead at Nava, and Benjamin T. Zauzmer ’15, who oversees baseball analytics for the New York Mets. Morgan T. Pope ’09, a research scientist for Disney Studios, rounded out the roster of returning graduates.
Zauzmer, who concentrated in Applied Mathematics, said in an interview with The Crimson his interest in predictive analytics was piqued by a combined computer science and statistics course at SEAS, which taught him how to predict the results of everything, from awards shows to elections.
Zauzmer added that SEAS was unique insofar as its engineering students are afforded a “well-rounded” liberal arts education.
“Hopefully they'll be able to take those skills that they learn in SEAS and revolutionize — whether it's other industries or other facets of life — and try to make their little corner of the world a better place,” he said.
Though still smaller than the Sciences Division of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, SEAS has witnessed steady growth in recent years, rising from 174 declared sophomore concentrators in the Class of 2013 to 293 in the last decade.
Jaxson T. Hill ’23, a sophomore in attendance, said the virtual ceremony was “pretty cool.”
Matej Cerman ’23, another sophomore at the convocation, said the event made SEAS “a little more tangible” for students learning virtually due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Both Hill and Cerman said the highlight of the convocation was Doyle’s virtual tour of the soon-to-be-opened Science and Engineering Complex in Allston.
The SEC — the current iteration of which was approved by the Boston Redevelopment Authority in 2016 — is finally set to become the new home for the school after years of planning and delays.
Hill described the SEC tour as the “star of the show” and “Cabot Library on steroids,” referring to the popular student study spot in the Science Center.
“So worth the wait — the building looks incredible,” he said. “After every hallway, there’s something new and enormous and amazing. The dining hall where you can swipe to get lunches? We’re never going to leave!”
CORRECTION: February 5, 2021
A previous version of this article incorrectly attributed the quote, “At MIT and other places, you have to choose a specific engineering major. Engineering Sciences was a great pick for me because I ended up taking courses in all different types of engineering,” to Alisa Luu ’15. In fact, Linsey C. Marr '96 said this quote during the panel.

On August 2, 1983, Henry Rosovsky, the then-dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, placed a letter in the personnel file of Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez following an investigation that found Domínguez had sexually harassed assistant Government professor Terry L. Karl.
The letter stated that if Domínguez repeated the offense, the FAS should recommend to the Harvard Corporation that Domínguez be fired.
Six years later, after an undergraduate student alleged additional misconduct by Domínguez, the termination recommendation was never made.
Instead, Domínguez was well on his way to rising through the University’s ranks, padding his resume to eventually serve in a slew of prominent leadership positions, including as the vice provost for international affairs.
By 2018, Domínguez had gone on to sexually harass at least 18 women at Harvard — a pattern of behavior that was known among his peers in the Government department, according to an external review into sexual harassment at Harvard published Thursday.
The allegations against Domínguez first surfaced publicly in reports published by the Chronicle of Higher Education in 2018. Days after the accusations were reported, Domínguez announced he would retire. In 2019, after an investigation, FAS Dean Claudine Gay stripped him of his emeritus status and barred him from the FAS campus.
In a 26-page report released by the University Thursday, an external committee reviewing sexual harassment at Harvard detailed a “permissive culture regarding sexual harassment” at the school that enabled Domínguez to continue rising through leadership as he sexually harassed female students and colleagues with all but no penalty.
The review, conducted by a committee led by former MIT President Susan Hockfield, included an analysis of confidential files and the Chronicle articles, in addition to interviews with Government department faculty and students, University administrators, faculty and staff members whose work relates to Title IX, and four women harassed by Domínguez.
Here are six key takeaways from the committee’s report.
In the years following Rosovsky’s 1983 letter, numerous women made similar complaints alleging inappropriate behavior by Domínguez.
Their disclosures of misconduct, however, never triggered the consequences that Rosovsky had laid out.
In 1989, an undergraduate student “disclosed issues concerning Domínguez” to an assistant dean, who communicated the allegations to the Dean of the College and University counsel. By that time, Domínguez held numerous leadership positions, including serving as director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
Following the student’s disclosure, no action was taken by the University, despite Rosovsky’s 1983 recommendation that FAS move to terminate Domínguez if further revelations of misconduct came about.
“This inaction is troubling,” the report says, “as the activity described in the 1989 letter, if true, could have triggered a dismissal recommendation to the Corporation under the terms of the Rosovsky sanctions.”
University officials failed on other occasions to record harassment complaints they received in any official file.
Years later, top University officials were aware of the original 1983 allegations against Domínguez — but not the subsequent 1989 disclosure — when they selected him for higher leadership roles, the report states.
Under FAS Dean William C. Kirby, University President Lawrence H. Summers, and University Provost Steven E. Hyman, Domínguez became chair of the Harvard Academy in 2004 and then the inaugural vice provost for international affairs in 2006.
Administrators considering Domínguez for higher-up positions discussed the 1983 allegations with the leadership of the FAS, the University, and the Government department, but decided that he “had reformed his ways, and that he should not be further punished for past misbehavior,” per the report.
Those administrators told the committee they would not have considered Domínguez for the positions had they known about his continued harassment.
“These individuals expressed profound distress and regret that they had not uncovered evidence of Domínguez’s ongoing harassment,” the report said.
Though top officials were aware of the 1983 complaints when they selected Domínguez for high-profile roles, the report concluded that administrators could have been uninformed while vetting him for leadership positions because Harvard lacks a centralized repository for personnel files.
Several complaints were recorded in two different locations, making it difficult “for even a well-intentioned reviewer to locate records of past misconduct with confidence,” the report said.
Reports from 2015 accusing Domínguez of misconduct were housed exclusively in files held by the Title IX office, while records from the disclosures in 1983 and 1989 lived only in his faculty personnel file.
“The lack of a centralized repository could have impeded the University’s efforts to vet him for the positions he held,” the report reads.
The decentralization, however, does not leave University officials without blame given that “some individuals made disclosures to University officials that were not recorded in either official personnel file,” the report states.
The report recommends the creation of a “centralized, comprehensive, searchable personnel record,” which Harvard currently lacks. Such a database, the report continues, “would have considerable utility in vetting candidates for leadership roles. It would also allow the University to monitor individuals with past sanctions more effectively.”
Had Harvard more clearly communicated its processes for reporting sexual harassment and publicized the 1983 sanctions against Domínguez, his subsequent misconduct “might have been reported and addressed sooner,” the report states.
The committee found that since the initial sanctions against Domínguez in 1983, Harvard has developed “thoughtful anonymous procedures” for handling sexual harassment disclosures.
But a lack of clarity about the protections granted to individuals impacted by alleged incidents under the policies has left harassment victims with concerns of “losing control of the process,” dissuading disclosures.
“We repeatedly encountered individuals who feared that they would be named and thereby opened to retaliation,” the report reads.
The committee also spoke to several individuals who stated they were aware of Domínguez’s harassment, but did not report it because they were concerned the University would impose “unduly severe” sanctions.
Harvard currently has two pathways for responding to sexual harassment complaints. Affiliates may either file a disclosure — which allows for anonymity — with the Title IX Office or file a formal complaint — which requires identification — with the Office for Dispute Resolution. Formal complaints may trigger full investigations, whereas disclosures are intended only to “convey information” about an alleged perpetrator.
Harvard’s policies also grant the University discretion to scale its responses to fit the severity of the alleged misconduct and the accused individual’s history.
The committee recommended the University undertake a “widespread educational effort” to inform affiliates how the process for reporting harassment works in order to assuage concerns.
But in the case of Domínguez, the University’s communication troubles extended beyond a lack of procedural clarity.
Adhering to its policy at the time, Harvard kept the 1983 investigation and sanctions against Domínguez confidential. Publicizing these sanctions might have motivated those who witnessed or experienced misconduct to report it and would have ensured the terms of the sanctions were enforced, the external committee posited.
Just two years after Rosovsky barred Domínguez from bearing any administrative responsibilities in the Government department for three years, the department appointed Domínguez as the chair of its Special Appointments Committee, in violation of the sanctions.
“The failure to publicize sanctions led to confusion and consternation across generations about whether Domínguez had been punished at all,” the report reads. “Publicizing the sanctions to the community might have increased the probability of their enforcement.”
The report also argues that increasing transparency around investigations and their results will encourage individuals to report harassment.
“Such transparency enhances the psychological safety of future impacted parties by demonstrating that their reports will be taken seriously, will not entail risk to them, and will result in concrete action,” it reads.
While Domínguez ascended through various administrative and leadership positions, whispers of his misconduct circulated throughout the Government department.
Individuals interviewed by the committee reported “severe” power disparities between senior faculty and other members of the department, including junior faculty, staff, and students.
“In this culture, junior members feared their careers could be derailed or destroyed if they triggered the displeasure of a senior member,” the report reads. “Even in the absence of direct retaliation, students worried about being branded as ‘troublemakers’ by powerful members of the community.”
The imbalance of power kept individuals from coming forward with complaints of misconduct, per the report.
“One individual stated that she was reluctant to bring her harassment complaint about Domínguez to her faculty mentor because that mentor was untenured,” the report reads. “She believed that asking him to take her side (as she believed he would) could jeopardize his career.”
This pattern of inaction extended throughout the department.
Following the 1983 accusations against Domínguez and two other accusations against Government professors within a span of six years, the department did not conduct an internal review to prevent future incidents of sexual harassment.
Rather, senior members of the department reportedly knew of Domínguez’s harassment and made no apparent effort to stop the misconduct.
“A whisper network clearly held knowledge of Domínguez’s misconduct, which suggests that at least some senior faculty had some level of awareness about his behavior,” the report reads. “Nonetheless, no one stepped forward to arrest it.”
One student highlighted in the report said she complained about Domínguez to a FAS harassment counselor, who she said implied he knew of ongoing misconduct.
“The counselor told her that if the student identified the Department, the counselor could guess the faculty member,” the report states.
The committee recommended the University conduct internal reviews of its departments every three years to create accountability within department leadership and to closely examine sexual and gender-based harassment issues.
Following the 1983 sanctions, the University and the FAS did not monitor or reevaluate Domínguez’s behavior. No such monitoring policies currently exist.
The committee wrote the University does not have a duty to remove all harassers from the school, but suggested Harvard create “scaled processes” to oversee the conduct of employees previously accused of sexual harassment.
“The University has the responsibility to monitor individuals who have been found to have committed misconduct so that any subsequent infraction can be detected and addressed,” the report states.
Under the committee’s proposed monitoring system, the University would notify individuals found guilty of misconduct that their behavior will be watched and that any disclosures against them “will be escalated to top levels of authority.”
University offices that receive complaints would also be able to check the names of individuals facing accusations against a database of offenders. The presence of previous offenses would trigger a formal investigation.
In some of its most damning conclusions, the report contends that “a culture permissive of sexual and gender-based harassment can be recognized in each part” of its analysis.
The report put blame on cavernous faculty gender imbalances within the Government department for the underreporting of sexual harassment. Just 9 percent of Government faculty were women in 1980, though female representation in the department has since improved to 31.3 percent as of 2019.
The report also found many individuals opted not to report harassment because they “were concerned that the University was being deliberately inattentive to it.”
Top administrators’ failures to adequately consult Domínguez’s personnel files before his appointment to high-level positions could also be “viewed as a symptom” of the permissive culture, the report states.
“Precisely because we acknowledge the scale of the problem, we urge Harvard to mobilize its vast intelligence and ingenuity to solving the problem of sexual harassment not only for itself, but as an example for all institutions of higher education,” the report concludes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1983, then-assistant Government professor Terry L. Karl accused fellow Government professor Jorge I. Domínguez of sexually harassing her.
On Thursday — nearly four decades later — University President Lawrence S. Bacow apologized to Karl in a letter accompanying the final report by an external committee tasked with determining what had allowed Domínguez to climb Harvard’s ranks despite multiple allegations of harassment over several decades.
“Harvard failed her,” Bacow wrote.
“I also apologize to those whose subsequent sexual harassment might have been avoided if Harvard had taken timely and appropriate actions,” he added.
Following the report’s publication and Bacow’s letter Thursday, Karl and another woman whom Domínguez harassed, Charna E. Sherman ’80, told The Crimson they were pleased Bacow apologized, but felt deeper systematic changes are still needed at Harvard to protect women from harassment in the future.
“As much as this apology and President Bacow’s words mean to me personally, and as st[r]ongly as I believe that they are due to so many other women, I fear that the changes that need to be made to redress systemic harassment and discrimination at Harvard and other universities still lie in the future,” Karl wrote in an emailed statement.
“Our advocacy to make changes not only at Harvard but also in Title IX and the US Dept of Education has only just begun,” she added.
Despite Harvard’s acknowledgment of its failings in her case, Karl wrote that “this is not what usually happens.”
“Make no mistake: I am the exception,” Karl wrote. “The overwhelming number of women usually lose their jobs, their confidence, and sometimes their self-respect.”
She added that recent revelations of faculty sexual harassment in multiple other Harvard departments have convinced her that “sexual misconduct at Harvard is pervasive and egregious.”
“Complacency towards harassment and abuse is so widespread that I cannot in good conscience advise other women to participate in any of Harvard’s current Title IX processes concerning misconduct by tenured faculty,” wrote Karl, who received an advance copy of the report from Bacow Thursday morning, along with a note thanking her for her persistence in demanding justice.
Sherman, a former Government concentrator who said she experienced harassment while working with Domínguez in the late 1970s, said the harassment experienced by Karl and many other women “might never had happened” had the University taken Sherman’s initial complaint in 1979 “more seriously.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on Karl’s and Sherman’s responses to the report.
Two Government Ph.D. students — part of a group that spent years advocating for the external review — also said Thursday they supported the report’s recommendations, though they remained skeptical that the proposals would be implemented.
Sophie E. Hill said she was relieved that the report was published into the public record, as she and other members of the Government Department Graduate Student Association’s External Review Working Group began advocating for an external review in March 2018.
“We had this feeling that there had been collective amnesia about Domínguez,” Hill said. “There were so many faculty that told us they had no idea about any of the allegations.”
Nevertheless, Hill said she wished the report credited Karl and other survivors for their advocacy towards an external review of sexual harassment culture.
“The first people to ask for an external review was not the Government department; it was Terry Karl,” she said. “Some of the other women who came forward, they asked for it a long time before, and we as grad students tried to pick that up and amplify that.”
Reva Dhingra, another member of the working group, said although it is important that the report acknowledges the “toxic hierarchies of power” which allowed sexual harassment allegations against Domínguez to go unheard, she still believes “people don’t feel comfortable” reporting harassment to Title IX.
“This is where I didn’t agree with the report: it spent a huge chunk discussing how much reporting mechanisms have improved at Harvard,” Dhingra said. “But you have people at this university who are consistently seeing that these processes are not sufficient.”
The external review — commissioned in 2019 by Bacow to investigate the circumstances that allowed repeated acts of sexual harassment by Dominguez over four decades — found that “pronounced power disparities” and “inadequate reporting mechanisms” may have inhibited a more effective response.
Government professor Steven R. Levitsky, who chaired a departmental climate review following the allegations that ultimately recommended the University launch a further, independent probe, wrote in an emailed statement that he is glad the report was undertaken by an external panel and made public.
“I learned much from it—far more than I would have had the review been done internally,” he wrote. “This is a critical step toward holding us—Harvard and the Government Department—to account for our decades-long failure.”
Government chair Jeffry A. Frieden wrote in a statement that he plans to spend the coming weeks working with colleagues “to explore how we can best learn from the report.”
“I believe that our most important task in this regard is to establish an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect among all members of our community,” he wrote. “I recognize that we have a distance to travel before we achieve that goal. I do hope that the External Review Committee report will help us move in the right direction.”

Are you stressed, overwhelmed, and lost in a sea of section sign-ups and scheduling conflicts? Fear not: your comfort character is here to help. Now, you might be asking, “What is a comfort character?” Great question, Deb. Let’s get into it! (I hope someone else agrees that “Deb” sounds like someone who would ask a lot of questions, perhaps at a PTA — or Parent Teacher Association — conference, perhaps with a hairstyle that looks suspiciously like that of Big Bird. But, I digress.).
Comfort characters! Comfort characters are those characters in your favorite TV show or movie that just, for some inexplicable reason, are so relaxing to watch. It might be a character that reminds you of someone in real life, or it can be someone you feel like you relate to and want to be friends with, or even a character that reminds you of yourself. There are a lot of different reasons why you might have a comfort character, but the bottom line is they are a fictional person that gives you such a strong sense of familiarity that you turn to them when your friend Deb just isn’t cutting it (c’mon Deb!).
For example, my very own personal comfort character is Pam from The Office. Any time I’m feeling super overwhelmed with school work and face the weekly existential crisis of thinking about what I want to do with my life, I turn to trusty ol’ Pam to show me that everything happens for a reason and it’s all gonna work out in the end. You just need to get past your Roy to find your Jim, everyone! In some cases, your Roy might be your lengthy GenEd reading that feels impossible to start, or it may be the person in your breakout room who seems to know all the answers and get annoyed when they have to explain anything to you. Maybe it’s even the long-term significant other who is holding you back — if you would like to go with the straightforward example. Point being, watching Pam stick it out and become a true self-confident, assertive queen who has what she wants is just . . . the best.
So! Let me inspire you — you just must procrastinate more so that you can get out there and find your true comfort character...maybe even use this as an opportunity to spend your Wellness Day well. Perhaps I can provide a few suggestions of such characters, if nothing comes to mind. I think some of the best comfort characters are the ones in long running TV shows that you can watch grow and change as the show progresses. If you’re feeling down in the dumps about ~politics~, maybe you could turn to Leslie and Ben from Parks and Rec for a little bit of positive political spunk. If that breakout room nemesis is making you feel like you don’t really rule the (virtual) school, I’m sure that Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen from Gossip Girl can assure you otherwise. Of course, a show doesn’t have to have a million seasons to qualify! I mean, if you’re feeling like “Wow, I am always in sweats and always in my dorm and I never look even somewhat presentable,” then Daphne Bridgerton and Simon Hastings will allow you to live vicariously through their highly stylish early 19th century lives.
If you still feel like you have no idea where to look for your comfort character, please allow me to entertain myself by throwing out a **conspiracy theory**. Maybe we occasionally find comfort in characters that look and/or act like us? I’ve been told a few times that I look like Pam from The Office, and I even had someone tell me that “You’re exactly like Pam. Like, why do you look and act like her,” which I will pretend did not come across as having a slightly insulting intention. Anyway, maybe some of the best comfort characters can be the ones that kind of remind us of ourselves! So if you’ve ever had someone tell you that you look like a famous actor or actress, maybe go check them out and see what they’re up to, because one of their roles might just be your comfort character. What I am really trying to say is that I think everyone has, or should have some sort of a comfort character to turn to when you’re stressed, because watching their unrealistic, fictional lives will make you feel a little bit better about your all too real, sadly unfictional assignments that seem to just keep coming.
