After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tomorrow morning, most Harvard students will undoubtedly be sleeping in, basking in end-of-classes bliss before the rigors of finals week begin.
The women of the Crimson squash program, on the other hand, will be braving the cold and snow in Ithaca, N.Y., as they hit the Belkin International Squash Courts to face No. 7 Cornell (1-2, 0-2 Ivy).
Harvard (4-0, 2-0) enters the weekend with a No. 1 CSA ranking and a roster boasting talent one-to-nine: not a single player has dropped a match yet. The squad also carries into the match a 9-0 victory over last year’s Big Red team.
Sophomore Laura Gemmell will likely continue her play in the top slot, having yet to drop a single match in the position since the start of her collegiate career last fall. The 2010 CSA individual champ boasts a 20-0 record.
Cornell’s likely No. 1, sophomore Jaime Laird, has her work cut out for her. She enters the match with a 1-2 record after beating her Franklin & Marshall opponent but falling to Ivy foes Penn and Princeton. She also lost to Gemmell in last year’s top match-up, 11-2, 11-8, 11-7.
Other Crimson players to watch this weekend will be sophomore Natasha Kingshott, a fixture in the No. 5 spot, No. 3 captain Alisha Mashruwala, and junior Nirasha Guruge, who has opened this season with dominant performances in the No. 2 position. Sophomore Sarah Mumanachit has also played well at No. 4. Collectively, the ladies have dropped only five games in four matches.
Slots six through nine have been shuffled around a bit so far this season, but the shifting has done little to slow Harvard down. Senior June Tiong, junior Cece Cortes, sophomore Vidya Rajan, sophomore Eliza Calihan, freshman Natasha Anzik, and senior Bethan Williams have all seen action in the latter end of the varsity rotation thus far, and none has dropped a match yet.
The Crimson hopes to carry this momentum into its first road contest of the season and use it to topple the Big Red, which is no doubt hurting after a 7-2 loss against the Tigers and a 9-0 blanking at the hands of the Quakers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With Reading Period starting, the semester is winding down for most students, but for a few teams, the seasons are just starting to heat up.
The men’s basketball team is on a roll this season. After losing its opening matchup to George Mason, the squad is on a five-game winning streak. On Wednesday, Harvard dominated Fordham, 80-57, at home. The Crimson faces off against Michigan in another road game today at 1 p.m. Harvard and Michigan have met three times before, with the Wolverines holding the slight edge, 2-1, in the series. In the last meeting, Harvard earned its first victory over Michigan, 62-51 at Lavietes in the 2007-08 season.
The men’s swimming and diving squad also hits the road this weekend, but much closer to home. Undefeated in its first four meets, the men head to Connecticut today at 2 p.m. for another non-conference meet. Harvard has a perfect record against Connecticut, with three wins, but the teams have not men since 1971.
The men’s and women’s squash teams travel for away matches the first time this season. Both the men and women are undefeated this year. The men have three wins over their competitors, the closest being a 7-2 victory, but the women have been completely relentless. The squad has swept its four matches by a 9-0 count. The men take on Cornell today at 1 p.m. and Rochester tomorrow at 5 p.m. The women compete against Cornell today at 11 a.m.
The women’s ice hockey team travels to No. 6 Boston College tomorrow at 2 p.m., looking to snap a two-game losing streak. The women lost to the Minnesota twice in a doubleheader, 3-0 and 4-2, last weekend but won two games against Dartmouth before that. Harvard holds a dominant 36-9 record over the Eagles, which includes a 5-0 victory over Boston College last season.
Finally, to wrap up the weekend, the women’s fencing team travels to Fairfield, Connecticut for the Sacred Heart Invitational tomorrow. The women won, 20-7, against Tufts on Wednesday. Also, the wrestling squad heads to the Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational, which started yesterday but continues through today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A box score from Dec. 17, 1978, shows that Boston College beat the Harvard men’s basketball team, 86-83, at the Boston Garden. But the game meant much more than the score for one player.
Glenn Fine ’79 started the day in Baltimore, where he met with the Rhodes Scholarship committee. In the afternoon, he boarded a private plane donated by a Harvard alumnus to fly back to Boston. Upon landing, he received a police escort to the Boston Garden and then played the full 40 minutes as the Crimson took on undefeated Boston College.
Nine of Harvard’s 12 players did not have any varsity experience before the season, but they still managed to take the Eagles down to the wire, thanks in large part to Fine’s play. The co-captain tallied 10 points, seven assists, and four steals in the opening half, and the Crimson went into intermission trailing just 48-45.
Harvard hung with Boston College throughout the second frame, cutting the lead to one with five seconds to play, but a pair of free throws sealed an 86-83 win for the Eagles (the game was later found to be a part of the Boston College point-shaving scandal implemented by Henry Hill of Goodfellas fame).
At the end of a long day, Fine finished with 19 points, 14 assists, eight steals, and, most importantly, one Rhodes Scholarship. In the locker room after the game, the Pennsylvania native received a call on a pay phone from the committee telling him that he had been awarded the prize—much like senior wideout Zar Zavala learned via text after The Game two weeks ago.
“I’m kind of shell-shocked,” he told the Boston Globe at the time. “It’s the opportunity of a lifetime. I’m kind of numb.”
After studying at Oxford, Fine went on to pursue a career in law, eventually rising to the position of Inspector General at the Department of Justice. Serving three presidents over the last 10 years, Fine announced Monday that he will step down from the position on Jan. 28, 2011 to pursue other professional opportunities.
One of the longest-serving inspector generals in history, Fine’s influence on American politics in many ways began on that December night in 1978. The box score says Boston College 86, Harvard 83, but it does not reflect that Fine was the true winner.

As the Cambridge weather nears freezing and our workloads call for all-nighters, one thing remains constant in the life of nearly every Harvard student's diet: the burrito.  In this mini-series, we’ll be posting detailed reviews and rankings of grilled chicken burritos from four different establishments (Boloco, Chipotle, Qdoba, and Felipe's) while judging on criteria ranging from temperature to tortilla thickness. By the end, we hope to have made the lives of inebriated wanderers and starving studiers a little easier, while offering an easy tool for Reading Period procrastination—burrito rankings.
 
Burrito #2 Qdoba’s grilled chicken burrito:
Includes: Chicken, salsa, black beans, cilantro-lime rice, and cheese—in a tortilla, of course.
 
Price: $6.29
 
-300 points for the priciest burrito.
 
Weight: 1 lb, 6 oz.
 
+1,000 points for the heaviest burrito! Seriously, this resembled a small child.
 
Tortilla: Super chewy and thick, almost doughy.
 
-100 points for the tortilla’s excessive stretchiness, but +200 points for a flavor-absorbent quality.
 
Rice: Very dry. Very boring. Very large amount.
 
-100 points for taste, +100 points for the pleasing purple color it became adjacent to the black beans.
 
Guacamole: $1.49
 
-50 points for making us pay, +50 points for not being the most expensive.
 
Chicken: No spice or flavor to be found.
 
-300 points for boring poultry.
 
Cheese: Seemingly nonexistent.
 
-200 points. Cheese is important!
 
Extras: Corn salsa (tasty), salsa verde (mild), chipotle sauce (medium), hot sauce (hot), and sour cream.
 
+300 points for catering to diverse palates.
 
Hours of operation: 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. Sunday through Wednesday, 11 p.m. to 12 a.m. Thursday through Saturday.
 
+300 points for being open late, -100 for not being open late enough.
 
Deals and steals: Annual Rice and Bean Pot Eating Contest—of which Harvard students are reigning champions—and Dice Day Wednesdays
 
+800 points for giving speedy burrito eaters a chance to win a trip to Mexico in the eating contest, -100 for not renewing the by-one-get-one-free coupons that were on the back of tickets from the Harvard Box Office.
 
The bottom line: There was nothing particularly special about Qdoba’s burrito: the rice was bland, the chicken was bland, and the cheese hardly existed. While the meal was four cents more expensive than Boloco’s burrito, it included a better variety of sauces and three more ounces. It definitely wasn’t difficult to stop eating—always a bad sign—but the burrito wasn’t quite as disappointing Boloco.
Total points: 1,400 
Final Ranking: 3/4
