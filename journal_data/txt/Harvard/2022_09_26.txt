After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Bostonians hate many things, as I’ve learned since moving here. But no group of people draws the complete and unfettered wrath of Massachusetts drivers like cyclists.
Drivers wonder why cyclists are so worried about their safety. After all, they assert, there are plenty of bike lanes nowadays, painted green and plainly visible to cars. If a cyclist avoids those lanes and decides to cut into a hazardous intersection, well, that’s on them.
But this reasoning belies the reality of car-bicycle relationships and how they tend to share the road.
The cyclists I see around Harvard Square are hyper-vigilant and alert. They risk their safety riding here, with little infrastructure to protect them. Despite having separate bike lanes in some places, our campus streets are far from protecting cyclists effectively. They travel about 10 to 15 miles per hour as the cars to their left and right zoom at twice that speed. Instead of grade separation, where the bike lanes are at sidewalk level, there are flimsy barriers and painted markings.
The lack of these essential features can kill. And unfortunately, it has.
In 2020, a truck killed a cyclist outside Harvard Station. Just this summer, two more cyclists in our area were struck and killed. From Porter Square to Inman Square, a depressing and predictable pattern emerges: our poor bicycle infrastructure increases the volume of reported crashes, doorings, and deaths. The worst part is that it all happens within a few square miles.
I would know about how dangerous painted bike lanes can be because I’ve ridden on them. One night, my friends and I decided to bike from Harvard Square to the new SEAS building in Allston. That required us to traverse the previously mentioned bike lanes on JFK Street. It is hard to recognize how much faster and larger cars can be until you are fully exposed three feet away from one. On campus, I have witnessed drivers hit pedestrians at crosswalks and cyclists swerve to avoid cars that cut into the unprotected bike lane.
Boston and Cambridge have the highest cycling fatalities in Massachusetts. These deaths are not freak accidents — they are policy failures.
We know how to prevent cycling injuries, and the solutions are easy and cheap. But when advocates promote these solutions at city council meetings or community events, they don’t quite know what response to expect from residents. Cycling remains polarizing here, despite our area being one of the most bike-friendly places in the United States.
Several organizations are working to change that sentiment. In Cambridge, we have Cambridge Bike Safety, an organization dedicated to improving the local cycling infrastructure. CBS’s work and advocacy led to the city passing the country’s first Cycling Safety Ordinance in 2019. The ordinance guarantees protected bike lanes on many streets over the next five years, from Massachusetts Avenue to Cambridge Street.
The organization was founded in response to the death of Amanda Phillips back in 2016. Phillips, a student at The MGH Institute of Health Professions, was cycling in Inman Square when a Jeep driver opened his door and struck her. She fell into the path of a landscaping truck. Her death, and that of another cyclist four months later, accelerated discussions around cycling infrastructure. Thanks to those discussions and CBS’s advocacy efforts, the city of Cambridge installed protected bike lanes between Inman Square and Harvard Square, including the area where Amanda Phillips died.
Six years on, these improvements are instrumental in reducing cycling injuries.
Opening a door into a bike lane is a small mistake that creates a dangerous situation for cyclists. Behaviors like these are ingrained in our driving culture. Cars pull into a bike lane to pick up food; trucks do it to drop supplies off. These aren’t always conscious actions, but they have severe consequences.
Those severe consequences extend beyond physical ones. They tend to dampen the public’s view on cycling safety, making it more difficult and stressful for people to get on the road and bike. So organizations and supportive residents enter the picture, promoting cycling infrastructure that protects public safety.
In Cambridge, a bike lane project under the Cycling Safety Ordinance typically starts with City staff. They reach out to neighbors and residents and announce that there is a project coming. The outreach has improved over time, and more residents are paying attention to street changes. I attended a few project meetings where staff listened to feedback and conducted surveys. During the process, they will iterate on the designs, present them to residents, and take additional feedback.
And it seems like residents are optimistic. While online discussion around cycling deteriorates into stereotypes and finger-pointing, real-world surveys show that people are excited to see the streets become safer.
Unfortunately, though, the opposition is a loud minority. It is understandable; people fear what a change in the status quo would mean and often resort to knee-jerk responses.
For example, many opponents of cycling infrastructure say it would only be suitable during the warmer months, not while it is snowy and cold. But many people cycle year-round, especially if they can access usable bike facilities. Protected bike networks encourage dedicated maintenance; bike lanes should be considered essential infrastructure, not an area to dump snow. These simple adjustments, practiced in other snowy regions like Scandinavia and Canada, can markedly improve cycling safety.
Bike lanes are also relatively inexpensive to build. Cambridge’s Complete Streets program spends $13.5 million a year. Those funds produce huge investments that require less maintenance than roads do. Plus, the long-term physical and social benefits of cycling drive down a range of expenses.
Finally, accessibility is a primary concern. Cities should ensure and meet the access needs of disabled people. Thankfully, the evidence shows that cycling infrastructure improves accessibility. With adaptive bicycles, many disabled people ride in Boston. Many more would, too — if given safer lanes.
Altogether, the past half-decade of progress has launched the Boston area into one of the most bike-friendly cities in the United States. We have achieved plenty of changes. The Slow Streets and Open Streets programs in Boston and the Bluebikes outside Smith Center show that when cities build good cycling infrastructure, people use it.
Safe, accessible bike lanes are beginning to criss-cross our region. Thankfully, Cambridge and Boston seem committed to expanding our cycling culture.
However, that commitment only came when advocacy groups, officials, and residents came together and decided to prioritize people over cars and challenge the status quo. As students, we can and should continue doing this. After all, these will be our streets for four years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Apologies Cambridge loyalists: Allston is here to stay.
A year after Harvard opened its landmark Science and Engineering Complex in Allston, growing shares of the student body are frequently visiting the neighborhood for classes, shifting our institutional center of gravity towards the Charles’ shores. Harvard’s ambitious spurt, years in the making, is finally coming to life — and with it comes increased scrutiny on the hidden costs behind our newest lecture halls.
Our board has opined on the Allston initiatives repeatedly in the past, tracing Harvard’s progressive expansion year after year; we have come to accept the path of ‘progress’ — of glimmering architectural complexes and Veritas prints — as almost inescapable. Assessing the overall toll of our University’s presence remains, on the other hand, an ongoing and daunting task.
Harvard’s presence in Allston, while relatively disruptive, is not necessarily a bad thing — nor does it have to be, assuming responsible stewardship and investments to minimize our institution’s growing pains. The new campus isn’t just a boon for the swarms of students who now get to take classes in slightly newer, far away buildings: If one believes in the productive impacts of academia writ large, the busy lecture halls and labs across the river are bound to facilitate the sort of knowledge creation that can prove immensely socially beneficial. The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex, for example, might spur the expansion of research programs wrestling with some of the biggest questions in medicine, climate science, or other deeply impactful fields.
The upsides to the expansion aren’t exclusively hypothetical. Harvard’s growth will bring — has brought, in some cases — undeniable, tangible benefits to the Allston community. The proposed Enterprise Research Complex, for example, has been dubbed a project “for everyone” by University President Lawrence S. Bacow, and claims to offer opportunities to Allston’s own residents. Outside Harvard’s vast confines, the sheer influx of affiliates into Allston will almost certainly increase foot traffic in the area, expanding the customer base of Allston businesses and hopefully boosting the neighborhood’s sometimes meager economy.
Promising initiatives and glimmering buildings do not, however, fully capture the development’s local footprint — nor do they convey its potentially taxing impact on some residents. Allstonians have good reason to be skeptical of Harvard’s good faith. The University’s secretive land-buying strategy — which saw it purchase acres across the river under a generic developer’s name for eight years, in what has been deemed exemplary of “the highest level of arrogance”  — sowed rightful distrust between the University and town leaders. The ensuing rift will not heal overnight, and Harvard’s lackluster, contemporaneous response, which dismissed years’ worth of mischaracterizations as “fiscally prudent,” hardly helped. The University must, if nothing else, acknowledge that it understands how its past behavior feeds current reticence. Moving forward, transparency (and not financial prudency) must be the norm: Future and ongoing plans shouldn’t be kept secret for the benefit of Harvard’s finances to the detriment of locals. Residents of the communities our development plans might affect are entitled to helpful, timely updates regarding our institutional expansion.
Those future plans should also include tangible benefits for the most vulnerable in Allston — the families and individuals who will likely face rising rents as their secluded corner of Boston becomes a vibrant Crimson hotspot. Harvard has, to its credit, already committed some $25 million to affordable housing in Allston. Commendable as that investment may be, it pales in comparison to the estimated $1 billion tab for the SEAS complex. Housing affordability is an almost intractable issue and often involves hefty amounts of bureaucracy, but Harvard, using its institutional heft, ought to at least make an effort to engage with the Allston government to push for the zoning changes that would make affordable housing projects more feasible. The University should, at the same time, remain mindful of other externalities of its presence in the area, ensuring that future projects remain environmentally friendly (as exemplified by the surprisingly ‘green’ SEAS building) and continue pushing for public transportation improvements in the area; our multi-million dollar pledge to a new planned MBTA stop is a good start.
The bottom line, for our Board, is that Harvard’s developments in Allston should serve its old residents just as much as its new ones. Every University decision — land purchase disclosures, urban investments, housing initiatives — must convey an understanding of the colossal impacts of our growth on some locals, and reflect a willingness to maximize the benefits they will reap.
While our Allston chapter will, in all likelihood, bring forth substantial benefits for academia and society alike, that progress must not come at the expense of the people whose community we are transforming. Harvard must keep engaging, humbly and respectfully, with the government and the local community in Allston while planning new projects, lest it falls into the all too common tendency to frame itself as an economic activity-spurring savior while sweeping away the concerns of those we claim to be helping.
Harvard is on track to make Allston a second Cambridge. But as we rush towards our new, expansive campus, we ought to remember that we aren’t the only ones — nor the first ones — to call the neighborhood home.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2007, Harvard professor Peter L. Galison wrote of Allston dreams and Allston nightmares.
At that time, just after the University had announced ambitious plans to expand its presence in Allston, Professor Galison’s piece was an argument for smart design: for a space that would bring together Harvard’s best scientists and humanists and that people would not want to leave as soon as the day was out. For, in other words, creating an Allston that would be a “fundamental piece of the dynamic center of Harvard University.”
Maybe Professor Galison got his dream. The SEC is an imperious, environmentally-friendly, mixed-use fortress for STEM. The neighboring Enterprise Research Campus will provide the restaurants, storefronts, and amenities of a vibrant, walkable urban center.
For Harvard, this is a triumph, the summit of a climb decades in the making. But with each angular, glistening building, Allston has become less a home for Allstonians and more a sandbox for Harvard’s billion-dollar dreams. Housing costs have risen. Streets have grown more congested. Locals have been pushed out. As Harvard has built its dreams, too many Allstonians have lived nightmares.
From 2011 to 2019, the average price of a home in Allston rose by 43 percent, average rent jumped by 36 percent, and, in the biggest change of all, median household income increased by 67 percent. Theoretically, this increase in median household income could just reflect an influx of wealthier people. However, Census data indicate that the population of Allston not living in group quarters (i.e. non-college-students) has hardly grown since 2010.
This is almost certainly not a story of a few well-monied professors and graduate students moving across the river to join the long-time residents of Allston. Common sense cautions that it almost certainly isn’t a story about thousands of low-income people miraculously doubling their income in just eight years, either.
This is a story about Allstonians being pushed out.
Like almost all American housing crises, supply is the issue. When high-demand areas like Allston don’t have enough places for people to live, available residences are subject to vicious bidding wars. In Allston, this has had profound consequences. A report by the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation, a housing non-profit, found that “rising rents have led to closing doors for renters, homeowners and homebuyers.” In an interview with The Crimson, Anthony P. D’Isidoro, president of the Allston Civic Association, described watching “absolutely absurdly ridiculous” price conditions displace locals from his hometown.
This all traces back to Harvard.
Harvard owns 360 acres of land in the neighborhood — about a third of Allston’s total landmass. These properties, which include athletics facilities, the Business School, and the SEC, serve predominantly Harvard affiliates while effectively foreclosing huge swathes of Allston to residential development. Consequently, as the Allston Brighton Community Development Corporation put it, “the lack of vacant land in Allston Brighton makes it nearly impossible to increase the affordable housing stock significantly.”
There are some notable exceptions, sure. Harvard has announced plans to construct around a thousand residential units across roughly 20 acres of land. It has donated $25 million to support housing affordability in Allston (though this financial support might not be needed if Harvard were required to pay its fair share of taxes). But, as soaring prices in the area demonstrate, neither 20 acres nor $25 million can fill a 360-acre void. No neighborhood can remain livable when almost a third of its land is totally off limits.
The responsibility for the Allston housing crisis is unambiguously Harvard’s, and it should make anyone who proclaims to care about justice absolutely furious.
There is no way to overstate how much housing crises harm people. Nothing decides the course of your life like where you grow up. Housing determines the air you breathe, the food you eat, the schools you attend, the people you know, the crimes you suffer. Where you begin your life, in a greater sense, decides where you will end it.
In this respect, the experience of housing crises across the country makes abundantly clear how Harvard’s Allston adventurism can hurt people — it has the power to make them poorer, sicker, more isolated, more unhappy, and, in the worst cases, homeless. It can kill.
In light of all of this, unless Harvard expands tenfold its material commitment to replacing the housing it has robbed from Allston, there is unequivocally one just answer to this abject failure: Stop building in Allston. Sell the unused land. Clear the way for developers to build housing on it.
It saddens me that, with this most recent staff editorial, the Editorial Board has failed to see that — an especially ironic failing given our not-so-distant precedent on UC Berkeley’s housing shortfall, in which we called on the university to build more housing because of the “particular value of access to education.” For this Board to recognize the imperative of housing for mostly well-off students at elite colleges but not low-income people in our own community is, at best, woefully inconsistent.
But this Board is not alone, and this misstep is no unique moral or intellectual failing. In this nation, the housing crisis rages on because we fail to imagine something better — to consider an alternative to uninspired and unwelcoming low-density sprawl. At Harvard, that means finding innovative new ways to increase density: Building up, down, sideways, every which way but out.
Professor Galison’s call for a shining new frontier of campus just across the Charles ended with a reminder that “times have changed” — that we can reimagine what our University is. Today, 15 years later, it is precisely because times have changed in Allston that I call on us to reimagine how we approach Allston yet again.
Harvard’s dreams and Allston’s nightmares are one and the same. It’s time for both to end.

Harvard told a federal judge last week that its insurance company was aware of a high-profile lawsuit challenging its race-conscious admissions process, saying the firm, Zurich American Insurance Company, should have to cover the University’s legal fees.
In a brief filed last week, lawyers for Harvard asked Judge Allison D. Burroughs to take its lawsuit against the insurance firm to trial. The filing comes one month after Zurich asked the court to throw out the case with a summary judgment.
Harvard sued Zurich last September, alleging the firm violated its contract by refusing to cover the legal fees Harvard racked up in its ongoing litigation against the anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which currently sits before the Supreme Court. Zurich says it should not have to cover Harvard’s legal fees because the school did not notify it of SFFA’s lawsuit in time.
Harvard purchased an excess insurance policy with Zurich in 2014 for legal fees exceeding $25 million. The school had also bought a different insurance policy with the American International Group the same year to cover the first $25 million.
Zurich did not pay Harvard for the excess costs once the cap was exceeded, telling the University that it “did not receive timely notice of the SFFA claim,” according to the school’s initial lawsuit.
Lawyers for Zurich wrote in an August filing that the University had to notify the firm within 90 days of the AIG’s policy period ending in order for it to cover the excess fees. The 90-day window ended in January 2016, but Harvard did not provide formal notice until May 2017, according to court filings.
The University has acknowledged in court filings that it did not formally notify Zurich until May 2017, but it argued in briefs submitted last week that Zurich’s own internal files indicate it was aware of the ongoing suit, which has received widespread national media coverage.
“Zurich surely knew about the SFFA Action in the year after it was filed, especially given the significant, ongoing attention that the suit received in local and national news,” Harvard’s lawyers wrote.
Spokespeople for Zurich American Insurance Company and Harvard declined to comment, citing pending litigation.

Just in time for peppermint and holiday drinks, Starbucks will return to Harvard Square in November — right down the road from its previous location on Massachusetts Avenue.
The new location will join the recently renovated El Jefe’s Taqueria and the new Central Rock Gym in the Abbot Building, which previously housed the famous Curious George Store.
Since 2018, three Starbucks coffee shops have closed in Harvard Square — the most recent one in November 2021, when the company closed its popular 1380 Massachusetts Ave. location.
A Starbucks spokesperson wrote in a November email that the decision to close the store last year came “after careful consideration” and a review “to ensure a healthy store portfolio.” The location has since been taken over by the Harvard Shop.
Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said many who frequent the Square were left mourning the loss of the last Starbucks shop after its doors closed.
“There has been a lot of lamenting since Starbucks at Harvard Yard closed, because, as you might remember, we had four Starbucks at one point,” Jillson said.
“You discover how much you really miss something when it’s no longer there,” she added.
Nearly a year later, students said they are excited about the return of Starbucks to the Square.
Peter A. Jin ‘25 said he thinks “it makes sense that there should be the option for Starbucks for anyone” on a college campus.
Jillson described the incoming manager of the new Starbucks, John Corredor, as “a veteran Starbucks employee” who is “very familiar with the Square.” Corredor previously worked at the Harvard Yard Starbucks location.
“Starbucks has been a long-time member of the Harvard Square Business Association. They are terrific community partners,” Jillson said.
Though the new Starbucks location in the Abbot building will be smaller, Jillson said the Square is “delighted to have them back.”
“We’re anxious for November. We’re anxious for that iconic location,” Jillson said.

Roughly 100 Harvard students convened at Memorial Church Saturday to celebrate first-generation, low-income members of the Class of 2026 in the inaugural FGLI welcoming ceremony.
The event was hosted by First-Generation, Low-Income Harvard, or FLI Harvard, a campus group founded last year. Freshmen and upperclassmen alike gathered to hear student, alumni, and faculty speakers, as well as musical performances.
Laila A. Nasher ’25 — the founder and chair of FLI Harvard — said in an interview the organization aims to “create institutional support, celebration and advocacy for first-generation, low-income students.” Harvard FLI is a student program sponsored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.
“I really wanted the incoming first-generation, low-income student class to feel that as soon as they start their journey on this campus, they're welcomed, they're greeted, without ever having to feel that they have to let go of that identity — that they're aware of the resources and the programs that are offered to them,” she said.
Nasher emceed the ceremony and introduced the performers and speakers, including Mariachi Véritas de Harvard and former prime minister of Sweden, Stefan Löfven.
Löfven delivered the keynote address, telling students to recognize their well-deserved place at Harvard.
David Johnson Aboge ’25, FLI mentorship co-chair, said he hopes the event would elevate FGLI experiences.
“This is the first of so many things drawing the school’s attention and the students’ attention to the economic stratifications that we have in the school,” Aboge said.
Ethan C. Kelly ’25, FLI Harvard’s communications director, said he believes events like the FLI Welcome will be “institutionalized.”
“It's quite crazy to me to think that this is the first of its type at Harvard,” he said. “But also in a way that's very Harvard-esque and also not surprising at all that this is the first time this is happening.”
Eric Olvera ’23 said he was shocked as a senior that events tailored to FGLI students had not regularly occurred in the past.
“It blows my mind that this isn't a thing that has happened regularly the past few years,” he said. “Talking about FGLI issues is sort of a new thing.”
Overall, attendees praised the event and its speakers.
Daniel Kocot ’26 said that he felt a “little scared” and “really alone” joining Harvard’s campus as a first-generation, low-income student, but the event’s speakers made him feel “powerful.”
“What stuck with me most is, no matter your background, no matter where you're from, you have a place here and you have the potential to have an amazing impact on the world,” he said. “And I felt like that really resonated with me and again with a lot of my friends.”
Steven Giraldo ’26 said the event was “beyond excellent.”
“The speakers were genuine,” he said. “They were very clear and they really validated our experiences here as first-generation, low-income students.”
Some attendees said the ceremony reinforced a sense of belonging.
Silas Camp ’26 said hearing other FGLI people’s experiences and learning about resources gave him “a lot of hope.”
“Belonging in an institution is a very hard thing to come to terms with and I think that this event helped a lot with that,” he said.
Ivanna Garibay ’26 was also grateful for the feeling of belonging that the event created.
“I know everybody feels that we don't belong here — or at least that's how I feel sometimes — but I think these types of events and types of community building that PRIMUS and other organizations here at Harvard create really make a person like me and other students feel at home and feel that we belong here.”
Nasher said her organization focuses on “building traditions” and mentioned upcoming events that include FGLI student formals, carnivals, and faculty dinners.
FGLI Visibility Week, the organization’s largest upcoming event, will take place from Nov. 4 to Nov. 11, Nasher said.
“We wanted to make sure it coincided with the national First Generation Day of Celebration,” she said. “We are hosting a lot of workshops, different events centered around really trying to make the first-generation community on campus as visible as possible.”
Correction: September 26, 2022
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Harvard FLI is an effort on the part of Harvard Primus and the Harvard Foundation. In fact, it is sponsored by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations.

The Harvard Undergraduate Association discussed its upcoming budget process and the formation of a student election commission at its weekly meeting on Saturday.
The meeting saw a change of scenery as the team gathered in the HUA office, rather than the Collaborative Commons, in the Smith Center. The turnout included seven HUA officers including the co-presidents and one student attendee.
HUA Co-Presidents LyLena D. Estabine ’24 and Travis Allen Johnson ’24 kicked off the meeting by unveiling the Association’s budget process for the 2022-2023 academic year. HUA leadership will submit their proposal by Monday afternoon and meet with the Dean of Students Office Thursday to finalize the budget.
Estabine also presented the Association’s plans for the formation of a student election commission. Last week, the results of the organization’s first referendum were declared void on the grounds that a student election commission had not yet been established.
“The election commission will work with the HUA officers and co-presidents to set standards for voting operation and ensure fair voting processes with regards to referenda, constitutional amendments, and elections,” she said.
The application for the HUA election commission opened Friday evening and will close on Wednesday.
Other HUA officers shared updates on their respective teams’ projects.
Johnson presented a new HUA initiative called Fall Town Halls. The HUA will organize three town halls during the fall semester to better facilitate communication with the students, he said.
The first town hall will likely take place in mid-October, Johnson said.
“Something we've been really debating or discussing as a team is meeting people where they are, so not always having to tell them to come to us at our meetings, but also going to them,” he said. “We want to hear directly from the students about the types of projects and initiatives that they'd like to see HUA work on and prioritize.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 1,000 backpacks symbolizing the annual toll of college student suicide in the United States were spread throughout Harvard Yard on Friday in a display seeking to raise awareness about student mental health.
The display, called “Send Silence Packing,” was put together by the Harvard chapter of Active Minds, an organization focused on addressing the mental health struggles of young adults. It was the second year in a row the group organized the display in Harvard Yard.
The backpacks, some of which belonged to students who died by suicide, were donated by people who have lost loved ones. Many backpacks were accompanied by a laminated sheet of paper telling the story of the student who once wore it.
The display was first put on by an Active Minds chapter in Washington, D.C., in 2008. Since then, “Send Silence Packing” has been shown more than 200 times, reaching over 1 million visitors.
“We’re just trying to provide support for individuals on many levels,” said Kathryn S. Boit ’23, co-president of the Harvard chapter of Active Minds.
Members of the organization were positioned throughout the Yard on Friday to answer questions from passersby and provide resources if necessary. Several clinicians from Harvard University Health Services’ Counseling and Mental Health Services also staffed the event.
“I’m really struck by how honest and vulnerable the conversations are with people who are visiting the display,” Boit said. “Nobody’s immune to suicidal thoughts or behavior, and it’s just something that hits home for me.”
Planning for the event started in March, Boit said.
Michelle Y. Canas-Garcia ’26, who passed through the Yard while the display was up, said she thought the demonstration was an important way to raise awareness for suicide prevention.
“It’s a little less triggering than fully speaking on it because it’s almost like you’re reading it, and you’re kind of able to differentiate yourself and empathize more,” Canas-Garcia said of the display.
Claire Yang ’26, who perused the exhibit on Friday afternoon, said the display was “very moving.”
“I really appreciate that people put together the time to organize something like this,” she said. “As someone who has had friends that struggled with mental health and depression, I think it’s something very important that should be talked about.”
Santiago Salazar ’26, an Active Minds member who worked a shift in the Yard on Friday, said the display created a sense of solidarity around an important topic.
“The most important part of this display is knowing that you are not alone in case you need to reach out for help,” Salazar said.
Boit said she hoped the event would help encourage students to point their friends toward getting help when they need it.
“How we talk about mental health — especially to a friend — could be a matter of whether or not someone gets treatment, whether or not someone seeks out help,” Boit said.
Brammy Rajakumar ’23, co-president of Active Minds, said it is important to have open discussions about mental health at Harvard given the high-pressure environment at the school, adding that it can be challenging for students to give themselves a break.
“There’s a range of needs,” she said. “These all deserve to be met, and they all deserve access to resources.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard agreed to return the remains of 19 likely enslaved individuals to their descendants in a report published last week. But some descendants of enslaved individuals and Native American scholars voiced concerns about a lack of specificity on repatriation timelines.
Tamara K. Lanier — the plaintiff of a high profile lawsuit alleging the University illegally possesses daguerreotypes of two of her enslaved ancestors, Renty and Delia — condemned Harvard for “saying all the right things” while failing to return the photographs to her.
“They have to recognize that now they are under an obligation to do the right thing and can no longer cover up their past indiscretions, how they have in the past flouted the law,” Lanier said.
Lanier questioned Harvard’s motivations in promising to ethically steward and repatriate human remains in its collections in light of her own court battle with the University.
A Harvard spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.
Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, Harvard is required to return the human remains and associated cultural items removed from Native American lands to their descendants. Since 2020, a separate NAGPRA committee housed within the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography has overseen the returns of Native American human remains.
Last week’s report urged Harvard to accelerate the return of approximately 6,500 Native American human remains at Harvard. Some Native American scholars and advocates called for the immediate return of Native American human remains and voiced concerns about the language used to describe Native American ancestors.
University of Cincinnati Associate Professor Kenneth B. Tankersley wrote that the University has not published “timelines when all Native American remains, funerary objects, and items of cultural patrimony will be repatriated.”
Harvard should “cease all research on the collections and repatriate all of the Native American and African American human remains,” Tankersley wrote.
Anthony Trujillo, a Harvard Ph.D. candidate in American Studies and member of the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, also said the University should prioritize returning the human remains within its collections immediately.
In October 2021, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography announced an interim policy that bars any research, including analytical sampling, on Native American human remains or associated funerary objects “without permission from authorized Tribal representatives.”
The moratorium applies to both culturally affiliated artifacts — referring to the 30 percent of the Peabody’s collection of Native American ancestral remains that have been connected to at least one tribe — and those deemed culturally unidentifiable.
The report on human remains also recommends a research and teaching moratorium on any human remains referred to the newly created Human Remains Returns Committee, a group charged with repatriating the human remains of the 19 individuals who were likely enslaved and overseeing the return of other human remains.
Colleen Medicine, program director of the Association on American Indian Affairs and member of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, also said she felt the report has a “very cold” tone and does not include the language Native Americans use.
“We always capitalize the 'A' in Ancestors,” Medicine said. “We were taught that when you do use that capital, it lets our ancestors know that we’re still thinking of them in that sacred way.”
Kiani Ku'uleimomi Akina ’25, a Native Hawaiian student, also wished the report had included an acknowledgment of stolen Indigenous land, given how Harvard is located on the ancestral lands of the Massachusett Tribe.
Still, Trujillo said he was grateful that the report criticized Harvard’s practices in obtaining and caring for the remains.
But he added that he hoped for more specificity in the report regarding next steps. As Harvard works to implement its new policies and return human remains, Trujillo said he wants the University to provide regular progress reports on an annual, if not biannual, basis.
Jaidyn J. Probst ’23, co-president of Natives at Harvard College and member of the Lower Sioux Indian Community, also said she would like to see concrete evidence of returns and dialogues between the University and tribes.
While the vast majority of human remains are housed at the Peabody Museum, Trujillo and Probst both said repatriation is a University-wide issue.
“At the end of the day, it’s an institutional problem,” Probst said.
In a message to affiliates earlier this month, University President Lawrence S. Bacow described the report as a “clear roadmap for our community as we seek to fulfill our obligations to those individuals whose remains are held by the University.”
But the implementation of the report’s 13 recommendations — as well as the administration of Harvard’s Legacy of Slavery initiative and its $100 million commitment — will largely be left to Bacow’s successor when he leaves the role in June.
Trujillo said he hopes the repatriation of the human remains is “front and center” in the presidential search.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — In last week’s season opener, the Harvard offense got off to a sluggish start, posting only seven points through the first three quarters before finding its stride in the closing period and coming back to win the game in overtime. So for Crimson fans who were watching the fourth quarter of yesterday’s Ivy League opener against Brown, there was an uneasy sense of déjà vu. After leading 35-7 with 15 minutes to go, the Crimson had to face down a potential game-tying drive from the Bears with under two minutes remaining and score standing at 35-28. Still, Harvard (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) hung tight and got the stop, coming away with a gritty win on the road over Brown (1-1, 0-1 Ivy).
“We’ll take the win, very proud of our kids,” said head coach Tim Murphy after the game. “But we certainly have plenty still to work on.”
Harvard relied on a sharp and impressive performance from senior quarterback Charlie Dean, who completed 20 of his 29 attempts for 289 total yards and four scores while adding another 22 yards with his feet. Dean’s efficiency, along with continued excellence from senior running back Aidan Borguet, made for a balanced offensive attack that proved overwhelming for the Bears defense in the first half. With the win, Dean moves to 5-0 as the Harvard starter across this season and last season.
However, the star of the first few drives for Harvard was indisputably Harvard’s top target, senior wide receiver Kym Wimberly. After the Crimson defense held firm against Brown on the opening drive of the game, Dean looked to Wimberly early and often on the ensuing Harvard drive. On second and short from just over midfield, Dean found the senior wideout and Slidell, La. native for his second catch of the game, penetrating the Bears secondary for a 21-yard gain. This would be one of three 2o-plus yard catches for Wimberly on the day, the next two of which would garner points for Harvard. On third down and nine later in the drive, Dean hit Wimberly over the middle and the senior evaded the tackle of Bears cornerback Shane Prevot, scampering another twenty yards after the catch for the first touchdown of the game.
Wimberly, asked about his clear connection with Dean, emphasized the time that the two have spent practicing and developing together: “We spent a whole summer together working out, so this is a product of the effort I put in before we got to campus and after.”
The scoring catch was Wimberly’s first of the season after posting a seven-catch game last week against Merrimack but being held out of the end zone. The Crimson and the Bears traded punts for the next four drives, with the longest offensive gain being a 26-yard run by Brown back Stockton Owen that was immediately followed up by a sack and an offensive holding penalty. On the last possession of the first quarter, Brown drove down the field into Harvard territory, with head coach James Perry making a gutsy call to go for it on fourth down with his team well inside its own territory. The decision to challenge the country’s second-best fourth down defense in 2021 paid off, with Owen ramming his way through the Crimson defense for the first down. The drive culminated with no pay-off for the Bears, though, as the Harvard secondary clamped down on third and six and Brown kicker Christopher Maron pushed a 45-yard field goal try wide left.
Still up 7-0 and with plenty of time to play in the first half, the Crimson seized on the momentum of the Brown missed field goal and went on to score on its next two drives. On the first, it was all Borguet and Wimberly, as they gained 62 out of the 73 yards on the drive. Wimberly capped off the scoring drive with his second 26-yard touchdown grab of the game. This second touchdown bore resemblance to his first score; Wimberly found space in the middle of the Brown secondary and used his speed and strength after the catch to secure the score for the Crimson.
The Brown offense was stifled on its next possession, handing the ball back to Harvard on its own thirty-two with four minutes left in the half. Dean proceeded to show his poise and patience, as he converted on two big third downs, first with his legs and then tossing a 12-yard dart to sophomore running back Tim Dowd as he stared down pressure from the Bears’ pass rush. Dean was hit hard on the play and the officiating team called a roughing the passer penalty, the first of a number of personal fouls for both teams. The Crimson capitalized two plays later, with Coach Murphy exploiting a favorable match-up: six-foot-four senior tight end Haven Montefalco lept high up in the air to beat coverage by Brown linebacker Caleb Moorhead, who never got his head around to locate the ball. Montefalco has mostly played the role of blocking halfback for most of his Harvard tenure but paced the Harvard tight ends’ room yesterday in yards and catches.
Suddenly down three scores, the Bears came out into the field and attempted to put some points on the board before the end of the half, but with only 1:09 left in the half, Brown sophomore signal-caller Jake Willcox had to try to force the ball down the field. On the last play of the half, Harvard senior cornerback Alex Washington came away with an interception of Willcox along the left sideline and ran the ball back 30 yards, which was the only turnover for either team on the day.
Harvard entered the locker room with a 21-0 lead, only halving the 42-0 advantage it held halfway through its rout of the Bears last season. The defense, led by senior defensive lineman Truman Jones, who was selected 148th Captain of Harvard Football, was undoubtedly stifling enough to quiet the home crowd, as the Bears were held to just 112 total yards of offense and converted on only four of 11 third-down tries.
The Crimson received the ball to start the second half with a chance to run away with the game, and Dean took that mission to heart. On the opening play of the drive, he handed the ball off to Borguet, who then pivoted and tossed it back to the quarterback for a perfect flea-flicker. The Brown secondary was fooled, as Dean reared back and found sophomore receiver Ledger Hatch streaking just past midfield. Hatch never broke stride, leaving his Bears defender in the dust behind him for an 81-yard touchdown that seemed to take the air out of the home side at Brown Stadium. Early on in his second season, Hatch has shown an affinity for the big play, as he hauled in a 41-yard bomb in the opening game against Merrimack in addition to his huge touchdown catch yesterday.
But the Bears fought back valiantly, as Hatch’s score seemed to finally bring its dormant offense to life. On its ensuing drive, Brown’s talented running back room showed the burst they brought to the Bears’ comeback win over Bryant in its season opener. First, senior Allen Smith carried the ball twice in the opening series of the drive to move the chains. Then, a few plays later, with the Bears facing third down and six, Murphy and Harvard defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ’99 brought strong pressure against Willcox. With junior linebacker Brock Locnikar in his face, Willcox saw Stockton Owen shake his defender on a flare route out of the backfield and hit him in stride. Owen accelerated out of the catch and outran three Crimson defenders, streaking down the left sideline for the Bears’ first touchdown of the day. On the day, Owen collected over 100 all-purpose yards and that score.
With the Bears’ first scoring drive seeming to underscore the importance of taking what the defense gives you, Harvard needed just three plays on their next drive to strike back. On third and short from the Crimson 33, Borguet took a hand-off from Dean on a draw play and immediately ran into a cluster of lineman. However, the senior bounced out to his left and saw a massive hole. Once he escaped the attempted tackle of Moorhead near the line of scrimmage, he remained untouched all the way to the end zone, capping an exhilarating three-drive opening to the third quarter that saw both teams score touchdowns of more than 40 yards.
For the second straight game, Borguet showed how dangerous he can be when he sees an open field in front of him. In the opening week victory against Merrimack, his 48-yard touchdown run narrowed the Crimson deficit to seven, and in this game, his score would prove to be the deciding factor. With 258 yards through his team’s first two games, Borguet leads the Ivy League in rush yards and yards per carry (7.2) early in the campaign.
If the opening sequence of the second half had moments that brought both teams’ crowd to its feet, the remainder of the game produced growing excitement for the Brown side of the stadium and growing anxiety from the visitors’ end. Harvard wouldn’t score again after Borguet’s run four minutes into the third quarter, as Brown staged a second-half comeback that fell just short of clawing all the way back.
“It was like two different games,” said Murphy of the stark contrast between the halves.
After the two teams traded two punts each following the Borguet touchdown, the Bears used the speed of their offensive weapons again to immediately gain favorable field position to start their last drive of the third quarter. This time, it was Bears receiver Wes Rockett, a six-foot, 185-pound burner who took Harvard sophomore punter Sebastien Tasko’s 35-yard kick 53 yards the other way, setting up the Bears at the Crimson 35-yard line. The Browns then ran 11 plays to go the 35 yards and make it into the end zone, punctuating the scoring drive with a seven-yard run by Smith.
Harvard went three-and-out on the next drive, with Dean looking to connect with Wimberly on two occasions but not converting on either try. When Brown got the ball back with 13 minutes, the Bears played with urgency. On this drive, Bears junior receiver Graham Walker, who was the team’s leading receiver against Bryant, converted a huge third down at the Brown 36 and took the ball 25 yards into Harvard territory. A couple of plays later, and after Harvard committed a roughing the passer penalty that took Brown into the red zone, Willcox threw a bullet pass to Rockett out wide, who then pivoted and slipped away from the tackle of senior defensive back James Herring and waltzed into the end zone to cut the Harvard lead to 14.
If the Harvard sideline was beginning to feel that Brown was creeping back into the game, that concern wasn’t reflected on the next Crimson drive, another three-and-out. On third and short, Dean completed a pass to senior running back Sone Ntoh but Wimberly was called for offensive pass interference, moving the Crimson back within their own 10-yard line and forcing a Harvard punt two plays later. On the day, the Crimson were called for eight penalties for 86 yards, following a Merrimack game that was also a busy one for the officiating team.
Murphy absorbed some of the blame for Harvard’s languid second-half performance offensively on his play-calling, saying, “I probably got a little conservative. The reality is that in this day and age, certainly from Brown teams, you never have enough points.”
With the ball back in Willcox’s hands after the Harvard punt, the Bears kept rolling on offense. On second and long, he escaped a swarm of Harvard defenders to complete a six-yard pass to tight end Christopher Boyle. Then, two plays later, he rolled to his right and floated a pretty touch pass to senior wideout Hayes Sutton along the right sideline. But the gem of the drive came on third and four from the Harvard 25. Willcox threw a rainbow to the right corner of the end zone, and Browns wide receiver Allan Houston III made a miraculous play: with senior cornerback Diassa Diakite, who had made a clutch defense on a deep throw two plays earlier, in coverage, Houston reached over Diakite’s head and deflected the ball straight up. For an interminably long second, the ball floated in the air over receiver and defender before coming down into the outstretched hands of Houston for a sensational catch. Suddenly, Brown was within a score.
Once again, Harvard had the chance to respond and put away the Bears, but penalties got in the way. The Crimson gained two first downs, but the drive stalled around midfield due to a backbreaking offensive holding call on senior offensive lineman Scott Elliot. Harvard did succeed at burning clock, though, as Tasko punted the ball to the Bears with just over 90 seconds in the game.
In the Merrimack game, the defense came up with a huge stop in the fourth quarter to give the ball back to Dean and complete the comeback. Yesterday, the Crimson’s decorated defense again bent but didn’t break. With Brown pushed to fourth down deep within its own territory, the Crimson almost came away with the final stop, as senior cornerback Khalil Dawsey wrapped up Rockett on a pass over the middle that looked to be short of the line to gain. The Bears were given a favorable spot on forward progress, however, moving the chains for Brown. On first down, Willcox stepped forward in the pocket and completed a back-shoulder throw to Rockett for a twenty-yard gain.
With the Browns moving the ball steadily but time running out, Harvard stayed disciplined and stuck firm to its defensive techniques. On third down at the Crimson 38-yard line, Willcox sent a pass deep down the field for Rockett, but Dawsey swiped the jump ball away at the last second. With under ten seconds on the clock and fourth down, it was do-or-die for Brown. Harvard stayed firm. Willcox’s throw sailed well over the head of Graham Walker, and Brown’s furious comeback attempt finally came up just short.
With the gritty victory, Harvard teams coached by Murphy moved to 23-5 in Ivy League openers, and the Crimson opened up the season 2-0 for the second consecutive year. For Brown, the misery against their conference rival continued: the Bears haven’t bested the Crimson since 2011.
For Harvard, the team will look to emulate its offensive and defensive success in the first half in its next contest against Holy Cross, a team that Murphy called “quite possibly might be the best team we play all year.” The Crimson will take on the Crusaders at home next Saturday, Oct. 1, at 1:00 p.m.

In 2011, I woke up at 6 a.m. to watch Kate and William’s wedding. It serves as one of those weird core memories that sticks with you, for no apparent reason. I wouldn’t characterize myself as a royal family fanatic, but I do enjoy keeping up with Prince George and Princess Charlotte’s annual back-to-school photos, and I do croon over Muick and Sandy (the late Queen’s two Corgis). When the news broke on Sept. 8, I decided to make nine-year-old Elizabeth happy and wake up at the crack of dawn to watch Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral live.
I wanted to make a morning of it and invited some friends to join me at 5 a.m. in the Eliot JCR. The funeral was on Monday, Sept. 19; naturally, the evening before, I ventured over to Cardullo’s Gourmet Shoppe in Harvard Square in search of British scones and tea to serve. They didn’t have exactly what I had envisioned, but I returned to Eliot victorious with Walkers Shortbread (Scottish, not English, but works with the ~Commonwealth~), “Boston Tea Party” Tea Bags (again, not 100% English, but relates to the Revolutionary War AND Boston so I found it doubly fitting), Pumpkin Cinnamon Donuts (not British related — they just looked yummy), and a mini British Flag (for good measure). It was the perfect spread.
I decided my homework could wait and I hit the hay early to maximize sleep and emerge energized for the morning. I climbed into bed around 10:30 p.m., but out of excitement, fell asleep after 11 p.m. Despite setting my alarm for 4:45 a.m., the anticipation woke me up at 4:15 a.m. and I couldn't fall back asleep. So, I pulled my sweatshirt and sweatpants on, stuffed my mugs, my roommate’s kettle, and Cardullo’s treats into my bag, and beelined across the courtyard to the JCR. Outside, I was met with a cool mist and creeping fog, which felt very English.
I didn’t reserve the JCR because I assumed no one would be there at 5 a.m. And I was right! The inviting, Gryffindor-esque common room was mine for the morning. A little after 5, two friends joined me, and by 6:30 a.m, three more friends had arrived. One even made the trek from Mather!
Funeral customaries began at 8 a.m. BST (3 a.m. Eastern time) and the funeral ceremony promptly started at 11 a.m. (6 a.m.). The 5 a.m. kick-off was the perfect time — cozied up on the very-sinkable couches and armchairs, we observed the royal formalities and watched the British military and royal family process into Westminster Abbey. I spent my summer in London, so I enjoyed seeing sights that I was familiar with. After sipping on tea, passing around the shortbread, and demolishing the pumpkin donuts, the watch party broke up around 7:30 a.m. We went our separate ways to begin our days, bleary-eyed but invigorated by the early morning.
Overall, it was a very special morning that I’ll remember for a long time. It made me so grateful for my friends (who willingly woke up at 5 a.m. to join me — yes, I knew I was asking a lot from them) and it was incredible to experience such a historical moment, even through my laptop screen 3,270 miles across the pond. I’ll happily sacrifice my eight hours of sleep for 4 a.m. wake-ups and moments like these (though hopefully a happier occasion in the future).
