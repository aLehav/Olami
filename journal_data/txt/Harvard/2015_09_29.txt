After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lana has had a hard time pleasing critics, and she knows it: “We both know that it’s not fashionable to love me” is the first sing-song utterance on her new album “Honeymoon.” This state of affairs is about to change. In “Honeymoon,” the candy layer that coated “Born to Die” and was already thinning on “Ultraviolence” has ceded completely to something sadder, something darker, something more bitter—and something more coherent and compelling.
“Honeymoon” finds a more retiring Lana Del Rey than the bubbly eternal adolescent or the effusive and cruel mistress of her two earlier albums. “Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on / It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song,” she sings on “The Blackest Day.” The heartbreak of “Summertime Sadness” and the gleeful self-assurance of “Off to the Races” have given way to weariness: “All I wanna do is get high by the beach” (“High by the Beach”), “I’ve got nothing much to live for / Ever since I found my fame” (“God Knows I Tried”), and “You got your moment now, you got your legacy / Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything” (“Swan Song”) showcase the album’s typical sentiments.
This persona of the exhausted, faded starlet is perhaps an odd one for Lana to adopt—she is only 30, after all—and it makes “Honeymoon” more thematically focused than her previous albums. “Born to Die” saw her with young men, old men, rich men, poor men, saw her happy and heartbroken, and stylistically bounced between old-fashioned chanteuse (“Million Dollar Man”) and hip young pop star (“National Anthem”). Similarly, “Ultraviolence” was rueful and arrogant by turns: “Cruel World” and “Fucked My Way Up to the Top” are not quite compatible in tone. By contrast, the same light sadness suffuses all of “Honeymoon.” Even her recording of the angst-ridden standard “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” reflects this programmatic melancholy, reaching past the immature, up-tempo recording by The Animals to the slow, mournful original of Nina Simone.
This is not to say that all the songs on “Honeymoon” are equal in quality. The melodically lovely “Salvatore,” about a Sicilian crime boss in American-occupied Italy, is marred by the absurd conceit of the of the lyrics. “Religion” is a boring collection of the usual pop-music blasphemies, without the lyrical punch of Kanye West’s “Hell of a Life” (“No more drugs for me / Pussy and religion are all I need”) or the inventiveness of her own “Money Power Glory,” which cleverly mimics a popular Catholic doxology setting. “24” is a musically jejune and lyrically predictable invective whose lush orchestration cannot overcome its fundamental failings.
Set against these partial or complete failures, however, is a bevy of truly haunting songs. The title track, languid and decadent, features Lana involved with one of her beloved bad boys. She is no longer delighted or distressed but resigned to the mere accidents of the relationship: All she wants is for him to “Say you want me too.” “High by the Beach” is an expression of frustration with the life of fame, underlined by dark trap drum machines and synths. “Swan Song” expresses the same frustration through a quietly desperate fantasy about running away from the life of fame.
While Lana may protest her desire for a Greta Garbo-like disappearance from the public stage, it seems unlikely. With “Honeymoon,” she has finally proven herself able to capture the consistency that critics found lacking from her earlier recordings. Having navigated through the excitement and pitfalls of a new pop star, Lana is now on the way to the mature peak of her career. Who would quit before the best is over?

British Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie has had a matchless career. Adored by fans and respected by reviewers, the author of “Midnight’s Children” and “The Satanic Verses” has received that combination of popular and critical acclaim that is increasingly rare as the cultural and literary landscape fragments into smaller and smaller factions. Together with the assassination attempts and the murder of a number of his literary associates, this success might tempt another author to retire from public life. Rushdie, however, is still very much in the game: This month saw the release of “Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights,” his first adult novel in nearly a decade and the focus of a recent reading at the Harvard Book Store. Prior to his talk, he spoke candidly with The Harvard Crimson.
“It’s kind of the wildest book I’ve written in a long time,” Rushdie says. The book’s action looks at a New York very similar to our own, but one in which an enormous storm has blown away the barriers between the ordinary world and the world of the jinns and devs, supernatural beings of Middle Eastern mythology, who promptly set about causing problems for human beings.
“It’s the most extreme version of the literature of the fantastic that I’ve attempted,” he says. “I think if you’re going to write a book of this type—if you’re going to use the fantastic—the reason for doing it is to say something about the world as it is…. I wanted to convey a sense of people feeling somehow the familiar has been dislocated and the unfamiliar rules, and it’s as if the rules of the game have changed and people don’t know what the new rules are.”
Rushdie regards this project as cutting against the grain of the current literary establishment. “It’s strange because right now there is a great literary vogue for the opposite of this, for books that are hypernaturalistic and which appear to draw very directly on the personal circumstances of the writer,” he says. “And that seems to be where a lot of readers have been drawn lately, this very intimate sort of material, which is the opposite of public fiction, and is certainly the opposite of the kind of surrealism in this book.”
Despite Rushdie’s decision to draw on the fantastic, the book is not entirely devoid of the author’s reality. In choosing New York for the book’s setting, Rushdie devotes loving attention to the city in which he has lived since 2000 while still maintaining a common thread with his earlier work and lived experiences. “I find [New York] oddly familiar, because it in many ways it reminds me of the city of Bombay where I grew up,” he says. “Even physically, Manhattan Island and downtown Bombay are about the same shape and size and have the same crowded population and atmosphere.”
Rushdie feels that “Two Years Eight Months and Twenty Eight Nights” stands at a particular developmental junction in his oeuvre. “I started out trying to make sense of where I’d come from—India and Pakistan—and then I began to feel that, because of my life being spent traveling between many countries, certain subjects naturally presented themselves to me, one of which was migration, another of which was just the question of how, in this shrinking world, the world joins up—how one part of the world affects another part of the world,” he says.
The author’s interest in the interactions between diverse and conflicting systems of thought does not end with his fiction but extends to his opinions about the current intellectual climate of the West. “One of the things that worries me a great deal about the academy is the rise of political correctness and the things like trigger warnings and just the growth among students of the idea that the university is a place where you should be protected from ideas that you don’t like, whereas it used to be that the university was precisely the place where your own thoughts and ideas should be challenged—otherwise, why go?,” he says. “The idea that students have a right to be protected from things that might upset them is, to my mind, the antithesis of what universities should be trying to do, because at universities it should be the ideas themselves that are protected, not the students from them. And I really worry about this curious, militant conservatism which allows some students to think that they must protect themselves against new things.”

At one point during her master class on Sept. 26, Dwana Smallwood felt that the dancers were just slightly off on the combination they were practicing. She paused the dancing but left the music on. “Listen to the music. Tap the beat out,” Smallwood said. And so a room of panting, sweat-slicked dancers each momentarily stood still, rhythmically drumming one foot. “You’ve got to be in the music,” she instructed.
This moment illustrates Smallwood’s approach to dance. She emphasizes organic, bold, rhythmic movements that require an unselfconscious command of the body in addition to technical proficiency. “Her movement quality is almost ethereal,” says Claire Johnson, a resident of Arlington and participant in the class. “She’s so organized in her movement; it’s something to aspire to.”
After achieving iconic status as a principal dancer with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Smallwood served as the director of student affairs for the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa. Currently, she is the executive director of Dwana Smallwood Performing Arts Center. Such a resume speaks to Harvard’s objectives for the master class series, according to Jill Johnson, director of dance at Harvard. “I so admire [Smallwood’s] approach to dance education, her belief in the power of arts and dance in our own internal community but also in the greater world community,” she says. “She’s such an artist citizen, and that’s really important to us here.”
This past weekend, Smallwood visited Harvard Dance Center to teach a fast-paced, two-hour contemporary master class to 31 dancers. In addition to a set of sore muscles, dancers gained an exclusive look at the way Smallwood moves and thinks as a dancer and choreographer. “It’s one of those analogue things—like music, like live poetry reading, like theater,” Jill Johnson says. “You can capture them in certain ways, but there’s nothing quite like being there.”
At the end of class, Smallwood gave some inspiring words to the dancers. “It’s a great thing that it’s not a dying art form, that we still have people excited to learn,” she said. “That means a lot to me that, when I leave this earth, we’ll still be dancing. Don’t let anybody kill your joy or initial joy for stepping into this role as a dancer”
Andrea Rustid, a student at Boston University, especially enjoyed the class. Referred by one of her teachers, she found the experience refreshingly unique. “It was different because I usually do ballet, so this was a really different experience for me,” she says. “To loosen up is not something I’m used to. I wish I could come back and do it again.”
Claire Johnson was especially excited to join the class because of Smallwood’s Ailey experience. “I’ve had a chance to train at the Ailey,” she says. “I did a summer intensive with them when I was just out of college.” But the experience spoke to her on a deeper level as well. “I grew up on Cape Cod,” she says. “There were no black people at all. And so, to be doing ballet, where there is a complete lack of diversity to begin with...was always a huge struggle for me, and I never felt like I fit in. When I got to Ailey, and I saw that there were dancers who looked like me and could move, it was so amazing. To now be actually having the opportunity to see one up close and speak with her, it’s just amazing.”

Synth-pop isn’t the most revered of genres, in large part because it is extremely easy to do badly. Scottish trio Chvrches, however, are up-and-coming stars of the genre—their previous album, “The Bones of What You Believe,” received critical acclaim for its polish, catchiness, and unique sonic signature. Despite the frequently quick turnover for synthy artists, Chvrches shows no signs of falling into a sophomore slump on their second album, “Every Open Eye.”
The album kicks off with “Never Ending Circles,” a rousing anthemic song whose cascading, echoing synth trill, punctuated by the occasional ethereal coo from lead singer Lauren Mayberry, gives it a certain sense of space and openness that characterizes Chvrches’ particular brand of music. ”Empty Threat,” with its preternaturally catchy, rolling melody, is also also a highlight, as is “Make it Gold,” a number almost arena-rockish in its ardor. Chvrches’ claim to want to “Take the best parts of ourselves / And make them gold” is stirring enough to override any accusations of kitsch. And the album’s closer, “Afterglow”, is aptly named—it’s a beautiful, balladic number that serves as a worthwhile and soothing coda to the high-energy album.
The album’s lyrics are filled with quasi-angsty, millennial buzzwords such as “regret,” “bones,” “letting go,” and “confusion.” But the rhetoric of the album never devolves into meaninglessness—from a purely content-based standpoint, Chvrches could be called unoriginal, but the lyrics of “Every Open Eye” never quite dip into the vacuous or the banal. Its messages still hold power, well-trod though they are. The blend of resignation, guilt, and blamelessness seen in “Bury It,” for instance, feels familiar but not quite trite; the sentiment behind the line “I never promised you anything I couldn't do” still packs an emotional punch. And even their familiarity isn’t a glaring flaw—the sheer inventiveness and polish of Chvrches’ music goes a long way towards excusing the slightly stale lyrics. Besides, up to a certain point, it doesn’t really matter what Mayberry is actually singing about—her voice is so valuable as a sonic instrument that the content it carries becomes almost secondary.
However, the unique sound that Mayberry brings to the album, distinctive as it may be, cannot prove a potent independent source of interest for the full length of the album. Toward the end, the album’s crystalline, upbeat synth-poppiness risks wearying the listener. Of course, there are the occasional diversions from the band’s typical sound, but none are particularly successful—“High Enough To Carry You Over” is the token male-sung number in the album, and though Martin Doherty’s vocal performance is a departure from the “Every Open Eye” standard, the musical aspects of the song hew to that expectation. Without the edge provided by Mayberry’s voice, the track becomes distinctive only with respect to the rest of the songs on the album—on its own, however, it’s unremarkable, and certainly not one of the band’s stronger offerings. “Down Side of Me” fares slightly better, with its minor-key tonality and more subdued mood nicely offsetting the expansiveness and poppy intensity of the rest of the album. It does, however, start to feel slow and repetitive, and eventually settles into Chvrches’ standard anthemic chorus instead of sticking to its guns and staying somber.
The sheer polish and innovation of the album’s offerings, however, prevent it from ever growing truly exhausting. Its tracks are fairly homogenous, but, taken individually, the offerings are all fairly high-quality pieces, able demonstrations of Chvrches’ well-honed pop sensibilities and ear for hooks. And Chvrches was also able to deliver the album live, performing a much-applauded set at this weekend’s Boston Calling festival.
“Every Open Eye” is not quite a masterpiece of an album, but it’s a very strong sophomore effort from a band that has already demonstrated itself to be a burgeoning synth-pop powerhouse. For all its brightness and palatability, Chvrches’ new offering demonstrates a remarkably insightful grasp on modern pop sensibilities—and that rock-solid understanding promises to propel the band to even greater heights.

Following the premiere of its much-maligned experimental documentary, “The Reflektor Tapes,” Arcade Fire is debuting five previously unreleased songs—two of which, “Get Right” and “Crucified Again,” will be released on 7-inch vinyl. In light of the band’s usually high standards, it’s not hard to see why both tracks were cut from the final record. As a double-sided single, however, the pairing of the two creates a surprisingly evocative musical marriage between Arcade Fire’s typically grandiose sound and the blues-infused feel that dominates the indie rock genre today. Neither track has the musical inventiveness or the slick commercial appeal to lead an album, but in their coupling, the listener hears something wonderfully, nostalgically old—and something new.
Within the context of modern indie rock, “Get Right” presents by far the more familiar picture. It is a bluesy, ballsy track, evocative in its distortion, liberal falsetto, and restrained, rolling bass of the early work of fellow Grammy winners The Black Keys. Even so, while hardly innovative, the song certainly is a new direction for the sonically sprawling Arcade Fire, and they execute it well—though they can’t help but lapse into a reaching, wandering synth melody in the song’s second half, taking the track from sexy slow jam to sci-fi movie soundtrack.
But for longtime listeners of Arcade Fire, it’s the vinyl’s B-side that will resonate most deeply. Replete with string arrangements, delicate vocals, and vaguely nonsensical lyrics (“On the twelfth of January / you don’t need what you can’t carry”), “Crucified Again” is lead singer Win Butler at 24, plucking gingerly at arpeggiated guitar chords for the tipsy crowd of a grimy Denver dive bar. It’s frontwoman Régine Chassagne at the keyboard ten years ago, singing in her native Quebeçois before a skeptical French audience at Rock en Seine. It’s the gentle, tender Arcade Fire we haven’t seen since “Une Année Sans Lumière” made its understated debut on 2004’s “Funeral.” And while it doesn’t stand tall enough to carry the weight of the original “Reflektor” on its fragile back, it’s the Arcade Fire we’ve sorely missed, and one we’d be wise to welcome back with open arms.

At a festival where two out of three headliners were coming off of the release of their second albums, the Avett Brothers were positively grandfatherly. Though the group only truly broke into the mainstream with the release of “I and Love and You” in 2009, Scott and Seth Avett put out their first EP as the Avett Brothers in 2000, when Alabama Shakes frontwoman Brittany Howard was only 12. Perhaps the band’s maturity partially explains why, during their first few songs on Friday evening, the crowd scarcely made any noise at all. Though City Hall Plaza appeared filled to capacity—as it generally is for Boston Calling’s last Friday slot, the longest and thus most important set of the festival—the audience seemed to have been lulled into placidity by Seth Avett’s gentle acoustic guitar and vocals on “Bring Your Love to Me,” the track with which the band began their set. That the crowd was so subdued is not a judgment on the Avett Brothers’ popularity but a testament to the power of the song—which sounded even more beautiful than its studio recording for all the slight imperfections of live performance—but it also illustrates a difficulty that the Avett Brothers must navigate in their performances. The group rises to equally great heights on their slow, romantic tracks as they do on those full of strumming, bluesy energy, and to unite the those two distinct modes into a coherent live performance is no mean feat.
This struggle was not without its casualties on Friday night: During “November Blue,” Scott Avett’s turn to perform acoustically and the band’s most exquisitely heartbreaking track, one could hear a buzz of conversation emanating from the audience. To fill an outdoor space with a single voice and a single guitar is challenging at the best of times, and this early in the set the crowd seemed restless, all too ready for hand clapping and foot stomping. Fortunately, at all other times the Avett Brothers managed to release the crowd’s energy with the learned skill of a decade of touring: Without missing a beat, they transitioned from “Bring Your Love to Me” into “Talk on Indolence,” a frenetic tongue twister of a song that had the crowd jumping up and down as a mass in time with the band’s own leaps about stage and threatening to collapse the VIP platform.
Throughout their performance, the Avett Brothers executed seamless transitions: Their set felt more like a continuous, hour-and-a-half-long exploration of their repertoire than a collection of distinct songs. Even those moments between tracks—most prominently a bold fiddle solo from their touring violinist, Tania Elizabeth—fitted solidly into their set and maintained the level of excitement they had established. As the night wore on, the band members seemed to feed off of one another’s energy, though most mere mortals would probably have been exhausted by jumping about as much as they did; cellist Joe Kwon in particular head banged his impressive mane with ever-increasing intensity. The band reached its performative height toward the end of its set with “Kick Drum Heart,” a track that could give a cramped basement bar the atmosphere of Lollapalooza. Toward the end of the song, Scott helped Seth down off of stage and then followed his brother into the photography pit, to the screams of the fans at the front of the audience, and the pair finished performing the song there—only to move into a hard rock, electric guitar-heavy interlude when they returned onstage. It was at that point obvious that the Avett Brothers had managed to win over a relatively difficult crowd by the sheer force of their energy.

Weaving through the various exhibitions at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, Jane Pickering makes a brief detour toward the newly installed hive frame—a temporary exhibit created in collaboration with the Harvard Undergraduate Beekeepers—to check on the bees. Apparently, the queen had not laid any eggs recently, scaring personnel in the museum. For Pickering, the bees’ well-being is one of many responsibilities that come with her job. The others extend farther, across a multitude of exhibits and past museum boundaries themselves.
Pickering is the first executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. Established in 2012, the consortium acts as an umbrella organization for six Harvard museums operated under the Faculty of Arts and Sciences: the Harvard Museum of Natural History (which unifies the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard University Herbaria, and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum), the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, and the Harvard Semitic Museum. Assisting the associated museums with programming and outreach, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture seeks to streamline public relations. “[FAS] formed this alliance because there are certain things that we wanted to do together, but also to more efficiently coordinate the outward facing part—the parts involved with the communities—of the museums,” says Peter L. Galison, faculty director at the Collection for Historical Scientific Instruments.
At the same time that the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture clarifies the divide between public relations and private operations of the museums, it assists in blurring the lines between different disciplines at Harvard. The formation of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture ushers in a new era for six museums that have existed for the most part independently for years. As the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture continues to launch its programs, it presents a case study of the unique and collaborative interdisciplinary culture at Harvard.
The museums included in the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture are diverse not only in discipline but also in scope. Each museum houses a considerably large collection in a different field, from Near Eastern archaeology, history, and culture in the Semitic Museum to minerals and zoological artifacts in the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Yet, while the museums are externally different, they all share a common goal: a commitment to educating Harvard affiliates.
“Today, we still see the [Semitic Museum] as a center to teach about culture and to house the teaching collection,” says Peter Der Manuelian, director of the Harvard Semitic Museum. As an organization under the FAS and led by faculty members within Harvard, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture devotes considerable time to maintaining its collections for academic purposes.
“What we do with the collection is really [provide] a place for research and teaching,” says Jean-Francois Gauvin, director of administration for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. “We’re open for the public, but we’re not meant to have 100,000 visitors a year. Our main audience is the Harvard community.”
Such sentiments present a dilemma for the museums, however. While the staffs of the individual museums care about academia, they also have public exhibitions to maintain. In this sense, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture functions to allow the museums to balance their public and private faces. “HMSC has been working hard with us to help reach that [public] audience and make collections...better known to the Harvard community,” says Jeffrey Quilter, director of the Peabody Museum. “Now that we no longer have [to administer] the education program and public events...[we can focus on] taking good care of our collections and working to get those collections viewed by Harvard students and faculty.”
Sara Schechner, staff curator for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments, says that, for the collection, curatorial operations have not changed; what is different is its publicity and the new coordination among the members in the consortium concerning programs and event dates. In that way, within each museum’s inner framework, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture does little except to streamline the marketing and outreach process. The effects of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, however, are far from limited.
Donald H. Pfister, curator of the Farlow Library and Herbarium of Cryptogamic Botany, sits in the Earth and Planetary Sciences gallery of the Harvard Museum of Natural History, a large space filled with a collection of rocks and minerals. Situated on the third floor of the building, the room, like all others on the floor, allows access to the Peabody. But as Pfister reflects on the relationship between the museums in the past, he notes the imperfections of the museums’ relationships before the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. “There were never physical barriers. This floor pretty much had always been interconnected,” he says. “There was a sense of subtle intellectual barriers that are probably still there to some extent, but the idea is now we’re looking across the museums to make the experience and the possibilities greater.”
While collaboration is not a novel concept for museums—for instance, Schechner says that the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments always borrows from other collections for their exhibitions—the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture allows for different forms of cooperation. The consortium specifically plans to curate some exhibitions within each museum and to pull from the expertise of other Harvard professors. This plan has already manifested in “Finding Our Way: An Exploration of Human Navigation” in the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Curated by physics professor John Huth, the exhibit was planned by staff at the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture from beginning to end. “HMSC helps to operationalize things like exhibits and public programs, but what they like to call content knowledge has to come from us and from faculty,” Quilter says. “We help the HMSC identify what faculty members to contribute to the public programs in the exhibits and provide that kind of expertise ourselves.”
Pickering says that, practically, such collaboration is useful; for instance, publicity is easier if there are more partners involved working to get the word out. “More philosophically, the world is a complicated place and the challenges involve some interdisciplinary work,” she says, adding that measures like the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture allow for such integrative studies to occur.
Through such efforts, a thriving community flourishes among the museums. “[The collaboration] never was organic in the way that it is now,” Pfister says. “I think that everybody is thinking about the museum as a whole, less so...as units within FAS.”
A brief walk away from the Harvard Museum of Natural History rests the Harvard Art Museums. Comprised of the Fogg Museum, Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum, the recently renovated building unites the once-physically separate museums under one roof—a move similar to how the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture publicly connects its six museums. This character of collaboration is consistent throughout the Harvard Art Museums’ programming, both within the art museums themselves and across the campus. “We see our role at the Art Museums as, first and foremost, showcasing and exploring our own collections,” says David R. Odo, the museums’ director of student programs and research curator of university collections initiatives. “But we really want to have a broad conversation across the history, meaning, and role of art.”
For Odo, such conversations can occur by means of Harvard’s rich, interdisciplinary collections. Already the Harvard Art Museums has a University Collections gallery, a room to exhibit artifacts from other museums at Harvard; the current display is an installation of African art. Additionally, the Harvard Art Museums has various programming planned in collaboration with other museums, such as the ongoing “What’s Light Got to Do With It?” lecture series which draws on expertise and work from the Harvard Art Museums, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, and the Harvard Brain Science Initiative. “We’re just very interested in creating a dialogue between our art collections and other collections on campus,” Odo says.
One such dialogue is currently in the works between Ethan W. Lasser, curator and newly named head of the division of European and American Art, and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments. Lasser is curating an exhibit on the Philosophy Chamber, a historical collection that includes scientific instruments and other extraordinary materials. Set to open in 2017, the exhibit seeks to reassemble the portraits, prints, books, and non-Western artifacts in Harvard Hall from mid-18th to the beginning of the 19th century. According to Gauvin, the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments has loaned various instruments, including an 18th-century orrery designed by Joseph Pope, for Lasser’s exhibit. Gauvin adds that this give and take is mutual: the Art Museums will be providing the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments with a portrait of John Winthrop by John Singleton Copley that features Winthrop’s observation of the transit of Venus.
According to Lasser, this combination of art and artifacts from different collections allows the museums to tell a fuller story. “Both HMSC and the Art Museums are really enthusiastic about doing collaborative programming because we all believe in [pairing] objects in our collections to affect people’s ways of thinking,” Pickering says.
As the curators and directors mention, these affected ways of thinking range from a novel way of observing an object or image to a consideration of the intersection between art and science. Gauvin notes that many of the older scientific instruments, constructed out of rich materials like glass and bronze, are actually quite beautiful—echoing sentiments made by Jim Hankin, director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, about the scientific sketches of organisms, such as Jacques Burkhardt’s watercolors of fish. “People often think about arts and sciences as being very distinct disciplines, but I think that’s a misunderstanding, that there are a lot of commonalities between art and science,” Hankin says. “By doing collaborative activities, we’re helping to restore a more realistic picture between the two areas.”
Last spring, graduate and undergraduate students and scholars convened on Harvard’s campus for the Harvard Curatorial Innovations Series. Organized by both the Harvard Art Museums and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, the series was comprised of a lecture and two days of in-depth conversations with internationally renowned curators. The curators for last spring were Leah A. Dickerman ’86 from the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Thomas C. Rockwell from the Exploratorium in San Francisco. According to Galison, the conversation dealt with curating new kinds of shows as well as the relationship between exhibiting the arts and exhibiting the sciences. While the previous year’s series had featured only Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, curator of contemporary art exhibit dOCUMENTA (13), iterations to come plan to bring in two curators from different fields. “Our new model is to have someone from the art world and someone from the science museum world,” Galison says. “They have much to teach each other. It’s a really interesting combination.”
The curatorial innovation series reflects not only the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture and the Harvard Art Museums’ joint commitment to educating through the combination of disciplines but also to the similarities between the museums’ operations. For instance, Gauvin says that the Strauss Center for Conservation and Technical Studies has been helpful in allowing his staff to understand and categorize their collection; in particular, he cites the use of X-ray analysis for metals and carbon-dating. This focus resembles that of the Harvard Art Museums on using the Strauss Center to preserve and study their own objects.
In not only programming and interests but also in curation, the differences between the Harvard Art Museums and the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture have become more minute. “At the end of the day, we’re doing the same thing: [We’re] trying to understand these materials objects and display them in space,” Lasser says. “We speak a similar language even as our specialities are very different.”
Three years after its formation, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture has found direction in its pursuits. While on paper it coordinates the public activities and the face of its affiliated museums, in practice the consortium strives to eradicate the fragile boundaries between Harvard’s museums. In a community where sharing collections was already a norm, the creation of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture has only added to a legacy of collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking. It is a legacy reflected by the physical merger of the Harvard Art Museums, by the combination of collections across three museums in the Harvard Museum of Natural History, and even by Harvard’s commitment to a liberal arts education. “There’s a real push these days at Harvard to integrate activities across disciplines, and that applies to the museums as well,” Hankin says.
Schechner agrees. “The move on campus is to encourage students to look more closely at material culture, to mingle things from different collections, and to realize the value of them is not simply restricted to their discipline,” she says.
To that end, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture and its affiliates seek to approach museums and their supposed genres in different ways by emphasizing the importance of museums in merging disciplines. “The museums have such a huge potential role to play in the Harvard community and sometimes that role can be overlooked,” Manuelian says. “We’re hoping to raise that profile…[to] get more access and improve the undergraduate experience, the graduate students’ experience, and the visitor’s experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During the last scene of “Pawn Sacrifice,” the stoic Soviet chess icon Boris Spassky (Liev Schreiber) and the paranoid, prodigious Brooklynite Bobby Fischer (Tobey Maguire) lock eyes. They are in the midst of their two month-long faceoff at the 1972 World Chess Championships, and Fischer has visibly lost his cool—trembling, grimacing, and looking generally deranged as he tries to plot his next move. Suddenly, Schreiber whispers one of his only English sentences of the film: “You don’t look well, Robert James.” His delivery is opaque—is he taunting Fischer into a panicked move? How closely does he pay attention to Fischer’s tumultuous personal life if he knows his middle name? Schreiber smiles coyly, but his voice, deep and reedy with a thick Russian accent, emanates concern. The raw ambiguity of Schreiber’s interaction with Fischer is indicative of what director Edward Zwick and his cast manage to pull off: an emotionally truthful Cold War drama that focuses on deep performances and effective set-pieces rather than a clear delineation of good and evil.
Tobey Maguire’s performance as Bobby Fischer is astonishing, worthy of accolades come award season. Maguire goes small—seldom does his Fischer explode or seem dangerous, but the undercurrent of his intense paranoia is always present, in the form of a tic, a vocal tremble, or a dart of the eye. He captures Fischer’s contradictions: He’s simultaneously suave and stuttering, egomaniacal and convinced he’s about to be revealed as a fraud. In a particularly gorgeous moment shortly before the 1972 Championship, Maguire crouches in the deserted apartment of his youth, on the edge of weeping with his sister as he relays his litany of fears about Soviet spying, Jewish control of the political system, and his own survival. Even while he delivers an invective dripping in bigotry and irrationality, there’s still softness in Maguire’s voice; his Fischer never loses his humanity, even as he loses his mind.
For the most part, the film’s veteran screenwriting triumvirate of Steven Knight, Steven Rivele, and Christopher Wilkinson creates a realistic long durée trajectory for Fischer. The story starts with his emotional tumult in the days leading up to the World Championship, zooms back to his youth, and builds up tension as it moves through the tumultuous 1960s. The filmmakers choose to focus on particular pressure points—Fischer’s first American meeting with Spassky in Los Angeles gets more screen time than the next five, very eventful years. Most of these loci may have been chosen because of the inherent richness of their images: Schreiber listening to the Rolling Stones and dipping into the Santa Monica surf, with his suited, sunglass-wearing, expressionless entourage behind him is a fantastic East meets West moment. Conversely, Maguire looks dwarfed by the Soviet system as he angrily descends the steps of a massive Soviet hall, convinced his adversaries are cheating.
While most of the settings embrace the surreal grandiosity of Fischer’s battle with the U.S.S.R.’s chess machine, others come off as mere conveniences or necessary breaks from the more compelling geopolitical intrigue. During the Los Angeles vignette, Fischer loses his virginity at his hotel to a streetwise prostitute (Évelyne Brochu). The two don’t seem markedly affected by the meeting, and Fischer never appears with a romantic counter again. Yet we occasionally cut back to the hotel, where Brochu proudly watches her one-time fling dominate the competition on TV. Maybe the writers are trying to suggest that Fischer never had any significant romantic relationship or are simply attempting to throw some sort of sexual intrigue into the otherwise sterile social scape of Fischer’s life. Whatever the case, the inclusion feels more lurid than emotionally significant.
Other skips in logic and time also feel forced. One of the earliest chronological scenes shows little Bobby anxiously scanning the streets for FBI surveillance during one his mother’s radical leftist parties. While the young Fischer (Aiden Lovekamp) is believable and the scene gives Fischer’s mother (Robin Weigart) some necessary screen time, the whole exercise feels awfully familiar. The film may have been more effective had it dispensed altogether with the origin stories and allowed adult Fischer to be taken at face value, warts and all. The reliance on literality also seeps through with some of the expository material about the 1960s—there’s a lot of montage, news reports, and Forrest Gump-ian insertions of Ficher into famous interviews that feel archaic.
The performances, then, are the film’s ultimate saviors. Schreiber is perhaps even better than Maguire because he makes so much out of so little—his Spassky smirks, grumbles, and occasionally loses his cool with a consistency and charisma that is unforgettable. Peter Sarsgaard is predictably lovable as Father Paul Lombardy, a chess savant priest who advises Fischer, while Michael Stuhlbarg is hilarious as Paul Marshall, Fischer’s blowhard manager. Zwick would have pulled off a miracle had there been no clunky elements to a story as morally and historically ambiguous as Fischer’s. At the very least, his ability to bring out fantastic renderings and just enough imagistic clout makes “Pawn Sacrifice” a fascinating period piece.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Calling kicked off this past Friday with a half-day lineup, featuring Gregory Alan Isakov, Icelandic indie-rock outfit Of Monsters and Men, and genre-bending folk-rock group The Avett Brothers. The crowd started off slightly sparse and sedate, and only warmed marginally as the night wore on. Festivalgoers were still streaming in during festival opener Gregory Alan Isakov’s performance, and the South-African singer’s melodic, crooned folk-rock offerings provided a pleasant introduction to the evening.
Icelandic band Of Monsters and Men followed Isakov’s set, and despite their fairly large following, were unable to fully leverage their popularity to rouse the crowd—the festival’s atmosphere remained somewhat sluggish, with few concertgoers outside the first few rows responding strongly to the performance.
The Avett Brothers—the evening’s headliners—came on next, and the North Carolina-based group played many of their hits, though they notably omitted their biggest, “I and Love and You.” Though the crowd started off slightly unresponsive, it did defrost a bit as The Avett Brothers’ performance continued. The crowd never did quite lose all of its stiffness, but The Avett Brothers’ energetic and vibrant set still provided a satisfying close to the first day of the festival.
Check back for updates later in the week from the last two days of the festival.

A thrilling exploration of desperation, family, and the female experience, “Crystal’s” excels based on the strength of the crackling tension among its characters. The play, which runs Sept. 25 to Oct. 3 in the Loeb Experimental Theater, features an superb original script by director Aislinn E. Brophy ’17.
“Crystal’s” borrows its title from the strip club in which it is set, but the play is not fundamentally about the club: The voyeurs and even the eponymous owner never appear and remain non-presences. Rather, the club is the crucible in which Brophy’s characters interact. The play follows four strippers, Angel (Liz P. Kantor ’18), Candy (Eliza B. Mantz ’18), Cynthia (Emily E. Bergquist ’18) and Marjorie (Julia E. Belanoff ’18); Candy’s son Johnny (Colin A. Mark ’17); and the club’s new manager, Al (Sam A. Hagen ’18). The characters, particularly the strippers, are refreshingly complex. Functioning as fully human characters, these women contradict prevailing stereotypes of strippers and resist easy categorization as tropes or deconstructions. Each line of Brophy’s script is effective; as the plot advances, the characters never stop developing. Under the pressures of mental illness, broken families, and poverty, they continue to twist and darken.
Al, the new manager, is the catalyst for the play’s action. More than any other character, Al serves to further the social commentary in Brophy’s script, but the subtlety of Hagen’s performance makes the character compelling regardless. Over the course of the play, Hagen artfully reveals the sinister underpinnings of Al’s nice-guy persona. Despite his initial awkwardness, Al quickly learns to take advantage of the inherent male manager-female stripper power dynamic, although not always with great success—in one remarkable scene, Angel overrides him with the sheer force of her personality.
The irascible Angel provides much of the play’s comic relief, due to the unflinching unpleasantness of Kantor’s portrayal. While out-loud laughs are rare, the play is darkly funny from start to finish. Calling attention to the tragic absurdities of sexism and poverty, “Crystal’s” invites the audience to bitterly chuckle with, not at, its characters, as they cope with the play’s weighty themes. This sort of bleak, cynical humor comes through the strongest in the character of Candy, the flighty, deeply troubled mother of Johnny. As Candy, Mantz performs admirably, somehow highlighting genuinely funny moments even in her character’s desperate circumstances. She dominates the stage as the conflicts between the characters converge into a seat-gripping climax—paradoxically, the funniest scene in the show.
The script’s strengths are complemented well by Brophy’s staging, which smartly reinforces the intersections and oppositions among characters that drive the show. The audience sits around an elevated “X,” which connects four squares that feature dancing apparatus. Although most of the action takes place near the center of the “X,” the strippers often retreat to their respective corners, where they belittle, interrogate, and console one another from across the stage. In addition to playing Candy, Mantz also designed lighting for “Crystal’s,” and her choices augment the sense of tension and discomfort.
Despite these successes, the play encounters difficulties at its conclusion. Due to the atmosphere created by the script, actors, and lighting, its tension builds to a nerve-wracking breaking point, but the resolution ultimately disappoints. Although the poetic final scene clearly intends to weave the play’s various strands together, it fails to do so in a thematically consistent way, rendering its meaning somewhat indecipherable.
Nevertheless, the play in its entirety is effective. Especially when the strippers dance—the same routine, increasingly mechanically, over and over—one can’t help but feel somewhat like a patron of the club, complicit in the objectification. That feeling is a great achievement, signifying that “Crystal’s” successfully links the extremes of the strip club’s power dynamics with the realities women confront daily. The play raises heavy questions: What is it to be a “nice guy?” Why are we so quick to call girls “stupid?” Why, as Al observes, does nobody care what happens in the near-lawlessness of the club? Brophy and the cast animate these questions with genuine humanity; as Brophy notes in her director’s statement, “When we are reminded of the humanity of women, the oppression that the female half of the world’s population faces seems senseless. And that is just what it is.”

Taking the stage at City Hall Plaza for its second performance at Boston Calling since the festival’s beginning in spring 2013, Of Monsters and Men opened its set on Friday night just after the sun had set. As the band began playing their new standard opener, “Thousand Eyes,” co-lead singer Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir alternated between serenading the dark crowd with her melancholy vocals and striking the floor tom-tom drum next to her. Hilmarsdóttir, along with other lead singer Ragnar "Raggi" Þórhallsson, stood at the front of the stage, almost blending in with the dim stage lighting that complimented the song’s brooding mood. They, as well as the rest of the band, were all dressed in black—perhaps an overt reflection of the darker, more introspective material of their new album, “Beneath the Skin.”
The band’s impressive nine touring members were scattered across the stage, playing a veritable symphony of instruments ranging from the trumpet to the accordion, with four guitarists sometimes playing at once. Although the crowd maintained a relatively low energy for the majority of the performance, several attendees near the front of the stage couldn’t help but jump and sing along to most of the band’s songs. During performances of particularly popular singles such as “King and Lionheart” and “Mountain Sound”—which actually happened at the very beginning of the set—the crowd seemed to surge together with additional energy.
The audience appeared less receptive to some of the band’s newer songs, with slower ballads from their release this past July such as “I of the Storm” failing to rally as much engagement. Nevertheless, Of Monsters and Men closed its performance with a strong trio of songs from its first album: “Lakehouse,” “Little Talks,” and “Six Weeks.” Partway through the first of these songs, during the bridge, drummer Arnar Rósenkranz Hilmarsson stood up and hit his drum sticks together, encouraging the audience to clap along. The band built on this momentum throughout the next two songs, closing on a strong instrumental solo punctuated by a flashing, colorful light show.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During my sophomore year of high school in Portland, Ore., a strange phenomenon took place. Jeans grew tighter, glasses thicker, t-shirts more ironic. Mason jars became the beverage containers de rigueur, and girls and boys alike eschewed shiny blond tresses for unisex haircuts that exuded a deliberately rakish air. “They’re called hipsters,” my sister explained to me. I shrugged, expecting the trend to fizzle out like the rare Oregon sunshine. Instead, it only spread. Those unsavvy to the ways of the thrift store went to Urban Outfitters and bought “vintage” and “distressed” clothing for hundreds of dollars, aspiring to the tastefully retro hipster aesthetic. The entire endeavor was steeped in irony: The intense effort involved in looking effortless, the renunciation of mainstream consumerism (in favor of another, more trendy type of consumerism) and the refusal, at all costs, to admit to being a hipster caused me to view the entire culture as a sort of enigma.
From an anthropological perspective, hipster culture is interesting, not only because of its idiosyncrasies but also because of its utility in the quest to understand how so-called “alternative” cultures define themselves in relation to the mainstream. This is an especially complicated question, since very few hipsters will admit to being members of the movement. I call this the hipster paradox: While the hipster culture defines itself as alternative, this definition rests upon the flimsy principle of being the “anti-mainstream.” Ultimately, this means that the definition of hipster is still dependent upon the mainstream that hipster culture seeks to supersede. Classifying hipsters into a distinct social group becomes especially complicated when one considers the fact that hipster culture is now seen as a subset of the mainstream instead of its antithesis. Gone are the days when thick glasses and year-round flannels were seen as edgy. These trends have been adopted by major retailers such as Forever 21, Nordstrom, and even JCPenney, all seeking to capitalize on the hipster aesthetic. In a Guardian article on this very topic, trend forecaster Chris Sanderson says that the “idea of the hipster has been swallowed by the mainstream.” He elaborates: "The hipster died the minute we called him a hipster. The word no longer had the same meaning."
The so-called division between mainstream and “hipster” becomes even more troubling when one considers the hipster trope of “before it was cool.” As in “I used to drink cold brewed coffee before it was cool” or “I listened to X band before they were cool.” This implies that one major aspect of hipster culture is adopting trends before they enter the mainstream; however, to simply say that hipster culture is “pre-mainstream” is to ignore many of the questions that make this specific culture so interesting. Why, for example, are old things seen as better and more authentic? What is the definition of authenticity? Why will no one claim the term hipster? Why is it that certain cities become centers of hipster culture while others do not? Is it possible to find an aesthetic philosophy, mainstream or otherwise, that exists beyond consumerism? And why will no one admit that the “effortless” aesthetic is actually the most effort-intensive?
Analyzing the contradictions of hipster culture is much deeper than figuring out why vinyl records have experienced such a resurgence. In a world where “culture” was the 2014 Merriam Webster most searched word of the year, the social divisions that we inherit and create are especially relevant. Because of increasing globalization and the the growth of corporations, more people can listen to the same songs and wear the same clothes. As our culture becomes more uniform, we are forced to search for new sources of distinction. By using hipster culture as a case study for the process of distinguishing oneself from the mainstream, we can better define the changing place of culture and individuality in our modern world.

During a question and answer session headlined by writers Stephen King and Lee Child at Sanders Theatre recently, King made a few casual—albeit illuminating—comments about his writing process. Asked by an audience member how he knows whether the plot of a story should be linear or nonlinear, King responded that he lets his stories determine how they want to be told. “The story asks you to tell it in a certain way,” he said. “We are stenographers. The story is being told to us and we write it down.” What did Stephen King, one of the world’s most preeminent writers, mean by this? Was he insinuating that his stories write themselves, and that all he does is wield the pen? Not exactly. King was accentuating the pertinence of a writer’s subservience to the writing and stressing that the process of writing must be organic in order for the end product to be unique, engaging, and enduring.
In fact, King was reiterating a strategy long professed by other revered writers, including Christopher Scanlan and Peter Elbow. In his article “Do the Writing Only You Can Do,” Scanlan corroborates King’s point, arguing that “writers need to let the story speak if they are going to produce stories that break barriers for themselves and their readers.” According to Scanlan, writing speaks and the writer must listen. Likewise, in his book “Writing Without Teachers,” Elbow explains, “You are trying to let the words, thoughts, feelings, and perceptions try to find some of their own order, logic, coherence. You’re trying to get your material to do some of the steering instead of doing it all yourself.” Like King and Scanlan, Elbow emphasizes the importance of the morphability of good writing. Elbow goes on to describe the “chaos and disorientation” that is an integral part of producing exceptional written work. He elaborates upon what he calls “cooking,” the process of “getting words to interact,” and “growing,“ which he defines as “getting words to evolve through stages.” The writer’s ultimate goal, Elbow posits, is to let his work naturally find “a center of gravity.”
How does the writer go about peeling off layers of inessential material in order to get to the pith of the writing? Obviously, no writer can churn out a masterpiece with few or no edits. Some of the most gifted writers in the world spend years fine-tuning their work. A piece of writing can remain intransigently inchoate, no matter how much effort the writer puts into it; consequently, the norm is to write, rewrite, then edit until the crux of the piece surfaces and crystallizes. In essence, King, Elbow, and Scanlan suggest that writers should embrace this process rather than be daunted by it. After all, as world renowned writing instructor Robert McKee states in his book “Story,” “Story is about thoroughness, not shortcuts.” Such “thoroughness” mandates patience and, more importantly, humility, which seems to have been King’s primary point.
The writer’s humility can manifest itself in the questions he or she asks while struggling through the “chaos and disorientation” described by Elbow. The writer must ascertain how he or she can be of service to the writing. Is there an idea in one paragraph that is itching to marry similar ideas in another paragraph? Could an opening paragraph make a memorable conclusion instead? Are there aspects of the story that the writer thinks are pure gold, but that are actually extraneous and must therefore be expunged—as mandated by the boss, the work being written? In other words, are there any darlings that the writer must kill in order for the rough stone to metamorphose into a diamond? Finally, does the story flow seamlessly—as if it was destined to be that way?
During the Q&A with Lee Child, King seemed to present a paradox. The writer must allow the writing to develop a life of its own, with as little intrusion as possible; yet, the process of writing is inherently meddlesome, involving rewriting, cutting, pasting, deleting, etc. tantamount to searching for a needle in a haystack. King’s ultimate message seems to be that the writer must pay attention to what the writing is saying and get out of the way so that the essence of the piece can reveal itself.

I believe there is an important social role for final clubs at Harvard. Rather than seeking their demise, wouldn't it make more sense to commit to expanding their traditional contribution to Harvard by working to integrate them more fully into the responsible fabric of undergraduate life?
I don’t believe distancing Harvard from these organizations would be a good way to address alcohol abuse or diminish the occurrence of sexual assault on campus. If the administration worked closely with these clubs, the offending behaviors could be addressed to achieve better outcomes for campus social life.
Let's also acknowledge there is a strong demand for single-sex organizations on campus. Witness the growth of female final clubs from zero in 1990 to five today. Witness also the growth of sororities from zero to four on campus over the past two decades. Not to be outdone, given the limited capacity of the all male final clubs, witness the growth of fraternities from zero to five in the same time period. With Harvard’s help on real estate, the all-female organizations could catch up with all the male organizations.
It is more fitting for Harvard to lead the way in a national college discussion to develop responsible young adults wherever students of college age chose to belong to single-sex organizations. Opting out of this "discussion" does not seem Harvard-worthy when considering approximately 750,000 undergraduates across the nation and Canada belong to a Greek organization and their supportive alumni extend beyond nine million. This issue has heft, and Harvard's response matters.
The very idea that final clubs threaten the goal of Harvard being an inclusive place that welcomes people with different backgrounds is overstated. Harvard is hardly an inclusive institution, rejecting almost 19 of 20 applicants. All of the varsity sports teams regularly cut athletes. There are tryouts for the band, orchestra, and choir—and these groups only select the best musicians. There are many oversubscribed classes at Harvard where one must apply to get in. Acceptance into a final club is no different; punches compete on their social merits. It’s a myth that you are free to do whatever you dream about doing at Harvard. You must have the talent, work hard, and be lucky to achieve your dreams. In short, Harvard is a very exclusive place.
In addition to the final clubs, Harvard has many exclusive groups based on gender, race, and creed. There is the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (I was a member), the Black Students Association to name a few. The Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Catholic, Protestant, Hindu students all have their affinity groups. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender students have a group. Admittedly, these groups are theoretically open to all students, but their missions are so selective, that they are in fact very exclusive groups.
The administration maintains that House life should be sufficient social life for its students. But while that is a good starting point, Harvard should be all about providing many options to students. I enjoyed being part of the Chinese Students Association, the ski team, the Fly Club, and Kirkland House. I am glad that Harvard provided all of these outlets for me.
The male final clubs have their roots in the 1800s and acquired their real estate long ago. This gives them a competitive advantage. The female clubs are playing catch-up now that Harvard has more even gender ratios. Harvard could help the female clubs by providing them spaces.
Harvard should bring the final clubs into the fold and assist them in preventing sexual assault and alcohol abuse. Harvard has extensive policies and prevention programs for its Houses which can be extended to the final clubs. I believe HUPD is far more qualified to police and enforce such policies than the Cambridge Police. Harvard has a lot at stake to protect it students given the Clery Act and recent developments in the interpretation of Title IX. Harvard can show its leadership in campus safety among U.S. colleges with its potentially progressive stance with final clubs.
Harvard should recognize the role of final clubs as it does recognize the role of other single-gender, single-race, single-religious, single-sexual orientation groups that exist on campus. Excluding final clubs is not the way to have an inclusive or safe community.

Mitchell Dong ’75 is managing director at Pythagoras Investment Management. He was a member of the Fly Club.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If I should die, I want my death to be as glorious as life. I want to be swung up in flung fate on the brink of a car crash, shifted in the blank air like broken glass. I want to be the oldest person on earth. I want the knife pointed at my throat. I want to protect something devastatingly right. I want it all: elegies, rhapsodies, tears, news clippings, and those wicked laughs in the backroom. I want my body folded wrong; I want destruction for construction. I want to die from Pop Rocks and Coke. I want to die next to someone I’m desperately in love with. I want to have known that person for three days. I want to have known that person for 70 years. I want to do it like Svidrigailov. I want to grow old. I want to dream up heaven, and I want it to look so much like a Greek mansion that even Athena hides in the kitchen. I want to encompass death, to wear it on my sleeve or keep it under my skin, because, well, if you can’t find something to live for, you sure should find something to die for. 
That paragraph was blunt. I wrote it with abnormal, un-conversational conviction. I wrote it to both glorify and qualify, to make death as close as breath. I wrote it in a world where the dead do not die but pass away, kick the bucket, depart this life, meet their maker. Where death is often viewed as dark. Where death in the media takes form in ghosts, zombies, and other members of the supernatural more often than not. Where death seems unnatural and deviant, something too far to touch.
But there is no other controversy like death, like Michael Brown’s blood oozing onto the streets of Ferguson, like Trayvon Martin’s and Walter Scott’s and Brendon Tevlin’s and so many others. There is no other market like death, like medicines meant to expand lifespan, like the fountain of youth, like the funeral industry. Americans hate death. Americans love death. While some accuse Americans of erasing and denying it, others accuse them of glorifying it. While some view suicide, especially that of young people, as a catalyst to reevaluate cultural kindness and societal values, others accuse those who do commit suicide, even Vincent Van Gogh or Virginia Woolf or Robin Williams, for not thinking long enough to find a reason to live. We deal with death by “forgetting it.” We deal with death, even with national tragedies, by “getting over it.” Or we don’t deal with death. We love to live. In too many ways in American society, death, unlike life, isn’t individually practical, isn’t profitable, doesn’t have potential to get a college education or raise a family, doesn’t have any potential, period.
But death is real. Some psychologists claim that conversations about mortality will become increasingly important over the next decades, as America’s largest generation, the baby-boomers, die off in unprecedented numbers. As Dr. Lawrence R. Samuels wrote in an article in Psychology Today, “I…conclude that the emerging ‘death-centric’ society will be a period of considerable turmoil, perhaps equivalent to that of the countercultural 1960s and 1970s.” Though I don’t think about death in such overarching, dramatic social terms, I understand that if understanding death is not sociologically important, it is personally, even if not politically, essential.
We should think about death as brilliantly and deeply as we think about life. We should think about how we want to die as much as how we want to live. Because the world is made up of counterparts and opposites, yin-and-yang and complementary colors. My high school English teacher believed that Javert could not exist without Jean Valjean, that Razskolnikov did not have meaning without Svidrigailov. The cliché states that you can’t know happiness if you don’t know sadness, that there is no male without a female. Understanding both, a topic and its opposite, deepens the meaning of both. So it is strange to believe that we can live life meaningfully without thinking of the nature of death incessantly; it is strange to think we can live if there is nothing to die for, or that we can live long enough to forget the impact of death and grief, that we can chase death away further by taking the right, precautionary steps to live.
Question death because it holds life. Glorify it. Grieve it. Love it. Hold it. Hate it. Want it. Watch it. Because there are so many truths in these statements, so much bubbling under the surface. So much to know about those who want to grow old, who want to fade to nothingness, who want to love an idea or a person so much it becomes fatal, who want to die young. Because those who question want to know what’s important and want to believe in why. They don’t want to live; they want to survive. To live while they die. To die while they live. They don’t want to die; they want to begin. So come. Question. And watch it all unfold before you.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of all the surprising participants who have entered the presidential race this summer, Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig is perhaps the most unexpected. In early September, Lessig—who originally taught international law at the University of Chicago before focusing his attentions on cyberlaw and, later, campaign finance—announced his candidacy for the highest office in the land. His platform is simple: pass comprehensive campaign finance reform and then immediately resign. Lessig's activist campaign might seem fanciful, but it has nevertheless accurately demonstrated the absurdity of our political system.
The core message of Lessig’s campaign—that politics in America today is broken and in desperate need of reform—cannot be ignored. As we have opined in the past, campaign finance should not be the province of the wealthy and well-connected. Lessig is right that the power of money in politics impedes our ability to advance solutions to a myriad of national problems; moreover, the ability of a few to spend heavily in campaign donations skews our system away from its democratic principles. On issues ranging from gun control to climate change, from tax reform to healthcare, from energy policy to infrastructure, major campaign donations from companies and other wealthy benefactors distort the issues at play and unnecessarily preclude otherwise sensible policy fixes.
This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the issue of money in politics runs at a deeper level than most public policy issues. Through its pervasiveness, it affects the very way in which our democracy operates. There is a reason few candidates from either party (except perhaps Donald Trump, ironically) appear interested in speaking out about their campaigns’ funding: Even having a chance at the Oval Office—and at solving this issue from that perch—requires a significant amount of money, and the backing of some rich donors. Into this breach steps Lessig, an outsider with no reasonable shot, nothing to lose, and a campaign with a vague flavor of absurdism.
Despite his long odds, it is commendable that Lessig has taken this opportunity to draw wider attention to the flaws of our political system. If he manages to gain the one percent of national support required to enter the first Democratic debate, Lessig could entirely upend the dynamic of the conversation. The contrast between Lessig and his opponents—a former secretary of state, a sitting senator, a former governor, and a former senator—has the potential to be revealing. It would be particularly interesting to hear Hillary Clinton, the establishment candidate with a giant war chest and strong Wall Street ties, challenged to explain her plans for campaign finance reform.
Even if he cannot or does not get within sight of the White House—or for that matter, the Democratic nomination—Lessig’s entry into the presidential race has already helped to bring attention to the issue of campaign finance. Further, it has helped build pressure on the other Democratic candidates to take firmer stances. We applaud Lessig’s candidacy and his attempts to encourage debate on how to make politics a more equitable playing field, a discussion that we can all hope will lead to action.

With contract negotiations between Harvard and its largest union set to run past the Sept. 30 deadline, the parties have collectively brought in a small team of experienced mediators to aid in the ongoing talks.
Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard economics professor, and Robert B. McKersie, professor emeritus at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, both served as mediators in the lengthy Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers contract renegotiations of 2013. They have returned to aid in the current negotiations. 
“Once we start really getting into the issues and not being on the same page, that’s when the mediators are most helpful,” said Carrie E. Barbash, a HUCTW organizer.
A main function of the mediators, Barbash and HUCTW director Bill Jaeger said, is to prevent procedural debates—disputes over the agenda, order, and formal rules of the negotiations—from overshadowing their policy contents.
“It can be very helpful as the process gets more intense to have someone to turn to to get those quick simple answers,” Jaeger said.
The mediators, who participated in the informal policy brainstorming sessions HUCTW and University representatives held with Harvard faculty experts last spring, will also be on hand to aid both sides in coming to consensus on issues like health care and salaries, which have been contentious in the past.
“We both sometimes get weighed down in past baggage that is not as productive,” Barbash said. “The mediators can help us with which parts of the baggage are important, and which parts are just baggage.”
Health care remains one of the most prominent and contentious issues of the ongoing talks, especially as the protracted negotiations have likely pushed any changes to health care plans into the enrollment period for 2017, according to Barbash.
“These health care issues are heavily politicized by events of the last year,” said Jaeger. “There are some differences of perspective about managing the cost of the health care and there are some strong feelings about that, so [there is] definitely a feeling at this point that it’s not going to be easy to work all of that out and settle on one strategy, one design, one set of policies in the healthcare area that works for HUCTW and is agreeable to the University.”
In an email to HUCTW’s more than 4,600 constituents, union leaders wrote that the University’s proposed health care plan for union members mirrors the controversial one Harvard proposed for non-union faculty and staff for 2015, including increased copayments and deductibles.
“HUCTW leaders have expressed deep concerns about exposing employees to the risk of substantial new and unpredictable out-of-pocket costs,” HUCTW leaders wrote in the email.
Harvard’s executive vice president, Katie N. Lapp, acknowledged the continued health care debate in a statement.
“Important issues, such as health care, remain to be resolved, and the University remains committed to working with the HUCTW to settle outstanding concerns,” Lapp wrote. “The University’s goal is to work out all outstanding issues timely and equitably, and to reach a new contract that advances the interests of the union and the university’s broader mission.”
Jaeger said the passage of Wednesday’s deadline will mark the “transition from an ordinary negotiation to one that’s more challenging.” Still, he said HUCTW leaders are confident that a temporary agreement extending the current policies and programs offered in the expiring contract will be put in place while the negotiations continue, a sentiment echoed in Lapp’s statement.
“As in the past, while negotiations continue, the terms of the current contract remain in full force and effect, providing HUCTW members competitive wages and benefits,” Lapp said.

The Grafton Group, a restaurant group with locations throughout Harvard Square, is planning to open an oyster bar at the site of the short-lived Kennedy’s on the Square restaurant at 15 Dunster St. The restaurant will tentatively be equipped with projector screens, stay open until 1 a.m. on weekdays, and seat up to 90 people.
The Cambridge License Commission will decide on Tuesday evening whether to transfer the existing alcohol license from Kennedy’s, which closed last March, to the new restaurant. The Commission’s official agenda for the hearing does not provide a finalized name for the oyster bar, which is referred to as “Dunster Restaurant.”
“If they pass, we should have a new restaurant in the Square by the spring,” said Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association. “We’re very excited about it.”
According to the Grafton Group’s statement, the restaurant will serve lunch and dinner daily with takeout.
“New England is full of world class oyster bars, and we are excited to bring one to the center of the neighborhood we’ve called home for nearly twenty years,” Grafton Group co-owner Patrick Lee said in the statement.
Student sentiments about the opening were generally positive.
Self-described seafood-lover Christina W. Li ’19 said she is looking forward to trying the oyster bar’s offerings.
The oyster bar is the group’s latest venture in the Square; it already owns Grafton Street Pub and Grill, Temple Bar, Russell House Tavern, and PARK. The Grafton Group is also opening its first restaurant across the Charles River in early November. The new eatery, State Street Provisions, will occupy space by the New England Aquarium, formerly occupied by City Landing.

Mark R. Johnson, vice president for Harvard capital planning and project management, will step down down from his position at the end of the October to become director of development for real estate company Divco West.
University Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, who sent an email to the Harvard’s central administration employees, lauded Johnson for his five-year tenure. Johnson could not be reached for comment.
Johnson first came to Harvard in 2002 to serve as a senior construction project manager at Harvard Business School. In 2005, he took on the role of director of major capital projects and physical planning at Harvard Law School, overseeing the construction of the Wasserstein Hall, Caspersen Student Center, Clinical Wing.
Throughout Johnson’s tenure, Harvard underwent frequent and major construction. In 2012, he oversaw the Science Center Plaza’s renovation as part of the Harvard’s Common Spaces program. More recently, Johnson played a part in the designs of the Smith Campus Center, which will feature the renovation and addition of common spaces on the first, second, and 10th floors. After two hearings this summer, the University is still awaiting final approval of the plans from the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal. 
As the Harvard has pursued massive construction in Allston, Johnson assisted in developing the University’s 10-year Allston Institutional Master Plan.
Closer to Cambridge, he oversaw the nearly $250 million and six-year renovation of the Harvard Art Museums that concluded with their grand opening last November.
At the College, Johnson helped plan the more than $1 billion House renewal project, which is funded in part by Harvard’s $6.5 billion capital campaign. The campaign has surpassed its $6 billion mark, with House renewal lagging behind many other Faculty of Arts and Sciences priorities. The renovations completed so far have drawn some criticism for their move toward hall common rooms and bathrooms at the expense of private space.
Quincy’s Stone Hall was the first residence renovated, opening in 2013, followed by Leverett’s Mckinlock Hall in 2014 and Dunster House, which reopened to residents this year. Winthrop House will undergo renovation starting this summer, followed by Lowell in 2017-2018.

Businesses located in Harvard’s Smith Campus Center, including local institutions like Al’s Harvard Square Cafe and the Square location of Clover Food Lab, must vacate their spaces in the next several months to make way for planned renovations, according to Harvard spokesperson Brigid O’Rourke.
“The reality is that the Smith Campus Center will be an active construction zone for some time, with a specific focus on renovating the arcade and other areas of the building,” O’Rourke wrote in an email. “Because of this, all retail tenants will need to move out by the Spring of 2016.”
Officials have previously indicated that some local businesses will need to move, some permanently and some possibly only temporarily, as Harvard renovates the building formerly known as the Holyoke Center at 1350 Massachusetts Ave. next year through 2018. Preliminary plans include creating a network of meeting rooms, common spaces, and lockers that will span the renovated first, second, and 10th floors of the building.
Previously, though, representatives from Harvard have declined to specify which businesses would need to leave the space and when. When asked to clarify, O’Rourke confirmed Monday that businesses on the periphery of the building, including the restaurant Au Bon Pain and Clover, will also have to move out early next year.
The news comes as a steady trickle of businesses have left the building as Harvard has worked to finalize construction plans. Finale dessert shop closed its Smith Center location last winter; Harvard Student Agencies relocated its cleaners operation to Mount Auburn Street in August; and the Harvard University Employees Credit Union has also left the space.
The impending displacement of the several businesses that still populate the campus center building—many of which are ingrained in the local landscape and the schedules of Harvard undergraduates and local residents alike—will represent a major change for Harvard Square.
According to HSA President Patrick F. Scott ’16, the student-run business heard that both of its Smith Center shops, the Cleaners location and a branch of the apparel store the Harvard Shop, would need to leave the building by early 2016.
Scott said planners gave HSA notice last academic year that they would need to move out. But despite the notice from Harvard, Scott said losing the campus center Harvard Shop location is nonetheless a loss for the organization.
“Losing a store is always a blow; we get a lot of revenue from that store, so it’s a blow in that sense,” Scott said. “In the sense of making us seriously concerned for our future, I think we’ve prepared enough that we’ll be able to absorb it.”
Al’s Harvard Square Cafe—the local sandwich eatery and purveyor of the famous Al’s bag lunch, a staple among students—will also move out of the Smith Center in early 2016, according to manager Carlos Chicas. Al’s will likely move out around the start of April, he said, and in the meantime managers are searching for a new location.
It remains unclear which, if any, of the food stops will move back into the Smith Center once construction concludes in 2018. Early this year, Tanya Iatridis, the senior director of University planning overseeing the project, said she expected the renovated campus center to include the same number of food options as it does now, if not more. But on Monday, O’Rourke said planners have not yet decided which food vendors will be allowed to operate in the renovated building.
Denise A. Jillson, the executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the changes are not a surprise, given the scope of the planned Smith Center renovations. Nevertheless, she called it a “distressing,” but overall positive, change for the Square.
“People love Al’s and Oggi, and they love b.good. These are all valued, valued members, not only of the Association, but of the Square,” Jillson said. “We hope that we will find places for them in the Square. … Of course it’s distressing that the businesses have to be displaced.”
In August, the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal delayed approval of Harvard’s proposed plans for the Smith Center’s renovation.

The Office of Student Life has hired Loc Truong to serve as its new director of diversity and inclusion programs, a position within the College’s new Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
Truong previously served as the assistant director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, from 2008 to 2015, according to Emelyn A. dela Peña, the College's assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion who emailed her colleagues about the hiring last week.
In his new role, Truong will report to dela Peña and serve as the “point person to student organizations and provide support for first generation college students, undocumented students, and foster youth,” dela Peña wrote in her email.
His new position will involve collaborating with other College diversity offices, such as the Harvard College Women’s Center, the College’s Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and the Harvard Foundation. He will also work with a team on new initiatives like an intergroup dialogue program and the diversity peer educator program, in addition to working with specialty tutors and proctors.
Truong’s hiring fills a void in leadership at the new OSL’s newest office and coincides with another mid-level administrative transition within the College’s bureaucracy.
Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich will serve as the OSL’s associate dean for residential life. Friedrich previously oversaw student organizations and assumes the residential life job after William Cooper ’94 left the position over the summer. 
The College will conduct a national search for Friedrich’s successor, according to Dean of Student Life Stephen Lassonde. Friedrich will take on the added responsibility of managing his successor, who will report to him.
“It’s actually a promotion because he has more responsibility than Will had,” Lassonde said. “David wanted the experience in residential life, and he’s perfect, he knows everybody, and he knows the institution really well.”
The staff transition comes as the College continues to focus its resources on Harvard’s more than $1 billion House renewal project, and in his new position, Friedrich will likely play a part in the planning process.
So far, Harvard has renovated portions of Quincy and Leverett Houses and all of Dunster House, which reopened to residents this fall. After a roughly year-long break in construction, Winthrop House will undergo renewal starting next summer, and Lowell House will follow in 2017-2018.
Along with House renewal, the College has also recently poured resources into the Houses to create more inclusive social spaces in the wake of administrators’ concerns over the influence of off-campus final clubs on the undergraduate social scene.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: October 9, 2015, at 5:10 p.m.
A panel of legal and medical scholars and practitioners agreed in a panel discussion on Monday night that the American criminal justice system does not give adequate consideration to the cognitive underdevelopment of adolescents.
The death sentence of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the American student who carried out the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, served as a preface for the discussion.
A standing-room-only crowd of about 100 people packed the Wasserstein Hall classroom at Harvard Law School for the discussion entitled “From Troubled Teens to Tsarnaev: Promises and Perils of Adolescent Neuroscience and Law.” The event, hosted by the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics, was the center’s first of the year and a collaboration with the Center for Law, Brain and Behavior at Massachusetts General Hospital. 
“Our country is going through a profound movement toward the punitive,” said Nancy Gertner, a senior lecturer at the Law School.
In a previous editorial in the Boston Globe, Gertner cited prominent lawyer Clarence S. Darrow’s argument that “the imposition of the death penalty made citizens no better than the killers on trial.” She argued that modern neuroscience research can provide objective grounds for greater discretion in sentencing juvenile criminals.
Leah Somerville, director of the Affective Neuroscience and Development Lab at the University, struck a similar note.
“The adolescent brain is structurally different from the adult brain,” she said.
These objective differences between adult and juvenile brains, resulting in measurable decreases in inhibition, underdeveloped resistance to peer pressure, and increased attraction to risk, should be given more consideration when sentencing juvenile criminals, according to Somerville.
The panelists described the need to apply the findings from modern neuroscience and criminal justice research to programs that aim to support at-risk youth. They also discussed the need to strengthen programs aimed at promoting healthy environments for adolescents, keeping students in school, and rehabilitating youth offenders.
“Individual sentencing cannot solve this issue,” Gertner said. “We have to look at this problem institutionally.”
Panelist Robert T. Kinscherff, a senior visiting fellow in law and applied neuroscience at the Petrie-Flom Center and the Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior, said there is a need for increased understanding of the very common conditions that lead to youth delinquency. He also spoke of the “growing political agreement” that—rather than being tough on crime—the U.S. Department of Justice should be “smart on crime.”
The panelists were hopeful about enacting change. Describing how to implement these scientific breakthroughs, Judge Gertner emphasized the importance of objective neuroscience in strengthening the argument for programs to support at-risk youth and discretion when sentencing young criminals.
“It’s no longer just faith and hope and some gut, common-sense solution,” Gertner said. “You can actually look at the [neurological] differences, and we need to take them into account.”
But some audience members left the event with mixed feelings about the potential for change. Takahiko Iwasaki, a Japanese judge and visiting scholar at the Law School, said, “I think it’s very difficult for lawyers or judges to actually take into account these [scientific] accomplishments in specific cases.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is the first part in an occasional series on the College’s Program in General Education.
As the College reviews its General Education program that is “failing on a variety of fronts,” its New Haven rival has maintained a set of distribution requirements as its core curriculum—an option available here but favored by neither the committee reviewing the program nor most members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, who must vote on any large-scale reforms.
In 2011, Yale reviewed its program—which was first implemented for the class of 2009—without recommendations for major structural changes. Instead, it maintained a system that requires students to take classes in the major fields of arts and humanities, science, and social science. Yale students must also take courses intended to develop their skills in writing, foreign language, and quantitative reasoning.
Unlike Harvard’s program, courses that count for Yale’s distribution requirements only come from departments. Harvard students have the option of fulfilling their Gen Ed requirements with departmental courses or those from one of the eight categories, like “Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding” or “Societies of the World.” 
Many faculty members argue that Harvard’s Gen Ed program should be reformed, rather than replaced with a system like Yale’s, emphasizing that distribution requirements would not fit Harvard’s academic culture. Undergraduates specialize naturally in their academic pursuits at Harvard, where departments are often fairly segmented, and encourage students to participate in research in their particular fields, said Anthropology professor Mary M. Steedly, a member of the Committee on General Education.
Distribution requirements like Yale’s would not necessarily give students the more expansive understanding that the Gen Ed program was designed to give, according to English professor Louis Menand.
According to the Yale program’s website, these requirements “constitute a minimal education, not a complete one, and represent the least that an educated person should seek to know.” 
Not everyone at Yale fully supports the distribution model. To Bryan Garsten, chair of the humanities program at Yale, the “minimal education” aim is not ambitious enough. It is less work for faculty to offer courses in a distributional system as opposed to one like Harvard’s and is not geared for students who are less familiar with different academic fields.
Harvard’s faculty, he said, has a unique opportunity to collaborate and create a cohesive program intended to play a large part in an undergraduate’s academic experience.
The Gen Ed program has yet to live up to that expectation, however, and one of the most significant obstacles for the College’s core curriculum, as outlined in the review and by faculty members, is the lack of a perceived role for Gen Ed in the undergraduate experience here.
Menand, who headed the committee that crafted the current Gen Ed program in 2006, said the program’s identity at Harvard fell short of comparable curricula at other Ivy League schools as well.
He cited Brown, which has no core curriculum whatsoever, as a counterexample to Harvard. Students attend Brown partly because that lack of a core is well publicized and considered a key part of the “Brown experience,” Menand said. Columbia’s Core Curriculum, in which all freshmen take the same courses, is another example where accepted students are very aware of how it fits into their academic lives once they arrive.
Similarly, “Gen Ed has to become a part of the College’s larger identity,” Menand said.
The Gen Ed review committee will present a final draft of recommendations to faculty members at a town hall meeting on Tuesday. Sean D. Kelly, the chair of the committee, hopes that faculty will vote to approve a new general education program by the end of the semester.

Following Harvard Medical School’s launch of its newly renovated curriculum, “Pathways,” deans and professors from peer medical schools commended Harvard’s change and said it mirrored in many cases their own curricular shifts.
The first major redesign of its early curriculum since the 1980s, Harvard’s change integrates multiple disciplines into single courses and introduces earlier clinical immersion and flipped classrooms.
The Medical School’s curriculum overhaul comes after some peer leading medical schools implemented their own curricular changes in recent years. One such medical school is Columbia’s College of Physicians and Surgeons. Lee Goldman, the school’s dean, said Columbia underwent a similar change in fall 2009, suggesting that the idea of introducing a more interactive medical school curriculum is not itself novel. 
A curriculum change can have a large impact on a student body. Representatives from peer schools that recently adjusted their own systems suggested that administrators must communicate closely with students to tailor and fine-tune a curriculum, stressing that their own changes were very much a team process, rather than a top-down decision.
According to Nancy C. Andrews, dean of the Duke University School of Medicine and a 1985 graduate of Harvard Medical School, Harvard’s curricular change is part of a broader shift in medical education from asking students to memorize material to emphasizing its application.
Harvard’s new curriculum, Andrews said, “looks a lot like Duke’s.”
“I think in the future and now already it’s much less about memorizing and more about learning concepts and learning to ask the right questions and find the details rather rote memorization,” she said. “We see our curriculum as being a way to develop critical thinking more than just doing an information download.”
Rajesh S. Mangrulkar, the University of Michigan’s associate dean for medical student education, suggested that students have responded positively to “this new direction.”
“Students seem energized by the changes and the opportunity to both contribute to the future of medical education, and be a recipient of it," Mangrulkar wrote in an email. “I think we all are appropriately anxious about dramatically transforming our program, but in many ways, the students have provided a lot of the courage and energy to the faculty to overcome this natural reluctance to dramatic change.”
According to Charles G. Prober, a senior associate dean of medical education at Stanford, most medical schools have been following the same general guidelines since the release of the Flexner Report in the early 20th century, which established standard requirements for students applying to medical school. The main components of Harvard’s curriculum change—shortening preclinical time and incorporating more flipped classrooms—mirror a larger trend across the country, Prober said.
Stanford launched its own medicine interactive learning initiative in recent years, introducing a collaborative series of videos and interactive sessions.
“They’re apples and oranges,” Prober said. “Stanford’s is a pedagogical approach that is a way to deliver content. The Harvard curriculum… [has]... looked across thoughtfully and said, 'How can we make the full package more effective?’ We’re all trying to accomplish the same thing.”
Robert J. Alpern, the dean of Yale Medical School, said Harvard’s curriculum change is similar to a revision at Yale that was released in August.
“The new curriculum seems excellent,” Alpern wrote in an email. “Moving away from individual discipline-based courses to more integrated teaching is where we all need to go. Many schools are moving in a similar direction.”
Nancy Hueppchen, associate dean for curriculum at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, has observed increasing numbers of medical schools undergoing similar curricular changes. She hypothesized that the change was driven by “new innovations in medicine as well as new needs in medicine.”
“You have to have ways to teach translational medicine,” she said.
Still, peer school administrators did express some concerns about the curricular change. The University of Washington will implement a change to its medical school curriculum this semester, coinciding with the move at Harvard, and Suzanne M. Allen, Washington medical school’s vice dean, suggested that meeting academic needs while still allowing students freedom in their learning could pose a challenge. With a style of teaching that is new to both professors and students, there is the risk that both groups may be tempted to assume their traditional classroom roles, she said.
Prober suggested that collaboration and sharing ideas are central to medical school curricular reform moving forward.
“We’re constantly cherry-picking other people’s ideas,” Prober said. “I don’t think there will be another ‘Pathways’ that pops up immediately somewhere else. Elements may well pop up somewhere else. We’re all poaching on each other and I think that should be encouraged.”

A panel of local thought leaders representing the private sector, K-12 education, and post-secondary schooling discussed best practices for aligning education with industry needs at a panel Monday night.
At the event, organized by the Harvard Business School Association of Boston, the panelists advocated for building a more experiential curriculum into the education system in order to better reconcile education with changing workforce demands, especially in the tech space.
In order for the United States to maintain its place as some sort of world industry leader, education needs to prepare students better for the needs of industry and the workforce, said Anthony G. Benoit, president of Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, a private nonprofit college specializing in two-year vocational degrees.
Robert B. Schwartz, professor of practice at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, agreed with Benoit that vocational degree programs, which Benoit termed “vo-tech,” are of growing importance. Vo-tech, as defined by Benoit, encompasses jobs like lab technician, and other “middle skill jobs,” which make up nearly 30 percent of the state labor force.
Despite having one of the most educated workforces in the country, Massachusetts is facing a hiring shortage, said Schwartz. In particular, many available jobs require technical knowledge, an oft-neglected subset of what he called the “high skill, high wage economy.”
“The recent interest and investment in vo-tech high schools is a positive trend for a couple reasons,” Benoit said. “One, it is aligning high school education with the workplace. That’s a great thing. It is also reminding people about the value of a lot of the work that people do. ”
Benoit traced the evolution of popular opinion surrounding vocational education, as it shifted from second-rate training to a sought-after qualification.
“We went through a period of time, really a whole generation of people who were told you should not work with your hands,” Benoit said. “Work which uses the hands has been devalued.”
Susan K. Fallon, vice president of global strategy and business development at the online employment site Monster.com, and David Harris completed the panel and reiterated the importance of vocational and technical education for meeting workforce needs.
Fallon identified practical field experience as an invaluable part of landing a job, especially in saturated hiring environments like Massachusetts or California. She highlighted the value of supplementing an advanced degree with internships, to build professional skills.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s hard to stand out on a team with a 16-game winning streak. It’s hard to stand out on a defense that ranked first in the FCS in points allowed last year.
And it’s certainly hard to stand out on a night when six different teammates scored as part of a 53-27 rout against a conference foe.
But last Saturday, senior linebacker Jacob Lindsey did all three.
In the Harvard football team’s Ivy opener against Brown, Lindsey played a pivotal role in shifting the momentum the Crimson’s way.
With 9:05 left in the first quarter, the Brown offense trotted onto the field needing to score after a touchdown by senior running back Paul Stanton, Jr. had given Harvard a 7-0 lead.
At this point, on their second drive of the game, the Bears came out looking for a big play.
Senior quarterback Marcus Fuller fired a pass to junior wide receiver Alex Jette that fell incomplete. On second down, Brown settled for a two-yard run by senior running back Seth Rosenbauer.
Then it happened.
On third and eight, with Fuller dropping back and the Bears pinned deep in their own territory, Crimson senior defensive back Sean Ahern came streaking in on a cornerback blitz and knocked the ball out of Fuller’s hand.
Using what every football player learns on his first day of practice, Lindsey saw the loose ball, scooped it up, and scored. Harvard forced four Brown turnovers on the night.
After the linebacker’s return touchdown, the Crimson was up, 14-0, less than seven minutes into the contest. The pendulum didn’t swing in the Bears’ favor the rest of the night. Harvard forced a three-and-out on the next possession, and the Crimson amassed a 37-0 lead by halftime.
“Sean did a great job coming out the edge,” Lindsey said. “That was something we game-planned for…. It was cool tonight because the gloves were sticky. I was able to hang onto that ball and obviously take it in.”
Along with scoring the first touchdown of his career at Harvard, Lindsey finished the game with a team-leading 10 tackles, twice as many as the next highest player.
His performance Saturday fell just short of his career-high of 12 tackles coming against Cornell last season.
After two games, Lindsey leads the team in tackles for the season with 17.
He is one of three seniors in the squad’s starting linebacker corps, including captain Matt Koran and senior Eric Medes.
“Really, all three of us have had significant reps,” Lindsey said. “It makes it a lot easier just as a unit where we all trust each other, and we’ve played with each other for the last 12 games…. We can go around making plays as needed.”
Partly led by Lindsey, the defensive unit has allowed an average of just 344 yards and 18.5 points per game this season.
And Harvard’s strong defense is balanced by its prowess on the offensive side of the ball, where it has averaged 455 yards and 47 points in its first two contests.
“Our defense is by far one of the best defenses in the Ivy League, if not in the nation,” senior defensive back Asante Gibson said.
“We have the potential to do a lot more than we’ve shown. We have to keep working hard and playing as a team. When we start playing as individuals, we’ll mess up. As soon as we start playing as a team, we’re good to go,” he added.
For Lindsey, these defensive expectations are nothing new.
The senior linebacker has been an integral part of the defense over the last four years, racking up 130 total tackles despite missing seven games in the 2013 season.
Last season, he led the Crimson with 63 tackles and was selected for the All-Ivy second team.
Not counting the season in which he played in less than half the games, Lindsey has averaged over five tackles a game since his freshman year.
However, last Saturday’s scoop-and-score was the first fumble recovery of his career.
“We’ve had great leadership,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “Our coaches have done a tremendous job.... But anytime you have seven starters back on a quality unit, you expect good things.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roommates, best friends, and teammates.
Sophomores Nikki Kallenberg and Annika Ringblom satisfy all those descriptions, but for one, hard-fought match, they met as opponents in the championship match of the Brown Invitational top singles flight.
Though it was Ringblom who came out on top last weekend at the Harvard Fall Classic, it was No. 98 Kallenberg who edged Ringblom in three sets this weekend, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(3).
“It was really great because we could play a match and really leave it all on the court,” said Ringblom, when asked about facing Kallenberg.
“It was a really good match, it was close, and both of us were really happy about how we played. To play a competitive match, leave the court, and still be best friends is nice,” she added.
While she lost a tight match in the final of her singles flight, Ringblom was not to be denied a spot at the top of the podium, winning the tournament’s top doubles flight with her partner, senior Amanda Lin. The win marked the team’s second doubles win of the fall season.
She and Lin were partnered just days before leaving for Rhode Island, only getting a chance to practice together for a couple of hours.
Despite the short time frame, they secured an 8-0 victory over the Boston University squad of Johanna Hytoy and Sabrina Faybyshev in their first match together before winning, 8-1, against Rutgers ladies Gina Li and Mariam Zein.
Ringblom and Lin eventually faced off against Ana Yrazusta Acosta and Carol Benito of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst in the championship, winning, 8-5.
“Annika [Ringblom] worked a lot over the summer, playing tennis and doing a lot of interesting things,” said Harvard coach Traci Green of her sophomore standout. “She came back ready to go, and I’m proud to see all of her hard work pay off.”
Ringblom’s has found a measure of success early in the season, despite being asked to play both singles and doubles at a high level. For her part, the sophomore also views her offseason training as having played an integral part in her fast start to the fall season.
“It’s really exciting to see that all the hard work I put in this summer is paying off,” Ringblom said. “You can only get so good technically in tennis, but to really go to another level you have to work on your fitness.”
This tournament featured a number of flights for both singles and doubles.
The championship match of each flight was populated by Harvard women, which was a welcome sight for the team.
“For the freshmen, it is good for them to see that we are winning tournaments and flights,” junior June Lee said. “For the upperclassmen, it keeps us motivated and encouraged…. It keeps everything exciting.”
Lee and freshman Isabelle Jasper won their doubles flight with an 8-6 victory over the St. John’s duo of Delia Arranz and Stephanie Elgegren.
This win followed an 8-3 win in the semifinals against Brown’s Coco Hsu and Ammu Mandalap.
Kallenberg also performed well in doubles, playing with captain Amy He in the same flight as Ringblom and Lin.
Kallenberg and He won their first match handily, 8-1, over the St. John’s team of Anna Morozova and Zofia Stanisz.
They followed that up with a loss to eventual finalists Acosta and Benito of UMass-Amherst, but rebounded well with an 8-1 win over Brown tandem Kaite Ta and Hannah Camhi.
They were handed a defeat in their final match of the tournament, falling to Hytoy and Faybyshev of BU, 8-0.
The Crimson was also quite successful in the singles category, as evidenced by the all-Harvard final in the top flight.
Lin, Ringblom’s title-winning partner in doubles, finished as the runner-up in her singles flight.
She started the tournament off with a straightforward victory, defeating Carol Benito of UMass-Amherst 6-3, 6-4 on Friday.
She carried the momentum of that victory over to Saturday, overcoming a shaky start to defeat Stony Brook University’s Ana Carrion Rodriguez 1-6, 7-5, 6-2.
Lin was ultimately undone in the final, falling 6-1, 6-4 to Boston University’s Faybyshev, who took home the championship.

We received the heart-wrenching news on September 17, 2015 from a Crimson Crave article that our beloved Al’s, the Italian sub shop in the Smith Campus Center, will be forced to relocate following plans to make the Center a hub for student activity.
I couldn’t fathom the idea of not having my oven roasted turkey bag lunch available so I had to go see for myself if this was all true and what, if any, were the plans for the future of Al’s Café.
The manager and part-owner of Al’s, Carlos Chicas, told me that it was at the beginning of this past summer when the Harvard Campus Center notified him about the planned renewal which would force the eviction of several restaurants in the Center.
“We want to relocate in the Square but as of now there really is no space for us, we’re not really sure about where we will go,” said Chicas.
I tell him how much Harvard students enjoy the gargantuan subs that Al’s serves and how #blessed we are to have them in a central location on campus. “I know, we’ve been here for four years now, we’re really hoping to stay in the Square,” he says.
While the future may not be so certain for Al’s, Carlos tells me that the Café will still be serving their famous subs until the last days of April of next year and by then he hopes that they will have found a new home in Harvard Square. In the meanwhile, make sure to get yourself some of these delicious sandwiches because as they say “here one day, and gone the next”.

Last Friday, as part of its ICA After 5 series, the Institute of Contemporary Art hosted a workshop on latte art and Instagram, drawing dozens of coffee lovers and photographers to the museum. As the sun set over the bay, two baristas from Black Magic Coffee Co. demonstrated their art form by producing intricate swirls, hearts, and swans on the surface of a latte in a white mug. This Roving Reporter spoke with some of the workshop leaders and participants to find out more.
David M. Simon and Joe R. Smith, baristas
Roving Reporter: Would you consider latte art an art form, and, if so, how do you feel about an art form that’s so temporary?
DS: I think it’s most definitely an art form.
JS: I think it’s important…. If you’re going to spend four dollars on a latte or a cappuccino, it might as well look pretty too.
RR: Do you ever not make a design?
JS: That’s called a whiteout. I competed at a world latte art championships a couple years ago in New York…. I was so nervous because there was a big audience and it was streamed online. I was shaking so hard, I was sloshing the drink out of the cup. And it came out just white.
RR: If you could give a total beginner one tip on making latte art, what would it be?
JS: It really just all comes from practice. Some people get it within the first month…. It took me almost a year before I was able to pour anything. In the end it’s all muscle memory.
Julie A. Ciollo, Instagram instructor
RR: How did you become involved with this event?
JC: A friend of mine put me in touch with the ICA because he knew they were putting this event on and…that I had a big appreciation for photography, coffee, and taking pictures of my coffee.
RR: How did you feel about trying latte art?
JC: It made me feel not so smart. I really appreciate it, so…I want to try to do it myself…. You have to be really good at getting the texture of the milk just so, and having really good hand technique. I think I’m still learning on both of those counts.
Joanna Lee and Sarah Jung, participants
RR: Is coffee a morning necessity?
SH: I’ve become dependent on coffee since I moved to Boston. Boston is, like, coffee signs everywhere.
RR: Do you usually get lattes with pretty designs?
SH: Yeah, and I always feel bad, because I usually have to cover it with a cap, so you only see it for one second.
RR: Do you think a prettier latte tastes better?
SH: It makes me happy. I don’t know if it tastes better…. I don’t know if happier people taste more delicious things. But it definitely makes me smile.
JL: I don’t usually drink coffee, but this makes me want to drink coffee. It’s just fun.
Akshay Verma ’17, inactive Crimson Arts editor and participant
RR: Did you come more for the Instagram or for the latte art?
AV: I would say both equally. I love coffee a lot, and I love Instagram. So it was a match made in heaven.
RR: Is coffee a morning necessity?
AV: Yes, definitely. And an afternoon necessity, too.
RR: Where do you like to get your coffee?
AV: I try to avoid HUDS because it’s very bad coffee, but…at 1 a.m. I will do that. But other than that, on campus I usually go to the Barker Center on my way to class. If I’m desperate, I’ll go to the Science Center or Lamont.
RR: Do you think a prettier latte tastes better?
AV: If anything’s prettier I’ll like it better.
RR: Do you think the temporary nature of latte art makes it more valuable?
AV: I think there’s something beautiful about how it’s temporary. [If] you take a sip or if you stir it too much, it’s gone, and it’s your fault. There’s something poetic about that.
Morgan M. Phelps, Katrina L. Nibbi and Lindsay A. Higgins, Boston University students and participants
RR: What’s your favorite latte flavor at Starbucks?
LH: I’ve tried the pumpkin, but I didn’t like it. I don’t know what all the hype was about.
RR: What excited you more about this workshop: the latte art, or learning how to Instagram it?
MP: I’d say just the latte art…. He makes it look easy, but then you watch people try it and they’re spilling all over the place.
RR: Do you think a prettier latte tastes better?
MP: Yeah, it improves the whole experience.
KN: But if it had a design on it, it might not be as good, because you let it get cold.
LH: Or you don’t want to drink it because it’s so pretty.
RR: Do you think the temporary nature of latte art makes it more rare and valuable?
LH: I think it’s more valuable because only two people can see it. The person who makes it sees it and you see it, and you can enjoy it for a moment, and then it’s gone. It’s more personal.
