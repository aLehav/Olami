After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JERUSALEM, Israel—We were standing on a precipice, the holiest city in the world sprawling down, up, and across the mountainous topography in front of us. A single shining golden dome demarcated the center—of the city, of monotheistic religion, of history, of everything.
Families and tour groups alike head to this lookout for one last glimpse at the city before heading to the airport. I imagine most Jews who visit the site on their way home mutter the promise to return, “next year in Jerusalem,” as they take their last look at the old city in the distance. I imagine that as they witness this final, breathtaking view, they really mean their words.
The day that I went to this lookout, the holy city was tainted. Just beyond the glittering Dome of the Rock, a thick cloud of black smoke, still billowing, cut across the cloudless blue sky. As our tour guide recited historical facts that I have heard time and time again—the 1948 UN partition, the Six Day War That Was Really Seven Days and the 1967 green line, the first intifada and the second—the sound of bullets ricocheted through the air. The tour guide told us not to worry. The bullets were made of rubber.
Unlike other Jews who visited the site, I couldn’t keep my eyes focused on this view of Jerusalem. I was compelled to keep reloading my Twitter feed to find out if anyone had died in the distance.
We walked away from the lookout as the smoke dissipated into the sky. We boarded the bus and found out from a news alert that three Palestinians had been killed by police in the Al-Aqsa protests that day. We woke up the next morning and found out that three Jews had been murdered by a Palestinian terrorist in a West Bank settlement overnight.
Next year in Jerusalem. These words are meant to bring hope to the Jews everywhere. But the scene unfolding in front of my eyes felt hopeless. The protests over security measures at Al-Aqsa have halted, but the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians continues, and the conflict over Jerusalem continues. Americans, ever the optimists, promise that every problem has a solution. But as I watched yet another conflict unfold in the old city, I felt my American optimism lose out to logic.
One speaker at a geopolitics conference I attended in Israel remarked that Jerusalem could never be divided, unless, he sarcastically added, the border was at the Kotel. In grim jest, he pointed out perhaps the most insurmountable issue of indivisibility in human history: that the old city, only 0.35 square miles, cannot possibly be bargained for or divided.
I had naively thought that being in Israel would illuminate the answer to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and prove to me which side is more right—as if there were such a thing—and what the solution should be. But instead of adding clarity, each day here has revealed another complexity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Justice Department’s decision to investigate Harvard’s admissions practices for possible discrimination against Asian Americans has left some students feeling disappointed and worried about the future of affirmative action at the University.
The Department publicly vowed to examine Harvard’s admissions process on August 2. Justice Department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said at the time that the investigation will focus on a single complaint filed in 2015 by 64 Asian-American groups that alleges Harvard unfairly denied admission to qualified Asian-American applicants.
In wake of this news, many Harvard students—still scattered around the world awaiting the beginning of the academic year on Aug. 30—took to the Internet to make their thoughts known.
Damian Richardson ’20 called the investigation “[President Donald] Trump’s shameless affirmative action attack” in an opinion piece for USA Today. Several other students also critiqued the Department’s plan in op-eds published by The Crimson. Still more undergraduates—as well as alumni—opined about the investigation in posts on Facebook and Twitter.
“It has sparked a lot of discussion on campus and on social media,” said Nawal K. Arjini ’18, who previously filed to intervene in support of Harvard in a separate, ongoing lawsuit that accuses the University of race-based discrimination in its admissions process.
Arjini said she was personally unsurprised by the new investigation “given who the Department of Justice is headed by”—United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has drawn criticism for his record on civil rights issues and his opposition to legislation authors say advance the rights of women and LGBTQ individuals. But, Arjini added, she is “really scared” of the investigation’s potential outcome—she worries it may lead to the demise of race-conscious admissions at Harvard.
“I think for many reasons affirmative action is vitally important to the University, to the community of the University, to everyone’s educational and social experiences, and to larger system problems of addressing questions of institutional racism,” she said.
Arjini said she thinks student discussion about affirmative action spurred by the investigation “is a really good conversation to have,” but not if it comes at the expense of losing affirmative action.
Sidney C. Li ’19, who co-coordinates an undergraduate task force that advocates for more Asian and Pacific American curricular offerings at Harvard, was broadly critical of the Justice Department investigation but also said he thought the move might have a silver lining. Li said he believes one “good thing” the examination may produce is “further knowledge of the statistics” surrounding Harvard’s admissions process.
Still, Li said he did not think additional data—or renewed campus debate—was likely to sway most Harvard students’ opinions on the issue.
“I think most of the people I know at Harvard, including Asian Americans, see there is a lot more to being a student here than just having good grades and everyone appreciates the diversity here and wishes there was more,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard moved one step closer to naming its next president Tuesday when it unveiled the membership of two committees that will advise the search for University President Drew G. Faust’s successor.
Photography professor Robin Kelsey, the dean of Arts and Humanities for FAS, will chair the 13-member faculty committee, and executive vice president Katie Lapp will chair the nine-member staff committee. Members hail from across the University’s schools and disciplines, with only the School of Dental Medicine unrepresented.
As the search committee—comprised of all 12 members of the Harvard Corporation and three members of the Board of Overseers—amasses a list of possible candidates, it will consult these groups to glean what qualities and backgrounds they’d like to see in the next president. It plans to unveil a student advisory committee later this summer, according to a press release.
At a university whose faculty is prone to flare-ups with administrators over governance—and brought about the downfall of at least one president—faculty engagement in the search will be critical to the next president’s success. The advisory committee will provide a channel through which Harvard’s professors can influence the process.
“Our faculty drive the intellectual ambitions and the academic excellence of this extraordinary University, and we’re very grateful to these distinguished professors from across Harvard for their willingness to devote their time and insights to the critical effort ahead,” William F. Lee, who is the senior fellow of the Harvard Corporation and chair of the search committee, said in a statement.
The staff committee will work with central administrators and members of the Administrative Council across Harvard’s schools to garner the perspectives of employees and convey them to the search committee.
The search committee has also been soliciting advice and nominations through a designated email address since last month, and Lee wrote in the press release that it has already received hundreds of submissions. The committee plans to name Faust’s successor before she departs in June 2018.
The full composition of the faculty committee is as follows: Kelsey, Law professor William Alford, Graduate School of Design professor Anita Berrizbeitia, Divinity School professor Catherine Brekus, Medical School professor Stephen Elledge, Kennedy School professor and former dean David Ellwood, FAS dean of social science Claudine Gay, biology professor Hopi Hoekstra, Graduate School of Education professor Bridget Terry Long, Business School professor Youngme Moon, philosophy professor Alison Simmons, SEAS professor Salil Vadhan, and School of Public Health professor Dyann Wirth.
The staff committee includes: Lapp, Divinity School Executive Dean Patricia M. Byrne, Business School Executive Dean for Administration Angela Q. Crispi, Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann, Graduate School of Education Executive Dean for Administration Jack Jennings, FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie Kirwan, Deputy General Counsel Diane E. Lopez, Radcliffe Executive Dean Nisha Mongia, and Vice President for Campus Services Meredith Weenick.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The committee that proposed a ban on social groups at Harvard College will consult with faculty and students before releasing a final revised report on Sept. 25, according to an email sent to faculty Wednesday morning.
Last month, the committee, charged with reevaluating Harvard’s year-old social group penalties, recommended that the College forbid students from joining all “fraternities, sororities, and similar organizations”—including co-ed groups—with the goal of phasing out these groups by May 2022.
Committee co-chairs Music professor Suzannah E. Clark and Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in the email that the committee will consult with faculty and students about the contents of the report in the early weeks of the fall term before revising the document. The committee’s work is meant to revise or replace Harvard’s existing penalties on social group membership;  the committee will now begin to revise the revisions it initially proposed.
In its 22-page report, the committee had labeled its recommendations “preliminary” and announced its plans to hold “open faculty discussions” before presenting the report to University President Drew G. Faust. The Crimson reported in early July that only seven members of the 27-member committee had voted for the social group ban during the committee’s deliberations, renewing concerns from some Faculty members about how the College was formulating its social group policy.
The committee plans to hold three drop-in faculty-only discussion sessions on Sept. 11, Sept. 14, and Sept. 15 in buildings across campus, according to the email.
“The purpose of these meetings is to give the faculty an opportunity to discuss with members of the Committee the preliminary recommendations, to ask questions about the report, to offer constructive criticism of the report, or to share any new ideas faculty may have,” the email reads.
Several committee members will be present at each of these meetings, and the committee plans to install a record-keeper who will summarize what was said for later “review” by the full committee. In their email, Clark and Khurana also invited faculty members to provide feedback via email.
The committee intends to solicit further feedback from several other faculty bodies including the Faculty Council, the Committee on Student Life, the Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, the Administrative Board, and the Education Policy Committee. Clark and Khurana noted that students sit on three of these committees and wrote that “feedback” from these students “will also be taken into consideration.”
The Office of Student Life will gather broader student feedback in the “coming weeks,” seeking “substantial engagement for enhancing Harvard College student social life and life in the Houses,” according to the email.
Some Harvard faculty have long charged that administrators’ attempts to regulate undergraduate social life have gone forward without adequate faculty input. The faculty committee, though created in part to address these concerns, has also drawn criticism from professors who feel they are being left out of the process.
In particular, professors say they are concerned that—as laid out in the committee’s original report—Faust, and not the Faculty, will have final say over the social group recommendations.
“We look forward to further faculty consultation about the Committee’s recommendations in the fall term ahead of our final report,” Khurana and Clark wrote in closing.
