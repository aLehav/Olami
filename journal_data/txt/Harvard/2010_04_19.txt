After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Headed into this past weekend, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team had not defeated Princeton since Michael Keaton was still playing Batman.
But that all changed Saturday afternoon.
Behind a balanced offense and a strong defense, the Crimson (6-6, 2-3 Ivy) ended its 17-year drought against the Tigers (5-8, 3-2), preserving an early lead to come away with the 11-9 victory on Alumni Day at Harvard Stadium.
“I think we played how we know we can play all year,” said sophomore Melanie Baskind, who, along with freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen, had a team-high three goals. “It’s really nice just to put it together and beat a big-time team like that. You can see us building and getting better each game.”
Despite falling behind in the contest’s opening minutes, the Crimson rebounded, going on a 6-2 run to finish the half. Harvard’s lead ballooned to as many as five points early in the second frame thanks to a score from freshman Danielle Tetreault, but a late rally got Princeton within two with less than a minute remaining. Thanks to some defensive stops in the final seconds, the Crimson maintained its lead when the final buzzer sounded.
While six different Crimson players finished with scores, it was Harvard’s defense that proved most impressive, as the unit forced 13 turnovers and held the Tigers to its fifth-lowest offensive output of the season.
“[The defense] played together today,” Crimson coach Lisa Miller said. “The defense took some balls away in midfield transition. We didn’t give [Princeton] what they like to do. We took away their running game, and I thought that was huge, the way the attack re-defended.”
When the Tigers did get shots off, senior goalkeeper Katherine Martino displayed her versatility in net, finishing with seven saves—including several crucial stops early on.
“She played awesome,” Baskind said. “Stepping up in big games, that’s what you want.”
While Harvard had to preserve its lead for most of the contest, it had to come from behind in the early going.
Princeton jumped out to an early 1-0 lead thanks to a score from Kristin Morrison off a free-position shot less than three minutes into the contest.
Baskind knotted the score at one just 50 seconds later, capitalizing off a free-position shot of her own.
After Tigers goalie Erin Tochihara denied two solid shot attempts, freshman Nina Kucharczyk got a ball past the stingy netminder to break the tie. Kucharczyk, who recently moved to attack, looked comfortable in her new position, breaking away from her defender and shooting low for her third-career score.
But Princeton’s Jenna Davis halted the Crimson run.
Davis cut up the middle, received a pass from Maisie Devine, and finished with the goal to tie the score at two with 18:51 left.
The Tigers looked to have momentum back on their side, winning possession just minutes later. But just as Princeton started to get going, Harvard’s defense stepped up.
Co-captain Delia Pais stepped in front of a Tigers attacker, coming away with the interception. Pais ran the ball up the field, where the Crimson offense set up and got the ball in the stick of VanderMeulen, the team’s leading scorer.
VanderMeulen broke down her defender, blowing past her and firing a shot over Tochihara to give her team the 3-2 lead.
“I think we did the small things right, at least for the majority of the game,” Baskind said. “And when we didn’t, we quickly fixed our mistakes rather than [building] on them, which has been an issue in the past.”
Freshman Micaela Cyr kept the momentum going, cutting up the middle and finishing an unassisted goal.
The Crimson’s lead grew from there, as Baskind and VanderMeulen added a tally apiece to extend their team’s lead to four, 6-2.
Princeton cut away at its deficit before the half ended, as Devine capitalized off a Harvard turnover to net her first of two scores.
After the break, the Crimson jumped out of the gates quickly, going on a 4-2 run to take a 10-5 lead.
But Princeton did not let Harvard escape so easily.
With 10:09 left, Devine fed Caroline Rehfuss in front of the goal for the Tigers’ sixth goal. Minutes later, Morrison added another score, cutting the deficit to three.
After Cyr added an insurance goal for the home team, the Tigers got two scores in 35 seconds to get within two with 44 ticks on the clock.
On the ensuing draw control, Princeton won possession, but Harvard’s defense forced a turnover. Baskind took the possession and ran out the clock to seal the victory—the Crimson’s first over the Tigers since 1992.
In the stands to watch the historic win was Harvard’s 1990 NCAA championship squad. As part of the celebration of the 20-year anniversary of the national title, banners commemorating the Crimson’s Ivy titles and NCAA tournament appearances were hung in Harvard Stadium.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A day of rain gave the Harvard softball team (16-19, 7-3 Ivy) some respite on Saturday, but not even a little drizzle could have stopped Senior Day from taking place yesterday.
The team hosted division rival Brown (15-16, 3-7) at Soldiers Field and honored its six seniors—co-captains Melissa Schellberg and Margaux Black, Jennifer Francis, Stephanie Krysiak, Jessica Pledger, and Dana Roberts—before the doubleheader.
“I think this class is a very special class,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said. “They have done a lot for every single team during their four years and especially this one. Just serving the program, in general, I think they’ve left the program better than they found it.”
The Crimson failed to flex its offensive muscle during the first game against the Bears, dropping a 1-0 pitcher’s duel to the division’s bottom-dweller, but finally got it going in the second game.
Harvard scored first in the second inning before Brown tied it up in the third. The score remained even until the Crimson bats came alive in the bottom of the sixth, when freshman Jessica Ferri’s three-RBI double gave Harvard a 4-1 victory.
HARVARD 4, BROWN 1
The Crimson fell flat in the first game, so the squad knew it had to come up with a response for the loss, especially with the excitement of Senior Day on the line.
Harvard started the game inconspicuously, with all three batters being retired on groundouts in the first. But the offense finally kicked into gear in the second, when sophomore Whitney Shaw—who was coming off a home run on Thursday—singled to left field. Shaw was replaced by freshman pinch runner Kassy Shiotani, who swiped second and advanced to third on Francis’ groundout.
Ferri was hit by a pitch and stole second base to put more pressure on Brown pitcher Liz DiMascio.
DiMascio walked Pledger, loading the bases with one out. Shiotani came home on a passed ball, which moved Ferri and Pledger to second and third, but DiMascio got sophomore Jane Alexander to ground into a double play to escape the jam.
The Bears responded in their next at-bat. In the top of the third, with two runners on base, Brown’s Amanda Asay singled up the middle, bringing teammate Stephanie Thompson in for the score.
The game was quiet until the bottom of the sixth, when Krysiak sparked the offense with a single to the shortstop. Schellberg followed up with a walk, and a wild pitch allowed both runners to advance.
Krysiak attempted to steal home but was tagged out, leaving Schellberg—who is also a Crimson sports editor—alone at second base.
Shaw and Francis, who were both walked on 3-1 counts, loaded the bases, giving Ferri an opportunity to break the deadlock. The rookie’s double cleared the bases, giving Harvard a 4-1 lead that would prove insurmountable.
Black came on for her fourth inning of one-hit relief, but it was her defense that put away the game. A groundout to Schellberg at third and a hard catch by Shaw at first ended the day for the Crimson.
“Without my defense behind me, I wouldn’t be doing as well as I’m doing now,” Black said. “Because I’m a ground-ball pitcher, I get a lot of balls hit on the ground, so my defense is making incredible plays behind me.”
BROWN 1, HARVARD 0
Harvard sophomore Rachel Brown and the Bears’ Kristie Chin—two of the top pitchers in the Ivy League—made sure the first game was a quiet one at the plate. Neither team recorded a hit until the fourth inning, when Brown’s Thompson got to first on a single.
“We failed at adjusting to the first pitcher, adjusting to her speed,” Allard said. “We didn’t get a runner on third base the whole game. Two hits. It wasn’t like she was overpowering, but she just was offspeed, and she would spin the ball. She was very effective and did a very good job against us.”
By the time the seventh inning came around, the Bears had four hits, while the Crimson could only come up with two. None of that mattered, since Brown finally strung some hits together to score the only run of the game.
Asay’s single, a steal by pinch runner Danielle Comissiong, and another single, this time from Sandra Mastrangelo, were enough to bring Comissiong around the bases.
Harvard couldn’t respond in the bottom of the inning, causing the team to lose its third straight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team ended its season with two disappointing home losses last weekend against division rivals Sacred Heart University and New Jersey Institute of Technology at the Malkin Athletic Center. The Crimson (5-16, 3-5 EIVA Hay Division) played every match down to the wire, stretching the Pioneers (18-10, 5-3 Hay) to five sets and taking the Highlanders (3-18, 2-6 Hay) to four sets.
But despite the players’ tremendous efforts, Harvard could not pull through, and the two losses ended any playoff hopes for the Crimson.
“It was a hard-fought season,” Co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “In the end, it didn’t go our way.”
NJIT 3, HARVARD 1
In its final match of the season, Harvard lost to NJIT, 3-1 (25-30, 30-17, 32-30, 34-32). Although the Crimson dominated the first set, the Highlanders bounced back, taking three straight sets to win the match.
“It was a disappointing way to end the season,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We couldn’t come back after last night’s loss.”
Harvard built up a three-point lead late into the first set with consecutive blocks that fired up the players and fans. With momentum on its side, the Crimson would finish the first set, 30-25.
NJIT came out in the second set a completely different team. Due to a slew of Harvard errors, the Highlanders racked up a 12-point lead, and they never looked back, winning the set, 30-17.
The third set saw Harvard take an early 15-11 lead. Yet, NJIT bounced back to tie the set at 30. Coming out of a timeout, the Highlanders scored two consecutive points to take the back-and-forth set.
Harvard appeared undeterred at the start of the fourth game, quickly building a six-point lead. But once again, the Crimson gave up the advantage late into the game, and concluded the season on a sour note, losing, 34-32.
The loss marked the final match for several seniors, including co-captain Erik Kuld, Weintraub, Soren Rosier, and Nicholas Manzo.
“It’s sad to end like this,” Weintraub said, “but it has been a great four years, and I look back on it with great memories.”
SACRED HEART 3, HARVARD 2
The Crimson dropped a five-set thriller to Sacred Heart, 3-2 (30-23, 31-33, 32-30, 26-30, 15-13), last Friday despite strong performances from sophomore Matt Jones and Kuld, who recorded 26 and 19 kills, respectively. Harvard led by one down the stretch of the fifth set before the Pioneers rallied for three consecutive points, including a game-winning block that sealed the match.
“I thought our team played well and hit hard,” Baise said. “I have nothing but good things to say.”
The Crimson started off the match out of sync both defensively and in the service game, and Sacred Heart took advantage with consecutive kills, accumulating a late game-lead at 28-23. Harvard was missing coverage for its blockers, and the Pioneers were able to win several momentum-stopping points with well placed kills. In addition, service errors plagued the Crimson, making the team give up hard-earned possessions.
Harvard fought back in the second set, stepping up its defense and keeping the score close until the final moments. With the scored tied at 31, Sacred Heart committed a crucial service error, and Kuld capped off the Crimson comeback with a well-placed tip to take the set 33-31.
Havard carried its momentum to the third set, pulling ahead, 30-29, in the closing minutes. But the Pioneers recovered with three straight points to take the set, making the score 2-1, and putting pressure on the Crimson to force a fifth set.
“In the third set,” Baise said, “we gave them a little bit of room and they took it.”
But Harvard would use a five-point run to take the fourth. With the scored tied at 13 in the fifth, the Crimson committed a game changing double-touch penalty and Sacred Heart capitalized on its lead with a decisive block to end the match.
“It’s hard to fight back [being down sets],” Baise said, “but I think [our efforts] are indicative of this team at the end of the season.”
Harvard played catch up the entire match, but the players never lost focus and intensity. Kuld exemplified this effort by sprinting out of bounds to save two balls, once diving on the floor and once slamming into the wall.
“It’s incredible,” said Baise about Kuld’s diving save. “That kid does not stop until the ball hits the floor.”
This defeat took the Crimson out of the playoff race, giving the Pioneers sole possession of second place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, the “Harvard Speaks” campaign has surfaced a desire for the College to focus on educating its students in the art of public speaking. Because this skill is an essential component of success, regardless of one’s future profession, we hope that Harvard responds by increasing opportunities to acquire it, both in and out of the classroom.
The “Harvard Speaks” petition and the recent demand for classes that offer instruction in public speaking demonstrate that the student body values this skill. This semester’s Expos 40, “Public Speaking Practicum,” garnered 104 applications for only 12 slots. It seems clear that more Harvard students want to learn the rhetorical craft than Expos 40 and a select number of other related courses can accommodate. Considering the demonstrated and professed interest in oratory instruction, Harvard should expand the number of courses that feature public speaking components. Those that already do—like Culture and Belief 11, “Medicine and the Body in East Asia and in Europe,” and English 156, “Crime and Horror in Victorian Literature and Culture,” which now feature presentation components—should publicize this aspect of their curriculum.
In addition to creating new classes that focus on public speaking, Harvard should look to the Bureau of Study Counsel, which could offer an alternative approach to developing this important skill. Students may not have the time or room in their schedules to devote a semester-long class to public speaking. Therefore, evening workshops or a seminar structured similarly to the BSC’s reading course may prove successful at reaching more students.
While we hope that Harvard will be able to expand classes related to public speaking and create new ones in the future, the current financial situation may inhibit this course of action at present. In the meantime, students can explore extracurricular activities already in existence, such as Harvard Model United Nations and The Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society,  that provide public-speaking instruction to members and a forum where they can practice.
Student groups that do strengthen and foster rhetorical eloquence should emphasize this aspect of their clubs, aiming to reach students early in their Harvard careers. Even if these undergraduates have little experience, the opportunity to observe and receive mentorship from polished leaders can transform new members into eloquent speakers.
Despite these suggestions, we commend Harvard College for the steps it has already taken to improve public speaking opportunities on campus. The Harvard College Speaking Tutors, which recently expanded its staff, trains students who have taken Expos 40 as oral presentation and speech coaches. Additionally, the recently created Program in Speaking and Learning is working with faculty to add more public speaking elements to the curriculum at Harvard.
We appreciate the measures put forth so far by the College to demonstrate dedication to public speaking, and hope that the opportunities to refine rhetorical skills continue to expand. Since the ability to speak in public is necessary for students at Harvard, meeting this need will require a multi-faceted approach—including the continued efforts of  the University, extracurricular groups, and the student body.

Much has been made of Martin Kramer’s suggestion that Palestinians be denied food and medicine in order to weaken their opposition to the Israeli occupation. We, along with a group of 25 other professors, scholars, and Harvard alumni, add our voices to the chorus of condemnation directed towards Dr. Kramer and express our concern that the Weatherhead Center has lent him its credibility. As academics, we question both the ethical and scholarly basis of Dr. Kramer’s public statements. We maintain that this is not a question of protecting Dr. Kramer’s free speech, as was indicated by the Weatherhead Center’s response to criticism. Rather, it is about maintaining appropriate standards of ethical and intellectual conduct; Dr. Kramer’s repellent statements evince a clear failure to meet those standards.
The speech in question was made at the 10th annual Herzliya conference, the single most important gathering of influential policymakers and commentators in Israel. Kramer’s talk was part of a panel held on Feb. 3, 2010 entitled “Rising to the Challenge of Radical Indoctrination;” his Harvard affiliation was clearly identified in the conference program in connection with the talk. In Kramer’s presentation, he suggested that Israel’s current economic blockade of Gaza, now in its fourth year, represents a successful effort to “break Gaza’s runaway population growth.” He therefore argued against what he called “pro-natal subsidies” of food, medicine, and humanitarian aid that help to reproduce the “constant supply of superfluous young men” demanded by a so-called “culture of martyrdom” in Gaza.
His argument has little scholarly merit. In the name of state security, it validates demographic strategies of population control that date at least back to Thomas Malthus and have been repeatedly found wanting both intellectually and morally for over two centuries. Also, by attributing to culture what is a political and social phenomenon, Kramer misrepresents the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. A willingness to sacrifice oneself is not a desire for martyrdom rooted in Palestinian culture. Rather, as has been shown by scholars of the conflict, Palestinian youth turn to violent means to oppose the dehumanizing effects of the Israeli occupation. In short, Kramer’s remarks are not informed by current scholarship, but are animated by the spirit of early 20th century eugenics.
Even if the Weatherhead Center were to overlook these scholarly shortcomings, it should at least consider the ethics of Kramer’s interventions. His characterization of young Palestinians as a superfluous population culturally predisposed to violence can only be described as racist. Indeed, his statements are rooted in a polemic that would have been unacceptable in reference to any other population. To quote Weatherhead Center executive committee member Stephen Walt, “What if a prominent academic at Harvard declared that the United States had to make food scarcer for Hispanics so that they would have fewer children? Or what if someone at a prominent think tank noted that black Americans have higher crime rates than some other groups, and therefore it made good sense to put an end to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and other welfare programs, because that would discourage African-Americans from reproducing and thus constitute an effective anti-crime program?” And, finally, what if a similar argument was made with regard to the Jewish people? If the Weatherhead Center would distance itself from such arguments and likely condemn them, why does it defend Kramer when he calls, in effect, for a policy of eugenics against Palestinians?
As Harvard faculty, alumni, and affiliates, we deplore Dr. Kramer’s statements as morally reprehensible and intellectually indefensible. Furthermore, we encourage the Weatherhead Center to reexamine its procedures for evaluating the scholarly credibility of future affiliates.

Facebook used to be just that, an online “book” where you could display non-literal representations of your visage, along with other manifestations of your “face.” The “friends” box demonstrated how popular you were, the “personal info” box displayed your excellent taste in music, and your numerous photo albums informed others of just how much fun you were having. Facebook was special because it allowed people to keep in touch over long distances in a way that was never really possible before—the wealth of constantly updated personal information made it easy to feel like you were getting face time with friends and acquaintances all over the country and the globe.
But as of late, Facebook has become more of a tool for mass publicity than for personal expression and social interaction.
No longer are Facebook pages limited to people and their pets. In the age of new media, it seems like every organization, both for-profit and not-for-profit, has a Facebook page. I once had the strange experience of watching a very dramatic and operatic commercial for the U.S. Marine Corps and afterwards being encouraged to visit them at facebook.com. It was a jarring experience.
But it isn’t just big organizations that solicit Facebook support; my inbox is full of suggestions for me to become a fan of this and that—from my friends themselves. Friends have asked me to become fans of the company they work for, or the cause they support, or the publication they write for. I’ve even had at least two friends request that I become fans of them (to be fair, one is a fashion designer and the other is a musician). Though I am sure these individuals have only the best intentions, I can’t help but feel that it’s rather odd to ask someone to declare herself a fan of something that she probably couldn’t care less about on a personal level. And the worst offenders are often the friends that could only be defined as friends on Facebook.
These “friends” don’t know me well enough to write on my wall, but they don’t have any qualms about pressing their interests onto me. There is something deeply depersonalizing about the fact that people can look at their social networks as potential marketing tools in this way. Somehow, I feel that the people-to-people connection that makes Facebook so special gets lost in the shuffle—when I get asked, along with a hundred other people, to become a friend of HUDS or an entire a capella group. I’m sorry, but my Facebook is not an advertising space for all the things that my “friends” do.
Although this development is fairly innocuous in itself, it seems to indicate a negative trend in the way we view our relationships with other people. It has become increasingly acceptable for individuals to use friends as publicity vehicles. Many employers appear to even encourage this type of behavior; more than a few jobs that I looked at for this summer indicated that familiarity with use of social networks was a plus. However, when there are already specifically business-oriented networking sites like LinkedIn, Plaxo, and Xing, the mixing of business and personal relationships on Facebook is entirely unnecessary and detrimental to the site’s purpose.
Perhaps this is merely the march of progress and my lamentation will go down as a typically shortsighted protest against change, akin to doomsday predictions about the Internet, Twitter, or texting. But just wait ’til the day when you open up your Facebook to see that you are a fan of Jim’s T-shirt Company and a member of the group Nominate Me for City Council Member of (insert small town here), and you might just realize that the “face” presented by that page isn’t yours.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every day, Harvard Square moves a little closer to Leicester Square in London and Huacaypata in Cusco. Of course, the earth is not shrinking. The natural features of the earth do not dramatically change—our expectations of transportation do. This past week, the earth has reminded us of our own limits through a volcano that has spelled even with its name: Eyjafjallajokull.
Iceland, geographically an isolated island, has become a symbol of the interdependence of the global community, both in the good and in the bad. When the financial crisis struck economies across the globe, the collapse of Iceland’s banks exacerbated the problem. In its aftermath, The Wall Street Journal has reported that investment from foreign banks in Iceland’s banking system severely worsened the damage.
More recently, Iceland has advertised itself as a launch point for trans-Atlantic travel. Advertisements in subways, magazines, and television encouraged travelers to look to the island as a boon to cheapen and improve their air travel.
Enter Eyjafjallajokull.
The volcano has stranded thousands of travelers each day since last Thursday. Simply put, there has never been a sudden stop in travel like this before. Heathrow, the world’s busiest airport, halts activity periodically because of snow or even human reasons, from a terrorism scare to a botched terminal opening. When Heathrow cannot operate, it becomes more difficult to travel through Europe or connect to destinations across the Atlantic. This weekend, however, every airport in Europe was shut down. Ash high in the atmosphere has halted flights to and from cities as far from Iceland as Madrid and Tel Aviv.
The ash is undiscriminating in its reach, grounding the world’s celebrities and dignitaries. We humans like to move around—and we have never moved around as much as today. It is now feasible for students at Oxford to attend a birthday party in New York City and be home for the week. As just one example of our expectations of mobility, take one such group that ventured across the Atlantic for a gathering four days ago. Flying the day before the volcano, the group made it to New York in just a few hours and expected only a bit of sleep trouble as the cost. On Saturday, however, simply mentioning Iceland in conversation drew curses and nervous looks.
Quick transit from anywhere in the world back to our homes has become more than a mercurial possibility in the modern outlook. We are used to finding any information, on any topic, via a quick Google search. We can hold up our phones to a strange song and find out instantly the name of its obscure band, or speak with people anywhere at any time.
Every aspect of society assumes quick transportation. The Boston Marathon today must proceed without one of the sport’s most high-profile figures—Abdellah Falil. The Moroccan Olympian and star can no longer cross the Atlantic, and so he will not be crossing the finish line. Athletes in major sports events across the globe are now stranded.
The inability to fly is a great equalizer reaching every tier of society. John Cleese has increased his fame by paying over five thousand dollars for a 930 mile cab ride from Oslo to Brussels, a fifteen hour trip. President Obama has had to cancel his trip to pay respects to the victims of the recent air tragedy that claimed many of Poland’s political and social leaders.
Beyond simply transporting ourselves from one location to another, we depend on air transit for so much more. The airline industries are losing two hundred million dollars each day, but we will not know the economic impact of Eyjafjallajokull until long after airports have returned to normal. Only the residents of neighborhoods near the world’s busy runways will enjoy the silence in the skies.
The BBC asked philosopher Alain de Botton to imagine “a world without planes” inspired by the current transit crisis. His proposed future, with man returning to pre-modern forms of travel, deserves reading. The scenario, however, is unlikely to become reality any time soon. If anything, some volcanic ash has revealed just how integral air travel has become. Our politics, economies, and even entertainment rely on materials and people taking to the air. Even as technology makes it easier for us to communicate and transfer information at long distances, we depend on the ability to move ourselves.
When the ash has settled, we can reflect on the philosophical implications of dependence on air transit. For now, at least, the ash reminds us that our connected world just cannot function the same without it.

The Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s chances to earn its first postseason berth since 2006 took a serious blow Saturday when Ivy League bottom-dweller Penn (5-7, 1-4 Ivy) upset the No. 15 Crimson (5-5, 1-3), 12-7, at Franklin Field.
“I thought we made a lot of the same mistakes [we usually do],” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “We tried to make some adjustments, we tried to change some things defensively, and it ultimately came down to turnovers. When you give a team like Penn that many extra opportunities, they will make you pay.”
Senior midfielder Jason Duboe scored a season-high three goals in the first half, but the Crimson could not pull away in the opening quarters.
“I just took what they gave me,” Duboe said. “I guess I’ve been struggling all year with shooting, and it was just nice to have a couple fall.”
Harvard got on the scoreboard first for the first time since Mar. 20 against Brown when Duboe tallied his seventh goal of the season just over four minutes into the game.
Penn’s Al Kohart and Duboe would have a scoring duel for the rest of the quarter. Kohort tied the game at 7:45 only to have Duboe give the lead right back to the Crimson one minute later with his second unassisted goal of the afternoon. After freshman defenseman Jeff Molinari gave the Quakers a man advantage with 1:09 left in the quarter, Kohort responded to Duboe with his second goal of the game to tie the score at two at the end of the first.
Penn’s John Conneely gave the Quakers their first lead of the game at the 13:24 mark of the second quarter, but Harvard and Penn would again trade goals en route to a 4-4 halftime score.
The Quakers wouldn’t allow any trading in the third quarter, as Penn outscored the Crimson, 5-0, in the frame to deflate Harvard and take a 9-4 lead into the final 15 minutes. The Quakers outshot the Crimson, 42-27, overall, but Harvard actually had its most shots—10—in the third frame.
“We didn’t execute, and as a whole, we were really sloppy on offense,” Duboe said. “We deviated from the game plan...we were fully prepared, we just didn’t execute.”
Junior Dean Gibbons and freshman Peter Schwartz scored the first two goals of the fourth quarter to close the deficit to 9-6 with 10:42 left in the game, but the Quakers’ Tim Schwalje put an end to the Crimson’s brief dash of momentum with his third goal of the season to extend the lead to 10-6. Gibbons’s second goal with 6:41 to play closed the gap to 10-7 and put the game within reach for Harvard, but Penn would shut out the Crimson for the remainder of the game and add two insurance goals in the final three minutes to ice the 12-7 victory.
Harvard has been outshot in each game during its current three-game losing streak. Freshman goalkeeper Harry Krieger recorded 10 saves for his third straight double-digit save performance, but a combination of 42 Penn shots and only seven goals of support prevented Krieger from earning his fourth win of the season.
With only two regular-season games left before the Ivy League tournament, the Crimson most likely needs to run the table if it hopes to make the inaugural tournament.
This is the first year in which the Ivy League is using a postseason conference tournament to determine the automatic qualifiers to the NCAA tournament. The top four teams in the regular season standings will make the postseason bracket.
Currently, Harvard stands tied for fifth in the standings with Dartmouth (1-3 Ivy). If Brown (2-2) wins at least one of its two remaining conference games against Cornell (3-1) or Dartmouth, Harvard must win its final two games against Princeton (4-0) and at Yale (3-2) to have a chance at clinching a spot in the Ivy League tournament.
“We’re going to look at every game as an important game from here on out,” Tillman said. “Obviously we’re a young team, and we’ve gotten younger as the year’s gone on in some ways, but our goal is that we are growing and learning from these mistakes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday morning, beneath threatening, dark skies, two ancient foes met for battle in the icy chop of the Charles River Basin. The coxswains’ cries for pressure and precision were audible despite the howling tailwind. And cheers for respective crews echoed from the Mass. Ave Bridge to the battlefield below. But, midway through combat, a piercing crack of hull against hull rattled the air and left one brigade of oarsmen sinking to the icy depths while the other advanced victorious.
Even though the scene certainly resembled a clash between naval fleets, it was in actuality the 74th annual Compton Cup—a meeting of old rivals, the No. 4 Harvard men’s heavyweight crew, the No. 7 Princeton Tigers, and the MIT Engineers.
In the varsity race, Princeton held the Crimson to only a three- or four-seat advantage through the 1000-meter mark. Harvard moved another three or four seats on the Tigers as the crews passed beneath the Mass. Ave Bridge, pushing their bow ball out almost a full length.
Coming out of the bridge, Princeton’s steering cable unexpectedly snapped, jamming the rudder to starboard and causing the coxswain to lose his point. The Tigers veered sharply into Harvard’s lane, smashing the bow of their boat into the Crimson’s stern.
“There was a bit of shouting going, because we didn’t really realize what had happened,” said sophomore varsity stroke Pat Lapage.
The last few feet of Princeton’s bow deck broke off in the collision and the boat began to fill with water. The crew was forced to stop rowing altogether, and became an obstacle around which the trailing MIT crew had to swerve.
“MIT was really a good distance off, so we didn’t have to worry about them or Princeton coming back on us,” Lapage said. “So, we just focused on rowing well the rest of the race.”
Harvard continued on its course, the hull structurally unaffected by the blow. The varsity won the Compton Cup in a time of 5:53.01. The Engineers followed in 6:19.08, and the Tigers did not finish.
The Crimson followed with a sweep of Princeton and MIT across the board. In each race, the Tigers pushed Harvard in the first 1000 meters, but the Crimson oarsmen remained composed and made moves into the second 1000 meters that silenced their opponents.
“In general, Princeton went out fast in the first part,” Lapage said. “But then we really rowed them down in the rough water, having had a lot of experience practicing in that.”
The second varsity won in a time of 5:53.59 to Princeton’s 5:55.13. Harvard’s third varsity finished in 5:54.42, four seconds ahead of the Tigers’ time of 5:58.68 and just over 15 seconds ahead of the fourth varsity’s time of 6:10.00.
Finally, the Crimson freshman eight maintained its perfect record in dual racing, edging out Princeton by roughly a length, in a time of 5:49.31.
NO. 2 LIGHTWEIGHTS VS. NO. 10 DARTMOUTH/NO. 11 MIT
The No. 2 Harvard men’s lightweight team also faced harsh racing conditions this weekend on the road in Hanover, N.H. On Saturday morning, the Crimson swept its competition, the No. 10 Dartmouth Big Green and the No. 11 MIT Engineers, in sub-freezing temperatures on the Connecticut River.
Harvard’s varsity maintained its unblemished record and captured the team’s 47th Biglin Bowl in the competition’s 56-year history.
The first varsity clocked a time of 5:47.0, beating the Big Green and the Engineers, who finished in 5:50.7 and 5:57.4, respectively.
The conditions were less than ideal for the Crimson, but the oarsmen relied on their fitness and race plan.
“It was kind of cold and we weren’t as warmed up as we maybe would have liked,” said sophomore varsity stroke Tim Moore. “But we still did what we had to do and stuck to our race plan, so even though the margin was a bit less than expected, the win is definitely not a disappointment.”
The second varsity eight distanced itself slightly more from its competition, finishing nearly eight seconds ahead of Dartmouth with a time of 5:57.9. MIT did not field a second or third varsity eight, but Harvard’s third varsity joined the second varsity crews and finished third in 6:11.2.
The Crimson novice crews continued to dominate their opposition this weekend. The first novice boat won by just over 11 seconds with a time of 5:56.0. In the second novice eight race, Harvard secured the largest margin of victory on the day, finishing 14.3 seconds ahead of the Big Green, in a time of 6:13.9.
“It was good to see every boat win their respective race, especially in those conditions that were a bit of a shock to the system,” captain Martin Eiermann said. “We are trying to keep these races as one step towards the coming races and the championships. It’s all part of a process. And, [this race] was sort of one box that we can check off on a list of what we have to do from now into the coming weeks as part of the larger context.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Had the Harvard baseball team managed to take home at least one weekend victory, it would have given itself a shot at tying Brown for first place in the Rolfe Divison. But yesterday was a day for the status quo, as the Bears (11-20, 8-2 Ivy League) took both games, 7-1 and 10-3, in the first of two doubleheaders at O’Donnell Field. The next slate of games will take place today.
“Obviously, we didn’t play well enough to win either game,” Crimson coach Joe Walsh said.
BROWN 7, HARVARD 1
The team with the Ivy’s worst ERA didn’t look so bad against the Crimson (11-20, 4-6), shutting out the hosts until the penultimate inning.
“Pitching-wise, I thought we did very well,” Bears coach Marek Drabinski said. “I thought our second starter, Will Weidig, pitched very well.”
Weidig silenced Harvard batters early, allowing only one hit—a Jeff Reynolds single—in the first four innings.
Though the senior registered just one strikeout in that span, his teammates were able to catch or throw out any potential threat.
“I thought our first baseman [Cody Slaughter] was spectacular with the plays he made,” Drabinski said.
A walk for sophomore Marcus Way in the second inning marked the only other time a Harvard player reached base in those first four.
“In tough conditions they played well defensively,” Walsh said. “Usually the weather can be a factor, but it wasn’t for them. I was impressed by their defense.”
Harvard’s futile at-bats allowed Weidig to outduel sophomore Conner Hulse, who allowed four runs—three earned—in 6.1 innings on the mound.
“Conner went out there and battled all day,” Walsh said. “We haven’t scored too many runs for him...which is disappointing.”
But thanks to Hulse’s pitching and the Crimson defense’s solid, if not spectacular, performance, Harvard found itself down by only three runs in the sixth inning. With junior shortstop Sean O’Hara on base and Albright at the plate with two outs, the Crimson seemed to have a chance to change its fate.
Perhaps looking to take fate into his own hands, O’Hara, who had just walked for his third time of the day, went for the steal. But when the Bears were able to make the play, Albright was left at home plate, where he would soon reappear in catcher’s gear.
One inning and two runs later, the junior captain got another chance on offense.
This time, Albright was not left with the bat on his shoulder, notching a base hit to center field. When sophomore Marcus Way followed with a single of his own and junior Sam Franklin was hit by a pitch, Harvard found itself with the bases loaded and just one out.
Junior Andrew Bakowski then walked junior Dillon O’Neill, sending Albright home to put the Crimson on the board. But Backowski quickly silenced the rally, striking out freshman Dan Moskovitz and senior Chris Rouches.
“A key moment in the second game was bases loaded [in the seventh inning]...and to limit them to one run I thought was huge,” Drabinski said.
From then on, the Bears rolled through two easy innings, putting two more runs on the board in the top of the ninth before heading to the bus with a record two games better. The squad returns to Cambridge tomorrow to complete the four-game set.
BROWN 10, HARVARD 3
Rain is the enemy of any baseball fan, but for the Crimson, a rain delay in the middle of the fourth inning allowed it the chance to regroup and get runs on the board.
Early in the day’s first contest, it seemed to be a duel on the mound, as both Harvard junior Eric Eadington and the Bears’ freshman pitcher Kyle Carlow were silencing their opposing batters, opening the game with two scoreless innings.
But Eadington started to hurt in the third inning, leading to an injury timeout. The pitcher struggled to regain his form, yielding three Brown runs in the frame.
After the Crimson was unable to respond in the bottom of the inning, the Bears put one more on the board in the top of the fourth to take a commanding 4-0 lead.
And then the rain came, forcing Harvard to cover up the pitching mound and fans of both teams to head for cover.
When the weather cleared up enough to allow play to resume, a different Crimson offense stepped up to the plate.
O’Hara, who walked in the first inning, got one of his few chances all day to use his bat. The shortstop didn’t waste it, sending the ball deep into center field for a triple.
Way was next on base—walking after reaching a full count—before Albright sent O’Hara home on a double to right field. Franklin grounded out to first on the next play, but he gave Way enough time to reach home.
And then it was Albright’s turn to score his first of two runs on the day. The catcher took advantage of a wild pitch, racing home before his Brown counterpart had a chance to turn around and tag him.
But when Rouches struck out swinging, the Bears headed back to the plate and wasted little time neutralizing Harvard’s hitting with a three-run inning of their own.
This time, the Crimson wasn’t able to respond, as Brown allowed no runs for the rest of the game and put up another three-run inning in the seventh.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the Ivy League Championships looming next weekend, the Harvard men’s golf team traveled to Owings Mills, Md., to participate in the Caves Valley Invitational.
High winds brought high scores, especially on Saturday, as Brown, Cornell, George Washington, Penn, Princeton, Yale, and the Crimson battled the elements.
Despite wild scores, Harvard battled its way into a third-place tie, shooting a 622 over the course of the tournament. Penn took the title by tallying 612 strokes, Princeton came in second at 617, and George Washington matched the Crimson’s score for third.
“None of us really had it today,” sophomore Tony Grillo said. “We all felt we didn’t play well this week, and I think it’s something to look forward to next week.”
The wind presented the largest challenge for the players. On the first day when conditions were harshest, only 13 players carded less than an 80.
“I’d say it was probably gusting up near 30 miles per hour and stayed right around 20 to 25, so we didn’t play great,” Grillo said.
“We pride ourselves on struggling through the tough conditions,” sophomore Mark Pollak said. “We all felt we didn’t accomplish that this weekend.”
“Yes, it’s easy to say the weather was horrible,” he added, “but to perform when the weather is really horrible is a sign that you’re doing well, and the fact that we didn’t do that this weekend is discouraging.”
The tournament was hosted by a red-hot Bulldog squad that had won its last two matches, including last week’s Princeton Invitational, where it edged Harvard on a tiebreaker. This time around, Yale dropped to fifth place where, along with the Big Red, it scored a 625.
In last week’s Princeton Invitational, senior Greg Shuman and Pollak set the pace for the Crimson, by shooting a 215 and 218, respectively. But this week, the duo could not replicate its success.
“This tournament, we did something that I don’t believe we’ve done all season,” Grillo said. “We were forced to drop one score from our top two players in each round, which, given how we’ve been [performing] all season, is the opposite of how we’ve been playing,”
Grillo led Harvard in the tournament. The sophomore shot a 79 on Saturday and a 76 on Sunday—good enough for a 155 and ninth place overall in the tournament.
“I felt like I played pretty good golf, but I got caught off guard each day,” Grillo said. “I had a high number in the middle of [each] round...It will definitely help me going into next week, help me manage my game a little better.”
The Caves Valley Golf Club, built in 1991, is a par-71 course that stretches 6,942 yards. Designed by famed golf course architect Tom Fazio, Caves Valley’s biggest challenge was the speed of its greens.
“They were the fastest I’ve played in college without a doubt,” Pollak said. “It’s hard to control the ball when you’re on the green, and that’s usually where you make up your strokes.”
Last year, Harvard dominated the tournament. Pollak came in fourth overall and Shuman finished just behind him in sixth as the Crimson cruised and won by 13 strokes.
Although Harvard could not match last year’s result, its finish constitutes the Crimson’s third-straight top-three performance. Going into the final event of the season—this weekend’s Ivy League Championship at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J.—Harvard’s consistency bodes well.
“If these last tournaments are evidence of anything, it’s that the championship is up there for anyone to grab,” Pollak said. “We’ve had teams go from last to first and vice versa, so it’s really all going to come down to the three games next week.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a cold and rainy afternoon, the Harvard men’s and women’s track and field teams put in strong performances on Saturday in New Haven, Conn. While the men’s squad came up just short of the Bulldogs for the eighth year in a row, the Crimson women soundly defeated Yale.
The men suffered a slight stumble on their way to the upcoming Penn Relays and Heptagonal Championships, falling by a score of 86-77, while the women cruised to a 24-point victory, defending their title from last year, 93-69.
“The women competed hard, and it was great for them to come away with the win,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “It was great for the women to beat their rivals. Even though the men didn’t win, they put in a strong performance and significantly closed the gap. Last year, we probably lost by about 50 points, but this year it was only single digits.”
Despite the Crimson men’s eighth consecutive loss to the Bulldogs, the squad improved from past years with some strong showings on the weekend. Co-captain Jack Brady continued his dominance in the men’s shot put, taking first with a distance of 16.56 meters. Sophomore Brian Paison took first in the 800-meter run with a time of 1:50.58, and sophomore Steven Geloneck pulled off a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash, earning five and three points, respectively, for Harvard.
“We just had more depth and talent this year, and we were looking to utilize it,” co-captain Justin Grinstead said. “But it just wasn’t enough to pull off the win.”
The 5,000-meter run proved to be a successful performance for the Crimson, as senior Chas Gillespie and freshman Phil Galebach claimed the top two spots by a difference of 0.25 seconds. Yale’s Jake McKenzie slipped into the third position, while Harvard sophomores Michael Hoffman and Dan Stiles tied for fourth place in 15:08.39.
Grinstead and sophomore Robbie Paris took first and third, respectively, in the 400-meter hurdles. Grinstead edged out Yale’s Ted Galligan by just 0.3 seconds, with a time of 53.59.
“I was happy to take first in the event,” Grinstead said. “It’s still not the time I’m looking for, but it’s a slight improvement on the year and it’s promising.”
The Crimson women started off strong and never looked back as they sailed to a 93-69 win over the Bulldogs. In the shot put, freshman Shannon Watt, sophomore Lauren Barber, and freshman Brianne Holland-Stergar went one, two, three in the event, sweeping all nine points for Harvard.
“I was pleased overall with our performance,” said junior co-captain Thea Lee. “Everyone could’ve done better, but we were happy we defended our title.”
Freshman Ashtynn Baltimore also led her team to victory, earning two first-place finishes in the 100-meter hurdles—with a time of 14.49—and the long jump, with a distance of 5.93 meters. Juniors Lee and Claire Richardson and freshman Carlyle Davis also turned in strong results, with Richardson winning the 3,000-meter run and Davis and Lee taking second and third in the 800-meter run.
“I had a decent performance this weekend,” Lee said. “I wouldn’t say I was satisfied with my performance, but I was happy to advance the team.”
With the Yale meet behind them, the Harvard men’s and women’s track teams look to move forward to the Penn Relays in Philadelphia, Pa. this week and the Heptagonal Championships in Princeton, N.J. starting May 8.
For seniors like Grinstead, this May event is the last chance to put in a big performance.
“There’s going to be a lot of competition at Penn Relays, so we’re looking forward to getting into the mindset for Heps,” Grinstead said. “This is what we’ve been focusing on for the whole season, and we’re looking to finish off strong.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After ending its string of losses against Brown on Wednesday with a 7-6 win, the Harvard women’s water polo team seemed ready to tackle a weekend of tough competition.
But the Crimson (12-12, 1-3 CWPA North) fell to both No. 11 Hartwick (24-4, 4-0) and Brown (19-13, 1-3) to end the regular season and jeopardize its shot at postseason play.
“It was tough,” freshman attack Aisha Price said. “But we know we can do better.”
BROWN 14, HARVARD 10
Yesterday afternoon, Wheaton College played host to a showdown between the Crimson and the Bears.
Plagued by defensive woes, Harvard could not force a repeat of Wednesday’s results.
“The team was fired up,” Crimson coach Erik Farrar said, “but that was our worst individual defensive game of the year.”
The first half of play saw Harvard get off to a shaky start. The team struggled to find the back of the net as many shots hit the posts, while Brown took advantage of several ejections to get ahead early.
“That put a lot of pressure on us,” Farrar said. “It got us in a very deep hole that we ultimately couldn’t climb out of.”
Although the team couldn’t salvage the second half of play to capture a victory, several players put on a strong showing.
“There were a couple of great individual efforts,” Farrar noted. “Aisha had her best game of the year—she had four goals.”
Sophomore two-meter defenseman Ita Barton-Kettleborough also buried three markers in the squad’s loss, while sophomore Devan Kennifer added two.
Sophomore Shannon Purcell scored once in the losing effort.
HARTWICK 11, HARVARD 8
Saturday’s Senior Night at Blodgett Pool had Harvard pumped up, and when freshman center Elise Molnar put one between the pipes after just over a minute of play, it appeared that the Crimson was on the path to victory.
But by the end of the first period, Harvard was down, 4-1, and the gap was ultimately too large to close.
“It was a frustrating loss,” Farrar said. “We were in it, and we had our opportunities to win, but we didn’t shoot very well. We gave up a couple of goals that we shouldn’t have, and that ultimately decided it.
“We had three rock-solid quarters, but unfortunately against Hartwick, you have to play all four well,” Farrar added.
Indeed, the second period was rock-solid as the Crimson matched the Hawks, scoring three goals apiece. Co-captain Kristina Bergquist and sophomore attack Monica Zdrojewski each chipped in a goal, and junior attack Patricia Smith scored on a breakaway in the strong offensive effort.
But Hartwick’s offensive prowess was clear, as the Hawks easily put the ball away with Harvard defenders on their backs.
“We definitely had our chance,” Farrar said. “But there were no surprises. We were outplayed.”
Helping to preserve a perfect 26-0 record against the Crimson, Hartwick’s sophomore center Allyssa Analytis contributed four goals, despite heavy defense against her.
Junior goalkeeper Jessica Dorman also played a large role, with 12 saves on the night.
But despite the disappointing loss, Harvard too managed to put up strong numbers.
Citing sophomore netminder Laurel McCarthy’s 15 saves, Farrar noted that it was “definitely one of Laurel’s better games.”
Bergquist scored once more in the fourth period to give her two goals for the night, while Zdrojewski chipped in two tallies and also captured five steals.
“It was a bummer that we couldn’t win, but overall we played a pretty good game,” Price concluded.
The Crimson improved on last week’s performance against the Hawks, losing by a margin of three goals instead of seven.
“I was pretty pleased with our efforts,” Farrar said. “We did a lot of very good things.”
For Hartwick, Saturday night’s victory was rewarded with the CWPA North Division regular-season title and an automatic bid to the conference championships.
If Harvard hopes to make it to the competition as well, the team must claim one of two at-large bids, which, according to Farrar, the Crimson has a very strong case for.
“Now, we’re training under the assumption that we’ll go to the conference championships,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Confronted with its final test before next week’s Ivy League Championship, the Harvard women’s golf team passed with flying colors.
Both avenging last season’s second-place finish and marking its sixth-consecutive victory, the Crimson shot a two-day total of 603 to take home the top prize in the Roar-EE Invitational, hosted by Columbia University at Spook Rock Golf Course in Suffern, N.Y.
“I’m happy with the team score overall, because we had all the Ivy schools represented there,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “Not that it’s any indication of what will happen next week, but it’s nice to do well in comparison to the other Ivy schools that we’ll be playing against when it matters even more next week. On the team side, I’m not displeased at all with what happened.”
The Crimson nabbed the team title by 10 strokes over Penn, which finished with a 37-over-par 613, while Yale’s 619 was enough for third. Four other Ivy schools—including Princeton, last year’s Roar-EE Invitational winner—rounded out the 14-squad field.
Harvard opened the tournament with a Friday score of 300 on the 6,061-yard, par-72 course, besting the Bulldogs’ efforts by six strokes. The second day of competition proved tougher for the Crimson, which closed things out with a 303.
Crimson junior Mia Kabasakalis led the entire 75-member field, tying Columbia senior Nancy Shon atop the individual leaderboard at 148.
Once again Harvard’s top player in the Roar-EE Invitational, Kabasakalis improved upon last year’s fifth-place overall finish by firing a 72-76.
“My game was a little bit different this weekend than it normally is,” the Alameda, Calif. native said. “I hit more greens than I usually do...[Saturday] I was getting a little frustrated because I had many more putts than normal. I had 36 putts, and then none of them were really dropping...Thankfully, I was striking the ball pretty well, so that made up for it.”
“She had a very good fall, and then her spring, she’s been trying to find it,” Rhoads said of Kabasakalis. “[She’s been] showing signs of where she needs to be, but not quite there yet, so for her to get a good result this week is really, really good and encouraging.”
Not far behind was sophomore teammate Jane Lee, who shook off a rough outing last weekend to take fourth place overall.
After a solid first round of 76, Lee made 12 pars in a row on the way to a second-day 74.
“I just felt really comfortable, and I felt like I could score if I wanted to,” Lee said. “I felt in control of everything, which is a nice feeling to have, because I feel like all my work during the season paid off.”
Lee credited her second-year improvement to a progression in her mental game.
“Last year, I wasn’t really sure if I could keep up with the level of college golf, and I was just really uncertain, and that showed in my games sometimes,” Lee said. “I think this year I’ve realized that the level of my game is good enough to really be competitive...it’s a really good feeling.”
Rounding out the stellar team showing was Crimson team captain Claire Sheldon, who tied for 11th with a final tally of 153. Freshman Chloe Altchek was just one stroke behind in 14th place, and senior Sarah Harvey tied for 15th place at 155.
Standout freshman Katie Sylvan and sophomore Christine Cho—the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year—elected not to travel this weekend in hopes of being better prepared for the multi-day Ancient Eight championship the following week.
But Altchek and Lee were more than capable fill-ins for the pair, as Lee came away with her career-best performance in a multi-day event.
“We have good depth, and we can count on any of our top seven to play in our top five each week,” Rhoads said. “We’ve had some good individual performances, but we’ve also had a solid five-plus people who can put up a score...I’m proud of that. Because golf is such an individual game, it’s easy to get caught up in what you’re doing. Our team really thinks of itself as a team.”
As his squad prepares to string together a third-straight Ivy League title, Rhoads has ensured that his players are in the proper state of mind.
“Even though we try not to think about other teams, it’s nice to know that we’re definitely ready and able to compete at that level where we can win,” Lee said. “This tournament is pretty good in testing how we compete together as a team...It’s reaffirming our belief that we can win, and that if we do everything right, we have a really good chance of winning.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming into Friday’s match against Brown (15-7, 3-2 Ivy) and yesterday’s match at No. 46 Yale (15-6, 4-2), the Harvard women’s tennis team found itself at a critical juncture in its season. With its loss to No. 28 Princeton (20-5, 7-0) last weekend, the squad witnessed an Ivy League title fall out of its control.
But the Crimson knows that if it wants to qualify for the NCAA tournament, it has to consistently deliver top performances for the remainder of the season. Entering the weekend in a four-way tie in the Ivy League standings with Brown, Yale, and Dartmouth (16-4, 3-2), No. 56 Harvard (13-7, 5-1) knew it needed crucial victories against the Bears and Bulldogs to inch closer to an NCAA berth.
And the Crimson got those wins, topping Brown, 5-2, before pulling out a tight 4-3 win over Yale to move into sole possession of second place.
HARVARD 4, YALE 3
Earlier this season at the ECAC Championships, Yale produced a decisive 6-1 win over the Crimson. The two old rivals faced off again yesterday, and this time around, Harvard was a different team with a different outlook. Willing to put the past to rest, the Crimson had just one goal on its mind—a victory that would bridge the gap to a potential NCAA tournament spot.
With a close 4-3 win against Yale at Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center in New Haven, Conn., the squad moved closer to turning those NCAA dreams into reality.
Harvard won the doubles point for its third-consecutive match, polishing a facet of its game that it has frequently struggled with this season. The first doubles duo of sophomore Holly Cao and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans and the second doubles team of freshmen Kristin Norton and Hideko Tachibana each drew 8-3 wins over their opponents.
“We lost to Yale at the ECACs, and that really motivated us,” Cao said. “In doubles, we really stuck together as a team and just kept believing that we could beat Yale.”
In singles, No. 61 Cao fell, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4, to the Bulldogs’ Vicky Brook at No. 1.
But at No. 2, No. 4, and No. 5, the balls bounced the Crimson’s way. Tachibana defeated Stephanie Kent, 7-6 (5), 6-3, at No. 2. Junior Agnes Sibilski charged back at No. 5 after dropping the first set, 6-2, to claim matching 6-3 wins in the second and third sets.
But the pivotal clinching victory appropriately came down to the captain’s court. Despite losing a close tiebreaker in the first set, Rosekrans exemplified both her resiliency and leadership by posting 6-4, 6-3 wins in the second and third sets, respectively.
Harvard’s win dealt Yale’s ambitions of an at-large NCAA tourney bid a major blow. Princeton, on the other hand, has already clinched an automatic NCAA spot and the outright Ivy League title.
“We do have a really good shot [at an NCAA berth],” Rosekrans said. “We hadn’t focused on that too much before in order to not get distracted. But if we end up winning against Dartmouth [on Wednesday], then I think we have a really good chance.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
On Friday afternoon at the Murr Center, Harvard toppled Brown, 5-2.
The Crimson set the tempo of play for the afternoon by securing the doubles point.
After losing at No. 3 doubles, Harvard picked up a win on the second court, where Norton and Tachibana defeated Misia Krasowski and Julie Flazner, 8-2. All eyes then shifted to the top court, where Rosekrans and Cao edged out Bianca Aboubakare and Cassandra Herzberg, 8-6, to clinch the point.
“Doubles was even better than usual,” Crimson sophomore Sam Gridley said. “We saw a lot of energy from our first through our third doubles. Our No. 2 doubles are always on fire, and our first were really clutch today.”
In singles, Cao consistently dictated play from the baseline, handily defeating Aboubakare, 6-2, 6-1, and improving to 8-0 at home this season. At No. 4, Rosekrans was challenged in the first set against Flazner, but came out on top, 6-4. She pulled out a more decisive 6-2 victory in the second set to give Harvard its second singles point.
No. 3 singles witnessed perhaps the most visible turnaround of the entire match. Norton and Krasowski repeatedly exchanged points in a tight 7-5 first set, which ended in Norton’s favor. But the second set was far more one-sided, as Norton powered back to sweep her opponent, 6-0, handing the overall match to the Crimson.
“Kristin’s been competing really well,” Gridley said. “The girl she [played was] deceptively good. Kristin [was] running on the court a lot faster and just getting to balls.”
At No. 5, Sibilski fell to Marisa Schonfeld, 7-6 (2), 6-2. Freshman Alexandra Lehman and Tachibana dropped their singles matches at No. 2 and No. 6, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard men’s tennis team was no longer in the hunt for the Ivy League title, this weekend it settled for the next best thing: taking it away from Yale.
The Crimson (13-10, 4-2 Ivy) had back-to-back victories, defeating Brown (10-14, 0-5) on Friday and the Bulldogs (15-8, 4-2) yesterday.
“We did not want Yale to win [the Ivy League championship] on our home court,” junior Aba Omodele-Lucien said. “We were going to do anything we could to win.”
HARVARD 4, YALE 3
The Crimson finished the weekend with a grueling victory over Yale in the Murr Center.
Harvard started off by capturing the doubles point in what has almost become a routine for the Crimson.
“We came out hot again in doubles,” said Omodele-Lucien, who teamed up with freshman Christo Schultz to win at the No. 1 spot, 8-3. “[The No. 2 team] pulled out some clutch shots as well.”
The No. 2 pairing of sophomore Alistair Felton and freshman Andy Nguyen won by a score of 8-6, while the No. 3 team fell to the Bulldogs, 8-3.
Up 1-0, Harvard moved into singles play. The first to finish was Felton at No. 6, who made quick work of his opponent, 6-1, 6-3.
Schultz followed soon with a 6-2, 6-3 win at No. 4, as Nguyen lost his match, 6-4, 6-4, at No. 5.
“Christo did a great job today at No. 4,” Crimson coach Dave Fish ’77 said. “That was a huge one. And Ali was going right after the jugular [at No. 6].”
That left the top three matches to play, with a 3-1 advantage for Harvard. But Yale was far from quitting, and fought each remaining match into the third set.
After long battles on all three courts, No. 3 Omodele-Lucien’s 6-3 victory in the deciding set broke the stalemate and secured the win for Harvard.
“I started off pretty slow, but I was able to come back and stay stronger than him,” Omodele-Lucien said. “I was just happy that I was able to clinch.”
“Aba really kept himself together today,” Fish added.
Freshman Joshua Tchan and junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans went on to lose at Nos. 2 and 1, respectively. In total, the match lasted over three and a half hours.
“The whole thing just sort of fell our way,” Fish said. “It was a home match, an unbelievable crowd...just a great Harvard-Yale match.”
HARVARD 5, BROWN 2
Harvard began the weekend with a 5-2 victory at Brown, which has yet to defeat an Ivy League foe.
The Crimson started out strong in the doubles play, winning the point by a 3-0 score.
“We started off in doubles really hot like we have all year,” Omodele-Lucien said. “We took the doubles point pretty handily.”
The No. 1 pairing of Omodele-Lucien and Schultz cruised to an 8-3 victory, followed by the No. 2 pairing’s tiebreak win. The No. 3 team, comprised of Tchan and freshman Will McNamee, notched an 8-3 win of its own to complete the sweep.
The singles matches, on the other hand, were not so smooth.
“It’s tough playing at Brown,” Omodele-Lucien said. “They’re a real prideful team.”
Harvard fell at Nos. 2 and 3, but victories at the 1, 4, 5, and 6 positions kept the match in its control.
Felton had the clinching match at No. 5, coming back from a 6-5 break to win in the tiebreak.
“[Felton’s win] was a huge one because he’d been going through the struggle of playing well in a match but not quite being able to seal the guy off,” Fish said. “Brown got pumped up at the break, but instead [Felton] firmed it up and won in a tiebreak.”
In the end, the Bears—missing their top player—simply didn’t have the talent to match the Crimson.
“Brown competed real well,” Fish said. “We just had more experience.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the 10-year history of the O’Leary Cup, Radcliffe heavyweight crew boasts seven titles. Just one year ago, the Black and White raised the Cup after outpacing Dartmouth and Syracuse.
The past few weeks have not been without their share of challenges for the Black and White—which included the team falling out of the national rankings—but Radcliffe came out on Saturday looking to turn around its season.
The cold and misty conditions on the Charles River also provided an intense backdrop for the Black and White lightweights, who squared off against No. 2 Stanford after a two-week hiatus from competition.
The lightweights lost to Stanford’s top boat, splitting their two races with the Cardinal. Meanwhile, the heavyweights came away with a victory over Syracuse, but fell to their Ancient Eight rival.
RADCLIFFE HEAVYWEIGHTS VS. NO. 16 DARTMOUTH/SYRACUSE
Radcliffe drew wins in two races and posted runner-up finishes in three others on Saturday in the Elizabeth H. O’Leary Cup, named for the Black and White’s head coach of 24 seasons.
The second varsity boat established a clear lead in the opening strokes and held steady for the rest of the course length, crossing the finish line more than 11 seconds ahead of the Orange at 6:44.0. The varsity four “A” echoed the 2V’s victory, pushing half a boat length ahead of the Big Green by the 500-meter mark. The boat extended its lead over the remainder of the race, coming in at 7:31.9 to Dartmouth’s 7:40.2.
Although the Radcliffe varsity eight (1-4) held pace with the Big Green’s boat at the outset of the race, Dartmouth decisively pulled away by the 1,000-meter point, leaving the Black and White and Syracuse to battle for second place. Radcliffe made its move on the Orange in the second half of the race, crossing the finish in 6:32.0—four seconds in front of Syracuse but almost 12 seconds shy of Dartmouth’s boat.
“We worked really hard this week, with the coaches giving us a lot of technical feedback,” said 1V rower and co-captain Christine Baugh. “It wasn’t just that we had faster people [this time around], but faster boats.”
The second-place overall finish bodes well for the Black and White, which has struggled as of late. Prior to the O’Leary Cup, Radcliffe heavyweight crew had lost three straight races to Ivy League opponents Brown, Princeton, and Cornell. The team was also burdened by injuries, which prompted O’Leary to alter boat lineups. Still, this weekend’s win over Syracuse may be the starting point of the Black and White’s rebound.
“I keep saying that we’re a work in progress,” O’Leary said. “There’s talent on this team, and we need to tap into that 100 percent. On the one hand, we’re looking ahead to the championships, but we have to work week by week to get there.”
NO. 4 RADCLIFFE LIGHTWEIGHTS vs. NO. 2 STANFORD
The Radcliffe lightweights knew they had their work cut out for them facing the nation’s second-best crew. The Black and White didn’t let that fact damper its outlook going into the race.
“The girls were definitely eager to perform their best,” Radcliffe coach Heather Cartwright said. “I think the conditions threw them off. We faced 16 mph tailwind, which is among the most difficult conditions. And Stanford brought its A-game to the race.”
In spite of an adverse competition environment and a formidable opponent, the Black and White managed a draw against Stanford, losing the first varsity race and capturing the second. Radcliffe was unable to maintain overlap with the Cardinal’s 1V boat (4-1), which finished nearly 12 seconds ahead of the Black and White (2-1) in 6:42.7.
But Radcliffe’s second varsity eight’s performance stood testament to the team’s progress this season. Battling chilly temperatures and light rain, the 2V incrementally widened its lead over Stanford, breaking free on the open after the first 1,500 meters. The Black and White clocked in 7.5 seconds ahead of the Cardinal at 7:00.5.
“We expected a fast crew [in Stanford],” said 2V rower and co-captain Grace Hollowell. “We did a good job of staying composed and handling the [weather] conditions well. We just found our rhythm and made our move at the 1,000-meter mark to really commit.”

Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman—famous for blowing things up and testing popular myths on their show “MythBusters”—were honored for their work in propagating humanist values Friday evening by the Harvard Secular Society and the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy.
The Secular Society’s president Lewis M. Ward ’11 said at the awards ceremony to a packed audience in Memorial Church that the MythBusters duo won the group’s fourth Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism for teaching people not to blindly accept myths on their “incredibly entertaining show.”
After receiving a trophy inscribed with the duo’s well-known quote—“failure is always an option”—Savage opened his acceptance speech with a reference to the prevalence of new technology.
“I am going to read my speech from my iPad,” Savage said. “I’m not only a humanist, I am an early adapter.”
Savage ultimately concluded from his efforts to understand the purposes of prayer and organized religion that man does not “need religion in order to appreciate [one’s] existence” and instead should rely on his own observations and logic.
Following Savage and Hyneman’s speeches, audience members peppered the duo with questions ranging from future projects to the show’s production.
The pair gave a sneak preview of potential upcoming episodes in responding to a question about the show’s future plans.
“It seems weird to promote a television show in a church, but we have a unified dream of [creating] a human-powered helicopter,” Savage said.
“Square wheels,” Hyneman countered.
With puns and characteristic deadpan humor, the MythBusters kept the presentation lively and entertaining.
“So much of what we see on TV is deliberately designed to deceive, or exaggerate, or promote someone’s agenda, and the MythBusters is the complete opposite,” said audience member John S. Dwyer, who added that he found Savage and Hyneman “extremely funny.”
Past recipients of the cultural humanism award have included creator of the shows “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and “Firefly” Joss Whedon, Greg Graffin of the punk rock band Bad Religion, and novelist Sir Salman Rushdie.

In celebration of the 40th anniversary of “An Evening with Champions,” some of the country’s preeminent ice skaters brought life to the ice at the Bright Hockey Center this weekend.
The event, hosted by former Olympic gold medalists Dick Button and Peggy Fleming, a cancer survivor, donates proceeds to the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s Jimmy Fund, which supports the fight against cancer.
This year’s benefit exhibition—which remains the only skating event for charity organized by college students—featured young talents such as former National Collegiate Champion Jason Wong and resident Harvard student and former Olympic participant Emily A. Hughes ’11.
Eighteen routines were performed on each night, including pairs, dance, synchronized skating, group acts, and solo routines.
Event co-chair Brett M. Giblin ’11 said that he felt the event—which also featured a silent auction and autograph signing session—went smoothly.
“The names who came and donated their time to come and skate did so flawlessly,” Giblin said. “From a viewing standpoint, it was the best show I’ve ever seen, and I think everyone really enjoyed it.”
Giblin does not know how much money this year’s event has raised because donations are still being accepted, but he said that the importance of the charity event goes beyond its financial impact.
“I got to meet one of the Jimmy Fund’s survivors at our opening night reception,” Giblin said. “She decided to speak to us, and it was incredible to see how much this event had meant to her.”
“For this family, [An Evening With Champions] meant the world, because their world was that little girl—and the Jimmy Fund and Dana-Farber helped save their world,” he added.
An Evening with Champions was founded in 1970 by John M. Petkevich ’71, who would later become a national figure skating champion. Upon seeing the bedridden patients in the children’s cancer ward at Harvard affiliate Children’s Hospital Boston, Petkevich was inspired to make a difference.
Petkevich came up with the idea of a charity ice skating show, which would bring together an impressive roster of skaters and benefit cancer research.
In the past 40 years, the annual ice show has featured over 200 U.S., World, and Olympic champions, and has raised over $2.4 million for charity.
This year’s An Evening with Champions concluded with a pairs duet by cancer survivor Dorothy Hamill, the 1976 Olympic Champion, and Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic Silver Medalist.
Special guests who returned for the past weekend’s festivities included Tenley Albright, the 1956 Olympic Champion; Nancy Kerrigan, the 1994 Olympic Silver Medalist; and Sarah Hughes, the 2002 Olympic Gold Medalist.

Timothy R. Flaherty announced that he will not seek a recount in the special election for a Mass. State Senate seat, thereby conceding the victory in the Democratic primary to Everett City Councillor Sal N. DiDomenico.
Flaherty, a Cambridge lawyer, had announced on his website on election night last Tuesday that he would seek a recount, citing “voting irregularities in Everett.”
But in a reversal of such intentions, Flaherty released a new statement on Saturday that said he would not request a recount, though he found the alleged irregularities “concerning.”
Flaherty said that he would focus instead on running against DiDomenico in the fall, when the Senate seat comes up for reelection in accordance with the normal schedule.
The Middlesex, Suffolk, and Essex seat—which represents parts of Cambridge and several surrounding towns, including Everett—was vacated in January by Anthony D. Galluccio.
The former Senator is currently serving a year-long jail term for failing a series of breathalyzer tests, in violation of his probation for a hit-and-run accident in October.
Galluccio’s resignation opened a special election for the seat, which six Democrats vied for in the primary last Tuesday. DiDomenico beat Flaherty and the other contenders by 135 votes, according to The Boston Globe.
In the general election on May 11, DiDomenico will face Independent candidate John Cesan, a resident of Agawam.
Local political pundit Robert Winters said that Flaherty and DiDomenico were the two frontrunners throughout the campaign, and that both were likely to run again in September regardless of the outcome of the special election.
“For [Flaherty] to have actually pursued a recount and then lost—as he almost certainly would have—would have soiled him a bit,” Winters said.
None of the other candidates have expressed an intent to run again in September.
According to Winters, Flaherty’s campaign hopes that progressive voters who chose other candidates in last week’s primary will pick Flaherty over DiDomenico in a two-way race.
“I certainly wouldn’t leap to that conclusion,” Winters said. “The presumption here is that somehow most voters were voting along the traditional left to right political spectrum, but people were largely voting along ethnic and identity lines.”
Winters dismissed Flaherty’s claim that he would represent Cambridge better than Everett resident DiDomenico, pointing out that DiDomenico was born in East Cambridge and attended Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.

The Harvard Graduate School of Design removed 3,750 pounds of gravel from the roof of Gund Hall and replaced it with different amounts of organic substrate on Friday afternoon to test different cost-effective methods of green roof retrofitting.
The installation of five additional plots marks the third round of testing led by Christian Werthmann, a professor of landscape architecture at the School of Design who has been looking to create a cost-effective green roof since 2006.
To make a green roof, Werthmann and his team used different amounts of Rooflite—a mineral aggregate with a small amount of organic material that is commonly used in green roof projects—in addition to planting seeds and clippings of sedum, a low flowering plant that tolerates the harsh roof conditions well.
The team has tried other soil and plant types in the past experiments.
If the School of Design successfully installs a green roof, Werthmann said that the plants will be able to absorb excess storm water as well as reduce the amount of sunlight directly hitting Gund Hall.
“This roof tries to be a good citizen,” Werthmann said.
The test plots the team has examined thus far have not yielded strong results and thus do not have the potential to increase the building’s energy efficiency, Werthmann said.
Additionally, Werthmann added that the area of the roof covering the building’s studio space has a very low weight limit that may not support the amount of substrate needed to grow plants.
Werthmann has only been able to place two inches of substrate on the roof of Gund Hall—most green roofs require at least four—and only 10 to 20 percent of test areas have sprouted plants.
For an effective green roof, plants should cover about 70 to 100 percent of the area, Werthmann said.
The team will periodically add fertilizer and measure plant coverage throughout the summer to assess the success of the new test plots, said Julia K. Africa, Werthmann’s research assistant.
“We use this roof as really a test roof—it’s not a commercial product,” Werthmann said.
Werthmann added that he hopes to create a cost-effective model for installing green roofs, as the high costs of the new green technologies often deters companies and other institutions from retrofitting old buildings.
“We go from the deluxe version to the really poor man’s version,” Werthmann said.
Christoph F. Reinhart, a professor at the School of Design, said that creating a green roof at Gund Hall may not save the school as much energy as other green projects, such as new insulation for the building.
“It’s an interesting technology,” Reinhart said. “But I’m not really convinced that it’s practical.”

Sitting together in their Hollis double at three a.m. one morning last semester, roommates Smitha Ramakrishna ’13 and Nicole Paulet Piedra ’13 lamented the quickly approaching end of their freshman year.
Memories of writing letters to their future selves in grade school and scenes from the 2009 movie “Knowing” inspired the two to commemorate the past year with a time capsule­ with a 21st century twist.
After talking with their proctor, W. Hugo Van Vuuren ’07, a SEAS fellow who works at the Idea Translation Lab at Harvard, the two decided to “embrace the digital age and create a digital time capsule,” Ramakrishna said.
With the help of their friend Scott J. Yim ’13, the pair filmed over 50 freshmen speaking candidly to their future selves about friends, Annenberg food, bad movies, extracurriculars, and potential concentrations over the past three weekends.
The videos will be revisited just before Commencement 2013, Ramakrishna said.
Questions ran the gamut from “What music do you like?” to “What’s your greatest fear?” and “What do you hope to do with your future?”
“In the end it was very improvised, more like a conversation,” Paulet Piedra said.
Some of the freshman filmed even sang and danced, Ramakrishna said, though she added that many responses were more serious in tone.
“It’s a transitional time, you’re wrapping things up as a first year student, realizing this does go by very quickly,” said Director for Freshman Programming Katherine W. Steele, whose office provided funding, support, and publicity for the project. “Part of that is life here is so frantic, and when you take a step back and think about what really matters about your college experience, I could see how it could quickly become emotional.”
Ramakrishna said if more students wish to participate in the digital time capsule, she and her roommate may run additional filming sessions.
Though the pair have not decided how they will unveil the footage senior year, they said the videos will probably be uploaded to a website or distributed in CD form during senior week at a premiere event.
While waiting for his interview, Jose Arturo Villanueva ’13 mentioned that he saw many students remind their future selves to take nothing for granted.
“I hope to look back and smile and then say to myself, ‘look, young Arturo was right,’ and be satisfied and just take it well,” he said.

The term “fast food” doesn’t usually conjure up images of healthy sandwiches and homemade popovers, but Ayr Muir, owner of a popular MIT food truck, is hoping to change that when he opens the latest extension of Clover Food Lab, a restaurant at 7 Holyoke Street in Harvard Square.
The goal of the restaurant is simple, Muir explained, “Good food at a low price, and quickly.”
The prototype of the Clover Food Lab is the popular Clover Fast Food Truck, started in September of 2008, by Muir, an MIT graduate.
The truck was supposed to be a six month test of Muir and his associate’s dream of providing good, healthy, cheap fast food, but the crowds of foodies, students, businessmen, janitors, secretaries, and locals refused to see it go.
Clover serves all-vegetarian fare. Additionally, Muir said, “We probably serve more local, organic food than other restaurants in the area, but we don’t tell our customers.”
With the exception of mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard, Clover kitchens makes all of their own food, according to Muir.
But these things shouldn’t weigh heavily on the customer’s mind, Muir said.
“Nine out of ten of our customers are not vegetarians,” he said.
Ultimately, to the owners of Clover Fast Food, it should all come down to taste.
The restaurant’s menu will be very similar to the truck’s, with “delicious meals you can enjoy everyday without detriment to your health,” Muir said.
The lunch and dinner menus include four or five sandwiches. The restaurant will also offer soups in the spring, winter, and fall, and salads in the summer.
Special highlights include popovers and muffins made fresh every hour, and an assortment of flavored lemonades and iced teas.
Denise Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, expressed high hopes for the new restaurant.
“I think that Clover, because of its more casual food and more casual way of doing business, will get lots of people to come down to Holyoke street which is always good for all businesses in the area,” Jillson said.
The restaurant is currently under construction. Jillson says that the owners are hoping to open around late spring.

People in search of a few beers and some chicken wings were in for a shock if they headed to the Queen’s Head Pub on Saturday evening.
A confused-looking circle of men in sports t-shirts stared in perplexity at the stage, which overflowed with a massive dancing drag queen bedecked in a pink wig, Kermit the frog pajamas, and knee-high lace-up pleather platform boots.
“Are y’all here for something called Drag Night?” screeched the Kermit-clad queen, who hails as Becca D’Bus onstage and was the MC for this year’s event, hosted by the Harvard Queer Students and Allies.
The euphoric cries of “Hell yeah!” caused even the beer-drinkers watching basketball across the pub to stand up and take note. By the time D’Bus offered to take off her shirt and proceeded to de-wig and de-robe onstage, all eyes were glued to the performer.
Though many performers were dressed to impress in their best sequined gowns, cascading wigs, and voluptuous padding, D’Bus was adamant that the night was not just about pretty boys masquerading as pretty girls.
Other spectators and performers joined in the game of performing gender-nonconformity.
“What’s awesome about drag is it challenges the status quo,” said Avieyonne Flieux (pronounced avian flu), a student at Harvard Medical School who does drag to raise awareness for HIV/AIDS. Flieux performed a lip sync to “And I am Telling You I’m Not Going” to the screeches of the audience and the recoiling of the men who had come to talk about sports.
“A lot of people don’t understand that not everybody in society feels they can be defined,” Flieux said, “and drag makes people think outside of the box and outside of gender definitions.”
Flieux’s cheeks were painted with extravagant eyelashes and big black tears, and the rest of the ensemble included fishnet stockings, converse sneakers, a black dress with a heavy gold collar, and a tall black wig decorated with multi-colored bows.
Other performers included Marcelito, who performed the song “Girls” in male drag, wearing a trucker hat and baggy jeans with a pair of socks tucked in front to create a bulge, and Boyonce, whose gold sequins flashed so brightly as she performed “Halo” in the dimly lit pub that the audience was almost blinded by the glitter.
After exchanging compliments on sequins and choreography with Flieux, Boyonce returned to the stage.
“Guess what, audience,” she lilted, “Lady Gaga’s here!”
Boyonce and the Gaga-lookalike, who goes by Golda Mansacks, lip synced for their lives together to “Telephone,” shaking their way through the audience and ending with a catfight onstage. People from all corners of the pub had moved closer to watch, and gender-bending spectators and sports-watchers alike cheered for the glittering duet.
Cherry Blossom ’11, co-chair of the QSA, flicked back strands of her long black wig as she pronounced Drag Night a success.
“A lot of queer events are really serious, and this is the event where people are on the floor, shaking their thang, with glitter, stars, and garlands everywhere,” she said.
Relaxing after the show, Boyonce, Mansacks, and D’Bus each ordered a beer and sat down to discuss makeup tricks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The ominous clouds and rain forecast forced the usual pre-Yardfest picnic into dining halls, but the sporadic drizzle did not dissuade undergraduates from attending the College’s fifth annual Yardfest last night.
With anticipation highest for hip-hop artist Kid Cudi, best known for his single “Day ‘n’ Nite,” the concert also featured indie-folk artist Patrick Park and rapper Wale, attracting about 4,500 attendees, according to College Events Board chair Moira E. Forberg ’11 and vice-chair Stephen G. Anastos Jr ’11.
The event began with the relaxed, mellow vibe of Patrick Park’s guitar, but few guests were in attendance at the time. The audience totaled 29 people initially, with over 50 spectators by the end of Park’s first two numbers.
Park began the concert with the song “Honest Screw” while attendees frolicked around the four tire swings laid out around Tercentenary Theatre.
But many more streamed in as Wale took the stage, with some enthusiastic concert-goers carrying neon pink and yellow whale cut-outs inscribed with Wale’s name and even hoisting friends on their shoulders. The audience cheered and swayed their arms as Wale played “Chillin’.”
Wale’s rap led into Kid Cudi’s similar energetic hip-hop stylings, replete with bright, multicolored lights that heightened the excitement by shining a blue-and-white pinwheel against Widener Library and punctuating the words “Oh, oh, oh” in his song “Mr. Solo Dolo” with bright white flashes.
Attendees pressed up against the stage and against each other in an effort to catch a glimpse of the artist, who encouraged audience enthusiasm with his “I say Kid, you say Cudi” call-and-response.
But the crowd had to wait until the very end to hear Kid Cudi perform his most popular single, “Day ‘n’ Nite.”
He abruptly left the stage after playing the song, but returned to cheers to play another one of his well-known singles, “Pursuit of Happiness.”
Many attendees raved about this year’s concert, particularly the choice of artists and Kid Cudi’s selection.
“I’m so glad Harvard finally got such a good Yardfest together,” said Belinda R. J. O’Donnell ’11, who said this year’s concert was the best of her time here.
“This is a concert I would pay to see,” said Alexander J. Pease ’10. “It was free, and I really appreciate it.”
The CEB, who co-sponsored the event with the Harvard Concert Commission, said they were pleased with the event’s turnout.
Despite a forecast that predicted rain, forcing the relocation of dinner from the Yard to dining halls, the attendees experienced only a light drizzle.
“We fell in the better 50 percent,” Forberg said of the forecast that predicted a 50 percent chance of rain, adding, “I think we made a good call being cautious with the food.”
Dining halls, instead of offering a standard dinner menu, served kebabs, corn dogs, and pretzels.
But even though attendance could not be encouraged by the presence of dinner in the Yard, the artists were still able to leave them satisfied, according to many guests.
“That was amazing,” said Michael Zhang ’12.

Spencer B. L. Lenfield ’12, the recipient of the 110th annual Jacob Wendell Scholarship Prize, was honored at a dinner held at Loeb House on Saturday evening.
Lenfield, a History and Literature concentrator who lives in Eliot, will receive $17,000 in recognition of his academic distinction.
“I feel so thrilled and honored to receive this,” Lenfield said.
At the dinner, toasts were given by the oldest recipient of the scholarship present, Charles Hoppin, followed by the second oldest and then by a member of the Wendell family, Nathalie Wendell Thomas.
The family continues to fund the scholarship, 110 years after Barrett Wendell founded it in honor of his father, Jacob.
After being introduced by Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman, Lenfield also gave a brief speech, in which he said that the award was not only a recognition of the recipient’s potential, but a challenge to “go and use these resources to keep growing, keep exploring, keep acquiring the ideas that will allow you to become that person.”
He will use the money to study literature in Paris and Cambridge, England this summer, following a tradition of Wendell scholars using the award for summer plans.
Outside of class, Lenfield is a Ledecky Fellow at Harvard Magazine, a position rarely given to sophomores. He has also worked at the Radcliffe Institute for the past two years, and is one of 10 Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellows—a program encouraging minority students to pursue Ph.D.s.
In an emailed statement, Lenfield advised students interested in literature and the arts not to over-schedule and leave enough time to “explore things completely unrelated to your coursework”.
The prize is open to any student at the beginning of their sophomore year, and is judged based on their academic performance as freshmen.
This year, 120 sophomores applied, with eight finalists making it through to interviews. The application process is fairly light, as candidates need only to fill out a uniform application, submit a sample paper and provide an academic reference from a professor.
David Jeruzalmi, Associate Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology and member of the selection committee for the prize, commented that although excellence in class must be the main factor, “overall, we look at the whole profile” of a student.

Acts of civilian sexual violence have become increasingly pervasive in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to a recent study released on April 15 by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative and Oxfam America, an international relief and development organization.
The study’s analysis of violence trends over time revealed that although the total number of sexual assaults reported steadily decreased between 2004 and 2008, the number of civilian rapes increased seventeen-fold.
“These findings imply a normalization of rape among the civilian population, suggesting the erosion of all constructive social mechanism that ought to protect civilians from sexual violence,” according to the study.
The study, Now the World is Without Me, reported that women in South Kivu are subject to sexual violence regardless of age, marital status, or ethnicity, and that they are attacked not only in fields and forests but also in their own homes.
“Some of the results were shocking, mostly that the women are really attacked everywhere and that everyone is at risk” said Susan A. Bartels, a researcher at Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, emergency room physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and primary author of the report. “I was shocked by the number of women who were attacked in their own home, specifically at night when they were sleeping with their families.”
The study also demonstrates how sexual violence can be used as a tool to ignite terror.
“It’s a very important study and a very disturbing study because it documents how the use of rape in times of war can then spill over into peacetime and devastate a whole community,” said Jaqueline Bhabha, director of the University Committee on Human Rights Studies.
The study offers several key recommendations to help ameliorate the situation in the Congo, including ensuring quality care is available for women, working to reduce sexual violence, and building on the legal and justice initiative taken to date.
“A lot of people wonder what they can do here, in Boston or in the US,” Bartels said, “and to that I would say to help raise awareness and to perhaps consider supporting organizations that are working [in the Congo].”

Though the man responsible for breaking into the home of Harvard Physics Professor Roy J. Glauber ’45 was arrested on Friday, Glauber’s stolen Nobel Prize medal has not yet been recovered.
Last month, a burglar—identified as Stephen Beaulieu—broke into Glauber’s home in Arlington, Mass. and stole the prestigious award that the professor had won in 2005 for his contributions to the quantum theory of optical coherence.
Upon discovering one of Beaulieu’s food stamp receipts in Glauber’s home, police arrested Beaulieu in Russel, Mass. and placed him in a Cambridge jail, according to The Boston Herald.
But Glauber’s Nobel Prize has not yet surfaced.
Captain Robert Bongiorno of the Arlington police department said on Saturday that his office has reached out to law enforcement agencies across New England at the local, state, and federal level and that he was confident the prize would be recovered.
“This is a quite unique case for us,” Bongiorno said.
“In my law enforcement career, I’ve never seen anything like this,” he added.
Based on the Nobel medal’s “unique qualities,” Bongiorno said that “it’s in someone’s best interest” to return the prize to the authorities.
Since 1980, Nobel medals have been made of 18-karat green gold and then plated with 24-karat gold. Given the medal’s unmistakable design and mold, an attempt to sell the medal would be difficult.
Bongiorno said that Arlington forces will continue the “open and active” search for the prize.
“Because of [the Nobel medal’s] significant emotional value to the professor, it is a priority of ours to recover that for him,” Bongiorno added.
Assuming that the Arlington police fail to recover the 2005 medal, the question remains whether the Nobel Prize committee would issue Glauber another medal.
Members of the Nobel Prize committee could not be reached for comment on Saturday.

Dozens of couples were supposed to make out in Winthrop Park this past Saturday afternoon—not in random acts of passion, but in competition. The French Kiss-a-Thon, put on by the Boston Babydolls Burlesque, was meant to be a publicity stunt for its new show, conveniently titled “French Kiss.”
However, the rainy weather put a damper on everyone’s passion as many couples failed to show, including the organizers. But for three couples, like Samuel Q. Singer ’13 and his girlfriend, the rain was no match.
According to Singer, he was planning to kiss for one hour with the support of a cheering section, who also didn’t show for the rain. Singer even came prepared with a filled water bottle and straw, explaining, “The rules [of the Kiss-a-Thon] were the lips had to touch,” so he could drink from the straw while still kissing his partner.
The French Kiss-a-Thon has been rescheduled and will take place next Saturday, Apr. 24, at 5 p.m. Unfortunately for Singer and his girlfriend, they might not be able to participate in the outpouring of passion due to a ballroom competition.

A boat’s name can endow the shell with special meaning and be a unifying force among its oarsmen. In my time as a rower, I have seen a variety of boat names painted across bow decks. Some names have resounded with qualities that are intrinsic to any successful crew, such as “Persistence” or “Resilience,” while others have left me staring blankly, or even worse, fighting a fit of laughter.
This past Saturday, the Harvard men’s heavyweight varsity dedicated its sleek, yellow Empacher eight to Olympic gold medalist and former Crimson rower, Malcolm Howard ’05. There is no question what the name of this boat will represent to those who sit in its seats.
At Harvard, Howard made it his job to get crews across the finish line first. In his three years on the varsity squad, Howard went undefeated in intercollegiate competition, helping secure three consecutive national titles for the Crimson.
After college, Howard went on to train and compete at the international level, representing his home country, Canada. At the 2008 Olympics, Howard was a member of the Canadian men’s eight that won gold in Beijing. The following year, Rowing News selected him for honorable mention in the search for Male Athlete of the Year for 2009.
Howard’s rowing career is a record of excellence and accomplishment, something that he shares in common with the shell that now bears his name. The new Harvard varsity boat happens to bring with it a legacy of success that is already entwined with Howard’s rowing history. The Empacher is the shell that Howard raced in at Beijing as the Canadian men’s eight rowed to gold.
Many former Harvard rowers returned to Newell Boathouse and to the Charles River banks on Saturday to watch the dedication of the Malcolm Howard ’05 and to see it race the Princeton Tigers and MIT Engineers for the Compton Cup. For those who witnessed the race, it was a true testament to the durability of the hull. The Tigers veered into Harvard’s lane after losing their steering mechanism. Princeton’s bow deck collided with the stern of the Malcolm Howard ’05, and, while the Tiger’s bow cracked and a large end portion was lost to the Charles, the Harvard eight moved swiftly away, structurally undamaged, and finished first to claim the Compton Cup.
Certainly, this boat is living up to its name thus far, and after this past weekend’s encounter with Princeton, the legend of the Malcolm Howard ’05 will only grow.

Radcliffe rugby had a score to settle this weekend after being left out of the national tournament, and when the dust settled, the scoreboard at the Beast of the East 2010 Tournament spoke loud and clear.
No. 7 Radcliffe steamrolled its opponents in the two-day tournament over the weekend, winning four-straight matches without yielding a single point en route to a convincing victory in Portsmouth, R.I.
With a cumulative margin of victory of 102-0 against Stony Brook, George Washington, Bryant, and Marist, “Rad Rugby” continued to stake its claim as one of the nation’s top squads.
With the Beast of the East starting on the same weekend as nationals, every Radcliffe player had the same thing on her mind.
“People had a bitter taste in their mouths after the game in the fall where we were up by 10 points, and if we had won, we would be [at] nationals,” junior Madeleine Ballard said. “[This tournament] was particularly poignant for the team, thinking, ‘Guess where we could have been this weekend?’ So the theme for the weekend was, ‘We are the best team in the country, so let’s go show people.”
Radcliffe certainly didn’t waste much time, overwhelming Stony Brook, 43-0 in the opening contest. After a close 5-0 victory over George Washington to finish Saturday’s competition, it was smooth sailing for the Radcliffe team, which posted 26- and 28-point wins over Bryant and Marist yesterday to take home the title.
“That was the biggest game of the [spring] season for us this past weekend,” said Ballard, referencing Radcliffe’s domination of the largest collegiate rugby tournament in the country.
And as the team closes out the year with its No. 7 ranking likely to rise, Radcliffe feels primed to return to national championship form. Although the squad has not hoisted the trophy since 1998, Radcliffe coach Bryan Hamlin, a New Zealand native, has the team moving in the right direction after two years at the helm, according to Ballard.
“[Hamlin]...brought new ideas and new strategies to the game that not a lot of American teams had been exercising,” she said. “That really turned it around. Anytime a team is struggling and you get new ideas, it changes the dynamic.”
Radcliffe Rugby will have to wait until the fall to get its next shot at a national title, but until then, the squad has its sights set on a few enemies.
“One goal is to take it to Brown—the No. 1 team in Division I—a perennial foe of ours,” Ballard said. “When we were bad [in previous years], they gave us quite a few beatdowns.”
If the team’s effort at Beast of the East is any indication, Radcliffe may soon be ready to return the favor.

“A lot of people are intimidated by hip-hop dancing,” said Cory A. Johnson ’11, a dancer for the Expressions Dance Company.
But in order to show the Harvard population that hip-hop dancing is nothing to fear, Expressions is offering two dance workshops on April 21 and April 28.
The workshops, which are scheduled to run from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at 74 Mt. Auburn Street,  will feature choreography taught by Jena N. Mills ’11, Mark A. Terrelonge Jr. ’10, Nicholas N. Culbertson ’11, and Layla Amjadi ’10, according to an e-mail sent over the Expressions list.
During each session, the first hour of the workshop will be devoted to beginners, while the second hour will be directed towards intermediate and advanced dancers.
“Beginners shouldn’t feel like they should shy away from staying for both halves,” said Terrelonge. “Even the more advanced people will get something from the first half because they can work on style and not have to worry about memorizing choreography.”
The Expressions directors interviewed for this post said they want the dance workshops to be a fun, low-key way for beginners interested in dance but too intimidated by auditions to check out hip-hop dance choreography.
“It’s a chance to try something new and become a better dancer,” Terrelonge said.
A graduate of the Expressions workshop who went on to become a director of Expressions, Mills said that the classes offer students the opportunity to try out hip-hop dance in a low-stress environment.
“The workshops are kind of a test-drive for auditions,” she said. “Hopefully we’ll give people a chance to see what it’s like, and hopefully they’ll try out in the fall.”
