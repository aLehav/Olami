After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rapid transit has been a quirky fascination of mine since I was a little kid. Back then, the only form of transportation I ever really took was the back of my mother’s minivan, and the thought of a train that ran underground piqued both my terror and my curiosity.
I was therefore fairly surprised when I came to Harvard and started hearing scores of disgruntled New Yorkers complaining about the MBTA’s dearth of late-night service. Being from Massachusetts and thus having grown up making New York the frequent object of a half-joking derision, I chalked up the complaints as mere snobbery and a lack of appreciation.
But then I realized that those New Yorkers were right, and not just because the lack of late night service makes travel more difficult for fun-seeking college students. As it stands today, Boston is a fairly large city that—for all intents and purposes—shuts down after midnight. Compare our sleeping city at 2 in the morning to the hustle and bustle of downtown Manhattan. In New York City, businesses stay open, people are out and about, and the subway system is running.
Of course, our early-closing T service is far from the only cause of Boston’s lack of late night activity. Rather, the opposite is more likely: true to its Puritan heritage, our city has traditionally been inactive at night. When the MBTA opened and as such became the first American subway system, those traditions were still in effect. It wouldn’t have made any sense to keep the T running late at night—there wouldn’t have been any people up to use it.
Nowadays, the benefits to extending late night service are clear. According to a recent Boston Globe survey, large numbers of Bostonians and Boston area college students believe that late night T service would improve the city’s nightlife, which would be a boon to the economy. Commuters working late night shifts—such as nurses—would be able to get home in a safer and easier manner. The increased activity could attract more start-ups and other businesses, and make the city less desolate (and thus, safer) at night.
Realistically, these benefits would come at some cost. Later service on the T, for example, would facilitate the travels of late-night party-goers. This possibility is problematic on several levels: intoxicated people could present security problems at night, or businesses could see an increasing number of hung over workers on early Monday mornings, leading to unforeseen costs.
Later hours would also mean increased operational costs, including costs related to running the actual vehicles, paying conductors and other staff, and providing security. But the Globe’s recent survey should assure the city that keeping the T open later would mean increased ridership, which could defray the costs and even turn a profit.
The claim that the T cannot afford to extend late night service is also questionable considering the number of expensive projects in the pipeline. These include the recently-opened commuter rail service to Hyannis on Cape Cod, lines to New Bedford and Fall River, and a physical extension of the Green Line into Somerville and Medford.
All of these projects are compelling on paper. They’re also expensive—running commuter rail trains requires using diesel, and an extension of the Green Line means all the costs of building news rails and stations.
These projects come after significant cuts in service and hikes in rider fares, as well as at a time when the MBTA could vastly improve service on existing lines. Late-night service would be a sound investment choice that wouldn’t require costs associated with building rails and lines, and which could actually bring some much needed revenue into the system.
At least some Massachusetts politicians seem to be on board with this sort of idea. Governor Deval Patrick ’78 JD ’82 proposed in January that the legislature pass a transportation bill containing provisions for late-night service and much-needed upgrades to existing services as well as several capital projects. In the political battle that ensued, however, the Legislature passed a bill that prioritizes capital projects, despite Governor Patrick’s veto. The new bill contains provisions for exploring the possibilities of late night service, but does not guarantee its implementation.
Perhaps the best hope for smart investments in the MBTA is the current mayoral race in Boston. Most mayoral candidates have embraced the notion of expanding and improving service on existing lines, including late-night service. Mayoral candidate and City Councilor John Connolly ’95, for example, asserted that “we ought to be focused on extending the T hours” and that Boston should become a “24-hour city” to unlock its “economic potential.”
In order to fully unlock that potential, Boston must maximize the benefits it reaps from its existing rapid transit system. Extending late night-night hours, making necessary repairs, and improving service on existing lines are surefire ways to do so.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just a month ago, with the nation’s focus on the fleeing Edward Snowden, an under-the-radar Congress blocked an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The quiet amendment would have made it impossible for the President to lock up American citizens without a trial, a right the executive branch has grabbed in recent years. In fact, the NDAA is only one instance of a festering government problem since Iraq—the dramatic, Congress-sanctioned, expansion of executive power.
Snowden, with his leaks to Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian, was part of the newspaper’s big early-summer investigation into the NSA’s surveillance program on average Americans that involved seizing millions of phone records from Verizon and spying without warrants. With Snowden doing a Carmen Sandiego-esque trot around the world—he’s currently been granted asylum in Russia—the focus has shifted from the issues he championed to the face of the movement. In the furor, one thing has been swept under the rug: what the NSA did wasn’t illegal.
Following the September 11 attacks, al Qaeda became a household name and the face for terrorism abroad. President George W. Bush quickly declared a “war on terror,” a convenient semantic twist allowing him to claim the executive powers of a president in wartime. On September 15, a Bush administration memorandum said—blatantly incorrectly—that “no statute passed by Congress ‘can place any limits on the president’s determinations as to any terrorist threat…or the method, timing, and nature of the response.’” His administration quickly claimed that presidents have every right to violate laws of Congress—with, among other offenses, warrantless wiretapping—to justify the war on terror, a mockery of our Founding Fathers’ separation of powers principles.
In wartime, presidents today have more freedom than ever to grab unilateral power for both the government and themselves. Bush, like predecessors FDR and Abraham Lincoln, appealed to a national jingoistic spirit, using the ‘war on terror’ label to appeal to America’s patriotism. In the heat of national fear, the government pushed the Patriot Act through Congress before each member had time to read it. Not long after came an expansion of the wiretapping program and in the following months, there was much less judicial and congressional review of the programs sanctioned by the Patriot Act.
Barack Obama was supposed to end it. The former Illinois senator said before taking office that “warrantless surveillance of American citizens … is unlawful and unconstitutional,” but his administration has presided over the passing of the NDAA—fulfilling a Bush administration claim that US citizens denounced as terrorists should be denied even the most basic legal protections—and a doubling of the wiretapping programs started under Bush.
Even ignoring the issues of drones and Guantanomo Bay it is shocking to see the lack of accountability presidents face on this issue.  But in the context of the Obama administration’s scary precedent of unilaterally taking the life of an American and the recently passed NDAA that includes half a billion dollars to permanently keep open the prison it is unjustifiable. In debates, Mitt Romney largely ignored these issues when given a national stage to criticize Obama. Even in the wake of the NSA findings, Obama’s approval rating is essentially unchanged since before the crisis. His own party, which enacted a filibuster of the Patriot Act in 2005 that Bush called ‘inexcusable’, has been silent on the issue.
For large portions of the decade since Iraq, Congress has been complicit in this seizure of power by the executive branch. When senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) proposed amendments at the end of 2012 to make the NSA accountable, a bipartisan majority stopped it. When questions came up about how the NSA conducts surveillance, which involved capturing Internet communications “directly from the servers of nine leading American companies,” a congressman said the program would have stopped 9/11. Much of what the Obama and Bush administrations have done has been sanctioned, not condemned, by the legislative branch.
It’s worth noting that neither administration has committed as egregious power grabs as previous presidents. From John Adams’ Alien and Sedition Acts—allowing him to lock up opposing politicians whose views he did not tolerate—to FDR’s Japanese-American internment camps, the executive branch doesn’t have a spotless record on liberty. However, a comparative excuse is no excuse at all. The “war on terror” has cloaked a dramatic power grab by America’s executive branch that has gone largely uncontested in Congress. Appeals to patriotism have led to legislation designed to protect the average American from attacks abroad but have removed their safeguards at home. Edward Snowden flees, but even as the media tracks his every move, the government treats him like the pawn he is. And, as a series of recent articles released by The Guardian bring to light, the executive branch and NSA—backed by a Congress-approved Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act—are undeterred and unaccountable.
