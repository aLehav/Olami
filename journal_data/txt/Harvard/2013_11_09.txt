After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the Crimson women’s basketball team faced Princeton for the first time last season, they lost 67-51. The team entered the locker room frustrated after the tough loss, ready to hear its senior leaders and captains give their critique. But then-sophomore Kaitlyn Dinkins started talking.
Although she hadn’t played a minute in the game, her teammates listened intently as Dinkins offered the squad her own words of encouragement. No one uttered a sound as she brought herself to tears, emphasizing the endless possibilities the team still had in front of them.
“[The game] was so disheartening,” Dinkins said. “Because I was so emotional, and so passionate about it, I forget what I said. I remember everyone sitting there and realizing that was it. At that moment, I felt appreciated by my team and knew my leadership had grown a lot.”
Fast forward to the end of the season and Dinkins, who averaged 5.4 minutes a game, was selected as co-captain for the 2013-2014 campaign. Despite the relative lack of time competing on the court, neither her teammates nor her coach was the least bit surprised.
“Even though she doesn’t have the stats, even though she hasn’t played much in her career, she leads by example just as much as I do, just as much as anybody on the team,” co-captain Christine Clark said. “It just doesn’t necessarily happen during games, but during practice, all of her teammates know that Kaitlyn is always going to give 110 percent and they strive to match that effort level.”
Dinkins came to the Crimson after leading Pace Academy High School to the Georgia state championship game for the first time in program history. As the captain of a small private high school basketball team, Dinkins learned to lead and developed the skills she hopes to use to guide the Crimson this season.
“People were there for different reasons,” Dinkins said. “I learned how to communicate and cater to different learning styles and adjust my leadership skills to their responses to what I was saying. Emotion and talk has always been my thing. I like to get people motivated and riled up and ready to play.”
Although Dinkins was surprised when she was named captain, she recognizes the effect her contributions from the bench have had on her team during the past two years.
“I’m a person who has a lot of energy and likes to get other people motivated,” Dinkins said. “Every time there’s a huge play or we need a stop on defense, we start cheering on the bench, running up and down and giving each other high fives. I think that that energy is just so contagious on the court.”
Her teammates can attest to the enthusiasm Dinkins generates and the important role she plays on a daily basis by passing along that passion and energy to the rest of the team.
“I think she’s going to continue to hold us accountable and make sure we’re holding our other teammates accountable for giving 110 percent,” junior forward Erin McDonnell said. “She has so much grit. That’s a great word to describe her as a player and her pure love for Harvard women’s basketball…. She wants us to be Ivy League champions and to be successful because she loves us as players and people.”
Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith recognizes many of those same qualities in her co-captain and appreciates the example she sets for the rest of the team.
“Her work ethic, her leadership…she can listen, she can process, and she can implement,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s fundamentally sound, she’s loved and admired by every single person in this program, and that’s the heart and soul of our program.”
Even if Dinkins can’t always be on the court alongside her fellow co-captain Clark, she knows her contributions will be just as valuable in other areas.
“We have two captains managing both sides of the game, which is awesome,” Dinkins said. “Obviously, I want to be on the court. I love playing basketball. I just have to keep in mind that whatever my role is is whatever is best for the team and that’s how it has to be. People always look to me for energy, talk, and getting people going. No matter if I don’t play, my effort and attitude are going to be the same the whole time.”
Clark acknowledges Dinkins’ leadership as a main asset to the team’s focus and morale, saying that the junior can lead with her words, as well her play.
“Everyone has a high level of respect for Kaitlyn,” Clark said. “If she puts the team first, everyone else is going to put the team first. Everyone else is going to be more unselfish and not get down about not playing.”
Dinkins might not have the numbers to back up her success, but her coach won’t deny this player’s ability to lead her team.
“She is a player with a tremendous court IQ who you can call on to fill any role,” Delaney-Smith said. “And I’m not going to say Kaitlyn’s going to play or not play, but I’m going to tell you that if you need a solid player that can do exactly what she’s told without mistakes, Kaitlyn is probably the best on the team at that.”
After two seasons wearing a Crimson jersey, the Atlanta, Ga., native appreciates the time she has already spent on the team and anxiously anticipates this season.
“It’s been so much more than I could have ever imagined,” Dinkins said. “We go at it really hard on the court. It’s a competition, but it’s all so we can make each other better. Off the court, we have each other’s backs. The commitment everyone has is so different than anything I’ve ever experienced. We all want to be there every day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The score was far from last year’s 69-0 victory, but it was still all Harvard in 2013.
Facing Columbia in New York, the Crimson football team jumped out to an early lead and rode the momentum to a 34-0 victory. For the second straight year, the defense kept the Lions off the scoreboard.
Continuing a recent trend, a large portion of the Crimson’s offensive output came on the ground. The Crimson amassed 202 rushing yards over the course of the game with contributions from several different backs, and all four of Harvard’s touchdowns came on run plays.
“It was a very solid win over Columbia,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I said to our guys coming in, this is a team that has struggled a bit but they continue to play very hard…. That’s the Columbia team we saw today. I thought the game was closer than the score indicated."
Despite the victory, things did not exactly stick to the script for Harvard after it came out firing on all cylinders to start the game, scoring three touchdowns on its first five drives.
More points were much more difficult to come by after that, as Harvard struggled to move the ball offensively for much of the contest. The Crimson offense failed to pick up a first down three times in the middle two quarters and went five consecutive possessions without registering any points.
Following a 15-play, 75-yard drive that ended early in the fourth quarter with a field goal, Harvard coach Tim Murphy replaced starting junior quarterback Conner Hempel with senior quarterback Michael Pruneau. Murphy said Hempel is not injured, and the junior finished with 185 passing yards and one interception.
“I think we got a little too complacent as an offense,” Hempel said. “We lost our intensity a little bit, and that’s obviously good for us because we hadn’t been out in front with a big lead like that early in a game until today…. I think we need to do a better job of applying the pressure even if we’re up 21-0.”
On the other side of the ball, the Lions struggled to gain yards for much of the first half, as the Crimson defense forced four straight three-and-outs to begin the game. Finally, with just over 12 minutes remaining in the second quarter, Columbia quarterback Trevor McDonagh completed a 28-yard pass to move the chains for the first time.
But the Lions would pick up the pace in the latter stages of the game and finished with 216 total yards. Harvard racked up 438 throughout the contest.
The Crimson suffered a big loss offensively when sophomore running back Paul Stanton exited the game in the first quarter. According to Murphy, Stanton is also not hurt and he hoped to give him some additional rest.
But when Stanton was in the game, he certainly had a big effect, totaling 78 yards on just three carries. Other running backs stepped up in Stanton’s absence, as freshman Bo Ellis finished with 53 yards of his own, and junior Andrew Casten contributed an additional 39.
The Crimson consistently turned to the ground game when it needed to make plays. That trend began when Harvard scored its first touchdown of the day on its second drive of the game.
On a second down in Crimson territory, Stanton bounced around the Columbia defensive line and broke free on the right sideline, taking the ball 54 yards all the way to the one-yard line. Hempel took the ball up the gut the very next play for the score to complete the five-play drive.
After the Harvard defense forced a quick punt, Stanton came up big for the second drive in a row. Just one play after a sizable punt return from senior receiver Scott Miller, the sophomore took the handoff, looked up the middle, cut around the Columbia line and streaked 22 yards untouched for the score.
Holding a 14-0 lead, the Crimson would tack on more points just one drive later. Less than a minute into the second quarter, Hempel capped off a methodical, 11-play drive with a one-yard sneak up the middle for his second touchdown of the game.
But Harvard would not tally any additional points until a rushing touchdown from senior Tyler Caveness in the fourth quarter.
With less than a minute remaining in the first half, Harvard failed to convert a fourth down deep in Columbia territory. Instead of running out the clock, McDonagh completed five passes to move the ball all the way to the Crimson 19-yard line. But the Harvard defense ultimately held up, as a fourth down pass attempt fell incomplete.
“[The Lions] gave us a great game today,” captain Joshua Boyd said. “They came out and had some success, and hats off to them. We focused this week on improving our technique, and obviously we’ll take a shutout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Outplayed in the second period for a second straight game at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday, the Harvard men’s hockey team fell to St. Lawrence, 3-1. But the Crimson’s biggest loss of the night came in the first few minutes when freshman forward Alexander Kerfoot went down with a shoulder injury.
“[Kerfoot] is an important player to us,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “We use him in pretty much all situations…. Without him, it shortened our bench and made things more difficult.”
With Kerfoot out, the shorthanded offense struggled to get into a rhythm throughout the evening. Donato shuffled the lineup a bit, shifting sophomore right wing Kyle Criscuolo to center and sophomore Brian Hart to the first line.
“When the lines get switched up, sometimes it’s tough to generate chemistry with guys you haven’t played with,” Vesey said. “[Kerfoot’s] on our power play, so when he goes down, things are a little bit shaken up out there so it’s tough. But I thought we did a good job working through it.”
Just over a minute after the opening whistle, the Saints (5-2-2, 1-0-2 ECAC) got on the board after some crisp passing near the blue line. In his first goal of the season, forward Chris Martin ended Raphael Girard’s two-game shutout streak with a low shot past the left leg of the Harvard senior goaltender to put the Saints up 1-0.
For the rest of the night, the Crimson (2-2-1, 1-2-1) would be playing catch-up. Down 2-0 after the opening period, Harvard pulled within one off its first power play goal of the season coming off the stick of sophomore forward Jimmy Vesey.
“I thought we competed hard,” Vesey said. “But [St. Lawrence] is a good team, and we made a few mistakes and things didn’t work out for us tonight.”
The Crimson came within 49 seconds of skating into the second intermission only being down by one. But forward Alex Hagen took advantage of a rebound off Girard’s left shoulder pad to put the Saints up, 3-1.
“The third goal was a killer,” Donato said. “For them to score with 49 seconds left [in the second period]…that hurt.”
The deficit ultimately proved too much for Harvard to make up in the final frame.
Criscuolo almost pulled the Crimson even midway through the opening period. Threading through the St. Lawrence defense, he maneuvered the puck to right in front of the Saints’ goal.
But like every other shot by Harvard in the first period, it was turned away by Saints senior goaltender Matt Weninger, who had nine saves in the opening frame.
“In the first, I thought we had some chances,” Donato said. “But we weren’t able to establish enough offensive zone time.”
The Saints continued to dictate the pace of the game. With 6:35 remaining in the period, St. Lawrence got a 3-on-2 opportunity off a line change.
Taking a pass from Martin, freshman forward Carey swung a shot from Harvard’s right faceoff circle past Girard’s right shoulder to the corner of the net to put the Saints up, 2-0.
Not much changed coming out of the locker room in the second period, with St. Lawrence continuing to get quality looks and the Crimson struggling to get a rhythm on the offensive end. The Saints took 15 shots in the period to Harvard’s four, including one that hit the pipes next to Girard’s right shoulder a little over five minutes in.
The Crimson earned a power play opportunity seconds later when St. Lawrence forward Jeremy Wick was called for elbowing. The Harvard offense could only get one shot off and for the 16th straight time came up empty in man-up situations.
But the power play would not be shut out for long.
With a little over six minutes remaining in the period, Wick was whistled again, this time for hooking. On the ensuing man-up, Vesey took a pass from the right side and snuck the puck by Saints goalie Matt Weninger to end the Crimson’s drought on the power play.
St. Lawrence’s Hagen took back the momentum five and a half minutes later with the visitors’ third goal. The Saints kept up the offensive pressure after the second intermission, with two of its six shots clanging off the pipes behind Girard.
Though Harvard also took six shots in the frame, the offense could not get another one by Weninger. By the time the Crimson went with an empty net with a little under two minutes to go, the team’s second straight home loss was a foregone conclusion.
“I think we can compete harder,” Donato said. “Certainly, I think we can execute a lot better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The mantra preached by Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker to his team last year was meant to shore up the confidence of a group that had been shaken by the unexpected departure of its two best players: “We may not have what we had, but we have enough.”
A year later, that sentiment sounds comically out of place.
In 2012-13, the roster that remained, led by then-freshman point guard Siyani Chambers, then-sophomore guard Wesley Saunders, and the late-season emergence of then-sophomore big man Kenyatta Smith, carried the Crimson to its third consecutive Ivy title, second straight NCAA tournament bid, and first-ever tournament win over No. 3-seed New Mexico. With only one player—current assistant coach Christian Webster ’13—from that historic team lost to graduation, the return of seniors Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry and the arrival of top-100 prospect freshman Zena Edosomwan have shifted the conversation surrounding Harvard from the Ivy rankings to the national rankings.
The preseason AP poll has the Crimson pegged as the 31st-ranked team in the country, and commentators around the country have anointed this roster as, on paper, the most talented to come out of the Ivy League since the 2009-10 Cornell Big Red, which finished 13-1 in conference play and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen before falling to No. 1-seed Kentucky.
But wins and losses are not awarded on paper. The biggest questions for the Crimson center on how the pieces will fit together and which key contributors from last season must inevitably take a reduced role this year. Both Curry and Chambers have each played a season as the undisputed starter at point guard and now must figure out how to share that job. Smith and Casey will be forced to split minutes in the post with Edosomwan and juniors Steve Moundou-Missi and Jonah Travis. And Saunders, who was first-team All-Ivy and the team’s leading scorer a year ago, may see less of the ball now with all the weapons around him. Attempting to head off any discord, Amaker is now preaching a new refrain for his team: sacrifice.
“We know how important it's going to be for everyone to sacrifice something of themselves for the greater good,” Amaker said. “The kids have been incredibly receptive of that word.”
For the Crimson, sacrifice starts from the top down with co-captains Curry and Laurent Rivard. Along with Casey, Curry took a year off from school in connection with the Government 1310 scandal, got a job, and was forced to watch from afar as his teammates took the program to heights it had never before reached. Rivard, the team’s third-leading scorer from last year, will likely lose his spot in the starting backcourt with the return of Curry, but recognizes the quality up and down the lineup as unmistakably positive.
“Coach [Amaker] made it clear early that we have a lot of good players and a lot of talent, and we need to stay in our roles and share the floor,” Rivard said. “We have new players and a lot of players who played a lot when [Casey and Curry] weren’t there, so we are deeper.”
In a nod to this talent, Harvard was the unanimous selection to finish atop the league in the 2013-14 Ivy League preseason poll, the first team to receive that honor since the aforementioned Cornell team in 2009. Part of this is due to the perceived lack of a legitimate rival. Princeton, last year’s conference runner-up, must deal with the graduation of 2012-13 Ivy Player of the Year Ian Hummer. Penn and Yale, picked to finish second and third in the conference, respectively, might stand the best chance of dethroning the Crimson, returning most of their teams that both finished in the top half of the league a season ago.
“It’s assumed that whoever is the favorite is supposed to waltz through the league, but it's never happened since I've been a part of it,” Amaker said.
Before the opening of Ivy play, Harvard must negotiate through a few tricky non-conference contests. Over Thanksgiving weekend, the Crimson will travel to Anchorage, Alaska to take part in the Great Alaska Shootout. On its way out west, Harvard will make a stop in Boulder to take on Colorado, a team that received comparable amounts of votes in preseason Top 25 polls. The Crimson’s biggest test outside of the league will be its annual date with No. 18/19 Connecticut, the only ranked team currently on Harvard’s schedule.
Then comes the 14-game tournament that is the Ivy schedule, a series of grueling weekends with back-to-back games on Fridays and Saturdays, all of which Harvard will likely be favored to win. Slipups like last year’s loss at Columbia and near-defeats at home against Dartmouth and Brown will bring extra scrutiny, despite coming with the territory of playing in what Amaker terms a “bear” of a conference.
The weight of all these expectations, where anything but a record-setting season might be viewed as a step backward, could either suffocate a team or serve as motivation, but Amaker has chosen a third path for Harvard: to ignore them entirely.
“We have our set identity, our set standards, and our set goals—they don't change,” Amaker said. “Our players know them by heart, and we don't compromise or negotiate with those three categories. Those are internal for us, and we’re never really worried or focusing or trying to listen to anything from the outside world.”

I recently began to take note of some of the more ridiculous things that people in and around Harvard Yard say when they think a Flyby writer isn’t skulking behind them. The following are completely real and completely ridiculous things that you should NEVER do:
Humble brag about your SAT scores.“No. I didn’t get the highest SAT score in my grade. But the kid who did is at Stanford now.” He wasn’t bragging about being the best at something, so it’s ok. Right? Wrong. Unfortunately, this humble brag isn’t all that humble and isn’t actually something worth bragging about.
 
Lip-sync to your iPod while on a treadmill.People do unattractive enough things while exercising—we don’t want to see you do your best Billy Idol impression on top of that.
 
Walk with your significant other while both of you have your hands down (the back of) the other’s pants.I kid you not. This was by far the most aggressive PDA that I’ve ever seen—we don’t need or want to see that. One a separate note, how do you pull that off for extended periods of time? Doesn’t walking up stairs get weird? Just hold hands or something.
Have an outdated Top 40 song as your ringtone.That was cool when people found out that you could have songs for ringtones on a flip phone. But then 2007 happened. The song really isn’t popular anymore. You also might have your ringer up too loud to be in public. And, to be honest, I just don’t want to hear “Wild Ones” as I’m ordering too many Insomnia cookies at 12:15 on a Wednesday morning.
Wear pants with two different colored legs.Hipster nonsense at its finest. To your credit, they were corduroy pants. Less to your credit, one leg was orange and the other one was blue. Also, I think they were the tightest pants I have ever seen (although it seems like that record is overtaken every additional week I spend in Cambridge).
 
Say this to a tourist (or anyone else, for that matter).“Well. Here at Harvard we call them concentrations. But I guess you could say I’m an Econ major.” We know that it’s a tough pill to swallow, but most people don’t know or care about the distinction between a major and a concentration. So just be nice. Answer the question. Make it seem as though nice people actually go here.
Pat John Harvard’s foot at 1 a.m. on a Saturday, then point to him and give him the bro nod.I laughed out loud when I saw this. Honestly? No further explanation. Classic freshman mistake.

Remember when you used to dream about going to Harvard? About eating in Annenberg, living in a beautiful, bell-towered House on the river, and learning from Nobel Prize-winning professors? Now that you’ve been here a while, you’ve no doubt learned that (spoiler alert) Annenberg isn’t actually Hogwarts, that the River Houses have cockroaches, and that you’ll spend as much time learning from graduate students as you do from the likes of Karplus and Mankiw. But never fear, Harvard TFs tend to be amazing—and just as diverse as Harvard students. Here are the five-and-a-half types of teaching fellows you’ll have at Harvard:
The one who’s obsessed with his thesis: You thought you were taking an introduction to statistics. But introduction to statistics is boring, isn’t it? Wouldn’t you much rather learn about Asymptotic Properties of the Chi Squared Test? This TF thinks you would. In fact, this TF will spend so much time talking about his thesis that come finals, you’ll accidentally write a paper on it rather than the actual course subject.
 
The one who’s in love with the professor: This TF is also great, because this is her eighth year serving as a teaching fellow for this course. And no, she’s not just really passionate about introductory economics. What she is really passionate about? Your professor.
 
The one who’s a better teacher than the teacher: This TF is young, energetic, and can explain string theory in a way that’s almost as entertaining as Breaking Bad. While your professor has a Nobel Prize in Physics, your TF deserves one in communicating to under-rested and over-caffeinated college students.
 
The one you’re in love with: He wears glasses, has his own apartment, and can recite Rousseau’s Social Contract from memory... in French. What more could a girl ask for? You normally exploit Harvard time, but for this class, you still arrive on the hour to every section just to spend those extra seven heavenly minutes with this TF.
 
The one who’s younger than you: You’ve heard a lot about young, Harvard prodigies. In fact, you’ve even seen a few on Oprah. Well now, you get the chance to learn from one! Despite being a 22-year-old senior with a job lined up at Bain, you’re about to spend an entire semester learning about economics from a 16-year-old freshman. But hey, nothing like a lesson in humility to send you off into the real world!
 
The preceptor: This may or may not be a TF. No one’s quite sure.
