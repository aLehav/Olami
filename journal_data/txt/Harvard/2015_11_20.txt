After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the days following the attacks in Paris, the issue of refugees fleeing from ISIS has been debated vigorously on a national stage. More than half of the nation's governors have stated their unwillingness to accept refugees in their states (despite their lack of authority to dictate immigration policy); the House of Representatives voted yesterday to impose stricter screening procedures on Syrian refugees seeking resettlement. Terrorist attacks are often inflection points; the reactions to such attacks reveal much about the countries forced to respond. Today, we as a nation are faced with a choice: We can respond with either compassion or fear. We must resist the temptation of the latter.
It is easy, in the wake of the terror wrought on Paris, to react from a place of irrational fear and prevent refugees from entering the country under any circumstances. Unfortunately, closing ranks against those fleeing the Islamic State—the same organization that the United States is fighting against—does nothing except generate resentment against the US. If the Western world is unwilling to take in Syrian refugees, IS can then shape the narrative by claiming to be the only option available. Clearly, this outcome is not preferable. Instead, we ought to act with compassion; we must acknowledge that these refugees are fleeing from those who would threaten and attack us.
Unfortunately, inflammatory reactions to the crisis are politically effective. It is much simpler to support a ban against refugees than to understand the realities of a complex situation. The current process of screening a potential refugee already takes nearly two years; of the nearly 750,000 refugees admitted to the United States since 9/11, not one has been arrested on domestic terror charges; only two have been arrested for aiding al-Qaeda at home. Those advocating for keeping refugees out of the country base their arguments on mistaken ideas about the characteristics of refugees or Islam in general—the terrorists who attacked Paris are not representative of all Muslims.
Of course, this is not a call to waive the screening process; it is undoubtedly important to retain the screening measures that we currently have in place. Some governors have voiced a desire to postpone the accepting of refugees pending a review of federal security procedures and clearances. Given President Obama’s push to resettle an increased number of Syrian refugees (ten thousand over the next year, compared to 2,159 in the past four years), ensuring that the process is secure and effective is vital. However, the bill passed by the House, which requires each Syrian and Iraqi applicant to be cleared by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and the director of national intelligence, is a step too far, imposing requirements that are entirely unreasonable.
Moreover, we are deeply disappointed in the Republican candidates who have advocated for denying entry to Muslims. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush’s response has been especially perplexing, as he has turned back on his initial broad support in a capitulation to the pressures of partisan politics. It is important to note that this xenophobic behavior is not just limited to the Republican Party; Democrats too have contemplated a “pause” on resettlement, and voted for the House bill.
The next few weeks will determine how the United States responds to this crisis. The United States has always represented a better life for those fleeing persecution. In light of the conflict in Syria, we hope that our nation again fulfills that promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last October, LVMH allocated $143 million to found a private museum of contemporary art for its Louis Vuitton Foundation, and commissioned architect Frank Gehry to design and construct it in Paris’s Bois de Boulogne. Even for the multinational conglomerate that runs Louis Vuitton, Moët, Hennessy, and 66 other luxury goods companies—all of which you’ve definitely heard of—this is a considerable investment worth investigating.
What merits a price tag of $143 million? In part, social capital. When prompted to explain why he wished to open the Louis Vuitton Foundation, Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, said, “We wanted to present Paris with an extraordinary space for art and culture, and demonstrate daring and emotion by entrusting Frank Gehry with the construction of an iconic building for the 21st century.” Indeed, Arnault was able to successfully build his museum on a plot of land that had previously been denied to several other land developers. While these competitors wished to construct office buildings and business centers, Arnault was granted control of the land because his proposition was deemed to be a noble endeavor to create a public work.
But in a city that already boasts high concentrations of both art and culture, this was an ambitious—maybe even superfluous—undertaking.
It’s clear to me that the goal of creating a rich, new ground for cultural discovery was only of secondary importance to Arnault. Though the museum has staged several provoking shows recently, in its opening weeks it showed nothing more than a condensed version of Arnault’s private collection.
Rather, Bernard Arnault invested almost $1.5 million in his own brand by reinvigorating the name of Louis Vuitton and thus claiming ownership of the art world in the name of high fashion.
It is no secret that newer fashion labels have begun to outmode Louis Vuitton, the oldest member of the LVMH conglomerate. In tying the brand’s name to a new museum that is sleek, beautiful, and houses millions of dollars worth of art, Arnault intended to reposition and revive the label.
Indeed, the curatorial board explains that their initial goal was not necessarily to draw crowds to the museum’s art, but rather to its stunning architecture. That is to say, the artwork created by third parties was at first marketed as less important than the architectural artwork, commissioned by LVMH and bearing the name of one of its child companies.
In so doing, the museum has begun to focus more on mounting provoking art shows, borrowing important works from other famous institutions all over the world. Fashion-Arbiter Arnault has thus established, to some extent, that couture tastemakers are akin to their fine arts counterparts.
In fact, Arnault isn’t alone in his ambitiously successful antics. And in the case of Miuccia Prada—the creative director behind the brands Prada and Miu Miu—the endeavor does not stem from a need to reposition her brands at all.
A long-time art collector and enthusiast, Prada’s decision to open the Fondazione Prada museum derives simply from a confidence in her own taste in fine art as a designer of fine clothing. In tandem with her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, and architect Rem Koolhaas, she has spent the past seven years designing a campus of ten buildings that boasts over 120,000 square feet of exhibition space; an innovative mixture of dilapidated, ancient aesthetic and modern, minimalist architecture; and amenities like a state-of-the-art movie theater, courtyard, restaurant, and an outdoor pavilion for temporary exhibitions.
It is no surprise that arbiters of haute couture taste successfully intermingle the worlds of high fashion clothing and fine art. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, there exists an entire subdivision dedicated to doing just that. The Metropolitan’s Costume Institute, in tandem with Anna Wintour, mounts a humongous fashion exhibit each year that blurs the line between fashion and fine art in much the same way. In 2011, the museum launched its exhibit in honor of designer Alexander McQueen, and when the exhibit singlehandedly attracted more foot traffic than any other in the museum’s history, it was clear that museumgoers and fashionistas alike had been aching to see the two industries overlap.
Though endeavors like these legitimize fashion as a mode of artistic production, they also render haute couture inaccessible to the masses. Museums showcase things that are untouchable, difficult to parse, and furthermore things that cannot be owned. Though naming a museum of contemporary art after Louis Vuitton ties the brand to culture, the effect is more complex.
Additionally, museums physically separate consumers from clothing. Though I’m already alienated by the four-figured price tag on a Chanel dress, I feel even more unworthy of owning it when that dress must be protected from my touch by glass cases and security ropes.
Though I seriously believe that fashion belongs in museums, it seems that this is not the most effective marketing tactic. However, there does seem to be a way to create museums solely dedicated to clothes that is not alienating, but rather inviting.
Valentino Garavani, owner and designer of the eponymous high-end label, has done so by founding a museum that won’t cost him any overhead. In 2011, Garavani and his partner Giancarlo Giammetti launched the Valentino Garavani Virtual Museum, a website and accompanying downloadable applet that provides viewers with unlimited, free access to 50 years of the label’s haute couture archives. Featuring cutting-edge, immersive 3-D, the virtual museum allows anyone to interactively explore over 5,000 dresses—their cut, materials, history, and production information.
In comparison to the Louis Vuitton Foundation, Valentino’s virtual gallery seems much more honest. LVMH’s new museum may indeed be a beautiful gift to the art world and a lovely amenity for Parisians, but as a surreptitious marketing attempt, it is ultimately nothing more than sponsored content. And while The Fondazione Prada purports only to add to its foundress’s empire, I’m interested to see how its opening affects the revenue of the clothing brand that bears her name.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’m tired.
At the beginning of the year, coming back to campus after a semester away seemed simultaneously exciting and daunting. Perhaps as a coping mechanism, I started jokingly referring to myself as a Tired Old Queen, and I laughed as the term caught on among my first-year mentees in FUP.
Tired Old Queens are a reclamation of the Senior Washed Up Girl, or SWUG. Tired Old Queens drink wine on weekdays. Tired Old Queens deadpan incisive commentary in section without regard for relevancy to the readings. Tired Old Queens are excited for Harvard-Yale because it means getting brunch with their Yale counterparts while everyone else stands in the cold. Tired Old Queens dress however they want—whether that’s sweatpants on a Friday or heels on a Wednesday.
As a self-identified TOQ, I’m down with all that. But this begs questioning: Why are we Tired Old Queens so tired in the first place? What does it mean that my senior year is the most exhausting of my four years at this place?
Being a senior means that I’ve spent nearly four years on this campus watching people run themselves into the ground, letting themselves get sick, and forcing themselves to continue onward until they can’t anymore. I watch people take mental health leaves each semester, and then I wonder why I stick around at a place that does such a great job of chipping away at our wellness.
Of course, Harvard is a place of prestige. That’s why we stick around. We all worked ourselves too hard to get here, and we’re not supposed to criticize it. We’ve toiled our way to royal ranks, dining and sleeping in the same halls as presidents and senators and billionaires. The enclosed spaces that we occupy every day are spaces that weren’t built for someone like me, but perhaps I’m still supposed to be grateful for them.
My point in reflecting on my own tiredness is not to evaluate how grateful I should be to Harvard. I’m grateful to my admissions officer and fortune for getting me in the door. I’m grateful for my single mom who always found a way to drive me to rehearsals, Model United Nations conferences, and my high school job, until I got my license and we started to share the family minivan. I’m grateful for the teachers at my high school who encouraged me to apply to my dream school in the first place—and yes, Harvard was, of course, my dream school.
But just because Harvard was—and is—my dream school, that doesn’t mean that my gratefulness can’t be accompanied by some deeper existential exhaustion. What does it mean that I’m at a place that wouldn’t have let me attend its all male college for the majority of its existence? What does it mean that Harvard’s female counterpart, Radcliffe, didn’t have any black graduates for the first 20 years of its existence? I’ve spent a lot of time and energy working through questions like that, as well as other questions that are hard to answer. Why was I not connected to punch processes as a sophomore? Why was I excluded from the very process of attempting to access female social spaces? Why did I have to organize hundreds of fellow students to prove to the administration that gender-inclusive housing options were not just a student priority, but a necessity? Why is it that I constantly feel like I’m put on the spot to speak for people of color, women, or queer people on the “hot topics” in the news relating to these identity groups? Why do I have to be the one explaining to fellow students that sometimes the issue isn’t free speech or protest tactics, but rather, my ability to exist on this campus without constantly feeling obligated to prove my worth?
In a recent article for The New Yorker, Jelani Cobb explains it: “The freedom to offend the powerful is not equivalent to the freedom to bully the relatively disempowered.” I’m not trying to frame myself as a disempowered individual. I’m simply saying that it’s exhausting to be on a campus where people’s definitions of liberal fairness are often asserted by individuals who are unaware of their own biased or unfair assumptions. I’m tired of being at a place that wasn’t built for me, trying to explain to people that we cannot take for granted the seemingly value-neutral ways that Harvard works. Examining the relative powerlessness of our Undergraduate Council or the relative power of our House masters seem like two good places to start.
I’ve “grown up” in these four years, whatever that means. I’ve grown to fit the title of Tired Old Queen, aged by the institution but also by my own changing perceptions of it. Learning that change often comes too slowly was hard. Even harder: learning that this is an environment of too much competition and too little empathy, built on the assumed homogeny of “Harvard men,” the labor of slaves, and the aggressive insensitivity of former institutional leaders. Where do those legacies leave me?
Janelle Monae’s song “Q.U.E.E.N” comes to mind when someone asks me why I identify as a TOQ instead of a SWUG. What intellectual work am I doing by calling myself a Tired Old Queen? I’m asserting myself as a woman (and not just a girl!) worthy of royal attention in the halls of American elites, redefining myself as someone who is allowed to make space in my life for resting. To my fellow TOQs on this campus, don’t let anyone take away your royalty.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Law School crest is a glorification of and a memorial to one of the largest and most brutal slave owners in Massachusetts. But Isaac Royall, Jr., was more than simply a slave owner; he was complicit in torture and in a gruesome conflagration wherein 77 black human beings were burned alive. This fact and others were absent from The Crimson’s recent editorial, “Recognizing History”—an erasure of history that shows precisely why the seal must be changed. Now that the Law School has been subject to an act of racism, we feel that it is more important than ever to bring this history to light. As the students of Royall Must Fall, we call on the Law School to confront and address this history, not to sanitize and ignore it.
According to C.S. Manegold’s Ten Hills Farm, among other sources, Isaac Royall’s family owned a sugar plantation in Antigua, one of the most notorious strongholds of the slave trade. In the mid 1730’s, a string of natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and a drought made water scarce on the island. According to Law School professor Daniel R. Coquillette, in Antigua it is said that water was commonly given to the livestock before it was given to the men and women from Africa who were forced to work in the cane fields.
Driven to desperation by starvation and thirst, these brave people made a plan to rebel for their freedom in 1736. The Royall family helped to foil that plan and together with the white, landowning government, they decided to force them into submission. The family and other landowners burned 77 human beings at the stake, including Hector, the Royall family’s head slave. Six people were hanged and five people were broken on the wheel.
The “breaking wheel” is often forgotten in the retelling of this story. It was a medieval torture device used on plantations where human beings were strapped to a wheel as an executioner crushed every bone in their body, starting with the fingers and toes and working inwards. Once this process was complete, the victim was crucified on the wheel until he bled to death, slowly over hours or days. His body would then be put on display until it rotted away, as a symbol to the enslaved people not to question the Royalls and other slave lords.
The Royall family took the money it made in Antigua and moved to Medford, where they became the largest slave owners in Massachusetts. In 1781, Royall Jr. died and part of his estate was bequeathed to Harvard to found a chair in the study of law, physics, or anatomy. Thus his vast family wealth, accumulated by the broken, beaten, bruised and burned backs of black laborers, provided the nest egg for the Law School.
It was also only in 1936—not at the Law School’s inception—that we adopted the Royall family coat of arms as the crest. The Law School made a choice then to celebrate Isaac Royall Jr.’s place in its history, and we can make a choice now to change that elevation to a memorial plaque or portrait in the library of Royall and the enslaved people who actually founded this school. We are not asking our community to forget what the Royalls did.
Changing the seal does not take us further away from history. It shows that we truly understand that history and grasp the deep, immoral significance of racism, slavery, torture, and mass murder. The murder, torture, and exploitation of the slave trade should not be sanitized because it created racial inequality in the present. The continuing oppression of black lives in the United States is a direct result of the brutal history of the slave trade, and something that we have continuously failed to address.
It is appropriate and important that we examine those we glorify on all our symbols. Symbols are an expression of who we are as a community, and who we are today is inextricably linked to our history. Symbols that memorialize people like Royall sanitize our history of slavery. If the Law School does not confront its history, then it is contributing to a continuing culture of subjugation and oppression.
The use of this crest does nothing to enhance diversity and inclusion of minority groups on the Law School campus—a purported goal of this institution. Indeed, to declare that the Law School has made enough progress, to proclaim that the mere admission of minority students is enough, constitutes a failure to recognize the inherent indignity in being obliged to adopt as your own the symbol of a family who might have owned your ancestors. It is yet another manifestation of the failure to recognize that black lives matter.
This important phrase raises a key question: Why worry about a seal when minorities face deadly violence in the streets of our country every day? Because as law students, we see the connection between our history and the laws that justify deadly police violence against black and brown bodies. We recognize the connection between the Law School and the ongoing justification of racial disparities in nearly every quality of life metric in the United States. We see the connection between symbols of oppression and the continuing marginalization of black and brown students.
And finally, we recognize that it is no longer enough to declare allegiance to diversity by merely admitting minorities. In other words, the mere admission of minorities can no longer be called “progress.” Now it is time to start actually including minorities in the governance of our institutions. This means “decolonizing” our institutions of higher education – that is, reforming our physical and intellectual spaces so that they no longer burden minority students with constant reminders of their historical, legal, and ongoing social subjugation. The Royall crest is merely one aspect of this broader justice project in creating an inclusive community. And it is only the beginning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black tape, stuck systematically across the portraits of black law professors, spurred on Thursday a police investigation into vandalism and a pronouncement from the dean of Harvard Law School that the school has a “serious problem” with racism.
Law School students and teachers who walked into Harvard’s Wasserstein Hall on Thursday morning found pieces of black tape covering some of the faculty portraits that hang on walls inside the building—specifically on the faces of black professors depicted there.
The incident prompted outrage from Law School students who were quick to condemn it as racist vandalism, and police are now investigating.
Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano said Thursday evening that the investigation is “active and ongoing,” and although he declined to comment further, Law School Dean Martha L. Minow wrote in a statement that police are investigating the incident as a hate crime.
Law School professor Charles J. Ogletree, whose portrait was among those vandalized, said he was still waiting to learn more about the incident before making too strong of a judgement.
“We’re just trying to figure out what happened and why someone targeted black faculty,” Ogletree said.
Still, among students and other Law School affiliates reacting to the incident on Thursday, many condemned it through posts on social media and formal and informal gatherings on campus.
Leland S. Shelton, the president of the Harvard Black Law Student Association, described it as “actually one of the most clear-cut, overt instances of very, very vile and disrespectful behavior from somebody”; second-year Law School student Michele D. Hall, who posted photographs of the vandalized portraits in a post on the website Blavity, wrote, “This morning at Harvard Law School we woke up to a hate crime.”
After the tape was removed from the portraits, students posted notes with words of support for the black professors alongside their photographs.
And at noon on Thursday, hundreds of Law School students, faculty, staff, and administrators filled Milstein Hall East, where students took to microphones, some describing the Law School as a sometimes racist and unwelcoming environment. Some student speakers directly criticized Minow, arguing that she does not do enough to support minority students.  

Minow, for her part, was direct in acknowledging what she described as the existence of racism at Harvard when prompted by a student. “Racism exists in America and in the United States and in Harvard and in Harvard Law School,” Minow said. “I am on record; this is my work. This is what I do.”
Further prodded by students’ questions, Minow said racism is a “serious problem” at her school.
The incident and subsequent hate crime allegations follows incidents at Yale and the University of Missouri at Columbia that have prompted protests against racism at colleges across the country, including a march and rally at Harvard on Wednesday.
It also comes as a group of Harvard Law School students who call themselves Royall Must Fall has requested the removal of the school’s seal because it features the crest of a family that owned slaves.
That group of students denounced the vandalism as “an overt act of racial hatred” in an open letter published in the Harvard Law Record, a student publication. They also claimed in their letter that the Thursday incident could be a reaction to their activism: They had placed several pieces of black tape over several depictions of the school’s seal around campus on Wednesday night, they wrote, alleging that someone had removed those pieces of tape and then placed them on the portraits of black faculty members.
Aside from that claim, some other Law School students responded to the incident with criticisms of the environment at Harvard specifically and said they hope the school will do more to support minority students going forward.
“For a lot of students, particularly students of color, it’s not surprising. It’s just more public,” Law student Derecka M. Purnell said. “It’s a public manifestation of what we experience in the classroom every day.”
Minow, responding to criticisms in an emailed statement, wrote that she has met with student advocacy groups and that she “look[s] forward to working still more with them and others towards finding effective solutions to the problems that persist in our community and, more broadly, in a society that still doesn't deliver on its promises to so many of our fellow citizens.”
While the incident took place at the Law School, students and administrators across other parts of Harvard also reacted to the event, many distressed and concerned.
At the College, Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 and upperclassman House masters sent emails to undergraduates denouncing the vandalism. Van Bailey, the College’s director of BGLTQ student life, also attended the Law School’s town hall meeting to show support for other Harvard affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 19, 2015, at 11:05 p.m.
 Recounting emotional stories of sexual assault, more than 80 undergraduates convened outside Massachusetts Hall on Thursday afternoon to call on the College to commit more resources and attention to preventing sexual assaults on campus.
Bearing signs with the slogans reading, “we all deserve to be safe” and “our voices are strong and we will be heard,” undergraduates recounted experiences of sexual violence at Harvard. As students criticized administrators’ response to rape on campus, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana stood and listened.
The rally came at a time when university sexual assault prevention policies are under intense scrutiny nationally and at Harvard in particular. In July 2014, Harvard announced an overhaul to its policies. In April 2014, the federal government launched an investigation into the College’s compliance with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX. This fall the results of a survey of undergraduates indicated levels of sexual assault at Harvard that administrators deemed “troubling.”
 At Thursday’s protests, students said Harvard should require mandatory yearly sexual assault training for undergraduates, increase funding for the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response by 50 percent, and require additional training for sexual violence response tutors in upperclassman Houses. Protesters said administrators needed to meet their demands by the start of the spring semester.
Undergraduates took to a megaphone in the heart of Harvard Yard to heighten the pressure on administrators to respond to sexual assaults on campus. Passing off a megaphone to speakers standing on the grass outside Mass Hall—home to central administrative offices including University President Drew G. Faust’s—several undergraduates recounted, often with detail, their experiences with sexual violence.
Viviana I. Maymi ’16, the author of a recent op-ed in The Crimson called “Here’s How I Was Raped,” spoke at the event.
“I have realized that in living my day to day life, I show courage,” said Maymi, one of the rally’s organizers. “I refuse to let that dictate my life.”
As undergraduates finished giving their accounts of jarring experiences of sexual violence, they joined the crowd in chanting, “Blame the system, not the victim.” 
 
Rachel C. Talamo ’18, the author of a recent op-ed about sexual assault in The Crimson, said she was sexually assaulted and described how her friends failed to support her after the incident.
“We need you to listen to us when we tell you what we need,” Talamo said to the crowd.
Pausing intermittently, Megan G. Jones ’16 recited a number of anonymous submissions that depicted harrowing accounts of sexual assault and criticized how University administrators responded. As Jones recounted it, a student criticized how a College sexual assault and sexual harassment tutor responded to a report of sexual assault. Other anonymous submissions described the emotional and physical toll sexual assault had, and how their friends and supporters failed to support them.
“Sometimes when there isn’t a bomb threat I still feel unsafe,” said Andrea Ortiz ’16, another one of the rally’s organizers. “We are at war, and the battle will not be over until all of our voices are heard.”
The rally comes in the wake of the release of the University’s sexual misconduct survey, which showed that 31 percent of female College seniors surveyed had experienced some kind of sexual misconduct during their time at Harvard. The survey also found that many undergraduate respondents lacked confidence in Harvard’s response to sexual assault on campus.
“All semester, this topic has been at the forefront of the conversation,” Maymi said, but she criticized administrators for not implementing changes like the ones outlined in organizers’ petitions.
“We ask Harvard to be accountable to student and survivor voices and needs,” said Jessica R. Fournier '17, an organizer for the anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better. “They are failing to support survivors.”
Several administrators, including Khurana and Mather House Dean Luke Leafgren, attended the event. Leafgren and other speakers argued for the importance of administrators responding to student concerns, although he acknowledged that the pace of tangible change is often slow.
“It’s really important that survivors have their voice heard,” said Alicia Oeser, the director of Harvard’s Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 20, 2015, at 3:56 a.m.
Shaiba Rather ’17 and Daniel V. Banks ’17 edged out two other tickets to clinch the Undergraduate Council presidency and vice presidency in an election with the lowest undergraduate voter turnout since 2011.
Rather and Banks garnered 1,336, or about 46 percent of first-choice votes in the election, while William A. Greenlaw ’17 and William F. Morris IV ’17 seized 1,087. The third ticket, Nick E. Gajdzik ’16-’17 and Jeffrey M. Ott ’16-’17, received 348 votes, according to UC Election Commission chair Matthew C. Estes ’18.
Fewer than 2,900 undergraduates voted in the election, a turnout considerably lower than the 3,348 votes cast in last year’s election, and the lowest since 2011, Estes said.
Undergraduates also voted on two referenda questions. A UC-proposed referendum that asked students whether or not Pusey Library should be turned into a “freshmen-oriented social space” failed by a wide margin, with 56 percent of votes cast in opposition. Seventy-six percent of voters approved a second question that calls on administrators to open Harvard’s sexual assault policy task force meetings to all interested students.
Neither results, however, will become the official stance of the UC, because fewer than half of undergraduates voted in the election. A turnout of at least 3,341 were needed for the results to be binding.
The winning leadership candidates, who are both one-year UC veterans and the current co-chairs of its Student Initiatives Committee, will assume office in December. Rather and Banks ran on a platform that called to “open Harvard” by focusing on social spaces, mental health resources, and sexual assault, among other points in their three-pronged platform.
Voting in the UC’s presidential election ended at 9 p.m. on Thursday evening, after the voting period was extended by several hours in response to a bomb threat that scattered Harvard Yard on Monday and after the voting system experienced technical difficulties. Rather’s ticket led vote counts throughout the four-day election, from Monday to Thursday evening, Estes wrote.
Rather and Banks will likely have to lobby Harvard administrators to provide the student body with centralized social spaces, increased resources for mental health, and sexual assault prevention programs—three issues that characterized this year’s election season and have recently dominated campus discourse. Some particulars of their platform, including a goal to place an undergraduate on the University’s Board of Overseers and open up the selection processes of private final clubs, will likely prove challenging to implement.
At about 10:15 p.m., the Council’s current president and vice president, Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and Dhruv P. Goyal ’16, notified the winners at a jubilant campaign party in Winthrop House. Close to tears, Rather and Banks thanked their campaign supporters and vowed to implement their platform next year.
“It’s pretty surreal. It feels weird to finally have the opportunity to do something and to do Harvard like we’ve been talking about,” Rather said, minutes after learning that she would take the helm of the UC.
Banks stressed the initiatives he and Rather outlined in the campaign and various debates, arguing that the pair will strive to achieve them.
“It’s made me realize how the issues that people care about are really personal, not just political,” Banks said.
Greenlaw and Morris appeared to keep an optimistic tone late Thursday evening, emphasizing avenues for advocacy despite their loss.
“At the end of the day, this isn’t really about the UC. The UC is just a convenient conduit for the change that we want to be able to see,” Greenlaw said. “So even if we aren't the UC’s president and vice president-elect, there’s still a lot of work to be done, and I’m committed to helping do that."
Morris said he ran for the UC to devote attention to destigmatizing student discussions of mental health, an issue that he and Greenlaw emphasized throughout the election season.
Gajdzik and Ott could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a week when the terrorist attacks in Paris dominated the news, Harvard psychology professor Steven A. Pinker’s remarks Thursday may have surprised some of his listeners. Violence, he said, has been declining continuously over the course of human history and will continue to fall in the future.
“The news is a systematically misleading way to understand the current state of the world,” said Pinker, a professor of Psychology, during a talk to about 100 people. He referenced the “if it bleeds, it leads” principle of news coverage and how it can lead to an excessive focus on violent events. 
“Over the course of history, our institutions and societal norms have brought about our better angels,” said Pinker, citing both a famous Abraham Lincoln quote and the title of his 2010 book The Better Angels of Our Nature.
Pinker theorized that our “better angels” include facets of human emotion such as self-control, empathy, moral sense and reason. These feelings, according to Pinker, have led to global decreases in war, slavery, the death penalty, and homicide.
Organized by student group Harvard College Effective Altruism, the lecture packed dozens of students and community members into Emerson Hall 210. Some were drawn by the name of one of Harvard’s most famous professors.
“I loved it. I thought he was amazing,” Ashley D. Anderson ‘19 said. “I wanted to hear him speak because I’m really interested in psychology.”
Harvard Effective Altruism, one of Harvard’s newer student organizations, promotes the use of data and reasoning in decision-making.
“[Effective altruism] is a widespread and growing movement, particularly on a lot of college campuses,” said Lily H. Zhang ’17, an organizer of the event. “We do a lot with holding lectures like this with people like Stephen Pinker” who believe in the principles the group espouses, she said.
Pinker began the lecture discussing the brutal and often deadly violence that occurred in the prehistoric period and early portions of recorded history. “Our species has what you may call a history of violence,” he said.
Pinker zoomed through thousands of years, outlining six major declines in violence. He called one of the events “the Civilization Process," in which early kings and emperors "tried to stamp out endemic feuding in the territories that they pacified,” he said.
Current events, according to Pinker, are a mix of good news and bad news. “In the past year, we have seen the violence perpetrated by [the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria], wars in Ukraine, and riots and violence in the streets of the United States,” he said.
However, he urged the audience to look past the 24-hour news cycle when making judgments about the world.
Ending on a positive note, Pinker asserted that the global decline in violence will continue. “Some forms of violence, once abolished, stay abolished,” he said. “The world has become more democratic than ever.”

Fully decked in crimson and chanting “Beat Yale!” thousands of Harvard students will make the journey to New Haven this weekend for The Game, the biggest event on the fall semester’s social calendar. But not everyone is leaving Cambridge.
“I'm not going because, to be honest, I don't even know how football works,” Rebecca Hernandez ’19 said. “Plus, the $40 for the shuttle, I'd rather spend it on clothes and food.” The Harvard Student Agencies’ Harvard-Yale shuttle service charges $40 to $50 for a round-trip ticket, depending on the time of arrival and departure. 
Hernandez still plans to travel this weekend. Rather than a two-hour bus ride, she will be taking a 20-minute T ride into downtown Boston to shop with a couple of friends.
Other students, like Nathan L. Williams ’18, who works for WHRB 95.3 FM, the Harvard student radio station, have responsibilities on campus that prevent them from going to The Game.
“I work with studio engineering and the news department. On Saturday, I'll be compiling Sunday's show as well as organizing old news archives,” Williams said.
Other Harvard organizations are also holding events this weekend that require members to stay on campus. The Harvard-Radcliffe Kendo Club is sponsoring a Kendo training camp for students from Keio University in Tokyo, Japan, and some members need to stay on campus to host the visitors.
Daniel Shen ’19, one of the hosts, said he wasn’t disappointed. “[The Game] will probably be better on home soil next year,” he said.
In addition to her on-campus responsibilities and an overload of classwork, Arlesia McGowan ’19 cited the amount of planning required before going to Yale as one of the main reasons she will be staying behind.
“Initially, I was going to [attend], but because of lack of preparation on my part, I decided not to. I would have to stay overnight or pay for a hotel, and I didn’t want to do that,” she said.
Andrew D. Hayes ’17 is staying at Harvard to cover shifts at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter, which he said was a welcome alternative to going to The Game. “I am not going to Harvard-Yale because I went freshman year and don't feel like I need to go again,” he said.

Prominent female entrepreneurs discussed their experiences leading businesses at a speaker series for Women’s Entrepreneurship Day on Thursday evening.
Hosted by the Harvard Extension Entrepreneurship and Real Estate Association, the event featured four female entrepreneurs who spoke about their companies and personal business ventures. In her presentation to an audience of around 100, Dina Dwyer-Owens, co-chair of franchise holding company Dwyer Group, emphasized the importance of business values and advocated for continuous self-improvement.
“I really want to inspire people to take responsibility for having clarity about their personal values,” Dwyer-Owens said prior to the event.
In her speech, Dwyer-Owens discussed the history of her company, which she inherited from her father, and how they built it into a billion-dollar business. Dwyer-Owens then outlined the guiding principles of her company and showed clips of her appearance on the CBS show “Undercover Bosses” to demonstrate how she takes responsibility for her business policies.
“[Business is] not about money. It’s about how we treat people,” Dwyer-Owens said. “The profits are simply the applause we get for doing right by taking care of people.”
Conference organizers Ruxanda Krekeler, Harvard Extension Entrepreneurship and Real Estate Association events coordinator, and Aksinia S. Stavskaya, the Boston ambassador of Women’s Entrepreneurship Day, said they hope the event will inspire current and future business women.
“I really want [the audience] to know that there are so many women entrepreneurs. We face the same barriers in our businesses,” Stavskaya said. “I want them to feel inspired, to feel strong, to feel like together we can do things and grow.”
An internationally recognized movement sponsored by the United Nations, the Women’s Entrepreneurship Day aims to empower women in business worldwide. Stavskaya said that her position as an ambassador to the movement gives her the unique opportunity to meet and collaborate with entrepreneurs.
“Being able to bring [entrepreneurs] all together to empower each other…I feel this amazing strength,” Stavskaya said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks before last year’s Harvard-Yale clash, a crew from ESPN visited Cambridge to scout out possible locations for College GameDay, the sports network’s premier college football show. It was a big moment for Harvard athletics, a chance for its program to secure unprecedented visibility on a show watched by millions of fans and potential recruits.
Midway through the visit, prospects looked grim. First, the visitors checked out Ohiri Field, but the head cameraman found it to be too far from Harvard Stadium. Next they tried O’Donnell Field, but the view of the stadium was not ideal. Finally, Harvard athletics officials brought the crew to the Dillon Quad, which Associate Director of Athletics Tim Williamson described as their “last resort.” 
When they arrived at the quad last year, Associate Director of Athletic Communications Alison Miller noticed a change in the crew. “The guy walked in, and his jaw just dropped,” she said.
“I knew that moment we were going to get it,” Williamson said.
Now, a year later, the legacy of hosting ESPN’s flagship college football show—and the months-long campaign to bring the show to campus—still affects Harvard athletics. According to Williamson and Harvard football coach Tim Murphy, the show has delivered lasting benefits to the department. Most significantly, these include a boost to recruiting efforts.
“I hope that two or three years from now people can look back and coaches can say, ‘That was helpful’,” Williamson said. “For our other sports, too—we hosted a big-time event, so recruits will know there are big-time events that come here.”
While Murphy doubts hosting GameDay will have measurable effects on recruiting results long-term, he notes that it has nonetheless been helpful. “We certainly used all of that in terms of our way to market our program. GameDay is a permanent presence in the 2014 highlight video, and it’s amazing how well and what a major college feel that gave to our Yale game, and certainly to our season last year.”
Williamson still relishes hosting the famous show.
“For that one day, the center of the college football universe was here,” he said.
The process of bringing GameDay to Allston started nearly four months in advance. The show, which has traveled across the country to college football games since 1993, had never made an appearance at a Harvard home football game, though the show did travel to a Harvard-Penn game in Philadelphia in 2002.
In August 2014, when Williamson and Miller began contacting ESPN, their primary goal was simply to convince the GameDay anchors to devote a short segment to the Harvard-Yale matchup during the week of The Game.
“We went through and picked out stories from our guys because we figured we’d get at least a feature story on GameDay,” Miller said. “We looked at Zack Hodges ’15 and his draft potential, Norman Hayes ’15 and his family tragedy.” Hayes' younger sister Olivia had died in an accident a few years earlier.
After a few weeks of e-mailing ESPN with pitches, however, Miller and Williamson began to realize hosting the show itself might be a possibility. According to Williamson, tides started to turn in Harvard’s favor as both teams continued to win games.
“[ESPN] didn’t respond to anything until after Yale beat Army,” Williamson said. “Then we clobbered Princeton—I think that had a sneaky little influence helping us since the game was on their network, ESPN3.”
After Harvard beat Dartmouth, it was all but inevitable that the race for the conference championship would go down to the wire. At that point, the Crimson led the Ivy League at 7-0 and the Bulldogs stood in second place at 6-1. Williamson then received a call from ESPN.
“I got a call that said, ‘If you guys keep winning, you have a good chance of hosting the show’,” Williamson said.
After Harvard beat Columbia and Yale defeated Brown in week eight of the regular season, GameDay told Williamson that they would be traveling to Harvard for an official site visit.
The visit, he knew, would not be an easy sell.
“They give you the standard booklet of things that GameDay needs, and it was a lot of space,” Miller said. “Something like several acres of space. They need a field to do their demonstrations on, and we realized we don’t have enough space in the quad, so we went back and forth about what to show them.”
The GameDay crew arrived on Veteran’s Day, and according to Williamson, a full staff turned in despite the holiday.
“We had 15 to 20 people across the department come in for the walk-through on their day off,” Williamson said. “Everyone was doing what they had to do to help facilities and I get the visit done.”
After Harvard defeated Penn the following week, GameDay called Williamson and made it official.
The week leading up to The Game was a blur. “The two of us didn’t sleep at all, and I was here every day at 5:30,” Williamson said. “The Game was almost an afterthought because ESPN was broadcasting Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday morning.
As producers pulled aside players and coaches throughout the week for interviews and specials on SportsCenter, which were filmed live on site for two days, the football program’s week was no less busy.
Murphy said, “Yale game week is always administratively and media relations-wise by far the most hectic week of the year for obvious reasons. This made it go from an extremely hectic week to an extraordinarily hectic week.”
“It seems like we were constantly juggling media requests that were either directly connected with GameDay or ESPN or a result of it," he added.
Murphy, however, praised the show’s intensity. “To their credit, GameDay was a constant presence, and I just couldn’t believe how personal and professional their talent people were, their on-site people, their administrative people.... It made me appreciate why GameDay is really such an iconic thing. Having to juggle all these events is well worth the opportunity to be on such a national platform.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ahead of this winter's United Nations conference on climate change in Paris, Harvard signed onto a pledge with 217 other institutions of higher learning to ask for an “ambitious agreement” at the summit and promise to “accelerate the transition to low-carbon energy while enhancing sustainable and resilient practices across our campus.”
Harvard’s role in combating climate change has been a topic marked by contention in recent years. University President Drew G. Faust has argued repeatedly—in Washington, D.C., Beijing, and Cambridge—that universities should aid in abating climate change through their research initiatives and innovations, rather than through taking political stances with their endowments. Last year, Faust awarded $800,000 in grants as part of the Climate Change Solutions Fund. 
Divest Harvard—a University-wide activist group calling on Harvard to divest its $37.6 billion endowment from fossil fuels—has consistently disagreed with Faust’s points, arguing instead that Harvard must take the lead in stigmatizing fossil fuel companies. Last year, the group held a series of demonstrations and occupations, including a week-long protest outside of Massachusetts Hall, which houses the offices of Faust and other top administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard looked inward and asked whether it is doing enough to make sure all students, regardless of their race or gender, benefit equally from a Harvard education. The answer came Thursday in the form of a wide-ranging and critical report touted by President Drew G. Faust. The conclusion: There’s more work to do.
“Harvard College is neither a finishing school nor a luxury good for America’s elites. Its primary work does not end with the admissions process but, rather, begins the moment its students enter its gates,” the report says. The 37-page report, written by the College’s diversity and inclusion working group, details three main areas in which Harvard should focus: bolstering training around student life diversity issues, augmenting the accessibility and diversity of departmental offerings, and promoting diversity among the faculty and College’s disciplinary bodies. The report calls for the creation of a University-wide task force to continually review ways to support diversity at Harvard. 
A few hours after Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana emailed the report to undergraduates Thursday morning, Harvard President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email to Harvard affiliates that she would indeed create a University-wide task force in accordance with the recommendations, which she called “thoughtful” and “one important foundation on which to build a more truly inclusive community.”
The working group that authored the report was convened by the College in the spring of 2014—about a month after the student art project “I, Too, Am Harvard” documented the experiences of black students at Harvard, earning national media attention. The task force is chaired by Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey minister in Memorial Church who last fall joined students in “die-in” protests as part of the Black Lives Matter movement.
The group—comprised of students, faculty, and administrators—met throughout the 2014-2015 academic year to study how peer institutions handle issues of diversity and consult University stakeholders before issuing a set of recommendations.
The report comes as students across the nation have erupted in protest against racism on their campuses. At Yale, students have held a string of marches in response to allegations of racism on their campus, and their president, Peter Salovey, responded this week by offering a set of policy changes, including doubling funding for cultural centers and diversifying faculty hires.
And Wednesday, dozens of Harvard students, faculty, and administrators joined a rally and marched to Porter Square to support student activism efforts across the country.
Harvard’s diversity report is expansive and at times critical in its analysis. It covers a range of topics, from the College’s residential advising system to biases in academic departments. It offers a set of both short- and long-term recommendations.
“In our work we were committed to not just identifying areas where everybody can feel included, but we wanted to track certain institutional practices that many take for granted but are often points of exclusion,” Walton said in an interview. “We were in conversation with Dean Khurana’s office the entire time because we know there were some issues that just could not wait.”
STUDENT LIFE
The report places particular emphasis on extracurricular activities and life in Harvard’s House life, offering several recommendations to bolster professional diversity training for House tutors and administrators and standardize diversity support systems across the Houses.
Using strong language, the report’s authors condemn an apparent lack of transparency in tutor hiring and discrepancies between individual Houses’ allocation of resources for diversity events. The report emphasizes the need to “convey the institution’s commitment to cultures of inclusion and appreciation of diversity…[which] is particularly true in the college/house systems that are randomized, lest the historical and cultural defaults of the institution prevail.”
Student and tutors, the report indicated, said some Houses have, on the whole, a more diverse staff of tutors or residential scholars than others. Some Houses also also offer more prestigious and better-funded House-specific scholarships for undergraduates than others. Additionally, the allocation of funds to diversity programming can vary widely across Houses, the committee wrote, leading many undergraduates to consider their particular Housemasters solely responsible for determining House priorities.
“Overall, students sense that house life depends on the particular housemasters and established house traditions, which invariably leads to inconsistency across the College,” the working group wrote, adding that many House masters disagreed with the claim.
According to the report, some tutors of color also “expressed surprise and dismay” when they were appointed race relations tutors without their prior consent.
As an example of perceived inequality between the Houses, the report specifically referenced a Crimson story published last spring detailing concerns from students in Dunster House who said the House did not offer adequate support to bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgender, or queer students.
“Any perceptions of inequality and lack of accountability comprise the credibility of the house system. The campus witnessed the result of failed transparency toward the end of the 2014-15 academic year, as students levied charges of discrimination against Dunster House,” the task force later wrote.
In addition to detailing needs for tutor hiring, the report’s authors wrote that many students and tutors emphasized the need to overhaul and improve diversity training and responsibilities for all House members. “Few” were optimistic about the House’s current use of race relations tutors, and “many,” according to the report, characterized tutor diversity training during orientation as “inadequate.”
People interviewed by the task force also requested more diversity training for staff, faculty members, and teaching fellows, a group that some said seemed “ill-equipped to facilitate conversations deemed controversial,” according to the report.
The task force also recommended that administrators “design cultural competency training” for all College staff who regularly interact with students.
In its recommendations on student life, the committee wrote that House administrators should create “a cohesive series of co-curricular activities that address the challenges and benefits associated with learning and living in a diverse residential community.”
In particular, the committee’s report calls for the creation of exhibits and competitions that showcase art about diversity and the removal of “unnecessary markers of social distinction to uphold the dignity of all students.”
The report also calls for reforms to Dorm Crew, the student-run cleanup service. The report suggests that the College should provide meals or students who work for Dorm Crew during pre-orientation and give workers the right to refuse to clean especially dirty rooms.
The report also calls for greater administrative support of student cultural groups and an examination of existing cultural spaces on campus.
Administrators have already implemented two student life-related suggestions that the committee made previously. The committee called for stricter enforcement of rules banning event lines specifically for students eligible for the Student Events Fund, which provides students with demonstrated financial aid free or discounted tickets for events, and administrators have since banned those lines. Last year, the College also kept two undergraduate dining halls open throughout spring break at the working group’s suggestion.
ACADEMICS AND ADMINISTRATION
The committee also called on Harvard to address the diversity of its academic offerings, faculty and administration, and adjudicatory bodies.
The working group wrote that some departmental practices can contribute to “homogeneous pipelines within select fields,” in contrast to what they characterized as the College’s desire for all students to have equal access to every concentration.
Of the thousands of courses currently offered by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, only about 217 courses “critically engage with issues of identity and difference,” according to the report. Most of the programs that address diversity fall within the Social Sciences division, the report’s authors wrote. The committee recommended expanding the number of courses that cover diversity and flagging those courses so students can search for them on the online course catalog.
To increase diversity among departments’ undergraduate concentrators, the committee recommended that departments outside of the Social Sciences division develop “pathways through the concentrations that would be attainable for all students, regardless of background.” It also recommended increasing the number of courses related to diversity within the College’s General Education program. That core curriculum, currently under review,  was deemed as “failing on a variety of fronts” last spring.
Beyond diversifying course offerings, the committee called on Harvard to hire more diverse faculty and staff members. In the report, committee members wrote that while each year Harvard’s newest freshman class is “more racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse,” its faculty, staff, and administrators “continue to lag behind in terms of diversity.”
The committee also recommended diversifying the College’s two disciplinary bodies and tasked the University’s Mental Health Services with developing a strategy to better reach “historically underserved populations.”
In the long term, the committee wrote, Harvard should also bring together offices that handle issues of diversity. That kind of administrative restructuring would “streamlin[e] its current structure into a much tighter and integrated set of offices with a greater level of collaboration.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In most years, undergraduates from Harvard and Yale gear up for the storied football game with merriment, shows of school spirit, and light-hearted jabs at their rival school. But as the two student bodies prepare for kick-off this Saturday, ongoing racial tensions in New Haven have brought a different tone to the typically spirited weekend.
Demonstrations by black student activists in response to allegations of racism have taken hold of Yale’s campus in recent weeks, and protests against racism have spread to other schools across the country, including Harvard. Dozens of Harvard students and affiliates participated in a rally and march on Wednesday in support of protesters on other campuses. 
Ahead of the weekend at Yale, some undergraduates say they hope to support the student protesters there, and they have adjusted their plans ahead of the weekend accordingly.
On Thursday, the College’s Office for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion hosted a student-led discussion on allyship ahead of The Game. The office and its team of diversity peer leaders facilitated a discussion focused on ways students can be allies to their peers and minority groups at The Game, as well as at Harvard. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana attended.
“I’m hoping there will be some sort of action and that it will be a genuine sign of solidarity,” discussion facilitator Esther Jeon ’17 said. “You have a lot of people who post on Facebook and wear the shirts, and talk the talk, but don’t take the time to understand what it means to be an ally.”
The diversity peer educators also created and distributed T-shirts and hats with the tagline “#solidaritY” for students to wear at The Game as a sign of support for the Yale protesters. In an email to College students this week, Assistant College Dean for Public Service Gene A. Corbin encouraged students to wear the shirts on Saturday in New Haven.
On Harvard Time, one of Harvard’s on-campus comedy groups, also broke from usual Harvard-Yale tradition in response to recent racial tensions at Yale. Ahead of this weekend’s game, the group declined to publish an annual comedic video that pokes fun at the rivalry between the two schools.
“After careful reflection, On Harvard Time has decided that this year we would rather promote camaraderie as opposed to conflict,” said Devon Guinn ’17, a leader of the troupe and a former Crimson editor. “As tensions run high at Yale, we recognize that now is not the time to release a video that would only further divide us.”
Students typically sell T-shirts touting Harvard as superior to Yale ahead of The Game, and this year some Harvard fans referenced the student movements at Yale in their designs. Some sold T-shirts describing Yale as “not an intellectual space,” which seems to reference a widely circulated video that shows a Yale student in a heated argument with Nicholas A. Christakis, a residential college master and former Harvard House master who has been at the center of the debate about race at Yale.
Nicholas’s wife, Erika L. Christakis ’86, had prompted controversy in late October when she sent an email to her college’s residents challenging an earlier message from Yale administrators advising students not to wear culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. Some students responded to that message with outrage, arguing that it was insensitive to minority students; the controversy has also prompted a debate over the freedom of speech on Yale’s campus.
According to the producers’ website, the “not an intellectual space” T-shirts have sold out.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
During a turbulent week of racial activism and controversy on campus, Latino students met with University President Drew G. Faust on Thursday morning to discuss demands to better include students of color on campus.
In a letter, the group demanded that Harvard designate one floor of the soon-to-be-renovated Smith Campus Center as a space for students of color on campus and allocate more funds to cultural and ethnic student groups. They also say Harvard should double the number of proctors and tutors who come from a diverse mix of cultural backgrounds and require administrators, faculty, and police to go through cultural sensitivity training. 
Some of the letter’s points were mentioned in a report that the College released Thursday afternoon evaluating and making recommendations on issues concerning inclusion and diversity, signatories said. The students behind the letter intend to focus partly on the report’s conclusions when they meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana next Monday.
Though previous discussions among Latino student groups were the basis for many of the demands, a controversy on Brown’s campus last weekend spurred the group to more immediate action this week, according to organizers.
Students gathered at a party for student delegates to the annual Latinx Ivy League Conference claimed that a Brown police officer assaulted Dartmouth student Geovanni Cuevas after a heated altercation. Following the incident, conference organizers postponed the event to focus instead on the issue of police brutality for the weekend. Harvard’s delegates then sent an initial letter to Faust’s office and Khurana asking to discuss the incident and issues facing Latino students on campus.
A separate letter, listing the demands that students brought to their meeting with Faust on Thursday, includes proposals more specific to Harvard, such as increasing funding for affinity groups, creating a multicultural center to provide services specific to cultural and ethnic groups, and changing the title of College House masters.
The students, who belong to the undergraduate cultural group Concilio Latino and Harvard’s Latinx Ivy League Conference delegation, decided to release the letter publicly to keep administrators accountable to the demands, delegate and Concilio member Kelly Navarro ’19 said. 
Students who attended the meeting with Faust on Thursday said it focused on the reasoning behind their demands and the Latino experience at Harvard more generally. While attendees said no concrete plans came out of the meeting, they said Faust was open to discussing a multicultural center for the University.
The letter also invited Faust to a planned Latino town hall meeting in February, an annual event where Latino students gather to discuss their experiences on campus.
“I welcome the opportunity to work with them to combat these injustices and to foster the culture of belonging to which Harvard is committed,” Faust later wrote in a statement.
Khurana also agreed to meet with Concilio Latino and some Latino delegates next Monday to discuss the incident at Brown, College-specific goals, and the recently released diversity report.
On Saturday, Brown President Christina H. Paxson took part in an open forum about the incident and administrators’ action to addressing structural racism on college campuses after the conference events were canceled. Paxson issued a formal apology to students and has promised to send a letter of apology to the presidents of all Ivy League universities, among other responses.
Concilio Latino’s demands come in the middle of a turbulent week for race relations at Harvard and campuses across the nation. Earlier on Thursday, police investigated a case of vandalism at Harvard Law School where portraits of black professors were covered with black tape. And on Wednesday, dozens of students marched in support of with black student activists at peer institutions such as Yale and the University of Missouri at Columbia, where racial controversies have raged this month.

Mariel A. Klein ’17 will lead the newly elected 143rd Guard of The Harvard Crimson, the organization’s President announced on Friday.
Klein will be The Crimson’s first female President since 2007, and three women will lead the newspaper for the first time since 2004.
Klein, a Government concentrator from Portland, Ore., and a Lowell House resident, currently serves as a news writer for The Crimson. As a reporter covering Harvard’s Central Administration, Klein has led the paper’s coverage of the University’s ongoing record-seeking capital campaign as well as the leadership of University President Drew G. Faust. Klein will assume the President’s post in January.
The paper’s outgoing editors elected their successors early Friday morning. The Crimson’s current President, Steven S. Lee ’16, shared the results with The Crimson's staff soon after.
“The 143rd Guard is a phenomenal group of leaders, who I am absolutely confident have the talent and drive to take great steps forward for The Crimson in the coming year,” Lee said Friday evening.
The Crimson’s Managing Editor-elect, Meg P. Bernhard ’17, is a news writer who covers the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. She will oversee the production of The Crimson’s daily newspaper, two magazines, and blogs.
Leia N. Wedlund ’17, an advertising manager for The Crimson, will take the helm of its finances and operations as Business Manager.
Founded in 1873, The Crimson is the only daily newspaper in Cambridge, Mass., and the oldest continuously published daily college newspaper.
The Crimson chooses its leaders through an election process known as the Turkey Shoot, in which all outgoing executives are invited to participate. A successful candidate must receive at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected to a given position.
Joining Klein, Bernhard, and Wedlund on the masthead are:
Associate Managing Editors: Noah J. Delwiche ’17 and Ivan B. K. Levingston ’17
Associate Business Managers: M. Hanl Park ’18 and Michael B. Sacks ’17
Editorial Chairs: Nelson L. Barrette ’17 and Ryan P. O’Meara ’18
Arts Chairs: Ha D. H. Le ’17 and Victoria Lin ’17
Blog Chairs: Katherine J. Cohen ’18 and Eva S. Monroe ’18
Design Chairs: Nadia X. Haile ’17 and Ashley Zhou ’17
FM Chairs: Lena K. Felton ’17 and Maia R. Silber ’17
Multimedia Chairs: Thomas W. Frank ’17 and Sidni M. Frederick ’17
Sports Chairs: Julio C. Fierro ’17 and Ariel Smolik-Valles ’17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­Last Saturday, Harvard football fans experienced an unfamiliar sight. As the clock expired and postgame handshakes concluded, Penn players lingered on the field for much longer than visitors to Harvard Stadium typically do.
They were celebrating.
It had been over two years since the Crimson last found itself on the short side of the scoreboard. The 35-25 defeat at the hands of the Quakers on Senior Day snapped a 22-game Harvard winning streak.
But the Crimson can ill afford to dwell excessively on the past. For this Saturday represents the annual rendition of the biggest spectacle on the team’s schedule: The Game.
“You can approach the situation in two ways,” senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer said. “You’ll have a team that gets the big loss after a big win streak and kind of gets deflated. Or you can have the team that gets angry. I think that’s the sense that this team took and these players took.”
Harvard (8-1, 5-1 Ivy) will need to regroup quickly, because the stakes are high. A win over Yale (6-3, 3-3) in New Haven will clinch for the Crimson a share of its third straight Ivy League title. If Dartmouth and Penn take care of business in their respective games, the championship will be split three ways.
To be sure, the hype is not what it was last year. There’s no College GameDay in town, no undefeated record at stake, and no championship duel with the Bulldogs at hand.
But The Game is The Game, and Saturday marks its 132nd edition. For players on both sidelines, it does not get any better than ending the season with a victory over their archrival.
“[Yale] is going to be really hungry, really motivated, and we’re going to have to be equally or more hungry and more motivated,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “So much of this game is a game of emotion, and I know our kids will be ready to play.”
Harvard has topped Yale eight times in a row, though that streak nearly came to an end last year as the squads found themselves tied late in the fourth quarter. This year, the Bulldogs will need to play their best football to beat a senior-heavy Crimson squad.
The graduation of three All-Ivy first teamers—running back Tyler Varga, along with wide receivers Deon Randall and Grant Wallace—means the prolific Yale offense of last year is gone. In week four, the Blue and White lost to Dartmouth by 32 points, and the team later gave Columbia its first Ivy victory since 2012.
Luckily for coach Tony Reno, though, his Yale squad may be getting hot at the right time. After moving junior defensive back Dale Harris to the running back position on account of the team’s injuries and offensive struggles, the Bulldogs have registered two wins in as many weeks. A spark in the ground game, highlighted by 177 rushing yards from Harris last week against Princeton, helped Yale post its two highest point totals of the season—41 and 35.
“They’re a really good team that is all of a sudden playing with a lot of confidence, a lot of enthusiasm,” Murphy said. “They seem to have found themselves.”
A more balanced offense removes some pressure from the shoulders of senior quarterback Morgan Roberts, who has struggled at times this season. A 2014 All-Ivy second teamer, Roberts has tossed just three touchdowns to go along with nine interceptions in his last seven games.
While Yale ranks close to the Ivy League average in most defensive categories, it brings to the table a pair of talented defensive backs in captain Cole Champion and sophomore Hayden Carlson. The latter is tied for first in the Ancient Eight with 81 tackles, and their combination presents a test for Crimson senior quarterback Scott Hosch and his receivers.
“We take that as a challenge,” Fischer said. “We like to play against DBs. We like to go out there and play against the best and show what we can do.”
After outscoring opponents by an average of 36 points over the season’s first six games, the Crimson has recently experienced much tighter contests against stronger foes. Harvard followed up a one-point victory over Dartmouth with a tighter-than-expected win at Columbia, before falling for the first time in 22 games to Penn.
Much of the credit for the Crimson’s success this season goes necessarily to Hosch, who has provided a steady hand at the quarterback position while offensive linemen, running backs, and wide receivers have gone down to injury.
Senior tight end Ben Braunecker leads the receiving corps with 85 yards per game and six touchdowns, while freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley has emerged as a rising star and a capable punt returner. The duo represents a key reason why Hosch is 149 yards shy of breaking the school’s single-season passing record.
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson defense has struggled of late compared to its early-season dominance. But led by captain Matt Koran at linebacker, the unit still ranks as the third-best scoring defense in the FCS and could pose problems for Roberts and the Bulldogs.
“We definitely played a lot tougher teams the past couple times,” senior defensive back Jordan Becerra said. “We haven’t been playing to our full potential, and I know we can. Hopefully we put it all together this week.”
Earlier this week, Koran held a players-only meeting to get his squad refocused on the task at hand—beating Yale. Saturday presents an opportunity for the team’s senior class to leave its mark on the field one final time.
Unlike last season, this year’s Yale squad finds itself on the outside looking in at the title race. But there is nothing the Bulldogs would like more than to deprive Harvard of a co-championship. The Crimson, meanwhile, needs just 60 minutes to bounce back from a loss and reach its ultimate goal for the third straight season.
“We’re still in the run for the Ivy League championship,” senior offensive lineman Cole Toner said. “We don’t take that for granted. We get a mulligan, per se.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s chances at an Ivy League title were slowly slipping away.
Week six. Harvard Stadium. In a heavyweight battle between two undefeated teams, Dartmouth led by six points and had possession at midfield with under four minutes remaining. Even if the Crimson defense forced a punt, the prospects of a successful drive with no timeouts remaining seemed remote.
Harvard desperately needed a big play. Senior linebacker Jacob Lindsey provided it.
As Big Green running back Ryder Stone received a pitch, Lindsey swept around the edge of the line and laid the ball carrier on his back, jarring the pigskin loose in the process. Captain and fellow linebacker Matt Koran was the first to dive on it.
Harvard had life once again, and the home team went on to win the game with a last-minute touchdown. The season, for the moment, had been saved.
If one had to bet who would be most likely to provide that defensive spark, the wiser among us would have pointed to the linebackers. Lindsey forced the fumble. Koran was in the right place. Senior linebacker Eric Medes, away from the ball on the decisive play, registered a game-high 10 tackles.
It was fitting that the trio stepped up in the season’s most pivotal contest. The starting linebacker unit—Lindsey, Koran, and Medes—has performed at an elite level through nine games this year and is a critical reason why Harvard is in position to clinch its third consecutive Ivy League title on Saturday against Yale.
“If you look at leadership and production, it’s as good a group as we’ve ever had as a senior trio,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said.
Let’s start with production. With a single contest remaining, Lindsey, Koran, and Medes lead the team with 61, 55, and 51 tackles, respectively. The next highest defender comes in at 34. There has not been that big of a drop from the top three players in over a decade.
But who’s counting? The linebackers certainly may be.
“There’s even a competitive atmosphere between the three of us,” Lindsey said. “To go out there and be productive and make the plays you can make and go a step beyond, that I think feeds upon itself.”
Lindsey, Koran, and Medes all fall within the top 15 tacklers in the Ancient Eight. The trio certainly has much to do with the fact that the Harvard defense currently ranks third in the FCS with 12.3 points allowed per game.
“We have the utmost trust in each other,” Koran said. “We know that the other [two] guys are going to get the job done…. We kind of feed off each other. When one guy makes a big play, the other guy gets really excited.”
The production speaks for itself. But the impact of the linebackers extends far beyond mere statistics.
Ultimately, it starts with leadership. Rarely are all three starting linebackers seniors and experienced ones at that. Lindsey, Koran, and Medes each played important roles on last year’s top-ranked FCS defense, and they saw varying degrees of action their sophomore seasons.
Their individual production in 2015 is a testament to the amount the unit has gelled over the years through countless reps in practices and games. It also speaks to their durability. Despite the extreme physical demands of the linebacker position, all three starters have remained healthy this season, ready to call the shots for the other eight Crimson defenders.
“They know exactly what’s going on, and they have a really good grasp of the defense,” senior defensive back Jordan Becerra said. “So when those guys are out there, they’re pretty much commanding us. We know exactly what’s going to happen.”
Koran’s leadership, of course, is not limited to the defense. This year marks the 11th consecutive year that Harvard football’s sole captain has been a defensive player. In four of the last five seasons, the “C” has been worn by a linebacker.
The latest in that line of gritty leaders is Koran, for whom the position of linebacker forces him to adopt an identity of toughness and maximum effort on every play.
“It’s not the most glorious position,” Koran said. “You’re not out there scoring touchdowns or anything along those lines. You’re kind of doing it just for the team.”
Leadership and production also go hand in hand for Koran’s two position-mates. According to Murphy, Lindsey could be the most athletic linebacker in the Ivy League, and he led Harvard in tackles his junior season. Medes, for his part, is a three-year starter who has not missed a single game over that span.
Harvard has had some standout linebackers in recent years. For instance, captain Alex Gedeon ’12, who posted 92 tackles in his senior season, provided a degree of athleticism difficult to match.
But it is the combination of three veteran talents in Lindsey, Koran, and Medes that make the 2015 linebacker corps special. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts due to steadily acquired experience and leadership. The trio ultimately represents the heart of a Harvard defense that has reached new heights under its watch.
“They’ve played a lot of games together,” Murphy said. “So the chemistry and the maturity, the poise, and the production of that group is really sort of unique for all of those reasons. It’ll be really, really challenging to replace those guys next year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­In the history of the Ivy League, Harvard football has never been as dominant over a five-year stretch as it has been between 2011 and 2015.
Statistically speaking, there is not even a debate. Just examine the records: 9-1 in 2011, 8-2 in 2012, 9-1 in 2013, 10-0 in 2014, and 8-1 in 2015 with one game remaining.
During this period, the team has won three Ancient Eight championships and gone two seasons—2011 and 2014—without dropping a conference game. The team has outscored opponents by over 600 points over that span in total, and the defense has held opponents’ attacks to single-digit totals 34 percent of the time. Within this half-decade of pure dominance, no stretch has been more impressive than the 22-game win streak that Harvard put together starting in 2013 with a 24-21 triumph over Dartmouth and ending last weekend in a 35-25 defeat against Penn.
“When you’ve won 22 straight games, wow, you have a target on your front and a target on your back,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “We’re used to it, but I’m not sure there’s been any team for a long, long time that gets that shot.”
That 22-game run encompassed a perfect 2014 season, only the second 10-0 campaign in school history, which included a last-second, title-deciding, nationally televised 31-24 nailbiter over Yale.
Yes, the Crimson has been pretty good over the past few years.
The team has been so good, in fact, that one of the only people to face consistent late-game pressure, week in and week out, is the team statistician, who must come up with novel ways to describe excellence every Saturday.
For example, did you know this year’s defense held opponents without a touchdown for a period of 212:30, a vast desert of time that spanned from a Sept. 26 matchup against Brown to an Oct. 24 game versus Princeton?
Did you also know that Harvard’s current seniors have the second-highest winning percentage of any modern-era Crimson class? That Harvard has an active streak—and program record—of 14 straight road wins? That the 1931-1932 Penn team was the last side to hold opponents to a total of 39 points or fewer over six games, a feat that the Crimson accomplished earlier this season?
Complex or not, all these numbers add up to an impressively clean one. If Harvard wins on Saturday, it will clinch at least a share of its third straight Ancient Eight title, something no Crimson team has ever achieved.
Never has the Harvard approach to football been so validated.
However sobering these statements can be, they fail to tell the whole story. Figures and facts do not win games; players do, and over the course of five years, if not longer, the Crimson program has refined a routine for teaching excellence.
As a fifth-year senior, wide receiver Seitu Smith has witnessed the success of the team since its 9-1 season in 2011. For Smith, the aspect of success that sticks out the most is the time-heavy dedication of players.
From the winter through the start of the next season, Harvard athletes normally wake up at 5:30 a.m. to get in an early workout. During last summer, about 50 of them stayed on campus for additional work, and during the season, players fill their schedules with film sessions and group meetings in addition to daily practice.
The players work together, eat together, and live together, and the cohesion means when they play together, the performance is that much more seamless.
According to Smith, this level of dedication is not par for the Ivy League. For example, schools such as Princeton do not require morning workouts. Likewise, Yale does not run as robust a summer program.
“We work year in and year out, day in and day out,” Smith said. “Every day is a competition.”
One particular area in which this hard work pays off is special teams. In 2015 alone, the list of categories in which Harvard ranks nationally reads like a special-teams coach’s dream. The Crimson is second in the FCS with five blocked punts, third with seven blocked kicks, fourth with an average punt-return defense of 1.2 yards, and fifth with an average punt return of 18.7 yards.
An ability to manipulate field position opens up space for the Harvard attack, which has demonstrated its potential as a passing threat over the past few years. Heading into Saturday’s action, senior quarterback Scott Hosch needs 149 yards to break the school record for passing yards in a season.
Prior to last weekend, Hosch had gone 14 career starts without losing a game, also a Harvard record. Such is the benefit of playing behind an offensive line with three returning starters—and in an era of expected dominance.
To complement the passing attack over the past five years, the Crimson has relied on a ground game that has used exactly two starting running backs: Treavor Scales ’12 in 2011 and 2012 and Paul Stanton since. Both are sub-5’10” rushers who nonetheless have relied on a bruising running style, and both have provided a reliable veteran presence from year to year, steadying the team’s attack.
In recent seasons, however, Harvard’s true source of strength has been on the other side of the ball.
In 2014, the Crimson led all of FCS football in scoring defense. While the 35-25 defeat to the Quakers dampened that statistic for this season, Harvard has maintained a base of tough-nosed defenders.
Consider this fact—10 of 11 defensive starters returned from last year’s undefeated team. Intact was a senior linebacker trio of Jacob Lindsey, Matt Koran, and Eric Medes that finished one-two-three in tackles for Harvard in 2014 and will do so again this season.
“[In practice] we had the best defense this year in the Ivy League against one of the best offenses,” Smith said. “When we play anyone else, it’s like, ‘Oh, it’s a step down.’”
One way that the program has institutionalized the strength of the defense is through the tradition of selecting a defensive player as captain. Not since 2004 have team members selected an offensive star as their leader—and in that case, it was NFL-bound quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
So much success over such a long timeframe inevitably raises yearly expectations. A year without a championship could be counted as a failure, but Murphy disagrees.
“I don’t look at it that way,” he said. “If the kids give us everything they can, and they live up to their potential, then I can live with that…. That’s how I judge them.”
But for a 2015 squad that started the year with eight straight wins, playing up to preseason expectations very likely means leaving New Haven with a victory.
It is not just a matter of beating an archrival to close the season—Harvard has already done that eight times in a row, another school record.
Rather, it’s a matter of continuing a narrative of excellence that began in 2011 and shows signs of continuing well past 2015.
“These kids, they’ve given us everything they could give,” Murphy said. “They’ve played hard. They’ve been so committed. They’ve been so selfless.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
­In the military, a Navy SEAL embodies the definition of versatility and physicality. After going through a rigorous selection course that tests the limits of fitness, a SEAL trains for months on end. Then once training is complete, a SEAL has the potential to be thrust into any environment, any situation, and can be expected to carry out any military special operation.
On a Division I college football roster, there is no dearth of strength and certainly no lack of athletic talent across all positions. Each player puts in hours of strenuous training over years of practice.
But on the Harvard football team, one position seems to undergo more demanding preparation, require a bit more adaptability, and perhaps possess a trace more grit, as evidenced by the Crimson alumni at this position in the National Football League.
It is unsurprising, therefore, that Harvard coach Tim Murphy draws the comparison between the elite warriors of the U.S. military and this group of players—the tight ends.
“We’re the SEALs of the football forces,” Murphy said. “We’ve got to be guys that are as athletic as wide receivers. We’ve got to be able to be in-line guys and block defensive ends, fullbacks and drop linebackers. We’ve got to be slot receivers who can beat man coverage.”
Even in the Crimson’s run-first offense, it’s easy to see that Murphy, who is the position coach for the tight ends as well as the head coach, heavily features his pupils.
In each of the last six seasons, four different tight ends have either been the leading or second-leading receiver for Harvard, an impressive feat given the speed and talent level of the Crimson’s wide receivers in recent years.
The expanded tight end operation is a relatively recent development at Harvard, however. It began in 2010, when Murphy recruited a 6’3” high school receiver in Kyle Juszczyk ’13 and converted him to play both tight end and H-back.
“[Juszczyk] was kind of the first guy that Coach Murphy utilized all over the field, kind of like what our offense has progressed into now, where you don’t know where the tight end is going to line up—in the backfield, on the line, or split out wide as a receiver,” said Cameron Brate ’14, now a tight end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “‘Juice’ was a pioneer in that aspect.”
When the 6’5” Brate, another brawny high school receiver-turned college tight end, came along a year later, the two-tight end set pervasive in Harvard’s offensive scheme today was increasingly utilized. Murphy’s experiment paid off as Juszczyk was named First Team All-America by the Associated Press in 2012 and Brate became a two-time First Team All-Ivy selection.
Three years after Juszczyk hung up his Harvard uniform, the tight end model has yet to retire. The 2015 version of the Juszczyk-Brate tandem is the duo of senior Ben Braunecker and junior Anthony Firkser, both over 6’2” and former high school receivers.
Despite never having played tight end before coming to Cambridge, Braunecker and Firkser have taken to their collegiate roles seamlessly—Firkser was named to the All-Ivy League second team as a sophomore, and Braunecker currently leads the team in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.
For the two rising stars, the only real fight for playing time has been with each other. While sharing the same position and head coach can be an advantage during play selection, it comes at the price of enduring Murphy’s critical judgment a little more closely than perhaps any other player on the field.
“To be honest, I think ‘Firk’ and I still have emotional scars from the criticism that we took as freshmen, maybe even as sophomores,” Braunecker said. “It’s a rigorous gauntlet, almost, that if you can pass all of his tests and get out on the playing field, you know you’ve made it.”
Passing the tests involves developing the skills necessary to play tight end in the Harvard system, including pass protection and run blocking—skills often lacking in high school receivers.
Because of that, the shift from receiver to tight end brings with it a whole new set of terminology and techniques, a steep learning curve for players also adjusting to the expectations of college football. Luckily for Braunecker and Firkser, however, the veterans already at the position meant built-in mentorship.
“When I came in as a freshman, [Juszczyk] really took me under his wing, and he was a great guy to look up to, so I tried to do the same thing with Ben and Firk,” Brate said. “When Murphy’s your coach, he’ll get on you, so having the other guys in your room have your back a bit picks your spirits back up when he brings you down.”
Toughness to survive in an unfamiliar position is something Murphy looks for while recruiting potential tight ends, as well as the versatility necessary to fill the role. Braunecker and Firkser’s flourishing is just further evidence of the coach’s aptitude for bringing in raw talent and honing receivers into polished tight ends that can hold their own on the fast-paced Harvard offense—or even in the pros.
Juszczyk became the first Harvard player drafted since quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 when the Baltimore Ravens selected him in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft. Juszczyk is listed as a fullback on the Ravens’ roster but seems to have continued a flexible H-back-type role in the NFL, with 196 receiving yards and two touchdowns under his belt thus far in 2015. Brate went undrafted but signed with the Buccaneers in 2014. This year, Brate has appeared in seven games and caught a touchdown.
Harvard is currently the only Ivy League team with three skill players—including Fitzpatrick—on active NFL rosters, and that number may increase if Braunecker follows in the footsteps of his predecessors.
“[Going pro] is something that I’ve dreamt of as a kid,” Braunecker said. “It’s only become a reality as of last year. Murph told me that this is a possibility...so I was like, ‘Absolutely, I’m going to commit everything to do it and give it my best shot.’ You only have one opportunity to do this, so I’m all in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A long win streak spanning multiple seasons. A chance for a third championship for the first time in school history.
I am, of course, talking about the Harvard football team, entering last week’s penultimate contest against Penn with hopes of clinching the Ivy title, right?
Wrong. Once upon a time, I followed non-Ivy League college football, and I was a diehard USC Trojans fan (growing up in the Pete Carroll/Matt Leinart/Reggie Bush era, how could I not be?). The mid-2000s were fraught with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows for me, partially because middle school happened, but mostly because of the rise and fall of USC.
So when ESPN released its 30 for 30 film in September on USC football in the Carroll era, I put off watching it, not wishing to relive my painful childhood memories. Last Friday, I decided it was time to come to terms with my decade-long hatred of Vince Young (tough thing to have living in Texas).
It all came back to me—the jubilation during the 34-game streak without a loss, the shock and denial after a third-straight BCS national championship was stolen by the burnt orange jerseys in USC’s backyard at the 2006 Rose Bowl, and the crashing of a dynasty post-NCAA sanctions.
Perhaps it was because this heartbreak was so fresh in my mind that what happened the next day wasn’t so shocking. You know the story—Penn comes onto Harvard’s home turf, snaps a 22-game win streak, steals the Crimson’s chance at clinching a title share for the third consecutive season. Déjà vu?
Not entirely, so fear not, Harvard fans. It doesn’t have to go the way of the 2006 USC Trojans.
Your season isn’t over and championship hopes are still alive. As if to prove that league parity is as high as each Ancient Eight coach claimed in the preseason, three teams—Harvard, Dartmouth, and Penn—are tied atop the league with just one week remaining in the season.
All three have played each other this season, so barring more upsets, we will have co-co-champions for the 2015 Ivy League title come Saturday. Unlike the Trojans, the Crimson has a final chance for redemption, and what sweeter way to end the season than a drubbing of that school in New Haven?
And even if the unthinkable happens, and Harvard loses The Game for the first time in eight years, take solace, Crimson fans, in the fact that your team (probably) won’t be embroiled in a devastating scandal a few months from now that will cause your head coach to leave, previous titles to be removed, and the disintegration of your dominance as a football superpower. Not that I’m still bitter or anything.
BROWN AT COLUMBIA
If Saturday’s Ivy League slate is the main concert, then Friday night’s game is the opening act that no one really cares about—it’s almost as if the Ivy League schedulers had the foresight of knowing that this game would be meaningless to the title race. If you’re looking for something to watch Friday night, I’ve heard good things about Fox’s MasterChef Junior, and who doesn’t love watching Gordon Ramsay berate nine-year-olds?
But if you’re dead-set on a football Friday, it might be entertaining to see if Brown loses, potentially creating a three-way tie at the bottom of the Ancient Eight standings.
Prediction: Brown 24, Columbia 6
PRINCETON AT DARTMOUTH
According to The Daily Princetonian, a tiger statue on the Princeton campus was defaced last week with expletives. I highly doubt the Dartmouth football players made the 316 mile trek to New Jersey (and if you are going to flee Hanover, would you really go to Jersey?), but they’ll get their own chance to embarrass the Tigers this weekend in what likely will be a rout.
Look for Big Green quarterback Dalyn Williams to have a statement performance as he has a final game-time opportunity to impress the NFL scouts who drew the short straw on scouting games.
Prediction: Dartmouth 42, Princeton 24
CORNELL AT PENN
For the second year in a row, the saving grace for the Big Red is the week nine contest against Columbia, which will probably—once more—be Cornell’s only victory of 2015. The Big Red has about as much of a chance of winning in Philly as my beloved Dallas Cowboys have of making the playoffs—the odds are, in a word, horrendous.
Then again, miracles do happen, and perhaps a win knocking Penn out of the title hunt will be enough to save Cornell coach David Archer’s job after a 2-17 tenure.
Prediction: Penn 38, Cornell 3
HARVARD AT YALE
If it wasn’t for The Game, I would bet a lot of money that the majority of Harvard students would not set foot in a football stadium all year. Indeed, the amount of grumbling I’ve heard that tickets “actually cost money” makes me wonder how much attendance is driven by peer pressure, an excuse to consume alcohol an hour after waking up, versus by an actual desire to watch football.
Students that remain sober enough to turn their attention to the gridiron Saturday may be in for a real treat, however. Although Yale has no Vince Young, this contest will likely be the closest of the three that will decide how many shares of the Ivy League title will be parsed out. Still, I think the Crimson football team is already too angry at having to share the title to let the Bulldogs steal this one.
Prediction: Harvard 34, Yale 17

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although many Crimson supporters will be wholly focused upon “The Game” between the Harvard and Yale football teams this coming weekend, there are a few other Crimson squads that have competitions this weekend with major NCAA implications.
Women’s Volleyball vs. Princeton (Friday 7:00p.m.)
Harvard Women’s Volleyball clinched a share of the Ancient Eight title for the second straight season with its 3-1 victory against Brown this past Saturday. Sitting atop the league with Princeton, the Crimson (14-10, 10-4 Ivy) relishes the chance to compete against the Tigers (15-8, 10-4) in a deciding play-in game to earn the Ivy League’s automatic berth to the NCAA tournament.
Looking for a different result than the loss at the hands of rival Yale in the play-in game a year ago, the Crimson is playing to reach the NCAA tournament for the first time in the history of the program.
During the teams’ regular season matchups, each squad won, 3-0, on its home court, but it is yet to be seen whether that trend will continue.
To put an end to Princeton’s seven-match win streak, Harvard defense must neutralize the Tigers’ Cara Mattaliano and Kendall Peterkin. Each Princeton player posted at least 15 kills and 10 digs in the most recent game between the two schools in New Jersey.
Men’s Water Polo CWPA Championships (Begins Friday 6:00 p.m.)
After a heartbreaking double-overtime loss, 14-13, to Brown in the finals of last weekend’s CWPA Northern Division Championship, the No. 12 Harvard men’s water polo team will compete in the CWPA Championships this weekend for a potential berth in the NCAA tournament.
In its first match of the tournament at MIT’s Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center, the Crimson (19-9, 9-3 CWPA Northern) will face winner of the Navy vs. Washington & Jefferson College game earlier in the day.
Harvard will look to best it’s seventh place finish from a year ago by riding the recently clutch play of senior attacker Blake Lee, who forced both overtimes against Brown with last second scores.
Cross Country NCAA and IC4A Championships (Saturday)
Continuing to post strong results in her sophomore campaign for the Crimson, Courtney Smith was the lone Harvard runner to qualify for the NCAA Championships on Saturday in Louisville, Kentucky with her 5th place finish in the 6K at NCAA Regionals. Smith is the first Harvard woman to accomplish such a feat since the entire team qualified in 2012.
The Crimson men’s cross country team heads off to in the IC4A Championships on Saturday at Van Cortlandt Park in New York, N.Y.
Coming off of an 8th place finish at NCAA Regionals headlined by senior Chris Allen’s 28th place finish with a time of 31:27 in the 10K, the Harvard squad looks to add to its list of top-ten finishes on the season.
