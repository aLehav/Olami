After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 2005, the California State Legislature passed a bill to restrict the sale and rental to minors of ultra-violent video games—those containing “killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually assaulting an image of a human being” in such an extreme fashion as to appeal to “a deviant or morbid interest”—imposing $1000 fines for each violation. The legislature made its decision in part based upon contentious social-scientific findings linking these video games to later violent acts. The law was immediately challenged by the entertainment industry, and has made its way to the Supreme Court, where oral arguments were heard last week. The case has generated controversy: Entities from Microsoft to the makers of “World of Warcraft” have expressed opposition to the law, while the state of California, including Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, has vigorously defended it.
We believe that on the matter of ultra-violent video games, a state legislature is entitled to hear expert testimony and ultimately render policy on the basis of analysis of that evidence. Some states may find insufficient basis for regulation, while others will surely decide to impose such restrictions, as California has. We support their right to make this important decision, as democratically empowered by their constituents. The people of any state must be allowed to protect their children from exposure to potentially injurious material.
To condemn this as censorship, as the entertainment industry has done, is to misconstrue the situation. Under the California law, the state would neither be regulating the content of video games, nor who could play them. Rather, the government would merely be creating cautionary barriers to acquisition of these games, in light of their perverse and potentially harmful content. Parents could still buy these games for their children, and there would be no restrictions on what sort of games producers may create. Similar barriers—long upheld by the courts—already exist with reference to movies and pornography. Why should video games, simply by dint of being a relatively newer media, be exempt from such scrutiny? Indeed, it is past time that the courts ruled on this new medium, and its relationship to protected speech must be defined.
That said, we find this specific California statute impractical and wasteful in that it obligates government to assess the content of every game on the market. Rather, we suggest that state regulators make use of market incentives to affect the same change, imposing steep fines for retailers who provide Mature rate or Adults Only rated games to minors. Some lawmakers have expressed lack of confidence in the industry’s own Entertainment Software Rating Board system and willingness to curtail profitable trafficking in obscene material to minors; thus, fines and increased  enforcement are both warranted.
As Chief Justice John Roberts put it, “We do not have a tradition in this country of telling children they should watch people actively hitting schoolgirls over the head with a shovel…being merciless and decapitating them, shooting people in the leg so they fall down…We protect children from that.” We support the right of the American people to shield its most vulnerable and hope the Supreme Court affirms that right in its ruling in June.

Although there is no question that some of the computer or video games currently available for sale in the United States depict horrific acts of violence, California’s proposed ban on the sale of “deviant or morbid” games to minors threatens to set a dangerous precedent. The five-year-old statute—which has been ruled unconstitutional by multiple courts and is now being debated by the United States Supreme Court—is not only bad policy, but also threatens the First Amendment rights of video-game publishers and consumers alike.
First and foremost, the California law constitutes bad policy. It imposes an impossibly heavy burden on the state government to police every aspect of the video-game industry and also ignores the numerous industry safeguards that are already in place to prevent minors from purchasing these games in the first place. Virtually every game published in or imported into the United States must pass under the scrutiny of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, a private group supported by all of the major video game publishers. The ESRB rates video games on a similar scale to the Motion Picture Association of America’s famous letter-coding system for movies.
Of the thousands of games released every year, only a small percentage earn a “Mature” or Adults Only rating. Mature video games are considered restricted products, similar to R-rated films; virtually every major retailer will ask for photo identification before selling them. Similarly, Adults Only video games are considered the equivalent of hardcore pornography, available only to adults over the age of 18 in specialty outlets. The video-game industry has worked for years with retailers to enforce these policies; just last year, the Federal Trade Commission published a report that acknowledged that these efforts have been extremely successful, calling the ESRB the “gold standard” for industry self-regulation.
Moreover, California’s law imposes an unnecessary burden on the state government at a time when Sacramento is already cutting essential services like public education. Should the law be upheld, every video game released in California will require a costly classification procedure, one that ignores the considerable expertise of the ESRB. Moreover, the standards used to judge a video game as “deviant” or “morbid” have not been made public. Without an objective standard, the California law will create a chilling effect on a rapidly growing sector of the entertainment industry. Given the current economic climate, this is hardly what California—home to Silicon Valley and dozens of tech companies—can afford.
Finally, the California law is just the latest in a very long tradition of governments experiencing a moral panic over harmless popular entertainment, including dime novels, comic books, films, and popular music. For decades, the Supreme Court has ruled, with very minor exceptions, that these laws are unconstitutional, infringing on the First Amendment rights of both the publisher and the consumer. And the California case is hardly the first to address this issue; nine other states have attempted to block the sale of violent video games, and all nine of their efforts have been ruled unconstitutional.
As such, no matter how objectionable some video games may seem, they are protected speech under the Bill of Rights. Given that the video game industry has taken extensive steps to prevent minors from acquiring these games, the California law is nothing more than a ludicrous example of government overstepping its bounds. The only solution that can effectively stop minors from acquiring these video games is one that is as old as entertainment itself: good parenting.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of Oct. 13, new pledges to the Yale fraternity Delta Kappa Epsilon marched through the residential section of Yale’s campus. The students, some blindfolded, chanted such revolting phrases as “No means yes! Yes means anal!” and “My name is Jack, I’m a necrophiliac; I fuck dead women, and fill them with my semen!”
Any remotely intelligent human being must recognize the inappropriate nature of those words, and I am certain that the impressionable DKE pledges would be mortified by their actions if they seriously reflected on them. However, the fact remains that bright men chanted misogynistic phrases that, intentionally or not, encouraged rape. The Yale Women’s Center justifiably condemned the event as “hate speech” and “an active call for sexual violence.”
Since then, members of DKE have formally apologized to the Women’s Center for their actions. Two other Yale fraternities have condemned DKE. The Yale administration issued a formal statement promising to reprimand the leaders of DKE. Nonetheless, an instance of blatant sexual harassment affecting a large number of Yale freshman occurred in 2010 in one of the most open-minded universities in the country.
No matter how much we like to deny it, Harvard and Yale are very similar. Our students come from the same backgrounds, study the same subjects, and live and breathe in the same Ivy-League environment. As Harvard students, we should not shrug off last week’s horrifying events as additional proof for why “Yale sucks.” Instead, the DKE incident must serve as a warning to Harvard.
It is easy to view the “no means yes” chants as an isolated instance conceived of by impulsive, misguided, and possibly intoxicated frat brothers. However, the Yale community’s reaction to the DKE incident belies this convenient dismissal. In fact, on Oct. 18, the Yale Daily News published an editorial calling the Yale Women’s Center’s response an “overreaction.” It proclaimed that “feminists at Yale should remember that, on a campus as progressive as ours, most of their battles are already won: All of us agree on gender equality.”
These statements are not only discomforting, but also ridiculous. It is patently obvious that not all on Yale’s campus “agree on gender equality”; if this were so, DKE would not be in nearly so much trouble now.
The Yale Daily News is a widely read and respected paper whose editorials supposedly indicate the consensus view of the newspaper editorial board itself. The YDN has apologized for the disturbing nature of its article, but this editorial certainly does not reflect the inebriated impulse of a few frat brothers. The fact that intelligent and thoughtful Yale students consciously decided to condemn the Women’s Center for its reaction to the DKE incident exposes just how pervasive anti-feminist views can be on a college campus.
Worst of all, this is not the first such chauvinistic event to take place at Yale. Last year, Yale men circulated a “pre-season scouting report” discussing the hottest freshmen girls. Previously, members of another Yale fraternity took photographs of their pledges outside the Women’s Center holding signs that read, “We Love Yale Sluts.”
Luckily, Harvard has experienced no such public demonstrations of misogyny in its recent history. But as a freshman woman at Harvard, the recent events at Yale make me profoundly uncomfortable.
Harvard, too, has a Women’s Center, although it has not issued any public comment on the DKE incident. Similarly, the Radcliffe Union of Students has disseminated information about the DKE incident over its mailing list, but has neglected to make a public statement about the affair.
Although I am disappointed that neither organization has done anything to reassure or warn Harvard students about the dangers of sexually discriminatory and offensive rhetoric, the simple presence of these groups on Harvard’s campus comforts me. And in my opinion, the DKE incident emphasizes why such establishments as the Harvard College Women’s Center and the Radcliffe Union of Students are absolutely necessary. Hopefully, they will continue to fulfill the duty of making women feel at home on a campus in which freshmen eat every meal in Annenberg under the stern gaze of dozens of white men.
Harvard has not had any similarly notable instances of misogyny, but that does not make our campus a bastion of gender equality. After all, women were not even recognized as students of Harvard University, as opposed to Radcliffe College, until 1977. We are heavily underrepresented in math and science courses, and we are regularly treated as objects at final club parties. In light of this, the recent events at Yale only underscore the continued importance of women’s resources at Harvard.
Men and women across the country have joined together in condemning the actions of DKE. I am glad that I am not alone in my horror and outrage about such a disgustingly misogynistic event. However, I am distressed by Harvard’s attitude of complacency. Harvard’s feminist organizations should participate more actively in the national dialogue about the DKE affair. But more importantly, everyone at Harvard should learn from this incident at our sister Ivy. After all, if it could happen in New Haven, it could happen here as well.

CORRECTION: November 15, 2010
An earlier version of the Nov. 12 op-ed "When No Means Yes" incorrectly reported that female undergraduates were students of Radcliffe College, not Harvard University, until 1999. In fact, they became students of Harvard University in 1977, although they still received Radcliffe diplomas in addition to Harvard diplomas until 1999. The Crimson regrets the error.

Chances are you’ve heard of Firesheep, the web plug-in that lets anybody access other people’s Facebook and Twitter accounts over the same wireless network. The application is dangerous but eye-opening, and it may redefine the Internet as we know it.
Don’t be put off by its silly name, which is a bad pun on the offbeat title of the browser it enhances, Firefox. If anything, the names of the two programs should be reversed, as it is the Firesheep users who prey upon the great, defenseless herds of the Internet. It may soon reach the point, however, when the legions of lazy hackers outnumber their victims. The software was downloaded more than 104,000 times in the first 24 hours, and it has grown to at least 700,000 this week.
Concern over Firesheep has quickly spread across Harvard in the past few weeks, including a community advisory email from FAS-IT and a demonstration in CS 50 showing how easy it is to access someone’s Facebook account. The plug-in reminds us how often we simply trust that communication is confidential, when the opposite is typically true. Most websites perform the obvious step of encrypting login information with SSL, but that is where security ends. Encryption is expensive, so many websites simply use cookies to keep track of the active session with the user after they have logged in. Since all data over an open wireless network is broadcast freely to everyone within range, other users can intercept these cookies once the session is in progress and use them to do anything that the initial user is able to do.
Hijacking cookies after a session has started, called “sidejacking” in geek parlance, has always been easy for those in the know. Firesheep merely democratizes the process, making it available to spiteful exes, mischievous pre-teens, and disgruntled coworkers everywhere.
Given that Firesheep is most effective at targeting social websites, it can’t do much damage in coffee shops or Internet cafes, since people can only spy on the random strangers who happen to be there. The plug-in is far more devastating in places where everybody knows everybody else, such as college classrooms and libraries. In other words, we have the most to lose.
Though the legality of sidejacking is hardly clear, the plug-in has spurred some grandiose ethical debates on the nature of evil. Is it wrong to use Firesheep just to see what it’s like? Are Firesheep users born evil, or do they have evilness thrust upon them? Or, more common among Harvard students, if Firesheep can’t access Gmail, then what’s the big deal?
Firesheep’s creator Eric Butler claims that he released the client merely to expose the security problems with unencrypted data sent over a wireless network. I believe him about as much as I believe the Joker when he tells Batman that he’s just conducting a social experiment.
Although Firesheep has yet to lead to major changes at targeted websites—Twitter has said that switching to SSL won’t happen for a few months—it has led to escalation, as other hackers attempt to fight Firesheep with fire. Butler was responsible enough to post the source code to Firesheep on his website, and understanding the nitty-gritty details about how it operates has allowed rival plug-ins to turn Firesheep’s own algorithms against it. However, such countermeasures, like the plug-in Blacksheep, can only detect Firesheep activity, not stop it, and they do nothing to prevent other sidejacking attacks.
In providing average citizens with ammunition, Butler has contributed to the increasing militarization of the Internet. Regardless of his motives, releasing Firesheep has generated the same mixture of fear, confusion, and general hilarity associated with the Anonymous movement and its various hacker collectives, like 4chan. These hacker groups have been attacking a range of targets, from white supremacist Hal Turner to teen sensation Justin D. Bieber, for most of the decade, and while their victims tend to be people most Harvard students love to hate, innocents can get caught in the crossfire. For instance, Apple’s stock price dropped significantly in 2008 when 4chan pranksters posted a fake entry on CNN’s iReport that Steven P. Jobs had suffered a heart attack.
The way to respond to such juvenile bomb-throwers is not to stoop to their level, either through countermeasures like Blacksheep or the CS 50-endorsed HTTPS Everywhere, nor is it to wait patiently until websites institute SSL everywhere. Instead, concerned citizens should push their governments to require mandatory encryption for any websites that traffic in sensitive information.
Firehseep, though crude in its methods, does an admirable job of revealing just how insecure most of the Internet really is. Trust permeates the web to its core, which may have been fine when it was a tiny academic playground, but it is entirely unacceptable today. Before the Internet further devolves into a battlefield for rival hackers, some adults should step in to clean up the mess.

Walk up to floor five of the Sackler, turn right and go through the first room to the smaller second chamber. On the far wall, sketches for Giambattista Piranesi’s Carceri d’Invenzione are on display. The 18th-century etchings of labyrinthine subterranean prisons are said to have come to Piranesi in a fever vision—in the completed series of 16 plates, staircases loop round solid cylindrical towers, and before stone walkways cross half-drawn gangplanks. Outside the frame, vaulted chambers continue without end. Here and there individuals are visible, murkily silhouetted.
It’s worth losing oneself occasionally in the gloom of these images, simply because of their nightmarish beauty. Today, though, Piranesi’s visions seemed especially striking, if only as contrast. Nearly 50,000 people attended a national demonstration in London on Wednesday to protest the proposed British university tuition fee hike from £3,290 to £9,000; in a widely printed photograph, students who have gained access to the roof of 30 Millbank are darkly visible against the skyline. As with the Piranesi image, the viewer sees them from below; as with the vaults, the looming building—Tory headquarters—extends past the photo’s edges. But here no individuals wander alone in a world of fantastic machines. Instead, the silhouettes are clustered close, gesturing to each another, talking, clapping.
Moments like these are the moving side of the protest, which has been both inspiring and frustrating to follow from this side of the Atlantic. What’s inspiring has been the social cohesion of British students in making their voices heard against what for many will be a devastating increase in tuition. It’s difficult to find an analogue to that feeling on this campus, where several student editorials in the past weeks have catalogued feelings of either boredom or apathy. Although the usual fears were at work in London—students were worried about “kettling,” the controversial police procedure of last year’s G20 demonstration in which people were squeezed together in a small space and denied exit—there was also a sense of fun. The importance of the issue and excitement of the protest made students feel they were in something together.
That feeling of unity partly plays off the rhetorical contradictions of the Conservative Party’s 2010 “Big Society” platform, which aspires to “take power away from politicians and give it to people.” The policy is intended to cut government spending and encourage private organizations to take over the bulk of community social initiatives. But listen to U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron himself: the Big Society is “about liberation, the biggest, most dramatic redistribution of power from elites in Whitehall to the man and woman on the street.” Right now, the “man and woman on the street” are university students.
More frustrating has been the violence, the focus of the media’s attention. A few fires were started; a window  was shattered. That disappointing end may have had to do with the protest’s inarticulateness of vision—one of the problems with the event, organized by the National Union of Students, was that it failed to offer any concrete counterproposal. (The event slogan was “Fund Our Future.”) The circumstances themselves remain nebulous: How much violence actually was there? In the news the same scenes are projected over and over. Who exactly was responsible? The finger’s been pointed at everyone from Cambridge University undergraduates to anarchists. The challenge now is how to channel group-feeling into rational activity.
In a very good essay on Piranesi, Aldous Huxley points out the special role that the isolated figures play. The effect of their presence is to further magnify the size of the enormous monuments: “Men and women are reduced to the stature of small children; horses become little larger than mastiffs. Inside the basilicas, the pious reach up to the holy water fonts and, even on tiptoe, can hardly wet their fingers. Peopled by dwarfs, even the most modest of baroque buildings assumes heroic proportions; a little piece of classicism by Pietro da Cortona seems gravely portentous, and the delightful gimcrack of Borromini takes on a Cyclopean quality.”
Kicking in the windows at Tory headquarters was just the opposite, a literal attempt to bring down to scale the buildings of “Big Society” government. What students are really saying, if less articulately than they might, is that it is possible to work together, that they needn’t break into isolated individuals or communities—and that, standing beside government institutions, one shouldn’t ever feel small.

The Harvard Square Homeless Shelter hosted a panel discussion Wednesday that focused on a College alumnus’ new book about the organization.
The book, “Shelter: Where Harvard Meets the Homeless,” was written by Scott C. Seider ’99, who volunteered at the shelter from 1995 to 1999 while he was an undergraduate.
Seider, who moderated the discussion, began the event by sharing his thoughts on how college-aged students are able to impact the lives of the homeless in a way no other demographic can.
“College is the peak period of optimism and idealism for students,” Seider said, explaining why he believes a shelter run by undergraduate students can be successful. “Students aren’t just patient with the guests—they’re enthusiastic.”
Recalling the help he received from the Homeless Shelter as one of its former guests, George Caponigro, echoed similar sentiments.
Caponigro said that part of the organization’s strength is the willingness of its student volunteers to connect with the shelter’s guests.At one point during his stay, he said, two undergraduates volunteering at the shelter asked him to write letters of recommendation for their post-college endeavors.
“That made me feel like I was worth something,” Caponigro said. “I owe so much to this place.”
According to Seider, working at the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter—which, he said, is the only student-run homeless shelter in the nation—has a profound effect on the students who volunteer.
“It kind of ruins you for life,” said Reverend John H. Finley IV ’92 with a chuckle. “Once you realize what it feels like to be needed and useful, it’s hard to go back.”
Finley, who once volunteered at the shelter, continues working in a community-oriented capacity, having helped found a tuition-free private school in Dorchester for students hailing from disadvantaged communities.
The packed audience at the discussion included current and past volunteers.
Whitney W. Donaldson ’12, who has volunteered at the shelter for the past three years and is now a supervisor, spoke enthusiastically about her experience.
“It’s been one of the most important and impactful experiences I’ve had at school,” she said. “There is no other group on campus I would rather be involved with.”

A man unaffiliated with Harvard was robbed at gunpoint in the Yard yesterday at 2:45 a.m., according to a community advisory e-mailed to the Harvard affiliates yesterday morning by the Harvard University Police Department.
According to the advisory, the suspect approached the victim and asked for the time as the victim was walking near Thayer Hall. When the victim responded, the suspect displayed a handgun and demanded the victim’s wallet.
The suspect fled the area after the victim, who was not injured, handed over his wallet, according to HUPD’s e-mail.
The victim described the suspect as a thin, Hispanic male in his 20s with facial hair and roughly 5’9” tall. At the time of the robbery, the suspect was wearing dark clothing, including a black baseball hat, according to the victim.
This incident, which is the fifth armed robbery on or close to the Harvard campus in the past two weeks, marks the first in which a victim was held at gunpoint.
In light of the location of this incident—in the Yard, the heart of the College campus—students voiced concerns about campus safety.
“I was under the impression that Harvard was a safe campus, and that was one of the main reasons I came to Harvard,” said Michael L. Wang ’14, who lives in Thayer. “Now I felt unsafe to go to CVS.”
According to HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano, HUPD has “increased visibility and patrols in and around the Yard area.”
David E. Burdette ’14, who also lives in Thayer, said he and his friends might have encountered the suspect before the robbery took place early yesterday morning.
Burdette said that he saw a person matching the suspect’s description yelling at several employees at CVS around 1:30 a.m. Later, as Burdette and his friends walked past Johnston Gate, they saw the same person, who began yelling at Burdette and his group. Burdette added that his group immediately phoned HUPD after the encounter.

The American College of Radiology has designated Mount Auburn Hospital a “Breast Imaging Center of Excellence” for the second consecutive year.
The designation certifies that the hospital is accredited in both mandatory and voluntary modules for breast imaging, including mammography, stereotactic breast biopsy, and breast ultrasound.
According to the ACR, the hospital is one of only 526 hospitals nation-wide and 28 hospitals in Massachusetts to have received the designation as of Nov. 1.
In total, more than 5,800 hospitals were registered in the U.S. as of 2008, according to the American Association of Hospitals.
Now recognized as a “Breast Imaging Center of Excellence,” Mount Auburn Hospital is certified to offer a high standard of equipment and services that will enable it to better detect breast cancer and continue its goal of improving women’s health and the quality of afflicted women’s lives.
The process of breast imaging is crucial to detecting and treating breast cancer.
“With the onset of mammography screening, the death rate from advanced breast cancer that had been unchanged for the preceding 50 years has decreased by 30 percent since 1990. Moreover, early mammography screening means cancers can be caught sooner, often allowing women to choose less invasive treatments that help to preserve the quality of women’s lives as well,” according to the ACR website.
The press release issued by Mount Auburn Hospital reiterated the institution’s strengths and services in breast imaging that combat breast cancer.
“As a ‘Breast Imaging Center of Excellence,’ the Women’s Imaging Center has proved its high practice standards in image quality, personnel qualifications, facility equipment, quality control procedures, and quality assurance programs,” read the press release, which was issued after ACR notified the hospital of its designation.
Jeanette Clough, who serves as Mount Auburn Hospital’s president and CEO, said in the press release that the distinction was “a great honor.”
“We are thrilled to be recognized for our dedication and commitment to the early detection of breast cancer,” she added.

Tyler R. Giannini, clinical director of the Law School’s Human Rights Program, has recently been appointed a clinical professor of law at HLS.
Giannini, who was formerly a lecturer on law, lectures on business, human rights law, and the intersection of human rights and the environment.
“Since he has been at Harvard, he has been an outstanding teacher, loved by his students, and [a] central force in our human rights clinic, widely viewed as the best in the country,” James L. Cavallaro ’84, the executive director of the Human Rights Program, wrote in an e-mail.
Before coming to the Law School, Giannini worked with communities in Burma that sued the oil corporation Unocal for human rights abuses. He also co-founded EarthRights International, an organization that focuses on human rights law and the environment.
He has also written several scholarly articles, including “Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climate Change Refugees.”
“Tyler Giannini is a creative thinker and pioneer in the development of theories of liability in the field of human rights,” said Law School Dean Martha L. Minow in a press release. “His work has guided [the International Human Rights Clinic] and our clinical students in ground-breaking and influential work in human rights advocacy.”
Giannini joined the Law School in 2004 as a clinical advocacy fellow in the Human Rights Program. In 2006, Giannini was appointed a lecturer on law. He became clinical director of the Human Rights Program in 2007.
Cavallaro said that Giannini’s appointment represents “a step forward for the Law School,” and sends a message about “the importance of teaching in decisions about tenure and status at Harvard Law School.”
With the International Human Rights Clinic, Giannini has worked on Alien Tort Statute cases. He is currently serving as co-counsel in South African apartheid litigation, and in Mamani v. Sanchez de Lozada, a case dealing with the roles of a former Bolivian president and a former defense minister in a 2003 civilian massacre.
Giannini has led teams of clinical students litigating in Bolivia, Canada, Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, Thailand, South Africa, and South Korea.
Currently overseas, Giannini could not be reached for comment.

Harvard Law School Professor Jody Freeman has been tapped to serve as a public member of the Council of the Administrative Conference of the United States.
Freeman will work with 50 senior federal officials and experts in administrative law to find innovative approaches to improving bureaucratic processes.
The ACUS is an independent, non-partisan government agency that works to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of federal agencies through applied research.
Freeman served in the White House from 2009 to 2010 as Counselor for Energy and Climate Change. She spearheaded a proposal to create national fuel efficiency standards and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
“What a superb recognition of Jody’s leadership, knowledge, and imagination,” said Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow, according to a press release. “We are delighted that the Administrative Conference will have the benefit of Jody’s recent experience in Washington, where her work on American energy and climate change issues included interagency collaborations, and an historic agreement among the auto industry, California, and key stakeholders on federal fuel efficiency standards and federal greenhouse gas standards.”
Freeman also worked on policy initiatives related to renewable energy, offshore drilling, and transmission policy.
“I got to see how government agencies work up close from the perspective of the White House,” Freeman said. “I worked very closely with different agencies and had a window into the things that work well and the things that don’t work so well.”
Freeman said she looks forward to finding collaborative approaches that draw from both the public and private sectors to improve the functioning of federal agencies.
At the Law School, Freeman founded the Environmental Law and Policy Program. She teaches environmental law, and was appointed to an endowed chair in public law named after Archibald Cox, Jr., the former Solicitor General under President John F. Kennedy ’40 and first special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal.
Freeman’s new position will not interfere with her teaching at HLS, where she said she “loves being back in the classroom.” She added that her experience in the White House has made her teaching “much richer.”
The ACUS was established in 1964, until it was terminated briefly because of funding shortages in 1995. Congress reauthorized the conference in 2004 and 2008.

Harvard’s $601 million bond sale on Tuesday raised 20 percent less than had been planned earlier, as rising interest rates led to a decision to shrink the size of the deal.
The bonds were priced at a premium, with 10-year bonds yielding 2.54 percent—20 basis points lower than the benchmark for AAA-rated institutions on municipal debt due in 10 years, according to Bloomberg.
While overall interest rates remain low, rates on longer-dated tax-exempt municipal bonds such as those issued by Harvard rose about 10 to 13 basis points on Tuesday, due to inflationary concerns spurred by the Federal Reserve’s announcement to buy back $600 billion in Treasury bonds. The movement in rates increases the cost of borrowing for the University.
University spokesman John D. Longbrake said that Harvard viewed the bond offering as a success.
“Deals are commonly resized based on market conditions, especially when the issuer has flexibility in its financing strategies,” Longbrake said.
The bonds—which were issued through the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency—will refinance long-term debt and pay construction costs for the renovation of the Fogg Museum.
Morgan Stanley served as lead underwriter.
Last week, Harvard sold $300 million of taxable 30-year bonds.
In all, the recent bond issuances will bring Harvard’s total outstanding debt to $6.6 billion, more than double the amount on the University’s books in 2006.
Harvard’s last bond sale in December 2008 raised $2.5 billion at the height of the financial crisis, as the University faced various liquidity demands and sought to alleviate them by tapping the bond markets.
Harvard retained its AAA credit rating from both Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s, reflecting the rating agencies’ continued faith in the University’s finances. A strong credit rating allows Harvard to raise capital more easily and cheaply from the debt markets.
Though Harvard’s endowment suffered a heavy blow during the financial crisis, investment returns reached 11 percent in fiscal year 2010.
As University finances have increasingly stabilized, Harvard is rethinking its financial strategy for the next few years.
For one, Harvard intends to decrease its capital spending for the next two years, according to both rating agencies.
And in 2009, University President Drew G. Faust announced that Harvard would cut as much as half of its capital budget and expressed plans to depart from Harvard’s usual method of financing new construction by borrowing.
Currently, the University has relied more heavily on private donations to finance building projects, including construction at the Law School, the renovation of the Fogg, and ongoing building projects in Allston.
In addition, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp is implementing a new capital planning process that will involve centralizing decisions about the optimal use of financial resources.

In recognition of Veterans Day, a coalition of student groups sponsored a community service outing to a local nursing home, where undergraduates, veterans, and non-veterans spent yesterday afternoon.
The Harvard co-sponsors of the event—Hillel, the Catholic Student Association, and the Harvard-Radcliffe Christian Fellowship—have a history of working together on community service projects and chose to spend this year’s Veterans Day at the Cambridge Nursing and Rehab Center, formerly known as Vernon Hall Nursing Home.
“We really wanted to do something that focused on our senior citizens, those from the generations that fought our wars,” said Matthew P. Cavedon ’11, one of CSA’s vice presidents. “I hope that we gave them something by showing them what we’ve been able to do with the peace, security, and freedom that they’ve provided.”
Once Cavedon, other Harvard visitors, and a few residents had gathered in a dining room, students and senior citizens played games, ate snacks, and mingled with one another.
During the afternoon celebration, the groups took a moment to recognize the veterans among them and the their service to the country. One World War II veteran recounted his experiences, both good and bad, of traveling across Africa and Italy, meeting the pope, and losing fellow soldiers.

Graduate school applications are expected to surge again this year, according to a survey released by test prep company Kaplan on Tuesday.
As is expected in a difficult labor market created by a recession, many laid-off workers and recent graduates are considering graduate school as their best strategy, said Lee Weiss, who is assistant director of pre-graduate programs at Kaplan.
The survey was conducted shortly after the Educational Testing Service—the administrator of the Graduate Record Exam—announced that it will be unveiling a completely new GRE exam next August.
The Kaplan survey results showed that 78 percent of graduate schools expect an increase in the number of applicants, maintaining the momentum of the 8-percent growth in the total number of applicants from 2008 to 2009.
Reflecting this trend, Harvard Law School has seen an increase from 7,168 applicants in 2008 to 7,610 in 2010.
These increases speak to growing frustration with the current job market, and they will also lead to a more competitive admissions process, according to Kaplan.
Additionally, the Kaplan survey found that there has been a 53-percent increase from two years ago among students applying to graduate school immediately after college.
“A lot of people are uncertain about their futures,” Weiss said. “The increase demonstrates that many students aren’t that optimistic about job opportunities.”
The upcoming change in the GRE test will be highly significant for future applicants, since 30 percent of graduate schools still consider it to be the most important admission factor, according to the Kaplan survey.
Weiss also said that while the test change will amount to the biggest in the GRE’s history, many college admissions programs don’t know much about the new test, and 77 percent polled don’t know if it will be a better predictor of a student’s ability.
Students who take the current GRE will still have valid test scores for the next five years, Weiss noted.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Crystal D. Trejo ’13 was active in student council in high school, she remembers a scene dominated by girls. But when she was elected to the Undergraduate Council as a Quincy House representative after this September’s general elections, Trejo became one of only 12 women of 51 total members of the Council.
Even after adding one new female representative in a special election last month, women make up just a quarter of the UC, the main representative body that serves as a liaison between students and administrators.
After years of acknowledging the problem in the abstract, the results of this year’s elections “blindsided” UC leaders, according to Student Relations Committee Chair Ashley M. Fabrizio ’11.
Featuring a slight drop in female representation—from 16 to 12 women members—and the election of only one female freshman representative, this fall provided a telling reminder that the UC’s gender representation issue is far from solved.
In response to the gender imbalance on the Council this year, over the past two months, the UC has begun investigating the causes of the skewed gender ratio. But as the semester’s end approaches, it remains unclear what specific recommendations the Council will make and how these measures will affect the gender breakdown of the Council.
A BOYS’ CLUB?
Though women comprise at least half of the student body at the College, female candidates have accounted for one-third of the Council’s membership for the past few terms. And of the 15 UC presidents to serve since the top position was opened to student body election in 1996, only five have been women.
This trend may be isolated to the UC, according to Susan B. Marine, director of the Harvard College Women’s Center. Marine, who is also the UC’s faculty advisor, says the Women’s Center has found that, in recent years, women undergraduates serve in leadership positions in roughly equal proportion to men.
In interviews with The Crimson over the past month, Council representatives and leaders, both men and women, agreed that they did not think disproportionate female representation has significantly affected the Council’s ability to address the needs of Harvard women. Both Fabrizio and UC Secretary Bonnie Cao ’12—two of the three women on the UC executive board, which includes 12 members in total—say that the Council’s male-dominated membership does not hinder the way the UC deals with student issues.
But, according to Marine, it is impossible to know the true effects of the lack of female representation.
“I think if women are not in the room, it’s probably fairly obvious that women’s perspectives are not being represented,” she says. “That doesn’t mean male representatives can’t make an effort. But having women in the room is invaluable when addressing women’s issues on campus.”
SELLING YOURSELF
During her campaign for UC representative this fall, Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 knocked on every door in Crimson Yard twice—a meet-the-voters campaign tactic that few other women candidates conducted, she adds. Even though 28 women ran for 12 Yard positions for the UC, Zhu was the only freshman woman to be elected.
Council insiders including Fabrizio have pointed to such a campaign strategy, in which candidates personally visit the dorms of a quarter or more of the freshman class, as a partial explanation for the lack of women representation in the Council. Freshmen vote for the people they know, Zhu says. And for freshmen—who are just a few weeks into their Harvard careers during the fall UC elections—that person is often the most visible candidate.
“Because the election period is so short, you basically have to be a really aggressive go-getter, and to have the nerve to go door-to-door and sell yourself,” says Cao, who is currently running for UC vice president.
Cao says she worries that analyzing the issue of gender imbalance may devolve into perpetuating stereotypes about gender roles. But Hannah Riley Bowles, an associate professor at the Kennedy School who studies gender and leadership, says that research has exposed the influence of generalizations about gender in elections. According to Bowles, the door-to-door technique that Cao, Fabrizio, and Zhu have found successful requires candidates to be “self-promoters”—a trait that people generally find “socially unattractive” in women, she adds.
“We don’t like it when women say, ‘I should do this because I’m smart and political,’” Bowles says.
NOT A CERTAIN “TYPE”
When she first arrived at Harvard, Cao—the only woman currently running for UC president or vice president—says she initially decided to abandon her high school commitment to student government, thinking the UC just wasn’t the right fit for her.
“In my naive freshman head, I thought the people who run for the UC at Harvard are the future senators and super-intense people,” Cao says.
Because there are few visible women in student and even national government leadership positions, Marine says she worries that a lack of role models prevents undergraduate women from seeing themselves as viable candidates. Both Fabrizio and Cao say they needed encouragement from peers and UC leaders before they felt ready to be on the UC ballot.
According to Bowles, the phenomenon of even the most qualified women candidates shying away from the public arena is pervasive in politics. In fact, Bowles adds, the average woman is less likely to run for office than an equally qualified man, given the social pressures on women candidates. But there might be a simple solution to reversing the problem for the UC: simply asking every Council member to approach two or three women as potential candidates could ease women’s anxiety about running for leadership positions, Bowles says.
“It’s more risky for women than men to put themselves out there and self-promote,” Bowles says. “When a woman gets asked to run, she can say that [she is] running because of other people. The biggest bang for your buck is asking women to run.”
THINKING STRATEGICALLY
This fall’s UC election is not the first time Council leadership has worked to amend gender imbalance. For the past few years, the UC has tried to encourage women to run by hosting campaign workshops at the Women’s Center.
According to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11, the Council has recently taken additional measures to address the problem. Last month, Council leaders organized a meeting with active members of the Women’s Center to discuss skewed gender representation. Cao says that the Council will consider the proposals that came out of the meeting, which include actively recruiting women to run for the Council and hosting workshops on effective campaigning for women.
Fabrizio adds that the UC will also target women to run in special elections to fill open seats and as upperclassman candidates in House elections—both of which, for freshmen, take place after the pressures of being new to Harvard dissipates. Already this year, one new woman has joined the Council through a special election victory.
“I think this year is an especially stark reminder that we can’t just offer one campaign workshop in the Women’s Center and think that will solve it,” Marine says. “We are starting to think strategically.”

Harvard Law School Professor Noah R. Feldman ’92 discussed his new book, which explores the battling personalities of four Supreme Court Justices appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt ’04, at the Law School Wednesday night.
Feldman’s book, titled “Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of FDR’s Great Supreme Court Justices,” focuses on how the personal lives of the Justices intersected with their roles in shaping legal history.
“They don’t make them like this anymore,” said journalist Christopher Lydon, who hosted the conversation, as he introduced the larger-than-life personalities of the justices.
Feldman said that it was hard to imagine the “Scorpions” being confirmed for the Supreme Court today, given the modern political environment.
“So many people now are disqualified from the Supreme Court the minute they do something controversial or take a strong stance,” he said.
One of the Justices Feldman writes about, Robert Jackson, never graduated from law school, and another, Hugo Black, was once a member of the Ku Klux Klan.
But as Justices, both took strong stances for human rights: Jackson was the chief United States prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials, and Black was instrumental in the Brown v. Board of Education decision, which concluded that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional.
In addition to speaking about legal history, Feldman also commented on the workings of the current Supreme Court, critiquing what he called a system in which the Supreme Court is largely disengaged from public discourse.
“This idealization of the Court is not good for democracy. In a democracy, institutions should be held responsible by the people,” Feldman said.
The “Scorpions” were not perfect people, Feldman added, but they nevertheless left great legal legacies.
“We also need flawed people for results,” he said.
According to Feldman, legal scholars have criticized his book for focusing on personalities rather than scholarship, but as long as “personality shapes the context of legal ideas, it’s not trivial,” Feldman said.
Christina R. Krushen, a second-year graduate student who audited a class with Feldman and attended the event, said she agreed with Feldman’s stance.
“We talked about these justices in the context of their legal opinions, and it was interesting to hear about them in their personal lives,” she said.
“It opens up these ideas to a nonlegal audience,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As winter begins to creep over Cambridge, anticipation builds for the encore to the most successful season in the history of Harvard men’s basketball. Last year, the Crimson finished 21-8—the first time in school history that the team has won more than 20 games—and advanced to the postseason for the first time in over 60 years.
But for Harvard, one thing remained elusive. Despite climbing from a 6-8 conference record in 2008-09 to 10-4 last year, the Crimson was once again unable to claim the Ivy League title, finishing in third place in the Ancient Eight standings behind Cornell and Princeton.
This year’s team hopes to succeed where none of its predecessors have before and claim the first-ever Ivy League championship in school history.
“Like everyone else, we are solely striving to be the best we can be every year,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker says. “Every season is different. It’s a new group and a new year this season with players taking on new roles.”
The end of last year heralded the departure of four seniors from the team, including two-time first-team All-Ivy League selection Jeremy Lin ’10, whose success has carried him into the NBA, where he plays for his hometown Golden State Warriors.
The loss of the class of 2010 leaves the Crimson without any seniors on its roster. The leadership roles now rest upon the shoulders of junior co-captains Oliver McNally and Keith Wright.
“Last year, we could get picked up by Jeremy or one of the older guys that had been there for a few years,” McNally says. “[This year] our juniors are the oldest guys. Luckily, we’ve played a lot in our first couple of years, and the sophomores played a lot last year, so we’re not as young as we may appear.”
Harvard returns eight members from last year’s squad, including five of its top six scorers. Among them is the reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, sophomore forward Kyle Casey.
The injury bug bit Casey this offseason, as the sophomore went down with a broken right foot that will sideline him for the start of the season.
In Casey’s absence, Harvard’s frontcourt will be anchored by junior forward Keith Wright, who will be joined by an inexperienced cast featuring junior Andrew Van Nest, sophomore Jeff Georgatos, and freshman Ugo Okam.
But the Crimson’s biggest strength lies in its backcourt. Returning sophomores Brandyn Curry and Christian Webster will likely join McNally in the starting lineup and look to push the tempo.
Together the group will undertake what may be the toughest schedule in Harvard history.
This season, the Crimson will have to contend with four teams from BCS conferences, with three games on the road. The team goes to Michigan on Dec. 4, Connecticut on Dec. 22, and Boston College on Jan. 5. Harvard will also face Colorado at home on Nov. 28.
“We have played Michigan since I’ve been here,” says Amaker, who coached the Wolverines from 2001-07. “It’s another game that is going to be incredibly challenging with playing an opponent at that level, especially being a marquee program in the Big Ten.”
“We would love to keep playing Boston College each year, especially since they are so close and local,” he adds. “It brings a local rivalry and creates a buzz in Boston.”
These matchups make up one of the most difficult non-conference schedules that the Crimson has ever undertaken, but the road to the Ivy League championship is by no means a smooth one either.
The Crimson will have to surpass Cornell and Princeton, as well as a much-improved Penn team, in order to claim its first-ever conference title. Both the Big Red and the Tigers finished ahead of Harvard in last year’s standings, as the Crimson went winless against the pair—its only Ivy losses.
Though Cornell is the three-time defending league champion, the Big Red lost three first-team All-Ivy players in center Jeff Foote, guard Louis Dale, and forward Ryan Wittman, the Ivy League Player of the Year. Cornell should remain competitive with the return of junior guard Chris Wroblewski and the development of sophomore forward Errick Peck, but most media outlets are not anticipating a fourth straight title for the Big Red.
The preseason favorite is Princeton, which returns the top five scorers from a team that went 21-8 last year—including the veteran backcourt duo of junior Douglas Davis and senior Dan Mavraides, both of whom are among the league’s top six returning scorers.
With the Quakers also expecting a revival from a miserable 2009-10 season in which they went 6-22, Harvard’s quest for its first Ivy crown will be a challenge.
“We have a little more work this year,” McNally admits. “We [are] really just focused on getting better every day…We look forward to continue doing that and win some games this year hopefully.”

In 2009-10, the Harvard women’s basketball team finished its season with a 20-9 overall record while going 11-3 in league play.  With that record, the Crimson earned a second-place finish behind Princeton in the Ivy League standings, sending the team to its second consecutive Women’s National Invitation Tournament berth.
Unfortunately for Harvard, the young Crimson team’s postseason run ended quickly with an 87-68 loss to Syracuse in the first round of the WNIT.
After back-to-back second-place finishes in the Ivy League, Harvard looks to improve upon last year’s solid season and earn its 12th Ivy League title, which would be the team’s first since the Crimson earned a share of the crown in 2008.
“Our main goal is always to win an Ivy League championship,” co-captain Christine Matera says. “We’re taking the season one game at a time, and hopefully it will lead us to that.”
Encouraged by last season, Harvard is optimistic about the coming winter.
“Preseason has been going well so far,” Matera says. “We have focused a lot on rebounding and the defensive end of things. Our scrimmages have gone well, so everyone is really excited for [the start of the season].”
Because last year’s Crimson team did not have any seniors, Harvard boasts the return of 12 seasoned veterans, who will be aided by a strong class of four incoming freshmen for the 2010-11 campaign.
“It’s definitely a positive for our team to have everyone coming back,” junior guard Brogan Berry says. “Last year, we were still very young and trying to learn each other’s strengths…We’re a bit stronger now. We know each other’s roles better, and the four freshmen we have are fitting in nicely.”
Included in the long list of returners for the Crimson are three All-Ivy selections: Berry, sophomore guard Victoria Lippert, and senior forward Emma Markley. Sophomore guard Jasmine Evans, who missed last season due to injury, is now healthy and should add speed and athleticism to the Harvard lineup.
The Crimson had a deep bench last year, with nine different players scoring at least 90 points on the season. The team claimed the top spot in the Ivy League in three-point field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage, blocks, assists, and three-point field goals made.
But as solid as Harvard looks, the Crimson is not the only team that will return a strong nucleus of players for the upcoming season.
The Tigers, who are favored to defend last year’s title with another first-place finish, also return all five starters, including sophomore guard Niveen Rasheed, who was named Ivy League Rookie of the Year last season.
“In the Ivy League, we’re looking at Princeton as some tough competition,” Matera says. “They went undefeated in the league last year. They’re coming off of a great season and have everyone back, so we’re really looking to go out and try to beat them.”
In the 2010-11 Ivy League Women’s Basketball Preseason Media/SID poll, Harvard was picked to finish the season in second place for the third straight year.
Two of the Crimson’s three league losses last year came against the Tigers, while Dartmouth—a team looking to return as a contender this season—split games with Harvard.
Though ranked seventh in the Ivy League in points allowed, the Crimson dominated in scoring with Berry, Lippert, Matera, and Markley each averaging more than 10 points per game.
Harvard played especially well with homecourt advantage, winning 12 contests and losing just one at Lavietes Pavilion.
Though Ivy League play does not begin until January, the Crimson starts off its season tomorrow at Maine. Before Harvard meets the Big Green in its first league game, the Crimson will have to take on a tough non-conference schedule that includes six teams involved in postseason play last year.
“It’s important to play teams that challenge us to get some good experience,” Berry says. “You only get one, two bad games, and you’re out of the Ivy League run, so it’s crucial that you have a hard non-conference schedule to prepare you.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In sports, any successful team is ultimately driven by good leadership. For the Harvard women’s basketball team, good leadership will be decided by a duo of talented seniors who have three previous years to guide them.
Christine Matera and Jackie Alemany will lead a troupe of veteran players in an attempt to leave a lasting legacy by winning an oft-elusive Ivy League title.
In many ways, being at the end of their basketball careers brings each captain back to where she began.
For both Matera and Alemany, basketball has been a lifelong commitment.
“I’ve been playing since I was four or five,” Alemany says. “My dad…had always loved basketball...and introduced me to it. I’ve basically been competitive from the womb.”
Matera, who used to tag along to her older brother’s basketball practices—which happened to be coached by her father—grew up in a family of athletes.
“I can’t really remember a time when I wasn’t playing basketball,” the New Jersey native says. “I played a lot of sports growing up, but my focus ended up being basketball really early. It’s always been my passion.”
This love for basketball brought both Matera and Alemany to Harvard, where, under the coaching of Kathy Delaney-Smith, they built careers that emphasized consistency rather than flashy performance. Matera brought her shooting skills, and Alemany brought her defensive and rebounding effort—talents that distinguished the two Crimson players in the Ivy League.
As a junior last season, Matera led not only Harvard but also the conference in three-pointers made with 2.5 per game. Alemany was eighth and 10th in the Ancient Eight for rebounding and assists, respectively.
Despite their impressive individual accolades, Alemany and Matera have gained more than personal achievements.
“It’s definitely been a positive experience in my life, although it hasn’t been easy,” Alemany says, when speaking about her four years on the team. “There have been ups and downs, as with anything in which you invest this much time. But I love my coaches, and I love my class.”
“It’s been a growing experience,” Matera echoes, “but it’s been a great experience playing under Kathy [Delaney-Smith], who is one of the best coaches in the Ivy League, and for a program that has a history of being one of the best.”
The knowledge the seniors gained in the early part of their careers has been influential as they rose to the position of captain, something the underclassmen have recognized.
“The captains have contributed a lot of guidance in terms of what the coaches want and how our offense and defense should look,” sophomore Elle Hagedorn says. “The underclassmen look to Christine and Jackie for leadership, and we’re looking to see how they act on and off the court.”
Hagedorn is one of the 12 returning players this season, making up the same core from the last season’s roster, one that did not graduate any seniors. The returners posted a 20-9 overall record last year, and Harvard made its eighth postseason appearance and second straight run in the WNIT.
The new freshmen, though, have jumped right into action and, with the help of the captains, have fit into their new team.
“The freshmen have come in and are so talented and eager to do well,” Alemany says. “They’ve all been tough about injuries, and everyone has the same goal. It’s easy when everyone is on the same page.”
In spite of the team’s success last year and its current preseason second-place Ivy League ranking, Matera and Alemany want to do better and leave a winning legacy, especially after having shared the Ivy title with Dartmouth and Cornell during their rookie year.
“The seniors haven’t had the chance to go to the NCAA tournament,” Matera says. “We’re looking to win the Ivy League outright and go to the tournament this season. It’s the one thing we’re really focused on and definitely within our grasp.”
“When we came in as freshmen, we had the idea that we would go to the NCAA tournament and get Ivy rings,” Alemany adds. “We haven’t yet, and this is our last chance, so we really want to capitalize on our potential and talent. We want to finish strong.”
With the return of last year’s core, the introduction of new talent, and the leadership of the captains to bring the team together, this may finally be the season where Matera and Alemany win their long-awaited trip to The Dance.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Second chances are hard to come by, but the Harvard women’s basketball team has the rare opportunity to build on a second-place finish in the Ivy League with all the same players—not to mention a few additions.
“It’s great having everyone back,” sophomore forward Victoria Lippert says. “We’re united in our collective goal of winning an Ivy championship...so we’re all here for that mission of hanging up another banner in the gym. Being back together for another year, I think, is only going to help us.”
Because there were no seniors on the team last year, the Crimson knew going into the 2009-10 season that its campaign could potentially be a test run for what could happen this season. The squad featured then-sophomore Brogan Berry and then-junior Emma Markley, two players who provided a one-two punch on offense. Then-junior co-captain Christine Matera also stepped up as the season progressed, showing off the sharpshooting ability that makes her so lethal.
What came as a pleasant surprise last year was the emergence of Lippert, a versatile forward with the ability to score in a variety of ways. She established herself as another scoring option for Harvard, boosting the Crimson’s reputation as one of the best offenses in the league.
But all that offensive firepower proved to be insufficient, as the squad fought hard throughout the season but finished second behind perennial Ivy League contender Princeton. The Crimson fell twice to the Tigers, the final loss coming towards the end of the season.
That game highlighted one of the team’s season-long weaknesses: the starting lineup, composed of three forwards and two guards, only had two legitimate rebounders in Markley and current co-captain Jackie Alemany. Princeton’s Devona Allgood, playing at center, outmuscled the Crimson backcourt to grab 13 rebounds, eight of which were offensive.
“Rebounding has been focused on in practice since the very first day,” Lippert says. “We’re definitely looking to work on that this year and stop giving away second chances on the offensive board and really focus in on our boxing out.”
The team’s presence in the post only diminished in subsequent postseason play. In the first round of the WNIT, Harvard fell to Syracuse, 87-68, in part due to poor shooting but also due to a lack of rebounding. The Orange collected 50 boards to the Crimson’s 26.
Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has made it a point to her players that she will not tolerate the same discrepancy this time around.
“Rebounding has definitely been something that [our coach] is trying to reiterate, that the captains are trying to reiterate,” Matera comments. “Little things in practice have to do with that. We do extra running [when it comes to] keeping track of rebounds. Missed box-outs we run for. It’s something we’re trying to keep at the forefront.”
The offense, though strong throughout most of the campaign, also made a disappearing act when it was time to face Syracuse. In that game, nine players got significant minutes, but none of them could find the answer to raise the team’s low field-goal percentage. The Orange, on the other hand, shot 58.8 percent on the night.
But both the offseason and preseason training have provided the squad with time to regain the fluidity that the offense exhibited in league play.
“We’re really cohesive on and off the court, and we spend a lot of time together,” Matera says. “Many different people have gotten minutes last year, so we have a lot of experience playing together. This makes everything easier in games, because no matter who subs into the game, you know they’ll be ready to go.”
“[Bringing back everyone] will definitely benefit the team both on and off the court, but especially on the court,” Alemany adds. “We each know our different styles, and it really makes it easier to help the freshmen transition smoothly.”
Even though the team is returning all its core players, four freshmen are projected to contribute to the team’s goals right from the start. Center Elise Gordon and forward Marissa Brock both provide much-needed height to the squad, while guards Christine Clark and Missy Mullins have proven to be scorers from their high school days.
“I would say [the freshmen are] doing a great job,” sophomore guard Elle Hagedorn says. “One or two are coming back from injuries, so they’re a little behind, but all of them have caught on to the plays pretty quickly. They have a pretty good understanding of what the coaches expect of them during practice, which is important, because if they don’t know what the coaches expect of them, we all have to run.”
They had better hit the ground running, because there are no more chances and excuses for an experienced Crimson team, especially if it wants to beat its top Ivy League rival.
“This year, we’re a whole other team,” Lippert remarks. “We have built upon our cohesiveness and our talent from last year, and this year, it’s time to get some revenge on Princeton.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If there’s anyone who can relate to the Harvard football team right now, it’s Bugs Bunny.
Just as he thought he was all set for an easy victory in a basketball game against some annoying pint-sized aliens, it appeared that the Crimson was poised to snatch its 14th Ivy League championship, after it was picked first by the media in the preseason poll earlier this year.
But both the Crimson and the Tune Squad soon realized their opponents were much tougher than expected. The same way a magic basketball turned the aliens into an NBA-caliber lineup, a number of impressive victories have revealed the Quakers to be one of the top FCS teams in the country.
An injury-plagued Harvard has turned to drastic measures, starting three different quarterbacks this season and even making one of its linebackers into a punter.
Like the Looney Tunes, Harvard will have to break out its “Secret Stuff” if it expects to leave Penn with a victory tomorrow.
PRINCETON (1-7, 0-5 Ivy) at YALE (6-2, 4-1)
The Tigers have been overwhelmed by all but the most docile of opponents, with their lone victory coming in double overtime against a Lafayette team that looked more like kittens than Leopards. Allowing Penn to hit the half-century mark with 52 points? It’s as if every time the league starts to forget about Princeton, the Tigers find a way to remind everyone just how bad they are.
The Bulldogs, on the other hand, have been making a different kind of noise. By beating Brown and only losing to the Quakers by seven, Yale has proved itself to be one of the best teams in the league.
PREDICTION: Yale 28, Princeton 7.
CORNELL (2-6, 1-4) at COLUMBIA (3-5, 1-4)
If the Lions are feeling a little depressed after multiple disappointing Ivy losses, a contest against the Big Red seems to offer the perfect cure: an easy home victory against a local-area opponent.
Same state and same record? Yes. Same kind of team? Not even close.
The city slickers barely lost to Yale, while their upstate counterparts barely beat Princeton.
When people tell you they’re going to New York, do they mean they’re headed for the middle of nowhere or one of the most famous cities in the world?
The winner’s spoils will head the same way.
PREDICTION: Columbia 21, Cornell 10.
BROWN (4-4, 3-2) at DARTMOUTH (5-3, 2-3)
After blowing out Harvard, Brown seemed poised to make a run for the title. Instead, the Bears lost All-Ivy quarterback Kyle Newhall-Cabellero to injury and eliminated themselves from contention.
Meanwhile, the Big Green has been surprisingly competitive in league play. Dartmouth lost to Yale by a three-point margin and held Penn to a seven-point game.
While both teams have fallen out of title contention, the Big Green can secure its first winning record in 13 years with a win this weekend.
At this point in the season, the Big Green has more momentum and more motivation than the Bears do.
PREDICTION: Dartmouth 24, Brown 21.
HARVARD (6-2, 4-1) at PENN (7-1, 5-0)
Because the Crimson and the Quakers both boast such strong defenses, this game could rest on the feet of the two kickers: Harvard freshman David Mothander and Penn senior Andrew Samson. Mothander took a step back last weekend in a windy game against Columbia—making only one of three field goal attempts—but his numbers are still better than his Quaker counterpart.
I’m going to go out on a limb and say that the rookie rallies from a subpar game last weekend and nails the kicks that really count.
PREDICTION: Harvard 17, Penn 14.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The fate of Harvard football’s season hangs in the balance this weekend. Tomorrow, the Crimson (6-2, 4-1 Ivy League) travels to the University of Pennsylvania to battle the Quakers (7-1, 5-0) for control of the Ivy League championship race.
“We have a do-or-die mindset right now,” junior cornerback Matthew Hanson said. “Our goal is to win the Ivy League championship. We have to win out, but if we don’t get past Penn, we can’t win the league, so it’s all or nothing for us.”
The Quakers have pounded their way to an undefeated season in the Ancient Eight with 241.5 yards per game on the ground.
“They have a smash-mouth football team,” Hanson said. “They like to run the ball, and they like to stick with the run if they can. [Sophomore quarterback Billy Ragone] can run the ball as well, so our game plan is to stop the run and make Penn throw the ball.”
Ragone earned co-Ivy League Player of the Week honors after Penn’s 52-10 thrashing of Princeton last weekend. Ragone is second on the team in rushing yards with 465 to go along with a 126.4 passer efficiency rating.
Harvard will have to run the ball effectively to keep Ragone and the Quakers off the field—a difficult task considering Penn has the league’s best run defense.
The Quakers have surrendered an average of just 65.2 rushing yards per game.
“We definitely need to be able to run the ball,” junior quarterback Collier Winters said. “Our goal this week is to have 150 yards rushing, and that will allow us to not only move the ball and get in better second and third-down situations, but also to get some play-action plays, which will hopefully spread out the field.”
After playing in three games this year, Winter leads the Crimson with a 64.2 percent completion rate and 549 passing yards, but Harvard will rely on the tailback duo of senior Gino Gordon and sophomore Treavor Scales to guide its ground game.
The league’s second-leading rusher, Gordon has accumulated 913 yards so far this season.
The game pits the Ivy League’s two best offenses against one another, as the Quakers’ 28.1 points per game average is topped only by the Crimson’s 28.9. But on the other side of the ball, Penn has been the stronger squad.
“Obviously, they’re a really good defense,” Winters said. “Watching film on them all this week, they’re really fast. They have a lot of different looks, try to disguise a lot of things, and they’re disciplined as well. They don’t have a lot of breakdowns or give up big plays.”
The Quakers have only allowed an average of 265.2 yards per game, compared to the Crimson’s 309.2—first and second in the Ancient Eight, respectively.
The two teams are also first and second in the league in points allowed and rushing defense, respectively, which could make the game a battle of field position.
Critical to the game’s result will be the play of junior linebacker Alex Gedeon, who will start at punter in the place of sophomore Jake Dombrowski.
“With two really strong defenses, we expect that the punting team will get on the field for both teams,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “It’s huge. So, we’ll see how it goes in the early going, but it’s going to be a field-position game. It’s going to be, among other things, the team that makes the least mistakes, and the team that plays the best field position football [that will win].”
A year ago in Cambridge, Penn defeated Harvard, 17-7, to take the 2009 Ivy League title, a fact that is not lost on the Crimson.
“Coach’s mood is a little bit different this week,” Hanson said. “The press has been talking about how great Penn’s defense is and how great Penn’s offense is, so he’s trying to piss us off a little bit. He reminds us about what happened last year, and we definitely don’t want that to happen again.”
Historically, Harvard has not fared well at Franklin Field. The Crimson is 2-12 at Penn since 1982 but defeated the Quakers on their home turf in 2008.
Harvard must overcome its Philadelphia blues in order to maintain its shot at capturing another Ivy League title.
“It doesn’t change our game plan or how we prepare at all,” said Hanson of playing on the road. “We like playing there; it’s a nice stadium. If there’s a hostile crowd, we look forward to it. It’s always a good atmosphere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a busy day for the Harvard women’s soccer team.
Less than 12 hours after Crimson co-captain Katherine Sheeleigh was announced as the 2010 Ivy League Player of the Year, Harvard (9-7-1, 4-3 Ivy) traveled to Fairfield, Conn., to conclude its season in a non-conference matchup with Fairfield (8-9-3, 4-3-2 MAAC) last night at Lessing Field.
And when the Crimson arrived, the good times kept rolling.
Harvard closed out its season with a 3-1 victory, its fourth win in its last five contests.
“It was one of the best days that I’ve had in a while,” Sheeleigh said. “To go out with the win was just so fun. It was really special.”
The Crimson, which entered halftime tied, 1-1, with the Stags, relied on a second-half surge led by junior Melanie Baskind’s two goals to pull out the win.
“I think it was a lot of energy [that accounted for the strong second half],” Harvard coach Ray Leone said. “We really truly played like it was the last 45 minutes of the season.”
In the match’s opening minutes, it didn’t look like Harvard would need a late rally to pull out the win.
The visitors got on the board early, jumping out to a 1-0 lead just eight minutes into the contest, thanks to a score from freshman Elizabeth Weisman. The forward notched her first career goal, taking a pass from Sheeleigh in front of the cage and then booting the ball over the head of Fairfield goalie Kelly Boudreau.
Sheeleigh—who became the sixth player in Harvard history to take home the honor of the conference’s top player—was credited with her team-leading seventh assist on the year.
But the home team fought its way back into the contest.
Just 13 minutes later, the Stags called on their own freshman to even the score. Midfielder Nikko Stanton tallied her first career goal, heading a ball past Crimson freshman goalkeeper Jessica Wright in the 21st minute.
Fairfield kept the pressure up for the remainer of the half, outshooting Harvard, 2-0, heading into the break.
But after being held without a shot over the final 37:44 of the first half, the Crimson came out on a tear to start the second, registering three shot attempts and two shots on goal in the first six minutes.
“[In the second half] I think we really committed to win the game,” Sheeleigh said. “We just knew there was no way we we’re going to lose this game.”
While none of its first shot attempts found their mark, Harvard was not denied for much longer. In the 65th minute, junior Melanie Baskind broke the deadlock, putting the Crimson ahead 2-1.
Baskind—who was named to the All-Ivy First Team yesterday afternoon—recovered a loose ball inside the box and kicked it to the far post for her eighth score of the year.
Harvard kept the pressure up offensively, following Baskind’s goal with shot attempts from sophomore Alexandra Conigliaro and senior Katie Kuzma, who is also a Crimson sports editor.
But the Stags denied the Crimson attempts and countered with shots of their own. With 14:01 to play, Fairfield’s Shannon Fay—the Stags’ leading goal scorer—found an opening and fired a shot at goal.
But Harvard sophomore goalkeeper AJ Millet—who entered the contest midway through the first period—was there to make the stop. Millet finished with two saves and zero goals allowed, making it more than 180 minutes of play since the keeper last allowed a goal.
“We’re really proud that [Millet] was able to improve throughout the season and have a great finish,” Leone said.
Baskind put the game out of reach in the 90th minute, scoring on an empty net with 17 seconds left to play after the Stags pulled their keeper.
While the goal may not have changed the outcome of the game, the tally marked Baskind’s ninth of the season, tying her with Sheeleigh as the Ivy League’s leading scorer.
“[Baskind and Sheeleigh] are such a great combination,” Leone said. “They played off each other so well [throughout the season]. They are always looking for each other first. It was poetic the way they finished.”
“I absolutely love playing with her,” Sheeleigh added. “We couldn’t have gone out a better way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s the last week before Harvard-Yale, and plenty of teams are taking on Ivy competition in conference matches to prepare for the big event.
The football team hits the road again this week against Penn tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. in its sixth conference matchup. Last week, Harvard extended its win streak to three, defeating Columbia, 23-7. Chances are good that the Crimson can continue its winning ways. The squad holds a 45-33-2 record over the Quakers and has won four of the past six meetings.
The men’s soccer team also travels to the City of Brotherly Love to finish its season tomorrow. It’s been a rough year for the men—falling from last season’s 14-4-1 record to 4-7-5—but the squad looks to cap off the season on a positive note. The Crimson holds a slight advantage over Penn going into the matchup. Harvard has won two of the last three games, including a 1-0 victory at home last season.
The women’s volleyball team stays home to wrap up its regular season against Penn and Princeton tonight at 7 p.m. and tomorrow evening at 5 p.m. at the MAC. The women have also seen a drop in performance compared to last year, going from 12-13 to 8-16. The Quakers come into the matchup fresh off two victories against Columbia and Cornell, and the Tigers have a 13-9 record arriving in Cambridge. Earlier in the season, the Crimson dropped both of its matches to Penn and Princeton.
The men’s and women’s basketball teams both kick off their years tomorrow. After a successful 21-8 record last season, the men head down to George Mason to kick off another campaign at 4 p.m. The two squads have never met on the court before. Meanwhile, the women head up to Maine for their season opener at noon. Almost identical to the men’s record, the squad crushed the competition last year, going 20-9. The Crimson is behind 4-6 in the overall series, but has earned victories in the last three games against Maine.
The men’s and women’s ice hockey teams also recently started their seasons and continue on the road this weekend. The men’s squad split its opening matches at home last weekend, with a 2-1 loss to Union and a 1-0 victory over Rensselaer. The men take on St. Lawrence tonight at 7 p.m. and Clarkson tomorrow night at the same time. The women, currently 2-1-1, travel to Quinnipiac and Princeton tonight and tomorrow afternoon, after splitting its first road games last weekend.
Finally, there are some big tournaments happening this weekend for the Crimson. The cross country team heads to Connecticut for the NCAA Regionals tomorrow afternoon. The women’s fencing squad starts off the year by competing at the Penn State Open. The wrestling team also kicks off hits the mat at the Binghamton Open on Sunday. And last but not least, the women’s lightweight and heavyweight crew squads take on competition at the annual Foot of the Charles.

The world’s most powerful person is no longer a Harvard graduate, according to Forbes’ newly released list of the world’s most powerful people. The list, which is in only its second year, claims that Chinese President Hu Jintao has overtaken President Barack Obama HLS ’91 to become the world’s most powerful person.
Despite the loss of the top spot, Harvard still fares well on the list. In fact, Harvard is better represented than any other school (only one Yalie made the cut). The article, which lists 68 influential individuals from around the world, features 12 people who attended Harvard at one time or another.
Three of Harvard’s representatives on the list—Obama, Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke ’75, and Microsoft Founder Bill Gates—made the top ten, placing second, eighth, and 10th respectively. Other recognizable Harvard names include Facebook founder Mark E. Zuckerburg, New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg HBS ’66, and  General Electric CEO Jeffrey R. Immelt HBS ’82.
While the list’s editors consider a number of factors to determine who made the cut, the magazine ultimately chose people who “bend the world to their will.”

FAS IT sent out an email and text message early Thursday morning warning Mac users not to download the Mac OS X 10.6.5 update, which was released Wednesday. The new software update may face compatibility issues that may prevent Mac from restarting.
The text message read: "To all MAC users. From FAS-IT. Please DO NOT install the MAC OS X 10.6.5 Update released today by Apple. Our encryption software vendor, PGP, has reported a compatibility issue which may prevent your laptop from restarting."
Apparently, the compatibility issue occurs only on computers that use PGP Whole Disk Encryption, software designed to protect personal and sensitive information. Because of this, FAS IT has blocked access to the Apple software update site on the FAS network. For users of the encryption software, the company has recommendations for updating Mac OS X in addition to support for those experiencing compatibility problems.
The source of the problem has yet to be identified. However, both FAS IT and PGP are looking to find the source and a solution to the problem. In the meantime, it is probably best to stay on the safe side and hold off on downloading OS X 10.6.5, even if you do not use PGP.
In related news, Mac users have been having trouble accessing the e-resources on HOLLIS. These include problems with searches, viewing full text and personal accounts, according to the Office for Information Systems (OIS). Recommendations for how Mac users who are experiencing issues can deal with the computer problems were released yesterday and can be found here.

In this series, we chat with the freshmen who were lucky enough to land dorm rooms that once housed Harvard’s most famous almuni.
Today, we bring you to the room in Hollis where Sandesh K. Kataria '14 and Collin S. VanOstran '14 currently reside. This expansive double once housed Henry David Thoreau in the year 1833. With a poster of “Flight of the Concords” on the wall, the decoration of the room has certainly changed since Thoreau’s time.
Here are some excerpts from our conversation:
Henry David Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, which reflects upon simple living. Have you ever been to Walden Pond? If not, what is your favorite body of water?
Kataria: Nope. I guess the Charles River. Actually, I think I like the Hudson more.
VanOstran: The Mississippi River. [Are you from Mississippi?] No, I’m from Missouri. I just really like the Mississippi River.
Thoreau was also political. He once said, “That government is best which governs not at all.” What is the first thing you would do if the government were absolved?
Kataria: Grand Theft Auto in real life. 
The father of Thoreau was a pencil maker. If you could make any one thing sold at Staples, what would it be?
VanOstran: I think I’d like making the chairs – like the nice, comfy leather office chairs.
Kataria: So I think they’re doing a really good job with the Easy Button…
Thoreau once said, “I stand in awe of my body.” What is your best physical trait?
Kataria: My hair, I guess. When it’s looking good.
VanOstran: I like my blue eyes. They’re pretty stunning. They stare right into people’s souls.
Thoreau lived in Hollis throughout his four years as a student. If you weren’t forced to move into a House, would you stay there forever?
Kataria: Actually, maybe. Well, only if they made the room with a built-in bathroom, then I wouldn’t mind.
VanOstran: It’s close to everything – I love this room!

The fashion designs of several professional Asian and Asian American designers, along with the styles of nine recent graduates of the Parsons New School of Design, will debut tomorrow in the Project East 2010 runway show.
The event, which is produced by Kelsey A. Maguire '11 and Michael R. Polino '11, will feature a DJ, a silent auction, and an after party. Project East—which is now in its fourth year—differs from other runway shows on campus because of its focus on the actual designs, according to Maguire.
"This is all about the clothes—it’s all about the designers and their interesting, sort of strange pieces," said Maguire, who was an assistant producer for last year’s show.
In the first half of the show, Harvard students will model four to eight designs from each Parsons graduate. Following a brief intermission, they will sport the fashions of the professional designers, including Derek Lam, Angela Chen, Uma Wang, Nio, and Angelo Gao.
"One thing we’re always excited about changing is the new clothes," said Polino, who has also been deejaying the show each year since he was a freshman. "The thesis students at Parsons are coming up with such cool designs," he said. "It’s interesting to see that and compare to what is on the professional scene right now. Each year, we’re building momentum and getting more designers on board."
Unlike in previous years, the proceeds of the silent auction and ticket sales will no longer go to charity, but the goal of the show is still to promote Asian and Asian American designs.
"In the four years since Project East has been founded, there has been increased exposure for the Asian American design community," Maguire said. "Visibility has really increased nationally for Asian and Asian American fashion designers…so it’s a really interesting position for us to be in."
The show starts tomorrow, Nov. 13, at 7:30 p.m. in the Northwest Laboratories. Regular tickets cost $10 and VIP tickets cost $20. The space will allow more than 600 people to attend.
