After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Several hundred students have spent the last few days urging Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf to resign because he did something that was, well, entirely within his purview — Elmendorf vetoed the appointment of Kenneth Roth as a fellow at the school’s Carr Center of Human Rights, and Roth subsequently claimed the veto was due to his “criticism of Israel.”
Roth, the so-called “godfather” of human rights and former executive director of the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, spearheaded the transformation of HRW into an organization that has helped “turn Israel into a pariah state,” according to its founder Robert L. Bernstein ’44, who has since condemned the organization’s shift.
I find it amusing that the signatories in this letter think they are entitled to demand his resignation. Not everyone is entitled to a fellowship purely in the name of free speech, and Dean Elmendorf has the procedural right to not select someone.
While it is true that Dean Elmendorf’s reasoning is likely linked to Roth’s stances on Israel, this decision is not an attempt by the dean to block all anti-Israel perspectives.
How do I know this? Well, the proof is in the pudding. The reality is that the Kennedy School and Harvard University writ large already feature an array of anti-Israel voices at the faculty, fellow, and student levels, who have been provided with ample support from HKS and the University: Fellows have included former Palestinian Liberation Organization spokesperson Diana Buttu, while HKS hosted a controversial 2012 “One State Solution” conference that was partially sponsored by the Weatherhead Center and the Office of the Provost, to name only a few examples.
Dean Elmendorf never seems to have banned any of these people from discussing their views on Israel, nor has he ever publicly taken an explicitly pro-Israel stance, nor, as far as I can recall, has anyone else in the current Harvard administration, and so it would be hard to claim Dean Elmendorf is just a mouthpiece for the pro-Israel camp.
What is also laughable is that the cohort advocating for Dean Elmendorf’s resignation on the grounds that his decision goes against “principles underpinning free thought in a free society” is part of the same group of organizations that has continually protested about the presence of pro-Israel speakers on campus.
Many of the most vociferous among those who authored and signed this letter — particularly the Palestine Solidarity Committee and the HKS Palestine Caucus — are the same people who have supported the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, which calls for Harvard to divest from any investments in Israeli companies, and who have called on students to boycott Israel Trek, a privately sponsored trip to Israel exploring the conflict from multiple perspectives.
The PSC, for instance, refused to have a conversation with one of Israel Trek’s student leaders to preserve “the comfort level and safety of the Palestinian students” since the fact that some of the trip’s organizers were former Israeli Defense Forces soldiers created a “power imbalance.” But since Israel has a draft, nearly every Israeli student has served in the IDF.
A similar letter from the ​​HKS Palestinian Alumni Collective calling on Dean Elmendorf to resign also says the school should not invite any speakers or fellows who “bear responsibility for war crimes perpetrated against Palestinians, including the crime of apartheid, a crime against humanity” — a phrase that, given the IDF draft, could be taken to imply that almost all Israeli citizens are guilty of war crimes, which would suggest that no dialogue should be had with any Israeli fellow or student.
Pro-Israel voices, on the other hand, do not seem to be particularly welcome, through efforts like the push to boycott Israel Trek. Last spring, Amos Yadlin’s study group was met with consistent protests and a call from the PSC for students to “deplatform Yadlin’s troubling presence,” while Israeli ambassador Michael Herzog’s visit to the school was interrupted and overrun with student protesters. At every turn, it seems as if pro-Israel voices are not permitted to speak.
You don’t see the organizations who called on Dean Elmendorf to resign advocating on behalf of free speech on these occasions, and so one can only conclude that their invocation of the principle in their letter is disingenuous — it seems, instead, to be anger that anti-Israel voices are not welcomed with open arms at every juncture.
Even if Roth’s rejection is in part related to his views on Israel, it is not a violation of free speech for Dean Elmendorf to decide that a fellow who will just regurgitate already-existing notions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is extraneous. That so many students and student organizations have signed this letter is proof that Harvard students do not need another fellow reinforcing their views rather than encouraging discourse and debate.
I hope Dean Elmendorf can use his platform going forward to bring in a fellow who can challenge the campus’s distorted conception of this conflict — say, a fellow discussing Israel’s role as the only democracy in the Middle East, with Arab and Muslim minority representation in its government, and by far the country in the region most accepting of the LGBTQ+ community. I would challenge every signatory on this letter to attend this fellow’s study group in support of, as they put it, “academic freedom.”
Our campus discourse about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be nuanced and informative. Whining about not being able to add yet another voice to the anti-Israel echo chamber will not achieve that goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Corporation member and a former Harvard provost will help investigate Stanford’s president for potential academic misconduct in journal articles he co-authored, a Stanford special committee announced last week.
Steven E. Hyman, who served for a decade as Harvard’s provost from 2001 to 2011, and Shirley M. Tilghman, a former Princeton president who now serves on Harvard's highest governing body, the Harvard Corporation, will serve on a five-person scientific panel investigating Stanford President Marc T. Tessier-Lavigne.
Tessier-Lavigne has been an author on at least four neuroscience papers that allegedly contain manipulated images. The Stanford Daily first reported allegations of academic misconduct against Tessier-Lavigne in November 2022.
Stanford claims Tessier-Lavigne was informed of the allegations in 2015 and attempted to correct them, and that the images have no bearing on the papers’ findings. Experts — and the journal Science, which published one of the papers — disagree, the Daily reported.
Hours after the Daily published its report, the Stanford Board of Trustees announced that a special committee would investigate the allegations. In December, the special committee said that Mark R. Filip, a former federal judge and former U.S. deputy attorney general who now works with the law firm Kirkland & Ellis, would lead the investigation.
Last week, Carol C. Lam, a Stanford trustee and the special committee’s chairperson, announced that Filip, a Harvard Law School alum, had convened a scientific panel to assist him. Some of the nation’s top neuroscientists and biologists, including Hyman and Tilghman, will serve on the five-person body.
A spokesperson for the special committee wrote in an emailed statement that panel members were selected for their research integrity expertise, academic publishing experience, and reputation among scientists.
Though scientists at the panel’s level of experience are likely familiar with Tessier-Lavigne and his work, Filip and the committee are confident that the panelists will maintain impartiality, the spokesperson added.
A Stanford trustee, Felix J. Baker, previously stepped down from the special committee after the Daily reported that he had a financial stake in Tessier-Lavigne’s biotech company.
Hyman, a professor of stem cell and regenerative biology, led the National Institute of Mental Health from 1996 to 2001 and served as Harvard’s provost between 2001 and 2011. As provost, Hyman developed numerous interfaculty initiatives and helped create the Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology.
During Hyman’s tenure as provost, several Harvard professors faced challenges to the academic integrity of their work. Most notably, former psychology professor Marc D. Hauser resigned in 2011 after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences found him responsible for academic misconduct in three published articles.
Other allegations of academic misconduct during Hyman’s tenure included charges of plagiarism against former Harvard School of Public Health assistant professor Ali A. Sultan in 2004 and former Harvard Medical School professor Lee S. Simon in 2009, both of whom resigned following the allegations. During Hyman's tenure, former HMS professor and Nobel laureate Linda B. Buck also retracted three academic papers, including one featuring research conducted at Harvard.
Tilghman, who was president of Princeton from 2001 to 2013, is a renowned molecular biologist who chaired the committee that reviewed Harvard’s life sciences program and also served on a committee that advised then-Dean of Radcliffe College Drew G. Faust as it became the Radcliffe Institute of Advanced Study. Tilghman was elected to the Harvard Corporation in 2015.
The panel’s scientific evaluation is ongoing, the release from the special committee said. There is no specific deadline for the completion of their work, according to a committee spokesperson.
Along with Hyman and Tilghman, the panel also includes Scripps College neuroscience professor Hollis T. Cline, Duke psychiatry and neurobiology professor Kafui Dzirasa, and University of California, Berkeley professor Randy W. Schekman — the recipient of a 2013 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.
Hyman and Tilghman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 20, 2023, at 2:04 a.m.
In a reversal, Harvard Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced Thursday morning that he would name human rights advocate Kenneth Roth to a fellowship after previously vetoing his appointment.
Elmendorf’s email, sent to HKS affiliates, explained that the original decision to block Roth’s appointment was based on the “evaluation of his potential contributions to the School” and not influenced by donors.
Earlier this month, The Nation reported allegations that Elmendorf vetoed Roth’s appointment to a fellowship at HKS’ Carr Center for Human Rights Policy due to his criticism of Israel. The decision has since drawn widespread backlash from students and faculty, including calls for the dean to resign.
“I now believe that I made an error in my decision not to appoint him as a Fellow at our Carr Center for Human Rights,” Elmendorf wrote on Thursday. “I am sorry that the decision inadvertently cast doubt on the mission of the School and our commitment to open debate in ways I had not intended and do not believe to be true.”
In the email, Elmendorf also announced his plan to create a faculty committee devoted to evaluatingI fellowship appointments to “draw more on the insights of the Kennedy School faculty as a whole.”
Elmendorf wrote that he reversed his decision after discussions with faculty members.
“I hope that our community will be able to benefit from his deep experience in a wide range of human rights issues,” he wrote.
HKS faculty voiced support for offering a fellowship to Roth during a faculty meeting Tuesday afternoon. Mathias Risse, the director of the Carr Center, wrote in an email that HKS faculty “pretty much unanimously” support offering Roth a fellowship.
“From where I stand, it is because of this faculty input that the dean changed his mind, to the point of acknowledging that he had made an error earlier,” he wrote. “I was responsible for proposing him as a fellow in the first place, and so obviously I am very happy about this turn of events.”
After the faculty meeting, Risse offered Roth the fellowship, which he accepted.
In a tweet, Roth wrote he is “thrilled” by Elmendorf’s decision to reverse course on blocking his fellowship but called on Elmendorf to offer more transparency regarding the original decision to veto.
“He still has not said anything about the people ‘who matter to him,’” he wrote, referring to faculty members’ accounts that suggest Elmendorf’s decision was linked to others at the University. “Full transparency is key to ensuring that such influence is not exerted in other cases.”
Roth added he remains “worried about academic freedom” for less prominent figures who have criticized Israel.
“The problem of people penalized for criticizing Israel is not limited to me, and most scholars and students have no comparable capacity to mobilize public attention,” he wrote. “How is the Kennedy School, and Harvard, going to ensure that this episode conveys a renewed commitment to academic freedom rather than just exceptional treatment for one well known individual?”
Harvard spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on Elmendorf’s reversal or concerns regarding academic freedom.
The Harvard College Palestine Solidarity Committee criticized Elmendorf’s email for “doing little to ensure full academic freedom and protection for Palestinian students and scholars at Harvard,” in a statement on Instagram released Thursday afternoon.
“Elmendorf’s statement suggests that the spurious attack on Roth’s reputation will likely not be the last time Harvard attempts to silence legitimate criticism of Israel,” the statement reads. “Roth’s presence on campus will be of great value to Harvard Kennedy School students and broader human rights discourse, but Harvard’s administration must also do more to actively center Palestinian voices and perspectives.”
Following Elmendorf’s decision to block Roth from the fellowship, hundreds of Harvard affiliates demanded his resignation. The HKS Palestinian Alumni Collective, the first Harvard-affiliated group to advocate for Elmendorf’s resignation after Roth's fellowship denial, reiterated calls for the dean to step down in a statement Thursday.
HKSPAC co-convener Ahmed A. Moor said Elmendorf’s original decision revealed that his values “don’t align with those of the institution.”
“The crisis of faith still exists, the crisis of leadership still exists,” Moor said.
Moor called Elmendorf’s plans for a faculty committee to evaluate potential fellows a “good move in the right direction,” but echoed calls for greater transparency over Elmendorf’s original decision.
“We need transparency on how decisions are made. We need transparency on who’s got input into the decision,” Moor said. “This isn’t a campaign. It’s not a corporate environment where shareholder prerogatives reign. It’s an academic institution — a different set of principles apply.”
