Currier House Resident Dean Katherine Stanton will become assistant dean in the Office of Undergraduate Education on Oct. 1, replacing Logan S. McCarty, who assumed a new position as director of Physical Sciences Education on July 1.
In her new position Stanton will be responsible for assigning teaching fellows and teaching assistants to undergraduate courses and divvying up the funds set aside for TF and TA salaries.
“[Stanton] will bring to the OUE a thorough understanding of the College's structure and its policies, as well as an understanding of the important partnership between the College and the Graduate School in supporting undergraduate courses and developing strong teaching staff,” wrote Harris and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds in an e-mail announcing the administrative changes.
Stanton, who will continue to live in Currier House next year as a resident scholar, previously taught at Rutgers and Swarthmore and served as assistant director of the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning at Princeton.
“Even though we are sad to lose Kate we are delighted for her that all her wonderful skills have been so deservedly recognized, and we wish her the very best in her new position,” wrote Currier House Administrator Patricia G. Pepper in an e-mail to House residents.
McCarty—who served as assistant dean of the OUE for almost three years—left the OUE to become the director of Physical Sciences Education in the Division of Science, a role he says better matches his academic and administrative interests.
“After looking at what I had been doing in terms of teaching and my own interests in teaching and developing the undergraduate curriculum, it was clear that it would be better for me and for the College to have me in the role that was more involved with teaching and pedagogy,” said McCarty, who said he first spoke with Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris about the new role a year ago.
Last fall McCarty taught two classes in the College and one in the Extension School, triple the number of courses that administrators in his role have traditionally taught. He said he looks forward to the chance to work more closely with students and instructors in his new position, in which he will help develop curricula, evaluate courses, and coordinate advising within the physical sciences.
“The actual education of undergraduates takes place in our classrooms and labs, and that actually happens under purview of departments,” McCarty said. “So in moving into the Science Division and into the Science Center, I’ll be moving closer to the actual teaching and learning that’s taking place.”
Stanton, who is currently on maternity leave, will fill McCarty’s seat after her return.
