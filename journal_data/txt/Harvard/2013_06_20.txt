After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRAGUE, Czech Republic—Living right off Prague’s Old Town Square may not provide the best window into authentic Czech culture, but it does give one the opportunity to acquaint oneself well with the assortment of street performers that frequent those oft-travelled cobblestones. Their ranks include mimes, musicians, and bubble-makers, the likes of which seem to appear at tourist destinations the world over, but there is one busker whose presence, at least to a 21st century American, is a little shocking. He’s a slightly pudgy Caucasian man who wears a dumpy tan costume accented with blue, red, and black feathers, with simple feather headdress to match; it’s nothing more than a cheap Native American Halloween costume. He holds a small drum in one hand, beats it with the other. He runs in circles to its rhythm all the while emitting the inarticulate sounds of a cruel caricature. With an infantile grin he occasionally customizes his tune to that of drunken tourists singing drinking songs at night in the surrounding cafes.
At least the didgeridoo player’s didgeridoo looks authentic, and the mimes in period dress seem to have gone to some lengths over the trimmings of their costume. The Indian (I call him this for he cannot be a Native American in any real sense of the name), in his crude get-up and total lack of musical authenticity is terribly out of place. If he weren’t so pathetic he would certainly by quite offensive. I could only imagine how disgusting his silly act would appear to someone of actual Native American heritage.
There are so many amazing things about this city and about the few Czech people that I’ve met here that I’ve been inclined to write him off as just a poor idiot, maybe a drunkard, not representative culturally of anything. Who knows where he picked up this particular brand of stupidity. His continued presence, for however long he’s been around, could not be but the result of sympathy and an understandable degree of distance here from the realities of his ridicule.  But the other day, when I was eating lunch with a Czech friend, she mentioned that some children here go to what she called “Indian Summer Camps.” There, children live in teepees and follow instructions of a ‘Chief,’ a Czech man merely assuming the title, though at least in her experience without any accompanying silly outfit. It didn’t sound too far from the things I had experienced at summer camp when I was younger, such as crafts and activities inspired by and rather modified from Native American traditions. Not that far thematically, that is, but quite far geographically!
I looked into the camps a little online, and found that the Czechs are indeed particularly fascinated with Native American culture, as a result of Wild West adventure stories from the late 19th century written by Karl May, a German author who had never visited America at the time he was writing. A woman who visited one of the so-called Indian Summer Camps, expresses pleasant surprise at the authenticity of Native American traditions practiced there (except, of course, for the problematic practice of painting their entire faces red).
Whether Native Americans would be pleased at the surprising breadth of their cultural influence, or dismayed at the twisting of their traditions, I cannot presume to know. At worst, it can be no worse than the treatment of Native American cultures in the United States, and we cannot say we do not still badly caricature other cultures at times. Though I cannot speak to the accuracy of their practices, perhaps, like my American summer camps, the Czech camps really are looking to Native Americans respectfully for inspiration rather than as a gimmick. The Indian in Old Town Square, on the other hand, is all gimmick. I haven’t seen him there in a couple of days, though, so let’s hope he’s moved on or found a better shtick for getting money from tourists.

NEW YORK—Some of life’s tests you can’t study for: certain computer science exams at Harvard, hearing tests, tests of character. If I had something profound or insightful to add to this list, I would. But all my summer has given me so far is this: also, drug tests.
The package, mailed from the corporate headquarters of the company I’d be interning for, arrived at 11 a.m. on the Saturday prior to my Monday start date. At first, I was annoyed that my mother had woken me up (on the grounds that there exist implicit “do not resuscitate” orders for kids who’ve just returned from college). But then I was grateful: the paperwork enclosed in the package said I had to complete the drug test within 48 hours.
The weekend hours of  “Quest Diagnostics,” my designated testing center: Saturday, 10-12:30. Sunday, Closed. It was already 11:30. I had an hour. I grabbed a water bottle and was off.
I added my name to the unnervingly long sign-in list and greeted the unhappy-looking receptionist. It isn’t easy to be a receptionist at a “Quest Diagnostics” in Queens, NY.  Sure, it’s not the hardest job in the world—that’s what those Alaskan king crab fishermen on “Deadliest Catch” do. But “Quest Diagnostics’ receptionist” in Queens is up there.
It’s not so much the daily interaction with parolees and little snot-makers carrying who-knows-what kinds of communicable diseases that makes it hard.
It’s having to pronounce the names.
New York City’s largest borough is also the most ethnically diverse place on earth. This makes for an excellent variety of cuisines, from “Mama’s Empanadas” to “Knish Nosh” to the less clever but no less descriptive “Himalayan Yak Restaurant.” It also makes it fun to ride the subway and smile/frown/raise your eyebrows as you pretend to understand whatever language the old men across from you are speaking.
But Queens’s diversity also makes for a complicated variety of spellings and pronunciations. The receptionist seemed apprehensive every time she looked down at the sign-in sheet, full of alien consonant combinations and intimidating lengths. At 12:15 she tried mine: “Moglinski?” Close enough. I rose to hand in my paperwork, channeling Michael Parzen as I thought: “Let’s get this over with.”
“You’ll have four minutes to fill the cup to the line,” said the nurse who administered my test. He handed me a small key and told me to put my belongings in the metal lockbox on the counter.
“Are you ready to go?” It seemed a little soon to be talking about such intimate bodily functions, but I told him yes.
That turned out to be the wrong answer. I couldn’t produce a large enough sample. “Of course, contraction of the involuntary sphincter is part of the autonomic nervous system’s response to stress,” my neuro-anatomist mother would later say. Yes—of course. At the time, though, all I could think was “Oh my god, oh my god, I’m going to fail.”
I made myself decent and opened the bathroom door to ask the nurse if the pathetic volume would be enough.
He laughed. “THAT? Nope.”
“Oh my god, I’m going to fail, aren’t I?”
“Well, you have one minute left, try to go!”
I tried. I couldn’t. I was struggling to recall the details of the commencement speech J.K. Rowling gave in 2008, the one about how failure is good for you, when the nurse knocked to signal that the four minutes were up.
I had one more chance, he said, but I’d have to start over. “And technically we’re already closed, so you’d better be fast.”
And then I drank more water than I ever have in my life. Having locked my water bottle in the metal box, I had to stand next to the cooler and keep refilling a four-ounce paper cup. I don’t know how much I drank, but my stomach already felt fit to burst when I noticed that a kid next to me seemed to be having a similar problem. “Keep going,” his dad insisted. “Don’t be a wimp.” At least I’m not a wimp, I told myself. Then again, that kid probably wasn’t at risk of failing a drug test.
Feeling painfully bloated and a little ashamed, I considered what my own father would have told me had he been there. “I think you should keep drinking,” he’d have said, even though he’d have really meant, “I don’t believe in weakness.” I sighed and refilled the sad little paper cup.
“Mojaluski?” said the receptionist. It was 1 p.m. Do or die. Urinary bladder, don’t fail me now, I thought as I hobbled to the bathroom.
Then I did it. I filled the cup to the line. I high-fived the nurse (after he’d poured the sample into a plastic test tube) and left “Quest” feeling victorious. I only made it about a third of the way home before remembering that I’d left my wallet, phone, and keys in the aluminum lock-box.
I will spare you the details, but I could not venture far from the bathroom for the rest of the day.  Hours later, as I lay on the couch feeling lightheaded and uncomfortable, my dad said, “That’ll teach you not to drink so heavily.”

MEDELLIN, Colombia—“Un tinto Americano, por favor.”
I was chatting with the barista at the coffee shop outside my office in Medellin, Colombia as I watched him make my coffee—about his plans for college, the tattoo on his knuckle, about the peculiar version of paisa Spanish spoken in the city. My friends waited outside as the sun, a constant presence in the “city of eternal spring,” beat down on the people walking on the sidewalk. Cars honked as traffic snarled.
At first, I didn’t notice the growing cacophony of shouts, as the voices blended in with the ambient noise of the street. Suddenly, what sounded like an explosion pierced through our conversation, forcing me to look up from my coffee. Two of my friends shouted:  “Run! Run, Michael!”
What?
“Run!” I looked up and saw it, a foreboding cloud rolling down the street, grey tentacles stretching towards me.  Soon, I felt it—my eyes stung as tears suddenly flowed down my checks. I froze for a moment and saw shrouded hooded figures emerging from within the cloud, trying to outrun its advance, before my smarting eyes forced me to join the fleeing crowd.
We ran back into our office and wondered what had just happened as the dull boom, boom of explosions continued, close to us—where had the tear gas come from? With memories of the Boston Marathon fresh in my mind, I was struck by the calm of everyone around me: the man with dreadlocks across from me was nodding his head to his Beats; the person beside him calmly typed away at her laptop.
I eventually wandered over to the office next door and asked some Colombians what was going on. Amused by my concern, a young man looked up and said, casually, that I shouldn’t worry.
“They’re just setting off small bombs.”
It was only once I got home that I was able to find a news report describing what had happened: students known as encapuchados (“hooded ones”) had staged riots at the University of Antioquia across the street, forcing the evacuation of the school. They broke into the laboratories of Biology professors, threatened those present, and then turned their offices into a “war room,” to make home-made bombs known as papas bomba (“potato bombs”).  The rioting, and the large numbers of undetonated explosive devices with shrapnel necessitated the intervention of the National Police’s Anti-Riot Special Operations Forces and its Bomb Squad.  News reports linked the protests to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerilla group that has been in armed conflict with the government for 50 years.
My Colombian roommates later laughed when I told them I had been scared, explaining that such protests with papas bomba were common at public universities throughout Colombia. “The University of Antioquia has some of the best engineers in the country,” she said, “so they just use the chemicals they can get in their labs.” This cool, nonchalant non-response struck me as absurd when I tried to imagine a similar situation in the United States—Harvard students breaking into labs, preparing explosives, and lobbing them at the police.
“They’re just setting off small bombs.”
Medellin is a city transformed. Twenty years ago, the “city of eternal spring” was the most violent in the world, with daily bombings and a terrifying murder rate of 381 per 100,000 people in 1991—if New York City had the same murder rate Medellin once had, 32,000 people would have died in 2012 rather than 414. Although Medellin’s current murder rate of 60 per 100,000 still dwarf’s New York City’s 3.8, the former headquarters of cartel leader Pablo Escobar has left its violent image far in the past: a shining new metro system has integrated the poor hill-side comunas into the city, and the government is building new schools, libraries, and parks in areas formerly paralyzed by chaos.
But how does a city with a history of violence, murder, and terrorism cope with violence in the future? What struck me is how the normalization of violence can change our reactions to shrapnel-filled bombs, explosions, tear gas, and sirens.
What happens when bombings become boring?
Times are changing in Medellin—the Association of University Professors released a statement declaring that the school could not be turned into a “battlefield.” “We expect expeditious and decisive measures,” they said, “beyond the usual routine announcements that are exasperating and useless.” The day after the riot, professors from the University’s Institute of Biology launched an indefinite strike in protest.
That day, I tried to focus as much as I could on my work, even though the Top 40 I was listening to was surreally interrupted by the deep roar of explosions every few minutes, followed soon after by the shrill wail of police sirens.
After one particularly loud explosion, a fellow intern and I could only look at each other and laugh at the absurdity.
“We have become used to these acts of vandalism being forgotten the next day,” the Vice Rector of the University would later note. “It cannot go on like this."

A Morgan Stanley executive will take over as Harvard Management Company’s next chief risk officer, the body announced Wednesday.
 
Jake Xia, who has managed trading groups in New York, London, Tokyo, and other cities around the world, has held various positions related to risk management and trading during his 17 years at Morgan Stanley. In his new position at HMC, which manages Harvard’s $30 billion endowment, Xia will head the group that monitors investment risks of HMC’s internal and external portfolios.
 
“Jake’s extensive experience in risk management and complex trading across many asset classes and international geographies will be central to HMC’s continued success in balancing return and risk in our complex and globally diverse portfolio,” HMC President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo said in a press release Wednesday.
 
At Morgan Stanley, Xia most recently served as head of global structured rates trading in New York. He had previously been the head of global fixed income trading risk, also in New York, and co-head of fixed income in Japan.
 
Though he has worked around the world, this will not be the first undertaking in Boston for Xia, who holds a doctorate from MIT and a master’s degree from Northeastern University.
 
Xia’s arrival at HMC coincides with a period of recovery for Harvard’s endowment, which, while remaining by far the largest of any University in the world, dropped around $11 billion following the financial crisis. Though HMC has since regained about half of that loss, the endowment dipped slightly in the 2012 fiscal year, which ended on June 30 of last year.
 
Xia will succeed Neil Mason, who assumed the position in March 2010 and is leaving on July 1 due to family reasons.

CORRECTION: June 20, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that HMC’s chief risk officer position was newly created when Neil Mason joined the company in 2010. In fact, the position had existed prior to that point.

EdX has hit the one-million students mark—meaning it’s one-thousandth of the way to its goal of educating one billion people.
 
The online learning venture, which was launched by Harvard and MIT in May 2012, announced the benchmark with a tweet Wednesday along with this photo of some of its staff beaming and celebrating at edX’s Cambridge office. The platform’s one millionth student joined on Tuesday, the tweet said.
EdX is “thrilled to have reached this important milestone,” said Syvenna Siebert, a spokesperson who spoke on behalf of edX.
 
The platform’s meteoric rise in enrollment has been accompanied by rapid growth in its number of member institutions. When the first edX classes went live in October, there were only seven courses, offered by three universities. Eight months later, edX counts among its members 27 schools and one international governmental organization. And now its thousands of students have turned into a million.
