After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
All members of the Harvard community—particularly those with a close connection to France—will have been deeply shocked by the shooting at the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris two weeks ago, as well as the attack on a kosher supermarket the next day. Across the world, reactions have ranged from sympathy for the victims to horror that such a thing could take place in a country so associated with trailblazing free speech.
Unfortunately, it is the nature of the Harvard community that such feelings will give way in the fullness of time to something else: excuses.
The political leanings of the campus are obvious when it comes to matters of security and confronting religious extremism. Bill Maher called it “liberal bullshit,” and while such a label lacks a certain subtlety, any honest member of the Harvard community will know that Cambridge is one of the great bastions of this pernicious moral failing.
In the aftermath of this attack, we do not know all of the details and motivations that came into play, but the broad strokes are evident. A newspaper famed for taking on religious and political ideas in a provocative—and at times insulting—manner has been targeted by extremists seeking to “avenge the Prophet Mohammad.” The extremists’ method of demanding religious respect was to brutally murder unarmed journalists and cartoonists as they held an editorial meeting. In the secondary attack unarmed civilians were shot for, it seems, the crime of being Jewish. Once again, home-grown jihadists have viciously attacked civilians as part of some warped understanding of the West and Islam being at war with one another.
The West is not at war with Islam.
The problem with Harvard groupthink (and that of the Left more generally on this issue) is that it does not realize that while the West is not at war with an entire religion, we should be at war with its extremist forms.
What this tragic episode should bring about is a renewed commitment from the Left to the idea that it is possible to defend the civil and political rights of Muslims, to fight against discrimination, and to concurrently advocate the strongest possible response to the barbarism represented by this attack and others like it.
The ideology that these murderous Islamist killers acted on is not a product of our foreign policy; it was a response to the publication of cartoons. It is not a reasonable or rational response to sensitivity regarding the depiction of the Prophet, the justification these murderers employed themselves.
There must be absolute moral clarity on this issue: Under no circumstances should there be a death sentence for a journalist insulting or offending someone.
On the Harvard campus, however, it is likely only a few short weeks will go by before panel discussions are advertised in which students will be invited to consider the perspective of these allegedly oppressed criminals. In classes and over coffee, undergrads will pontificate about how insulting the Prophet is the greatest possible insult for a Muslim, as if an insult of any kind could ever reasonably be offered as a rationalization for violence. The traditional apologists for terror such as Glen Greenwald at The Guardian will try and explain this away as if there is no cause for concern and no need for an adjustment in the liberal conscience.
Caught up in the cacophony of faux-experts and contrarians, the Left will slowly lose sight of what happened in Paris, and as a result offer no sensible next steps.
A number of religious fanatics decided to butcher journalists because they disagreed with them. These extremists were few in number, but if one considers the thousands that marched in Paris, Copenhagen, and other cities after the Danish cartoon scandal in 2005, or if one takes a look at a poll of their coreligionists, they have concerning levels of support. Indeed, in Europe where the problem appears most acute (at least in the West), the Muslim Council of Britain felt compelled to urge British Muslims not to react with violence to the release of the latest edition of Charlie Hebdo.
One must not impugn all Muslims as violent or potential terrorists (a proposition that is patently absurd), but one should recognize that there is a significant population that subscribes to the most distasteful and morally repugnant form of Islamism, and that ignoring the problem is not “checking your privilege” but rather signing the death warrant of a free society.
There is so much about terrorism, religious extremism, and the appropriate response to these phenomena that demands careful study. The attack in Paris does not. Now is the time for moral clarity: There is nothing that anyone can write anywhere that should excuse these attacks. Killing people for ideas they write down or draw is an outrage. The same goes for executing grocery shoppers simply because they happen to be Jewish. Anyone who equivocates with regard to this tragic episode is clearly lacking in moral direction.
It is time to call Islamist extremism what it is: religious fascism. Anyone who truly proclaims the values of the Left will side with the West against this extremism, and do so unapologetically.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the over 14,000 words in this year’s readings for Community Conversations, not one was the word “transgender.”
The gay rights movement’s obsessive focus on marriage equality has produced extraordinary progress on that front, but not enough has changed in the experiences of transgender and gender-nonconforming people, said Henri C. Garrison-Desany ’16, Harvard College Queer Advisory Council chair, in an interview.
“I think a lot of trans people are on guard when it comes to disclosing trans status. People just don’t feel comfortable because the world isn’t comfortable with them,” said Garrison-Desany.
Trans teen Leelah Alcorn’s recent suicide is painful evidence of this truth.
Garrison-Desany estimates that transgender and gender-nonconforming students represent two to five percent of the student body, and Alcorn was one of approximately 700,000 trans people in the U.S. at large. Yet, analyzing this year’s Community Conversations readings, one might assume they do not exist at Harvard: the packet made only an oblique, one-sentence reference to gender diversity (a “surgeon could have been a woman first, and then a gay man, or vice-versa”).
The failure of such a platform to offer even cursory coverage of this issue is symptomatic of systematic and institutionalized trans exclusion at Harvard. Last year’s successful gender-neutral housing campaign won mixed-gender blocking groups for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the House system, but not for first-years. Harvard has an appalling paucity of gender-neutral restrooms. Very few faculty members and TFs ask for students’ preferred gender pronouns. And few students, Garrison-Desany said, are comfortable being out. Sexual assault workshops do not integrate the experiences of trans and gender-nonconforming students.
This exclusion is devastating.
Alcorn’s suicide is one of many: In a survey, 41 percent of transgender respondents said they had attempted suicide. The likelihood that transgender persons will do so increases if they are harassed or bullied in school, if they lose a job because of transphobia, and if they are physically or sexually assaulted.
Education on gender identity reduces stigma and harassment, but Harvard students are not getting this education. Indeed, the Community Conversations reading packet’s description of a “surgeon [who] could have been a woman first, and then a gay man” is ironic confirmation that education is sorely lacking and desperately needed. Directing focus toward the period in which a trans man was perceived as a woman, and endowing it with importance, is reductive and unfair. In fact, many transgender people do not identify with the gender they were assigned at birth, so the trans man referenced in the reading would likely never have identified as a woman.
This is the same misgendering to which Alcorn was subjected, her mother telling her “that [she] would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that [Leelah was] wrong.” The dangers of excluding and marginalizing transgender and gender-nonconforming students are real.
In April, representatives of The Diversity Report, a coalition of Harvard students of color, met with Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67. The students voiced various concerns about institutional support for minority students, and the representation of all genders in Community Conversations was among them.
“We did note that there were a lot of pieces missing on queer issues and trans issues from the packet,” Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15, a member of The Diversity Report, told me in an interview.
The Freshman Dean’s Office, Jinadasa said, seemed amenable to changes but noted that Harvard must purchase the right to reproduce readings. “It seems like… the FDO might not have wanted to or had the capacity to change the readings in that way.”
Willful apathy is not okay; concerns about the price of readings ring hollow given our nearly $40 billion endowment and the high rate of attempted suicide among transgender Americans.
“The world,” stressed Garrison-Desany, “is not a nice space for trans people.”
A majority of transgender Americans are mistreated at work and at school. Because of their gender identity and presentation, they are denied homes. They are harassed by the police and refused medical care. Like Alcorn, they are rejected by their friends and their families. They are misunderstood and marginalized by the people with whom they live.
Today’s Harvard students will become bosses and landlords. We will write laws, and enforce them. We will become doctors and parents, and we are already roommates. We will all impact the lives of transgender and gender-nonconforming people—without, it seems, learning about them or attending a school that really includes them.
Last week, Bruno Moguel Gallegos quoted Alcorn’s suicide note: “My death needs to mean something.” He offers a national agenda for policy change, but we have work to do at Harvard, too. All trans students must feel safe in restrooms and with their housing arrangements. More trans faculty members must feel safe enough to come out. Trans people must not be erased in our sexual assault workshops or in Community Conversations.
If we continue to exclude transgender and gender-nonconforming community members, we are complicit in the marginalization that is happening now—and in the discrimination, harassment, and suicides that will persist for years if we do not take action.
Leelah Alcorn’s death must mean something. At Harvard, it should mean an end to trans exclusion and the administration’s acknowledgement that no price is too high for the safety of our students. Above all, it should mean a staunch and definitive statement that transgender people exist, and that they belong here.
Of all the words in next year’s readings for Community Conversations, many more than one should be the word “transgender.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It wasn’t on my to-do list. It wasn’t a New Year’s resolution. I ate. I slept. I showered. I wrote in my journal. For nearly a year before starting college, I wrote in a journal regularly. It wasn’t regimented or planned. Just as I shower when I feel dirty, I wrote when it felt right to write.
I recounted events from my life—what I ate, where I went, and with whom. I filled pages with rants and opinions about things big, small, and positively minute. I wrote full essays, bullet points, and disjointed narratives cut off midline by my encroaching sleep cycle. I would stay up an extra few minutes because writing felt necessary. Some entries I could reread sitting in front of a fire and others I’d rather throw into one.
Since arriving at Harvard however, I’m thankful that I’ve felt the need to shower far more times than I’ve felt the impulse to journal. Recently, I realized I had only written three entries since August. I was about to add “journal” to my to-do list before I stopped. Journaling had been something I genuinely enjoyed and wanted to do.
What had changed?
Why should I force myself to do something I no longer desire?
Perhaps I loved writing because I was on a gap year when I began the exercise. I was meeting new and interesting people. I was able to live abroad for months at a time. I worked at an outdoor center and learned (or at least attempted to learn) a new language. I laughed while dangling from a bungee cord and screamed after jumping out of a helicopter. But freshman year is not as dissimilar as one might assume. It is possible that I met more people on the first day of FOP than I did during my entire gap year. I’m living within a tourist site, the type of place I sought out on my travels. I’m here to learn new languages, but also entirely new subjects. I’ve been a few feet from Vice President Biden and a few yards from Barbara Walters. I may not have screamed after jumping out of a helicopter since arriving on campus, but there have been bridges to jump off instead, and primal screams to let loose. So why don’t I feel compelled to write?
My gap year was an endeavor that I shared with no one else. I didn’t consistently have someone to turn to who would understand my stories without further contextualization. Here, on the other hand, I’m surrounded by people whose current experiences are much like my own. In many ways, simply by observing those around me, I see something to compare and contrast my own actions and days with. If I want to vent, I can walk into Annenberg and someone will understand where I’m coming from. I need not write down my daily activities because between my friends’ recollections and my own, I can piece them back together if necessary.
I’m not writing because I’m no longer alone. Colorful people have replaced my journal’s white pages. I feel securely a part of a community so much so that I am willing to rely on its collective memory and standards rather than write my own. In some ways this is beautiful thing, something I hoped to find in college.
But there’s a danger in this comfort as well.
I’m beginning to cherish this community because of the individuals who comprise it. But sometimes I worry we are too quick to give ourselves over to the communal experience. We live in close quarters and it can be hard to find time to be alone; most of us compile our memories in a common space online rather than documenting them ourselves; the norm is to discuss our days with each other rather than thinking about them on our own. Often it seems we reflect upon and judge our position within the Harvard community more often than as individuals.
In order to continue to contribute to a vibrant community we must demand that we continue to develop as individuals outside of it. In the past, I’ve found myself able to do that through writing. I may have initially dismissed the idea, but if placing “journal” on my to-do list gets me to put pen to paper, and make these valuable reflections, it’s worth it. Considering my individual experiences, in my own words, for myself, is a worthy endeavor, whether it comes naturally or needs a little provocation.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Testifying before the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Wednesday morning, Graduate School of Education professor Martin R. West emphasized the importance of annual standardized testing in grades 3-8.
“I would urge you not to lose sight of the positive aspects of No Child Left Behind,” he said Wednesday in his remarks to Congress, referring to the assessment-based education reform law passed in 2001. “Above all, the law’s requirement that students be tested annually...has provided parents, teachers, and other citizens with detailed information about students’ performance in these foundational subjects.”
“Research confirms that, by requiring states that had previously not implemented school accountability systems to do so, No Child Left Behind worked to generate modest improvements in student learning,” he continued.
The newly elected, Republican-controlled Congress has prioritized reforms to No Child Left Behind, and some members have proposed eliminating the law’s annual standardized testing mandate.
During an interview Tuesday, West said he thought he was chosen as a witness in part because he had worked for the committee in the past. West served as an education policy adviser last year to Senator A. Lamar Alexander, Jr., the committee’s chairman.
The hearing followed a research paper published Tuesday by West and Matthew M. Chingos, a senior fellow at the Brown Center on Education Policy.
In the paper, Chingos and West compare two metrics of success: test scores and test score improvement. Data on students in Florida and North Carolina suggests that, when evaluated on test scores alone, schools with more low-income students tend to perform worse than their wealthier counterparts. However, when judged by test score improvement, differences in income appear to affect performance less.
The paper concludes that judging schools on test scores rather than growth judges “the students they serve, not how well they serve them.”
In Tuesday’s interview, West said that he opposes reducing statewide standardized testing because doing so would make it impossible to evaluate students based on growth.
“To abandon that would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater [in an attempt to address] what are very real problems with the design of the No Child Left Behind accountability system,” he said.
Though West conceded that concerns about over-testing are legitimate, he said that it is probably not a “pervasive problem” and that it is not driven by year-end, annual state testing.

Federal funding for Harvard research fell by 5 percent to $608 million in the University’s fiscal year 2014, the first full Harvard fiscal year after the federal government enacted broad budget cuts collectively known as sequestration, according to the Office for Sponsored Program’s annual report.
During the same period, non-federal funding from external entities like corporations and foundations grew by 12 percent to $203.5 million, slightly cushioning the years-long decline in federal funding granted to Harvard researchers, according to the November 2014 report.
The decline in federal funding granted to Harvard researchers follows a national trend in American higher education since March of 2013, when the sequester—slated to progressively trim $1.2 trillion total from all federal programs over 10 years—first went into effect. University President Drew G. Faust has warned against the dangers of sequestration, stating in her 2013 commencement address that “great ideas that could lead to improved human lives and opportunities, and improved understanding, are left without support or the means for further development.”
Still, Catherine Breen, director of the Office for Sponsored Programs, said Harvard fared better than some expected.
“We had anticipated that the federal dollars would drop...between 7 and 10 percent, so we did slightly better,” Breen said.
The report also notes that the number of proposals for funding increased to 4,030 in 2014, up from 3,968 in 2013.While the overall number of submitted proposals has increased, however, the amount of money requested has decreased from $3.383 billion in 2013 to $2.848 billion in 2014.
According to Kevin Casey,  associate vice president for Public Affairs and Communications, the increasing number of proposals may indicate that researchers are spending more time writing grants and less time doing actual research.
“I think Harvard’s holding a high level competitive advantage because of the quality of our faculty, but they’re working harder, spending more time, and it’s become more stressful to the work,” he said.
Organismic and Evolutionary Biology professor Peter R. Girguis said in an interview in October that he has been able to continue his research afloat despite the sequester “in no small part due to the amount of effort I put into writing research proposals.”
“Where I might have had to submit four to five proposals a year to support a medium sized lab, the last few years I’ve doubled or tripled that effort,” he said, adding that “proposals take on the order of weeks to months; these are not done in a day.”
According to Breen, Harvard Medical School in 2014 submitted the most proposals with 1,331.
Although Breen and Casey said that faculty members have been creatively addressing the decline in federal funding by crowdsourcing funds and reaching out to corporations and foundations, both agree that these efforts will never fully replace government support. Casey said that moving forward, there may be even greater federal reductions in the coming years.
“We’re working to forestall those, but the forecast is cloudy still because of sequestration,” he said.
The Medical School requested the largest amount of money—$940.7 million—followed by the Harvard School of Public Health and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, “because of the sheer size of the school and the sort of breadth of research that they do,” Breen said. Of the $2.8 billion requested dollars for research, $1.7 billion came from the Longwood area of Harvard’s campus, comprised of the Medical School and the School of Public Health.
The 2014 report, unlike previous years, does not include financial breakdowns for each of Harvard’s individual schools. According to Breen, faculty overlap between schools and institutes made it difficult to determine which schools received certain funds.
The National Institute of Health continued to be Harvard’s main source of federal funding for research, offering $421 million. Unlike in previous years, the report did not specifically define Harvard’s lead non-federal funder, which has historically been the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but it noted that foundations on the whole provided the most non-federal funds to Harvard researchers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 200 demonstrators poured onto the streets of Central Square in Cambridge Wednesday evening, extending a series of marches and protests both nationwide and in the Greater Boston Area against racial prejudice in the criminal justice system.
“This is just a continuation,” Divinity School student Rachel A. Foran said, clutching a sign on which read “White silence is state violence.” Foran, like others at the event, emphasized the need for uniting in protest following two separate non-indictments of white police officers late last year who killed unarmed black men.
More than a dozen Cambridge Police Department officers followed the group as it marched from Jill Rhone Park toward the steps of the Cambridge City Council’s main building on Mass. Ave, with demonstrators blocking traffic along the way.
As participants began the first of two die-ins during which they laid on the street for four-and-a-half minutes—representing the 4.5 hours that Michael Brown’s body remained on the street before being taken to a morgue—Brian C. Greene, a bishop at the Pentecostal Tabernacle in Cambridge, listed off names of Cambridge residents who had died from violence in the past.
Greene also argued that the non-descript naming of the neighborhood where the march was held, Area 4, set it apart from other neighborhoods and made the area sound like a prison.
“Names are important…. If our lives do matter, let us at least start by giving this neighborhood a name instead of a number,” Greene said.
Shortly before demonstrators began to march, a band played jazz music, singing “Black lives matter everyday.”
Along the way, organizers handed off a milk crate podium to one another as they invited individuals to decry prejudices against African American men and implore Cambridge residents to join the movement.
“Our brothers are dying around this nation and I can’t sleep at night,” said Toni Bee, a Cambridge resident and organizer of Wednesday’s event.
Children peered out windows as the crowd proceeded and chanted “Indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail” periodically throughout the march.
Organizers later traced chalk outlines around the bodies of several participants in the second die-in, alluding to the outline law enforcement officers traced around Brown’s body.
Jeremy Warnick, a spokesperson for CPD, confirmed that officers did not arrest any protesters at the event, though they did pull one protester aside for questioning. He said that the march, like others in the past, was peaceful.
Warnick added that additional officers were on patrol during the march, but declined to comment on the exact number.
Protesters, meanwhile, encouraged other Cambridge residents to join the movement and inspire change.
“This is just the beginning,” Bee said.

UPDATED: January 23, 2015 at 2:41 a.m.
Michael J. Davidson, an assistant professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and the director of endovascular cardiac surgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, is remembered by colleagues as a pioneer in his field and as deeply caring for his patients.
Davidson died Tuesday after he was shot at the Brigham. He was 44.
An accomplished surgeon, Davidson graduated from Princeton in 1992 with a degree in philosophy and received his M.D. from Yale University School of Medicine in 1996. He did his residencies at Duke University Medical Center and the Brigham, where he was a staff member until his death.
Davidson was one of the first surgeons to be cross-trained in surgery and catheter interventions, according to Prem Shekar, an assistant professor of surgery at the Medical School. Writing in an email, Shekar recalled Davidson as a “trail-blazing surgeon.”
“He built himself a phenomenal reputation while remaining extremely down-to-earth, pleasant, and hard-working,” Shekar wrote.
Davidson helped pioneer a hybrid surgical and interventional cardiology program at the Brigham. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Davidson’s colleague, Pinak B. Shah, called Davidson “unique” for his skills as both a cardiac surgeon and an interventional cardiologist.
Shah, the interim director of the Brigham’s cardiac catheterization laboratory and an assistant professor at the Medical School, described Davidson as a “visionary” who foresaw the need for hybrid techniques to aid complex heart patients. He attributed the strength of the program to Davidson’s “innovative mind, his burning desire to push things along, and just an incredible skill set.”
At the press conference Wednesday, several of Davidson’s colleagues also commented on his kindness and care for his patients. Andrew C. Eisenhauer, an interventional cardiologist at the Brigham who was Davidson’s mentor when he entered the hospital’s training program, said Davidson’s “bottom line” was always, “What is best for the people we serve?”
Eisenhauer, who thought of Davidson as “almost always the smartest man in the room,” praised Davidson’s tendency to go above and beyond what was expected of a doctor. “He didn’t treat them just as patients,” Eisenhauer said. “He would treat them as people.”
Davidson was also an enthusiastic guitarist, according to his colleague and bandmate, Daniel C. Wiener, a surgeon at the Brigham. Along with other hospital colleagues, the two formed a band, named “Off Label”in light of medical humor, and mostly played classic rock. Davidson was also a fan of fly fishing, according to Medical School instructor Charles A. Morris, the Brigham’s associate director of primary care and Davidson’s classmate at Princeton.
He was also a loving father and husband, according to Eisenhauer, who recalled seeing “how love much there was between Mike and Terri and their children.”
Wiener said Davidson spoke passionately about his children during all their get-togethers. “I remember going to his house, and he had [son] Graham in his arms, and he was entertaining the girls,” Wiener said.
“I think that Mike was a magician, because I don’t know how he did what he did given the time allotted,” Morris said.
The Brigham flew its flag at half-mast during a ceremony held in Davidson’s honor Wednesday morning. The Brigham also held a vigil for Davidson at noon. More than 400 people came to the vigil, filling the venue over capacity, so the hospital held another vigil later in the afternoon, according to Erin McDonough, a spokesperson for the Brigham.
Davidson is survived by his three children, Kate, 9; Liv, 7, and Graham, 2; and his wife, Terri Halperin '97, who is pregnant with their fourth child.
Funeral services will be Friday at 10 a.m. at Temple Beth Elohim at 10 Bethel Rd. in Wellesley. The Brigham has established a fund at the RTN Federal Credit Union to benefit Davidson’s family.

Harvard could host up to 10 events in the 2024 Olympic Games if the International Olympic Committee selects Boston as the host city, according to Boston 2024 Olympic and Paralympic bid documents released Wednesday.
The documents include plans for Harvard venues to host aquatics, fencing, field hockey, tennis, and water polo for the Olympic Games, as well as five-a-side and seven-a-side football, swimming, wheelchair fencing, and wheelchair tennis for the Paralympic Games.
Field hockey would take place in Harvard Stadium, and fencing events in the existing Albert H. Gordon Track and Tennis Center, although both venues, if chosen, would see overlays built to accommodate Olympic competition.
Aquatics, swimming, and tennis would take place in venues that are slated be built in the first half of 2024, prior to the beginning of the summer Olympics and Paralympics.
In addition to Harvard, MIT, UMass Boston, and Boston University have offered their facilities for use during the games.
The Bid Committee has established partnerships with each university, according to its proposals. Katie N. Lapp, University executive vice president, serves on the committee’s College and University Engagement subcommittee along with administrators from area colleges. Lapp could not be reached for comment.
Bid documents emphasize the “university cluster” that Boston 2024 would feature, and the ease of travel between Harvard, MIT, and other university venues along the Charles River.
These university venues would complement venues in the “waterfront cluster,”  including the planned temporary Olympic Stadium, the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, and Boston Harbor.
If Boston’s bid is selected, the Games would be held from July 19 to Aug. 4, 2024, and the Paralympics from Aug. 14 to Aug. 25.
Boston was selected by the United States Olympic Committee as the U.S.’s official bid for the 2024 games earlier this month, but the IOC will not make its final selection until 2017.

Harvard Medical School and the Dubai Healthcare City Authority have partnered to establish a center for training and research on health care and medical treatment in the United Arab Emirates, the University announced on Tuesday.
The Harvard Medical School Center for Global Health Delivery—Dubai, as the center is called, will house research for delivery methods of health care treatment throughout the UAE, but it will not provide patient care, according to Medical School spokesperson Gina Vild.
The center is a new space in the pre-existing Mohammed Bin Rashid Academic Medical Center in Dubai Healthcare City, and will focus on “research and teaching to optimize systems for care delivery and patient outcomes,” Vild said.
According to David E. Golan ’75, dean for graduate education at the Medical School, the center will target four main areas: diabetes and obesity, improvements in surgical care, infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and hepatitis, and mental health. Harvard faculty will be involved in collaborative research projects, he said.
“The center is going to focus initially on pressing health challenges in Dubai and the United Arab Emirates,” Golan said. “We think it can be a central location that can allow us to convene in research education and policy discussion.”
Medical School associate professor Salmaan Keshavjee, who will direct the center, said it will “work with care providers here to conduct research on how they can improve their treatment delivery,” which Keshavjee said can come in a variety of different forms, ranging from a text message reminder to regular visits from a nurse.
The center hopes to offer Harvard Medical students the chance to do research there, according to Keshavjee, and may also involve Harvard undergraduates.
The new center is not the Medical School’s first collaboration in Dubai. With Partners Harvard Medical International and Dubai Healthcare City, the Medical School established the Harvard Medical School Dubai Center, an education and research institution, in 2004. That center “evolved” into the new global health delivery center, according to Medical School spokesperson David Cameron.
“HMS has had a relationship with Dubai for many years,” Keshavjee said. “Much of that relationship has been focused on how to increase research capacity in Dubai and the region and to strengthen the health care delivery infrastructure.”
According to Keshavjee, “Dubai has become an vital hub for the Middle East and for parts of Africa and for a significant part of South Asia.”
This means it is possible to reach a large portion of the UAE and beyond, Keshavjee said.
“Our reach is broad,” Keshavjee said. “Of course, we are thinking of the Middle East and North Africa, but we are also open to projects in India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and other places that have large populations of people working in the UAE. This center is focused on a broad region and on a set of problems to address the delivery of health care.”
Sehamuddin Galadari, Dubai Healthcare City Authority board member and an academic and research advisor for the Al Jalila Foundation, said he hopes that the new center in Dubai will allow Harvard and Dubai students to learn from each other.
“[The medical center] aims to complete the last mile of health care delivery,” Galadari said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED January 22, 2015, at 2:05 a.m.
Following a Supreme Court decision last Friday to hear arguments on the issue of same-sex marriage, several Harvard Law School professors predict that the Court will grant a historic constitutional right to same-sex marriage nationwide, but they say a more moderate outcome remains a possibility.
The Court will jointly judge four petitions from Michigan, Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee—states where the Sixth Circuit Court previously upheld bans on same-sex marriage—on two separate questions; the first will focus on whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to license same-sex marriages, and the second on whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to recognize same-sex marriages lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state.
“I would guess that the best reading of the tea leaves is that there will be five votes upholding a right to gay marriage,” Richard H. Fallon, a Law School professor, said. He along with Charles Fried and Michael J. Klarman, also Law School professors, identified Justice Anthony Kennedy as the potential “swing vote.”
While the professors interview said that the decision to hear the consolidated cases does not clearly forecast a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, they added that the Court’s recent history does suggest an affirmative answer to the first question. In particular, professors point to the Court’s 2013 ruling to strike down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in United States v. Windsor and its decision in October not to hear appeals to same-sex marriage rulings in five states—a step praised by members of the Harvard BGLTQ community.
Klarman wrote in an email that he feels “confident” that the Court will rule in favor of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
“I think there have probably been five votes for gay marriage for a couple of years, assuming the Court took the case. But not all of those five wanted to take the case,” Klarman wrote. “The sixth circuit created a circuit split and apparently that was sufficient to induce enough of the justices to vote in favor of [hearing the case].”
Law School professor and former Supreme Court clerk Laurence H. Tribe ’62 echoed the prediction in an email, writing that the he thinks the Court will “hold that the U.S. Constitution requires universal marriage equality.”
But professors said that the dual-pronged structure of the arguments leaves the Court a more moderate option that would stop short of same-sex marriage in all 50 states. The second question, which addresses recognizing out-of-state same-sex marriages, will only become relevant if the Justices reject the first question of a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.
“They are leaving their options open,” Fried, who served as U.S. solicitor general, said.
Mark V. Tushnet ’67, a Law School professor and former Supreme Court clerk, said that the addition of the second question allows the Court to “deal with the issue comprehensively, no matter the which way the first question came out.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking advantage of its size advantage and minimizing turnovers, the Harvard men's basketball team (11-4, 1-0 Ivy) overcame some weak shooting in the earlygoing Tuesday to bounce back from its loss to Boston College a week prior.
GETTING BIG
After missing nearly all of his junior campaign with a broken foot, senior center Kenyatta Smith found himself on the bench again Tuesday night, this time due to a sprained knee suffered his last time out at Boston College. Despite the absence of its 6’8” center, the Crimson was still able to utilize its size advantage in the 66-57 win over Bryant (8-8, 5-1 NEC).
The height difference was noticeable at nearly every position. On the interior, captain Steve Moundou-Missi and sophomore Zena Edosomwan quickly picked up the slack for Smith. The duo combined for 28 points, 12 of which came from the charity stripe, as the Bulldogs were forced to foul in order to contain the big men.
"[Smith] is like one of my big brothers on the team along with all the other bigs," Edosomwan said. "It was obviously tough losing him, so when coach [Amaker] told me I was starting, all I wanted to do was contribute."
Both Moundou-Missi and Edosomwan also found success on the defensive end, blocking two shots and one shot, respectively, as well as altering plenty more. In fact, Moundou-Missi moved into fifth place on Harvard's all-time career blocks list with his 112th blocked shot.
“We were able to get a cushion and push it through with [Steve and Zena],” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “These two guys came through big time for us in the second half."
On the perimeter, senior Wesley Saunders and junior Agunwa Okolie both stood a solid four inches over their defenders. As a result, both Saunders and Okolie, who combined for 18 points, were able to drive to the paint and rise above their defenders.
Furthermore, they were able to use their length to frustrate Bryant’s leading scorer, sophomore Dyami Starks, holding the guard under 32 percent shooting from the floor.
Though Starks would finish the night with a game-high 18 points, Saunders and Okolie both used their significant size advantage to slow him down.
"Agunwa [was] a really good defensive stopper on the perimeter—he and Wesley both," Amaker said. "We need every layer...so the fact that [we] are relying on each other, which is the way basketball should be played, I love it."
TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF
Taking care of the ball has been one of the biggest conundrums for the Crimson this season. In its four losses this year, Harvard has averaged 16 turnovers, and its inability to handle the rock has proven to be an Achilles heel for Amaker’s squad.
On Tuesday night, the Crimson turned the ball over just eight times, only the third time this year it has recorded fewer than 10 giveaways. Much of that success can be attributed to the focus and tenacity that junior point guard Siyani Chambers brought to the hardwood.
"I thought [Siyani] played a good floor game...and I thought he did a terrific job pressuring the ball throughout the game," Amaker said. "That was one of the keys for us."
The speedy Chambers pushed the ball up the court from the opening whistle, enforcing his pace into the game and challenging Bryant’s guards to stay with him.
Chambers finished the night with only a single turnover, which allowed him to continue to run the break without worrying about wasting possessions. Similarly, Saunders only turned the ball over once, following a tough loss against Boston College where the reigning Ivy League Player of the Year had seven turnovers.
IN-AND-OUT
For the first seven minutes of Tuesday’s contest, Harvard struggled to score, as it pounded the ball inside to Edosomwan. Nonetheless, the constant dishing inside did pay early dividends.
After struggling to get off the block early at the Chace Athletic Center, Chambers found sophomore sharpshooter Corbin Miller in the corner, who swiftly knocked down a rhythm jumper from beyond the arc. The three sparked a much needed 9-0 run for Harvard, igniting the offense and helping spread the Bulldogs defense.
“We always try to play inside-out,” Amaker said. “We are a little on egg shells with our post guys. As the game went on, and they had some more success, I thought they became a little bit more confident."
While Harvard would only add two more buckets from three-point range, the post presence of Moundou-Missi and Edosomwan created open jump shots for both Miller and Chambers. As a result, the Crimson may have found its identity just in time before heading back into conference play against Dartmouth Saturday.
In recent years, sharpshooter Laurent Rivard ‘14, Harvard’s all-time leading three-point shooter, would stretch defenses by creating lanes for both Saunders and Chambers to attack the basket. This season, the absence of Rivard has caused those lanes to become much tighter, as wing players are able to help off the ball and clog up the lane.
As a result, the ability of Moundou-Missi and Edosomwan to assert themselves provided a window into a different offensive attack that could prove vital for Harvard in the Ancient Eight. Though Harvard will certainly have to shoot a higher percentage from beyond the arc to be successful in Ivy League play, the Crimson will exercise a similar interior height advantage, which should leave Miller and Chambers open to knock down jump shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Playing at home for the first time in over two months, the Harvard women’s tennis team opened its spring season with a bang Monday, picking up a shutout victory against Rhode Island.
From the confines of the Murr Center, the Crimson (1-0) earned the doubles point and six straight singles victories en route to a 7-0 win over the Rams (0-1).
Coming off of a tournament-heavy fall schedule, Harvard was eager to try its hand at a dual contest. Prior to Monday, the Crimson had not competed since November, and the team has had a limited amount of practice time since returning from the winter break. In addition, Harvard’s three freshmen had yet to play in a match of this format.
“Since we have a lot of new freshmen on the team, dual matches are really new to them,” sophomore June Lee said. “So we wanted to make sure that we had a lot of high energy and [that] we were really positive and just pumping each other up the whole time.”
Freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten was one of the few players missing from the Crimson lineup. The rookie proved herself to be a key competitor with her fall tournament performances, the latest of which was an “A” flight singles championship at the Harvard Invitational.
But even without Jang-Milsten, the Crimson stepped out onto the court ready to deliver. At the first singles spot, Lee scored point after point, soundly defeating URI senior Kathleen Uy with a pair of 6-0 sets, giving herself a chance to watch the rest of her teammates from the sideline.
“[We want to] just be a close team, everyone getting along, just [being] positive,” Lee said. “That’s a big part of what helps us win.”
At second singles, freshman Nikki Kallenberg took on Rams’ junior Elizaveta Sadovnikova. Kallenberg, who was ranked the 11th best recruit in the class of 2014 by Tennis Recruiting, allowed Sadovnikova to earn just a single point, beating her opponent, 6-0, 6-1.
URI, whose roster does not feature any freshman, was beaten again and again by the young Harvard team. Kallenberg, paired with fellow rookie Annika Ringblom, notched another victory at the second doubles position. The first-years bested the team of Uy and Sadovnikova in the day’s closest contest, 8-4.
Ringblom’s other performance came at third singles, where she left opponent Jordan Rucks scoreless, giving the Crimson another victory in straight sets to finish the day with a 20-4 record.
Captain Sylvia Li attributes the success of the freshmen to their ability to balance their academic, social, and athletic lives, as well as the support system the team provides.
“On the court they have a little less pressure because they’re handling [themselves] off the court so well,” Li said. “Also, our coaches do a really great job helping make the transition into college tennis a lot easier. And everyone else on the team—they have all been very supportive.”
Sophomore Monica Lin picked up another point for Harvard, beating the Rams’ Anna Peacock in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.
Lin and Peacock had faced off once before in the first doubles match, but that result was hardly as close. Determined to set the tone for the match, Lin and Lee began the day’s doubles play by defeating the pair of Rucks and Peacock, 8-0.
Singles play continued with junior Amy He winning on court five, 6-0, 6-2. The junior was the only member of the Crimson not to compete in a doubles match as well.
Li occupied the sixth and final singles spot, producing the second sweep of the day, 6-0, 6-0. Earlier in the day, Li won her doubles match on court three alongside junior Amanda Lin, 8-0, finishing the day with a perfect record.
By day's end, Harvard won by a combined score of 96-14. But according to Li, the score was not the Crimson’s main focus.
“We want to come out as strong as possible but there is stuff that we will continue to improve on during the season,” Li said. “We already know what we’re doing well, what we can do better. As long as we improve throughout the season I know that by the time we make it to Ivies we can do really well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s basketball team (11-4, 1-0 Ivy) closed nonconference play with a 66-57 victory over Bryant on Tuesday night. After playing six of its previous seven games on the road, the Crimson will return home to Lavietes Pavilion to take on Dartmouth (7-8, 0-1 Ivy) Saturday afternoon. Below, The Back Page takes a look at the three main things to keep your eye on as Harvard looks to maintain its perfect home record.
Is Zena Ready?
How things turn. After barely leaving the bench in an overtime loss to Boston College, sophomore Zena Edosomwan got the first meaningful start of his career against the Bulldogs. With 13 points and eight rebounds in just 24 minutes, the Los Angeles native delivered. After a rocky start, Edosomwan had four points and four rebounds in the Crimson’s 8-0 run that clinched the victory.
Although he cannot match senior center Kenyatta Smith’s contributions on the defensive end—the sophomore is a better rebounder but a vastly inferior shot blocker—Edosomwan stands a good chance at matching the senior’s contributions due to his offensive prowess. While he is a black hole on this end of the floor (29.0 percent usage rate, 1.7 percent assist rate), he does a good job getting to the line and rarely turns the ball over. His post game has improved dramatically (43.9 percent effective field goal percentage in 2013-2014), and he is by far the team’s best offensive rebounding threat.

Turnovers, Turnovers, Turnovers
After the team’s win in Hanover two weeks ago, all that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker focused on afterwards was turnovers. Specifically, 17 of them—six by starting point guard Siyani Chambers against just four assists. The Crimson had just eight turnovers against Bryant, and Chambers and Okolie—the two most likely culprits—had only three between them. With only one consistent threat to drive the ball on offense in senior wing Wesley Saunders and a lack of shooters around him, Harvard will be scraping for points all year. Understandably, then, Amaker is focused on eliminating silly turnovers; teams rarely get a good chance to score against the Crimson’s defense when it gets set, and offensively, Harvard has enough to fight without getting in its own way as well.
Mitigating Mitola
In its previous victory against Dartmouth, Harvard clamped down on the Big Green offense by limiting focal point Alex Mitola to 2-for-9 shooting overall. Mitola fills a similar offensive role for the Big Green as junior wing Wesley Saunders does for Harvard as the team’s best—and sometimes, only—playmaker on the roster. The guard has the second-highest assist rate and highest true shooting percentage among the Big Green, with a 123.1 offensive rating that is nearly 14 points higher than the rest of the roster. He rarely turns the ball over—just one against Harvard—and is just as three-happy as Stephen Curry, shooting seven-and-a-half a game at a 40.7 percent clip. If Harvard wants to pull off the clean sweep, it should dust off the old game plan; without Mitola scoring, Dartmouth stands little chance.
