After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that the gloomiest chapter of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences budget crisis is done, we are beginning to understand how severe the situation was. Two years ago, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith held a Town Hall meeting, during which he described a “sizable and somewhat daunting challenge”—a projected budget deficit of $220 million dollars in the 2010-2011 academic year. In the 2010 Dean’s Annual Report, that figure was repeatedly called “crushing,” revealing the despair behind Smith’s apparent calm.
Indeed, the period after the deficit was announced was a tough one for the Harvard community. Many of the budget cuts made were painful, including freezing the salaries of faculty and nonunion staff members, mass layoffs of staff members and providing retirement incentives for others to retire, curtailing searches for new faculty from 50 to 21, and reducing capital spending. Additionally, Smith asked departments and centers to pare down their budgets by 15 percent for the 2009-2010 academic year.
Dean Smith encountered a significant amount of criticism in the community when these cuts were made. As reported in The Boston Globe, Government Professor Theda Skocpol said, “Harvard’s relative standing among the major universities will suffer.” In the same article, Professor of African-American music Ingrid Monson—and interim FAS dean—was quoted as saying, “Everyone is worried here that no matter what they say, the level of cuts that are required threatens to change the character of this institution.’’ The New York Times education section even pronounced that “the euphoria of fall in Harvard Yard is dampened.”
The Crimson itself did not agree with most of these cuts when they were made. Of the retirement incentives, we said: “While cost-cutting measures are certainly necessary given the FAS financial situation, trimming the faculty to decrease costs harms a central mission of the University to maintain the highest standard of education possible.” Of the faculty hiring slowdown we said that “impeding the College’s flow of intellectual resources is an unwise compromise.”  
And yet, it is a tremendous relief to see that the projected deficit this academic year is only $35 million. This is an extraordinary feat. FAS is certainly in a much better place financially than it was three years ago, and it is certainly due to the combined effect of the tough decisions Dean Smith relayed. We praise him for handling the budget to the extent that he has and for accomplishing the majority of FAS's goal, despite the backlash to budget cuts.
Despite all these accomplishments, however, it's a good time to look back at the entirety of FAS's decisions. This was the first time in recent years that the administration encountered an economic crisis of this magnitude, and the correct path wasn't always clear. Nevertheless, moving forward, it should be evident now that clear-cut academic interests should never be jeopardized in favor of administrative ones. This was not always the case in this present budget crisis. For example, centralization of Harvard’s various small academic centers and departments never happened, although it was talked about extensively. Harvard is an academic institution, and its longevity depends on the protection of academic interests.
Moving forward, we hope Harvard will analyze the long-term effects of its budget cuts as it enters the future. The full effect of the faculty hiring slowdown or the bulk of retirements can only be determined in the future, when the health of the affected academic departments are examined over time. Still, handling a $35 million deficit is better than handling a $220 one, and, for this, we can be thankful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What the Israeli government is doing to the Palestinians is disgusting,” said singer-song writer Macy Gray as she tried to decide whether or not she was going to perform in Israel in January. Like many artists before her who’ve had concerts in the Jewish state, Gray was concerned about how her performance there would reflect her views on the Israel-Palestine situation.
Of course, Macy Gray is not the first artist to have had these qualms—recently, many performers have decided that boycotting Israel could be their way of showing their distaste with the Israeli government’s attitudes and actions toward the Palestinian people. British singer-songwriter Elvis Costello, who cancelled two concerts scheduled for this past June, said that it had “been necessary to dial out the falsehoods of propaganda, the double game and hysterical language of politics” before making his decision. In turn, the Israeli government has publicly chastised Costello, the Pixies, and other artists who have boycotted Israel. Of Costello, for instance, Israel’s Culture and Sports Minister Limor Liynat went so far as to say: “An artist boycotting his fans in Israel is unworthy of performing here.”
Despite all this attention, however, many have still failed to grasp the message these artists are trying to convey.
Although Macy Gray felt that her absence would ultimately fail to make a difference, many other songwriters feel differently, and their boycotts may have shed new light on the situation. Even though the Israeli government remains unconcerned with the obvious disapproval it has been received from artists all over the world, its citizens might have been inspired to look further into the situation and to try and understand the reasons behind such drastic actions, albeit in the realm of popular culture.
In fact, a cultural boycott is something that will obviously affect the people of Israel rather than the Israeli government, as proven by the government’s choice to ignore the boycotts and move forward with its political agenda. Most recently, Israel has released a statement saying that it considers its attack on the Freedom Flotilla legal under international law. Israel continues to defend Operation Cast Lead and the murder of around 1,400 citizens, and its government officials even say that they would be willing to repeat the attack. The siege on Gaza continues even though it has been exposed that the blockade was meant to “push the area’s economy to the brink of collapse.” Permits allowing the rebuilding of Gaza have been slowed down, thanks to “burdensome bureaucratic conditions,” and citizens are forced to rebuild their homes out of the one material of which they have an abundance—sand.
While it may be unfair that plenty of Israeli citizens must suffer from this cultural boycott due to the actions of their government, the boycotts stand as a disapproving reminder that around a thousand women and children had to die two years ago largely because of the Israeli government. Many citizens continue to suffer, whether by the Israeli occupation of the West Bank or the continued siege of Gaza. The protests may have no impact on the Israeli government, but at least they may influence Israeli citizens. In that sense, the least these artists can do is to continue their purposeful inaction—and hopefully make a difference in the future.

Making a difference has become so easy. With just one click you can support a cause on Facebook. Until recently, in just a few seconds you could have texted “Haiti” to the Red Cross to donate $10 in the aftermath of last year’s catastrophic earthquake. And now, through the new website www.philanthroper.com, you can click to give $1 to the featured cause of the day.
Commonlt called the “Groupon” of the charity world, Philanthroper has been lauded for making giving so simple and painless that anyone with a dollar to spare can do it. The site appears to be incredibly efficient, spending only one percent of donations on transactional fees and giving the rest to the social organizations it promotes. The first few causes—which included organizations that provide free art classes to underprivileged children, distribute free school supplies, and provide free counseling to veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression—typically attracted 100-300 donors each. According to the site’s FAQ , “We're trying to make doing good a habit.”
But is one-click giving really the same as “doing good?” Certainly, it democratizes philanthropy, allowing more people to participate in giving to and supporting causes and organizations that may be creating real social impact. But platforms that strive to make giving as effortless as possible are at the same time giving rise to a new culture of disengaged philanthropy. By making giving so easy that it requires hardly any thought, we are making philanthropy a mindless, one-click act that requires no real engagement with the cause or knowledge of the actual social impact it is creating.
The truth is that making spur-of-the-moment contributions allows donors to feel good about making a difference without necessarily thinking critically about the causes we support. According to a recent Harvard Business School (HBS) study, spending money on others can increase our personal happiness. Thus, even engaging superficially with causes by making quick and sometimes thoughtless donations can allow us to think we are making a difference.
It is even easier to fall into this pattern of disengaged philanthropy when we are surrounded by ads and announcements telling us that with “Just $x” we can give one person clean, safe drinking water, a year of education, or some other social good. Of course, donations can help improve social conditions in various ways, but it is misguided to believe that simply giving money—especially without following up on the measurable outcomes of the project—is enough to effect meaningful social change. 
 
This is not to devalue the new social media and technologies that help raise awareness and funds for a multitude of charities. The problem is that this is simply not enough. Thoughtlessly “Liking” charities’ Facebook pages or clicking once to make a donation is no substitute for being an active, engaged citizen who thinks critically about social issues and social change. According to Joe Green, a Co-Founder of the Facebook Causes application, these new ways of giving are filling a void for a generation that just doesn’t know how to make a difference. “This generation of college students cares incredibly deeply about changing the world, and probably has expressed more interest, in fact, in that of any generation since the 60s but doesn’t understand how to do it,” he told MSNBC.
It is alarming that the modern culture of giving encourages such a superficial interface with effecting true social change. What we need is a culture of active and engaged philanthropy, of citizens who not only support, advocate for, and donate to causes and organizations they support, but who also think critically about social problems and seek to understand how organizations use their donations to make a real difference. Of course, there are different levels of engagement; not everybody spends time volunteering or working for organizations that do hands-on social work, and not everybody goes to rallies or publicly advocates for particular causes. There are roles for people to be involved to a different extent. But if we are to become a truly socially conscious generation, we cannot rely on making a few clicks or sending the occasional text message and expect this to change the world. We need people who will be truly engaged with the social issues facing our generation and our time.

The Israeli discourse following events in Egypt can be characterized as varying from pessimistic concern to hysteric paranoia. Speculations about the future stability of the region are flooding the newspapers so much that it seems like Israel has forgotten it has played a major role in the region’s most infamous destabilizing factor, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With such an active public debate, it is perplexing to see that in the week prior to the protests in Egypt, Israelis were rather apathetic in response to the Palestine papers, recently leaked confidential documents from Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in the past 10 years.
There are several potential reasons why these controversially leaked papers have not garnered as much press as they ought. The papers—leaked to al-Jazeera and published in collaboration with The Guardian two weeks ago—reveal surprising concessions made on the Palestinian side and rejected by the Israelis in the 2007-2008 peace talks. This revelation undermines the cornerstone of Israel’s sense of moral superiority. Growing up in Israel in the 2000s, I have come to know all-too-well the oft-repeated mantra of self-affirmation that “there is no partner for peace talks.” In light of these documents, it is time for Israelis to reexamine this mantra.
Indeed, the image of the peace-refusing Palestinian runs so deep in Israel that for many it is now a presupposition for approaching negotiations. In his article “An Exercise in Empathy” of Feb. 1st, Avishai D. Don ’12 describes how participating in a negotiation simulation between Israeli and Palestinian delegates helped him understand the different paradigms each side brings to the negotiation table. Don draws the two different mindsets of the parties in rather broad strokes. For him, the Israeli mindset is concerned with “pragmatism and security,” while the Palestinian mindset seems more concerned with human rights and justice. Don’s conclusion that this basic difference in paradigms is why the peace talks in his simulation—as well as the ones in real life—failed presents us with a rather simple equation: Israel is here to talk business and put an end to the conflict, while the Palestinians are stubbornly upholding the banner of uncompromising justice.
Yet, the Palestine papers throw this analysis of the Israeli and Palestinian psyches into question.  In fact, as these papers reveal, Israel takes the lead in becoming the region’s top peace refuser. It turns out that Saeb Erekat, chief Palestinian negotiator at the time, recognized Israel as a Jewish state, comparing it to other Middle Eastern states which define themselves as Arab or Muslim. This could have presented Israeli negotiators with a golden opportunity to get past some of the ideological barriers and discuss the practicalities of a feasible agreement. However, Erekat’s Israeli counterpart, Tzipi Livni, then Israeli foreign minister and now opposition leader, decided to redefine the Jewish state and promote a radical agenda of population swaps.
Formerly associated with far-right groups, the support for a transfer of Arab-Israeli citizens to the future Palestinian state as a part of a long-term agreement is particularly alarming coming from Livni. Livni—leader of the opposition and current chair of the largest party in the Knesset, Kadima—has positioned herself to represent the left in Israel’s ever-narrowing political spectrum. The recent collapse of the Labor party, the traditional torch-carrier for the Zionist-left, has left a void that could not be filled by the marginal leftist parties, and Livni seemed to find her way into that void. She did so conveniently without changing her position on key issues and without expressing reservations about oppressive government policies. In fact, Livni was placed in this position simply by virtue of not joining a coalition—composed of Netanyahu and Lieberman.
After having redefined the term “left” by means of contrast—not Netanyahu—Livni continues with her etymological endeavor and redefines the Jewish state—not Arab—by means of population swaps. The main issue is that Israel has long been defined as a Jewish and Democratic state. The dissonance between the two ideological pillars of Israel is the main reason that it has failed for nearly 63 years to adopt a constitution, and the attempt to strike a balance has been the main debate between the left and right in national political discourse. In the past year, the democratic movement in Israel suffered several hard blows from the Netanyahu-Lieberman government, but having the so-called representative of the left blatantly disregard democratic values was, up until recently, still somewhat of a novelty. The line dividing opposition from the government has been blurred to the extent that even several progressive columnists, such as Aluf Benn, now regard autonomy in settlement blocks a non-issue in internal Israeli discourse.
The Palestine papers are groundbreaking documents in more than one way. They show that Palestinian negotiators approached the negotiations with a set of serious propositions. But they not only demonstrate that Israel in fact has a partner for peace talks—they also present Israel with a choice. Indeed, Israel can either reclaim its democratic values and drop the transfer plan, or it can drop the pretenses and assert its position as the regional peace refuser.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Amid calls for highly selective universities to increase enrollment in order to ease pressure on high school seniors, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said yesterday that Harvard College and its peers are unlikely to boost the number of students they admit.
After Sandy Baum, a professor emeritus at Skidmore College, and Michael S. McPherson, a former president of Macalester College, argued at a conference in January that enrollment numbers should be increased, a debate arose in online forums and among education professionals about whether elite institutions of higher learning should increase the number of students they admit. Upping the number of spots for freshmen would reduce the stresses on applicants and improve the quality of applicants’ high school educations, Baum and McPherson said.
“We think it’s great that we have such highly selective institutions, but it’s clear that there are more qualified students than they can enroll,” Baum said. “As acceptance rates go down, things just get more and more frantic.”
McPherson—the current president of the Spencer Foundation, which funds research in education—said that applicants to elite colleges feel obligated to participate in activities just for the purpose of including them on an application.
“Students feel a lot of pressure in high school to take every AP course that’s offered. They feel a lot of pressure to never take a course where they risk getting less than an A,” he said. “Those are educationally undesirable things.”
While Fitzsimmons acknowledged that plummeting admissions rates have created a high level of stress and anxiety for applicants, he said that increasing enrollment is not something that the College can consider seriously. According to Fitzsimmons, the College has already increased the size of the freshman class to maximum capacity over the past ten years.
“We would love to be able to admit more people, but there’s no place to put them. There are constraints,” said Fitzsimmons, who noted that the construction of new dormitories would be prohibitively expensive and that an increased class size would lead to a dilution of resources available to students.
McPherson said that while funding an expansion is an issue, it is something the College could have done if it had chosen to do so.
“Think about the many ways the undergraduate experience was enriched in the [past ten years],” McPherson said. “What if instead of spending more on students you have, you use some of those additional revenues to expand enrollment?”
But Fitzsimmons said he believes that the benefits of a larger applicant pool outweigh its downsides.
“In many respects, places like [Harvard] have been democratized. You really have an applicant pool that is much more representative of the world,” Fitzsimmons said.
Bridget T. Long, professor of education and economics at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that while the public would benefit from increased enrollment, such an increase probably would not make a substantial difference in the larger scheme of things.
“Will that be much of a drop in the bucket? Probably not,” she said. “Highly selective schools are really only catering to 5 percent of students.”

One semester after the Government Department added a new Peer Concentration Counselor (PCC) program to its advising structure, those involved have reported low response rates from concentrators in a large department that has struggled with improving concentrator satisfaction.
“We are aware from talking to PCCs that many of them have not been sought out, and are thinking of ways to raise their visibility,” Director of Undergraduate Studies Cheryl B. Welch said in an e-mail about the new student advisers.
With the second largest pool of undergraduate concentrators, the Government Department has consistently ranked low in the annual senior exit survey among concentrations. While showing improvements since 2008, the 2010 survey ranked the department fourth to last in the College, with an average rating of 3.92 on a 5 point scale.
Government Department Chair Timothy J. Colton said the department plans to hold a thorough review of the concentration, including the advising system, this fall.
Many of the PCCs, informal advisers who are not assigned advisees, report having been contacted only by two or three students in a department that counts more than 400 undergraduates as concentrators.
“[The PCCs] are ready to talk to people, and they haven’t talked to as many people as they want,” Welch said on Monday.
The concerns over the limited utilization of the new advising initiative was addressed at a meeting last semester that included Welch, Coordinator of Undergraduate Studies Karen Kaletka, and the PCCs.
According to Welch, the Government Department has taken a number of measures to publicize the new program. Along with creating a page for each PCC on the department’s website, all department faculty, government concentrators, and pre-concentrators were e-mailed about the new program.
“Part of the reason [for the low student response rate] is because it’s a new program and people are still utilizing the other channels,” said Daniel M. Chung ’11, who after his first semester as a PCC recalls having had conversations with a total of three concentrators and pre-concentrators.
Shan Zhu ’11, who has not been contacted by anyone seeking help from a PCC, dismissed the possibility that the program hasn’t taken off simply due to the fact that it is new.
“If people aren’t asking us questions, then they aren’t interested,” she said.
To increase awareness of the program, the department plans to provide the PCCs with funds for them to hold welcome events for freshmen after this year’s housing lottery, according to Welch.
The PCCs, a group of 16 juniors and seniors, began their role last fall as the Government
Department continued its campaign to reach out to concentrators.
“We’re supposed to have more of an insider perspective on the department. We’re there to tell them what certain courses are like, what kind of professor I should seek out, what sort of internship opportunities are available, and things like that,” Chung said.
“It also helps because students feel more comfortable talking to other students about their concerns,” PCC Gregory A. DiBella ‘12 added.
The creation of the PCC program last spring was part of a series of advising initiatives designed to bring advising resources closer to students. It adds to the department’s move, begun in 2006, towards a house-based advising system in which each house is assigned a resident and non-resident tutor.
The PCC program provides a direct network of peers for students to reach out to based on their own concentration and career plans.
“We try to kind of get a balanced group—men, women, people who are athletes, people who are intending to write a thesis, people who think they won’t write a thesis, and so on,” Welch said.

A first-year Harvard Law School student died on Monday, according to Law School administrators.
Gregory C.M. Tang was a law student who had worked as an engineer before enrolling at the Law School.
The medical examiner has not provided the school with any official information about Tang’s death, according to Dean of Students Ellen Cosgrove.
The Law School student body was notified by an e-mail from Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow sent yesterday.
Cosgrove said that students with whom she had spoken have repeatedly emphasized that Tang was “adventurous and enthusiastic, and someone who had great perspective.”
“They all said he was a ‘chill’ guy,” Cosgrove said.
Tang participated in the Harvard Journal of Law & Technology as well as the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association.
Co-President of APALSA Jeremy N. Tran described Tang as “very kind” and “a little quiet.” “He was a great person and everyone absolutely adored him,” said Tran.
“He was a wonderful person, and I think very highly of him.”
According to Tran, Tang had accompanied APALSA members on a ski trip this past weekend. Learning of Tang’s death “was kind of a shock for all of us,” Tran said.
APALSA held a gathering last night to offer support to its members and to “let them know that we’re here.”
Tang graduated summa cum laude from the University of Michigan and received an M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford. Cosgrove said that the Law School plans to hold an event to commemorate Tang’s life. Though specific arrangements have not been made, Cosgrove said that she will meet with students to plan something “meaningful for the community.” Memorial Church has offered its space for a service, Cosgrove said.
According to Tran, Tang’s classmates from his course section have discussed participating in the memorial or creating a memory book.
“In his short time here, Gregory Tang added astute, well-grounded legal judgment to our community and, more importantly, always did so with good humor and respect for others,” Professor John Manning, Tang’s section leader, said in the e-mail sent to the student body. “We will miss him sorely.”
“When tragic things happen we need to turn to community, and we are fortunate to have a wonderful community here,” Minow wrote in her e-mail.

Members of the Harvard College Democrats gathered last night to discuss whether the exclusion of trans-identified individuals from the military should prevent the return of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps program to campus. Though the organization did not take a formal vote on the matter, those who spoke at the meeting by and large said that ROTC should be welcomed back to Harvard, despite objections over trans exclusion.
Though the Senate repealed “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell”—which excludes gays, lesbians, and bisexuals from joining the military—in December, trans individuals are still not allowed to join the armed forces.
While the policy’s repeal in December allowed gays and lesbians to serve in the military, transgender and intersex individuals are still forbidden to enlist because gender identity disorders are considered to be medical disqualifications. Transgender describes individuals whose gender identity does not align with the sex assignment they were born with. Intersex refers to people who are born with a combination of male and female physical features.
Citing a transgender person he knows at Harvard who was disqualified from joining the military because of his sexual identity, Jia Hui Lee ’12, a presenter from Harvard Trans Task Force, told the members about an ongoing petition reaffirming Harvard’s commitment to non-discrimination policy regardless of an individual’s gender identity.
According to Lee, other countries in the world, including Thailand and Australia, allow transgender individuals to join the military.
Hands shot up in the air as about 25 students who gathered at the Adams House upper common room awaited their turn to speak.
Tori E. Wenger ’14 suggested that rather than protesting against ROTC’s exclusion of transgender individuals, the Democrats should work with lawmakers to make changes in the law and raise public awareness.
Jimmy P. Biblarz ’14 said that the College Dems should defer decisions on the issue to the national Democratic party and Harvard administrators.
“We are not the decision-making body for Harvard. We are the Harvard College Democrats, so we need to support the return of ROTC because that’s what the party did. That’s what Obama did,” he said.
Adding to Biblarz’s statement, Wenger said that she agreed that the objective is to eventually allow transgender individuals to serve in the military, but that the current policy should be embraced as a step forward for gay and lesbian rights in the U.S.

Kevin T. Mintz ’12 has an IQ of 150, but, due to cerebral palsy, he is wheelchair-bound and speaks slowly and with apparent difficulty. For individuals with a physical disability, Mintz is an exception in an educational system that experts said yesterday consistently fails to address the needs of students with disabilities.
At a panel at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, the assembled experts said that the 1990 Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), which expanded and regulated the services distributed to children with disabilities, has failed to provide adequate preparation for an independent lifestyle.
Thomas Hehir, an Ed School professor and former adviser to President Clinton on the 1997 reauthorization of IDEA, said that people often look at educational opportunities for students with disabilities as “charity.”
“Denying a kid with a disability equal education is a violation of civil rights,” Hehir said. “There isn’t quite the level of urgency around these issues.”
Television host Chris Matthews moderated the event, which also included David Ticchi—one of the first blind teachers in Massachusetts and Matthews’ first-year roommate at Holy Cross.
Hehir said that the United States has come far in its inclusion of students with disabilities but also contended that funds allocated toward the education of individuals with disabilities “are often used to segregate kids.”
Mintz, who graduated valedictorian of his high school class and was the first student with a physical disability in Miami-Dade County to be taught alongside his peers without disabilities, said that his life was dramatically altered by the provisions of IDEA—such as early intervention at age one, and undergoing surgery in order to simply sit up in a chair.
But he also criticized the act for not teaching students with disabilities to be self-sufficient.
“Where IDEA truly fails is in assuring there will be a strategy in place after students get their diploma, and I say that from experience,” Mintz said. “The law should be designed for people with disabilities not to live dependently but interdependently.”
Mintz said that because therapists were less knowledgeable than him about algebra and biology, he had little choice but to work with his father for five years. As a result, Mintz said he had little interaction with his peers.
“Under no circumstances should that be acceptable,” Mintz said. “I was socially isolated.”
While IDEA has sought to improve the educational experiences of individuals like Mintz, it has fallen largely short of its goals, according to Hehir.
“The bill is not self-implementing. It’s great that we have it, but it depends on people doing the right thing. I think the federal governmment needs to do more,” he said. “We have so far to go.”

Top administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences yesterday presented to FAS and University IT officials the full transition schedule for the merger of the University’s two largest IT operations.
The  planning phase of the the consolidation of IT systems, first announced  in March 2010, is scheduled to be complete this June, University Chief  Information Officer Anne H. Margulies said during the presentation. The planning phase will be followed by an implementation process, which is currently expected to take another year.
The key goals of the initiative are to “enable strategic investment and use of IT, redirect resources to highest and best purpose, [and] elevate level of service,” said Director of Strategy & Program Management Catherine Cho Yoo.
The new IT leadership will review options to reform the current bureaucratic structure, which is “complex, ad-hoc, [and] redundant,” Margulies said.
Of the 783 different job titles with IT-related jobs at Harvard, 80 percent are unique to individuals, Margulies added.
“So far what we know is we spend about $200 million [on IT services across the University] a year. What we don’t yet know is what we spend it on,” Margulies said.
Margulies said the reform—supported by University President Drew G. Faust and “personally sponsored” by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp, and Provost Steven E. Hyman—aims to create a more centralized IT system across the University.
Prior to the initiative, the sub-cultures of different IT teams hindered smooth collaboration.
“This is not unique to IT service. [It is] driven by Harvard’s extreme decentralization,” Margulies said.
Currently, the University has about 30 separate e-mail systems, 10 student information management systems, and thousands of disparate websites, according to Margulies.
Another main goal of the reform is to provide better IT service to both faculty and students.
Currently, insufficient IT support for faculty and the uneven quality of support across different schools frustrate some faculty members.
“[Harvard’s] IT services are so haphazard and piecemeal that I gave up and hired my own,” read a quote from an anonymous faculty member presented on a PowerPoint presentation at the meeting.
If successfully implemented, however, the reform—led by a six member steering committee—will have far-reaching effects that are beyond the IT structures.
“A successful IT transformation will pave the way for other strategic structural change,” FAS Dean of Administration and Finance Leslie A. Kirwan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a faltering economy, the United Kingdom will not turn its back on the United States and other allies as it seeks to continue to serve as a major global power, said British Ambassador to the U.S. Nigel E. Sheinwald during his speech at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs yesterday.
After speaking about the current fragility of the European economy, Sheinwald turned to Britain’s plan of action for coping with the “difficult economic backdrop” in Europe. He focused on investment in key infrastructure projects, refocusing the government on vital areas and forging a new model of sustainable growth.
While the U.K. intends to contribute to and participate in globalization, Sheinwald said that the country will have to align itself with the 21st century world by modernizing defense and cyber capabilities, building up Special Forces and intelligence operations, and cooperating more closely with allies, including the U.S.
“The global landscape has changed dramatically,” Sheinwald said. “The international environment and the set of challenges that face us are more complex.”
The event, entitled “UK Foreign and Security Policy in an Age of Austerity,” was part of the ongoing Future of Diplomacy Project at the Institute of Politics. Kennedy School Professor R. Nicholas Burns moderated the discussion.
The Future of Diplomacy Project officially launched last November as a way to introduce speakers and discussions related to the role of diplomacy in a rapidly changing world, said Cathryn A. Clüver, the executive director of the project.
“For us, we wanted to look at the major shifts European economies are facing, because they no longer can borrow as much as they used to, and what that means for general global commitments,” Clüver said of the decision to have Sheinwald speak.
After living in England for 10 years, Anthony P. Morris, a member of the Kennedy School Dean’s Council, said he was very curious to hear Sheinwald’s perspective. Although Morris said that Sheinwald shed a positive light on a difficult set of circumstances, Morris added that he doesn’t think the U.K. initiatives will work quite as well as Sheinwald optimistically expressed.
Jonathan J. N. Edwards, a first-year graduate student, said the speech made him feel proud to not only be British, but also to study at an American university.
“What I primarily took away was the strength of the UK and U.S. relationship and the role the plays today,” Edwards said.
Sheinwald concluded the speech by reiterating that “austerity is a phase, not a current condition” and that the U.K. plans to maintain its global role.
“Britain will remain America’s most capable ally, rather leaner and tauter and conscious of the need to put our economy first,” Sheinwald said, “but still with the impressive global network and a will to act to advance our shared goals.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the end of this school year, one of Kirkland House’s guest rooms will become environmentally sustainable, according to Rebecca J. Cohen ’12 and Belen Rodriguez Galvez ’12, the student organizers behind the tentatively named Harvard Sustainable Dorm Project.
The initiative will permanently transform one of Kirkland’s visitor rooms—vacant dorm rooms which are used to house important visitors and official House guests throughout the year—into an environmentally-friendly space that utilizes cutting-edge sustainability innovations.
The project will involve physically outfitting the room in a sustainable manner, such as by using eco-friendly furniture or by installing lights activated by motion sensors. In addition, Cohen said she hopes that the project will be allowed to renovate the actual structure of the dorm room, although she said that she has not yet spoken to House Masters about the possibility of such drastic alterations.
The initiative is the brainchild of Kirkland sustainability tutor Alexios N. Monopolis. With the help of Cohen, Galvez, and several other students, he wrote a proposal for a sustainable dorm room and applied to a grant program offered by the Office for Sustainability. His idea was chosen as one of 14 grant recipients and received $3,000.
“Nobody’s really attacked the dorm room issue before through a sustainability grant,” said Elaine Strunk, sustainability engagement manager. “I think it will be a great example for future dorm projects.”
The grant requires that the project be completed by Apr. 27. When the room is not occupied by guests, members of the Harvard community will be welcome to tour the room, which Monopolis said he hopes will bring greater attention to sustainability issues on campus.
Only two people showed up to the Harvard Sustainable Dorm Project’s first meeting on Monday, but Cohen and Galvez said they expect that more people will join as the project progresses.
Among the ideas proposed at the meeting were floors that generate energy from people’s movement and meters that measure the total energy usage in the room.
Although everything brought up was purely speculative, Cohen and Galvez said that they expect that they will be able to incorporate a number of the innovative proposals into the eventual design of the room.
“Yes, this is a very big project,” Cohen said. But she pointed out that similar projects at other universities “have had very tangible effects on energy usage.”
As part of the grant, the student organizers are supposed to calculate the amount of energy that is saved by the eco-friendly renovations. This stipulation feeds into the Office for Sustainability’s goal of reducing Harvard’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2016.
Cohen and Galvez hope that their completed room will serve as an example of sustainable living in college dorms and that the administration will consider incorporating some of their innovations into renovated dorm rooms during the upcoming House renewal process.
Announced over two years ago, the House renewal project seeks to dramatically overhaul the internal structure of Harvard’s 12 residential Houses. In its 2009 Report on Harvard House Renewal, the House Program Planning Committee cited sustainability as one of its major goals.
Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson said that although she had not heard anything about the sustainability project, she expected that administrators would be interested in learning more about it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Today, February 9th, the sun set at 5:09pm. For most students, this symbolizes the end of those obnoxiously short winter days, but for the members of the women’s rowing team, late sunsets means racing. In this exclusive interview, The Full Court Press meets rowing co-captain Olivia “Liv” Coffey. The Leverett senior, who placed second at the 2009 World Championships, knows that nothing beats the moment when the Charles River melts and racing can start again. Except maybe Cedric Diggory and turtles. Every week The Full Court Press gives you the sort of personal scoop that you’re not likely to hear at a typical press conference.
Name: Liv Coffey
Year: 2011
Stats: Since freshman year, Coffey has been in the top varsity boat. An Olympic hopeful, the senior has raced with the U-23 National Team twice, finishing second in 2009 and winning in 2010. Prior to that, Coffey helped lead the team to second place at the EAWRC Sprints Championships and an NCAA Championships invitation.
Bring on the questions!
1. Typical pre-game meal:
If by pre-game you mean pre-race, then a cranberry nut muffin and a diet coke.
2. List four songs you listen to before races to get pumped up:
Stuntin' Like Mufasa, Teenage Dream (DJ Megaman Remix, of course), Tonight (I'm F... Loving You), and Club Can't Handle Me on max volume.
3. Favorite team to race against and why?
Princeton! The only thing they have going for them is their Tiger mascot.
4. Most ridiculous thing that has taken place in your team's locker room:
What happens in the Radcliffe locker room stays in the Radcliffe locker room.
5. Most embarrassing moment you've had rowing:
This January during our training trip in Sarasota, Fla., I made an extremely clever and equally inappropriate "that's what she said" joke while sliding some launches into the water. As soon as the words left my lips, I realized my coach was right next to me. I turned bright red and she just laughed. I'm sure, deep down, she appreciated my humor.
6. Animal that best represents your style of play and why:
A turtle. I like turtles.
7. Most ridiculous thing you have heard a fan yell at a race you were in:
It's rowing. Besides our parents, we don't have fans.
8. If you could play for another sports team at Harvard, which would it be and why?
At one point I would’ve said ice hockey, but now that I've invested so much in rowing, I'd probably go train with the lightweight men's team, only because I would probably have to lose a few appendages to make weight for the lightweight women's team.
9. Position you would play in Quidditch:
Cedric Diggory's broomstick.
10. If you could go on a date with any professional athlete, who would it be and where would you take him/her?
That's easy, Ray Allen. I would be too nervous to go on a one-on-one date with him. Instead, our date would consist of me watching a home game on the Celtic's bench and after each three he makes, he would point to me and mouth the words, "That was for you..."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL­, Mass.—The Harvard women’s hockey team has become accustomed to collecting wins in the Beanpot semifinals—in fact, it’s done so in the last four seasons. But no previous win was quite like this one.
After a furious comeback left the game tied after 65 minutes of play, the Crimson was in uncharted territory. For the first time in the career of everyone on the current Harvard roster, the game would be decided by a shootout.
And three Crimson sophomores ensured that their first foray into a sudden-death shootout would be a positive one.
Forward Jillian Dempsey led off with a goal, defenseman Josephine Pucci broke a 1-1 stalemate with a score in the fourth round, and goaltender Laura Bellamy sealed the win by stumping three of the four Northeastern shooters.
“We work on breakaways a couple times a week, so we had some good options,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “We knew that Dempsey was probably going to get the job done right off the bat. A lot of good choices, but to be honest, I was just really happy for Laura Bellamy, because she played that pressure situation with tremendous composure.”
The Crimson picked up the win over a team with much more shootout experience. The Huskies play in Hockey East, which used shootouts in regular-season games for the last two seasons, and Northeastern advanced to the Beanpot final last year with a shootout win of its own over Boston University.
“It’s a tough thing, but in a tournament like this, somebody’s going to be the winner or loser,” Huskies coach Dave Flint said. “We don’t want to be here until midnight trying to play a game and figure out who’s going to win.”
Although Harvard’s shootout win means it will advance to next week’s championship, the game will officially count as a tie in each team’s regular season record.
SAVED BY THE BELL
The 2010 Beanpot served as a first chance on a big stage for Bellamy, who had just assumed the starting job in net after then-senior Christina Kessler’s season was prematurely ended by injury.
Bellamy recorded a pair of clean sheets in that tournament, backstopping her team to a Beanpot championship and earning herself the Bertagna Award—given to the tournament’s best goaltender—in the process.
But less than 10 minutes into yersterday’s game, Bellamy’s scoreless Beanpot streak came to a screeching halt when the first of two quick Northeastern goals hit the back of the net.
By the midpoint of the second period, the Huskies boasted a 3-0 lead, and Bellamy’s quest for a second Bertagna title was in serious jeopardy.
Aided by her defense, which held Northeastern to just six shots in the last 45 minutes of the game, Bellamy did enough to keep her team in the game—and when the pressure was on in the sudden-death shootout, she delivered.
“They call goalies weird for a reason—I mean, I loved it,” Bellamy said after the game. “When the buzzer went off in overtime, I was very excited. I felt like I owed my team something for the comeback they had.”
WE’RE GOING TO THE ‘SHIP
Harvard’s six seniors have never experienced anything but Beanpot championship games, and last night’s shootout win ensures that they will end their careers with at least another runner-up finish.
The Crimson has won two out of the last three titles, topping the Huskies, 1-0, in last year’s final., and will have the chance to defend next week against Boston College.
“The Beanpot means a tremendous amount to those of us over at Harvard,” Stone said, “and it would have been very disappointing had we not made it to the final.”
That pride contributed to the Crimson’s sense of urgency as it scored twice in the game’s final five minutes to force overtime.
“In the locker room, definitely after the second period, you just look around at the seniors, and you just want [it] so bad,” senior Ashley Wheeler said. “We’re playing for every single person on that team...but definitely as a senior class, we really wanted this one.”
Harvard’s seniors did their part in regulation, playing a part in each of the team’s three goals, before the sophomores took care of business in the shootout.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Any athlete will tell you that it takes a lot to compete at a varsity level in a Division I program, beyond the obvious time commitment that practice, weight-lifting, and conditioning require. A Harvard athlete also has the unique and rigorous responsibility of balancing athletics and academics, not to mention the wide array of extracurricular and social opportunities the university has to offer.
That sounds like enough.
But imagine being a dual-sport athlete—double the commitment, double the time, double the practice, and double the pressure. Most would never give the idea any thought.
But junior Anne Carroll “AC” Ingersoll, a member of the Crimson women’s volleyball team, cannot count herself among the daunted after taking on the challenge of one of Harvard’s oldest, most demanding, and most celebrated sports: heavyweight crew.
Combining water and court, boat and net, the California native is proving how versatile a Harvard student and athlete can be.
“Being in season once a semester just wasn’t enough,” the junior said, laughing. “There’s something that I get out of athletics...that I just don’t get anywhere else...I was ready to learn a new skill.”
Ingersoll’s cousin, Jennie Peterson ’10, walked on to the heavyweight crew team as a freshman and rowed all four years for the Crimson.
“[Jennie] always raved about her experience on the crew team,” Ingersoll said. “She has been working on me since the day I found out I got into Harvard.”
Peterson’s pressure finally paid off, and Ingersoll went to Florida as a part of crew’s annual trip to begin her formal training.
“During the time we spent in Florida, [Ingersoll] immersed herself immediately into what we were doing and how we are trying to row,” Harvard coach Liz O’Leary said. “She was outstanding.”
Unlike other walk-ons, Ingersoll comes ready-made with the seasoned experience and leadership of a varsity athlete, serving as team captain in the most recent of her three years on the volleyball team.
“Anytime that an upperclassmen, even with a little experience, joins our program, they bring maturity,” O’Leary said. “AC certainly brings that level of maturity...but she’s also very humble about the fact that she isn’t nearly as experienced as everyone around her. She can laugh at her mistakes and...is just very coachable.”
But one aspect of the sport that the 6’2” junior does not need to be taught is one that is important throughout athletics: teamwork.
“After playing for so long, I know how to be on a team. I know what that means, and I know the kind of commitment that it takes,” Ingersoll said. “I think the ability to be on a team is not something that everyone knows, but I’ve been lucky enough to experience it, and to understand all the work that goes into it but also the rewards that come from it.”
“AC loves her teammates,” echoed newly elected volleyball captain, Sandra Lynne Fryhofer. “She makes even the most difficult situations light-hearted...and has a competitiveness that you can’t teach.”
Ingersoll, along with Fryhofer, was named to the Academic All-Ivy League team earlier this year, proving again that she can handle the pressure both on the court and in the classroom.
The attitude allowed AC to garner early success in volleyball, earning Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors her freshman year. For Ingersoll, it just comes down to work ethic, another critical characteristic in both of her sports.
“It’s fun to be successful and to make progress in such a tangible way, as in athletics,” Ingersoll said.
Despite the differences between the two sports, Ingersoll, her coaches, and her teammates are confident that the skills earned in each will complement each other in their respective seasons.
“This is going to be difficult—both physically and emotionally—but I think [AC] will have a great experience and develop as an athlete,” Fryhofer said. “I think the mental and physical endurance she will gain in crew will tranfer well onto the volleyball court.”
“I’ve been doing things on the crew team that I didn’t think that I could do,” Ingersoll added. “I never thought I’d be able to do an [erg test], to even get through it. But just to be out of my comfort zone...and still give it my best is something that I think will be really helpful with volleyball.”
Whether or not the junior finds the same success on the water that she has on the court, she has proven that only a select few can take the risk of balancing the grueling lifestyle of varsity athletics and an Ivy League education.
Her crew coach summed her up perfectly: “She’s a rare breed.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
CHESTNUT HILL, Mass.—After falling behind 3-0 in the semifinal game of the 33rd annual Beanpot, the No. 10 Harvard women’s hockey team (13-8-3, 12-4-2 ECAC) battled its way to a third-period comeback with back-to-back goals, forcing overtime in its match against Northeastern (14-9-6, 6-7-4 Hockey East).
Crimson sophomores Jillian Dempsey and Josephine Pucci each scored a goal in the sudden-death shootout, while classmate and goaltender Laura Bellamy’s tough stand in the net lifted Harvard to a 4-3 victory at Conte Forum last night.
The Crimson got off to a rocky start in the first period, as the Huskies scored first with a goal at the 9:30 mark from Rachel Llanes, who was assisted by teammates Alyssa Wohlfeiler and Maggie DiMasi. Northeastern continued its strong attack, striking again two minutes later. Casey Pickett capitalized on a breakaway to push the score to 2-0.
Harvard coach Katey Stone cited the Crimson’s failure to execute as the reason for the slow start.
“It was less about the score and more about our play, and the efficiency with the way we were trying to do things,” she said.
Aside from two penalties by the Huskies and a strong power-play effort by Dempsey and freshman Lyndsey Fry, Harvard had little to celebrate about in the first period, as Northeastern out-shot the Crimson by a 12-9 count.
Beginning the second period with strong shots on goal by tri-captain Liza Ryabkina and Fry, Harvard came out of the locker room looking aggressive and revived. But the Crimson squandered two scoring opportunities, as Pucci was tripped on a breakaway and Ryabkina failed to convert on an on-target pass from Dempsey.
Just as Harvard was showing its teeth, the Huskies’ Lori Antflick, assisted by Siena Falino and Stephanie Gavronsky, tallied her sixth goal of the season early in the period.
The goal was Northeastern’s only shot in the entire second frame.
Following the Huskies’ third goal, hope seemed to be dwindling for Harvard. But at the 12:30 mark of the second period, tri-captain Kate Buesser finally found the back of the net off an assist from freshman Gina McDonald. The Crimson ended the period with strong passing and solid defense by Pucci and freshman Marissa Gedman, and Harvard got off nine shots on goal.
“It’s tough to out-shoot a team and then not get any in the net, but I think we realized that we could run all over [the Huskies],” senior Ashley Wheeler said. “At the beginning of the third period, we weren’t getting goals. We were just getting more shots, more shots, building up. But I think that kind of just gave us more momentum.”
Wheeler capitalized on that momentum late in the period, sparking the Crimson comeback with a key goal. Dempsey found the senior breaking for the net, and Wheeler lifted the puck over Northeastern goalie Leah Sulyma’s head with 4:14 to play.
But Wheeler was not finished. Less than a minute later, the senior found Gedman, who powered a strike into the net from the blue line, forcing the Huskies to call a timeout with a little over three minutes on the clock.
“[As for] the pucks that the goalie had a hard time seeing, she either barely made a save or the pucks went in,” Stone said. “Two shots, two screens, two goals.”
Harvard ended the third period with 12 shots to Northeastern’s five.
“I think our team especially is a third-period team,” Wheeler said. “That’s a big thing about Harvard hockey—we’ll play until the last buzzer.”
The Crimson had little trouble holding the Huskies scoreless in the five-minute overtime period, but Harvard failed to convert any of its five shots into goals.
The 3-3 score held up, and the contest went to a charged best-of-three shootout.
Right out of the gate, Dempsey planted the puck in the net for the Crimson, while the following two shooters for both squads failed to capitalize on their on-goal attempts due to the stiff defense provided by Bellamy and Sulyma in goal.
Just when things looked bright for the Crimson, Northeastern captain Alyssa Wohlfeiler found the goal for the Huskies, giving each team a shootout goal.
The game went to a sudden death round of sudden-death, and put what proved to be the winning shot in the net to lift Harvard over Northeastern.
Bellamy sealed it with a stop against the last Husky shooter.
“I just jumped on the ice just like any other shot,” Pucci said of her game-winner. “You know, we’ve been in so many pressure situations, so it’s just go out there and shoot.”
Following its win in the semifinal game, Harvard will go on to play No. 7 Boston College in the Beanpot championship next Tuesday.

The Office of Career Services will be hosting two events focused on start-up organizations this week, offering students the opportunity to explore careers in entrepreneurship.
On Feb. 10 from 4:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. the Office of Career Services will be hosting an event during which alumni who have gone on to careers in start-up companies—including Stephanie M. Kaplan '10 (HerCampus.com), Kirsten E. Kester '09 (Generation Health, Inc.), and  Mark D. Lurie '07 (Abroad101.com)—will discuss their experiences, according to the OCS website. To pre-register, e-mail ocsrsvp@fas.harvard.edu with "Startup" in the subject line.
"A lot of students have been pursing the idea of being their own boss and how well they can work in a start-up," said Deb Carroll, Director of the OCS On-Campus Interview and Employer Relations Office. "Even if they are not the idea generator themselves, there's lots of interesting work to be done."
On Feb. 11, apply your new knowledge at the OCS' first Start-Up Career Fair from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Radcliffe Gym where representatives from approximately 40 start-up organizations will be promoting job and internship opportunities.
"It's a little bit of an experiment," Carroll said, "but we had such strong responses from the organizations and we know students are so interested in this area. It’s been brewing on campus for quite awhile."
