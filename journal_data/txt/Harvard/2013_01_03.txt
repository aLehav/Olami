After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: January 5, 2013, at 10:37 a.m.
Over the past nearly four decades, there have been few constants in the Winthrop House community. David D. Simms Jr., Winthrop’s superintendent and building manager for 38 years, was one of them.
Simms, who held the post since October 1974, died at Mount Auburn Hospital on Dec. 28 after suddenly falling ill in his office the week before. He was 65.
An email thread over the House list that began after the House Masters announced that he had been hospitalized tells story after story about how “Mr. Simms”—as he was known to the House community—had affected many members of the House in different ways. Usually, it was the small things they remembered—the times he gladly gave them a spare key when they were locked out of their rooms or went to great lengths to ensure that incoming mail packages efficiently reached their owners.
Undergraduates who had built personal relationships with Simms or worked with him remembered Simms as someone who, without fail, cared deeply about each student who passed through Winthrop House.
“He wanted to make sure that there wasn’t a student who came to the office and couldn’t get what they needed there,” said Alexis C. Gomez ’13, a Winthrop resident and Dorm Crew head captain who had worked closely with Simms.
Sitting in his office on the first floor of G-entryway with his door open, Simms would greet each person who walked past with an unmistakably warm “How you doin’?” He would then strike up a conversation and listen to students talk about their successes and struggles.
“You’re in the middle of exams. It’s winter. It’s cold. It’s dark. He’d make a joke—something about the news—he’d crack a joke, and you’d laugh,” said Jonathan M. Padilla ’12, a former Winthrop House resident who would frequently stop by Simms’s office to discuss politics and current events. “We needed the two to three minutes of humor a day to keep us sane.”
Sometimes, Simms would share his own stories as well—stories about Texas, where he went every summer to visit his extended family and indulge in warm weather and Southern barbecue. He told students that before coming to Harvard, he was a veteran of the U.S. Army who had served a tour in Vietnam, and that on the weekends he worked a second job as a guard for Eastern Security at the Longy School of Music of Bard College.
“He loved every one of those students,” said Mary A. Simms, Simms’s wife. She recalled that her husband would come home every day and talk about his work. “No two days were the same because it was always an adventure. Something always happened.”
For Winthrop students, Simms was the man to turn to when that something happened amid the hustle and bustle of academic and residential life. When the radiator stopped working or the roof started to leak, Simms would call for backup immediately. When a package arrived from home, Simms already had the student’s mailbox number memorized. When students forgot to put their boxes into storage in the spring or needed help removing them in the fall, Simms was there.
“He worked all of his time, and he never really asked for anything for himself,” said Zachary H. Goldberg ’14, who worked for Simms as a building manager assistant.
Raul A. Campillo ’09, a Winthrop resident tutor who also lived in the House and worked for Simms as an undergraduate, put it another way.
“He really understood that Winthrop House was everyone’s home away from home,” Campillo said. “He was synonymous with the House.”
Mary Simms said that in recent years, she would ask her husband when he would finally leave Harvard. Each time, Simms would say that “next year” he would retire and return to Texas, but “next year” never seemed to come. Even in the few months before he died, Simms repeatedly told her that 2013 would be the year.
“He was one of the longest serving building managers at Harvard—someone who clearly wasn’t doing it because he made fantastic money or because he wanted it to be some platform to some other position,” said Alexander G. Smith ’15, the current Dorm Crew captain of Winthrop House. “He really genuinely enjoyed the company of the students in Winthrop and was someone who, at the end of the day, cared about the well-being of the students.”
A funeral will be held on Friday morning at the Mount Olive Kingdom Builders Worship Center in Boston. Visitation begins at 10 a.m., and the service begins at 11 a.m.
Simms is survived by his wife Mary, his daughters Charlyne and Michele, his son David D. Simms III, and his grandchildren David D. Simms IV, Mickai D. L. Simms, and Lia A. Monteiro.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Congressional lawmakers reached an eleventh-hour deal late Tuesday to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, largely postponing what will likely be far-reaching spending cuts expected to cost Harvard and other research universities millions of dollars in federal sponsorship.
 
The bill allows the top marginal tax rate to rise to 39.6 percent on individuals earning at least $400,000 and families earning more than $450,000, but avoids universal tax increases as well as automatic, across-the-board spending cuts that would have taken effect Wednesday had the legislation not passed. Such cuts would have slashed billions from the federal budget in the coming year alone and left a large hole in Harvard’s balance sheets.
 
Temporarily postponed but still looming is sequestration, which would result in automatic, across-the-board reductions in spending of 8.2 percent for nondefense programs and 9.4 percent for defense programs. Those cuts include millions of dollars in research funding earmarked for Harvard and other institutions for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, 2012. 
 
Last fiscal year, the University received around $650 million in federal sponsorship—a figure which accounted for about 16 percent of Harvard’s entire operating budget, according to the Office for Sponsored Programs 2012 annual report.
 
The postponement of sequestration means that Congress now has until March 1 to reach a broader spending deal to avert the automatic cuts. Such a deal would likely be part of a larger federal debate over the debt ceiling by the new Congress, which is set to be sworn in Thursday.
 
Harvard, which actively lobbies in Washington, will likely continue its efforts to preserve research funding in any future deal. The University did not return requests for comment on Tuesday's deal. University President Drew G. Faust has said in the past that Harvard might look to private sponsorship to help fill any gap that may emerge from a decrease in federal funding.
 
While Tuesday’s deal largely dealt with questions of federal revenue, the final bill does call for some discretionary cuts to be split between defense and nondefense programs. Whether or not those initial cuts will affect research funding is uncertain. Harvard receives significant funding from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Defense, among other programs.
 
Less than an hour after the House of Representatives passed the measure, President Barack Obama spoke from the White House, thanking Congressional leaders and Vice President Joe Biden for their work on the agreement. He also looked ahead to the looming debt battles, warning that the country must take a balanced approach to further spending cuts as it seeks to avoid hitting the debt ceiling in the future.
 
 
“We can’t simply cut our way to prosperity,” Obama said Tuesday night. “We can’t keep cutting things like basic research and new technology and still expect to succeed in a 21st-century economy.”

The Harvard men’s basketball team would like nothing more than to leave 2012 in the past. After losing on a last-second game-winner against Saint Mary’s on New Years Eve, the Crimson will look to make a fresh start in 2013 when it hosts Rice on Saturday.
Co-captain Christian Webster is the only Harvard player remaining from the last time the Crimson (7-5) took on the Owls (3-9) in 2009. The guard—then a freshman—dropped 10 points in an 85-64 blowout by a starting five that included Jeremy Lin ’10 and last season’s co-captains, Oliver McNally and Keith Wright.
After tinkering with Harvard’s starting lineup for the first six games of the season, coach Tommy Amaker has settled on a starting five which is led by freshman point guard Siyani Chambers and sophomore forward Wes Saunders. Chambers and Saunders, who have started every game this season, top the team with 12.5 and 15.8 points per game, respectively.
Saunders has scored in the double digits every game this season, and he credits Chambers—who averages 5.7 assists per game—for creating offensive opportunities.
“Siyani had confidence in me even in the first half when I wasn’t knocking down shots,” said Saunders, following an 18-point performance in last week’s upset victory over California. “He kept coming to me, and so I was able to knock down some shots, and my teammates put me in the right position.”
Joining Chambers and Saunders in the starting lineup are Webster, junior guard Laurent Rivard, and sophomore Forward Jonah Travis.
“That’s been our best lineup,” said Amaker after the Cal game. “We’ve stuck with that now for a few games, and I like the rhythm it’s given our team. We space the floor well, and when we get some post production that really adds to the balance of our team.”
After failing to score in double digits in the previous four games, Travis was dominant in the paint against Saint Mary’s, putting up a season-high 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting from the field.
In addition to creating opportunities on offense, defense will be crucial as the Crimson takes on an Owls team led by senior Tamir Jackson. The guard—who is the only Rice player returning from the 2009 matchup—averages 17.6 points per game with 6.7 rebounds. Following Jackson is sophomore guard Julian DeBose, who adds 9.5 points per game.
While the Owls’ two top scorers are starters, the team has also been able to take advantage of a strong bench. Three bench players are averaging more than five points per game, led by Junior guard Austin Ramljak with 7.7.
In twelve games, the Owls have been outmatched offensively across the board. They are shooting 39 percent from the field to Harvard’s 46.3 and averaging 57.9 points per game to the Crimson’s 68.3.
Despite the statistical mismatch, Harvard will have to contain Jackson in order to shut down the Owl’s offense. In the matchup against Cal, Amaker looked to Saunders to defend the Bears’ top scorer, junior guard Allen Crabbe. Saunders credits his teammates with helping slow his opponent down.
“Obviously I knew [Crabbe] was going to make some tough shots,” Saunders said. “But I mean it was just a team effort defending him. My teammates had my back whenever I got caught.”
In turning the page in the New Year, Harvard will look to cut down on costly mistakes that sealed its fate against Saint Mary’s. The Crimson led until the last second, but a couple of missed rebounds and shots from the stripe made the difference down the stretch as the Gaels chipped away at Harvard’s lead through the second half.
“We made too many critical mistakes with handling the basketball and not making foul shots… which is what wins you close games, especially when you’re up,” Amaker said after the loss.
“The intensity that we brought in the first half just wasn’t there in the second half, and I don’t know what it was,” Travis added. “I think we might have just gotten too comfortable.”
The Owls enter the contest having lost their last two against TCU and Texas. Rice has yet to put together back-to-back victories this season.
A win against the Owls would put the Crimson back on track after snapping its three game win streak—the longest of the season—to end its California road trip. The matchup is Harvard’s last non-conference game before the start of Ivy League play when Harvard travels to take on Dartmouth on Jan. 12.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a back-and-forth first quarter that ended with the Hornets up by one, the basement-dwellers of the Western Conference looked to steal one on the road from Jeremy Lin ’10 and the Houston Rockets. But a 25-foot jumper from Lin in the very next frame capped off a 12-5 Rockets run that saw the final lead change of the game.
Lin recorded nine points and seven assists as the Houston Rockets took their second straight in a 104-92 win over the New Orleans Hornets Wednesday night.
Although New Orleans (7-25) briefly tied the game midway through the fourth quarter, Houston (18-14) never fell behind after taking the lead in the second. The Rockets finished strong, outscoring the Hornets in each of the final two periods to hand New Orleans its 13th road loss of the season in 16 away games.
Houston’s James Harden led all scorers with 31 points for his 11th 30-plus point performance of the season. Teammate Omer Asik put down 21 points of his own while rookie Patrick Patterson added 15 points off the bench.
Lin logged a game-high 42 minutes and shot 3-for-10 from the field.
“I’m feeling good,” Lin said after his fourth straight 40-plus-minute game. “Tonight was a tougher one. Shots weren’t falling, so it was an uglier one.”
As the regular season nears its midway point, Houston clings to the sixth spot in the Western Conference. Two games separate the Rockets from the ninth-place Minnesota Timberwolves in a tightening playoff picture.

Former Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren took the oath of office at noon Thursday, becoming the first woman to ever serve Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate.
She, along with seven other Democrats, three Republicans, and one independent, is part of the 12-member freshmen class joining the 113th Congress as it convenes for the first time Thursday. Democrats will maintain a majority in the Senate as the battle over federal debt continues in the coming months.
Warren defeated U.S. Senator Scott Brown last November in what was one of the most closely-watched Senate races in the country. She comes to Washington after a long career in academia, where she rose through the ranks to become a leading expert on consumer finance law and one of the most popular professors at the Law School.
The intellectual force behind the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Warren is not new to Washington. Though she arrives in the capitol with baggage heavier than many of her fellow freshmen in the Senate, Warren has already parleyed her high profile into a key appointment to the Senate Banking Committee.
She takes the seat of Brown, a Republican who served in Washington for two years after replacing longtime Senator Edward M. Kennedy '54-'56 in 2010. Brown is expected to announce his candidacy to fill the seat of fellow Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry, who will leave the Senate if confirmed as Secretary of State.
Democratic Congressman Edward J. Markey, who represents the majority of Harvard's Cambridge-based campus, has already announced his own bid for the seat. If Kerry is confirmed, the state could see a special election as soon as June.
