After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I walk into aquariums and think of Julio Cortázar’s “Axolotl.” The story’s eerily matter-of-fact narrator observes the axolotl, Mexican salamanders, in reverent and apprehensive detail. He imagines them “aware, slaves of their bodies condemned infinitely to the silence of the abyss, to a hopeless meditation.” His consciousness draws excruciatingly close to the axolotl’s—until his mind presses through the pane of reality, and his body passes through the aquarium glass. He is the axolotl, trapped in the tank, watching his human face outside.
Shedd Aquarium’s axolotl tank is mercifully empty when I visit. Next door, a pig-snouted turtle lies at a 45-degree angle, the water around it stagnant and green like the street pall in Hopper’s “Nighthawks.” I stand, waiting for it to move and restore itself to some semblance of autonomy. It floats, waiting for me to realize better and leave. A disembodied voice tells the legend of the Amazon’s river dolphins, “boto,” who transform into beautiful men and seduce the “ribereños’” women.
Before his transformation, Cortázar’s narrator muses: “It would seem easy, almost obvious, to fall into mythology.” And the narrative of human and animal as “one”—both in genetic parity and some empathy with even grotesquely foreign-looking creatures—seems to have weakened with use and industrialization. We overfish and poach and pollute. The axolotl, at the end of the story, laments accordingly: “…the bridges were broken between him and me…I am an axolotl for good now, and if I think like a man it’s only because every axolotl thinks like a man inside his rosy stone semblance.”
But that last sentence contradicts itself: If the axolotl thinks like a man, and man’s thought is his defining mark, the entanglement remains unresolved. Cortázar implies that man and axolotl share their doom, the “final solitude” behind the glass.
A stingray surges silken and calm beneath my palm, only to suddenly spurn me with the twitch of a fin. I resent it. After its neighbor glides up to nip at my hand, I want to set a salted fingertip on my own tongue. Tangled lampreys suction their mouths to their tank, baring concentric rings of angled teeth. I find my face tensing, prepared to swing my jaws open too. The motion promises to be soothing, somehow, bloodless as the opening of a window.
I swim along the aquarium tunnels with schools of people as varied as the fish on display: toddler cheeks and Yakuza arms, football jerseys and saris, all in respectful observance before the tanks. The axolotl forces me to press my nose to the tenuous glass of human consciousness. We blink at our own visages, distorted just enough to be new again, and wonder what we are really about. Idle, carnal, facetious, parasitic. Wonder whether we are here or there, outside or in, warden or prisoner; wonder, as Cortázar did—and perhaps this is the key to all the “oneness”—whether, in the end, the distinction really matters or exists at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While walking next to the ocean, one is supposed to reflect on a few trite yet apt platitudes: among others, the feeling of human minuteness in comparison to the vastness of the ocean, the metronomic ebb and flow that is a constant reminder of the inexorable passage of time, the soothing and almost entrancing sound of its waves crashing upon the shore.
As I strolled on the shore of Shackleford Banks, a remote barrier island off the coast of North Carolina, I felt painfully susceptible to these clichés. Nevertheless, I prioritized being blasé over succumbing to such sentimentality; I wanted to find a way to have a non-cliché walk on the beach.
I spent a while skipping shells, which was somewhat challenging. I first had to find a shell with relatively little curvature, wait for the calm between the peaks of two waves, and then sidearm it, convex side down and with clockwise spin, almost parallel to the surface of the water. Initially I threw the shells straight out into the surf, so that many of my stronger throws were prematurely cut off by the crests of incoming waves. I briefly remedied this problem by throwing the shells parallel instead of perpendicular to the shore, but found it less satisfying, so I began to throw shells directly into the surf again, come what may.
After the relatively static activity of skipping shells, I alternated wading in the water, which sprayed water onto my shins, and walking in the drier sand above the high tide line, allowing the water to dry. The evaporating water deposited salt crystals on my legs, which I sampled by wetting my index finger with the tip of my tongue, touching one of my legs, and then licking the salt crystals off my finger. I can affirm they tasted like sea rather than normal salt.
In a similar fashion, I dabbed my right index finger in the beach’s moderately fine sand in order to collect a layer of individual grains of sand on its surface. Instead of tasting the sand, I then held it up as closely as possible to my face, closing my left eye and squinting with my right. It was evident under such scrutiny that sand is not homogenous, but instead is made of disparate and multicolored shells pulverized over time by waves. This fact was borne out by the areas of coarse shell fragments, perhaps half a centimeter in diameter, that I occasionally strolled over. I found it uncomfortable to reflect on how much time it would take this sand in the making to become actual sand.
I eventually sat, and stared out at the ocean, feeling small and hypnotized by its rhythmic motion, for a period of time I lost track of. Perhaps, I thought to myself, sentimentality isn’t such a bad thing after all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tears and embraces rippled through a crowd of more than 200 Harvard affiliates who gathered at the steps of Memorial Church early Tuesday evening to commemorate the victims of a brutal attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando.
Forty-nine people were killed by a lone gunman at the nightclub Pulse early Sunday morning, marking the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. The vigil at Harvard was somber as those in attendance reflected on the tragedy, and many people called on others to respond to the attack with action, not passivity.
University President Drew G. Faust, speaking at the beginning of the vigil, called the crime “brutal and senseless”  and urged the crowd not to “lose sight of the common humanity” in the face of the inhumane.
But while Faust elected for a more muted tone in her remarks, asking Harvard affiliates to address the tragedy through a show of community, some speakers expressed anger and anguish.
 Eden H. Girma ’18 took to the podium to deliver a performance of “Ella’s Song,” encouraging the crowd to join in on the song’s refrain, “We who believe in freedom cannot rest until it comes.”  The crowd was at first hesitant to sing, but did so more loudly by the third chorus.
History and Literature lecturer Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 said he wanted to find ways to actively address the tragedy.
“I want to figure out how best to speak up, step up, to act up,” McCarthy said.
Jonathan L. Walton, the Pusey Minister of Memorial Church, took the stage last and condemned passivity.
“I want us to be clear about something,” Walton said. “Our purpose here is not a passive one.”
He invited the people gathered at the vigil to fill out multicolored index cards with pledges of the action they would take against incidents like Sunday’s shooting, and to line the steps of Memorial Church with the cards.
In his remarks, Walton slammed the National Rifle Association for what he described as “John Wayne fantasies and insecure masculinities.”
“We will not accept a new norm of one nation under a gun,” Walton said.
University leaders also took to email and social media in the wake of the tragedy to express their sadness over the shooting in Orlando and reach out to students who may have been affected.
On Monday, Faust released a statement on Twitter offering sympathy to the families affected by the shooting and encouraged followers to read a New York Times article written Harvard fellow, Jim Downs, about the previous largest massacre of gay people that occurred in New Orleans in 1973.
Faculty Deans also sent emails over House lists, reminding students of the campus resources available to for emotional support. The Office of BGLTQ Student Life released a statement expressing support for BGLTQ people of color, noting that the shooting “specifically targeted Latinx BGLTQ people at an event highlighting trans Latinx performers.”
While much of the national public discourse around Sunday’s events has focused on terrorism and gun violence, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana sought to recenter the discussion on how the tragedy affected the BGLTQ community. In an email to College affiliates Monday, Khurana encouraged students to consider adding hashtags of support in the wake of the tragedy to their online posts.
At the vigil, Khurana joined four other students at the podium to read out the names of the 49 victims of the shooting, many of whom were in their twenties. A long moment of silence followed the tally.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The two aces of the Harvard baseball team’s pitching staff were both selected in last week’s Major League Baseball Draft. Sean Poppen ’16 and rising senior Nick Gruener '17, key cogs for the most successful Crimson team in coach Bill Decker’s tenure, combined for eight victories, 96 strikeouts, and a 2.91 earned run average in 18 starts this season.
Poppen was taken by the Minnesota Twins in the 19th round while his teammate was taken by the Baltimore Orioles three rounds later. Poppen, a chemistry and physics double major from Winthrop House, finished his collegiate career with 211 and a third innings pitched and made at least eight starts in each of his four seasons in Cambridge. He was the seventh college pitcher selected by the Twins and was the third Ivy League player taken in the draft, behind Dartmouth right-hander Duncan Robinson, who was taken by the Chicago Cubs in the ninth round, and Columbia second baseman Will Savage, a 16th round pick of the Detroit Tigers.
Gruener will have the opportunity to return to Harvard for his senior season. The Miami native was a second team All-Ivy selection as a junior, led the Crimson in strikeouts, wins, and innings pitched, and was the Ivy League’s leader in complete games, with seven. Gruener was the second Ancient Eight junior selected (behind only Savage) and was the third Ivy right-hander off the board.
Columbia, Dartmouth, and Harvard each had two players selected over the three-day draft. Robinson was joined by rotation mate Michael Danielak while the Lions’ duo consisted of Savage and right-hander George Thanopoulos. Brown lefty Austin French and Yale right-hander Chasen Ford rounded out the conference’s eight selections.
Harvard currently has four players in the minor leagues. Brent Suter ’12 and Frank Herrmann ’06 currently appear the closest to reaching The Show. A left-handed pitcher, Suter has spent the entire season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, the triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. Herrmann is a righty with the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, the triple-A farm team for the Philadelphia Phillies.
The Crimson’s two most recent draft picks prior to Poppen and Gruener, Tanner Anderson ’15 and Mike Martin ’15, are both playing at the single-A level. Anderson is a right-handed pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization while Martin is an outfielder in the Oakland A’s system. While it has been almost four years since a Harvard graduate (Herrmann) has thrown a pitch in a Major League game, Harvard baseball may be coming to a big league ballpark near you in the not too distant future.
Ivy League Players Selected in 2016 MLB Draft
Austin French- Brown LHP 27 (821)
Will Savage- Columbia 2B 16 (475) Jr.
George Thanopoulos- Columbia RHP 27 (800)
Duncan Robinson- Dartmouth RHP 9 (284)
Michael Danielak- Dartmouth RHP 28 (855) Jr.
