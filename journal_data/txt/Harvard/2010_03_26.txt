After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a year of political posturing and rancorous debate over healthcare, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law Tuesday, codifying reforms that will indelibly transform the insurance industry. This represents the most drastic form of federal action on domestic affairs since the institution of Medicare decades ago. While the partisan combat will likely continue, this moment belongs to the Democrats. In this victory that has eluded several administrations in the past, the passage of healthcare reform marks a monumental accomplishment for President Obama, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and the Democratic Party.
At a time when 46 million people lack health insurance and rising premiums outpace the growth in wages, healthcare required far-reaching reform. Left to the status quo, more and more Americans would lose coverage due to soaring costs, and system inefficiencies restricting the quality of care would engulf the industry. And with retiring Baby Boomers mounting additional stress on providers, the situation called for bold and decisive action. This legislation puts America on track to solve these pressing issues by insuring 32 million people and enacting consumer protections that will counter the host of problems plaguing the system.
Debate over the law’s cost, however, has yet to fade, despite the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office’s conclusion that it is fiscally responsible. In advancing their allegation that Democrats will add to the deficit, Republicans insist that the bill will cost Americans far more than the CBO report suggests. This claim is largely unfounded; in fact, the CBO regularly errs toward conservative estimates about cost savings because it fails to account for savings from intangible factors, such as better technology and systemic improvement. Considering these additional components, Harvard economist David Cutler estimates that the law may save hundreds of billions of dollars more than the CBO predicted over the next decade. Contrary to Republican claims, the law is indeed fiscally prudent and could actually close America’s widening budget gap over time.
In reality, although supporters hail this as an epic achievement, the final product is not ideal and the effort to reform a broken industry is far from over. Ultimately, millions of Americans will remain uninsured, a problem which deserves serious attention down the road. Also, while the new programs will bend the healthcare cost curve, it does not break it, and Congress must take further action to make insurance more affordable in the future.
However, in times like these, idealism must be tempered with political realism. Despite its imperfections, the bill represents the best possible product given the political climate of the time. With Mass. Senator Scott Brown’s game-changing election stripping Democrats of their supermajority in the Senate, party leaders acted wisely in compromising on secondary issues to achieve primary goals. For instance, although ideally the legislation would not include restrictions on federal funding for abortion, striking a deal proved necessary in order to gain the votes of pro-life Democrats, given the political circumstances.  Leaders like Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid should be commended for their shrewd congressional savvy in crafting the best possible bill considering the complex interests they had to accommodate.
Even with the stellar efforts of their party leaders, though, the victory would not be possible without the audacity of individual Democrats in the House and Senate. Healthcare was a bitterly divisive issue, and the American public trended toward opposition to the bill. Democrats in more conservative districts who voted for the law jeopardized their popularity and possibly even their jobs. It is rare in this era of campaign individualism for politicians to place principles before reelection, and those Democrats who accepted this risk deserve recognition. Considering this political gamble, constituents in favor of the new healthcare law should show appreciation to their representatives at the ballot box come Election Day. These leaders put their careers on the line for their values, which merits sincere commendation.
Meanwhile, amidst the muddling political circus in Congress, Obama and his administration showed tenacity in refusing to forfeit their vision for reform. Campaigning on the promise of fixing America’s unfair and unsustainable healthcare system, Obama put reform at the top of his political agenda and did not allow the debate to disappear from the public consciousness. As calls to throw out the bill and begin from scratch grew raucous upon Brown’s stunning election in January, Obama and his team increased their efforts by appealing directly to members of both parties and their constituents. The Obama administration’s resolve and clarity of purpose throughout this yearlong struggle made possible the enactment of broad reforms for the sake of the American people.
One immediate consequence of this achievement is that it will finally free Congress to work definitively to address other important issues. While healthcare was a critical problem that deserved the highest attention, myriad others also merit scrutiny and action. Specifically, Congress should now focus its efforts on reforming financial regulations and energy policy. As for now, Democrats on Capitol Hill can relish their historic triumph in a battle that was begun over a century ago. This legislation is a tremendous achievement for the Democrats in Congress and signifies a victory of the highest caliber for Obama’s young presidency.

CORRECTION: March 29, 2010  
 
An earlier version of the Mar. 26 staff editorial "How 'Bout Them Dems" stated that Harvard economist David Cutler estimates that the law may save hundreds of millions of dollars more than the CBO predicted over the next decade. In fact, Cutler predicted it will save hundreds of billions of dollars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A fact not surprising to anyone who has followed the healthcare reform battle in the last year is that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, now signed into law, managed to pass through both chambers of Congress without a single Republican voting “Yea.” In comparison, another landmark bill passed 75 years ago, the Social Security Act of 1935, passed the House 372 votes to 33, with 81 Republicans voting in support. Thirty years later in 1965, the Medicaid and Medicare amendments were added with a House margin of 307-to-116, with 70 Republicans voting in favor.
What is remarkable, however, is that when first proposed, healthcare reform would have in fact most benefitted the predominantly Republican states, where disparities in healthcare are the greatest as reported by UnitedHealth Foundation’s annual rankings. Of the 10 unhealthiest states in 2009, nine voted for John McCain in 2008. In 2004, all of the 15 worst ranking states backed George W. Bush.
But increasingly it seems that the needs of constituents have fallen on deaf ears to Washington leaders as party-line commitment now trumps the duty to hometown voters. Representation in Congress is no longer vested in pushing constituency interests, which are now being marginalized by national party politics. In fact, the ill-fated “Cornhusker Kickback” represents the rare hat tip to a congressman’s constituents in the last year. Kudos, Senator Ben Nelson, for trying.
Today, the party usurps all. Congressional campaigns are increasingly being conducted and synchronized by party leadership, with national figures frequently campaigning for local candidates. The special senatorial election in Massachusetts drew in the entire nation’s attention such that it almost made sense to enfranchise the country to vote. The election was foremost a matter of national importance, preserving the Senate majority, over what was truly at stake: electing a representative from Massachusetts.
This growing cephalization of legislative independence into the hands of a few party leaders is also evident in the growing reducibility of Election Day results to single-tally chamber majorities. Anemic third parties and the fixation on factionalized agendas have merely relegated elections to an oscillation between party majorities—the stifling polarization and “factions” that George Washington warned against in his farewell address. Even insiders, like retiring Ind. Senator Evan Bayh, contest the growing inefficiencies of rampant party-line voting, confirmed by the apex of legislative inefficiency in 2009.
The challenge we now face is a longer-term polarization of our political system into a confrontational boxing match, each party unrelenting when the other is in power. Recourse from the current route requisites systemic change; anything less will spiral to dystopic ends. As apart as the North and South seemed when the first shots were fired at Fort Sumter 150 years ago, party lines divide America today. The war we face comes with its costs of progress and efficiency, as each side fights to preserve its vision of America. The pivot of this “new secession” is not the Mason-Dixon, but a far shorter aisle separating the legislatures of America by way of our two-party system.
Abandoning party affiliations in our government and instead assessing issues point-by-point is the only solution to reviving the complexities and beauty of our pluralistic political system, shortchanged by the outlandish desire to paint the nation blue or red. Should we not abolish our two-party system with the utmost urgency, then it will instead threaten to destroy the faithful representation of the people and the unity of our republic. We cannot continue to gerrymander America into ideological boundaries—a distinct Democratic States of America and Republican Confederacy. That is the inevitable outcome of our current two-party system: “E pluribus duo”.
We must instead renew the hope of progress promised to a nation and repair the divisions that threaten its realization. This is our Civil War to fight and America’s two-party system, our “peculiar institution” to overcome.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You should be grateful. Next year, you will cost Harvard College $50724 in tuition, room, and board. Yet you will pay around $11500 if you receive financial aid, as most students do. Should you thank Dean Michael Smith for his magnanimity, however, you might wonder, “Why does the College charge so much?”
Answer: Because it can.
“One of the biggest drivers of college prices is aid,” Neal McCluskey, associate director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute, told me. “Government provides lots of aid to students so that they are not the ones paying these additional costs. Taxpayers are. Colleges are nonprofits, so they want to maximize revenue. The more aid you offer, the more they raise their prices to get that aid, because it doesn’t make students worse off.”
For evidence, McCluskey offered data from his chapter in the “Cato Handbook for Policymakers.” Between 1986 and 2006, the average cost in real dollars of higher education at private schools leapt from $18122 to $30497, or by 68 percent. If you subtract the average grant, loan, and tax credit that students received over this period, however, the cost jumped from $10943 to $14158, or by 29 percent. “The loans do not completely desensitize students to the costs they cover,” McCluskey wrote, “but with low interest rates and generous terms, they soften the blow.”
His argument, I should note, is controversial. “I believe it is very clear in absolute terms that people are paying more than they were ten or twenty years ago,” Kevin Carey, policy director of Education Sector, told me. Still, Carey thinks McCluskey has a point: “Econ 101 would say that if you subsidize a product, some of the subsidy will end up in the consumer’s pocket and some of it will end up in the producer’s. It doesn’t matter who you give it to.”
But Carey spied a different devil: nonprofit status. “Harvard doesn’t pay taxes even though it’s sitting on a gigantic pile of money,” he said. He suggested that the government force colleges to spend five percent of their endowments each year. “If you’re running the Gates foundation, you have to spend five percent of your assets every year. You can’t just sit on the money. If colleges spent just five percent of their assets, then they could take that extra money and use it to keep prices down.
Notice the word “could.” More likely, colleges would spend that money on other things, as per tradition. “The number of administrators per student has gone up but you can also see the facilities arms race,” McCluskey said. “Colleges are constantly building buildings or new dormitories.”
This arms race incriminates another suspect: accreditation. “Not anyone can be in the college business. You have to be accredited. There are pretty high barriers to entry both from a cost perspective and from a reputational perspective,” said Carey. The need for accreditation drives schools to make purchases—and to raise prices. For example, the University of Colorado Law School had to increase its tuition because the American Bar Association demanded that its library include things like electrical outlets for laptops and an instructional courtroom.
The problem, therefore, is that the market for higher education is rigged. Schools block cheaper competitors from entering, and government encourages prices to rise. True, these observations have less salience for private schools. You cannot change the fact that lots of people want to go to Harvard, and there is only one Harvard. Plenty of them can pay. Besides, federal aid, like Pell Grants, covers only a fraction of tuition; their inflationary effect is smaller on these schools.
But you can question the hand that feeds you, especially when it offers seconds. During his presidential campaign, President Barack Obama promised students $4000 tax credits to help pay tuition in exchange for 100 hours of community service. And this week, the House of Representatives voted to cut subsidies to private lenders who loan to students, so the government could lend to students directly. McCluskey feared that with the expected savings from this change, the government might increase Pell Grants. And if President Obama got his tax credit, the government could push tuition even higher.
So, as I said, you should be grateful—that our politicians have yet to fulfill their promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“You scan some Houses: Mather, Kirkland, Quincy. Nothing. The only signs of life are from solitary souls with loud tape-decks and pre-meds scurrying through the night for warm, secret places to study.” Sound familiar? This description of a Harvard weekend was written in 1985 and is only dated by its reference to tape-decks. While much has changed in Cambridge over the past 25 years, at least one thing—the paucity of parties—seems to have stayed the same.
In fact, complaining about student life is one of Harvard’s oldest traditions, going back to the Great Butter Rebellion of 1766, when students rioted to protest meal quality under the presidency of Edward Holyoke. Nowadays, undergrads are more docile, but it’s unclear that they have a more charitable view of the school’s social offerings. One survey found that Harvard ranks almost dead last among 31 peer institutions in student social life. And it doesn’t take data to convince anyone who’s seen the typical Cambridge Friday night or heard the litany of complaints that it inspires.
Every story needs a villain, and Harvard students typically identify a series of injustices that condemn them to lives of work and celibacy. First on anyone’s list is the oft-lamented “lack of social space,” perpetrated by the amorphous and sinister “administration.”
This complaint is understandable. In all sorts of ways, Harvard students get the short end of the social stick: The school has no properly functioning student center (with all due respect to Student Organization Center at Hilles); Cambridge maintains notoriously strict liquor laws; a staggering 97 percent of undergrads live on campus, ruling out apartment parties; the clubs that control a substantial portion of Harvard Square’s best real estate close their doors to most potential partiers. And over the past couple of years, that familiar bogeyman, “the administration,” has taken steps to crack down on drinking, ending the UC’s Party Fund, restricting liquor at Stein Clubs, and creating new liability for student group leaders when their events go awry.
Yet while the narrative of a student body hampered by limited resources and a fun-hating administration has a kernel of truth, it mischaracterizes the problem.
Harvard’s social resources may not be on par with its academic offerings, but they’re not as shabby as many assume either. For one thing, the physical plant doesn’t get enough credit. Everyone agrees that the lavish—albeit exclusive—mansions that line Mount Auburn Street have top-quality social space. But there is no room in any final club nicer than half of the house junior common rooms and dining halls that frequently host Stein Clubs and house committee-sponsored events. An honest assessment reveals that common space at Harvard is arguably better than at most other colleges.
Meanwhile, those bold enough to venture off campus will find that Harvard sits smack in the middle of the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Cambridge’s liquor policies may bear the stamp of the Puritans, but the city is no social wasteland.
Above all, it’s unclear that any administrator really deserves blame for the dearth of social options. Harvard could do more to let its students enjoy themselves, notably by changing its perverse student group liability policy and turning a blind eye to innocuous traditions like River Run and the Harvard/Yale Tailgate. But on a regular weekend, what exactly is the school failing to provide? The most common answer is some sort of large, flexible social space. Yet this complaint seems to ignore the Queen’s Head Pub, which is about to celebrate its three-year anniversary. University funds also subsidize Stein Clubs and larger weekly dining hall parties open to all.
This supply doesn’t silence demands, but that’s because there’s an unbridgeable gap between what students want and what the College can give them. The socializing that most undergrads envision involves underage drinking. In that regard, though, the administration has its hands tied by Massachusetts law. The drinking age is 21, and no one in University Hall is responsible for this. So while ID-checkers at the Queen’s Head may ruffle some feathers, Harvard cannot reasonably be expected to directly sponsor illegal activity. Following the termination of the Party Fund in 2007, Assistant Dean of the College Paul J. McLoughlin challenged students to locate “any other school in the country who gives alcohol to students,” adding “you won’t find it.” It’s a tough pill to swallow, but McLoughlin is right. Dean Hammonds doesn’t hand out 40s to freshmen, but neither does any other college administrator in America.
What really sets Harvard apart isn’t the place but the people. Our social life problem is, first and foremost, of our own design. Harvard students simply aren’t a very party-hardy bunch. When facing a decision between the Kong and a Chinese history midterm, we typically pick the latter, and that choice wouldn’t change even if a coup unseated Drew Faust and replaced her with Captain Morgan. For the sake of honesty, we should acknowledge that what really keeps us chained to our desks is not around us, but within us.

Harvard Medical School researchers have discovered that the organelles responsible for carbon fixation within cyanobacteria organize themselves in predictable patterns—a finding that could help researchers engineer more efficient designer bacteria.
The study found that cyanobacteria produce carboxysomes—organelles instrumental in the process of carbon fixation—in quantities proportional to the length of their longest axis and subsequently align these organelles uniformly along the axis, according to David F. Savage, HMS research fellow and co-lead author of the study.
The structural precision of the carboxysomes’ positioning—which is not often found within single-celled organisms—increases the efficiency of the cyanobacteria’s carbon fixation, the process through which gaseous carbon is converted into organic fuel molecules, according to Savage.
Autotrophs, such as cyanobacteria, produce complex organic molecules from simpler inorganic compounds using solar energy through the process of photosynthesis.
The HMS researchers said that scientists hope to use cyanobacteria as a model organism to create genetically-modified designer bacteria capable of producing biofuels. Greater carbon fixation efficiency in cyanobacteria would increase the efficiency of biofuel production in these bacteria, according to the research team.
“The bigger vision is one of sustainability,” said Pamela A. Silver, co-author of the study and professor of systems biology at HMS. “Ideally you could have an organism that you could program to make anything you wanted using only sunlight—you could use it, for example, to provide energy for the third world.”
Designer cyanobacteria could also provide cheaper ways to produce biofuel, Silver added.
The study represents “an interesting example in which you’re doing applied research and then you make some interesting basic fact-findings also,” Savage said.
The HMS researchers said that they plan to focus next on strains of cyanobacteria that use an engineered lipid synthesis pathway that allows the bacteria to directly secrete biofuels into growth medium.
The study was funded by the U.S. Army Research Office through a grant seeking to engineer cyanobacteria that produces biofuel molecules, such as hydrogen and biodiesel.
The study’s results were published in the Mar. 5 issue of “Science.”

Molecular and Cellular Biology concentrator Amy Guan ’12 is taking the research world by storm, performing cutting-edge research with super-charged fluorescent proteins in the lab of MCB Professor David Liu.
Last October, Guan began working with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) to “improve activities of proteins and enzymes.”
According to Guan, part of the theory behind her research, discovered by members of the lab team she works with, is that proteins that are not water-soluble tend to clump together, thereby diminishing the ability of each protein to function. When the residues of these GFP proteins are positively charged, however, they have the ability to penetrate cell walls. Additionally, these super-charged proteins demonstrated the ability to carry nucleic, and even genomic, material into cells if the material was negatively charged.
Guan didn’t seek out the Liu lab; rather, her interest in directed evolution, a major part of her life since her junior year of high school, allowed it to effectively find her.
Guan, a resident of Eliot House from Florida, was born in China and has lived in four countries to date because of her mother’s occupation. The summer before starting her job at the Liu laboratory, Guan attended the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition (iGEM), in which student teams design and create biological systems in living cells. David Thompson, the graduate student who is currently running the project Guan is working on, happened to be the teaching fellow working with Guan’s group at iGEM.
“[After the competition], he contacted me directly to join the lab,” Guan said.
Her project on super-charged proteins will likely have significant medicinal value in the near future.
“These supercharged fluorescent proteins may hold promise,” Guan said, “as a very nontoxic, very efficient way to deliver therapeutic agents into cells.”
Investors are beginning to take notice, as some are currently looking into the research being done by Guan and the others working in the Liu laboratory. But, clearly, the proteins aren’t the only things in the lab with a promising future.
“[Amy is very] technically skilled, has good ‘lab hands,’” Thompson said. “[She is] better than any undergrads I’ve worked with, better than some grad students.  [She’s] excitable and enthusiastic about science in general, and about her research projects in particular.”
“[This] is extremely important in research science,” he added. “Because 9/10 things you do will fail, and you need to keep your head up to stop from floundering… Amy seems to have that excitability, and sense of wonder.”
Guan is in the research business for the long haul. She plans to continue working in the Liu laboratory to complete her thesis and take her investigations to the next level.
“I want to go to grad school, [to study] either biology or chemical biology,” Guan said. “This is probably what I’m going to do for the rest of my life.”
Though many of the details concerning the current experiments going on in the Liu laboratory are classified information, Guan continues to help the team investigate properties of the GFP proteins and expand upon recent discoveries.

The discovery of a dwarf galaxy star nearly as old as the universe has provided a missing link in supporting the “cannibalistic” theory of galaxy formation, according to a study led by Harvard researcher Anna Frebel that was published in the journal “Nature” this month.
For years astronomers have discussed the theory that the Milky Way formed by “eating up” smaller dwarf galaxies, but there was a crucial piece of evidence absent from such an explanation, said Frebel, who is a researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.
“Previously, nobody had found any stars in the dwarf galaxies that looked very much like the most metal-poor stars in the Milky Way halo,” said Joshua D. Simon, a researcher at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and one of the study’s authors.  “It was reasonable to wonder if maybe they didn’t exist.”
But after hours of stargazing and spectroscopic measurements, a star in a distant dwarf galaxy called the Sculptor Galaxy has proven to be chemically similar to several stars found in the Milky Way halo.
“It looks like many dwarf galaxies got shredded and deposited their stars in the halo of the Milky Way,” Frebel said.
Astronomers can determine how long ago a star was created by measuring its metal content because stars that contain more elements beyond hydrogen and helium are newer than “metal-poor” stars like the one found in the Sculptor Galaxy.
In our roughly 13.7 billion year old universe, Frebel said she estimated that the star in Sculptor was 12 to 13 billion years old.
“If we’re in middle age now, this star was born when the universe was basically a toddler,” said Evan N. Kirby, a researcher at California Institute of Technology and one of the authors.
According to Simon, previous methods of detecting metal-poor stars proved less useful the more metal-poor the star was.
“They kind of hit a floor in the metal abundance they would give you,” he said.
Finding a more accurate way to obtain these measurements was the subject of Kirby’s PhD thesis.
Using the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, Kirby set out to find evidence of metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies by scanning the skies using medium-resolution spectroscopy, which allowed him to study many stars but didn’t yield a detail-rich characterization of any one star.
“I pointed the spectrometer at Sculptor and other galaxies, and out of about 400 stars in the sky I noticed this one,” he said.
He then offered the coordinates of this star to Frebel, who departed for Chile to take a closer look with the Magellen-Clay Telescope using high-resolution spectroscopy. Though this kind of spectroscopy takes much longer, it provides more details about the “personality” of the star, Frebel said.
She explained that gathering data for the star took eight to ten hours spanning two or three nights. A typical resolution, she added, usually takes one to two hours.
Besides time constraints, Frebel also had to keep an eye on the weather.  Even mild cloud cover or slight winds can greatly interfere with nightly measurements, she said.
“We don’t want the stars to twinkle—we want them to stare at us straight without ever winking,” she explained.
Astronomy professor Abraham “Avi” Loeb, who is writing a book about how the first galaxies were created, called Frebel a pioneer, and said he believes this research puts the theory that the galaxy was formed out of small building blocks “on more robust ground.”
Frebel is back in Chile this week continuing the same line of research, hoping to find even more metal-poor stars in dwarf galaxies.
“Now that we’ve smelled blood we want to look out farther and observe fainter stars to test the merging theory in more detail,” she said.

Over the past few years, the number of undergraduates concentrators in engineering has seen a significant increase, largely due to the University’s concerted efforts to increase visibility and outreach for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.
In the 2000-2001 academic year, 79 students obtained either a Bachelor’s or a Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering Sciences. The number has grown to 150 students for the current academic year.
In an e-mailed statement, Dean of SEAS Cherry A. Murray ascribed the upward growth to the efforts of her predecessor Venkatesh “Venky” Narayanamurti, who “successfully transitioned the former Division into a School.”
Murray also cited the collaboration with other departments and the Unviersity’s role in supporting SEAS as integral factors that bolstered a stronger sense of community.
In particular, Murray pointed out the school’s enhanced communications efforts in stimulating this growth, such as its new Web site, print materials available for current and prospective students, and the use of social networking sites to spread the word.
Venky said that the rising interest in engineering has been fairly steady over the past decade, though the trend has seen fluctuations in light of the economy.
Some current students credit the field’s practicality and versatility in making engineering an attractive concentration choice.
“It seemed like a good idea because it provided a good academic background to do a lot of things after graduation,” said Matthew J. O’Brien ’10. “When I came to college I didn’t know what I wanted to do, and Engineering seemed like something that ruled out very little.”
But such seemingly unstoppable growth is not without its potential drawbacks, said Venky, who cited the issue of having the requisite facilities to support such an increase in interest.
“There are always issues of having enough lab facilities for teaching,” Venky said. “Ultimately we will need greater physical space, and I see that as the greatest limitation here.”
Venky dismissed the notion that an increased number of engineering concentrators would worsen the faculty-student ratio, and said that SEAS would either add more faculty and more space—or stop the growth entirely.
With the creation of distinct engineering concentrations such as the new Biomedical Engineering concentration, Venky said he predicted more Engineering concentrators as interest rises.
He said this was particularly true of bioengineering and computer science-related areas such as information technology and nanotechnology, which are both growing fields.
Many students view this general trend in a positive light, saying that the engineering program can only be helped by further expansion as it creates more opportunities for students.
“Given where the program is right now, we can definitely take more engineers and still retain the same positives,” said Colin H. Santangelo ’11.

Parents may need to monitor their newborn baby’s weight gain carefully, as part of an ongoing Harvard Medical School study found that significant weight gain during the first six months of life may put a child at risk for obesity by age three.
While the link between birth weight and obesity has previously been investigated, this study is the first to look at weight gain in the first few months of life and brings into question the effectiveness of current health care policies, which are largely aimed at school-age children.
“There is increasing evidence that rapid changes in weight during infancy increase children’s risk of later obesity,” explained lead author Elsie M. Taveras, a professor of Ambulatory Care and Prevention and Pediatrics at HMS and co-director of the One Step Ahead clinic at Children’s Hospital Boston, in a HMS press release. “The mounting evidence suggests that infancy may be a critical period during which to prevent childhood obesity and its related consequences.”
During the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the United States. Currently, one in three children is overweight or obese–a statistic President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are citing in creating the “Let’s Move” program to end childhood obesity. Additionally, one in 10 children under the age of two is overweight or obese.
However, obesity prevention programs for infants and toddlers have been avoided so far.
“It used to be kind of taboo to label a child under five as overweight or obese, even if the child was–the thinking was that it was too stigmatizing,” said Taveras in a New York Times article.
The new evidence suggests that although recent policies have not been incorrect, they could be described as too little, too late.
As Dr. Taveras stated in the press release, “the earliest interventions will have the greatest long-term benefits.”
The study was published in the journal “Pediatrics” last year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With up-to-date geographic data on Haiti after the devastating earthquake of  January 12, 2010 scattered around different Web sites and agencies, relief workers in Haiti may find themselves with a headache when trying to find a central Web site containing comprehensive geographic information.
For that purpose, Harvard computer experts designed the Haiti Earthquake Data Portal, a
Web site that contains thirty-five processed datasets and fourteen links to various online maps, gathered from a variety of sources ranging from declassified legacy military materials to data of university researchers across the nation.
“The data was looking for a home, you know, and I was out pushing everybody’s button saying, this is a place where I want to host the data,” said Merrick L. Berman, research manager for the Center for Geographic Analysis and designer of the online portal.
Within ten minutes a researcher can have a working Geographic Information System environment with data downloaded from the Web site, Berman explained, but it takes hours or days to try to figure out which search result from Google to use.
In order to get the data, Berman had to coordinate various efforts from different agencies. The most amazing thing about creating this portal, Berman said, was to talk to those agencies and individuals of similar minds and to see them come together in this concerted effort to aid Haiti.
However, Mikael Schinazi ‘12, who went to Haiti before the earthquake in December 2009 with a Boston-based NGO, presented an alternative viewpoint.
Schinazi said that the real problem at Haiti is the lack of infrastructure instead of the lack of geographic data.
“I don’t really see why we would need such a Web site if you were in Haiti,” Schinazi said, based on his own experience.
According to Schinazi, there was only one route at the place he worked so that a street map was not necessary. In addition, their Haitian driver knew the place very well and stayed with them all the time, and he could always ask local people for direction along the road.
Moreover, Schinazi said that he learnt from a United Nations worker that the UN headquarters supported the ground effort by giving the UN workers data from satellites.

Following a year-long process to develop an online room reservation tool for the College, the Undergraduate Council officially launched “UC Rooms” this week, a Web site that allows student groups and individuals to book common spaces on campus.
UC Rooms allows users to search for available rooms by room type, capacity, capabilities, location, and restrictions on who can reserve the space.
In December, the UC had released a public spreadsheet of common room information that—according to UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11—was “a big step forward” but still needed to be organized into a more easily navigable database.
The UC hired student programmer Punit N. Shah ’12 in December to develop a user-friendly site with an estimated launch date of Feb. 2010.
“What we’ve now done is taken all the spreadsheet data—which wasn’t in the easiest format to use—and put it into a really powerful yet simple search engine,” Hysen said.
According Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12, the tool attracted over 400 hits the day of its release on Tuesday and received positive feedback from student groups, including the Chinese Student Association, the Harvard Opportunes, and the Harvard Black Student Association.
BSA President Spencer H. Hardwick ’11, an inactive Crimson news editor, said reserving a room as a student organization had traditionally been a “very time-consuming and meticiulous process” and a “huge hassle.”
In the past, Hardwick said that he usually had to reserve rooms for BSA-run events multiple months in advance in order to navigate the complicated reservation system.
The new Web site, Hardwick said, would alleviate much of the frustration that many student groups previously faced.
“It’s really refreshing to see, and it’s a really huge boost for us,” Hardwick said. “It’s one less thing to worry when you’re trying organize an event.”
Hysen hailed the room reservation tool as a step to address issues raised from the student body.
“This tool is a really good example of what is feasible for the UC to do short term, making students lives eaiser now while also working on even bigger changes for the long term,” Hysen added.

When Harvard nanotechnology researcher Michael P. Stopa went to the polls in 2008, there was only one name on the ballot for the Third District of Massachusetts’s Congressional seat—incumbent Democrat Jim McGovern.
Partly in response to what he said he saw as a lack of alternatives for voters, Stopa declared his candidacy for the position, and he held a campaign kickoff event on Sunday.
“I thought, ‘Next time, the least I can do is go out there and collect the signatures so that this guy can have someone to run against,’” said Stopa, who works at the Center for Nanoscale Systems.
The Third District is traditionally a Democratic stronghold, and McGovern has run unopposed in three of the last four elections. But Stopa said that there has been a call for conservative candidates in the district, which includes both “Democratic havens” of Fall River and Worcester and more conservative middle class suburbs of Boston.
In the recent special election to fill the vacant U.S. Senate seat, winner and current Republican Senator Scott P. Brown only lost two towns in the Third District.
“The momentum is on the Republican side, but November is still a long ways off,” said Harvard Republican Club President Mark A. Isaacson ’11, who is also a editorial columnist for The Crimson. “There is
certainly a great deal of work to do, especially in those traditionally Democratic districts.”
In the Sep. 14 primary, Stopa will face at least four other Republicans: Robert J. Chipman, who specializes in construction loans at Wells Fargo, lawyers Robert Delle and Marty Lamb, and Chair of the Hopkinton Board of Selectman Brian J. Herr.
Stopa said he plans to focus on fiscal responsibility, health care reform, and immigration. He said that like voters, he is nervous and angry about the current direction of the country.
His experience as a conservative in the traditionally liberal communities of Harvard and Cambridge also had an “instigating effect” on his interest in running for office as a Republican, Stopa said. But he added he often does not discuss his against-the-grain political views with his liberal colleagues.
In fact, his friend Robert M. Westervelt, a physics professor at Harvard, said he was unaware of Stopa’s campaign and did not know Stopa’s political leanings. Although their political views fall on different sides of the aisle, Westervelt said he believes that Stopa would do a good job if elected.
“He’s very patient, and he wants to find out what other people think,” Westervelt said. “He molds what he’s doing to problems people are interested in. Those are the kind of properties you’d like to have in a leader.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Five departmental collections in the Museum of Comparative Zoology are facing a yearlong move from their age-old home on Oxford St. into the basement of the Northwest Science Building, after a series of clouded administrative indecisiveness that prompted some confusion among the staff.
Though the move has been under discussion for more than ten years, the museum only won a month and a half ago the approval of Faculty of Arts and Sciences Divisional Dean of Sciences Jeremy Bloxham and FAS Dean Michael D. Smith to move into three rooms—measuring out to 50,000 square feet—in the Northwest Building.
The MCZ hopes to renovate and move into their state-of-the-art facilities in early 2011—a project that will cost more than 18 and a half million dollars, with the move itself costing one million dollars, according to MCZ Director James Hanken.
Faced with a constant stream of acquisitions while housed in a “substandard” facility, the museum has long run out of space, Hanken said.
“We’ve been increasingly cramped in the present case—the specimens have been packed together, making it hard to access and work on them,” Hanken said. “We’ve needed to decompress them.”
With the move now seemingly definite, the MCZ staff is finalizing plans for the renovation and move of at least 10 million artifacts one tenth of a mile down the street—a move that will allow the MCZ to continue growing without worrying about the condition of its specimens.
THE LAND OF MILK AND HONEY
The space in Northwest can be likened to a blank slate upon which the MCZ can construct the very conditions that its current home—which was built according to 19th century standards—cannot provide.
The Oxford St. residence lacks humidity control and centralized air conditioning—which bodes poorly for delicate specimens—and its flimsy upper floors are in danger of collapsing from too much weight, Hanken said. Leaks in the roof need to be mended, and the building supports very limited information technology infrastructure.
“Everybody’s recognized this for years, that we needed better quarters,” Hanken said. “When the Northwest lab was being designed, it was recognized as an opportunity to accommodate a lot of the MCZ’s collections.”
Most museum staffers agree that the new state-of-the-art space in Northwest has clear functional advantages over the aging facility it currently occupies: foremost, a new heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system that will keep temperatures and humidities stable throughout the year to protect sensitive specimens like skins and skeletons and to prevent insect infestations.
Hanken said that on certain occasions, the museum has had to turn down specimens because “we simply can’t accommodate.” And if a researcher wants to come to work in the museum building, “we don’t really have anywhere to put them, at this point,” said Alana V. Rivera, a curatorial assistant.
At the moment, three large rooms in the basement of Northwest await refurbishment—and the potential is almost tangible. “They could be wonderful,” said Hanken, who noted that the space would give the museum the capacity to grow for another one to two decades.
The planned renovations include equipping the space with stainless steel cabinetry to accommodate specimens and greater storage space that would be especially useful for oversized items in the paleontological department. During the move itself, the museum can also rearrange its collections in better taxonomic order.
The impending renovations—which will occur in three installments over the course of three years—will also include the installation of lighting and the construction of specimen preparation labs, teaching space, and curatorial staff area, according to Hanken.
AN UNCERTAIN TIMELINE
Five of the ten departmental collections are slated to move underground—invertebrate paleontology, vertebrate paleontology, malacology, mammalogy, and ornithology, according to Hanken.
He said the museum’s “spirit collections” that preserve specimens in alcohol—invertebrate zoology, herpetology, and ichthyology—will not move because alcohol cannot be housed below grade, in accordance with fire regulations.
Hanken added that the MCZ relinquished ownership of the remaining space in the building on Oxford St. The Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology is rumored to fill the vacancy, with OEB Professor John R. Wakeley getting a small office in the space. What is certain is that the space will not be used for laboratories.
“I won’t doubt that other departments in FAS might look longingly at the space available,” said William Amaral, former preparation facility manager in the vertebrate paleontology collection, in an interview with The Crimson last year. Amaral has since retired from the University.
Amaral noted that the top floor of the building—which is currently occupied by the ornithology division—is prime property: “It’s a nice spot. I’d have to know what the museum was getting in return for giving up that space.”
The planners of the Northwest specifically earmarked basement space for MCZ during the design process, according to Hanken. Still, months passed before FAS gave its official approval for the move, leaving Hanken concerned before the decision was made formal.
Spaces are “real premium” at the University and generates “competing uses for space,” Amaral said.
“That’s why I’m very anxious to get the decision made,” Hanken said in an interview last year, adding that there was “always the chance” the allocated space could have ended up in the hands of a different University interest unless the current plan met definite approval.
SENTIMENTAL PROGRESS
The MCZ has called its building on Oxford St. its home since the edifice was established in 1859.
“I think there’s a bit sentimentality,” said Linda S. Ford, Director of Collections Operations. “Even with all the problems because this building’s age, all the people love this building.”
“It was designed and built as a zoology museum, and now it’s going to be split in half and other departments are moving in here—and that to me is really sad,” said curatorial associate Judith Chupasko in an interview last year. “I really love the space here...It bums me out.”
Chupasko, who believes that the mammology collection has space to grow after renovations, said she does not think the current MCZ building is necessarily impeding growth of the collections. “I don’t think it’s that,” she said regarding the primary reason for the move. “I think it’s bigger than me and what I’m informed about.”
“I get a little scared. Is it that ‘divide and conquer’ thing? They’re dividing it up so it’s easier to—I don’t know—feed me to the lions?” Chupasko added. “I think the main reason for the move is to store the collections better...but I don’t know what the bigger forces are behind the move.”
Amaral said that initially, the ornithology and mammology collections were “definitely slated” for a move into the basement space because of their liability with potential infestations, but “they kept adding more and more departments.”
“I suspect, as I see it, that the birds and mammals were the first concern, and as they got along with that plan, they realized how much space would be available when those departments moved,” Amaral said. “It snowballed to FAS or OEB saying, ‘Wow, look how much space we could get if this department and this department move.’”

Harvard Law School’s Northwest Corner building project—which will significantly expand space available for both academic and student activities—is under budget and ahead of schedule, slated for completion in December 2011, Law School administrators said.
“We’re not declaring victory yet,” said Dean of Administration Francis X. McCrossan, noting that construction, which broke ground in 2007, will continue for another 18 months before completion. “But we are pretty confident that we will come in at or a little bit better than budget.”
The project also includes an underground parking lot that can accommodate 695 vehicles and will be open to faculty and staff across the University.
The parking lot is about 80 percent complete and will begin to open in the third week of August 2010, said University Director of Transportation Services John Nolan. Currently, the parking garage is about 5.5 percent under budget.
Administrators declined to comment on the total cost of the Northwest Corner project.
The decreased cost can largely be attributed to lower interest rates on the debt used to finance construction in the wake of the financial crisis, according to Construction and Project Manager Mark R. Johnson.
The initial budget also overestimated the costs of a contamination incident from a cleaner next door, Nolan said.
The 250,000 square foot building will create new custodial, staff, and maintenance jobs when it opens, according to McCrossan. Over the next six months, McCrossan and his team will gauge how many additional staff members the building will require.
Northwest Corner is divided into three components, officially named Wasserstein Hall, Caspersen Student Center, and the Clinical Wing. The entire Corner is now frequently referred to as “Wasserstein Caspersen Clinical,” or “WCC” for short. The Clinical Wing serves as a potential naming opportunity for a major donor.
Law School alumnus Finn M. W. Caspersen gave $30 million—the largest gift in the Law School’s history­—to fund a wing of the Northwest Corner. After he committed suicide in 2009, media outlets reported that he was under investigation by the IRS for tax evasion, but McCrossan said there has been no indication that his gift to the Law School will be clawed back due to the IRS inquiries.
The Caspersen Student Center was largely modeled on the Business School’s Spangler Hall and will include a spacious lounge area and increased dining facilities.
“This new student gathering place is finally sized for our student body,” McCrossan said. “It will allow us to take better care of our students.”
Bruce J. Wasserstein, who also graduated from the Law School and passed away last year, donated $25 million for the building.
The Wasserstein Hall component of Northwest Corner will house almost all of the Law School’s classroom spaces. The classrooms will be configured for about 85 students—the average size of Law School sections, down from about 140 in the past—according to McCrossan.
“It will make a big difference in how the curriculum will be delivered,” he said.
The building will also include more individual breakout spaces to allow for student-to-student and professor-to-student interaction, McCrossan said. Though the current classrooms in Pound Hall will continued to be used, they may eventually be converted into office space.
The Clinical component of the building will house the Law School’s fast-growing clinical program, student organizations, and journals. In the past, most student groups met in the basements of different buildings, and clinics were spread all over campus and Harvard Square, where the Law School had begun to rent space to accommodate the programs.
Though the prestigious Harvard Law Review will remain in Gannett House, student publications and clubs will now be grouped together to encourage student exchange across groups.
“It will give students a wonderful space to come together and be successful in their law school endeavors,” Nolan said.
GREEN FROM THE GROUND UP
The Northwest Corner complex is expected to receive Gold LEED certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), one of the highest award levels for environmental design.
The Law School hired Atelier Ten, an environmental design consulting firm, to assist throughout the project. Atelier Ten has worked on projects at Harvard Business School and has played a role in almost all of Yale’s recent building projects, according to Emilie N. Hagen, an associate at the firm who advised the Northwest Corner project.
Hagen said that the firm conducted extensive analyses of daylight performance and other climate factors in the early stages of building design and guided the Law School through the LEED certification process.
Though the project managers did not specifically aim for Gold certification, the Law School tried to find ways to incorporate environmentally friendly materials as long as they were financially feasible.
The building takes advantage of as much natural light as possible and reuses rainwater from the roof for irrigation. Seventy-five percent of the construction waste is being recycled or reused rather than being sent to landfills, according to a report on the sustainability of the project. The parking garage will also use a “preferred parking” system—offering better spots to faculty and staff who drive high-performance, environmentally-friendly cars, Hagen said.
Though installation or up-front costs for green technology and material is often more expensive, the Law School expects to recuperate most of the costs through decreased operating expenses in the long-term, McCrossan said.
“It was very pragmatic,” Hagen said. “[HLS] really wanted to get a building that was as green as it could be for the money they had.”

In the wake of three apparent suicides at Cornell University in the past six weeks, members of the mental health community at Harvard reaffirmed their commitment to providing support for students at risk but disagreed on the need to take immediate steps in response.
The Cornell community was rocked two weeks ago when sophomore William Sinclair and junior Matthew Zika took their lives on consecutive days by jumping into the gorges that run through the campus in Ithaca, New York. The deaths came only a few weeks after freshman Bradley Ginsburg apparently died in the same manner.
“It’s honestly a very scary phenomenon,” said Paul J. Barreira, director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling for University Health Services. “I think it only proves the point that you can have a terrific suicide prevention program and a terrific campaign to care for the community, but this phenomenon can happen anyway.”
A total of six students have committed suicide at Cornell this year, while national statistics would predict about two suicides annually within Cornell’s student population of 20,000, according to comments made by Cornell Mental Health Initiatives Director Timothy Marchell to The New York Times. Between 2000 and 2009, though, the number of suicides at Cornell was at or below the national average.
According to Barreira, a situation like the one at Cornell is known as a “suicide contagion,” a period in which multiple individuals take their own lives. But he said that there is no evidence that a suicide contagion at one university could lead to a similar event at another institution.
Nonetheless, Barreira added that he plans to coordinate with residential life staff and student mental health groups in order to ensure that everyone is “more alert and more mindful” in the aftermath of the Cornell suicides. He also said that UHS will continue its efforts to educate students about how to help their depressed peers, and will be distributing its biennial health assessment survey starting today.
The Student Mental Health Liaisons—a group that coordinates with UHS and House wellness tutors to educate students about mental health resources—will likely discuss the Cornell suicides at its next meeting, said Lianna E. G. Karp ’10, one of its members. Additionally, the group may consider holding a Suicide Gatekeeper training event to teach students how to recognize signs of life-threatening depression in the coming weeks, Karp said.
“Given the difficult situation that Cornell is facing now, I think it would be appropriate for us to bring it up and have it inform our decision as to the types of activities that we will be holding on campus,” Karp said.
But Erin R. Carey, a wellness tutor in Pforzheimer House, said she has not perceived any impact of the suicides at Cornell on Harvard students.
“I haven’t heard any chatter about it in the dining hall or on our open list,” Carey said.

After months of silence since an extensive discussion at the Oct. 6 Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting, the Harvard Extension School announced yesterday that it had not forgotten plans to change its name.
The Committee on Continuing Education had discussed the possibility of renaming the Extension School to the “Harvard School of Continuing and Professional Studies,” as it felt its century-old name did not adequately reflect its mission. The term, “Extension School,” may be dropped from degree names as well.
Though the Faculty decided to postpone the vote to approve the name change for the following meeting, the proposal did not make the agenda for the last few meetings.
Dean of Continuing Education and University Extension Michael Shinagel said in a statement yesterday that the University will continue to evaluate suggested name changes, but is not prepared to make a decision at this time.
“Any proposal to change the name of any Harvard school or the name of any degree awarded by the institution warrants thorough study and consideration,” Shinagel said.
Extension School spokesperson Linda A. Cross did not clarify the cause of the delay.
Faculty and administrators involved in earlier discussions said they were uncertain where the proposal currently stands.
Professor of Computer Science Harry R. Lewis ’68, who represented the committee at the Oct. meeting, said yesterday that he is not aware of any recent developments.
At the time, English professor Elaine Scarry voiced concerns that the proposed degree titles—“Bachelor of Liberal Arts” instead of “Bachelor of Liberal Arts in Extension Studies,” for example—may be confused with degrees offered by the College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
Shinagel added that regardless of the eventual name, the school’s mission to provide students with a “first-class education” and, if they wish, a degree, has not changed.
“At the end of the day, it is what we do that matters most,” he said, “not what we are called.”

New York Times columnist Ross G. Douthat ’02 discussed the status of college conservatism in front of a packed audience in the Quincy House Junior Common Room last night.
Members of the “motley crew that is Ivy-League conservatism” need to defend their ideology against “the liberal center encompassing the majority of the student body and the administration,” Douthat said.
Reminiscing about his undergraduate years, Douthat recalled an annual conference of conservatives at Harvard and Yale composed of “an ecclectic group of Reaganite Republicans, Catholics lamenting the end of the reign of the House of Stuart, and liberal anarchists.”
Offering advice to conservative undergraduates in attendance, Douthat said that “the job of the American conservative is to explain why they’re right.”
Comparing polls indicating that an increasing number of incoming undergraduates place greater importance on “success” rather than “constructing a philosophy of life,” Douthat concluded that students often work towards success for success’ sake.
“Students often focus too much on sex and money,” Douthat said. “As you get older, the drive for money only increases, while the drive for sex tends to decrease.”
Douthat also criticized Harvard’s General Education curriculum and its Core Curriculum predecessor for not focusing on the “great canon of western thought.”
According to Douthat, political polarization leads many to shy away from choosing specific authors or texts as a required part of a curriculum out of a fear of showing a bias for one culture over another.
Douthat also urged students to take more classes in the humanities—especially those in western civilization, history, and literature.
“Conservative students should take more classes in departments such as English and literature,” he said. “Because these classes are full of some of the most liberal professors on campus, and they will challenge you and force you to justify your views.”
Some of the students in attendance said they appreciated Douthat’s views on campus politics.
“It was really great to hear from someone who was here not so long ago and who is now one of the most important voices in American punditry,” Benjamin B.H. Wilcox ’13 said. “I thought it was great that he challenged conservative students to take classes that challenge their beliefs,” Wilcox added.
“It was important that he discussed how some issues seem much more important on campus than they really are,” Derek J. Bekebrede ’13 said. “Sometimes issues such as conflict in the Middle East and ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell’ don’t receive as much interest as campus life issues even though they are ultimately much more important.”

Lent is a time for penance in the Christian tradition, but Divinity School Professor Mark D. Jordan said during his talk “Same-Sex Marriage and the Prospects for Christian Ethics” that it could also be a time for reexamination and renewed hope.
“What better time to talk about sex in church than Lent?” he joked.
Jordan’s talk at Memorial Church last night centered around his argument that the concept of Christian marriage needs to be rethought.
According to Jordan, many aspects of traditional wedding rituals are not necessarily religious.
“We must make serious reflections on what the church accomplishes in the blessing of all marriages, not only same-sex marriages,” he said.
Jordan added that he was surprised by the number of LGBT couples who had approached local churches to ask for their union to be blessed.
“It’s astonishing that same-sex couples still come forth to ask for blessing of their intimate unions without expecting that they will get legal benefits,” he said. “They come just in order to be blessed.”
But Jordan said that he has also spoken to many same-sex couples who were suspicious of churches and of the institution of marriage as a whole.
According to Jordan, the solution was not necessarily to bless all couples, but to reconsider the institution of marriage.
“When it comes to same-sex marriage, we must make a candid and critical examination of the theoretical basis for any Christian marriage,” he said.
Jordan’s talk marked the final event in the fifth annual Lenten Series, a series of talks organized as a combined effort of Memorial Church and the Episcopal Chaplaincy.
“Undergrads don’t often get to talk about sex in a religious context,” said the Reverend Jonathan C. Page, one of the program’s organizers and the Epps Fellow in Memorial Church. “Marriage is an important part of that discussion.”
Karen S. Bray, a student of feminist and queer theology at the Divinity School who has taken Jordan’s classes, said that he helps his students and others think broadly and imaginatively about where theology comes from.
“If someone wants their union to be blessed, it should be blessed,” Bray said. She added that examining where rituals such as marriage originate is the only way to move forward.
“Before we try to bless anything, we should think constructively about what presuppositions we’re bringing to the table,” she said.
Jordan concluded his talk by saying that there remains a lot of debate in the Christian community, both between denominations and individuals, on issues of same-sex marriage and sexual ethics in general.
“When Christians disagree this strongly but want to remain Christians together, we have to pray for each other,” he said.

A group of around forty Harvard employees, students, and sympathetic local citizens gathered outside the Holyoke Center yesterday evening to protest the University’s labor policies, calling for more fiscal transparency and an end to furloughs.
Protestors demanded that Harvard “open their books” to prove that they cannot create more union jobs, despite difficult financial times.
“It is abundantly clear to one and all that Harvard has the money to satisfy our demands,” said Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers member Thompson Potter, referencing the University’s $26 billion dollar endowment.
The protest also focused on the conversion of full-year positions into seasonal jobs.
“We want Harvard to create more union jobs and stop exploiting temps,” said HUCTW member Geoffrey Carens. Carens, who helped organize the protest, is part of a leftist core group of about 10 union members known as “Reform HUCTW” that does not represent the views of all union members.
HUCTW members were joined by  Service Employees International Union  Local 615 members, and college students from the Student Labor Action Movement.
The protesters carried posters that read “Harvard Gambles, Workers Lose” and “Layoffs Are Not the New Crimson” and chanted mantras such as “they say cutback, we say fight back, they say layoff we say back off, they say furlough we say hell no.”
College students from SLAM said they were happy to be at the protest to show their support for the University’s laborers.
“The student body is waking up a little bit,” said SLAM member Colette S. Perold ’11. “We are here and we are keeping our eyes peeled.”
The protest came in the wake of HUCTW’s announcement that it has begun its eighth round of contract negotiations with the University. To mark the beginning of negotiations, the union released a letter which emphasized the generally amicable relationship between Harvard and the union.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With the recent creation of a separate office for research strategy, the Harvard School of Public Health was well equipped to handle the January revisions to the National Institutes of Health grant application process.
School of Public Health Dean Julio Frenk had established a new Office of Research Strategy and Development to help faculty navigate the grant application process shortly after stepping into his position in Jan. 2009.
And after NIH announced the changes in its grant application procedure, Associate Dean of Research Karen M. Emmons, who heads the new office, began preparing informational sessions for faculty to clarify what the changes mean for their grant proposals.
The changes—which streamline the application process by cutting page limits in half and limiting the number of revision opportunities to one—may pose additional challenges for junior faculty, who have less space to lay out a convincing proposal, Emmons said. Applicants will be assigned an “impact score” based on the potential of the proposed research.
“I think it’s going to make it a lot harder for junior faculty,” Emmons said, adding that the School of Public Health has allocated resources to provide outside feedback for junior faculty before they submit their grants. “The idea is to try and make sure that we’re facilitating our faculty’s research in every way that we can.”
Several junior faculty members at the school expressed concern about the impact of the changes on their grant proposals.
“I think the review process is more superficial somehow because there is less space,” said Alessandro Doria, an associate professor of epidemiology who conducts research at the Harvard-affiliate Joslin Diabetes Center. “Perhaps the application will be more direct, but some of the reasoning might be lost.”
Despite his similar concerns, Yi Li, an associate professor of biostatistics, acknowledged that the NIH revisions may improve the efficiency of the application process.
“Now it will let reviewers see clearly the big picture of the grant without knowing too much [of the] details,” Li said.
But Emmons believes that her office will be able to help the school maintain their high success rate in NIH grant awards, with 30 to 40 percent of proposals receiving federal funding.
“Over the past few years, like most other academic research institutions, we have seen more competition for fewer federal grant dollars,” Emmons wrote in an e-mail. “The landscape is likely to get even more competitive over the coming years.”

Three Harvard professors, who represent a wide variety of disciplines across the University, and their spouses will lead Cabot, Eliot, and Mather Houses as House Masters next year, the College announced today.
Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and Tobin Project Acting Executive Director Stephanie Khurana will take the helm at Cabot House. Harvard Stem Cell Institute Co-director and Natural Sciences Professor Douglas A. Melton and educational consultant Gail O’Keefe will lead Eliot House. French and Comparative Literature Professor Christie McDonald and McGill University Associate Professor of Medicine Michael D. Rosengarten will be put in charge of Mather House.
“Each of the new masters—Professors Rakesh Khurana, Doug Melton, and Christie McDonald—are leading scholars in their fields," Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds said in a statement. "But more important than their scholarly contributions, they are, alongside their spouses, wonderful, outgoing people who have a passion for working with and mentoring students.”
Within a span of two weeks during the end of 2009, three of the 13 sets of House Masters announced their resignations, citing a variety of reasons ranging from a heavy workload to a general feeling that this academic year would be an appropriate one to have as their last.
Hammonds begins the House Master search process by canvassing her colleagues to find interested professors, according to Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson. Each House convenes House advisory groups involving tutors, students, and staff, and the potential candidates visit the Houses to meet with these groups. These committees provide input on the candidates via surveys, but Hammonds makes the final decisions, Nelson said.
An author of three books and an organizational sociologist by training, Khurana conducts research on corporate leadership and teaches a doctoral seminar on management and corporate governance. Along with his wife Stephanie, a former co-founder and CEO of technology company Surebridge, Khurana will bring his three children—Sonia, Nalini, and Jai, who are 13, 11, and 7-years-old, respectively—to Cabot House.
Melton, one of TIME Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2007 and in 2009, has garnered acclaim as a leader in field of stem cell research. This year, he co-taught the introductory course in the newly-created Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology concentration. O’Keefe, his wife, works to improve high-risk students’ access to quality education as part of the Education Collaborative for Greater Boston.
McDonald, a world-renowned scholar of 18th century French literature, focuses her research on the relationship between literature and the social sciences and arts. Her husband, a cardiologist, is the associate dean of the Center for Continuing Health Professional Education at McGill.
Rosengarten and McDonald will be replacing current Mather House Masters Sandra F. Naddaff ’75 and Leigh G. Hafrey ’73, who are stepping down after leading Mather for 18 years—the longest tenure of any current Masters. Naddaff is the director of studies in the Literature concentration and also directs the Freshman Seminar Program, while Hafrey is a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan School of Management.
Lino Pertile and Anna Bensted are stepping down after ten years as Eliot House Masters. Pertile is a professor of romance languages and literatures who has been widely published in the field of Dante scholarship, and Bensted works as an assistant program director and executive producer at the National Public Radio station in Boston, WBUR.
The Khuranas will assume the roles of Jay M. Harris and Cheryl L. Harris, who will be leaving Cabot after seven years as Masters. Jay was named dean of undergraduate education by Hammonds in the summer of 2008, and he also serves as a professor of Jewish studies and chair of the General Education committee. His wife Cheryl is a school psychologist at Sharon High School.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After 16 games in Florida and California and a rained-out double-header against Bryant University earlier in the week, the Harvard softball team (4-13) finally had its home opener against Boston University (11-10).
The Crimson probably wish this one was rained out, too.
The Terriers scored 11 runs—although not without some controversy—in the top of the first on three Harvard pitchers and never looked back on the way to a 14-8 victory at Soldiers Field yesterday afternoon.
Freshman Jess Ferri started the game for the Crimson. A lead-off single, error, three walks, double, and home run later, Ferri was pulled in favor of co-captain Margaux Black.
Harvard was down, 6-0, before recording its first out of the game. Then things starting getting weird.
Black was called for six illegal pitches—including the first two she threw—for a failure to drag her pivot foot during the pitch.  The penalty for an illegal pitch in softball grants any runner on base to take the next base.
At one point, after BU’s Whitney Tuthill reached on an error, Tuthill scored after three consecutive illegal pitches. Black was eventually pulled after Rachel Hebert singled and advanced to second on an error, scoring a Terrier who was on second due to—you guessed it—another illegal pitch.
“[The umpire] wasn’t going to give up on it. He called it and called it and called it,” Black said. “It’s hard because I’ve been pitching for fourteen years now and never been called for an illegal pitch and to change something you’re not even necessarily doing wrong, that’s hard.”
The Crimson had no choice but to bring in sophomore pitcher Julia Moore, who advanced Hebert to third on her first pitch of the outing, yet another called illegal pitch. After walking the next batter, Hebert scored on a illegal pitch, and an illegal pitch right after that moved the runner to second.
Moore, clearly rattled by the umpire, walked the following batter and hit the next to load the bases—placing Harvard down 10-0 and still with no outs.
Coach Jenny Allard then decided to bring Ferri back in to try to close out the first.
After giving up an RBI single, Ferri settled down and retired the next three batters to end the top of the first inning and the 45 minutes of drama that came with it.
“Margaux Black had never been called for an illegal pitch in the three years of her career before this game,” Allard said. “The umpire had made a complete mockery of the game by the time Moore was called for her illegal pitches. Jess Ferri did not give us a good start…but the next few runs were just a joke. I’ve never seen anything like this in my life.”
After BU knocked in two more runs in the second, the Crimson looked lifeless. A squad that prides itself on its defense and pitching had given up 13 runs, committed four errors, walked eight batters, and thrown nine illegal pitches.
Harvard remained determined at the plate, though, scoring six runs on six hits in the third—including a three-run jack by senior Jennifer Francis.
And in the fourth inning it was the Crimson who was able to take advantage of the illegal pitches.
Sophomore Jane Alexander was hit by a pitch and then advanced to second on an illegal pitch. Francis followed with her fourth RBI of the game, a single that brought Alexander home and narrowed the deficit to only five runs heading into the fifth inning, 13-8.
“We’ve really been trying to focus on our at-bats,” Allard said. “They buckled down and really stayed focused. We really earned those runs and it was great to see.”
Although hard to imagine, the last three innings turned out to be a pitchers’ duel. The Crimson’s sophomore Rachel Brown hurled four innings in relief, limiting the Terriers to only a single run on three hits. Boston University was able to counter with Megan Currier, who gave up only a single in the last three innings to ice the victory for the Terriers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hiding in the middle of a schedule full of nationally ranked foes, the No. 16 Harvard men’s lacrosse team’s game against Dartmouth (2-3, 0-0 Ivy) Saturday might not turn heads immediately.
But for a team coming off a heartbreaking loss to Brown, the weekend contest against the Big Green offers something else—the chance for rejuvenation.
“I think one of our goals is to really kind of bounce back,” Crimson coach John Tillman said, “[To] come out with a lot of energy, and really be excited to play from the opening whistle and kind of put last week behind us.”
The same could likely be said of Dartmouth, a team coming off a tough loss of its own—a 15-3 defeat at the hands of No. 10 Duke, whom Harvard (4-2, 0-1 Ivy) faces next Friday.
And while the Big Green may not be nationally ranked, it has beaten a respected squad in Colgate and can still make a push for a bid to the Ivy League tournament.
“It means a lot,” Dartmouth coach Andrew Tower said. “I’m sure it means a lot to both teams. Every conference game means a lot to how you do at the end of the year [which effects] your ability to make the NCAA tournament.”
The Crimson must avoid letting excitement turn into impatience on offense, as it faces a Dartmouth defense designed to make offensive stars work a little harder.
Against more traditional man-to-man defenses, Harvard’s dynamic scorers might have a clear path to goal after beating their defensemen, but the Big Green’s zone defense is designed to clog up the space around the goal, making one-on-one skills less important than strong passing and fluid ball movement.
“The biggest thing is having the right zone mentality, making sure that you’re patient,” Tillman said. “When teams run zone, they want you to be impatient and then take a rushed shot instead of really looking for the best shot, not the first shot.”
This means that Harvard can’t simply rely on the one-on-one skills of attackmen such as junior Dean Gibbons and sophomores Jeff Cohen and Kevin Vaughan.
Luckily for the Crimson, it possesses a strong midfield lineup as well. Sophomore Terry White is third is on the team in scoring, behind Gibbons and Cohen, and was named to the Inside Lacrosse team of the week on March 16. Senior Jason Duboe was named a preseason All-America honorable mention by the same website.
For the strong Harvard attack and midfield units, the cohesion required to break a zone shouldn’t be lacking.
“I know that John [Tillman] has done a great job with the Harvard attack unit,” Towers said. “Both [Gibbons and Cohen] are great players. We certainly have a ton of respect for their program.”
Meanwhile, the Big Green’s defensive style could prove to be advantage for the Crimson if it is able to control possession enough.
“Usually if a team plays zone, they’ll allow you to possess the ball,” Tillman said. “And it takes a lot of pressure off your defense so you can really control time of possession. If we have the ball for one or two minutes, that’s terrific.”
The extra time to relax will be especially important given that the squad will have to contend with one of Ivy League’s premier attackers in Dartmouth senior Ari Sussman, a first team All-Ivy selection two years ago.
Sussman paces his squad with 19 points on 10 goals and nine assists. Junior attack Josh Etzion is second with 10 goals and nine assists.
“A lot of the things they do go through him,” Tillman said. “He’s a guy that we’ll certainly have to be well aware of where he is, what he’s doing. He certainly has the ability to make other players around him better, and that’s a compliment to him. So he’s a guy we’ll have to definitely keep an eye on.”
But the Crimson should be well-prepared for Sussman and the Big Green attack. It has excellent defensemen, headlined by captain Billy Geist, an Inside Lacrosse preseason All-America honorable mention selection. Sophomores Paul Pate and Dan DiMaria are also solid.
An added benefit is Harvard’s familiarity with Dartmouth’s offense, which the Crimson has been anticipating in the week of practice.
“They will kind of show you ‘This is what we’re going to run, can you stop it?’” Tillman said. “And you basically have to line up and guard, this is how we’re going to defend it and hopefully we defend it well…they’re not trying to trick you.”
Nor should there be too many tricks this weekend. It’s a game between two talented squads with winning records seeking to bounce back after tough losses and make a dent in the Ivy League.
But with a national ranking, added motivation, and a multitude of talent at both ends, Harvard has too much going for it to be stopped by the Big Green.

The Harvard women’s lacrosse team (3-3, 1-1 Ivy) will be aiming to build momentum heading into the heart of Ivy League play this weekend, as it takes on Brown (2-3, 0-2 Ivy) and Bryant (1-6, 1-2 NEC) tomorrow and Sunday, respectively.
The Crimson is coming off of a 10-4 win over Cornell—the team expected to finish fourth in the Ancient Eight.
“I think that having Cornell under our belt and knowing that they were kind of that No. 4 spot, gives us more incentive,” freshmen attacker Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “We really have to take out Brown, Yale, and Columbia, because we have a clear path to the Ivy League tournament as long as we keep our opportunities open.”
The Cornell victory might also represent Harvard’s best all-around performance to date.
“We’ve been a little streaky, up and down in the games before that,” coach Lisa Miller said. “I thought against Cornell we were consistent and disciplined. We just executed the game plan and the small things, and we did it for most of the game. Hopefully we learn from that and we take it into the next game.”
Only the top four teams in the Ivy League qualify for the season-ending Ivy League tournament, making the upcoming matchup against Brown crucial for both teams.
“All Ivy League games are a bloodbath,” co-captain Sara Flood said. “So we are expecting them to come at us really hard. We see this game as a playoff game to get into the Ivy League tournament.”
“We go into [the game] like we do every other Ivy game, like it’s the biggest game of our season,” VanderMeulen added.
Brown is likely coming into the game with the same mentality, coming off a nail biting 8-7 loss to Yale. The Bears fell off a goal scored with seven seconds remaining, leaving Brown still searching for its first Ivy win.
In preparation for the weekend, Harvard has been methodical in its preparation—doing everything from watching film to focusing on fundamentals, even having its defensive unit imitate Brown’s varying man-to-man and zone defenses.
In particular, sophomore Lauren Ianni has been crucial for the Crimson, proving to be an invaluable scout team player.
“Lauren just comes to practice every day and she’s either face guarding someone or she’s the backer,” Miller said. “She just does a phenomenal job making everyone else work.”
Yet Harvard is not going into the weekend untested, having already played a tough schedule, including then-No. 15 New Hampshire, No. 11 Boston University, and No. 4 Penn.
“At this point in the season I don’t think there is anything that either unit is going to see that’s all that different,” Miller said. “One of the reasons to have a tough schedule is to [learn]. Even though we are really young and are starting so many freshman and sophomores, we’ve seen a lot.”
Indeed, youth has been a major theme for the Crimson the season, with 87% of the goals being scored by freshman and sophomores.
VanderMeulen has been leading the way, netting a team-high 20 goals thus far.
“She’s fairly relentless—she wants to have the ball,” Miller said. “Division I lacrosse is getting pretty physical, and so she’s been drawing the best defender and she’s getting beaten up pretty significantly every game, and yet she keeps going.”
Sunday’s game against Bryant, despite not affecting the Crimson’s postseason chances, still promises to be intense, as the matchup pits Miller against one of her former players.
Bryant coach Karen Healy played women’s lacrosse for Syracuse University in 2002, when current Harvard coach Miller was coaching at SU.
“I know she’ll get them fired up,” Miller said. “They are making the difficult transition from Division II to Division I, and I think that’s a tough, tough road. But I do think the kids will play hard and they’ll compete.”
Regardless of the opponent, the Crimson knows it’s going to take a team-wide effort to play well this weekend.
“One of the reasons we are where we are, and are in a good position for the rest of the season,” Miller said, “is because of how unselfish this group is.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Have you always harbored a desire to be the next Inigo Montoya? Well, whether you’ve been a fencing fan forever or you think foil’s just something to wrap your sandwich in, this weekend is your chance to gain a better appreciation for the sport.
Gordon Track has become a mecca for modern-day swordsmen, as Harvard is hosting the 2010 NCAA Fencing Championships.
Women’s competition opened this morning with the first four rounds of each weapon. After one day of bouts, sophomore co-captain Noam Mills is sitting pretty atop the epée standings with 13 wins and 68 touches.
One of those wins came against Penn State’s Anastasia Ferdman, the senior who beat Mills in last year’s gold medal bout at NCAAs. Mills and Ferdman are both natives of Israel, and Mills competed for the Israeli Olympic team in Beijing in 2008.
Sophomore co-captain Caroline Vloka is in fifth in the sabre with 11 victories, while sophomore Shelby MacLeod and senior Artemisha Goldfeder are 11th and 12th, respectively, in the foil.
The Crimson women are fifth as a team with 46 total victories—12 off the pace set by leader St. John’s.
Day 2 of the women’s tournament begins at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow at Gordon Track. Can’t make it in person? We’ve got you covered—check The Back Page tomorrow for all the live-blogging action you could want. But in the meantime, you can see full results from the first day of competition here.

Tonight’s squash assortment didn’t quite hit the spot? Boca burger suddenly lost its appeal? Lunch’s centerpiece doesn’t look as appealing six hours later? Brain break’s got you covered.
In this four-part series, FlyBy will dish out the details of each House’s brain break so that you know where to go when dinner’s 8-cut jerk chicken wasn’t you were looking for.
Round 1: Quincy vs. Lowell vs. Adams
Evaluation Day: Wednesday
Quincy: B
Brain Break Begins: 8:30 p.m.
Quincy boasts some delicacies. At 8:30 pm, cocoa rice krispies bars, pistachio muffins, bread, and bagels were abundant, as were high-quality cream cheese packets. HUDS bread rolls completed the spread. The standard coffee and drink machines were operational.
But much to our dismay, the cereal selection left much to be desired. Far from offering the colorful assortment of cereals that most brain breaks offer, Quincy’s only had two cereals in large bowls: Marshmallow Mateys and Hemp Plus Granola. Granted, there was plenty of both to go around, but for those who want cereal but weren’t into leprechaun-cauldron-shaped marshmallows, there was no recourse.
Lowell: A-
Brain Break Begins: 8:30 p.m.
Lowell’s Brain Break was unexciting but had all the basic foods down pat. By 8:40 pm, the special item—carrot cake—had been ravaged and reduced to one lonely square. The drink machines were fully functioning.
There’s not all that much to complain about with Lowell—they did their brain break and did it right. Some more special items would have been nice though.
Adams: C+
Brain Break Begins: 10:00 p.m.
Adam’s Brain Break is guarded as if it were a U.N. aid van in a disaster zone rather than a source for food in a college dorm. At 9:58 p.m. EST, six hungry Adams  residents lined up in front of a uniformed guard. And unless you can prove your Adams residency with a recently postmarked letter or a parking ticket (okay, we're kidding about the letters, but proof of residency in Adams is sometimes actually required), don’t expect the guard to budge, and don’t expect to be able to access those oh-so-tasty HUDS cereals.
Ultimately, we were able to attend what was an unremarkable Brain Break. Don’t get us wrong, the standard goods were all there: bagels, bread, chocolate chip cookies, and a full array of cereal. Some dubious but tasty eggplant was also available. But no matter what kind of food is available at Adams’ brain break, it doesn’t really matter if you can’t get in to eat it. Because unfounded and unreasonable exclusivity is never a positive, we're forced to give this par Brain Break a subpar score.
Winner of Round 1: Lowell
This post has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 26, 2010
An earlier version of the Mar. 26 post "The Most Important Meal Of The Day: FlyBy Does Brain Break" incorrectly stated that Quincy's brain break offered Lucky Charms. In fact, the cereal's name is Marshmallow Mateys.

Sadly, Boston’s 2010 Winter Restaurant Week ends today. Since there’s really only day left, we thought we’d suggest a few local Cambridge options where you can enjoy either a two-course lunch for $15.10, a three-course lunch for $20.10, or a three-course dinner for $33.10. Even if you don’t have time, make time, as subsidized HUDS alternatives are few and far between.
Here are five options not too far from Harvard Square that are providing cheaper ways to try what is otherwise normally pretty expensive grub:
1. Henrietta’s Table at the Charles Hotel
Cuisine: A relaxing haunt for comfort favorites like pot roast and chicken pot pie, conveniently located on the mezzanine of the Charles Hotel.
Offering: Light lunch, full lunch, and dinner.
2. Rialto (also on the mezzanine Charles Hotel)
Cuisine: Chef Jody Adams’s new American masterpieces, renowned for dishes like lobster salad and Grilled Wolfe’s neck sirloin steak. Jody Adams is one of Boston’s best, so take advantage of a discounted opportunity to sample her creations, which are usually fairly pricey.
Offering: Dinner only.
3. Sandrine’s Bistro (right next to Apley Court in the Square)
Cuisine: Classic French, fussy and rich. Need we say more?
Offering: Light lunch, full lunch, and dinner.
4. Chez Henri (at Shepard Street and Mass Ave, near the Quad)
Cuisine: “Modern French Bistro with a Cuban Twist.” For Quadlings who don’t want to trek down to Sandrine’s, Chez Henri is a cozy, friendly option only a few minutes down Shepard Street from Currier, Cabot, or Pfoho.
Offering: Dinner only.
5. Evoo (118 Beacon Street in Somerville)
Cuisine: American fusion. No holds barred, this place is one of Boston’s best – Chef Peter McCarthy has a great menu of super tasty but not overly pretentious items that even college students can appreciate. Plus, Evoo, which stands for “Extra Virgin Olive Oil,” just opened in Cambridge recently. Don’t miss this one!
Offering: Dinner only.
Of course, this list is by no means conclusive. For a full list of participating restaurants in Cambridge (or even in the Boston area), check out the Restaurant Week site. Move fast – you’ve only got until dinner tonight!

Today, the College announced the appointment of three Harvard professors and their spouses as the House Masters of Cabot, Eliot, and Mather Houses.
Cabot House
Cabot will now be led by Harvard Business School Professor Rakesh Khurana and Stephanie Khurana, acting executive director of the Tobin Project, a non-profit public policy initiative. Rakesh Khurana focuses his research on corporate leadership and teaches a doctoral seminar on management and corporate governance. Stephanie Khurana co-founded and led Surebridge, a technology company.
Eliot House
Harvard Stem Cell Institute Co-director and Biology Professor Douglas A. Melton and educational consultant Gail O’Keefe will lead Eliot House. Honored multiple times by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world, Melton is considered to be a pioneer in his field. O'Keefe works to improve access to quality education for high-risk youth in the Boston area.

For those who will be traveling to and from the Quad between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. tonight, take heed. Because of the potentially large crowds flocking to the OH! The 2000s Dance, shuttles will not be turning into the Quad driveway to pick up in front of Currier. You'll have to board the shuttles on Linnaean Street—so plan your post-carousing commute accordingly!
