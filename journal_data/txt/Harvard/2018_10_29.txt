After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jonah Hill is like that one rare high school teacher who vibes with his students in a strangely fraternal way, which is to say that he understands teenagers. In “Mid90s,” which he has written and directed, he captures their essence in their baldly honest, shameless delivery, their easily-injured pride, and their arbitrary sensitivities. In the 13-year-old Stevie, played with aching vulnerability by Sunny Suljic, there is a softness behind those shifty eyes. When his older brother Ian (Lucas Hedges) pressures him to take money from his mom’s drawer, he does it, but not after saying, more to himself than anyone else, “It just doesn’t feel right.” Inexplicably fatherless, Stevie wanders the museum of sublime adolescence, his brother’s off-limits room, examining Ian’s sneakers with the reverence paid a sanctified object. His toxic relationship with his brother leads him to fumble alone toward adulthood, as he attempts to perform his own understanding of heteromasculinity, stripping his walls to make room for a women’s restroom sign, among other things. The film is set in 1990s Los Angeles and ambles along slowly with Stevie and his initiation into a clique of older skateboarders, Ray (Na-kel Smith), Fuckshit (Olan Prenatt), and Fourth Grade (Ryder McLaughlin). But Stevie’s story is alone as interesting to watch as a touching but forgettable home video tape. While Hill achieves an uncommon degree of verisimilitude in his depiction of growing-up, he under-utilizes the peripheral characters and the potentially fascinating backstories that he hints at in dialogue but never investigates.
Hill nails the politics of teenage intimacy in group settings, the way bonds are sometimes formed through inarticulate confessions rather than vulnerable discussion, lest they let their insouciant facades crumble. Ray mentions the difficulties of being black when he says, “I feel like it’s a little extra heavy on me. People judge you and stuff,” and the boys share a silent moment before they recalibrate the tone of the conversation to their flippant humor. The dialogue feels real in the sense that serious matters are broached casually and dropped. It’s leavened with nonsensical affectations and jokes that wouldn’t be so funny except for the way his actors deliver their lines; Ruben, just as young and every bit as green as Stevie, lectures him on the unwritten rules of kicking it with the cool kids. Putting on airs, Ruben tells him, “I smoke, I fuck bitches. I’m livin’ the life.” In one of the most amusing scenes, Ray asks Stevie, who has long remained silent in fear that he might embarrass himself, “Did you know black people could get sunburnt?” Stevie sputters to devise a clever response but only manages a positively puzzling, “What are black people?” which earns Ray’s affectionate laughter. From then on he is known as “Sunburn.” As hard as Stevie tries to act tough, the child in him rats him out. One night, Stevie meets the older Estee (Alexa Demie) at a party — with whom he has his first sexual experience, a scene that is uncomfortable to watch — and she tells him wistfully, “You’re like, at that age before guys become dicks.” Stevie, with his endearing lack of self-awareness, alludes to an obviously fabricated tryst at Disneyland, on which he refuses to elaborate: “I don’t kiss and tell. I’m a gentleman.”
The most wrenching scenes are of physical violence, of Ian beating Stevie, with rage he never thinks to control and that Hill doesn’t think to explain. Stevie finally lashes out at Ian, calling him a “fucking lonely faggot,” before receiving a thrashing in return that pushes him over the edge. It’s a shame that Hill never plumbs the prodigious emotional range that Lucas Hedges drew on more productively in “Manchester by the Sea” and “Lady Bird.” While they play video games, Ian says off-handedly of their mother, “She was a lot different when I was a little kid than when you were a little kid…guys like that comin’ in and out all the time,” to which Stevie replies, “Fuck Mom.” Ian’s face crumples in muted disbelief at how Stevie’s changing, indicating for the first time a pensiveness that Hill never explores.
It seems that making a good film is easier than making an enjoyable one. Aesthetically, Hill’s movie seems to meet standards for a superficially impressive film. The soundtrack fit the mood of each scene: Wooden flute sounds with a bass undersong complement the languid confidence with which Fuckshit walks into a house party, as if he were listening to a pump-up soundtrack. When simmering tensions bubble over into fistfights, the camera channels a teenager’s gaze and romanticizes the fight scenes through a warm filter. Hill masterfully captures emotional expression in teenage idiom, which is to say, indirections, or what would in lesser films be heavy-handed, quotable platitudes. Ray declares, the inklings of disillusionment apparent in his face, “I’m trying to get out the hood and see shit,” and resolves to skateboard professionally. Fourth Grade dreams of making movies, but decides, with a resignation that’s tinged with a sense of doom, “I guess I’ll just go to work at the DMV with my dad.” Ray hints at their personal and unresolved problems obliquely, mentions that Fourth Grade is too poor to afford socks, and that his own younger brother was hit by a car and killed. The boys skateboard and idle for the entirety of the film, but who do they go home to? Not to mention Stevie and Ian’s intriguingly vacant and glaringly underdeveloped mother. It’s unfortunate that Hill teases with references to a more colorful universe of characters outside this stunted snapshot of a story, to the dynamics that would make his own central characters more complex. It’s unfortunate that it’s all talk.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Members of the Harvard community, I’m reaching out about my recent proposal to tax the endowments of the wealthiest universities in our state.
I’m Jay Gonzalez, the Democratic nominee for Governor of Massachusetts. I’m running for Governor to take on the big challenges we face and make Massachusetts a leader again.
Today, too many working families are being left behind. We have a public education system that is failing too many young people. Our transportation system is among the worst in the country and impacts our quality of life every day as we are stuck in traffic or on disabled trains. Yet Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 is satisfied with the status quo.
I’m not. That’s why I’ve proposed investing significant new resources into our education and transportation systems, starting with a modest tax on the robust endowments of the wealthiest private colleges and universities in Massachusetts.
As Governor, I’d file legislation to raise an additional $1 billion annually through a 1.6 percent tax on the value of endowments exceeding $1 billion. There are currently nine colleges and universities impacted with combined endowments totaling over $65 billion. Harvard University has a $39 billion endowment and does not pay income tax. One report estimated that Harvard University, with an endowment of more than $30 billion, received the equivalent of $48,000 in taxpayer subsidies for each of its 6,700 undergraduate students. I strongly believe we need to do more to help students attending our public colleges and universities, particularly because they are the ones most likely to stay and live in Massachusetts after graduation.
Some have pushed back, saying that Harvard’s robust endowment is used to fund financial aid to needy students. To put that argument in perspective, Harvard and other wealthy universities pay more in endowment management fees than they invest in scholarships for low-income students.
And even after Harvard and other universities invest endowment resources in financial aid and all of the important work they do, their endowments have still grown at an average annual rate of 4.8 to 8.4 percent over the last 15 years. Therefore, a modest tax of 1.6 percent should allow Harvard to keep doing everything it does today while still growing its endowment at a rate that far exceeds inflation.
I understand that this proposal comes at a time when higher education institutions feel under siege. Admissions policies are being challenged, competition for students and faculty is intense and growing internationally, and President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress attack, rather than support, your community.
I want to be clear: I support and appreciate you and the incredible institution you work for and attend. We’re fortunate to have Harvard University in Massachusetts. It helps drive our knowledge-based and innovation-oriented economy. But as important as Harvard and the other impacted colleges and universities are to our state, our most important asset is our people. I am running for Governor to make a difference for all the working families being left behind. The people of Massachusetts are my top priority.
I know it’s controversial. But we all have an obligation to ensure that we are building an economy that works for everyone in our state, not just those at the top. My endowment tax proposal is fair, and it’s the right thing to do. The new tax revenue will result in a better-educated and more mobile workforce, a stronger economy, and a better quality of life for working families being left behind.
Jay Gonzalez is the Democratic nominee for Governor of Massachusetts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This coming November, Massachusetts voters will be called on to vote on three ballot measures. The first concerns nurse-patient ratios in Massachusetts hospitals. Specifically, it calls for a legal limitation on the number of patients assigned to each nurse, though this limit would vary based on the conditions of each hospital unit. While there are many valid arguments on both sides of this debate, voters should vote no on this referendum, and any reforms in this area should be made by legislators who are informed by healthcare experts.
This ballot question could have huge implications, for better or for worse. It may be true that California, the only state to have successfully executed such a measure, saw no clear link between staffing ratios and increased quality of care in California hospitals, according to research conducted by the University of California, San Francisco. However, the Health Policy Commission — an independent state agency — estimates that the passing of this referendum in Massachusetts will cost between 676 million to 949 million dollars per year. Thus, this decision could result in an increase in insurance premiums. At the same time, research from UCSF concluded that in California, nurses saw improved pay, lower burnout, and lower injury rate.
Nevertheless, while the effects of this ballot measure could be large and numerous, so are its complexities. Healthcare is one of this country’s most complex and controversial issues. As a result, it does not seem wise to give the general public, most of whom will not have any expertise regarding healthcare issues, ultimate power to enact this measure into law. Indeed, more time and a more in-depth analysis of the implications of this ballot measure are required to make an informed decision.
It is lawmakers who should discuss this important issue. When they do, we hope that the concerns of nursing unions are given serious credence. Nurses are extremely important to both the proper functioning of hospitals and society at large; the work they do is vital and irreplaceable. As such, their voices and any suggestions they may have to improve their and their patients livelihoods should be seriously considered.
Although we are calling for voters to vote no on this ballot measure, we are not calling for the dismissal of this issue, but rather that it be given more careful consideration by legislators —  who can improve and amend it. Because of the complexity of healthcare issues, the general public is not able to make a well-informed decision.
For a proper discussion around this important issue, vote no on Ballot Question One.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
How would you describe Harvard students? Those aspiring to join our ranks might call us smart, the best and the brightest. We might like to think of ourselves as ambitious and hardworking. After three years on this campus, I Iament the reality unbeknownst to or ignored by both parties: Harvard students are exceptionally rude.
Before enrolling here, I knew just as much about Harvard as the average American who’s seen Legally Blonde three times: diddly squat. For example, I thought wealthy students would keep their dorms tidy. Getting paid to clean up their mold-laden bedrooms and piss-stained bathrooms that had seen more rat feces than Febreze taught me otherwise. Similarly, I assumed training through boarding schools, country clubs, and cotillions would produce well-mannered undergrads.
This past August, I returned to campus after eight months away. As I toted moving boxes to my dorm, doors were slammed in my face and couldn’t-be-bothered-to-help bystanders greeted me upon my arrival. While I scanned my surroundings in a search for basic human decency, I could practically hear my peers saying, “Those boxes look heavy. Lol, have fun!”
I hold doors open for people all the time. Not in a radical act of feminism or to upend gender roles; I just think it’s a nice thing to do. It’s also a revealing social phenomenon, as I typically receive one of two responses. First: no acknowledgement of the act, no “thank you,” which seems to be a taboo in Harvard vernacular. Second: an overwhelming gratitude — a degree of gratitude typically reserved for a higher power — because such an act never happens here.
Harvard students’ lack of manners pops up on all corners of campus, in every form of action. There’s the classic “acting brand new,” when people like to pretend that they don’t know you. It doesn’t matter that you’ve shared the womb with someone; some impenetrable force requires Harvard students to evade eye contact with you and refuse to say hello. Don’t bother providing an oral history of every class and extracurricular you’ve been in together — they’ll still introduce themselves to you as if you’re just meeting for the first time.
The signature Harvard misbehavior occurs in matters involving commitment. In life’s bakery, Harvard students are croissants: typically European in origin, but more importantly, supremely flaky. With them, there’s little use in setting a date and time for plans; your planner will become most useful when thrown into a fire, heating your flaked-on self.
Harvard students show up late to and skip events as they please, often using the excuses of being busy — as if no one else were — and self-care, which purportedly absolves us of any responsibility. Such excuses preclude reflection of what disregarding other people’s needs might say about our character and degree of selfishness. They disguise inconsideration under the alleged intention of being kind to oneself.
Any kindness we exhibit on this campus is selective. If and only if you can advance my social status, get me a job, or pose as my attractive friend in Instagram photos, I will deign to treat you nicely. Otherwise, a mere smile, “Hello!”, or even acknowledgement of the space you occupy is too much to ask.
Why are Harvard students so rude? Does extending courtesy demand too much time or effort? Most of us aren’t busy as we and our flamboyant Google Calendars like to suggest. I routinely see people who claim constant occupation engaged in needless activity: wasting hours on social media, collecting dust in the dining hall, or eating their boogers in the library. I imagine the resolute dedication to disregarding basic human decency requires far more emotional investment than exhibiting manners does.
Entitlement runs rampant on this campus. We feel entitled to admission to exclusive organizations, internships, and job opportunities. We feel entitled to other people giving us time and attention. But that entitlement seems to be a one way street that serves to allow us to neglect and de-prioritize any action that seemingly doesn’t meet our immediate self interest. Although treating people with respect and acting cordially may create a healthy social ecosystem, 0ur self-centeredness prevents us from valuing that.
The solution is simple: be nicer! I suggest this quick fix with the understanding that doing so might be contrary to the Harvard ethic. The preamble to the Harvard constitution seems to read “We the opportunistic people,” which makes students weary of aiding anyone who cannot immediately return the favor. Experience may have led you to believe that you don’t build a Harvard-worthy resume without letting a few doors slam in your peers’ faces along the way. Kindness and ambition might seem mutually exclusive, the former costly in a competitive world.
Even if the actions don’t stem from the kindness of your heart, take the time to acknowledge people and find ways to make their lives a little easier and brighter. Fake it ‘til you make it — even if you follow these steps and feel like a cold-hearted fraud, crook, or nincompoop, you can at least put “well-versed in basic human decency” on your resume. I’ll even endorse your skills in “manners” and “acting” on LinkedIn.

Carmen Yulín Cruz , mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, was honored as the Phillips Brooks House Association’s 12th Annual Robert Coles “Call of Service” Lecturer & Awardee at Memorial Church Friday evening.
Cruz, who garnered national attention for her criticisms of the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria in 2017, is the first Latina woman to receive this public service honor.
In her lecture, Cruz described the hurricane’s devastation, condemned the federal government’s “neglect” of the island, and urged the audience to “tell the inconvenient truth” and serve those who are suffering during humanitarian crises.
During the program, Mayor of Cambridge Marc C. McGovern presented Cruz with a key to the City of Cambridge. His introduced his fellow mayor, citing her advocacy for marginalized groups including the BGLTQ and deaf communities.
“I’m a social worker in my background, and seeing the way that—just your passion and the way that you treat people in your community is wonderful,” McGovern said. “I think there are a few folks down in DC who might learn a thing or two from you.”
The festivities also included a bomba and spoken poetry performance celebrating Puerto Rican culture, and a special guest: Robert Coles ’50, a professor emeritus, author, and psychiatrist for whom the event is named, was in attendance and received a standing ovation.
Cruz described Hurricane Maria's impact in Puerto Rico as something that “no human being should have to experience.”
“We experienced darkness. We experienced hatred. We experienced discrimination and literally were left to die,” Cruz said. “‘Somebody help us,’ was my cry. I am begging you. Mayday. S.O.S. We are dying here. And you are killing us with your bureaucracy and your inefficiency.”
Both deep emotion and light-hearted joy characterized the evening. Cruz’s voice cracked audibly while describing Puerto Rico’s lack of clean bathrooms and textbooks for school children, and she also twice led the audience into song with Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” and Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror.”
After the event, Cruz said she remained optimistic for a more compassionate approach to policy-making.
“We are living in difficult times, but everywhere you look, there are people willing to do what it takes to change them, and to make them inclusive, and to have diversity be at the forefront of the way that they make policies,” Cruz said. “We all have to find a way to join together and have a big caravan of hope that will lead us into pushing agencies that are for the common good.”
After audience member Adebola S. Yakubu-Owolewa ’05 asked Cruz if she had considered running for the presidency in 2020, Cruz explained that her birth in a U.S. territory disqualified her from seeking that office. Even if she could, Cruz said, the job would not interest her.
“I wouldn’t want that job,” she said. “Sometimes the higher you go in office the more distant you are from the people.”
Yakubu-Owolewa said that she felt Cruz’s work with marginalized communities would have made her a strong candidate.
“In the U.S., or anywhere, you only are going to treat people as well as you treat the most marginalized and vulnerable people. She has seen that in Puerto Rico, and she has fought tirelessly,” Yakubu-Owolewa said.
The “Call of Service” Lecture & Award kicked off PBHA’s annual alumni weekend, which also honored the Harvard Square Homeless Shelter Corporation, Massachusetts Representative Byron D. Rushing ’64, and poet José G. Olivarez ’10.
Michael C. A. Leonard ’17, nonprofit management fellow and project manager of the lecture and award, said that the decision to honor Cruz was confirmed this August.
“We do a long selection and ranking process and reach out to our candidates after that. There are students and staff in the room and we try our best to reach a consensus,” Leonard said. “It was pretty easy this year.”
Cruz said that she hopes to continue collaboration and contact with PBHA.
“Often, whenever we go to a particular place, something sparks up a light that allows us to make connections and go back, so we go back, we take a look at them and then try to reconnect,” Cruz said. “But certainly, the Phillips Brooks House initiative is something that we’d like to kind of copy and see how we can do alliances with them to move forward.”

Eighty-four College seniors interviewed with 21 nonprofit organizations during the College's fifth annual Public Service Recruitment Day, held at the Student Organization Center at Hilles Friday.
The recruitment program received 261 applications from 147 students, and was able to offer 120 interviews with various public service organizations, Travis Lovett, director of the Center for Public Interest Careers, said. Around 27 percent of participating students in last year’s program eventually received a job offer from an organization they interviewed with. Public Service Recruitment Day was organized by the Phillips Brooks House, CPIC, the Office of Career Services, and the Institute of Politics.
The event was designed to mimic the recruitment practices of finance and consulting firms in order to provide students with a clearer path into a public service job, Lovett said. In an OCS survey given to the Class of 2018, 22 percent of graduating seniors said they planned to work for non-profits or the government — compared to seventy-two percent planning to pursue for-profit jobs — and University President Lawrence S. Bacow has emphasized the importance of students entering public service.
Many public sector organizations, howerver, hire on a just-in-time hiring model, and sometimes cannot make job offers to students until late spring or early summer, whereas the private sector has the financial resources to recruit in the fall.
Even for students genuinely interested in public sector opportunities, Lovett said the late timeline can pose difficulties.
“For many students, waiting until that point can be pretty challenging. It’s especially stressful for a lot of our first generation college students, or students that have high financial need.”
During its first two years, the recruiting event brought in organizations that were interested in hiring recent graduates, but may not have had concrete job offerings, making it more difficult for students to find a secure position.
“We’ve been more deliberate about trying to identify more competitive programs and trying to identify organizations that do have explicit hiring needs that will set students up for success,” Lovett said.
The Attollo Leadership Fellows, for instance, was looking for talented people rather than just hiring on an as-needed basis, CEO Jordan S. Steffy said.
“If we find the right fits and there’s three of them we’ll make three offers. If we find 15 of them we’ll make 15 offers,” Steffy said.
After last year's Public Service Recruitment Day, Nicholas J. Abbott ’18 was selected by the San Francisco Fellows program. Now his role has swapped, and he returned to interview and recruit current seniors interested in public service.
“Private sector companies do a great job of recruiting here on campus,” Abbott said. “I think it’s really great the OCS and CPIC and others have tried to model public service recruiting off of that structure so that people earlier in the year can find out about those opportunities.”
Lovett said career paths in public service are rarely straightforward.
“The pathways are pretty murky to navigate. People discover nonprofit work or public interest work in such a variety of ways that it is challenging to navigate one individual pathway," he said.
Several students participating in the event said they were aware they likely would not receive immediate job offers from the day.
“It’s more of a way to encounter new opportunities and get information,” Haley S. Elliott ’19 said. “I think it was very much a ‘do you have questions for me?’ kind of thing.”
Jingjing Z. Zhu ’19 said the event introduced her to organizations she was not familiar with before.
“A 30 minute conversation, someone who can be that connection for you as you try to apply to the organization, I think definitely is helpful," she said.
Lovett said CPIC is excited to continue running Public Service Recruitment Day.
“As we learn each year, we’ve made incremental improvements every year. And I think that’s going to lead to more job offers," he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before University administrators and members of Harvard’s graduate student union can begin debating the finer points of their historic first contract, they will have to settle a more basic point: identifying who, exactly, is in the union.
Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers’s roughly 5,000-member bargaining unit comprises graduate and undergraduate teaching and research assistants. As course staffs and lab assignments change, so does the size and composition of the union — a challenge both Harvard and union leadership face as they continue their inaugural contract negotiations, which began earlier this month.
In order to decide what contract proposals are feasible, both sides need to know how many students will be affected. Harvard is required to provide the union with updated lists of eligible students throughout the semester — a task University administrators say can be challenging.
Even after undergraduates decide on their class schedules, graduate students’ teaching and research commitments can remain in flux; the classes they teach and the labs they work at can change well into the semester.
This summer, in advance of negotiations, the union’s bargaining committee requested a series of documents from the Office of Labor and Employee Relations, a list of HGSU-UAW members among them. The list took months to generate, largely because of the complexity of the bargaining unit, and administrators only produced it in early October.
In an email, Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran pointed to differences across programs, semester-to-semester changes, and varying terminology between schools as factors complicating his office’s effort to produce a comprehensive list.
In many Ph.D. programs in the humanities and social sciences, for example, students begin their teaching requirements only after years of taking classes. In the sciences, however, students often begin lab research in the first months of their doctoral program.
“The HGSU-UAW bargaining unit is unique: while its members are now considered employees of the university, up until now they have exclusively been considered students,” Curran wrote. “The new employment categories are of short duration, and students often fill different temporary positions over the course of their academic training at Harvard.”
Harvard and the grad union have tussled over the exact composition of the bargaining unit before.
After the University’s first graduate student unionization election, held in Nov. 2016, HGSU-UAW appealed the vote on the grounds that the voter list the University provided was insufficient. That appeal prompted the National Labor Relations Board to throw out the result and mandate that Harvard hold a second election.
In the run-up to the second election, union supporters and University administrators clashed over the voter list yet again, disagreeing on how much time the University should have to generate the roster.
This time, though, HGSU-UAW bargaining committee member Ege Yumusak ’16 wrote in an email that the union is “confident that we have a good sense of who is working in our bargaining unit, including fluctuations from semester to semester.”
“Only Harvard can produce a totally accurate and inclusive list of who is working, therefore good-faith bargaining obligates them to respond to reasonable requests by the union for such information,” she wrote. “As part of our current negotiations, we have been working with Harvard to obtain this and other information that will help facilitate the bargaining process.”
Even with an agreed-upon members’ list, experts say contract negotiations will likely last for months. Union organizers wrote in a Facebook post on Oct. 25 that they will return to Curran’s office on Mount Auburn Street for a second half-day of negotiations in November.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four alumni of the Harvard Graduate School of Education discussed their experiences grappling with political and economic challenges facing international education at a forum Friday.
About a hundred people packed into Longfellow Hall for the event, which was part of the Graduate School of Education’s Askwith Forum — a series of public lectures centered on obstacles facing the education industry in the 21st century. The panelists featured officials from both government and non-governmental organizations that specialize in international education policy.
Fernando M. Reimers, a professor at the Graduate School of Education who moderated the event, opened the panel with remarks on the “global significance” of education in a time when he said some people doubt its value.
“We live in times in which some people question the global nature of humanity’s shared work in improving the world,” Reimers said. “There’s a new form of national populism with xenophobic undertones that suggests that to be a globalist is antithetical to caring for local communities or nations.”
In her opening remarks, LeAnna L. Marr, an education expert and official at the United States Agency for International Development, said although policy frameworks surrounding education and foreign aid vary by administration, the industries continue to receive funding from the government.
“Education still retains high bipartisan support, especially from Congress,” Marr said.
But two other panelists — former Deputy Minister of Education in Colombia Luis E. Garcia de Brigard and World Bank analyst Myra M. Khan — said governments and powerful organizations are not doing enough to support global education and leadership.
Garcia de Brigard argued that governments are not placing sufficient emphasis on teaching lessons of global citizenship and leadership.
“[Governments] need to be brave enough to put in place the incentive systems that are actually aligned with what we’re hoping for,” he said.
Khan described her experience at the World Bank, where she said she saw other sectors such as agriculture and energy receive more funding than education.
“A lot [of] our big international financial institutions don’t actually put their money where their mouth is,” Khan said.
Khan spoke about the need to fund education around the world, specifically citing girls’ education as an area of concern.
“You need a lot more money. You need a lot more people in education. And you just need a lot more people starting their own organizations and bringing that kind of fire and passion and complete commitment to getting stuff done,” she said. “It’s clearly not enough right now.”
The panel also included Wilson I. Aiwuyor, who worked in the Department of Education under the Obama administration, who said there is “no single solution” to solving global challenges in education.
Cécile Guédon, a lecturer in Comparative Literature who attended the event, said the panelists introduced her to thinking in a global context and she felt “very inspired.”
“I’m really wondering about the themes of global citizenship, it’s not something we’re supposed to be thinking about very much in our practice here,” she said. “I care a lot about giving my students the tools to address larger audiences than merely academia, but I had never considered the global stage as one that I should engage with.”
Graduate School of Education student Melissa Donovan said it was invigorating to see alumni speak about how their education at Harvard helped them make an impact in their respective careers.
“It was great to hear, as a student in the [International Education] program, to see the diverse experiences that people have had who have gone through this program and have all taken very different paths toward the same goal of improving the quality and relevance of education abroad,” Donovan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council voted against establishing two programs at its Sunday meeting, one which would have funded dinners in Harvard Square to help sophomores decide on a concentration, and the other which would have funded student-led advising trips to Boston.
Each initiative would have taken $4,800 from the Student Life Committee’s budget.
The first program proposed providing 40 groups of six students each — four sophomores considering a concentration and two upperclassmen already enrolled in that concentration — with money to eat at a restaurant of their choice in Harvard Square.
Sixteen representatives voted in favor of the measure, while 27 voted against, and one abstained.
The other program would have funded 20 outings into Boston for groups of freshmen and seniors. The trips would have been designed to allow seniors to provide “formal” and “informal” advising for the freshmen, as well as to give seniors the opportunity to reflect on their time at Harvard. The final tally was 18 votes in favor, 21 against, and two abstaining.
Some representatives questioned the merits of the advising initiative, saying it was not an efficient or equitable way to offer mentorship and reflection programs.
Dunster House Representative Victor C. Agbafe ’19 said he preferred the Council support existing student groups focused on advising, arguing the UC program could pose a “logistical nightmare” to organize effectively.
“I don’t know if the UC in this situation is the best angle to provide mentorship,” he said. “Let’s work with different student groups because people have common bonds through those groups.”
Adams House Representative K. Yu-Mi Kim ’20 agreed the proposed initiative would not prove to be a useful allocation of student funds.
“At the end of the day, I don’t think this addresses advising and this is mostly just redistributing money into students’ pockets,” she said. “Basically, the $60 dollars that students pay, we’re just giving it back to them and giving them less freedom.”
Finance committee leaders also announced at the meeting that for the second consecutive week, they had not imposed an across-the-board cut to their weekly grants to student groups, a welcome development after a rocky spring semester which saw the Council tap into its “emergency fund” to shore up the committee's finances.
The committee is operating with a roughly 15 percent higher budget than the spring, partly a result of the 150 percent increase to the student activities fee this year, an optional sum Harvard undergraduates pay as part of enrollment costs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike in admissions cycles past, Harvard officials will abide by specific, written guidelines detailing how and when they may consider an applicant’s race when deciding whether to admit that student to the College's Class of 2023 this year.
A copy of the guidelines obtained by The Crimson — in which Harvard outlines application "reading procedures" for the Class of 2023 — explicitly prohibits officers from pondering a candidate's race when assigning scores for personal traits. The admissions office releases a new set of reading procedures to officers each year, though normally the documents remain confidential.
The way the College assigns personal ratings is a key point of conflict in the ongoing Harvard admissions trial, the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit alleging the University discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Anti-affirmative action advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions first sued Harvard in Nov. 2014; in the years since, it has specifically alleged that the College systematically assigns qualified Asian-American applicants lower personal scores to justify their exclusion.
As revealed in documents submitted as part of the suit, Harvard admissions officers give each applicant a score for their personality traits that ranges from 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest and 4 the lowest score. A 1 denotes an applicant with “truly outstanding qualities of character” while applicants with “questionable or worrisome qualities of character” are more likely to earn a 4.
A 2013 internal review conducted by Harvard’s Office of Institutional Research found that Asian-American applicants consistently drew lower personal ratings than did applicants of other races. Harvard officials have repeatedly called the report “preliminary and limited.”
While the new guidelines prohibit the use of race when determining personal scores, the documents also urge officers to consider whether a student’s racial or ethnic background “may contribute to the educational benefits of diversity at Harvard College” when assigning overall scores.
“The consideration of race or ethnicity may be considered only as one factor among many,” the guidelines read.
Previous iterations of these guidelines contained no explicit guidance on the use of race. Previous versions also offered far shorter explanations of how Harvard gives out personal scores.
Director of Admissions Marlyn C. McGrath ’70 said the admissions office does not give application readers with written guidance on the consideration of race when she took the witness stand in the trial Oct. 19.
Most documents examined in the case — and used in McGrath’s testimony — all date to several years ago. The admissions office drafted the new guidelines for the Class of 2023 in early October.
University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in an email that the new reading procedures comprise a yearly update to Harvard’s admissions policies, which remain unchanged. She declined to comment on the fact that the procedures explicitly mention race.
"Harvard College’s admissions policies remain the same, the reading procedures are reissued annually and 2023 procedures are this year’s version,” Cowenhoven wrote.
This year's revised reading procedures also provide detailed instructions on how to assign the controversial personal ratings.
The added instructions emphasize that admissions officers should consier “characteristics not always synonymous with extroversion” and that “particularly reflective” or “insightful” applicants should earn higher personal ratings.
SFFA lawyers introduced the reading procedures in court Wednesday after Tia M. Ray ’12, a Harvard admissions officer and director of the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, testified under cross-examination that she was aware the College had published written guidelines on the usage of race in the admissions process .
The revised reading procedures merely “enforced what we have been doing in practice” and are “absolutely not” a change in the admissions process, Ray said.
In earlier testimony, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 affirmed that Harvard has not, in recent history, relied on race when calculating the personal ranking.
“We do not endorse, we abhor, stereotypical comments. This is not part of our process,” he said. “This is not who I am, and this is not who our admissions committee members are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University affiliates gathered at Harvard Hillel Sunday evening to support each other and to honor the victims of the deadly mass shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue over the weekend.
Close to 100 individuals — Jewish and non-Jewish alike — packed into the vigil to pay their respects to the 11 victims of Saturday’s tragedy. Students gathered in front of the room and called out the names of the dead, lighting a candle for each one as the crowd stood silently and watched.
Rabbi Dani Passow spoke first, holding back tears as he shared a story from the book of Genesis. He described how God instructed Abraham to kill his son Isaac before an angel stopped the doting father at the last second. Passow said the parable played itself out in synagogues across the world Saturday morning.
“In every synagogue that re-lived this story, the angel cried out and Isaac was saved. In every synagogue but one,” Passow said. “Since then, millions and millions of Isaacs have been slaughtered. May these be the last of Isaac’s ashes that lay on the altar.”
The shooting took place Saturday at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Penn., claiming the lives of 11 worshipers and wounding six others. Witnesses said the shooter yelled anti-Semitic statements before he opened fire, according to the Washington Post.
Prosecutors charged the shooter with 29 counts of federal civil rights crimes Saturday night. The shooting is the deadliest-ever attack perpetrated against Jews on American soil.
At the vigil Sunday, University president Lawrence S. Bacow — wearing a white kippah — took a few moments to speak on the tragedy and how the nation can move forward.
“We can do more than simply comfort each other,” Bacow said. “We can vote for those who would bring us together as opposed to those who would divide us.”
Bacow also said the tragedy affects everyone, regardless of religion or identity.
“This was not simply a crime against Jews,” Bacow said. “It was a crime against all who stand for social justice. It was a crime against all people of faith.”
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana also stood to address the vigial attendees. He spoke about voting and politics, saying at one point that he does not “want to live in a society that loves its guns more than its babies.” He ended his speech with a call to action.
“Today we grieve, tomorrow we start working for change,” Khurana said. “We must do both.”
Amitai B. Abouzaglo ’20, who attended the vigil, said he hopes the Pittsburgh shooting is not the sole reason people go to the polls on Nov. 6.
“Everyone was saying four months ago ‘You better vote. You want to do something? You better vote. You better do something.’ Don’t make us the altar,” he said.
While the shooting occurred hundreds of miles away, some students said the events Saturday “hit home” for Harvard affiliates who practice the Jewish faith.
Attendee Ilan M. Goldberg ’20, who serves as vice president of community relations for Hillel, said he's been pondering the historical weight and resonance of the tragedy. In an interview after the vigil, Goldberg said that — as someone whose family came to the United States from Mexico for “safety and in part for better opportunities" — the events Saturday were hghly unsettling.
“I think we’d seen acts of anti-Semitism, swastikas, and maybe anti-Semitic talks and posts, and that kind of thing, but this really was the first and hopefully the last act of mass violence against the Jewish community in the United States,” Goldberg said.
Vice President of Tikkun Olam at Hillel Paulette K. Schuster ’20 said the tragedy in Pittsburgh felt personal due to her family history.
“My grandfather was a Holocaust survivor and the rest of my family came to here — to Canada — for exactly the religious safety that Ilan mentioned,” Schuster said. “I think as generations go, it’s easier to feel more and more secure, and this was a very, very startling reminder for the community that that’s not always the case.”
Several Faculty Deans across the College sent emails to their students in the wake of the shooting to publicize the Sunday vigil and to encourage those who felt affected by events to reach out to House administrators and tutors for support.
“We stand strong in our denunciation of the cowardly act of violence that resulted in the loss of so many innocent lives,” Winthrop Faculty Deans Ronald S. Sullivan Jr. and Stephanie Robinson wrote in an email to House residents. “We stand in solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters.”
Reflecting on the heightened emotion and strong bonds between those gathered in the room, Goldberg said he was grateful for those who attended the vigil Sunday evening.
“I want to just say thank you to all of the communities that came out to support us today,” he said. “We can do a lot to support each other within the community, but an event like this really causes people to turn inwards and it’s been incredible to feel the pull of the outside in a positive way, the other people lifting us up.”
Correction: Oct. 29, 2018
A previous version of this article misquoted Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana. He told attendees at the vigil that "Today is a time to grieve," not "breathe."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A demographic report at the Harvard Kennedy School last year provoked outrage when it revealed the school was mostly white and male and struggles to recruit and retain minorities. A year later, that remains the case, according to the latest data.
The data, released to Kennedy School affiliates in a four-page report Thursday, indicates little change in the low numbers of underrepresented minorities who attend, teach, and work at the school.
“The report shows that the Kennedy School community is not as diverse along various dimensions as it should be in order to achieve full excellence in our mission,” Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf wrote in an email introducing the report. “We are not satisfied with the current situation and are committed to taking further steps to improve diversity, as well as inclusion and belonging.”
The Kennedy School last collected internal data on the demographics of its students, faculty, and staff as part of a task force on diversity in 2017. A draft report of the data, leaked to the press, presented stark statistics: African-American and Latinx faculty members numbered in the single digits, women made up less than a third of faculty members, and the yield rate among African- American students was declining, among other findings.
Addressing the lack of faculty diversity it found, the 2017 report read, “Without that diversity, we risk taking narrow views on policy issues important to our students and to the world and to missing important issues altogether.”
Its findings sparked protests and conversations among students and faculty about the dearth of minorities and women at the school. Acting on the recommendations from the report, the school hired Dean of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Robbin Chapman and instituted bias trainings for senior administrators.
Still, a year later, the numbers have hardly budged. According to the latest demographic report, men represented 53 percent of the student body and 71 percent of the faculty — nearly the same percentages as in the 2017 report. Women maintained a significant majority among staff, making up again 70 percent of staffers at HKS.
The 2018 report — which only examines U.S. citizens at the school — also provided a breakdown of the demographics of each degree program. In the Masters in Public Policy program, the largest the school offers, the percentage of African-American students increased from 4 percent in 2015 to 7 percent in 2018. Last year’s report found that students who identified as Hispanic constituted 7 percent of the student body in 2015; in 2018, “Hispanic/Latinx” students made up the same proportion.
The number of Asian-American students pursuing the MPP degree, however, increased noticeably between this year and last. In the 2017 report, Asian Americans made up 7 percent of MPP students, whereas the 2018 report showed Asian-American students represented 17 percent of students.
Chapman said the dean and senior staff — the team which produced this inaugural public report — could not explain the jump.
“That’s part of the work we are going to be doing moving forward,” Chapman said.
The faculty data showed even less of a shift from previous reports. In the 2018 report, 79 percent of professors identified as white. Only one professor identified as “Hispanic/Latinx,” and the report said two professors are Black or African American.
Elmendorf wrote in his email to HKS affiliates that the 2018 report followed a recommendation from the 2017 task force to conduct follow up studies. He said administrators plan to update these reports “each fall,” and Chapman said the school will release demographic breakdowns every October moving forward.
Several Kennedy School affiliates said the very existence of the report shows the school’s commitment to improving diversity at the school.
“The timing of the report was really important because as students, a lot of us have continued meeting on diversity, equity, and inclusion issues,” Kennedy School Latinx Caucus Co-Chair Amanda R. Matos said. “For us, it was timely in the sense that we have a lot planned for this year to make sure that this is still on our administration’s radar.”
Some students pointed to what they consider to be several flaws in the report’s methodology.
HKS Black Student Union President Akina E. Younge said she was “happy” to have concrete numbers but is still concerned about the details of the report.
“I think that’s really important that we have data and information that we can all talk about,” Younge said. “That doesn’t mean that the data is completely correct or representative.”
Specifically, Younge worried the inclusion of students who are completing dual degrees at other Harvard graduate schools inflated the numbers of minorities — rendering the data less representative of the Kennedy School’s full-time student population.
“By including the joint degree [students], it means that, if the purpose is to tell us what the experience is like for people on campus, it’s not actually doing that because this isn’t representing the folks and the experiences of being on campus if we’re including people who are not on campus and who are not in the classroom with us,” she said.
Chapman said the number of students completing joint degrees is “very small compared to the overall number of students” and did not “skew” the data.
HKS Professor Khalil G. Muhammad said the report showed “room for improvement,” especially because it did not contain demographic or admissions data collected from previous years. The document presented only statistics from 2018.
“I’m surprised that this report, if it is the final template, does not reflect historical data. It seems to be a moment in time report,” Muhammad said. “It seems to be the only way to measure progress or retrogression over time is to actually see what's happened in prior years, and this report doesn’t have that.”
In light of the numbers, Elmendorf wrote that the school has begun expanding student recruitment to include more candidates from diverse backgrounds and is “revisiting” the procedures for faculty searches to “de-bias selection processes.”
Still, while racial and ethnic minorities remain very much in the minority, Matos said it is difficult to be confronted with that reality.
“No matter how often I think and breathe and live about issues tied to race and ethnicity, it is still no matter what, very jarring to see when for me, as a person of color, sometimes called a minority, seeing myself reflected in small numbers,” Matos said. “It hits my heart in a way I can never fully be prepared for.”

In the coming months, tens of thousands of Harvard hopefuls around the globe will grit their teeth, cross their fingers, and click “Submit” on applications to attend the world’s top-ranked university.
The vast majority will fail. Harvard — the second-most selective four-year college in the United States — typically sees an acceptance rate of about 5 percent.
But this year’s crop of high school dreamers have an advantage their predecessors did not: an inside understanding of how the College decides who qualifies as Harvard material.
This year’s application cycle comes soon after the high-stakes and high-profile Harvard admissions trial that spurred the release of previously confidential documents and data shedding unprecedented light on the inner workings of the College’s admissions process.
The trial, which kicked off Oct. 15 in the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston, marks the latest development in a four-year-old lawsuit alleging Harvard discriminates against Asian-American applicants. For the past two weeks, lawyers for the University and Students for Fair Admissions — the anti-affirmative action advocacy group that sued Harvard in Nov. 2014 — have traveled to court every day to debate the legality of race-conscious admissions.
The trial is slated to end Friday, but experts have predicted a cascading series of appeals will bring the case before the Supreme Court. If it does, it could mean the end of affirmative action in America as we know it.
Regardless of how the nation’s highest court rules, one thing is certain: Harvard’s super-secret admissions process is secret no longer. Documents made public over the summer and in court across the past two weeks unravel what University lawyer William F. Lee ’72 once called “the secret of Coke.”
The early decision application deadline for the Class of 2023 is Nov. 1 and the regular decision deadline falls on Jan. 1. As students pore over their transcripts and put the finishing touches on their personal essays, here’s a run-down of what they can expect to happen next — and how the Harvard admissions process really works.
Harvard’s admissions office starts thinking about prospective applicants well before many high schoolers start thinking about the College.
Things typically kick off when Harvard purchases students’ test scores and contact information from standardized testing companies such as the College Board and ACT Inc., which administer the SAT and the ACT, respectively.
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 testified in court Oct. 17 that the University buys information for “well in excess of 100,000” students each year.
“It’s a good start,” Fitzsimmons said.
The College uses this data to identify “accomplished students” and then floods their inboxes and mailboxes with emails, letters, and shiny booklets stuffed with glossy photos of Harvard’s campus. Sometimes, the College starts recruiting promising applicants as early as freshman year of high school, according to the 2013-2014 iteration of the Harvard Admissions Office interviewer handbook.

Next, admissions officers put rubber to the road to seek out candidates across the country. Sometimes alone and sometimes traveling alongside representatives from other top-tier schools — such as the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University — Harvard officials trekked to 130 cities in all 50 states in the 2013-2014 school year, the handbook states.
Once arrived, staffers typically rent out public spaces like hotel conference rooms and give presentations meant to explain the admissions process and advertise Harvard.
The College specifically targets low-income and minority students, as well as high schoolers hailing from less populous sections of America.
Via the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative and the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, College officials and undergraduates make a personal appeal to applicants. The admissions office contacts candidates individually by telephone and email. Students let high schoolers stay overnight in their dormitories on campus to give them a taste of Harvard life.
Admissions representatives also visit high schools and junior high schools. The 2013 handbook notes that staffers for the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program must travel to at least two junior high schools each.
Related: [Here's what happened in the Harvard admissions trial today]
The handbook argues the merits of in-person recruitment efforts.
“A friendly note or phone call to introduce the candidate from sparse county to Harvard can be an important first step,” the handbook states.
Admissions officers additionally seek students skilled enough to play a varsity sport at Harvard. According to the 2013 alumni interviewer guidelines, staffers sometimes recruit “prospect[s]” as early as the first day of high school.
Documents released as part of the lawsuit show that recruited athletes see a significant boost in the admissions process. In the past, Harvard has ranked its applicants’ academic prowess on a scale of 1 to 6; athletes who earned a score of 4 were 1,000 times more likely to win admittance to the College than were non-athletes who received the same score during admissions cycles stretching from the Class of 2014 to the Class of 2019.
Once recruitment season ends, it’s time for applicants to strut their stuff.
After each Harvard hopeful submits an online application — replete with test scores, transcripts, and personal essays — the vast majority of students sign up for an interview with a College alumnus tasked with evaluating the candidate. More than 15,000 Harvard graduates typically serve as alumni interviewers each year.
Until alumni meet their assigned interviewees face-to-face, they know only the basics: full name, phone number, email address, and high school. The interviewers never see the interviewees’ Harvard applications.
Nonetheless, each alumnus later produces a report evaluating the pros and cons of the high schooler they spent roughly 60 minutes getting to know. The interviewer handbook details what criteria the interviewers use to judge applicants — as well as the nitty-gritty of how Harvard wants these conversations to go down.
Related: [In first day of trial testimony, Khurana says it's okay Harvard skews wealthy]
The handbook instructs interviewers to keep the conversation under an hour and tells them not to suggest a dress code. It also advises against interviewing students in graduates’ homes.
“Some high school guidance counselors explicitly instruct their students to reject offers to meet alumni in their homes,” the document states. “In these cases you should happily suggest an alternative meeting location on neutral ground.”
During the interview, some topics are taboo. Alumni should “avoid prolonged discussions of political and personal issues” and “be wary” of asking where else applicants are applying, according to the handbook. If an interviewer chooses to ask about a student’s grades or test scores, they should do so in “a casual tone,” per the book.
“Your approach in asking for this information can help put candidates at ease and reassure them that grades and standardized test scores are by no means the only things the Admissions Committee considers,” the handbook states.
According to the 2013 guidelines, interviewers should start with easy-to-answer factual questions and slowly shift to a line of inquiry meant to unearth “motivation, commitment, and level and quality of contribution.”
The handbook suggests sample questions. One Harvard-proposed query asks applicants to describe their “school community” and speak about which classes they enjoy and do not enjoy.
Another asks, “Do you have a favorite book? Or, which book have you recently read? Do you prefer reading online? What blogs or sites do you read regularly?”
The document also details questions alumni should be asking themselves throughout the conversation. Interviewers should ponder an applicant’s “potential,” “maximum growth,” and “direction” while also considering the student’s intellectual and personal “capacity,” according to the handbook.
And interviewers should guess at the broader arc of candidates’ lives.
“Does the candidate have a direction yet? What is it? If not, is she exploring many things? Or is he just letting everything happen to him?” the document states. “Where will the candidate be in one year? Five years? Twenty-five years? Will she contribute something, somewhere, somehow?”
After the interview, alumni write up short blurbs detailing their interviewee’s strengths and shortcomings. Interviewers summarize the “special contribution” promising candidates could make on campus and how the students would benefit from a Harvard education.
The handbook cautions interviewers to “be aware of, and suspect, [their] own biases” when compiling these reports.
“Since no one can really be ‘objective’ in attempting to evaluate another person, be aware of your biases,” the handbook states. “The good interviewer makes allowances for this, appreciates a point of view on its own merits, and evaluates the interview accordingly.”
Interviewers also assign candidates numerical ratings for their personal, extracurricular, academic, and overall accomplishments. These scores typically range from 1 to 4 — 1 being the highest and 4 being the lowest — with added plus and minus signs that enhance or diminish the ranking.
Related: [Harvard says admissions officers can't consider race when assigning personal scores]
The 2013 handbook notes that, because ratings are difficult to standardize, the admissions office relies more heavily on interviewers’ written comments than on the numerical scores they assign to students.
“The [Admissions] Committee does not expect to achieve anything approaching national consistency with the use of numerical ratings, so we use them in the most general way to show whether an interview was favorable or unfavorable,” the document states.
The handbook urges alumni to file their reports within two weeks of receiving their interview assignments.
As students around the world anxiously prepare for alumni interviews, admissions officers back in Cambridge sit down to sift through tens of thousands of applications.
Harvard assigns each admissions officer a geographic region and asks that they read all applications from students living in that area.
The first reader for each application records a Harvard-dictated set of data points and makes note of any missing materials. This year, first readers will take down applicants’ citizenship, race, legacy status, recruited athlete status, socioeconomic background, and standardized test scores, according to reading procedures for the Class of 2023.
First readers also verify labels and scores that identify applicants’ likelihood of qualifying for full financial aid. Roughly 60 percent of College students receive need-based scholarships and 20 percent pay nothing towards tuition.
Related: ['This is not who I am': For Harvard admissions dean, the trial is personal]
“It has long been a priority for Harvard to seek talented students from all backgrounds, including those extraordinary individuals who are able to transcend economic disadvantages and achieve unusual academic distinction,” the document reads.
Admissions officers then move to the numbers. First readers assign applicants scores for their academic achievements, extracurricular accomplishments, athletic prospects, personal qualities, and the strength of the student’s “school support” — meaning their letters of recommendation. Staffers use a slightly different numerical scale for each category, though 1 marks the highest ranking across all scales.
The reading procedures offer highly detailed insight into what it takes to earn top marks.
In order to score an academic 1, an applicant must be a “potential major academic contributor” with “summa potential” and “near-perfect scores and grades.” It also helps if the high schooler has “national or international level recognition in academic competitions.”
Those who earn an academic 2 typically score in the mid-700s or higher on the SAT — or 33 or higher on the ACT. An academic 3 denotes an applicant with “mid-600 through low-700 scores” on the SAT or a 29 through 32 on the ACT.
A student with an academic 4, meanwhile, typically boasts “low-to mid-600 scores” on the SAT and between a 26 and 29 on the ACT — academic achievements the admissions office call “adequate preparation” for Harvard. Students who draw a 5 academic ranking typically earn SAT scores in the 500s or an ACT score clocking in at 25 or below. Harvard asserts these high schoolers have only “marginal potential.”
In the extracurricular category, a 1 denotes “possible national-level achievement or professional experience.” High schoolers can hope for a 2 if they serve as “class president, newspaper editor [or] concertmaster.”
An athletic 1, meanwhile, indicates the student could compete in his or her sport “at the national, international or Olympic level.”
In line with past years, the reading procedures for the Class of 2023 also detail how admissions officers calculate personal scores. This year’s iteration, though, is far more fleshed-out than old guidelines. While previous versions of the procedures summed up what it takes to score a personal 1 in a single word — “outstanding” — the 2023 booklet devotes a whole paragraph to the topic.
“Truly outstanding qualities of character; student may display enormous courage in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles in life,” the document reads. “Student may demonstrate a singular ability to lead or inspire those around them. Student may exhibit extraordinary concern or compassion for others. Student receives unqualified and unwavering support from their recommenders.”
Related: [Asian-American Harvard applicants saw lowest admit rate of any racial group from 1995 to 2013]
How Harvard assigns personal scores forms a key point of dispute in the ongoing admissions trial. Students for Fair Admissions has alleged Harvard unfairly assigns qualified Asian Americans lower scores for their personal traits as part of a campaign to systematically deny them admission. The University has repeatedly and strenuously rejected these allegations.
Still, the charges may have had some effect in Cambridge. The Class of 2023 reading procedures explicitly tell Harvard admissions officers how and when they may consider race as they evaluate candidates — something never detailed in past versions of the procedures, which the College produces each admissions cycle. The new guidelines particularly forbid admissions staffers from weighing a candidate's race when assigning scores for personal traits.
Finally, in a section titled “School Support,” the reading procedures outline how admissions officers should rank letters of recommendation penned by teachers and guidance counselors. If a letter writer describes the student as “the best of a career” or “one of the best in many years,” that student is likely to earn a 1. If, however, the applicant is merely "one of the best” or “the best this year,” they are more likely to score a 2.
Most applications see only two readers. The second person who reads the application — always another employee in the admissions office — typically checks facts and records applicants’ scores in an internal database.
Harvard professors sometimes review portions of an application if it includes notable academic or artistic work.
Following the reading and ranking, the best-scoring applications go before two successive Admissions Office committees. A majority of each committee must vote “yes” on any given applicant for that student to win a spot at Harvard.
The Class of 2023 reading procedures indicate that all applications with a 2- overall score or better should make it to the committee phase. The first reader decides on a case-by-case basis whether those who earn a 3+ will proceed, while those scoring a 3 or worse typically do not advance.
The first committee that examines all applications is a smaller sub-committee comprising five to eight people: admissions officers, faculty readers, and a senior admissions office employee who serves as chair. There are several of these committees; each one focuses on applicants hailing from a particular geographic region.

The subcommittees’ discussions and debates as they review candidates can be rather lengthy.
“Subcommittees may discuss a single case for half an hour or even more before voting on a recommendation to offer the full Committee,” the 2013 interviewer handbook states.
The subcommittees work throughout the fall and winter as officers slog through the early action and regular decision cycles.
“Subcommittees begin meeting in November for the Early Action process and for three- to four-day shifts in late January until the end of February for the Regular Decision process,” the handbook states.
The subcommittee holds a vote to determine which applicants it will pass on to the full admissions committee, a group comprising 40 application readers. A simple majority of the subcommittee must vote in an applicant’s favor for that student to move to the next phase.
The full committee scrutinizes and votes on each application at least once. It, too, obeys a simple majority rule.
But the full committee can be fickle. It often changes its mind, revisiting and occasionally rescinding its decisions to accept — or reject — borderline applicants.
The flexibility of the process preserves “the possibility of changing decisions virtually until the day the Admissions Committee mails them,” according to the 2013 interviewer handbook.
In mid-December, Harvard will inform early action applicants of their fate. In late March, the College will do the same for regular decision candidates.
Though this year’s class is heading into the process with a much more detailed knowledge of Harvard admissions than any applicant pool in recent memory, they share at least one trait with decades of their peers.
Until that email pops up in their inbox, all they can do is wait.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s soccer team (3-11, 1-4 Ivy) fell to Dartmouth (5-5-5, 2-1-2) by a score of 2-0 in Hanover, N.H., on Saturday. Men’s soccer was one of six Crimson teams to make the trip up to New Hampshire to face its Ivy League rival in rainy conditions over the weekend.
Harvard’s last time out saw the team deal with even worse conditions, when its non-conference matchup versus Northeastern on Tuesday was cancelled due to persistent lightning. Despite playing just over an hour against their cross-town rivals, the game was delayed and eventually abandoned. NCAA rules require 70 minutes of play for a match to count towards a team’s standings, and thus, Tuesday’s game ended up being no more than a friendly for Harvard.
Saturday’s conditions were not much better, as the game saw rain and temperatures hovering in the 30s. The match was played in spite of this, with the team from up north seeming to make better use of the weather.
“It was tough to adjust to the way the field was playing, it made the game more scrappy at times,” senior midfielder Eduardo Cedeno said. “I think Dartmouth kind of took the initiative at the beginning and put us on the back foot, but once we got a hold of it, it became back and forth with two evenly matched teams.”
Dartmouth found its first clear-cut chance in the 22nd minute, when it was awarded a penalty after Harvard committed a foul in the 18-yard box. Forward Eduvie Ikoba converted for Dartmouth for his first goal of the season, to put Dartmouth ahead inside half an hour.
Dartmouth went to work putting pressure on the Harvard defense from the get-go. Sophomore goalkeeper Matt Freese was forced into three saves in the opening seven minutes but benefited from more breathing room as the game went on.
The Crimson looked more lively after conceding, moving up the field and beginning to test Dartmouth’s keeper. Despite this increased intensity, Harvard went into the break down by a goal.
“There were moments, especially at the end of the first half, where we had Dartmouth kind of pinned back,” Cedeno said. “We were connecting a lot of passes, moving the ball from left to right, and getting into really good spots. For us I think that was the biggest positive.”
Freese was busy in the net all evening for Harvard, making a career-high nine saves during the hard-fought, wet matchup. He now leads the Ivy League in saves per game, averaging 5.45 stops per match in the Crimson goal.
Despite Freese’s and the rest of the team’s best efforts, Dartmouth doubled its lead shortly after halftime. With ten minutes played in the half, Ikoba bagged his second goal of the game, and second of the season. Harvard struggled to respond, with the game ending with a scoreline of 2-0.
“Obviously the end result wasn’t the greatest for us,” senior forward Nate Devine said. “But I actually thought it was a pretty decent performance for us in terms of fighting until the end.”
Harvard finished the match with eight shots, two of them forcing saves from Dartmouth’s keeper. Dartmouth, in contrast, racked up 22 shots on the night, eleven of which were on target. Harvard were awarded five corners on the night, with Dartmouth finished the match with eight.
Harvard maintains the slight advantage in the all time series versus Dartmouth, with Saturday’s match cutting Dartmouth’s deficit to only six matches, at 44-38-10. The two programs tend to play close games, with Saturday being the first time in twelve years that the matchup was decided by more than one goal.
Saturday’s match drops Harvard to seventh in the Ivy League, with three points, while Dartmouth now sits in fourth place, with eight. Harvard’s only conference win this season came against Yale in late September, and they’ll be looking to round out the season with wins against Columbia and Penn in the coming weeks. Harvard will be celebrating its seniors in its next time out, as its set to host Columbia this Saturday, in its final home matchup of the season.
“Although we’re eliminated from Ivy League and postseason contention, I think playing in these games is really important for the young players especially,” Devine said. “Being a fifth-year senior, I think it falls on my shoulders a little bit to show them how to fight to end, no matter what the score is. Putting the young players in those positions is definitely going to help them for the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brian Shi is a gifted tennis player. The freshman was a blue-chip recruit, sixth-best in the nation according to the Tennis Recruiting Network. That makes him one of the top tennis recruits in recent Harvard history. But Shi’s path to the Crimson was neither conventional nor smooth.
The Jericho, N.Y., native has been playing tennis since he was five. When asked why he became such a serious tennis player, he pointed immediately to his first coach, Mihai Grecu, whom he worked with until he was 16.
“I guess he saw some sort of talent in me — I mean I was a five-year-old so I have no idea what kind of talent a five-year-old could have — but from there he got me super into it,” Shi said. “I started playing tournaments when I was eight or nine and he was a big part of my life.”
Shi did not go to a physical high school. Instead, in order to ensure that he had the time and freedom to travel around the world for tennis, he spent all four years of his secondary education in online school. His classes had a start date and an end date with suggested deadlines in between, but it was up to him to decide when and where to study. When he was not playing in tournaments or practicing, he was usually at home or working from a hotel.
“In that aspect it was kind of like I had to be responsible finishing my work, because I did not have someone looking over me all the time,” Shi said. “So basically I taught myself everything online and then got feedback from teachers.”
Shi had pushed to move to an online school because he knew how much time it would give him to improve his tennis, but it was not an easy decision for his family. Shi said his parents, who immigrated to New York from China in their twenties, are tough and academically focused and would have preferred him to stay in a more traditional school setting.
“When I started doing really well at the end of eighth grade, I started traveling a lot and my grades started dipping because I was missing so much school,” Shi said. “My teachers were not really that accommodating, so I guess my parents were kind of forced to put me into online school.”
Soon after attaining his desired move to online school, Shi came close to quitting the sport he loved. When he was 14, right after he recorded one of the best results of his career, the New York native developed rhabdomyolysis, a breakdown of muscle tissue that Shi said came from training too hard without letting his body recover. He spent a week in the hospital and felt lethargic for the rest of the year. Training and matches became exceedingly difficult while he recovered, but Shi decided to stick with the sport.
It paid off. Shi eventually regained his strength and quickly improved. By the end of high school, he had posted a career high ITF junior tour ranking of No. 62 and participated in the main draw of the 2017 Junior US Open and the 2018 Australian Open.
In his first year of collegiate competition, he has been thrown straight into the fire, holding his own against some of the best college players in the country in Harvard’s first three fall tournaments. Months into his college career, Shi is confident that he will play high in the lineup this season. The Crimson’s season starts in earnest next semester, but it is already apparent that Harvard has something special in Shi.
“Brian is very strong, very balanced, moves well,” said Harvard coach Andrew Rueb ’95. “He’s got an excellent serve that can be even more of a weapon. He’s got an all-court approach. He plays aggressive tennis. You can see him out on court and he can put together games and sets that can beat anybody.”
Co-captain Chris Morrow thinks Shi has hit the ground running and fits in well with the team.
“He’s adjusted really well and is engaging with the team in a really positive way,” Morrow said. “He’s really humble and is a really willing learner who is open to feedback.”
The Jericho native believes that he is still getting acclimated to college life both on and off the court. He pinpointed that the key difference on the court is that in college.
“You’re always playing someone good,” Shi said. “It’s important to stay confident all the time even when you’re losing more than you’re used to.”
Off the court, the standout freshman said that the transition back into a normal classroom setting and particularly having timed tests was initially challenging but that it was nothing he had not been through before. He added that he has really started to get used to the workload over the last few weeks.
Rueb believes that the freshman star’s untraditional high school experience will help him as both a student and an athlete going forward.
“He got a chance to manage his workload, his AP classes, and some of the other things he did.” Rueb said. “To do that on the road requires a very high level of time-management skills.”
Shi is excited about his future with the Crimson. As for what will come after Harvard, that is still up in the air, as it is for so many college athletes. However, the first-year has been giving it some thought.
“I think when you get into Harvard your priorities change a little bit when you’re an athlete,” Shi said. “I see a bunch of the older guys on the team are looking at jobs and interviewing for jobs, so it makes you think about what you want to do after tennis.”
But Shi is not closing the door on a tennis career after graduation.
“I still want to go pro after college,” Shi said. “I still want to go for it.”

As I write from the exam room of Urgent Care, icing my nearly fractured pinky toe after my laptop fell on it while doing a pset, I’m left questioning whether I will make it through this semester. Not just physically. You’re probably feeling the same way as we embark on the next round of midterms (I’m sorry but if a class has three midterms a semester they are NO LONGER considered midterms). But as my toe will eventually heal, we must tell ourselves that so will the wounds from this semester.
Look at everything as a learning experience
A mentality thing: if you view all of your obstacles as hurdles you need to jump over to “grow as a person,” having these issues won’t seem as stressful, but rather important for your self-growth. That sounds legit enough, right?
A little bit of stress is okay
My philosophy is “everything in moderation”...ideally. A little bit of stress can go a long way in motivating you and making you look forward to things in the future, so embrace that. “But how am I supposed to live in the moment?” you may ask. We Harvard students especially need to realize that we can — shocker! — appreciate the “now” and also be excited about the good in store for us.
Prioritize your health
Definitely easier said than done, but once you start realizing that nothing matters as much as getting enough sleep, eating right, exercise, and a generally stable immune system, academics and grades as a whole start to feel less consequential. Sadly this doesn’t apply to pre-meds.
Find something you love to do for YOU
Don’t kid yourself: you’re a Harvard student and more likely than not you’re in extracurriculars just for the leadership position or to build your resume. This makes it easy to start treating commitments like chores. And there goes your motivation and morale! Find something on campus that you’re passionate about or you just find relaxing, whether that’s a group of people on campus, or a sport, that you don’t need to add to your resume. That way you know you’re actually doing something for your happiness.
There’s always next semester…
Next semester we obviously won’t be taking the same classes anymore. You’ve lived and you’ve learned and next semester is a clean slate. Whether it’s that you no longer have to take a three-pset-a-week math class just to fulfill your concentration’s math requirement, or that you no longer have to go to those pointless lectures for your pointless gen-ed, there’s a light at the end of the tunnel...as if we aren’t going to regret our class choices next semester, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.
DISCLAIMER: Even though writing this was therapeutic for myself, I’M NOT A THERAPIST so don’t take my advice as the Word of God. But I hope you join me on my journey to ~positivity~ and ~optimism~.

Though he himself is agnostic on whether or not ghosts exist, resident skeleton and History Professor Dr. Zachary Nowak nevertheless led a Ghost and Skeleton tour showing off the spooky side of Harvard Yard. In doing so, Professor Nowak let some of Harvard’s literal and metaphoric skeletons out of the closet.
Flyby: What’s the most haunted place at Harvard?
Dr. Nowak: I think the Old Yard is the most haunted place, because it has the ghosts of all the enslaved people that worked here, it has the ghosts of Indian college students who died, and it has the ghosts I think of a lot of initially young boys who felt like they had to do something because their parents wanted them to do that. So not that those are all equal in their sadness, but I think there’s a lot of spirits hanging around in the yard…Also the Secret Court students who could never walk, and who Harvard has heretofore not given posthumous degrees. The administration says that there’s no precedent for it, but actually they gave posthumous degrees to a number of WWI Harvard students who went and died in the war.
F: Which is spookier, the loss of Harvard time, or murderous Professor Webster who killed his creditor?
DN: As a professor who doesn’t fully appreciate Harvard Time, I would say Webster is spookier.
F: Would you ever kill a student à la Webster if they were really annoying in section?
DN: Given the academic job market, the possibility of a new professor feeling destitute and needing to borrow money is very high, however my likelihood of killing and dismembering a student is zero.
F: Any advice for freshmen who think that their dorm might be haunted?
DN: Yes! There is a guy who just came out with a book called Ghosts of Cambridge, and I think I would contact him and ask him if he knew about that particular ghost that is haunting that dorm.
From the gallons of blood ingrained in the mortar of Sever Hall to the horror movie-esque bowels of Harvard’s steam tunnels, beware as you walk the Yard this Halloween. Also, don’t talk to any students who introduce themselves as Holbrook Smith and look like they’ve stepped right out of 1914.
