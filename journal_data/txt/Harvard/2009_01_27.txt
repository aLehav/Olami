Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner John Updike ’54 died today of lung cancer at the age of 76.  
Updike was noted for authoring over 50 books over the course of his decades-long career, winning his two Pulitzers for his books “Rabbit is Rich” and “Rabbit at Rest.”  
Born in Pennsylvania, Updike graduated as the valedictorian of small-town Shillington high school and entered Harvard in 1950 on a scholarship.  
An English major, Updike became president of The Harvard Lampoon in 1953, and graduated the following year summa cum laude, before serving a fellowship at Oxford University. His first poem appeared in The New Yorker in 1954. 
The award-winning author was memorialized on the Harvard campus as his fame extended elsewhere. Updike presided over the opening of an exhibit of his manuscripts at the Houghton Museum in 1987. His papers are still available for viewing at the Houghton Library today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Top administrators in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences will release a preliminary, across-the-board fiscal plan for FAS this week—a move aiming to bring some clarity to a muddled financial picture as the Faculty begins to prepare its tightened budget next week.
The “80% FAS-wide plan” marks an early attempt by Faculty administrators to begin turning localized feedback from individual units within FAS into a more generalized scheme for cutbacks that will show for the first time how departmental priorities fit into the Faculty’s larger budgeting plan.
In December, Smith urged all departments to think about how to cut 10 to 15 percent of their budgets. The move came in anticipation of a projected economic shortfall of at least $100 million in the Faculty’s unrestricted funds for the fiscal year beginning July 1. 
Departments have since responded with their own plans for how their expenses might be cut. Government Department Chair Nancy L. Rosenblum ’69 said that her unit had made plans for a 15 percent budget cut for the next fiscal year, with cuts tailored to address areas that were not particularly “wounding.”
“We worked hard to find places where it wouldn’t touch our core business,” she said. 
But there is no guarantee that the final plan, drawing on recommendations from departments, centers, and units across FAS will honor all departmental priorities, nor will it produce equal levels of cuts in all areas. 
“Not all units have the same capacity to absorb cuts,” Smith wrote in a letter sent to faculty and staff to announce the upcoming 80% plan. “Nor is it wise for us to reduce everyone equally if continued excellence is our goal.
The 80% plan will help planners get a big-picture model to help with the budget-planning process for next year, which is set to begin in early February, and is typically completed in March.
But as the sobriquet suggests, the fiscal blueprint will not be conclusive. A finalized set of recommendations will be released later this semester.
“‘80%’ means we will provide good information, but we’ll keep working on the total plan as budgeting starts,” Smith wrote in an e-mailed statement. “We need more time than we have to create a solid plan that fully addresses the financial challenge before us.”
In his letter, Smith reiterated a commitment to priorities like the launch of General Education this fall, while suggesting that “other timelines,” like the pace of development in Allston, were subject to adjustment.
Though some department leaders and faculty members interviewed by The Crimson said the details of the 80% plan remain unclear, they expressed willingness to make whatever cuts are prescribed.
“Faculty really have been understanding and uncomplaining and generous,” Rosenblum said. “I think that we have quite good esprit. I think we have a pretty good understanding of the constraints on FAS.”
In addition to the 80% plan, the administration has also been moving forward on other FAS-wide initiatives, a number of which were submitted as suggestions to the Priorities Committee, whose members Smith named in December.
The ad hoc body recently reviewed and endorsed a proposal to change the set points for the heating and cooling of FAS buildings to match those recommended by the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers. The two-degree change—to 68 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months—could potentially save more than $600,000 a year.
“We have over a million square feet of building space around FAS,” said Scott Haywood, building manager of Kirkland House. “So if you look at what it costs for heating per square foot over the course of a winter, it may very well amount to that kind of money.”
Smith declined to name the other FAS-wide initiatives underway, professing a desire to “communicate the entire plan together [rather] than in a piecemeal fashion.”

Heading into the biggest meet of the regular season, the Harvard women’s swimming and diving team has proven that it’s a force to be reckoned with. The Crimson (5-0, 5-0 Ivy) preserved its undefeated season on Saturday, taking down Brown (2-2, 2-2), 199.5-99.5, at Blodgett Pool. “I think we did really well, especially coming off of exams, because exams take a lot out of you mentally and physically,” sophomore Kate Mills said. “It was great to see us come out there, swim fast times, and swim like a team.”Mills led the way once again with two individual wins, while Harvard’s talented crop of freshmen and sophomores provided the depth to overcome the Bears.The Crimson started the meet with a bang, sweeping the top three places in the 200-yard medley relay.Mills won the day’s first individual event, the 1000-yard freestyle, in 10:05.93. Freshman Kristi Korsberg and junior Katie Faulkner followed to give Harvard another sweep. Korsberg’s strong performance was one of several from the Crimson’s rookie class. Freshmen Meghan Leddy and Victoria Pratt recorded back-to-back dominating victories in the first half of the meet. Leddy won the 100-yard backstroke in 58.53, and Pratt followed up by taking first in the 100-yard breaststroke. Her time of 1:06.99 was nearly three seconds ahead of Brown’s top swimmer.“[The freshmen] are a great force,” Mills said. “They’re really upbeat and they’re great to practice with.”  Freshman Helen Pitchik also won a race of her own, touching the wall in 2:21.63 in the 200-yard breaststroke.“They’re a great group of girls,” junior co-captain Alexandra Clarke said. “They’ve been consistently contributing, and it’s really great to see them coming into their own in the last month of the season.”The Harvard divers had a solid meet, highlighted by sophomore Marissa Ash’s performance. Ash placed first in the 1-meter event with 250.36 points, her first-ever collegiate dual-meet victory, and was runner-up at the 3-meter height.Freshman Leslie Rea won the 3-meter competition with 258.45 points, and sophomore Jenny Reese was second in the 1-meter.“The divers have really stepped up,” Clarke said. “They’ve been crucial to our success this season.” Sophomores Christine Kaufmann and Katherine Pickard, along with Clarke, were the Crimson’s other individual winners.Kaufmann took first in the 200-yard butterfly, finishing in 2:05.63, while Pickard won the 500-freestyle in 4:54.04. Freshman Catherine Zagroba competed in both events, placing third in the butterfly and second in the freestyle.Clarke won the 100-yard butterfly, which was one of the meet’s more closely contested events, touching in 58.02. Freshman Monica Burgos was right behind her, finishing in 58.40. Mills earned her second victory the last individual event of the day, finishing the 200-yard individual medley in 2:06.05.And in the meet’s final race, sophomore Katy Hinkle anchored the 200-yard freestyle relay team to victory, sneaking past the Bears’ final swimmer to win the event by just .14 seconds. She was joined on the team by classmates Ali Slack and Holly Furman, along with freshman Margaret Flatt. For the second consecutive meet, Harvard swam an unusual lineup to give the women a chance to try different events. “There were some pretty impressive swims in that people were doing well in events they don’t usually train for,” Clarke said. “We’re really excited to see what people can do when they’re back in their best events this weekend.”This weekend brings the annual Harvard-Yale-Princeton tri-meet, an event the team has been looking forward to since the season’s beginning.“It’s the home stretch and this is what we’ve been working for all season,” Mills said. “It’s one of the big meets and we’re getting excited because it’s home. We want to go out and show them that we’re a really strong force.”The Crimson will try to dethrone the defending Ivy champion Tigers in a matchup of the league’s only undefeated teams. Competition starts at 6 p.m. on Friday.“I’m really confident going into it,” Clarke said. “I think this is the first time since I’ve been here that we have a real shot to win HYP and then Ivies, which is our real priority. It would be really nice to finish the regular season undefeated.”—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

With two weeks until its Ivy League opener, Harvard wrestling is struggling to find its identity.A banged-up Crimson squad (1-7, 0-2 EIWA) dropped both dual meets this weekend, falling 38-3 to No. 8 Lehigh on Saturday before coming up short, 30-11, against Army on Sunday. Although the grapplers faced a daunting challenge in the eighth-ranked Mountain Hawks (19-1, 5-0), Harvard coach Jay Weiss expressed disappointment at the effort.“Even going against a top team, not at full strength, I still don’t think we wrestled well,” he said. “[Lehigh’s Leeman-Turner Arena] is an exciting atmosphere with lots of people, but we didn’t bring out our best.”Junior co-captain J.P. O’Connor (157 lbs) was the only wrestler to notch a victory in both his bouts, with senior Tommy Picarsic (133) and rookie Bryan Panzano (174) adding wins on Sunday.While the scores of both duals appear lopsided, the additional victories and a number of close contests represented improvement over the weekend.“I don’t care about the score, we were looking for a turnaround against Army and it was a lot better,” Weiss said. “We won three bouts and were leading two others in the third period, so the outcome could have been very different.”Indeed, the Black Knights (10-4-1, 4-1) might not have enjoyed such a comfortable margin without a Harvard forfeit at 125 lbs and the absence of junior co-captain Louis Caputo (184) and sophomore Corey Jantzen (141). Caputo attributed his absence in Sunday’s contest to a shoulder injury sustained earlier in the week.Besides the disadvantage of competing without the 2006 All-American, the Crimson demonstrated inexplicable improvement over the course of a day, baffling the coaching staff.“We’re in an odd position,” Weiss said. “I saw a different team on Saturday and Sunday, so the question is, where do we go from here?”As the Ivy season fast approaches, Harvard can only hope that it finds its stride in time.ARMY 30, HARVARD 11The Crimson followed its Saturday loss to the Mountain Hawks with a trip to Westpoint, N.Y., taking on the Black Knights at Gillis Field House. Panzano (1-8) opened the scoring for Harvard with his first dual meet victory of the season, topping Dean Gaier 7-2. The freshman earned two takedowns and an escape from bottom to claim the decision and tie the team score at three.Unfortunately for the Crimson, the heavier weights fell in Army’s favor, as the hosts took three straight bouts and a commanding lead. By the time Picarsic (3-2) took the mat, Harvard already trailed, 21-3, but the senior grappler maintained his focus.After building a commanding 7-1 lead to start the third frame, Picarsic scored two takedowns to close the match and earn a major decision, 12-2, for the first time this year.“[Picarsic] kept up the pace, always pushing for points,” Weiss praised. “He’s been doing a great job leading this team on and off the mat.”No. 4 O’Connor (17-2) matched his senior teammate with another 12-2 major, topping Rudy Chelednik to finish the afternoon and cap a personal undefeated weekend.With three solid bouts and close defeats for junior Pat Ziemnik and freshman Spencer DeSena, it was clear that Harvard brought a greater level of intensity to its second match after exams.“Sometimes it takes a tough loss to realize you’re better than that,” said Caputo, referring to the contest with Lehigh. “We picked it up, wrestled tougher, and took advantage of some better pairings against Army.”NO. 8 LEHIGH 38, HARVARD 3O’Connor logged the only victory against Lehigh, as the Crimson fell victim to six ranked opponents in Bethlehem, Penn. Two falls against Harvard freshmen Sean Murphy (197) and Johnny Motley (141) as well as two major decisions exposed a difficult return to the mat for the Crimson. Even 7th-ranked Caputo (19-4) dropped a frustrating bout, watching victory slip away in the waning moments of the third period.Despite his injured shoulder, Caputo built a 2-0 lead through two hard-fought periods before yielding an escape to No. 15 David Craig. Trailing 2-1, the Mountain Hawk junior managed a takedown with eight seconds remaining to upset the Crimson standout and hand Caputo only his fourth loss this year.Even though the team effort fell short, O’Connor continued his brilliant junior campaign by notching a team-leading 12th dual meet victory. With a 4-2 decision over Sean Bilodeau, the All-American showed no rust after a three-week break from competition.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

Continuing a recent trend for the Harvard fencing team, the No. 5 women far exceeded expectations, while the No. 7 men fell short at the St. John’s Invitational Saturday in Queens, N.Y. A late addition to the schedule, the meet featured two other teams—the Red Storm and Ohio State, last year’s national champions. While the women (11-1) bested its opponents 18-9 and 15-12, respectively, the men (5-5) dropped a down-to-the-wire 14-13 contest to St. John’s and lost 17-10 to the Buckeyes.An impressive day from the women featured an even more impressive day from freshman sabre fencer Caroline Vloka. The rookie went 6-0 on the afternoon, including a win over Olympian Dagmara Wozniak. “Caroline’s had an incredible season, and she definitely showed that this weekend,” co-captain Emily Cross said. “She’s been performing at a really high standard. She’s just been doing really great. We’ve fenced a lot of great teams, so it was great to see her step up to the plate the way she did.”Although the rest of the sabre squad lags far behind Vloka in experience, the épée and particularly the foil events have more than made up for any shortcomings. Senior épée fencer Maria Larsson has come on of late, going 5-1 on the day, a pace matched by foil fencer Cross. Cross and teammates freshman Shelby MacLeod, junior Anna Podolsky, and junior co-captain Arielle Pensler—who fenced for the first time this season, returning from injury—posted a 9-0 drubbing of a solid St. John’s team and a big 5-4 win over a strong Buckeye squad.“I felt stronger about our women’s chances, and really it always comes down to the foil squad,” Brand said. “We have a really solid foil squad, and they just came through for us big time…Those three or four really strong fencers always put us in a good position.”On the men’s side, the team benefited from co-captain Benji Ungar’s return to health. “Benji looks physically fit and back to his old form again,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “He looks like he’s back, and if he stays healthy, he certainly has a shot at recapturing the NCAA individual title.”The senior’s nagging injuries during the fall campaign hampered the performance of the épée squad, which often became the deciding factor in meets. Saturday was no different. Harvard came into its final round of epee against the Red Storm leading and needing only two wins to clinch victory, but it would only get one. Ungar went 5-1 and junior Karl Harmenberg added a 4-2 performance for the squad that easily beat its Buckeye counterpart, 6-3.“I think we should’ve done better,” Brand said. “Our guys weren’t up to the test at that point in time. On any given day, they can beat the best in the country, we just didn’t have it that match.”It was the foil that led the way against St. John’s, besting the Red Storm 8-1 and setting up the epee showdown. As on the women’s side, it was a rookie that shined in the men’s sabre, as Valentin Staller boasted a 4-2 record.Overall it was a telling day for a Crimson team that has just one more warm-up competition next weekend before it hits the heart of its season at the Ivy League Championships next month.“I’m pretty optimistic,” Cross said. “The women’s team, we beat some of the toughest teams probably in the country, and we’re feeling pretty strong. We’ve got a couple of weeks left to train, and especially coming off these wins, we’ve got a pretty good mental attitude; we’re ready to go. “I think we have a pretty good shot at taking it all this year.”—Staff writer Madeleine I.

If the Harvard men’s tennis team felt any frustration over exams, it vented on its guests with a forceful showing at the Murr Center courts for the Intersession Invitational.The Crimson hosted Auburn-Montgomery and Marist over the three-day weekend tournament, returning to action at a blistering pace after nearly three months without a contest.“As a team, the best thing we could have done was compete,” co-captain Chris Clayton said. “After reading period and exams everyone is hungry to get out and play.”Harvard did more than simply compete, though, posting a 15-13 singles record and a 9-8 doubles mark against National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics national champion UAM and a talented Marist squad.“[The invitational] went great,” Harvard coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “Most of the team did a very fine job against that high level of competition. It’s a good starting place, and I’m encouraged by where they may be able to go.”The team displayed a stellar effort up and down the lineup, as six players notched winning records despite the grueling amount of court time. Most team members competed in singles and doubles each day, testing the squad’s toughness.“As a team, everyone was playing with intensity and competing hard every match,” said Clayton, who was sidelined with a rotator cuff injury. “[The schedule] was tiring, but it set the tone for the team for the rest of the season.”With its top player out and sophomore Aba Omodele-Lucien hampered by illness, the Crimson found its stride early and benefited from particularly strong play by junior Mike Hayes. The third-year player stayed locked in through the weekend en route to a 5-1 overall mark, earning praise from Fish as the only Harvard competitor to post a 3-0 singles record.“[Hayes’] effort was really excellent,” Fish said. “He’s committed to doing what he needs to do with a single-minded focus. It allowed him to play at a different level and showed what he’s capable of.”After dropping the opening set to Marist’s Loic Sessagesimi on Friday, Hayes never looked back, claiming the match, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0. Encouraged by his turnaround, the junior completed an undefeated weekend by pummeling two UAM opponents, yielding just six games through both matches. Despite the dominant performance, Hayes refused to take credit for a drastic change in his game, echoing his coaches’ emphasis on mental preparation.“I think [the key] is focus, nothing miraculous.” Hayes said. “I’m not training differently, it’s just attention to little things.”Indeed, a break from training for finals period had little impact on any of the Crimson, as seniors Sasha Ermakov and Michael Kalfayan, sophomore Alexi Chijoff-Evans, and freshmen Alistair Felton and Davis Mangam claimed winning weekends. In addition, the 2-1 singles performance of rookie Robertson McAnulty and 3-1 doubles results from co-captain Kalfayan and sophomore Will Guzick reflected a consistently high level of team play.“Everything is a team effort,” Clayton explained. “Pretty much everyone played strong, and as a senior, it’s great to see young guys stepping up and contributing.”Clayton’s classmate Ermakov may have shouldered the largest burden, stepping into the top singles spot while the co-captain recovers. Ermakov dispatched Nikola Miskovic and Francisco Redondo of UAM before falling, 7-6, 7-5, to the Senators’ Michael Johnson in a hard-fought title match.While Ermakov’s quality effort has become characteristic of the standout senior, Kalfayan and Fish expressed excitement over the stellar contribution from Harvard’s freshmen.“[The rookies] played extremely well,” Kalfayan said. “It was definitely a step up and a chance for them to prove that they can be strong college players.”Although Liinus Hietaniemi continued to struggle in his first season, the trio of Felton, Mangam, and McAnulty combined to go 10-9 (6-3 in singles), peaking at an opportune time before Ivy League play begins.“Those three really did some balling,” Fish said in reference to the freshmen. “It’s nice to have that kind of strong, disciplined contribution because it pushes everyone else up.”With impressive performances throughout the roster, the Crimson demonstrated its preparation for the long road ahead. As a fresh semester begins, Harvard will look to maintain its pace and continue to post dominant results.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Andrew Hatch, the former Harvard quarterback and LSU signal-caller who briefly started for the Tigers in 2008 after transferring to LSU from Harvard the previous year, is planning to transfer back to Harvard, the Associated Press reported on Jan. 15. But according to Harvard’s admissions office, the well-traveled athlete might not have a spot reserved for him back in Cambridge.In March of 2008, the college announced a two-year moratorium on transfer admissions due to housing limitations. That policy appears to also apply to Hatch, despite past instances of athletes transferring out and then returning.“Transfer admissions has been suspended, therefore no candidates, regardless of previous admission, are eligible to transfer to Harvard College at this time,” director of transfer admissions E. Marlene Vergara Rotner wrote in an e-mail on Jan. 16.The admissions office does not comment on the cases of specific students.Hatch made national headlines by starting the season opener for LSU, last year’s national champions, before suffering a series of injuries that sidelined him for the second half of the year. He finished the season 25-for-45, passing for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Hatch also ran 35 times for 139 yards and two scores.There is precedent for Hatch’s return. In 2003, Zachary M. Puchtel ’05-’07 transferred to Minnesota, where he played the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons as a walk-on for the basketball squad. After his eligibility expired, Puchtel returned to Harvard and received his degree.In 2002, catcher Mickey Kropf ’04-05 transferred to Vanderbilt, where he played for two seasons before returning to Cambridge. Both those transfers, however, occurred before the current moratorium took effect.—Jillian K. Kushner contributed to the reporting of this story.

The No. 4 Harvard women’s squash team (5-0, 3-0 Ivy) opened up 2009 with a convincing 8-1 victory on the road Friday over No. 6 Stanford (2-6). The win sets up a battle of unbeatens with No. 3 Trinity at the Barnaby Courts next week. The Crimson won all of its matches except at the top flight, where sophomore June Tiong was forced to retire in the second game. A minor back injury became aggravated after a collision with a Cardinal player. She retired for precautionary measures and is expected to be healthy for Harvard’s next match.For a team that has not played competitively in five weeks, the Crimson showed little rust against Stanford, the strongest opponent that the team has faced this season.“We were really excited to get back on the court after exam period. We had the opportunity to practice beforehand to get back into a rhythm,” junior captain Johanna Snyder said. “This was our first difficult match and I felt we all played very well.”Harvard was paced by its upperclassmen, all of whom recorded 3-0 sweeps. No. 6 Snyder rolled over Stanford’s Kyla Sherwood, 9-1, 9-0, 9-3. Fellow junior Katherine O’Donnell surrendered only six points en route to a 9-1, 9-0, 9-5 victory. No. 9 junior Sandra Mumanachit also recorded a 3-0 sweep. This was Mumanachit’s first match of the year in which she did not record a 9-0 whitewash game.The Crimson’s younger players faced a tougher test but emerged victorious. After winning the first set, freshman No. 4 Emily Park dropped the second set, 7-9, but rallied to win the final two convincingly, 9-3, 9-1, to earn the 3-1 victory. Sophomore Alexandra Zindman dropped a tight third set, 8-10, but won a close-fought fourth set, 9-6, to hold on to win the match at No. 8, 3-1.Harvard’s top flights continued to overwhelm their opponents. No. 2 freshman Nirasha Guruge moved to 5-0 on the season after a solid 9-1, 9-2, 9-5 victory. Sophomores No. 3 Alisha Mashruwala and No. 7 Bethan Williams also recorded 3-0 wins to complete the rout for the Crimson. Harvard has been dominant in this first half of the season. No player has gone to a fifth game all year, and the team boasts a collective match record of 43-2.Crimson coach Satinder Bajwa has emphasized the importance of using these early-season matches as opportunities for the players to hone and refine their shots in preparation for the more challenging matches that await.“When they feel that the competition is not as strong, the players try to force out some of their weaknesses and test themselves,” Bajwa said in an earlier interview.The degree to which these weaknesses have been forced out will soon come to light. Despite this being the toughest test yet for the team, it was but a warm-up for the brutal stretch of scheduling that February will bring. The Crimson next takes on Trinity, undefeated and ranked third in the nation, on Feb. 4 at home. Trinity has defeated Harvard in five out of the past seven matches, including twice in 2008, the most recent being a 6-3 setback in the opening round of last years’s Howe Cup Championship.However, the strong start to the season has inspired confidence in the team.“We feel very confident going against Trinity,” Snyder said. “We are going to get on court as much as possible in the next week. All we’ll do is train.” The Crimson then takes on No. 2 Penn and No. 1 Princeton during the first half of February heading into the season-ending Howe Cup Championship.—Staff writer Barrett P.

Splitting ranks between the Harvard-hosted Crimson Multi Meet and the Terrier Invitational at Boston University on Friday and Saturday, the Harvard co-ed track and field team notched two event wins, five ECAC and IC4A qualifiers, and 17 top-10 finishes.“I was really pleased with how we competed,” Crimson coach Jason Saretsky said. “Coming off of final exams is always pretty tricky, so it’s good to see we’re all ramped up for this indoor series.”Freshman John Dingus provided the highlight of the weekend’s events with his 48.37 finish in the 400-meter dash at BU, earning a new school record for the indoor event and a fourth-place finish on the day. Kobie Fuller ’02 held the previous record at 48.38, which he set in his senior year.“[John has] really been a pleasant surprise for us,” Saretsky said. “Fastest time in indoors for a freshman is truly remarkable.”Harvard now heads into a five-meet home stretch that will wrap up the end of the indoor season, culminating with the Heptagonal Championships.TERRIER INVITATIONALJoining Dingus on the 400-meter leaderboards, senior Derek Jones took 10th in the event with a finish of 49.22, and freshman Jonathan Meminger posted a 17th-place time at 49.61.The Crimson ‘A’ quad for the 4x400-meter relay captured 11th with a time of 3:21.10.Junior Jonathan Brito added another strong performance with an eighth-place jump in the high jump, clearing the 1.84-meter bar, while rookie Phil Ngo logged a 12th-place long jump of 6.49 meters.Volunteer coach Chris Bryce won the weight throw event with a toss of 20.04 meters, earning a qualifier for the USATF Championship.On the women’s side, sophomore Claire Richardson capped things off with her sixth-place finish in the 5K, clocking in at an ECAC-qualifying 16:50.78.“It was a [personal record] which was nice,” Richardson said. “It felt really good. It was just nice to be back racing.”Sophomores Hilary May and Jamie Olson and freshman Nichole Cochran finished eighth, 10th, and 11th in the 1000-meter run, all earning ECAC qualifications. May timed in at 2:53.38, while Olson and Cochran finished at 2:56.11 and 2:57.26, respectively.Elsewhere, senior Dara Wilson took ninth in the 55-meter hurdles at 8.39, while co-captain Aishlinn O’Callaghan finished the 500-meter run in 1:16.03 to also earn ninth in her event.Junior Elissa Reidy posted a pair of top-10 marks with her seventh-place, 5.30-meter jump in the long jump and eighth-place, 11.20-meter leap in the triple jump.CRIMSON MULTI MEETHarvard assistant coach Matt Chisam won the men’s heptathlon with 5322 points, while volunteer coach Kasey Hill won the women’s pentathlon with 4009 points. Senior Shannon Flahive, sophomore Dina Emde, and freshman Nicole Sliva took the two, three, and four spots at 3382, 3066, and 3032 points, repectively. Rookie Christine Reed captured seventh in the event with 2842 points.“The multi is an event that is unlike anything else,” Saretsky said. “One of the biggest thing we wanted to accomplish was to get our student athletes some experience, get one under the belt. It was really valuable.”Winning the high jump (1.99 meters), pole vault (4.55 meters), and hurdles (8.40 seconds), Chisam sailed to an easy victory in the heptathlon, while freshman Tyler Funk captured eighth in the event.—Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team opened up its spring season last Saturday with a down-to-the-wire thriller against Boston University. With the overall team score tied, 3-3, the final point came down to freshman Samantha Gridley’s match in the No. 5 singles position.The freshman dropped the first set, 7-6, but then forced a decisive final frame by taking the second set, 7-5. Despite a hard-fought battle, Gridley ultimately fell in the third-set tiebreaker. The defeat gave the Terriers a 4-3 victory over the Crimson.Although the loss was not the desired outcome, Harvard displayed potential in its showing, providing the Crimson players with reason for optimism.“We played a good first match,” said senior Beier Ko, who is Harvard’s No. 1 player and is currently ranked No. 64 nationally by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. “We were a little bit rusty, haven’t practiced much because of finals, and also there were some nerves. But, we did well as a group.” The match against BU started out on a high note for Harvard. In the doubles portion, the Crimson took two out of the three matches and earned the first point of the contest. In the No. 2 position, Ko and sophomore Agnes Sibilski grabbed an 8-4 victory. The freshman tandem of Gridley and Camille Jania triumphed, 8-3, in the No. 3 spot. “The doubles tactics paid off, and we executed,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “That’s one of our goals—to focus on doubles points and come out aggressively.”In the ensuing singles portion, the Crimson won two of the first four matches to take a 3-2 lead. Jania and sophomore Samantha Rosekrans suffered straight-set defeats in the No. 3 and No. 4 spots, respectively, but in the No. 1 slot, Ko easily did away with Stefanie Nunic, 6-1, 6-1. “Beier Ko is our clear No. 1,” Green said. “She was pumped up, fired up the whole match. She’s our leader out there.”At No. 6, freshman Louise Laciny edged out her opponent 6-3, 0-6, 6-2. Laciny’s win in the No. 6 position and Gridley’s battle at No. 5 are good long-term signs for the Crimson. Last season, Harvard struggled to get consistent production from the bottom of the lineup. This year, a batch of new freshmen will look to provide more depth.“I saw a lot of great things, especially out of our freshman,” Green said. “The future is bright. I think right now we have more depth this year. Anyone can be called on to pull out a win for the team.”Ko also noted the importance of the Crimson rookies.“They’ve worked really hard over the fall and really integrated,” Ko said. “They are definitely part of the team right now.”In the No. 2 position, co-captain Laura Peterzan fell 6-2, 3-6, 6-4. Gridley was the last hope for a Harvard win, but she too was bested in a close tiebreaker. It was a tough position for Gridley, who was making her collegiate dual-match debut, but her effort impressed her coach.“She hung in there all the way,” Green said. “We’re just talking about a couple points. I know she’s going to bounce back and come up even stronger.”Gridley is one of several freshmen who will make an impact for the team this season. Three first-years started against BU, and the rest have made an impression. One rookie, Holly Cao, did not play against the Terriers, but her preseason success demonstrates that she will likely be a major contributor to the middle of Harvard’s singles lineup. Sibilski may also see time in a starting singles position.The Crimson will continue its spring season in two weeks at the ECAC Team Tournament in Hanover, N.H. Harvard will play a two-month preseason schedule before starting Ivy League play in April.—Staff writer Jake I. Fisher can be reached at jifisher@fas.harvard.edu.

The Harvard ski team opened its season last weekend with a 10th-place finish at the Bates College Winter Carnival in Bethel, Maine. Men’s junior captain Christopher Kinner was the Crimson’s top finisher in the competition, placing 19th overall in the giant slalom. Kinner skied four seconds faster in the event’s second race to finish with a combined time of 2:36.62. Kinner finished just .33 seconds behind freshman Kevin McNamara in the slalom, with McNamara placing 31st overall.McNamara was 39th in the GS, while sophomore Brad Alvarez finished 46th. Sophomore Alec Boardman was 42nd in the slalom and 48th in the GS. Freshman Caroline McHugh led the way for the women’s Alpine team, coming in 35th in the GS with a combined time of 2:47.05. Meanwhile, junior captain Tess Wood was the top Harvard skier in the slalom event. Her time of 2:25.98 was good for 41st overall.On the Nordic side, sophomore Cara Sprague posted a 48th-place finish in the women’s 5K classic, clocking in at 17:38.2. Classmate Alyssa Devlin was the first Crimson skier across the finish line in the grueling 15K freestyle race, getting faster with each split and finishing in 51:59.4, good enough for 47th place. Junior Audrey Mangan and Devlin were the other Harvard scorers in the 5K, placing 53rd and 71st respectively. Sprague, placing 52nd, and Mangan, placing 64th, added points to the Crimson’s score in the 15K. Junior Trevor Petach singlehandedly carried the men’s Nordic team as the top Harvard finisher in both events. He was 75th in the 10K classic, clocking in at 31:13.0, and improved to 55th in the 20K freestyle, finishing with a time of 57:29.3.Dartmouth handily won the competition, finishing 57 points ahead of runner-up Vermont. As a team, the Big Green won four of the eight events and amassed 902 points. Harvard finished with 235 points. The Crimson will compete next at this weekend’s University of New Hampshire Carnival.— CRIMSON SPORTS STAFF

Costly turnovers, missed free throws, and a big game from an opponent’s star player proved to be too much to overcome for the Harvard men’s basketball team on Saturday. The Crimson (9-7, 1-1 Ivy) lost a disappointing game, 75-66, to woeful Dartmouth (3-11, 1-1) in overtime at Lavietes Pavillion.Though Dartmouth had been mired in an eight-game losing streak, forward Alex Barnett poured in 30 points to lead the Big Green. During the decisive overtime period, Barnett scored six of his team’s 13 points and also added a crucial steal that stopped Harvard’s comeback attempt. In the teams’ last matchup, when Harvard won at Dartmouth 63-62, Barnett was held to only nine points.“We tried, as we did before, to limit his touches,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “He’s a good player and I think he got confidence. He was in a very good rhythm and there’s not much many people in our league can do once he gets going like that.”After trailing the entire second half, Harvard pulled ahead, 57-56, with 4:32 left to play in regulation on freshman Keith Wright’s free throw. Dartmouth regained the lead, however, and held on until junior guard Jeremy Lin tied the game at 62 apiece on a layup with two seconds remaining.Captain Andrew Pusar, who scored 19 points on 8-of-11 shooting in his last game against Dartmouth, also helped with a big three-pointer down the stretch that brought the Crimson to within 62-60, setting up Lin’s late heroics. Pusar finished the game with eight points and four rebounds.Harvard was able to force overtime despite several key mistakes, including missed shots, free throws, and even a backcourt violation out of a timeout. Unfortunately, the Crimson managed only four points in overtime against Dartmouth, who forced three turnovers and several missed shots with stingy defense in the extra period. Harvard totaled 17 turnovers to Dartmouth’s six, which led to a 19-6 advantage in points off turnovers.“We had some big breakdowns and deflating plays,” Amaker said. “It was tough for us in overtime, and it was just unfortunate.”Lin once again paced the Crimson with 21 points on 7-of-14 shooting. Lin also added seven rebounds, four assists, and a devastating block in the first half that brought the crowd to its feet.With six minutes left in the first half, Lin chased down Dartmouth’s Marlon Sanders, who was streaking on a breakaway, and swatted Sanders’ layup attempt away.The game was largely controlled by the Big Green after it went on a dominating 20-5 run in the first half. The run erased Harvard’s seven-point lead, its largest, which came five minutes into the game. Dartmouth was able to score, seemingly at will, with short jumpers and aggressive drives to the basket. The Crimson was left playing catch-up the rest of the way and finally fell short in overtime.“As a team, I think we didn’t come out with the energy that they did,” Lin said. “We missed balls, and they just played tougher than us.”Junior Doug Miller was the only other Harvard player to score in double-digits.The center finished with 13 points and four rebounds in just 17 minutes of play.Forward Keith Wright had a big game on the glass with 13 rebounds, well above his 5.4-per-game average. Wright also contributed eight points.Though Harvard was coming off a 13-day break for finals, Amaker refused to let the break become an excuse.“We’re better than we played tonight,” Amaker said. “But we didn’t play as well as Dartmouth. They deserved the victory and we didn’t.”The loss is Harvard’s first after an historic first win over a ranked opponent, when they defeated then-No. 17 Boston College, 82-70, on Jan. 7. Harvard then beat Dartmouth in New Hampshire, which helped Lin, Pusar, and freshman Oliver McNally earn Ivy League honors last week.The loss also marks a disappointing start to the Ivy League component of the schedule, leaving Harvard 1-1 in conference play despite playing perennial bottom-feeder Dartmouth.“Certainly there’s a blow to us with not having coming out on top,” Amaker said. “That doesn’t mean we’re going to hang our heads and sulk about it,” the coach added. “It will inspire us to have a good week in practice.”“We don’t have any excuses,” Lin said. “We need to shake it off, come back tomorrow and just get ready for the next weekend.”Harvard’s next game is at home on Friday against Penn. —Staff writer Lucas A.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard entered Saturday night’s game against Dartmouth as the top free-throw shooting team in the Ivy League. By the end of the night, it had slipped both in the stats and in the standings.After connecting on just 17 of 27 freebies in a 75-66 overtime loss, the Crimson didn’t have to look far for an explanation. As the Big Green gained momentum by scoring on four of its first five overtime possessions, captain Andrew Pusar and junior guard Jeremy Lin each converted just one of two attempts on consecutive Harvard trips to the line.With under four minutes to go in regulation, the Crimson missed free opportunities to tie the game and close the deficit eventually erased only briefly by Pusar’s clutch three and Lin’s last-second layup.The Crimson’s troubles started and ended with Lin, who entered the game shooting at an 80-percent clip from the charity stripe. Harvard’s leading scorer shot just 6-of-11 from the line Saturday.Lin’s late-game misses both from the line and the floor betrayed fatigue, as a few of his shots just caught the front rim“I need to go back and work on that,” Lin, who still finished with 21 points to lead the Crimson, said of his shooting struggles.Dartmouth didn’t have its best night at the line either—the Big Green connected on just 63.6 percent of its free throws, including three big ones as Harvard mounted its comeback in the waning minutes of regulation.Both Lin and Harvard head coach Tommy Amaker were quick to downplay the notion that the team’s recent two-week break for exams had anything to do with its poor free throw shooting in particular or its performance overall.“Obviously the placement of [exams] doesn’t fare well for us, but it’s not an excuse,” Amaker said. “We didn’t shoot foul shots well, we didn’t take care of the ball, and if you don’t do those things in a game like this, you’re probably not going to win.”BIG MAN ON CAMPUSLin ended the night as the team’s leading scorer, but junior center Doug Miller had one of his more dominant stretches in a Crimson uniform when he scored on four of Harvard’s first six second-half possessions to pull his team to within one with 16:24 to play in regulation. The junior started with a pretty spin move in the lane for an easy two, then hit two free throws after pulling down the offensive board on a missed layup from Lin.Dartmouth star Alex Barnett followed at the other end with a tough jumper, but Miller quickly responded with two on a turnaround fall-away on the baseline. By that point, Miller’s teammates knew he was hot—on the next time down the floor, Lin found his center open under the basket for an easy lay-up.“Doug is a hard-nosed player and he’s going to come ready to play every day,” Lin said. “We’re not surprised, but we’re very thankful for that.”The final buzzer saw the junior finish with 13 points on 5-of-6 shooting in 17 minutes. Despite his hot hand, Miller found himself on the bench down the stretch at the end of regulation and in overtime. Amaker cited freshman Keith Wright’s success on the boards (13 rebounds) as the reason for Miller’s absence. Miller had four rebounds.“We went with the kind of lineup that got us into overtime,” Amaker said. “We go with the lineups that are clicking for us and matching up well for us.”Senior guard Drew Housman, who started the game alongside Miller and scored five points, was also absent during Harvard’s stretch run and played just 14 total minutes.OVERTURNEDWhile Barnett’s 30 points jumped off the stat sheet, another eye-popping statistic—turnovers—may have sealed the overtime contest in favor of the visitors. The Crimson committed 17 turnovers on the night, while the Big Green recorded just six.One botched play with 1:40 to go in regulation may have been just one of those 17, but will burn in the mind of freshman guard Peter Boehm (six points). With Harvard inbounding at midcourt and trailing by three, Boehm received the ball and promptly passed it back across the midcourt line to classmate Oliver McNally. The backcourt violation ended a Crimson scoring chance before it had even begun.“It’s disappointing some of the time, when some of the turnovers we had we didn’t feel were forced,” Amaker said. “Those are the ones that bother me the most.”Boehm—and the Crimson—was redeemed when Harvard rallied to reach overtime on Pusar and Lin’s clutch conversions. But in the extra period, the Crimson scored just four points while committing three more turnovers.“We had so many chances to win tonight,” Lin said. “We have no one to blame but ourselves.”—Staff writer Emily W.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Concluding their final dual meet before the epic Harvard-Yale-Princeton matchup this coming weekend, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team (7-0, 5-0 Ivy) celebrated its 169-119 win over Brown (1-4, 1-3) last Saturday in unusual fashion. With Black Sabbath’s “Iron Man” resonating through the speakers, freshman swimmer Matthew McLean was carried around Blodgett Pool on a stretcher for a post-meet victory lap.However, the defeat of the Bears was significant in more ways than the simple maintenance of a perfect record. The contest was also the Crimson’s Iron Man meet.The Iron Man is a freshman swimmer or diver selected by his peers who must compete in every heat of every event for the day. The layout of this year’s matchup meant that 2009 Iron Man McLean swam 4250 competitive yards in under two hours.“It’s an awesome tradition,” said McLean’s father, Mike McLean, during the meet. “Harvard’s steeped in a lot of really great traditions, and assuming Matt survives this, I’ll think it’s a great tradition.”McLean did survive, albeit barely—at the end of the meet, the freshman standout had turned a shade of crimson and was sporting ice packs on both shoulders.“It’s pretty exhausting but it’s a good indication of how intense HMSD [Harvard Men’s Swimming and Diving] is and how hard we train,” McLean said of his challenge.Although the Simsbury, Conn. native was the obvious highlight of the competition, McLean was not the only member of the Crimson team who shone against Brown. Harvard registered many standout performances on the day, capturing ten of the meet’s events.Sophomore Zac Ranta continued his spree of domination, claiming both of the meet’s diving events. Ranta placed first in the 1-meter dive with a score of 316.5 points, as well as winning the 3-meter dive with 312.23 points.Harvard also began the meet with a bang, emerging victorious in the first six swimming events.The 200-yard medley relay team of freshman Rob Newell, junior Simone Melillo, senior Bill Jones and co-captain David Guernsey claimed the event for the Crimson, touching the wall in 1:33.55.Three of the relay members were victorious in the individual events as well. Newell won the 200-yard breaststroke in 2:15.87, while Melillo took the 100-yard breaststroke in 58.51. Rounding out the order, Jones squeaked by co-captain Eric Lynch in the 200-yard freestyle, finishing in 1:40.77.The Crimson also boosted its score through the victories of junior Mason Brunnick in the 1000-yard freestyle, freshman Niall Janney in the 100-yard backstroke, and sophomore Blake Lewkowitz in the 200-yard butterfly. The three Harvard swimmers finished in times of 9:32.35, 53.05 and 1:55.08, respectively.Finally, sophomore Will Heyburn picked up the 200-yard IM for the Crimson in a time of 2:02.87, while junior Tommy Gray finished first in the 500-yard freestyle, touching the wall in 4:43.41.Although Harvard did not place first in any of the day’s remaining events, it did register the fastest time in the 100-yard butterfly. Senior Dan Jones, who swam in the non-scoring second heat of the event, finished with a time of 50.26, passing Brown’s first-place winner, Dan Ricketts, who won the first heat in 50.30.“I was pleased with the guys’ energy and their enthusiasm,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said of his team’s performance.The Crimson will look to use this energy and build on its success as it prepares to meet its toughest competition of the season, the Princeton Tigers, on Saturday at the annual HYP meet.—Staff writer Alexandra J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At 6:22 in the second period, the No. 18 Dartmouth men’s hockey team (10-7-2, 7-4-2 ECAC) scored a short-handed goal to put itself up, 3-1, against visiting Harvard (4-11-4, 4-6-4) Sunday at Thompson Arena.
At that moment, it would have been easy for the Crimson to lose hope. It would have been easy to slide back into the team’s recent habit of staying down when down. Instead, Harvard took a step in another direction. 
Though it was playing against a ranked opponent, the Crimson retaliated by scoring three unanswered goals to take a 4-3 lead early in the third period. The game eventually ended in a 5-5 tie. 
“When we were down 3-1 in the second period, it was easy to give up and say we weren’t going to win, but we really fought back and kept going and tied it up and even got the lead,” sophomore forward Mike Biega said. “It was unfortunate that they tied it up at the end, but we were happy with the result overall.”
Junior forward Doug Rogers led the team’s comeback by scoring the first of Harvard’s three unanswered tallies at 18:41 in the second with a 5-on-3 advantage. After moving the puck around with Biega, freshman forward Eric Kroshus fed the puck across the goal. Rogers was waiting on the left post and easily beat the out-of-position Big Green goaltender.
Rogers notched a hat trick and an assist to lead the Crimson’s effort in Sunday night’s tie.
“[The hat trick] was a tribute to my players for making that possible,” Rogers said.
Rogers scored again at 4:48 in the third period—less than 50 seconds after freshman forward Daniel Moriarty scored the game-tying goal—to give Harvard its first lead of the game at 4-3. Both goals were scored on power plays. 
“[The goals] were really important especially since we’ve been switching around our power plays a lot,” Biega said. “They weren’t going as well as we hoped [they] would lately and [Sunday] night our power plays blew up and we did really well. We have to be able to capitalize on the special teams and the penalty kills.”
Though the Crimson has struggled on the power play in recent games, the team scored four out of its five goals on the night with man advantages. Additionally, Harvard’s defensive unit effectively shut down Dartmouth’s special teams, killing five of the Big Green’s six power-play opportunities. 
“In NCAA hockey, special teams are very important,” Rogers said. “You need to score goals on the power play to be a successful team. It’s the same for penalty kills. NCAA hockey is special teams itself and I think it’s good that we finally started scoring goals on the power play.”
After the Big Green responded to the Crimson’s offensive explosion with a goal of its own, freshman forward Ryan Grimshaw tallied his first collegiate goal at 15:04 in the third period, giving Harvard the lead again. The rookie received the puck from junior defenseman Chad Morin before slipping it into the back of the net. 
Though the Crimson had a 15-10 advantage in shots in the third period, the defense and junior goaltender John Riley were unable to stop Dartmouth’s last-ditch efforts to score. Big Green sophomore forward Evan Stephens tallied his second goal of the game with just over three minutes to play, sending the contest into overtime. 
“I think our team was a lot happier after [Sunday] night because we’ve been struggling lately, but I think the team played much better [Sunday] night,” Biega said. “Overall, the team was a lot happier, so it’s a step in the right direction.”
Harvard will play its first game of the new semester Friday night against Union at Bright Hockey Center. 
“In practice, we’re really trying to work on and build off what we did against Dartmouth,” Rogers said. “We moved the puck well against Dartmouth. We’ve been practicing with a certain confidence and edge. We just need to keep that going forward.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson will have to wait for another day to call itself king of the Pride.The Harvard men’s volleyball team surrendered a close match, 3-2 (30-13, 18-30, 30-26, 26-30, 8-15), to Springfield, the No. 1 team in Division III, last night at the Blake Arena.“Springfield is a really tough team—they’re really well rounded,” junior co-captain Gil Weintraub said. “And in my three years of playing at Harvard, this is the best showing we’ve ever had at a Springfield game.”The Crimson was unstoppable in the first contest, shooting ahead to a 10-2 lead and holding on for the win. Nailing 13 kills for a .500 attacking percentage, Harvard overpowered the Pride by a 17-point margin for a 30-13 victory. Senior co-captain Brady Weissbourd slammed down seven kills on eight attempts and jumped up for six block assists in the opening round.“In the first game, we played our fundamentals, and it really showed in the score,” Weintraub said.But the tables turned in the next match, as the Crimson committed 11 errors and posted a negative hitting percentage in the second game. The Pride capitalized on four consecutive Harvard errors, nabbing an early 11-2 lead and holding on to finish out the match on top, 30-18.In the third game, the crosstown rivals finally appeared to be on even footing, as the lead wavered back and forth between the teams. The Crimson gained momentum after a Springfield streak of errors initiated by a kill from junior Soren Rosier, taking an 18-14 lead. Although the Pride cut the deficit to one point, 21-20, Weissbourd kills started off a 5-0 Harvard run, as the Crimson rallied for the win, 30-26.But Springfield battled back in the fourth contest, besting the Crimson, 30-26. The Pride recorded a hitting percentage of .412 and put up 19 kills, but Harvard kept the game close. With the score tied at 24, Springfield shot ahead on a 6-2 run to force the fifth and final game.Although the two squads remained neck-and-neck the entire night, Harvard finally yielded to break the tie. After a pair of Pride double-blocks, Springfield seized a 9-6 lead and didn’t look back, topping the Crimson, 15-8, for the game and the win.“They used the crowd, and we kind of gave it to them [in the fifth game], but I think our team showed a lot of potential,” Weintraub said. “We have a lot to look forward to this season.”Weissbourd led the team with 21 kills overall for a .405 hitting percentage, along with 10 block assists. Freshman Nikola Ivica posted nine digs and 15 kills, while junior Erik Kuld recorded eight digs and eight kills. Weintraub grounded the offense with 49 assists, and rookie Matt Jones registered seven kills and five digs.“It’s always tough to lose your fist game of the season, but I think since it’s so early we can take a lot of positive things out of the loss,” senior Jeff Nathan said. “Last time we played Springfield...we didn’t play very well at all. They kind of handed it to us. But tonight, we played even volleyball with them the entire time. It’s a good way to start the season.”Under the leadership of a new head coach, Brian Baise, Harvard expects to be a competitive opponent in the Hay Division in the upcoming season.“Knowing we can compete with [Springfield] and come so close to beating them gives us a boost of confidence, so as the season goes on we know we can beat anyone we can play against,” Nathan said.The Crimson looks for its first victory of the season against Stevens Institute at the Malkin Athletic Center this Saturday.—Staff writer Courtney D.
