After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two weeks ago, the Cambridge City Council passed a resolution supporting Harvard custodial staff who are seeking a contract extension. This move comes weeks after the Harvard Management Company announced that the endowment has grown by 7.3 percent this year to $41.9 billion, continuing to cement Harvard’s status as the richest university in the world. Despite the University's endowment being at its largest in history — in contrast with the "grave financial situation" experts and administrators have lamented for months — Harvard has consistently refused basic protections for the workers who make it run. Harvard pressured workers into retiring early, allegedly denied access to personal protective equipment, and forced Harvard University Dining Services workers to choose between jeopardizing the safety of their families and earning a paycheck.
Harvard is the richest it has ever been, yet continues to deny custodial staff the contract extension they are asking for in the midst of a pandemic, leveraging this crisis as an opportunity to improve the University’s bottom line. Securitas has followed suit in rejecting proposals by security guards who are subcontracted by Harvard.
The collective bargaining agreement that governs the conditions of employment for Harvard's 700 custodial and janitorial staff was set to expire in November, but has been extended to mid-December as Harvard and the union continue negotiations. Harvard workers, custodial staff included, are at high-risk for COVID-19, but continue to provide invaluable services to keep Harvard running. The pandemic has created additional challenges for their families, navigating a high-risk job while needing to arrange childcare for their children who are participating in remote schooling. Amid these difficulties, Harvard has forced the union’s hand, giving it no choice but to bargain for a new contract and forcing them to demonstrate for a fair shake at the bargaining table. Entering these negotiations, custodial staff have organized multiple rallies, asking for the basic assurance that they will not lose their jobs cleaning the world’s wealthiest school.
While Harvard has announced a new emergency policy to allow workers employed directly by the University to receive 70 percent of their pay, this proposition falls short of guaranteeing all custodians’ employment for the spring semester. Moreover, 300 custodians that are not employed directly by the University will be left out of this policy. As Cambridge city councilors have argued, not only does this jeopardize the cleanliness of our facilities, but laying off workers may lead to food insecurity, poverty, and housing insecurity for many families. The University has a responsibility to all of its workers, even those that it does not directly employ. Harvard is the client of these third-party contractors, and must extend protections to workers that fall under their auspices, even if not directly.
And speaking of third-party contractors: Securitas guards’ contract was also set to expire on Nov. 15, and the company responded with a less-than-generous offer. The guards have continued to propose simple changes that would bring their benefits and working conditions in line with other work units at the University under Harvard’s Wage and Benefit Parity Policy. Guards are still fighting for basic benefits that other unions have been offered from Harvard, including overnight differential pay and additional sick days for COVID-19-related absences. Still, Securitas has limited their offer to one year and refused to increase wages.
Harvard tends to absolve itself of any responsibility for security guards’ complaints and grievances because they fall under the purview of a third-party contractor, Securitas. Under this technical job classification, Harvard is able to claim guards are not Harvard personnel and look the other way when it comes to the majority of their outstanding concerns.
At the start of 2018, Securitas, under Harvard’s watch and tacit approval, allowed for a dramatic increase in the cost of healthcare for many guards, with some employees now paying several times more in out-of-pocket copays than before. Coping with a contagious virus under these slashed healthcare benefits has posed an uphill climb for many workers. Securitas has offered to cover the additional $48 dollars per month for each guard to maintain access to healthcare, but they have refused to allow any further discussion about copays. Many other work units on campus, however, already enjoy benefits like copay reimbursements and out-of-pocket maximums.
If the administration or Harvard community at large were to weigh in on any one of the guards’ demands, Securitas would have no choice but to listen to their client. The University’s attempts to shirk its duty to speak up make their position clear: They would prefer to let Securitas do the dirty work and bargain away wage increases or decent healthcare for guards, knowing their bottom line can only be improved by their silence.
As this pandemic rages on, Harvard has continued to devalue its workers, which makes student advocacy all the more important. Both Securitas workers and custodial staff, whether or not they are directly employed by the University, risk their safety every day to keep Harvard clean and safe, and it is our responsibility as students to stand with them.
Students have a long history of advocating for workers, including supporting the 2016 HUDS strike and the 2007 student hunger strike for contracted security workers to obtain a living wage. This spring will also mark the 20th Anniversary of the Occupation of Massachusetts Hall in 2001, during which dozens of students held a sit-in for three weeks to protest the low wages paid to janitorial, food service, and maintenance workers.
While remote advocacy is difficult, over 1000 students, staff, and faculty have already signed a petition in support of Harvard’s workers. As opposed to demonstrating in person, as we might in a typical semester, students must turn to other modes of activism — the members of the Student Labor Action Movement have been calling and emailing University officials to ask for a fair contract. We must stand up where Harvard has not to demand worker protections for these members of our community.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Since the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election, pressure has mounted on President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. to grant relief for the vast amount of student debt Americans are saddled with, standing at $1.6 trillion — around the size of Canada’s economy.
This should be a bipartisan cause. Of course, it’s not. But despite likely political resistance and resulting entrenchment, the Biden-Harris administration should alleviate that trillion-dollar burden 45 million Americans are tasked with carrying.
Education is not any typical business investment. Having an intellectually curious and critically minded citizenry is crucial for a functioning democracy. And as we’ve written before, expanding education has the ability to level an otherwise highly unequal societal playing field.
Student loans are never merely a monetary transaction. If someone’s family can’t afford to send them to (an increasingly expensive) college, it seems unfair to either deny them a shot at social mobility or to saddle them with debt that will haunt the next 20-plus years of their postgraduate life — roughly the average repayment period. Two out of ten Americans paying off student loans were behind on their payments in 2018 according to Federal Reserve data. Especially in the pandemic economy, minimizing the financial burden of higher education is both wise fiscal policy —can you say “economic stimulus”? — and much-needed relief for Americans of all ages and walks of life.
As some have pointed out, it's inevitable that some student loan borrowers will need debt relief more than others, but that should not be an argument against a comprehensive policy. Stunting an initiative that would benefit millions of Americans over fears of delivering a “hand out” to a few speaks to a false belief that the government has somehow failed if it happens to help those who might not necessarily need particular assistance. First, such an argument raises questions about who counts as “deserving.” And second, it distracts from the good a broad-based and inclusive program can do.
Yet relieving student debt, no matter how large an amount, won’t solve the underlying financial inequities of higher education. Meaningful institutional change needs to follow that would reconsider how we value and finance education.
The problem isn’t merely socioeconomic either — it’s racial. 90 percent of Black students and 72 percent of Latino students use loans to pay for college, compared to just 66 percent of white students, and Black borrowers are twice as likely to default on student loans as white borrowers.
Historical injustices perpetrated by the federal government and private enterprise bear much of the blame. A clear line can be drawn between aspiring Black homeowners being swindled out of fair home financing for most of the 20th century and the racial wealth gaps we see in the United States today. The median net worth of Black Bostonians is $8 compared to a white $247,500. Student loans are part of this ongoing history. And as long as predatory student loan practices are allowed to compound systemic inequities, the problem will only grow.
It is not lost on us that wealthy universities like Harvard are able to offer their students significantly more financial aid than other institutions. By and large, this means that students privileged with a Harvard education are also privileged with not having to accrue as much debt as their peers.
But students should not have to emerge victorious from the rat race that is Ivy League admissions in order to be freed from 20 years of crippling debt. The outcomes of a flawed admissions process should not have so much to bear on a student’s future financial health — leaving them to drown in debt after not receiving acceptance to the most selective institutions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies awarded four Latin American photographers and journalists in their open call competition for work about the COVID-19 pandemic.
Curated in collaboration with ReVista — the Harvard Review of Latin America — a jury of five Harvard-affiliated scholars, curators, and artists reviewed 200 submissions from the region. Jurists selected photographs they thought accurately captured “the collective isolation” of the pandemic.
Marcela V. Ramos, who serves as the art, film and culture program manager for the Rockefeller Center said her desire to help Latin American artists who may have been struggling informed the decision to host the open exhibition, citing the pandemic as an obstacle to hosting in-person exhibitions.
“At some point, we thought: ‘What can we do to help and support, in my case, the arts?’” Ramos said. “Because the exhibitions were not possible in situ as we used to, we view arts as one of the areas in which [it] was very complicated for people to continue their jobs and definitely have less opportunities.”
The four competition winners hail from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru.
Rodrigo Abd, an Argentine photojournalist based out of Lima, Peru, won first place for his collection of photos documenting the grave toll of the virus on the latter country’s domestic and migrant workers.
In one of his entries, Abd made it a point to demonstrate that Peru suffered from one of the worst COVID-related death tolls, impacting vulnerable Venezuelan migrant workers who have to collect dead bodies.
Yan Boechat, a Brazilian journalist who scored third place in the open exhibition, submitted one photo from his series "Manaus: Death in the Amazon."
In Boechat’s submission, a distressed woman grasps her chest as bystanders shout to get medical attention. Brazil’s COVID-19 death toll is second only to the United States’ with more than 171,000 people dead as of Nov. 28, according to the Associated Press.
June C. Erlick, ReVista’s Editor-in-Chief, noted that picking Abd and Boechat’s photos for the exhibition would work to draw the press's attention to the pandemic’s effects on Latin America’s working class.
“I think when you read about Latin America, and there's not that much to read about Latin America, in U.S. media these days,” Erlick said. “These images are a way of conveying that situation.”
“The title, collective isolation is certainly true in the United States, as we're practicing social distancing, and wearing our masks and not going to parties and, you know, not hanging out at Bartley’s, but in much of Latin America, people couldn't even go out of their homes, unless they were essential workers,” she added.
Both Erlick and Ramos emphasized that history was another motivating factor behind the photo exhibition’s conception.
“We’re living in a very unusual situation right now,” Erlick said. “Where generally, whenever we go through a crisis, like a war, you’re not thinking about how are people in the future are going to look back and see this crisis, and understand this pandemic, and remember this pandemic.”
“This could make a difference in terms of historical memory,” Ramos said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health epidemiologist Megan B. Murray said the U.S. faces a grim period as the coronavirus surges nationwide, but noted optimism signs regarding vaccine development during a Tuesday Q&A with journalist Elana Gordon.
Murray answered questions from Facebook Live viewers on the current landscape of the coronavirus pandemic during the event, which was presented jointly by the School of Public Health and The World, a nationally syndicated public radio show hosted by Boston NPR affiliate WGBH.
Murray said American Thanksgiving celebrations could lead to a rise in coronavirus cases and deaths, particularly due to mixing age groups.
“We’re expecting that today might be the beginning of a surge about five or six days out from Thanksgiving,” she said. “If there were infections that took place then, they would start to become symptomatic around now. That will continue over the next few days and then there will be secondary and tertiary cases.”
Gordon asked Murray to describe recently discovered insights into how the virus functions, including why some people seem to get sicker than others.
“I think it’s increasingly clear that there is a potential genetic signal, especially if you look at people who are completely unaffected and people who are really sick,” Murray said.
Many audience members’ questions focused on potential vaccines. Murray noted there are significant logistical challenges associated with some of the vaccine candidates, citing a Pfizer vaccine that must be stored at -94 degrees Fahrenheit.
“There’s many rural parts of the U.S. that don’t have hospitals or health care facilities that have access to a freezer that can store vaccines at that temperature,” Murray said.
“Fortunately for us, there’s a lot of variety in the kinds of vaccines that can be made,” she added, noting that other vaccine candidates — including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — do not appear to require extreme temperature controls.
Gordon asked Murray to evaluate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield’s claim that some Americans could begin to receive vaccinations by mid-December.
“I think surprisingly, it is realistic to assume that as soon as there’s FDA emergency use authorization, that the rollout will happen,” Murray said, adding that the timeline will also be contingent on manufacturing speed and the distribution plan.
Other audience questions covered topics such as the need for deep nasal swabbing during coronavirus tests, whether the United States actually has the most cases in the world, and the possible effects on herd immunity from Americans who oppose vaccinations.
Gordon concluded by asking about the similarities between the subject of Murray’s previous research, tuberculosis, and the coronavirus. Murray mentioned that research on tuberculosis is neglected despite its high prevalence in certain, typically low-income parts of the world, in contrast to the rapid research and promising vaccine development for the coronavirus.
“It’s a story about poverty and I’m hoping that the world will take a lesson from this that its problems can be solved,” Murray said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Salomé Garnier ’22, who is spending the semester living in a Somerville apartment with three Harvard friends and frequently babysitting for a local family, getting tested for COVID-19 is all but a necessity.
When the University expanded its coronavirus testing program in September to enrolled undergraduates living in the greater Cambridge area, she was one of 484 College students invited to participate. These off-campus students make up a share of the students forgoing Harvard housing this semester to live in rentals within the Cambridge and Greater Boston area.
The University mailed students who opted in to the pilot program — launched in the wake of reported interactions between on- and off-campus students — eight self-administered test kits to last through Nov. 22. Participants were asked to drop off their samples at the Harvard University Health Services clinic each week.
“I think it’s really great that they just send us the tests to our home and we have our stock for the whole semester,” Garnier said. “Most often, I would wake up the next day with the results, so I think that’s definitely on the quicker range of test results.”
Nazeli I. Hagen ’21, who rented an apartment near Harvard Yard with three other seniors, similarly said test results delivered through Color, a health testing company that serves University affiliates, consistently returned within 24 hours.
Upon learning that one of her roommates received a positive rapid COVID-19 test result after flying home for Thanksgiving, Hagen said the reliably brief wait time under Harvard’s testing system allowed her to submit a test sample and receive a negative result the next morning, ensuring that she could visit her family that day.
“It was absolutely the only option for getting a test that fast. My other two roommates also got tested, but they were in New York and they still don’t have results,” she said. “It really, really made a difference.”
Shayna T. Grossman ’23, who has been staying with two blockmates in a North Cambridge apartment, said she participated in the off-campus screening program because she wanted the “peace of mind that testing affords.”
“Getting a test once a week and validating the fact that I don’t have COVID just made me feel a little more at ease,” she said.
With the program at its end, some students are looking to secure their own tests without school support, especially before they leave the area for winter break.
“I just don’t know where I’m going to get tests now,” Grossman said. “Now I have to figure out what my local testing facility is and I might have to go in person and wait in a waiting room with other people, which makes me a little nervous.”
“Maybe the easiest thing for me is to just quarantine for two weeks instead,” she added.
Garnier, who hails from France, said she anticipates testing herself once more before leaving the United States and receiving another test after arriving overseas.
“I will probably get tested right when I get there, just because getting tested in France is so easy and free,” she said. “But then while I’m there, I doubt I’ll actually be leaving my house much — the whole country is basically in lockdown — so I probably won’t need testing.”
Wassim Marrakchi ’21, who also lived with three Harvard students in Somerville this semester, said he will probably need to forgo his regular testing regimen at home in Tunisia.
“Back home, I don’t think that’s really an option,” he said. “You actually have to show symptoms to get tested back home because testing is limited.”
Despite uncertainty about non-Harvard testing resources among some of her peers, Hagen said she has already identified a free testing site in Harvard Square set up by the City of Cambridge that she plans to utilize this month.
While the University has yet to announce whether the pilot program will be renewed for the spring semester, HUHS Director Giang T. Nguyen wrote in an emailed statement that “HUHS and University leadership are currently assessing the off-site COVID testing pilot and we will update the community with our plans for the Spring term once we've completed our review.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences hopes to pilot some in-person academic experiences in the spring of 2021, though instruction will remain remote by default, FAS Dean Claudine Gay said during a faculty meeting Tuesday.
Limited in-person advising or teaching would allow the FAS to experiment with how to hold such events safely, in anticipation of nearly all students returning to campus in fall 2021, according to Gay.
“We also will be looking for opportunities and faculty volunteers to pilot some in-person academic experiences so we can begin to work through the logistics of doing that safely,” she said. “And here, I’m thinking ahead to next fall, when some aspects of the pandemic may still be with us, but we hope to be operating as close to full capacity as possible.”
Gay added that the limited in-person advising some freshmen received this fall proved successful. Expanding that, or permitting certain courses to have an in-person element, would allow the FAS to experiment with the types of courses, rooms, and health and safety measures, eventually allowing for greater face-to-face engagement in the fall.
Harvard announced earlier Tuesday that it would expand its residential capacity for the spring semester, allowing all seniors and many juniors to return to living on campus, though teaching will remain virtual. Students living on campus must follow stringent health measures.
Gay said during the faculty meeting that the FAS hopes to open up access to non-residential common spaces for students living on campus faster than it did this fall. Additionally, she said the FAS has “not foreclosed” the possibility that some students living off campus might be able to access research facilities, something the University did not allow this semester.
Harvard administrators are also beginning to shape policies around vaccination distribution and policies amid news that two U.S. vaccines are nearing government approval, University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said during the meeting.
Garber said there is “no controversy” that healthy college students will be among the last in line to receive the coronavirus vaccine, making it likely that some students will be vaccinated and others will not by next fall. He said it’s also important to consider that inoculating healthy Harvard students could keep the vaccine from reaching less developed parts of the world that need it.
As a result, Harvard needs to decide whether to allow students who have not received the vaccine to attend in-person classes next fall, while considering that some students cannot or will decline to be vaccinated, Bacow said. In response to a faculty question on whether the University would require vaccinations, Bacow said a committee led by Garber will begin exploring such questions at the end of this week.
The faculty also approved Harvard Summer School’s 2021 course list during its Tuesday meeting. HSS will not offer summer study abroad programs in 2021.
Also during Tuesday's meeting, Sheree Ohen — the FAS’s first Associate Dean of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging — spoke about the diversity and inclusion work of several groups, including the Staff Diversity Committee, Faculty Liaisons for Inclusive Excellence, DIB Graduate Student Fellows, FAS DIB Leadership Council, and the Task Force on Visual and Cultural Signage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda K. L. Ardern shared her vision for leadership before a record-breaking audience of thousands at a virtual John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum on Tuesday — the largest since the event series moved online in March.
Ardern recently accepted the 2020 Gleitsman International Activist Award, joining the company of Malala Yousafzai and Nelson R. Mandela in receiving the honor, which is given annually in recognition of leadership in social activism.
Ardern and moderator Wendy R. Sherman, a Kennedy School professor who directs the school’s Center for Public Leadership, discussed topics ranging from pandemic response to being a woman in politics. University President Lawrence S. Bacow concluded the forum with a brief speech comparing the prime minister to the late U.S. Representative John R. Lewis.
Ardern opened her remarks with personal reflections on how she became a leader. She admitted that, growing up, she never thought she would become a member of Parliament. Her classmates joked that she would be, however; she was even awarded “Most Likely to be Prime Minister” in her school yearbook.
“I haven't always been the best at self-promotion,” she said with a laugh.
Though she didn’t initially aspire to them, Ardern landed in positions of leadership and eventually rose to the position of Prime Minister in 2017. However, she said she did not have her sights set specifically on landing the role and instead found herself as an executive after choosing to be herself and saying “yes” to opportunities.
Sherman said in an interview following the forum that she was particularly impressed with Ardern’s candor and humility.
“I was so inspired and so taken by her transparency, her accessibility, her humanity,” said Sherman. “She told stories about herself that make people feel like — certainly made me feel like — I was really hearing her. That she was telling me the story about herself, not just as a prime minister, but as a human being.”
Ardern spoke about the values at the foundation of her leadership style. She said she wants to impart such qualities to her daughter, including empathy, thoughtfulness and generosity — ideals she believes citizens must expect more from adults in power.
Ardern said she hopes these traits — and not traditional gender norms — will shape young people’s leadership ambitions.
“We still have young people, especially young women, who don't necessarily see themselves in the leadership traits of our politicians,” she said. “And that's something I want to change.”
For Ardern, leadership isn’t about personal ambition or being the “loudest person in the room.”
“You can believe in consensus more than you believe in conflict. You can be human. You can feel and show emotion. You can be kind, empathetic and strong,” Ardern said. “You can and indeed, you must, be your own kind of leader.”

From the shores of Barbados to the mountains of Pennsylvania, Harvard students scattered across the globe to attend classes this semester.
Harvard’s decision to house mostly first-year students for the fall semester motivated many upperclassmen students to search for off-campus housing. Many found rentals in the Cambridge and Boston area and spent their semesters near campus, taking advantage of on-campus testing and a proximity to their old Houses.
For others, however, living near campus was not an option. While some lived at home with parents and siblings, others chose to find housing with their blockmates in various parts of the world. Whether or not students were able to live with others, and despite their different locations, many shared similar fall semester experiences.
For many international students, time zones proved to be a major challenge throughout the semester.
Gaurang Goel ’22, a student living in Hong Kong, said living so far away from campus made it extremely difficult for him to seek academic help.
“The time zone difference is 12 hours and after daylight savings, it became 13 hours,” he said. “It becomes challenging to make office hours, so I often have to request different times for office hours.”
Besides academic challenges, clubs and extracurriculars posed a burden for Goel. He said they are “harder to schedule” because of the time differences. However, he said, Harvard faculty have worked hard to make sure that international students like him are not forgotten.
“The professors and [teaching fellows] have been incredibly accommodating and understanding, so that is really helpful,” Goel said.
Samuel H. Taylor ’24, was less positive about his time studying off campus.
“What’s life like?” he said. “Frustrating and isolating are probably the two words I pick up on most.”
Taylor described the problems with the time difference between his home in New Zealand and Cambridge. He said he eventually realized that staying up until 3 a.m. for classes was not “sustainable.” According to Taylor, there were only two freshman seminars compatible with his time zone, and he had to drop a class due to the time difference.
This summer, the College announced that due to federal visa restrictions, incoming international freshmen would not be allowed on campus. Throughout the fall, international students struggled adjusting to large time zone differences, managing their classes, and juggling extracurricular responsibilities.
Taylor said that Harvard has “definitely not” done enough to support him and other students off campus.
“There's been a real lack of communication about what the future looks like,” Taylor said. “I appreciate that they may not know things very quickly, because it's a very complex legal situation and everything. But the fact that we've had next to no communication, and we've been kind of suffering through this for months and months now is pretty appalling.”
Palis Pisuttisarun ’24 spent the semester in Bangkok, Thailand, with his family. He said he was not pleased with the way Harvard has dealt with its international students. He added that he is disappointed with what he believes is a lack of transparency about future plans.
“The fact that Harvard hasn't done that or hasn't announced that they will do that is pretty upsetting, given that they have pretty much infinite resources to expend as compared to these other institutions,” he said.
In an email, College spokesperson Rachael Dane pointed to past comments made by Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay that a decision would be announced in December. On Tuesday, Harvard met this deadline, announcing a spring residence plan favoring seniors and enrolled juniors.
Dane also wrote that the Dean of Students Office student engagement team worked with the Office of International Education to develop ways to facilitate social connections for students living in challenging time zones.
While time zone issues may not have been an issue for all students, the costs and planning that went into living off-campus was a challenge that many students had to tackle throughout the semester.
Franck T. Germain ’22, a student living in Jersey City, N.J. with his five blockmates, broke down the budgeting and planning they undertook in order to be able to afford to live off campus.
“We had to set budgets on how much we were going to spend on food for each month,” Germain said. “At Harvard whenever you need a meal you can go to the dining hall, but here we have to calculate how we are going to split up the food.”
Germain also explained how working over the summer helped him to cover the expenses of living away from home.
“The biggest difference is that we have to be extremely conscious of what we were spending our money on,” Germain said.
Nestled in the Poconos Mountains, Davis Tyler-Dudley ’21 chose to live with eight other Harvard students — including his blockmates — in Jim Thorpe, Penn. He said he initially had reservations about living off-campus, but — to his surprise — he thoroughly enjoyed living with his friends.
“I was a little worried at first, because I knew that doing remote school was going to be a little strange,” Tyler-Dudley said. “But, I really enjoyed being with my blocking group and being with some of my closest friends from school.”
Tyler-Dudley also said he found it much easier to take his classes in an environment with other students also doing remote learning, compared to studying at home.
“It is a little easier to do classes when you are not in a place where no one else is doing school,” Tyler-Dudley said. “I recognize that living with friends is not possible for everyone, so I am thankful for that opportunity. It has really helped me.”
With students spread far and wide, social life took a different form this semester. In a semester of virtual interaction, students discovered issues finding opportunities to socialize.
For Pisuttisarun, being at home with family has been a comfort, but it still had its limits. He said interacting with family can be “draining,” especially having lived with them his entire life.
“I feel like this is a period of time I have my own growth curve, where I'm supposed to be moving away from them, I'm supposed to be independent,” he said. “That's kind of contrasting against the fact that I see my mom 15 hours a day, and that's a little bit disappointing.”
As a senior, Tyler-Dudley said he believed remote learning was much easier for him compared to freshmen. He explained how his involvement in clubs, such as the Harvard International Relations Council, along with the friendships made during his time at the College, has allowed him to be able to stay connected with his peers.
“I have heard from first-year students especially that it has been a struggle to feel a sense of the Harvard community,” Tyler-Dudley said.
Contemplating their plans for the spring semester, Tyler-Dudley said “the state of the pandemic” will influence his and his blockmates’ decision to go back to campus.
“If it does not seem like on-campus will be a good way to enjoy our senior year experience, I think that we might opt for maybe pursuing off-campus housing in Boston,” Tyler-Dudley said. “Living off-campus with my friends is an immense privilege that has made 2020 significantly better for me.”
For some international students, however, the vast distances have made it easy to feel isolated from friends and peers, making social interactions an exhausting task.
Maia L. Hollins-Kirk ’24 spent the semester in Barbados with two other international students. She said programs geared towards encouraging international student engagement felt mundane and tedious.
“They have done things like international reach out programs, but they're just painful,” she said. “I don't go to them anymore, because they weren't adding any benefit.”
She suggested mandatory social meetings as a way to assist students off campus who are struggling to socialize, but recognized that this may not be much fun.
Taylor said he felt disconnected, both physically and socially, from other students. With the majority of his class living on campus, he said he found it especially hard to connect.
“Of course, it is very hard to connect with people who live on campus because the last thing they want to do is spend all their time talking to people online,” Taylor said. “So there is no connection there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Co-founders of the “Final Bow for Yellowface” project discussed their efforts to confront and remove caricature-like portrayals of Asians in classical ballet at a virtual event hosted by Houghton Library Tuesday.
Phil Chan, author of “Final Bow For Yellowface: Dancing Between Intention and Impact,” began the panel discussion, which was moderated by Harvard English Professor Ju Yon Kim, by outlining the rise of yellowface and Asian caricature in ballet starting in the 1950’s.
“It doesn’t mean they’re not sort of beautiful in their own way, but the mannerisms, the accentuation of the race, really make this problematic in terms of the impact on actual Asian Americans,” Chan said.
New York City Ballet soloist Georgina Pazcoguin, a Filipina American dancer and the first Asian American to be promoted to an upper tier in her company, said she became acutely aware of her “otherness” as soon as she joined the company at the age of 17.
“In a lot of the critiques, they made it very much about my body, but just specifically comments about my makeup — ‘can you make your makeup look less Oriental?’” she said.
When Pazcoguin was cast in the Chinese Dance — a number in the renown ballet production "The Nutcracker" that includes geisha wigs, chopstick-like fan movements, and finger-pointing gestures — she said she felt conflicted.
“I immediately felt that something was wrong. But I couldn’t voice at the age of 20, I couldn’t say no, I’m not going to do this part because it doesn’t represent Asian culture,” she said.
Once she was promoted to soloist, however, Pazcoguin said she finally felt empowered to speak out.
“I feel like I have the power to approach Jon Stafford — the current artistic director of New York City Ballet — to say, ‘Hey, can we open up a discussion about this because this is how it’s impacting me, and I’m sure I’m not the only one experiencing this,’” she said.
Both Chan and Pazcoguin said they do not want to replace the work of Balanchine, the founder of the New York City Ballet and its first artistic director. Instead, they said they want to implement simple changes that do away with the appropriation of Asian culture in dance.
“If we want people of color to come into our spaces and feel welcome, yet we still present this outdated, Eurocentric portrayal of their culture, those two things are not congruent,” Chan said. “So we’ve really got to ask ourselves, what are we saving in the name of tradition?”
The majority of Asian ballet dancers either train in Asia before joining an American ballet company or are biracial — like Chan and Pazcoguin — and could therefore “pass” for white, according to Chan, which signaled to him that American dance institutions do not sufficiently invest in Asian Americans.
Chan also cited the model minority myth — the idea of Asian Americans keeping their heads down and working hard — as a reason why more Asian American dancers have not spoken up about racism in the industry. By speaking up, he said some Asian American dancers may feel “shame or guilt.”
“There’s a lot of darker people of color that aren’t even in these companies, so at least we’re in this space and getting a paycheck,” Chan said. “There’s also been less of a push for advocacy for Asian Americans to essentially rock the boat because we have had some degree of acceptance, and the little scrap we’ve been thrown — maybe that’s enough for now.”
Every major American ballet company has signed the project’s pledge, which reads, “I love ballet as an art form, and acknowledge that to achieve diversity among our artists, audiences, donors, students, volunteers, and staff requires inclusion. I am committed to eliminating outdated and offensive stereotypes of Asians (Yellowface) on our stages.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The First Circuit Court of Appeals released an opinion in November affirming a district court ruling from last fall that Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies do not violate civil rights law, marking the latest development in the long-standing lawsuit brought against Harvard by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions.
Now, as SFFA President Edward J. Blum pledges to further appeal the suit, legal experts say they are confident SFFA will try to take the case to the Supreme Court. They also say that if that effort succeeds, the Court’s virtually unprecedented conservative makeup would prove a threat to race-conscious admissions and longstanding precedent in affirmative action.
SFFA first sued Harvard in 2014, alleging that the College’s admissions process illegally discriminates against Asian American applicants. Last fall, the District Court released a decision in the University’s favor which SFFA appealed in February.
SFFA and Harvard virtually presented oral arguments in the appeal in October, and the judges released another opinion in Harvard’s favor last month. Here’s what experts say lies ahead.
The more than 100-page opinion consisted of First Circuit judges Jeffrey R. Howard and Sandra L. Lynch’s analysis of previous allegations SFFA brought against Harvard. Experts say the opinion affirmed the factual findings of the District Court and relied heavily on Supreme Court precedent.
Deborah Archer, a professor at NYU School of Law, praised the opinion's thoroughness, emphasizing that it filled in potential loopholes in the District Court’s original decision.
“I think there were two places where I think the District Court was not as strong in the opinion as it could have been, and those are on the intentional discrimination claims that SFFA filed, and the First Circuit was very much in favor of Harvard on that,” said Archer. “The First Circuit also went a little deeper in explaining the deficits in SFFA’s experts’ modeling and went further in critiquing their expert witness reports.”
“It was an incredibly thorough opinion that was 100 percent in favor of Harvard,” Archer said.
Nancy Leong, a professor at University of Denver Sturm College of Law, said the First Circuit opinion may have focused on precedent in anticipation of the case reaching the Supreme Court.
“My read is that the First Circuit in writing this opinion, likely thought that it could, or perhaps was likely to be heard by the Supreme Court,” Leong said.
“The appellate court reviews the district court's factual findings for clear error, which is a deferential standard,” Leong said. “It was able to actually see these witnesses and assess their credibility in a way that neither the First Circuit nor potentially the Supreme Court would be able to. And so what the first circuit is very careful to emphasize throughout its opinion is that these factual findings deserve deference.”
SFFA can request another review by the First Circuit, or file directly to the Supreme Court.
While scholars found it difficult to predict how each justice would rule if the Supreme Court took up the case, they agreed that the court’s conservative skew made an outcome favoring SFFA more likely.
“The losing party in any case can request en banc review, which would be reviewed by all of the active judges on the First Circuit,” Leong said.
“The First Circuit is pretty liberal. If I were trying for a moment to put myself in Edward Blum’s shoes, I'm not sure that I would take the step of seeking en banc review,” Leong added. “He might just bypass a request for en banc review and file for the Supreme Court.”
To reach the Supreme Court, SFFA would have to file a petition for certiorari — a mechanism by which a losing party appeals to a higher court.
Theodore M. Shaw, professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law, laid out the process.
“They have to file a petition to certiorari sometime within a few months after the opinion of the First Circuit. I don't think anybody has much doubt that they're going to do that,” Shaw said. “There'll be a period of time in which the folks at Harvard will have to file a brief in opposition to certiorari, which no doubt they will do.”
“There are now three appointees to the Supreme Court by President Trump, and none of those three, to my knowledge has a record yet in cases like this involving issues of race, admissions and higher education,” Shaw said. “But as I've indicated, this is the most conservative court that the Supreme Court that we've seen in decades.”
Some experts said they believe that if the Supreme Court were to take the case, it might indicate larger motives.
“If the Supreme Court agrees to hear this case, it’s not going to be because of a question about whether or not Harvard complied with the law, it’ll be because justices on the Supreme Court want to change the law,” Archer said.
Others, like Tufts sociology professor Natasha K. Warikoo, said they believe the court has little reason to take the case.
“I don’t think there’s anything that would compel the Court to take the case,” Warikoo said.
Shaw predicted SFFA would continue to argue that the College’s personal rating disadvantages Asian American applicants and that the process contains intentional discrimination, but that similar points would not constitute a strong case.
“When you have two lower courts, the trial court and court of appeals, ruling in the same way, generally that makes it more likely that the Supreme Court is going to respect what happened below,” Shaw said.
Experts explained that there is no set time period in which the Supreme Court would have to rule on a petition, and that they could discuss it more than once.
“I would expect that if they grant cert, that it’s going to be set over for briefing and argument. The briefing may occur over the summer months, maybe in the fall, and it will be set by argument sometime in the '21, '22 term.”
While some experts said there may be legitimate counts of discrimination against Asian Americans raised in the case, all agreed that an end to race-conscious admissions as SFFA sees fit would not be the best solution.
“The First Circuit made clear that Asian American students are negatively impacted by certain forms of systemic and structural racism, just like other non white students are. And that is that impacts them in the way that it impacts other students of color,” Archer said.
“I think it should cause universities to take a look at some of the pieces of our admissions programs that are seen as standard and see that the way that they detrimentally impact students of color,” Archer added. “Legacy admissions and preferences for children of faculty, athletic preferences, all of those things have a negative impact on students of color.”
Shaw emphasized the importance of affirmative action in correcting a long history of discrimination for students of color.
“There's no symmetry between efforts to continue consciously to overcome a long and sad legacy of discrimination and inequality on one hand, and, on the other hand, efforts to be inclusive,” Shaw said. “To say as some do...that it’s impossible to tell the difference between actions that aim at one of those things as opposed to another is a kind of willful blindness at best.”
“It’s gouging out our eyes and closing our eyes if we can’t tell the difference between those things,” Shaw said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College’s Tuesday announcement that it would prioritize bringing upperclassmen back to campus this spring drew a broad range of reactions — excitement, shock, and disappointment among them — from students.
Harvard administrators wrote in an email Tuesday that the College will expand the number of undergraduates invited to live on campus next semester, including seniors and juniors who enrolled this fall. The College plans to use all undergraduate bedrooms this spring, allowing for 3,100 students to return as they continue to take online classes.
In addition to seniors and currently enrolled juniors, Harvard will also prioritize petitions from students who were already invited to live on campus due to special circumstances, those who reside in a time zone four or more hours away from Eastern Standard Time, or those with “learning environment needs” this spring. After reviewing student petitions, the College will also consider bringing back juniors on leave this semester.
Prashanth “PK” Kumar '21 said he was “very happy" with the announcement that seniors could return to campus for their final semester. Still, he said he was waiting on additional details to help him make an informed decision about whether to take the College up on its offer.
“If we're going to live on campus, we want to know more about what that entails,” Kumar said, citing questions about whether returning students can choose their roommates. He suggested that, depending on the answer, he might prefer to rent a Cambridge-area apartment with friends.
Still, he said, he is leaning towards spending his final semester in Harvard housing.
“We all want to be normal Harvard students for another semester before having to go on and live on our own and cook for ourselves,” he said.
Whether seniors choose to live on campus or in nearby apartments, Samyra C. Miller ’21 said the proximity of her peers will be conducive to class bonding — something she is charged with facilitating in her role as the senior class’s first marshal.
“It's good that we will have the senior class on campus — not everyone, but lots of seniors on campus — which will make our job of fostering and building community at least slightly easier than it would have been if everyone was all over the world again,” she said.
Zeel M. Patel ’22, a currently enrolled junior who intends to return to campus this spring, said he was excited — albeit surprised — by the decision.
“I think this is something that caught me by surprise,” he said. “I had plans ready for next semester, where I was going to be interning at a company out in New York City. I actually had talked to them and signed the offer letter and had the dates ready, and I was about to look for housing. And then this email came.”
Patel said he is trying, now, to defer the internship to a later semester so that he can enroll this semester and come back to Cambridge.
“One of the big draws now is it's very likely that most of my friends who are juniors will come back to campus, or just be in the general Boston vicinity,” he said.
But like Kumar, he said he is unsure whether he should live on campus or find an apartment with friends in the area. He said his ultimate decision is contingent on forthcoming information about the spring’s dining situation and social life.
Emmy Semprun ’22, a junior who took time off this fall, said she was disappointed to hear that, though juniors on leave can petition to live on campus, they would have lower priority for receiving housing. She added, however, that she understood the reasoning behind the decision.
“There's only so much housing and there's a lot of people who took time off,” she said. “They warned us about this when we did take time off that we might not be guaranteed housing. I'm still disappointed but also understand because they made sure to tell us this when we took time off.”
During a webinar about leaves of absence in early July, Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt ’01 told students that Harvard could not guarantee students taking a leave in the fall campus dorms upon their return.
Semprun, who is living off-campus near Harvard this semester, also said she is excited about the prospect of more of her classmates returning to Harvard.
“The announcement does impact my decision to still live near campus in the spring because I would want to be around if all the other juniors were coming back,” she said.
Jaxson T. Hill ’23 said he was “not surprised” that Harvard chose to invite seniors to live in residence and prioritize enrolled juniors, though he still found it upsetting that he and most of the sophomore class would have to spend more than a full year away from campus.
“In their email, they acknowledged that sophomores were getting the short end of the stick,” he said. “And the email seemed to imply that summer school classes were sufficient consolation.”
Harvard reiterated its fall announcement that all enrolled undergraduate students who spend the entire 2020-21 academic year off-campus will be eligible to take two tuition-free courses at the Harvard Summer School in the summer of 2021.
Madison M. Pankey ’24 said that although she was saddened by the College’s decision not to invite freshmen to return in the spring, she anticipated the news.
“I mean, we were already on campus right? To me, it didn't really make sense for us to be first priority,” she said.
Pankey said she will spend the spring in an apartment with friends she made this fall.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in an email Tuesday that the College will convene a panel discussion Wednesday during which students can learn more about Harvard’s plans for the spring term.
Khurana will speak on the panel in conversation with Dean of Undergraduate Education Amanda J. Claybaugh, interim Cabot House Resident Dean Meghan Lockwood, who is also serving as a special advisor to the Dean’s Office for COVID-19, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair.
“I think that'll definitely be an avenue for people to get answers,” Miller said of the panel discussion.
“If you can't attend, watch recordings or talk to friends. The information is being put out there,” she offered as advice to her peers. “Be very vigilant and read things and attend things.”

Sections
With the end of the semester in sight, naturally we’re starting to think about our finals (or that delicious apple pie you had at Thanksgiving). While some professors have chosen to go with normal final exams (or as normal as things can be when your classes are entirely virtual) others, unfortunately, have chosen to grace us with the few circumstances that make taking a final from your childhood bedroom in your parents’ house even harder. In just a few short weeks, you and I will find ourselves taking some of these unfortunate exams thinking, “dude… that’s rude.”
Group Projects
This might seem like the hottest of takes, but hear me out: group projects are actually worse than a plain old final exam. Not only do they require a substantial amount of time and effort to complete (at least a test is over in 90 minutes, right?), but they’re difficult too. Somehow the fact that we have a week or two to work on these has convinced some of our professors that we are suddenly capable of solving climate change or curing cancer all in a short eight-page final essay.
Now onto the worst part of the final group project: the group. We’ve all been the one person in the group who does the entire assignment — you’d think that once you got to Harvard, your days of being the group project dictator would be over, but you were so wrong. The problems that come with working in a group are only exacerbated by being online. But hey, just because I can’t aggressively stare at you during section until you admit how little you’ve done won’t stop me from spamming you with texts until I see edits on the shared Google Doc. Needless to say, group projects are quite literally the devil in disguise.
Exams Right Before/After Move-Out
Normally, an exam right before Thanksgiving is fair game (sort of). While slightly cruel, it’s doable. This year, however, on campus students are expected to move out of their dorms by the Sunday before Thanksgiving. It seems especially rude to expect students to study for exams while also packing up 12 weeks worth of stuff and hauling it across the country (WHY didn’t I listen to all of the emails telling me to “pack light.”) To make matters worse, some professors have chosen the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving to make exams/essays due. We just got home — let us breathe!!! Not only do we get to suddenly readjust to living with our parents for the next two months, but we also get to take an assessment on optimizing functions (everyone’s dream) — welcome home!
The Right-After-Thanksgiving Final
Okay, this one was brutal even before classes were virtual, but it’s only being made infinitely worse by not coming back to campus after Thanksgiving. Being back home for that glorious Thanksgiving-through-Christmas-blur time of year almost guarantees we won’t be studying for our post-Thanksgiving finals as much as we should be. We can almost hear the Mariah Carey blasting and see the twinkling Christmas lights draped around our hometowns’ trees already. Despite your professors’ best attempt to make this seem less bad than it really is by telling you to take a break over Thanksgiving and enjoy time with family, the only real way to prep for an exam in the first week of December is to (you guessed it) study over Thanksgiving break. Please don’t make us spend this beautiful time of year glued to our computer screens (My blue-light damaged eyes beg of you.) Get in the holiday spirit and ditch those horrible first-week-of December finals.
Finals were never our favorite part of Harvard, but hey, you didn’t end up here without having taken a test or two in your time. But the combination of Zoom fatigue and an early move-out for those on campus makes us even less inclined to study for said virtual exams. If any of your professors try to hit you with these especially evil virtual exams, make sure to unmute yourself on Zoom and tell them, “dude, that’s rude.”
