Raveena’s “Moonstone” EP is a four-track wonder that feels like a warm hug to those of us who have stayed up late at night wondering if we’re good enough for someone else. She released “Moonstone” Feb. 7, a week after the self-directed music video for the song “Headaches,” which features Raveena and YouTuber Hitomi Mochizuki co-starring as lovers in a romantic technicolor daydream. The EP blends psychedelic indie pop with soul, resulting in a genre-defying set of tracks where Raveena explores past relationships and her own identity. In the midst of the pain of love and loss, she manages to make something beautiful — paying homage to the moments that shaped her, no matter how fleeting they may have been.
The EP is a collection of songs that Raveena and producer Everett Orr made during the same recording session as her debut album, “Lucid.” Although the two projects are similar in sound, the dreamy production and Raveena’s airy but controlled vocals allow the EP to resist sounding repetitive or overdone. In a tweet, she described “Moonstone” as a “bittersweet goodbye” to youth and first loves, and the ethereal harmonies and bright guitar melodies throughout the four tracks certainly evoke the nostalgia of growing up.
“Headaches” expresses the different emotions entangled in the bliss of new love — the saccharine sweetness that makes you want to trust the other person completely, even though you know the danger that comes with vulnerability. The shimmery, arpeggiated chords that open the song carry the listener to the chorus with heavenly backing vocals that support her as she croons “Don’t play with my heart / I’m tryna be smart.” Two and a half minutes in, the song switches gears — the drums come in stronger and the track speeds up as Raveena surrenders herself to love. Her voice is buttery as she repeats “There’s no sunset without you” at the song’s end. Raveena’s honeyed vocals and the sudden switch in tempo create a powerful combination that conveys the all-consuming nature of falling in love, effortlessly pulling the listener into her bliss.
In “Close 2 U,” we see the other side of the newfound love described in “Headaches.” As Raveena pleads “Don’t leave so soon / Too close to you,” her gentle but insistent tone conveys the desperation she feels as she seeks to hold on to a relationship that is fading.
On “Heartbeat,” soft instrumentals contrast with thumping bass reminiscent of a club beat as she sings about “dancing under blue lights so slow.” The moment she captures with this song is tinged by sadness as she admits that it’s doomed to end once the night is over, but she embraces the ephemerality and insists that her partner pull her closer, at least until it's time to let go. The song ends with a triumphant, cinematic synth line that gives this track a refreshingly cheery feel compared to the first two songs. Although the song might seem more shallow than other tracks on the EP, with “Heartbeat,” Raveena gives space for carefree pleasure. For queer women of color, whose stories are so often not told at all or are ones of tragedy. Creating this space is essential.
The final track, “Starflower,” is a tender lullaby that is beautiful in its simplicity. The same poignant chord progression plays throughout the song as Raveena sings “Starflower has the weight of the world / Starflower sings just like the bluest bird.” The song is an ode to those who carry the weight of the world on their shoulders and an appeal for them to seek comfort in the celestial.
Each song is heart-wrenchingly gorgeous in its intimate writing and soothing instrumentation, a testament to Raveena’s ability to transport the listener into an other-wordly soundscape that foregrounds brown, queer love.

Great artists are great because they are innovative and take risks. They are willing to play with style and put their feet forward into the abyss of public opinion in order to change the norms of the music industry. The revolutionaries of the music world, however, come as both a blessing and a curse — some of their songs are just plain terrible. To appreciate the pioneers in the music world who made terrible songs without being labeled terrible artists, here are some obvious choices (and some hot takes) for the top five worst songs by great artists.
5. “Om” by John Coltrane 
Coltrane is a true legend and one of the most influential jazz musicians of all time. His music is exciting, soothing, beautiful, chaotic, and inspirational. He successfully used wordless jazz to convey messages as powerful as if he were reciting poetry. All that said, great musicians sometimes have minor disappointments. Coltrane’s “Om” is excruciatingly strange and difficult to listen to. It starts with ritualistic chanting and a whining, out of tune flute. If you’ve ever played a wind instrument, you’re familiar with the awful squeaking sound it makes when you blow too hard; the song mixes the shriek of instruments with a flute that sounds like it’s being played by a second grader. That cacophony is basically the majority of song, along with chaotic combinations of out-of-sync and off-key instruments. It’s nails-on-a-chalkboard cringey.
4. “Revolution 9“ by the Beatles
This is an obvious example of great artists taking a step forward in the wrong direction. The Beatles are often recognized for their experimental and pioneering rock style. They toyed around with sampling, multi-track recording, and many other musical techniques still used today. Their experimental style, however, didn’t always land them in the realm of artistic genius. First off, “Revolution 9” is eight minutes and 22 seconds long. John Lennon, Yoko Ono, and George Harrison created this melange of dysfunctional sound bites in 1968, and it includes sound effects, violins, a tape of someone saying “number nine” (the only lyrics in the song), and chunks of classical music. It was an attempt to appeal to the new avant-garde art world by experimenting with “musique concrete.” It certainly didn’t appeal to their fans, and needless to say, most just skipped over it on their otherwise successful “White Album”.
3. “Closed on Sunday” by Kanye West 
Kanye West is a controversial character, but he is an undeniably influential artist. His latest album, “JESUS IS KING,” has been a point of contention and disappointment for many Kanye fans, and the most puzzling song on his new album is “Closed on Sunday.” Kanye’s new devotion to creating music about Jesus and God can be thought of as admirable, but Christian devotion can’t salvage the lyrics of the song. West’s rhyming is truly cringeworthy, and because the song isn’t very long, it feels as if a lot of the two-and-a-half minutes are dedicated to “Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A / You’re my number one, with the lemonade.” The song then ends with a shrieked “CHICK-FIL-A!” Amen?
2.”FourFiveSeconds” by Rihanna, Kanye West, Paul McCartney
“FourFiveSeconds“ is probably not the first to come to mind when thinking of terrible songs but, considering the artists that created it, it is an obvious choice. When three multi-time Grammy winners come together to make a song, we expect nothing less than absolute genius. The song is not objectively bad, but it doesn’t live up to its artistic potential. The lyrics are meaningless and, at times, it sounds like someone is shrieking nonsense in the background. The whole song is about three minutes long and the chorus is repeated four times. This means that the majority of the song is the same five lines getting stuck in people’s heads, the songwriters clearly hoping to make the song an inescapable chart topper.
1. “Something Just Like This” by Coldplay and The Chainsmokers
Coldplay’s release “Something Just Like This” was a great disappointment. This may be a hot take, but it is an objectively generic, bad song, and not what one would expect from the creators of “The Scientist,” “Sparks,” or “Fix You.” Although it reached top ten rankings on multiple global charts, it is certainly not worthy of the honor. “Something Just Like This” is a regurgitated, clichéd, same-chords-as-every-other-pop-song, lame cycle of soft beginning, buildup, and a basic beat drop with Chris Martin’s voice softly “doodoodoo”ing in the background. If Coldplay wants to stay relevant they shouldn’t give into the allure of collaborating with The Chainsmokers and becoming background noise. Coldplay is selling out to try to appeal to the masses. Keep making sad acoustic music! It’s what you’re good at!

On Jan. 22, Hayley Williams — Paramore frontwoman and emo sweetheart — announced her forthcoming debut studio album would be released on May 8. Giving fans a taste of what’s to come, Williams released her solo EP, “Petals for Armor I,” on Feb. 8. A collection of five experimental songs, “Petals for Armor I” not only proves Williams’s individuality and talent as an artist outside of Paramore — a band she's been part of for 16 years — but also manifests a complex series of indescribable feelings that leave you wanting, no yearning, for more of her work.
“Petals for Armor I” opens with Williams’s debut solo single “Simmer”: four minutes and 26 seconds of breathy singing, carefully arranged instrumentals, thoughtful vocal layering, and compelling narrative lyrics. The track is haunting, but not in an anxiety-inducing way. Rather, “Simmer” leaves the listener curious, wanting to know what Williams thought and felt as she crafted the song. “Simmer” gives listeners something new to ponder with every note, lyric, and cadence. It is impossible to listen to “Simmer” just once and feel satisfied. It must be sat with in order to unpack every carefully crafted element from the opening vocal percussion and breathing to the bridge where Williams sings “Wrap yourself in petals / Wrap yourself in petals for armor.” The perfect opening track for “Petals for Armor I,” “Simmer” compels interest in where the EP will go next.
The following track, “Leave It Alone,” is immediately sonically different from the first. With the same thoughtfulness that went into crafting “Simmer,” Williams creates a new, but not dissimilar, feeling of curiosity and longing on “Leave it Alone.” The next song, “Cinnamon,” is a groovy tribute to home and the safety it provides. A driving bassline pushes the song forward as Williams sings about being both vulnerable and feminine. The bridge and breakdown of “Cinnamon,” where Williams sings “I am not lonely, I am free” over a funky bassline, is fun, danceable, and inspiring — Williams shows that being alone is not always a bad thing. “Creepin’,” the fourth track on the EP, takes listeners on a trip as it transitions between softly sung, mystical verses to the heavy-hitting chorus. Despite its spooky lyrics and eerie mood, “Creepin’” is an upbeat, head-bobbing tune that fits perfectly in the context of the collective work.
The next and final song off “Petals for Armor I,” “Sudden Desire,” exemplifies intense yearning. With the opening lyrics, “I wanted him to kiss me how / With open mouth and open mouth / We keep our distance now / I wanna feel his hands go down,” sung over soft, rhythmic guitar chords and minimal percussion, Williams embodies what it means to want someone you cannot have. After the lyrics “Too far to go back now / Just wanna feel his hands go down” — with “down” punctuated by a pause in the instrumentals and a drop in the bass — the dynamics of the song shift completely for the chorus. Almost robotic, Williams repeats the phrase “sudden, sudden desire” over bass-driven instrumentals before belting out “sudden desire” and bringing the song back to the same style with which it began. The shifts and transitions in “Sudden Desire” are drastic, thoughtfully designed, and different from one another, reminiscent of the drama and dynamism of a concerto.
Williams demonstrates the undoubtable talent that fans of Paramore have come to expect from her while also straying so far away from the band’s style and asserting her individuality as an artist so skillfully that listeners of her EP will not immediately associate her with her past works. “Petals for Armor I” is the perfect work to begin a solo career after spending so much time as part of a well-established group. Each track on the EP may be different from the last, but they all work together to create an indescribable mood somewhere at the intersection of calm nostalgia and particular intimacy. “Petals for Armor I” is the type of music that you put on loop without caring that you have been listening to the same 18 minutes of music repeat for hours on end because it is just that good. Tune out and feel the calmness of the music wrap you in a hug or indulge in it — listen to each lyric and backing element of the songs and let yourself feel it.

Looking for a quick read with a few charmingly disturbing twists? “Obscura,” a Gothic graphic novel born from a collaboration between writer Luke Cartwright and artist Lukasz Wnuczek, might be just the thing. Set in Van Diemen’s Land in the late 19th century, Cartwright and Wnuczek’s story follows an isolated man named William Morier whose father — the local undertaker — was ripped away from him in his youth and imprisoned for selling corpses to medical practitioners. When William stumbles upon Catherine White, a self-professed medium whom he’d known peripherally during childhood, he’s swept up in a whirlwind romance that comes to a sudden standstill upon receiving news of Catherine’s ectopic pregnancy. To raise money for the surgical procedure that would terminate the pregnancy to save Catherine’s life, the couple stages pictures of “spirits” using old photographic plates that still carry images of the Morier funeral home’s former patrons and tries to sell them to sentimental family members of the departed.
The pacing of “Obscura” is at times choppy and rushed, which is particularly obvious in the opening scenes when Cartwright and Wnuczek overturn a deluge of information on the reader in the space of only a few pages. After a few panels’ worth of expository dialogue establishing William’s family background, the setting abruptly shifts to the funeral home where William’s father is busy applying makeup to a cadaver, where it remains for less than three full pages before the authors cut again to a paranormal incident at Catherine White’s residence. Though the initial frequency of jumps in time and space can be explained by the fact that “Obscura” begins in medias res and must establish its cast of characters and the scope of its fictional world, it is nonetheless a clumsy, unengaging manner of introducing a story.
Another shortcoming of “Obscura” is its initial over-reliance on horror genre tropes, both verbal and visual, which causes it to come across as trying too hard to evoke fear in its readers. The early exposition features exaggerated, theatrical language that is more campy than terrifying: “The spectre of William Morier looms over Van Diemen’s Land like a sunset shadow, shifting and stretching and beckoning the darkness.” Similarly, the artwork in the first act of the plot also lacks subtlety in its attempts to induce a few shivers. For instance, a scene of William sitting in the mortuary late at night and talking aloud to corpses plays out across three consecutive panels where a shadowed figure gradually approaches from behind and claps a hand on William’s unsuspecting shoulder. It’s a classic jump scare sequence, but the element of surprise that grants it such effectiveness in horror films is lost in translation when adapted to the form of a graphic novel.
Nonetheless, once “Obscura” settles into its own rhythm and stops actively trying to horrify, it manages to create an atmospheric sense of eeriness that registers on a subconscious level. In fact, “Obscura” is most effective when it abandons dialogue altogether and takes full advantage of its visual elements to either silently magnify moments of tension across multi-page spreads, or surrealistically depict William’s increasingly troubled mental state. Wnuczek accomplishes both of the above in a riveting scene where William shoots an unsuspecting man with a gun hidden beneath the dark cloth over his camera and immediately sinks into a moral crisis, represented by a close-up of William’s eyes superimposed over a motley of savior figures like Jesus Christ and angels and ominous characters such as the Grim Reaper.
Certainly, the gradual introduction of mental instability and the transformation of William into an unreliable narrator is one of the greatest strengths in “Obscura.” The very presence of impending insanity helps ground the plot’s abundant supernatural motifs in a subtler kind of horror that is disturbing for its personal rawness. Beyond generating doubt regarding William’s sanity, Cartwright and Wnuczek cleverly create an additional layer of ambiguity by framing the events of the graphic novel as a submission to a pulp fiction magazine called “The Illustrated Crime Chronicle,” leaving the reader to question whether the entire work of “Obscura” is merely a tongue-in-cheek, meta representation of madness all along.
Despite its rocky beginning, “Obscura” is ultimately a worthwhile read for Gothic horror fans who enjoy a slow-burning, atmospheric eeriness.

“How ‘bout that debate last night? Pretty crazy, huh?”
Last week, the Las Vegas debate outperformed both the Grammys and the Golden Globes, becoming the most-watched Democratic primary debate ever. But I doubt that nearly 20 million people tuned in because they thought listening to Elizabeth Warren explain her universal child care plan would be more intellectually stimulating than an Ariana Grande performance. People got exactly what they came to see: some damn good entertainment.
Take a look at the headlines after the debate: “Elizabeth Warren came out swinging, and Mike Bloomberg was left battered” and “Elizabeth Warren Roasts Mike Bloomberg in Rowdy Las Vegas Debate.” Clearly the Las Vegas setting was apt for the show; if you change the names in the articles it might sound like a recap of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather. Now, many of these articles seem to be using sports language facetiously, but it's not an unreasonable way to describe the debate. NBC, the airing network, clearly wanted to evoke a sporting event; many of the questions were designed to conjure heated one-on-one matchups. Even the debate’s introduction looked like something they would air before Sunday Night Football.
The way many of us follow politics mirrors the way we follow sports. It's entertaining, even a little fun — cracking jokes about the opposition, laughing with your fellow supporters, diving into the details and statistics.
There’s an emptiness to much of our political culture — a hobby masquerading as civic engagement. Opinion pieces, cable news, podcasts, debates, what is the point? It’s easy to have a bad relationship with politics. With so much information available, we can arm ourselves with an encyclopedia of useless political knowledge that is almost never applied to anything meaningful. As Tufts political science professor Eitan Hersh said, “What they're actually doing is not participating themselves in any active way. They're really just following the news.”
Political knowledge can often be nothing more than cocktail party fodder — a way to signal your sophistication and intellect. Dinner table punditry might make you look good; after all, knowing the demographic makeup of Ohio is sure to turn a few heads. But if impressing our friends is the culmination of our efforts, then we end up looking a bit silly.
Many people do, however, go beyond the cocktail party and act in the real world, but not because they can predict how Ohio will vote. They might not know the details of how Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg differ on gun control, but they fought for a park in their town. They might not know who represents Florida’s fifth congressional district, but they volunteer at the homeless shelter. We need to do more to commend these people for the impact they have.
But I’m not talking about these people; I’m talking about the large portion that are hyper-invested and at the same time do so little. There’s a subset of people — well-educated, probably liberal — whose knowledge goes far beyond being well informed into the unnecessary (you will find many right here on this campus).
Now, I could have written this piece as a call to action. We certainly need more civic activity in local and state politics, and it would surely help the country depolarize, but I’m not convinced that being politically attentive necessarily makes one more likely to act. Reading about politics on the internet is a lot easier than going out and accomplishing something tangible, so we cannot assume that the political junkie is one step away from civic action.
I’m not asking people to jump into local politics. Instead, I propose that some of us dial back the obsession with politics — to really reconsider the urge to consume so much politics.
In 2018 the New York Times published “The Man Who Knew Too Little,” an article about Erik Hagerman, who in the aftermath of the 2016 election, “swore that he would avoid learning about anything that happened to America after Nov. 8, 2016,” and secluded himself in the woods to restore the land. He was met with strong criticism as people considered his vow to be another perk of rich white male privilege — he didn’t have to pay attention because he wasn’t under threat. However, Vox co-founder Ezra Klein notes, “Were those of us sending angry missives into the ether really doing more than this guy who was restoring land to gift back to his neighbors?”
Now, I’m not advocating for sticking our heads in the sand. People obviously play a crucial role in representative democracy; if everyone acted like Hagerman, the government could run amok. In fact, I would still argue that far too many people in this country are under-informed and under-engaged. A poll showed that almost 40 percent of Americans asked could not even name one right protected by the First Amendment.
But we must keep in mind that political hobbyism is not civic virtue. Our country needs a well-informed electorate, but it’s a representative democracy; we don’t all need to roleplay as senators with an important vote in the morning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I am a sexual assault survivor. I am the one in five women who will be sexually assaulted during college, according to the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. I am also a part of the 90 percent of sexual assault victims on college campuses who do not report the assault. But, it may not be for the reason you think.
Although a bit outdated now, this 2007 report by the National Institute of Justice found that the three main reasons students do not report sexual assault are: (1) they did not think it was serious enough to report, (2) it was unclear that a crime was committed or that harm was intended, (3) they did not want anyone to know about the incident.
Yet, my decision to refrain from reporting was not because of any of those listed by the NIJ. Instead, I was afraid of hostile treatment towards my perpetrator. There is no handbook on how to process trauma like sexual assault — for the victim or for those around them. That is precisely what makes the publicity of reporting such a daunting task: the unpredictability it necessarily invokes in how anyone, including the survivor, responds.
Perhaps surprisingly, more so than the fear of judgment of myself as a survivor, I was afraid of the judgment it would provoke of my perpetrator. He had been a close friend for years — a relationship that was not without its own trials and tribulations, but still one of the closest ones I had ever forged. The guilt he showed in our discussions of the incident was palpable, his remorse undeniable. He apologized profusely and sincerely, and took actionable steps to ensure he never mistreated another human being again.
To me, the victim of his actions, that is all that mattered. I decided for myself that it was my prerogative as the aggrieved party to delineate when justice had been served on my behalf. While his actions satisfied my demand for justice, I must confess that a fear of “cancel culture” also contributed to my ultimate decision to not report.
I was afraid of the unforgiving and seemingly arbitrary “cancel culture” that often accompanies reports of sexual assault — the public cries to “cancel” someone that commonly appends these incidents in pop culture movements like #MeToo. It represented a response that I, the victim in the incident, could not control even though my wellbeing should be the foremost priority.
Last week, I heard Tarana Burke, the founder of #MeToo, speak at The Cambridge Union. As she recalled the journey of the movement and the tremendous role it has served in supporting survivors, she also mentioned that it was not the responsibility of the organization to account for individuals who may distort the message of the #MeToo Movement into one that advocates for “cancel culture.”
Merriam-Webster defines cancel culture as the removal “of support for public figures in response to their objectionable behavior or opinions. This can include boycotts or refusal to promote their work.” Yet, even though the #MeToo movement founder criticized aspects of the #MeToo movement’s that latch onto juicy details and seek harsh punishments on all perpetrators, Merriam-Webster attributes, at least partially, the pervasiveness of “cancel culture” — which often prompts exactly that kind of lashing out publicly and with incomplete information — to #MeToo.
Indeed, the #MeToo movement and its founder have made accountability for sexual assault more accessible by tapping into technology, like social media and digital news. But, I do not believe that the movement can take credit for those positive outcomes without also recognizing its contribution to the popularization of arbitrary cancel culture. The online #MeToo phenomenon must also take responsibility for often doling out punishments and consequences that the survivors themselves may not have even wanted. As a movement that prides itself on prioritizing sexual assault survivors, it has to reconcile this messaging with the contingent of advocates who often adjudicate without consulting first.
However, I do understand how a sexual assault incident is not only an attack against that individual, but it is also an attack against the core values of a society and its state. That is why criminal court cases are prosecuted by the state, by the society that has been afflicted by an individual’s actions. But, that is also why we must separate the court of law from the court of public opinion — and while pursuing a criminal route through the court of law is often the decision of the survivor, how the court of public opinion proceeds once granted the information is rarely in their control.
Individuals in any society deserve to have information that enables them to protect themselves. That is why we have a mechanisms like the sex offenders registry. However, those kinds of public goods often require the survivor to self-report, and if we as a society do not demonstrate how the victim’s desires are our priority in the court of public opinion, then we kneecap ourselves in the court of law moving forward.

Earlier this month, the United States Department of Education opened an investigation into Harvard’s foreign funding, requesting information on gifts and contracts connected to various foreign governments, including China and Iran, as well as from a number of foreign companies. Harvard is not alone in receiving this scrutiny; Yale, Georgetown University, Cornell University, and MIT are all part of the government’s larger campaign to crack down on "academic espionage."
Harvard has been roiled with funding scandals this year, from the arrest of Chemistry Department Chair Charles M. Lieber for lying about Chinese funding sources to the exposure of the University’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein. These situations raise deep concerns about the ethics and intentions of the people that fund our institution and are given access to it. In light of these recent events, we agree with the premise of the Department of Justice’s probe: that Harvard’s system to evaluate its funding sources is imperfect, and is in need of improvement.
However, Harvard’s relationship with the Department of Education must be understood in the context of the Department’s broader backlash against institutions of higher learning. In her 2017 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, current Secretary of Education Betsy D. DeVos made a point of specifying that “the fight against the educational establishment” she has committed her Department to extends to colleges and universities. DeVos went on to condemn institutions of higher learning broadly, which she characterized as places where “the faculty, from adjunct professors to deans, tell you what to do, what to say, and more ominously, what to think.” The Trump administration has also already targeted Chinese students at elite institutions of higher education, restricting student visas as part of a broad package of trade restrictions targeting Beijing. Because of developments such as this, we are cautious of fully embracing the Department of Education’s inquiry, though we think the specific concern raised is valid in nature.
The key issue regarding accepting financial contributions must be its impact on the academic work of our institution. Harvard should be open to accepting contributions from foreign governments so long as these contributions improve the quality of our institution. We do not believe that the foreignness of a funding source, in and of itself, should lead us to exclude donations. If Harvard receives money from a foreign government to study specific legitimate academic inquiries, we should welcome the contributions for the knowledge or good they will help produce.
However, if the foreign government in question contributes in the hopes of propagating some self-serving political counter-narrative, or does so for some other overtly political purpose by leveraging Harvard’s credibility, then the donation becomes problematic. Contributions for the purpose of whitewashing misdeeds and exerting influence must obviously be avoided.
In short, intention is key. Harvard must keep its contributions clean to facilitate its ability to do rigorous academic work. But ruling out donations simply because they come from another country runs deeply counter to the international, open spirit we believe the University should champion.

Sixteen students were elected to the Undergraduate Council in the recent midterm elections, according to UC election commission chair Perry M. Arrasmith ’20.
Thirty-seven students ran for 16 open seats on the Council. Five candidates ultimately withdrew from the race.
One of those who withdrew was Dhilan Ramaprasad ’21, who earned the highest amount of votes in the election for Mather House — despite the fact that he didn’t plan to run in the first place. Ramaprasad wrote in an email that he ended up on the ballot because his friends submitted his name for the Council midterm elections.
Ramaprasad wished the new Mather UC reps, Zachary A. Zimmer ’22 and Jinyuan “Ryan” Zhang ’21, a successful semester.
“They’re great people, and I know they’ll do good work,” Ramaprasad wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Two write-in candidates won seats on the Council — Maximilian “Max” J. Wang ’20 of Pforzheimer House and Shlomo T. Zach Cahlon ’21 of Winthrop House.
The voting period for the election lasted from Tuesday at noon and concluded Friday at noon.
More students voted in the midterm election this year than in previous years, with a total of 736 votes cast this year. In comparison, just 154 students voted in the UC midterm elections last year, and 371 students voted in 2018.
Voter turnout was highest in Quincy House with 142 voters, followed by Elm Yard with 123. Winthrop House had the fewest students voting, with only 29 votes cast in the election.
The Council held its first meeting with its new representatives on Sunday.
The newly elected representatives for the Undergraduate Council are as follows:
Adams House
Ilan M. Goldberg ’20
Cabot House

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A week after a protest of the Harvard University Police Department, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said in a Feb. 18 interview that police presence at campus events is intended to ensure protesters’ safety.
Khurana said he believes activism is an important part of “democratic life” on campus and that Harvard police’s responsibility is to ensure “safe” and “peaceful” protests.
“The role of police and campus authorities from my observation point has been essentially be there to protect the community and to protect the protesters just as much as it is also to ensure just non-disruption of everyday activities of the institution,” he said.
He also cited the Department’s focus on implementing “community policing” by engaging Harvard affiliates in their work.
“That philosophy depends on healthy relationships between the police force and the community that is protecting,” Khurana said. “Each of us plays a role in building those healthy relationships. And I think it's particularly important to ensure that there's lots of communication going back and forth in those areas.”
HUPD has come under fire this semester for its allegedly discriminatory conduct and culture after The Crimson published an investigation that identified patterns of racism and sexism in the police force spanning nearly three decades. In lawsuits, discrimination complaints, and interviews, current and former officers said the department’s culture is replete with alleged favoritism and retaliation.
Earlier this month, the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition organized a rally calling for the resignation of Harvard University Police Department Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley.
At the rally, protesters cited alleged harassment they have experienced in their interactions with Harvard police officers and called for Riley’s removal. Some held signs that read “Abolish HUPD, End Discrimination,” “White Supremacy Kills. We Will Defend Ourselves,” and “Policing is Violent.”
Protesters accused HUPD and the Cambridge Police Department of discriminating against students of color and claimed that both departments have increased their presence on campus to monitor student activists. They said they have observed an increase in plainclothes HUPD officers monitoring events — particularly those organized by students of color — and noticed CPD officers being “called in at alarming rates.”
After the protest, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that the department treats all University affiliates equally.
“The Harvard University Police Department is committed to providing a safe and secure campus through quality policing and treats all persons with dignity and respect,” he wrote.
In November, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay commissioned a report to investigate an Oct. 24 interaction between Harvard police and students of color attempting to install a class art exhibition in the Harvard Yard. During the incident, a HUPD officer questioned the students and asked to see their IDs. The report ultimately concluded that the officer did not act with “malicious intent.”
Khurana said he both supports HUPD’s presence at rallies and students’ right to protest.
“Diverse perspectives and points of view are critical,” he said. “And my role as Dean is to ensure that we keep a space that allows for those diverse perspectives and points of view.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council discussed funding options for student organizations under executive session — a private, off-the-record session of the Council, whose meetings are normally open to the public — at Sunday’s meeting.
Eliot House representative and UC Finance Committee Chair Rukmini “Mini” Ganesh ’22 motioned for the Council to be brought into executive session — where only UC representatives are allowed — twice; once in order to deliver routine committee updates, and again to discuss legislation for funding for student organizations.
According to the meeting’s agenda, during the executive session, the UC discussed a Finance Committee-sponsored act in response to the committee not having enough money in its checking account to cover this semester’s grants. The act would allocate $21,000 from the Burst Pack, which is for discretionary spending purposes, to the Finance Committee.
This would allow the committee access to additional funds for student organizations’ semester grants.
After the meeting, Currier House representative Jack M. Swanson ’22 expressed confusion over why the Council needed to go into executive session twice.
“There is nothing we're going to discuss that should be fully confidential,” Swanson said.
The meeting also established more ties to the campus’s theatre community, unanimously passing a block grant of $9,000 to the Harvard Radcliffe Dramatics Club. The grant, which would be used for productions put on by the HRDC, would come out of the Council’s Burst Pack, which is budgeted at more than $49,000.
Ganesh clarified her reasons for the proposal.
“We normally fund theater out of the Finance Committee, but what we’re trying to do here is to have an expressed line item in our budget for theater like we do for PHBA,” Ganesh said.
The UC also unanimously voted to restructure its Finance Committee. Ganesh and Kirkland House representative Carter H. Nakamoto ’21 co-sponsored the legislation.
Previously, the vice chair and secretary position of the Finance Committee were two separate positions but were functionally treated as a single position. With this new amendment to the bylaws of the Council, the vice chair and secretary were merged into a single position.
“It’s a one person job,” Ganesh said.
The Council also unanimously approved an act to publicize the College X Change program — which UC treasurer Noah Harris ’22 described as “Ebay for students” — to Harvard undergraduates.
The UC continued to promote outreach between the Council and the students through funding caucus events. Last week, the UC unanimously approved legislation that expanded the power of the caucus system.
At Sunday’s meeting, the body also voted to allocate $300 for a “Meet the International Caucus” event and another $300 for a “Meet the Asian American Caucus” event.
Sunday’s meeting was also the first for newly elected representatives, who won seats in last week’s midterm elections.
Elm Yard representative Emilio J. De Leon ’23 expressed excitement over his first meeting.
“I feel like as a representative, I'd be able to really contribute input, and it will be directly heard by the executive board,” De Leon said. “So as you can tell, it was a pretty productive climate, and a lot got done in the two hours that I was here. I really enjoyed it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Panelists at a Harvard Kennedy School event Friday urged the U.S. government to pay reparations to the descendants of slaves, calling it a moral responsibility.
Harvard Law School Professor Randall L. Kennedy and Cornell W. Brooks, the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, spoke to a crowd of roughly 100 at the event.
The talk touched on the viability of reparations and the form they could take.
Brooks referenced past instances of the United States making amends for harms inflicted on marginalized groups, noting that the idea of reparations is not novel.
“We talk about reparations historically speaking, as a standalone, something that is unique as though we don’t have precedent in American history,” Brooks said. “Japanese Americans who were compensated to the tune of $20,000 form a piece of our history where Americans have come to grips with an ugly past and made some kind of attempt of repairing and restoring and making whole.”
Multiple 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have brought the issue into the spotlight by recently coming out in support of exploring the feasibility of reparations. But Kennedy noted that even mentioning the term ‘reparations’ provokes a “visceral” reaction from many voters.
“There are a good many people in the United States, who when they hear the word reparations, they’re against it,” Kennedy said. “If you ask them, you know, “What is it?”, they might not even be able to tell you what it is.”
“This very term triggers a visceral reaction, negative reaction,” he said. “Not thousands, not hundreds of thousands, but millions of people.”
Friday’s panel — moderated by David J. Harris, director of a racial justice initiative at Harvard Law School — was the Institute of Politics’ third installation in honor of Black History Month. The IOP’s slate of February events seek to examine the influence of black political movements on students and faculty.
Mari Jones ’21, president of the IOP, said she was delighted that Friday’s event had finally “come to fruition.”
“I think the overall event was impactful and insightful and that everything that the speakers said carried a lot of weight and inspired a lot of thoughts,” Jones said.
In response to a question about how biracial individuals should factor into the conversation about reparations, Brooks acknowledged such questions are “hotly debated.”
“With respect to who are the legitimate moral claimants to reparations, I think that should be understood broadly, it should be understood historically, it should not be reduced to the degree of the color one has or does not, or hair texture,” Brooks said. “In other words, we don't need to, in the name of reparatory justice, replicate the very thing that has put us in a place where we are today.”
Brooks sought to frame the debate around reparations in terms of the country’s obligation to African Americans, rather than feeding into a narrative of “white guilt” that he called “debilitating,” eliciting applause and shouts of approval from the audience.
“The ways in which we have been robbed are tangible, measurable, quantifiable and ultimately immoral,” he said. “I like the word [responsibility] ’cause it implies action, commitment.”

A team of Harvard scientists will collaborate with a Chinese research institute in a five-year effort to study the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 78,000 people worldwide, according to a University press release Monday.
Co-led by Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley and Zhong Nanshan — the head of an expert team within China’s National Health Commission that is investigating the outbreak — the partnership will focus on creating more accurate diagnostic tests and designing vaccines, antiviral therapies, and treatments. Members of the group have held two video chats since its formation to begin the partnership, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
According to the press release, Daley said that the Medical School is “uniquely positioned” to bring together experts in virology, infectious diseases, structural biology, pathology, vaccine development, epidemiology, and public health for the project.
“Harnessing our science to tackle global health challenges is at the very heart of our mission as an institution dedicated to improving human health and well-being worldwide,” he said in the release.
The two research partners will share $115 million in funding from China Evergrande Group, a real estate giant and Fortune Global 500 company.
Zhong gained international recognition for his work combatting the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. He was also the first scientist to publicly confirm human-to-human transmissibility during 2019’s n-Cov epidemic.
“We are extremely encouraged by the generous gesture from Evergrande to coordinate and support the collaboration and by the overwhelmingly positive response from our Harvard colleagues,” Zhong said in the press release.
“We look forward to leveraging each of our respective strengths to address the immediate and longer-term challenges and a fruitful collaboration to advance the global well-being of all people,” he added.
Hui Ka Yan, who chairs China Evergrande Group, said in the press release that the company is “honored” to work to stop the outbreak. The group’s CEO, Xia Haijun, visited University President Lawrence S. Bacow in Cambridge last Wednesday, according to a statement from the company.
“Evergrande is honored to have the opportunity to contribute to the fight against this global public health threat,” Hui Ka Yan said in Harvard’s press release. “We thank all the scientists who responded so swiftly and enthusiastically from the Harvard community and are deeply moved by Harvard and Dr. Zhong’s team’s dedication and commitment to this humanitarian cause. We have the utmost confidence in this global collaborative team to reach impactful discoveries against the outbreak soon.”
Bacow said in the release that the collaborators are “confident” that their work will “contribute valuable discoveries” to broader global efforts to combat coronavirus.
“We are grateful for Evergrande’s leadership and generosity in facilitating this collaboration and for all the scientists and clinicians rising to the call of action in combating this emerging threat to global well-being,” he said.
Harvard affiliates participating in the effort include Daley; Medical School Dean for Research Operations and Global Programs David E. Golan; Immunology department chair Arlene H. Sharpe; Medicine professor Bruce D. Walker; Harvard School of Public Health Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics director Marc Lipsitch; and Lindsey R. Baden, the director of clinical research in Brigham and Women’s Hospital’s Division of Infectious Diseases.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A panel of speakers discussed the role and limits of free speech on college campuses at the inaugural Harvard Law School Rappaport Forum on Friday.
In a discussion lasting roughly an hour on Friday afternoon, Lisa Feldman Barrett, a psychology professor at Northeastern University, and Jonathan Haidt, an ethical leadership professor at New York University, discussed the definition of violent speech and how the parameters of free speech have changed on college campuses with the advent of the internet.
The Law School launched the Rappaport Forum to promote discussion on current affairs. The Phyllis & Jerome Lyle Rappaport Foundation funded the series to honor Jerry L. Rappaport ’47, who founded the HLS Forum in 1946 to invite speakers to address issues facing the world post-World War II.
“In a society that is badly divided, this forum was served as a reminder of how important it is, and how much can be learned from the respectful clash of ideas,” Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 said at the beginning of the event.
Haidt has previously commented extensively on the role of free speech on college campuses. In 2018, he co-wrote “The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure,” arguing against trigger warnings and safe spaces.
At the Law School event, Haidt drew a distinction between the idea of free speech in public spaces and the idea of free speech on college campuses. He argued universities should follow a different set of parameters regarding free speech than other public spaces.
“You can’t just come here and say, you know, the Newtown shootings never happened,” Haidt said. “There’s no point in having that on a college campus. And so I think we all agree that a scholar who had presented work that some people find horrible, hateful, or upsetting if still playing by the rules and should be allowed — is a legitimate person to invite.”
Barrett said educators should be mindful of students’ backgrounds and their tolerance for stress when engaging in difficult topics and conversation.
“The truth is honestly that some of us are better equipped just because of our life circumstances to deal with than others,” she said. “It doesn't mean that they are off the hook for any responsibility, but he does mean that there's a context here. And we do well as educators to pay attention to that context where we won't actually meet the goal that we have.”
She added that she believes campus speech policies should have a basis in science.
“We have evolved as a species to have socially dependent nervous systems,” Barrett said. “That means I can text three words to someone halfway around the world, who can't hear my voice and can't see my face, and I can make their heart rate go up.”
“If we all do that — which we do — we regulate each other's nervous systems, that means we are more responsible actually, for people, then we might like,” she added.
Law School student Nathan Wexler said he thought both speakers’ discussion on the parameters of speaker invitations at colleges was productive, adding that he believes universities should have a “clear set of morals about what should be allowed and what shouldn’t be.”
Rappaport said in an interview with The Crimson that he hopes both Friday’s event and future forums will engage with “important and frequently divisive public policy issues with opposing sides.”
“It's in some ways a kind of return to a period of time when you have some bipartisan solutions to problems,” he said. “The middle area is a very lonely place at the present time, so I hope that the dean’s program keeps focusing on issues that are extraordinarily important to the Continental world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Of the seven Massachusetts politicians who have run for president since 1960, none have lost their home state in the primary.
For U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the pressure is on to continue that trend.
Thirty-three percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention are up for grabs next Tuesday — the largest haul of any single day to date. In Massachusetts, 91 pledged delegates are up for grabs — the fifth most of the any of the 14 Super Tuesday states.
Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor who has served in the Senate since 2012, has finished below 15 percent — the threshold to receive a delegate — in two of the three states that have voted. After receiving a bump in national polling following a strong debate performance last week, the Warren campaign is counting on Super Tuesday to rebound.
Super Tuesday will also serve as an important test for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who struggled in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, while providing an opportunity for former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Peter P.M. Buttigieg ’04.
For the past several weeks, billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg has loomed large over the Democratic race as he has spent large sums of money and campaigned across the country — but has not appeared on the ballot in the states that have voted. Super Tuesday will serve as Bloomberg’s effective debut.
Warren has been mobilizing her campaign infrastructure in Massachusetts ahead of Super Tuesday, when Bay State voters will go to the polls along with 13 other states.
“We feel like Senator Warren has had the most touchpoints with Massachusetts residents,” State Representative Andres X. Vargas said. “Being the senator from here, folks have been able to get to know here better than anybody else.”
Warren holds a number of high-profile Massachusetts endorsements, including state Attorney General Maura T. Healey ’92. U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, who is running in a closely-watched primary for Massachusetts’ other Senate seat, is holding an early voting kick-off event for Warren supporters in Cambridge Tuesday.
Vargas said that any endorsement bump Warren receives in Massachusetts is likely to come from the organizing ability of her surrogates.
“If you don’t have folks to actually go out there and spread the message, spread the word, and show how well-organized the campaign is, then endorsements don’t matter as much,” Vargas said. “All the folks that have endorsed the senator are coming with their campaign infrastructure and are coming with their volunteers and are coming with the passion that is needed to make sure the senator wins Massachusetts.”
Scott Ferson, a Democratic strategist who worked for the late U.S. Senator Edward M. “Ted” Kennedy ’54 (D-Mass.), said that Warren has the most robust campaign infrastructure of any presidential candidate in Massachusetts.
“There’s a very, very strong built-in infrastructure for Elizabeth Warren that existed for her first Senate race in 2012,” Ferson said.
U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — Warren’s primary competitor on the progressive flank of the Democratic party — came within 2 percent of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Massachusetts presidential primary four years ago.
Sanders, who has represented neighboring Vermont in Washington since 1990, has full-time staff in Massachusetts. His campaign has been ramping up its ground game in the state since the New Hampshire primary by hosting events and recruiting organizers.
“It’s a real distributed model of local captains bringing people together in their own neighborhood,” Cambridge State Representative Mike Connolly, a Sanders supporter, said.
Connolly attended a canvass kick-off event at Harvard’s Dudley Co-op Saturday where roughly 10 volunteers turned out to knock on doors.
Jason B. Kleban ’11, a Sanders volunteer who trained canvassers before they went door-knocking Saturday, said the campaign focuses on encouraging casual supporters to become more involved and volunteer.
“We’ve got a real grassroots movement here,” Kleban said. “The strategy is really just to activate as many people as possible to plug into the campaign, and not just commit to vote but to volunteer as well.”
Bennett “Ben” Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, two longtime Sanders supporters who founded the popular Vermont ice cream company Ben & Jerry’s, held several events for Sanders over the weekend in Massachusetts. Climate change activist Varshini Prakash, a Boston native who co-founded the Sunrise Movement, also stumped for Sanders over the weekend.
Sanders blew away the Democratic field in the Nevada caucuses over the weekend, receiving support from 47 percent of caucusgoers.
Biden finished in a distant second place in Nevada.
Biden is relying on several high-profile endorsements from Massachusetts politicians, as well as support from five of the state’s labor unions to build his profile in the Bay State.
The former vice president has the backing of former Secretary of State John Kerry, who represented Massachustts in the Senate from 1985 until 2013, as well as U.S. Rep. Seth W. Moulton ’01 (D-Mass.) and U.S. Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.).
“Collectively, we’ve got support throughout the Commonwealth,” State Representative Brian M. Ashe, a Biden supporter, said. “I’m hopeful if people are watching and paying attention that they know Joe Biden’s the right choice.”
Biden’s path to the nomination has been complicated by the late entrance of Michael R. Bloomberg to the race. Bloomberg, a conservative Democrat who served as the mayor of New York for three terms, is out-spending his Demoratic rivals by a country mile.
He has poured a staggering sum — more than $450 million — into his campaign so far.
Bloomberg has focused his spending on Super Tuesday states in particular, where he has dropped $124 million on advertising alone. He has also centered on internet advertising and has spent nearly $42 million on Facebook ads.
Ashe said he does not think Bloomberg presents a threat to Biden in Massachusetts, but cautioned that Democrats nationwide should take him seriously.
“In Massachusetts, I don’t think it’ll have much of an impact,” he said. “I think Biden’s going to do very well here and I don’t think Mike Bloomberg’s going to take away from that here in the Commonwealth.”
“However, obviously [Bloomberg’s] a big presence,” he added. “When you have that kind of money and that kind of personality, people are going to take notice.”
Bloomberg came under fire from Democratic rivals at last Tuesday’s debate for his reported treatment of female employees, as well as for stop-and-frisk policing policies he enacted in New York that disproportionately affected African Americans.
He has built a large campaign infrastructure in Massachusetts, now boasting six campaign offices and 60 full-time staff members in the state.
“The biggest thing that we’re working on is connecting folks with a candidate who hopped in 13 weeks ago,” Bloomberg’s Massachusetts state director, Jordan Overstreet, said in an interview with The Crimson Sunday. “People see his TV ads, but I think it’s been very helpful that they’re also seeing people at their doors, too.”
Bloomberg’s campaign held several events with surrogates around Massachusetts over the weekend. Academy Award-winning actor Michael Douglas and former Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis III, who serves as the campaign’s state chair, stumped for Bloomberg in Lowell, Mass.
Will Keyser, a longtime Massachusetts political operative who worked for Ted Kennedy and later as a strategist on Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79’s Republican gubernatorial campaigns, serves as a senior advisor to Bloomberg’s Massachusetts operation.
Overstreet said the campaign plans to highlight Bloomberg’s childhood growing up in Medford, Mass., to show that he is “the epitome of the American success story.”
Senator Amy Klobuchar’s (D-Minn.) daughter, Abigail Bessler, made a campaign stop in Harvard Square Sunday afternoon to speak at a canvass kickoff. Several Harvard students attended and knocked on doors for Klobuchar.
Buttigieg has also been working to grow his presence in Massachusetts. The former president of the Harvard Institute of Politics Student Advisory Council named three state co-chairs last week.
“He’s making sure that the strategy is focused on delegate pickup, which means no part of any Super Tuesday state is being left behind,” Maria D. Robinson, one of the state co-chairs, said.
Buttigieg, a former Crimson columnist, had strong showings in both Iowa and New Hampshire. He finished in a distant third place in Saturday’s Nevada caucuses.
“If you saw in Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign went everywhere,” Robinson said. “It wasn’t just focused on getting a certain subset of voters. Part of Pete’s appeal overall is to get urban, rural, suburban voters, [and] all sorts of ages.”
Robinson stressed that Buttigieg is battle-tested and said he can unify the party.
“Michael Bloomberg can do really well in paid advertising, but when you actually put him up there against people who have been tested through the debate process, he’s not able to keep up with everyone who has gone through the fire,” Robinson said. “These folks, including Pete, have been campaigning for a year.”
Ferson said he expects the final week of campaigning to play a key role in determining the outcome in Massachusetts.
“It’s very much unsettled,” Ferson said of the race.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dropping banners during events and marching through Harvard Yard, multiple student activist organizations held demonstrations throughout Junior Family Weekend, advocating for causes from a contract for Harvard’s graduate student union to the establishment of a formalized ethnic studies program.
On Friday, dozens of students interrupted University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s welcoming remarks to families at Sanders Theatre, per a video posted to the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies’s Facebook page.
Protestors stood in front of the stage and hoisted banners that read “Justice for Palestine,” “Contract Now,” and “Ethnic Studies Now” as Bacow spoke. Students in the balconies draped additional banners, including one that read, “Nobody Wins When Harvard Invests in Climate Injustice, Prisons, Stolen Land, PR Debt.”
The banners appeared to represent causes taken up by a variety of student activist organizations, including Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, and Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine.
At the end of his five-minute speech, as Bacow thanked parents, the students began chanting, “Bacow, Bacow, you can’t hide. We’ve got history on our side.” They chanted for about three minutes before walking out of the auditorium to shouts of, “We’ll be back, we’ll be back!”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton wrote in an emailed statement that Bacow was “pleased” to be able to speak to families.
“President Bacow was pleased to have the opportunity to speak with parents during their visit to Harvard,” Newton.
Larry D. Kruguer – a parent who attended the remarks — said he was “not 100 percent sure” that he felt the speech was an appropriate venue for the protest.
“As it became more prolonged, I think to some degree it may have had a reverse effect, in the sense that it may have been a little bit overkill to some people in the audience not knowing what it was all about,” Kruguer said. “It could be looked upon as not appropriate of the occasion, versus doing it as people are walking out, or providing the opportunity for more one-on-one discussion.”
Still, Kruguer said he understood why students wanted to protest. He added that he saw student activists at other events during Junior Families Weekend.
“It was a little surprising, but I get it, they’re obviously trying to get maximum exposure and try to create awareness for their cause,” he said.
On Sunday, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard also held an “oil spill” demonstration in the Smith Campus Center, per a post the group made to its Facebook. In the post, the group encouraged parents to send letters to President Bacow about divestment.
“While Harvard showed parents how it's educating their children to be the world's next citizen leaders, we made sure to talk with parents highlight the unethical investments in the fossil fuel industry that make Harvard anything but a leader on the climate crisis,” the post reads.
The Harvard Ethic Studies Coalition, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, the Palestine Solidarity Committee, Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine, and the Task Force on Asian and Pacific American Studies did not respond to requests for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With postseason play fast approaching, Harvard faced a difficult road trip against the Ivy League’s top two teams this past weekend. After suffering a 66-45 loss Friday night to league-leading No. 25 Princeton, the Crimson struggled again Saturday in a 70-48 defeat to Penn.
HARVARD 45, PRINCETON 66 
The shooting woes from last weekend’s loss at Columbia followed Harvard (14-9, 5-5 Ivy League) into New Jersey Friday night against Princeton (21-1, 9-0), as the Crimson shot just 26% from the field and 18% from the three-point line. No starters managed to score in double figures, and junior forward Maddie Stuhlreyer led the offense with a career-high 11 points off the bench.
The struggles offensively were apparent from the start, with Princeton jumping out to an early 9-2 lead. After Harvard cut the Tiger lead to two midway through the first quarter, though, a series of empty looks from three and missed layups inside gave Princeton a comfortable 17-7 lead heading into the second quarter.
“We talked about throwing the first punch,” said head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. I felt we tried hard to prepare to throw the first punch. Four of the first five possessions were turnovers. Our top two scorers shot very poorly. The shots are not that much different. We feed off of [their scoring]. We have shooting nights like that, and we can’t start every game with turnovers like we have.”
The Crimson did shoot a perfect six-for-six at the free throw line Friday night. Despite this efficiency, shooting from the foul line only six times compared to Princeton’s 25 attempts points to Harvard’s difficulty in forcing the issue inside the paint. This lack of aggression spread into play on the fastbreak, where the Crimson was outscored 12-0.
“We better run, we were all about running,” said Delaney-Smith following the loss. “We were back on our heels [Friday night]. We are a good running team [...], and that hasn’t shown up.”
As the turnovers and poor shooting continued, the 12-point lead Princeton enjoyed at halftime slowly grew to 20 through the third and fourth quarters. This provided an opportunity, however, for Coach Delaney-Smith to give some of her more inexperienced, younger players valuable playing time against a nationally-ranked opponent.
“I think my bench is pretty young, so I don’t always expect for them to have enormous stats. The fact that Maddie [Stuhlreyer] was able to score for us is a good thing,” said Delaney-Smith.
Seven players saw action off the bench, with Stuhlreyer’s 11-point performance providing hope for improved depth as Harvard enters March and postseason play.
HARVARD 48, PENN 70 
The Crimson hit the road once again to face conference rival Penn (17-5, 7-2) on Saturday, with the hungry Quaker squad seeking to avenge its loss in Cambridge earlier this season and solidify its strong second-place position in the Ivy League standings.
Mirroring the beginning of Friday night’s contest, poor shooting and turnovers from Harvard allowed Penn to jump out to an early 12-0 lead. Much needed first quarter offense came from triples from sophomore guard Maggie McCarthy and freshman guard Lola Mullaney, but the Crimson’s 3:7 assist-to-turnover ratio gave Penn a comfortable 24-10 lead by the quarter’s end.
Sophomore guard Tess Sussman and her four first half field goals led Harvard in a much stronger effort to close out the half, as the Quakers only outscored the Crimson by two in the second quarter. Sussman turned in a solid eight-rebound, three-assist performance, tying Mullaney with a game-high ten points as well. McCarthy, the third starter in Delaney-Smith’s three guard lineup, shot a perfect three-for-three from the three-point line and added six rebounds.
“We want McCarthy to shoot more, she doesn’t shoot enough,” said Delaney-Smith. “We have to put [the poor shooting] behind us, we have to get in the gym and put shots up and make adjustments.”
The offensive woes also carried over to the defensive end of the floor, an area Harvard has taken immense pride in all season long.
“We are a very good defensive team [...] our defense is even paying the price,” said Delaney-Smith. “When we would have some off offensive games, we were animals on the defensive end, and now it’s affecting us on the defensive end. And maybe it’s the pressure of the league, or the pressure of the tournament being at Harvard, I’m sure it’s a lot of that.”
Bright spots for the Crimson continue to be found on the bench, where Delaney-Smith once again gave extended playing time to seven reserves. Freshman guard Annie Stritzel built off her strong play last weekend with seven-points, three-steals, and many hustle plays that do not appear in the box score but add value to her time on the court.
Harvard is eager to return to Lavietes Pavilion this weekend for its final regular season home contests after the demanding four-game road stretch. The Crimson will take on the surging Columbia Lions (15-8, 6-4) on Friday and look to improve its seeding in the conference tournament with Saturday’s matchup against the Cornell Big Red (9-13, 2-8).

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s swimming and diving team finished the four-day-long Ivy League Championships this past Saturday at the Katherine Moran Coleman Aquatics Center at Brown University. Many program records and several pool records were broken as the Crimson placed second with 1462 points to Princeton with 1569 in the league championship meet.
Right out of the gate, on day one of competition, first-year Felicia Pasadyn, junior Jaycee Yegher, first-year Adaline Rose Bullock, and senior Mei Lynn Colby swam a 1:37.81 for first in the 200-yard medley relay, beating Princeton at the wall by five hundredths of a second and setting a new Harvard program record by two seconds.
Shortly after, one of the highlights of the entire competition occurred in the 800-yard freestyle relay as the Crimson squad — consisting of senior tri-captain Miki Dahlke, sophomore Samantha Shelton, junior Kennidy Quist, and Pasadyn — finished in 6:59.92, putting up the fourth-best time in the nation this season. This earned them an NCAA A-cut qualifying spot, while destroying another program record set two years ago (7:05.06) by more than five seconds — and setting a new Ivy League meet record. It will be the first time since 1998 that a Harvard women’s relay will compete at the NCAA Division I Championship meet.
Reflecting on how hard the quartet trained for the relay, Pasadyn said, “Watching each other come into practice every day with a goal in mind allowed us to have faith in each other when the race rolled around … the race was incredible — I had tears in my eyes seeing that determination and dedication pay off.”
Pasadyn was named one of the three High Point Swimmers of the Meet after continuing to dominate throughout the competition. After day one’s relays, she went on to win the 200-yard IM over Princeton’s Christie Chong by two seconds, setting a program and pool record of 1:55.88. She continued her trips to the podium on day three, winning her second individual Ivy League champion honors in the 400-yard individual medley with a commanding 4:08.47, another pool and program record. On night four, she won her third individual event with a program and Ivy League meet best 1:52.56 in the 200-yard backstroke.
Dahlke also continued to have a fantastic meet, winning the 200-yard butterfly with a program record time of 1:55.51, and taking second in the 500-yard free with a program-best 4:39.30. She then won 100-yard butterfly Ivy League champion honors — in 51.88 — for the third year in a row, beating her own program record by a hundredth of a second, setting a pool record, and earning an NCAA B-cut time. Dahlke was named the Career High Point Swimmer at the end of the meet.
Both swimmers also competed in the 400-yard freestyle relay with Shelton and Quist, as well as in the 400-yard medley relay with Yegher and Quist. On the fourth and final night, the 400-yard free relay registered another NCAA A-cut qualifying time of 3:14.48, setting yet another Harvard, Ivy League meet, and pool record. The 400-yard medley relay also clinched first, with a program record of 3:32.72.
Crimson divers played a key role in the team’s success as sophomore Morgane Herculano placed first with a score of 292.05 points on the 1-meter board. First-years Evie Geier and Elizabeth Miclau also reached the podium, placing sixth and eighth, respectively. Later on, junior diver Georgina Milne won the 3-meter diving title with a season- and career-best score of 323.25. Sophomore Esther Lawrence placed third with 309.70, and first-year Elizabeth Miclau finished fourth with 308.00.
When asked about the season so far, Herculano said, “I performed well in meets, but most of all I have had so much fun at practice every day with my teammates. As a team we’ve all been working really hard at practice, pushing and supporting each other, and I believe that our performance at Ivies reflects that dedication.”
Senior Mei Lynn Colby came 13 hundredths of a second from beating a seven-year program record in the 50-yard freestyle, swimming 22.58. Colby also swam in the 200-yard freestyle relay with Quist, first-year Darlene Fung, and Dahlke, who broke a three-year-old program record by seven hundredths of a second with a time of 1:29.80.
The barrage of program records continued when Yegher captured first in the 100-yard breastroke in 59.76, and first-year Adaline Rose Bullock won the 100-yard backstroke in 53.55, an NCAA B-cut qualifying time. Yegher also captured first in the 200-yard breaststroke, with yet another Harvard, Ivy, and pool record of 2:08.47.
“Qualifying for NCAAs is always a challenge because every year is different,” Herculano said, referencing the different pools and competition. “The main goal was definitely to perform at Ivies, and right now I can only say that I am extremely motivated, and that I am going to continue to work hard this spring.”
While Princeton snapped Harvard’s two-year reign as Ivy League Champions, the Crimson’s future is bright, and the season continues for several swimmers. The NCAA Division I Women’s Swimming and Diving Championships will take place on March 18-21 at the Ramsey Center in Athens, Ga., and several divers will compete at NCAA Zones to qualify for the national meet.
“I can say that our grit and willingness to put in the work for a long term result will not cease because Ivies is over,” Pasadyn said, in reference to the meets ahead. “I am incredibly blessed to attend such a high-level meet with a group of empowering and dedicated women.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After taking a commanding 2-0 game lead against her opponent, No. 2 Princeton University’s Elle Ruggiero, Harvard co-captain Gina Kennedy found herself in a 7-7 deadlock in game three. However, she buckled down and attacked Ruggiero with a flurry of vicious cross-courts and tight drop shots to go up 10-7, eventually winning the game with a backhand drop to secure the critical first-seed matchup for the Crimson.
Kennedy’s strong effort was one of Harvard’s six victories in its 6-1 thumping of Princeton in the finals of the Howe Cup on Sunday. With the victory, the squad completed its sixth straight undefeated season and claimed its sixth straight national championship title.
According to Kennedy, the team’s ability to remain cool amidst high expectations was key to their eventual championship.
“I think we were expected to win,” Kennedy said. “But we're just so humbled by the fact that [we] won. Because we’ve won the last [few] years in a row, there's obviously a lot of pressure to make sure that we will perform our best.”
The team’s relentless work ethic and commitment to practice were also instrumental to its success, according to both Kennedy and Harvard coach Mike Way.
“I'm just so proud of the team because everyone puts in so much work every single day,” Kennedy said. “And [they] always perform so well when it comes to crunch time. So yeah, just really proud and extremely happy right now.”
“You won't find a more proud coach than I am,” Way said. “Of [associate head coach Hameed Ahmed and assistant coach Luke Hammond], the captains, and the whole squad, and the fact that they put up with me and all my repetition, which is what we coaches are about.”
First-year Brittany Sun, who became aware of Harvard’s championship streak while she was in high school, described her first season on the squad — and being a part of the team’s eventual victory — as “surreal.”
“I just heard about Harvard's amazing streak of winning nationals, year after year,” Sun said. “The feeling’s pretty surreal when you're actually on the team [and you] experience it for yourself because you've always read about it and seen it, [but] for the first time you’re actually here to experience it, which is a pretty incredible experience.”
The Crimson faced stiff competition on its path to the championship. Before facing off against Princeton, Harvard had to make its way through the fourth-seed Trinity College Bantams. Although the tough semifinal matchup threatened to throw Harvard off balance, the squad played well and parlayed the momentum into an equally strong performance in the finals match, according to Way.
“I think [playing against Trinity in the semifinals] gave them confidence because they played well,” Way said. “They executed the plan [and] that actually gave them a little boost of confidence for today. So it was good to have a tough match yesterday, and to be tested by Trinity — I think it helped us today.”
With a 3-0 sweep of her opponent to help Harvard claim another title, Kennedy put the final touches on a glittering squash career at Harvard. With her time as a Crimson athlete coming to an end, Kennedy has taken the time to reflect on her experience as a member of the squad, especially as a captain in her final year.
“We just wanted to focus a lot on making sure everyone was clear in the game plan and preparing well,” Kennedy said. “Like I said, everyone's just got such a high work ethic — it was really easy to lead this team.”
This year, Kennedy led the team alongside co-captain Amelia Henley. Kennedy and Henley have been playing squash together since they were both ten years old. They end their time playing alongside each other with four championships in four years.
“We’ve both kind of been on a huge journey with squash together,” Kennedy said. “From playing in the same county when we were younger, coming to Harvard together and then being able to co-captain the Harvard squash team together. It just seemed right and it was the perfect way to end my time on the team.”
As the curtain falls on yet another stellar season by the Crimson, the team looks to the Individual National Championships. In two weeks, six to eight Harvard players will make their way down to the University of Pennsylvania to compete against the nation’s top collegiate players. Draws and tournament information will be released the week of the tournament.

 On February 13, Mario Dedivanovic delivered a talk hosted by the Harvard College Albanian Student Association as part of their Leadership Initiative Series. The event took place in Emerson Hall and was moderated by Harvard Business School Professor Youngme Moon. His talk revolved around his upbringing, professional development, and aspirations, as well as the inevitable challenges faced in the beauty industry. Dedivanovic, makeup artist for high-profile and loyal clients such as Kim Kardashian West, Kylie Jenner, Jennifer Lopez, Ariana Grande and more, has sold out his limited-edition collaborations with Anastasia Beverly Hills and KKW Beauty by Kim Kardashian West. Ten years ago he launched the Masterclass, a makeup technique class that has been taught around the world. Here are some words of wisdom I took away from Dedivanovic’s talk.
Do what you’re actually passionate about
For most Harvard students, it seems like there are only three different paths in life worth pursuing: careers in STEM, investment banking, or consulting. So when people like Dedivanovic, a globally renowned makeup artist and entrepreneur within the beauty industry, come to campus, life is really put into perspective and the Harvard bubble temporarily pops. There are so many more opportunities out there and so many more areas to cultivate our talents within — sometimes we need someone successful like Dedivanovic from the outside to remind us of just that.
Success doesn’t happen overnight
It’s not like Dedivanovic’s rise to fame happened with the snap of his fingers. That’s just not how it works in the real world, even for us students pursuing a Harvard degree. Mark Zuckerberg had to start at the bottom!
Dedivanovic began his career packing bags at a grocery store when he was just 12 years old (so that he could buy a pair of Nike Jordans he really wanted). Then, when he was 17, Dedivanovic started working as a greeter at Sephora — the first Sephora that opened in the United States. He claimed that when he first walked into that Sephora, he “got a physical feeling, and that [he] knew [he] had to work there,” but his mother objected. Nonetheless, Dedivanovic applied for the job back in 2000, a job that paid only $7 per hour.
One day, however, a woman was looking for lipstick and asked him to help her choose a color. While he was not a makeup artist there at the time, “something in [him] just went to do it,” and the woman loved the color he selected for her. At that moment, he had what he calls an “epiphany,” that he knew he had “found [his] calling,” his destiny. He finally found something he could “work hard towards, to excel at” and to make his mom proud. But he knew he had years and years of work ahead of him, and so the next day he “went into the library and began the research process of what makeup artistry is, what fashion is, who are the prominent photographers and makeup artists” to understand the ins and outs of a career as a makeup artist. 19 years later, the Makeup by Mario x Sephora Brush Collaboration was featured “in every single Sephora store in the world.”
Listen to your gut — your opinion is the only one that matters at the end of the day
Dedivanovic explained that every major milestone for him resulted from going against the current, rather than listening to his agents and even his own peers. His agent in the early years of his career had been grooming Dedivanovic to be an “elitist makeup artist,” adamantly advising Dedivanovic against working with Kim K, a reality star who “was not globally famous the way she is now,” but Dedivanovic “knew there was something incredibly special about her.” Lo and behold, today almost every household in America knows the Kardashian name, and Dedivanovic’s collaboration with KKW Beauty sold out. How’s that for a success story?
Get that degree!
As hard as the journey might seem, Dedivanovic, a “big believer in college education,” always tells young people to “go to school and get your degree.” So, naturally, now we have to get our degree.
Be true to yourself
At the 2019 American Influencer Awards, Dedivanovic “took the stage and publicly came out” while accepting the Artistic Achievement Award. He had gotten to the point where he couldn’t “block and suppress” anymore — this was the final step in his “yearning to seek true happiness.” The next day, when he was no longer hiding from the public and even his own family, he “felt for the first time what a glimpse of true happiness was.” We’re not crying, you are.
Embrace that trend-setter mentality
So this is when I worked up the courage to stand up in a room of at least 200 people and ask Dedivanovic a question: “What have been some of your most favorite makeup trends recently?” He responded by saying that he thinks trends are fun but he doesn’t really take them too seriously, and he does what “is the most flattering” for his client rather than for just “a moment.” Finally, Dedivanovic rounded up his answer with “I’m a trend-setter, not a trend-follower.” We love that energy.
