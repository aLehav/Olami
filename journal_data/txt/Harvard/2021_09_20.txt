After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Growing up, there was a particular ficus tree that stood proudly in our backyard. This was, for all intents and purposes, not your average tree. More than a simple mess of bark and leaves, she is more accurately described as a friend, and, with that, one that was fundamental to the rhythm of my childhood.
This Goliath was the focal point of the make-believe games my sister and I spent hours playing, a refuge from the sea monsters and kraken that had infested our imaginations for the day. She was the gathering place around which my friends would flock, each fiending for a turn to swing from the rope that hung from her branches.
Some afternoons she was my only companion, and I look back on those days wondering if I’ll ever be in such good company again. Day after day, she provided her protective branches and crevices as spaces for my solo adventures through the mysterious places of a child’s imagination. When I was a pirate, she was my ship; and as a pilot, she was my plane. Before I knew meditation, she showed me the power of intentional silence and though I didn’t yet know beauty, she still offered me a place to sit and watch the sun as it tumbled out of the sky each night.
There was a certain generosity to this tree, a wealth of creative inspiration she never failed to share.
As recently as the past year, it was beneath her benevolent shade that my curiosity and creativity were reignited through art projects and literature. Though I might’ve outgrown them, those familiar pockets and footholds were right where I’d left them, strong as ever to support me as I climbed up to be with my old friend.
The same trees that give us our capacity for speech by breathing life into our lungs also supply the tools we use to immortalize this speech: pencils and paper. However, these instruments have become but two among the growing list of disposable possessions we have long forgotten the origin of.
Industrial manufacturing, especially of such commonplace things as writing utensils, obscures the living origins of the resources that go into our everyday products. Every tool, toy, and utensil we’ve ever created has come from the Earth — a fact that I think could redefine the relationships we have with seemingly lifeless objects.
In the case of pencils and paper, we have lost our respect for the trees that were felled. Robin Wall Kimmerer encourages us to be in relationship with the items we interact with daily, saying, “... looking over the objects on my desk — the basket, the candle, the paper — I delight in following their origins back to the ground. I twirl a pencil — a magic wand lathed from incense cedar — between my fingers.”​
For a moment, imagine holding a pencil. Can you feel its weight? Its straight edges and sharp point? Instead of understanding this possession as an abundant, limitless commodity, is it possible to instead feel the pressure on our fingertips and understand that we’re holding the weight of an entire life that has been gifted to us in the name of creativity?
And as you touch this miracle to a sheet of paper, consider the body that was sacrificed to provide you a blank space for your musings. Doing this, we might think twice about the words we choose to bleed into the world. When we’re able to recognize the marvel of using these tools to write and draw, the entire process becomes interwoven with an almost mystical air. It becomes exciting; meaningful even.
What have become conceptualized as mundane items are actually anything but. Within our notebooks we hold the weight of lives generously given so that we might place upon them words that can outlast us once we are gone. What we have in a blank sheet is no simple piece of paper; instead, it can be seen as a portal towards immortality. A place our minds can live on once our bodies no longer do.
As I think back to my relationship with that ficus tree, I can’t help but recognize the role she played in my creative growth. And though she wasn’t cut down and processed into pencils and paper, I keep her in mind when I use such tools and imagine the tree from which they were sourced and the little girl they might’ve inspired during their own time on Earth.
In the same way that the tree in Shel Silverstein’s “The Giving Tree” gave to the boy all that it had, I imagine my ficus readily sacrificing the branches that I’ve grown too old to climb for pencils and paper so that she might continue to help me chase after my creative pursuits. It’s my hope that with what I bring into the world using her body, and those of her kind, that she, like Silverstein’s tree, might see what I’ve done and be happy.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Allston campus is finally filled with students. After over two decades of planning, a financial-crisis-induced hiatus, and five years’ worth of construction, Harvard students can now sit through lectures on the other side of the Charles at the brand new Science and Engineering Complex, the first cornerstone of a still-developing campus.
The project hasn’t been without controversy — and our own view of its impact hasn’t always remained optimistic. From concerns surrounding local affordability to misgivings about its appearance, Allston residents have made clear their discomfort with the new Harvard complex; our own board has expressed unease regarding its potential gentrifying effect while lauding its innovative attempts at thoughtful development. The overall local footprint of the SEC is still hard to ascertain, and sure to prompt further scrutiny in the future.
But the Allston annex is now an undeniable part of our campus reality. It’s a place where we travel to and take classes every week, another inconvenient address on our regular schedules. Now the question is whether our campus’s geographic expansion will serve or disappoint the student body.
From this student-centric perspective alone, we find reason to celebrate the Allston campus. Its completion isn’t just an exciting chance for the student body to enjoy newer and more impressive facilities, but also an imperative if our institution is to maintain its leadership in non-humanities fields. The University’s decision to pour such time and capital into the SEC is a welcome tribute to all the Harvard students who choose to pursue studies in science and engineering, an acknowledgment of their contributions to our once humanities-focused institution. The imposing physical structure is a symbol of Harvard’s commitment to its School Of Engineering And Applied Sciences.
The new complex will also offer an unexpected boon for student athletes, decreasing their isolation by “shifting the center of gravity” across the Charles. Our athletes can now enjoy an integrated academic space on their bank of the river, complete with a constant flow of their non-athlete peers.

Obvious beneficiaries aside, the entirety of the student body ought to make the most of our new facilities. If physical spaces define our reality — fixing who we see and when, inspiring our thoughts, shaping our health — we hope the Allston campus contributes to the building of a strong, collaborative community of interdisciplinary learners. To this effect, we encourage Harvard to follow through with its liberal arts values when scheduling SEC classes. Placing more widely sought-after courses, such as General Education lectures, in Allston could encourage cross-pollination among disciplines, de-stratifying our academic communities: Offering “GENED 1033: Conflict Resolution in a Divided World” over the river this fall semester has been a good start.
This ideal Allston we crave is hardly a given — in fact, it’s heavily contingent on University policy. From a purely logistical perspective, having a campus a mile away could prove challenging: Ensuring a smooth commute, cutting down on travel time, and easing scheduling are absolutely crucial. If Allston is to become a multidisciplinary hub, students must be able to get to and from classes easily and conveniently, otherwise the temptation to stick to a one field, one campus schedule might become hard to resist. Because of our limited experience with the commute, Harvard must maintain a pulse on these issues and prove responsive to the needs of students and faculty.
Finally and more pressingly, the University must realize that happy neighbors make for a happy campus. Continued engagement with Allston residents is vital, as are active efforts to ensure that local Boston youth and children benefit from this new facility — there should not be a hard boundary between the Harvard and Allston communities. Ramping up or expanding current worthwhile initiatives, like the lesser-known Harvard Local Housing Collaborative, would help, as would a firm University commitment to rent control and affordable housing.
The Science and Engineering Complex is now quite literally set in stone — but its impact on Harvard students and Allston residents isn’t. It’s up to the University and our student body to make it what it deserves to be.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s newly formed Committee to Articulate Principles on Renaming explicitly instructs its members “to ensure that renaming won’t result in erasing history.” But the recent rebranding at the Radcliffe Institute has clearly put an important piece of that history at risk.  Slapping “Harvard” in front of what is now to be called the “Harvard Radcliffe Institute” is a retrograde step, conveying the same devaluation and loss of sovereignty once marked by a woman’s change of name upon marriage.
With Radcliffe College, once Harvard’s sister school, gone, the institute remains the sole institutional flag-bearer of a name that still represents, for a great many, the long and continuing struggle for parity. The rebranding is particularly baffling — and galling — because the wound has been self-inflicted, imposed by the institute itself. At a stroke, it diminishes the legacy of women’s history at Harvard, hard-fought since the late 19th century.
In officially joining the University in 1893, the new college took its name from Ann Radcliffe, an English Puritan, and Harvard’s first female benefactor. She endowed an annual scholarship with a gift of £100 in 1643, not long after Harvard was founded. Other candidates had been considered for this high honor before Radcliffe was chosen. Philanthropists were rejected on the grounds that enshrining one major donor at the outset would deter other major donors from contributing down the road. The most prominent individual under consideration was Elizabeth Agassiz, the first president of the Harvard Annex, where women had been receiving instruction from Harvard faculty since 1879. Alas, the surname Agassiz was already well known, associated as it was with Elizabeth’s husband Louis, at the time a well-respected Harvard anthropologist (whose racist ideas, exposed in the 20th century, would be problematic for any institution carrying his name). A similar problem blighted the chances of Alice Longfellow, the youngest member of the committee that had established the Annex.
Ann Radcliffe posed no such difficulties. Despite being known as Lady Moulson as the wife of a lord mayor of London, the Harvard scholarship had been established under her own name. This may have been as important a factor in the adoption of “Radcliffe” as her pioneering philanthropy.  Implicit in the choice was the conviction that a woman might “make a name for herself” rather than be defined by her husband’s. Armed with the college education that Harvard would now legitimize, a graduate of Radcliffe might be in a position to forge an identity of her own. At a time when marrying and taking a husband’s name still meant the loss of property and parental rights, not to mention the renunciation of personal freedoms, the elevation of the name “Radcliffe” carried a radical if covert charge, one that would continue to resonate, and that is still palpable today. Sadly, the current University administration has chosen to ignore this undercurrent of feeling.
An observer from the Listener, writing in 1893, seems to have understood the significance of the name far better than many of those meddling with it today:
“It is eminently fitting that, since it is decided to honor thus this early benefactor of the university, her maiden name, and not her husband’s name should be chosen. It was the woman, and not the woman’s husband — her name, and not the name that swallowed hers up — that should be honored … A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.”
The “re-branding” has hit alumnae of my generation, from the ’60s and ’70s, particularly hard. Our collective distress may be partly explained by the fact that our college years pre-dated the rise of second-wave feminism, when the latent promise of “Radcliffe” remained unfulfilled. Harvard professors and career services routinely discouraged us from pursuing graduate work in areas where we were not welcome. Women were still expected to marry after graduation and if they chose to continue with their own names, forced to re-apply for bank accounts, passports, and voter registration. At the same time, it was impossible for unmarried women to obtain mortgages, loans, and credit cards. Our lives were still largely framed and constrained by relations — or lack of connections — to men.
Thankfully, many of the more egregious restrictions have now disappeared. We no longer need to rely on the Lucy Stone League, established in 1921 to advocate for the right of women to keep their own name after marriage (Stone, the 19th-century feminist, had insisted that “a wife should no more take her husband’s name than he should hers.”) But it would be a mistake to assume that the playing field has been magically leveled or that the call to action taken up by the original Radcliffe Institute in 1961 — the issues of “women, gender and society” — have been resolved. One has only to look at the uneven impacts of the pandemic lockdowns on the domestic and working lives of women, including women with academic aspirations. Heightened racial disparities have proved particularly damaging to women of color.
If, as we hope, the institute is to continue to play a leadership role in this field, it must lead with the name that, from its very inception, has embodied an unwavering commitment to gender justice.

Harvard Kennedy School’s Government Performance Lab announced last week the selection of five areas that will participate in a new initiative aimed at implementing alternative responses to non-violent 911 calls.
The initiative is supported by the Government Performance Lab at the Kennedy School’s Taubman Center for State and Local Government, which works with state and local governments to find solutions to various social problems. Beginning this fall, the initiative will run for roughly 12 months.
The GPL chose Durham, N.C., Harris County, Texas, Long Beach, Calif., Philadelphia, Pa., and Phoenix, Ariz. to participate in a program that will create or improve unarmed emergency response teams that move away from traditional law enforcement by connecting residents to mental health services, substance use treatment, and other services.
The five jurisdictions were selected from an applicant pool of more than 60 across the country based on their level of “community and stakeholder engagement,” progress towards implementation of alternative 911 responses, and potential for impact, part of a growing shift around the country to find alternative approaches to public safety.
In a press release, GPL executive director Gloria Gong said she is enthusiastic about the potential for alternative 911 responses.
“It is exciting to hear from communities across the country who are committed to shaping public safety systems that are more responsive and fair, particularly for communities of color that are often poorly served by existing approaches,” Gong said.
The GPL will provide technical assistance to accelerate and enhance the implementation of alternative 911 responses, including creating training curricula for response teams, designing 911 call decision trees, preparing community briefing materials, and procuring services from local providers.
“Building out alternative 911 response models can empower communities to provide a wider array of services to residents that better reflect the challenges they face and reduce opportunities for unintended harm,” Gong added.
Local government leaders also said they were eager to work with the GPL to improve public safety in their cities.
“We want Durham residents who call 911 to receive the most effective and appropriate response to serve their needs,” Durham Mayor Stephen M. Schewel said in the press release. “Sometimes that is a police officer, and sometimes it’s a mental health worker or some other trained, unarmed crisis responder.”
Other local leaders said the initiative is an opportunity to build on progress they have already made.
“We are grateful for the opportunity to create an alternate crisis response team with the support of the Harvard Kennedy School Government Performance Lab,” Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia said. “This effort builds on a long history of providing health-first approaches to people experiencing homelessness and mental illness in Long Beach.”

Holyoke Street came alive Sunday as people square danced, ate barbeque, and drank beer at the “Hoedown on Holyoke,” a day-long block party organized by the Harvard Square Business Association.
The eight-hour-long event officially welcomed the Smoke Shop BBQ, which opened its Holyoke Street location last October, to Harvard Square. At the block party, the restaurant served up some of its staples, like barbeque sliders, hot dogs, mac and cheese, corn bread, and sweet and spicy coleslaw.
The Smoke Shop BBQ was voted Boston’s best barbeque by Boston Magazine this year. The restaurant has four other locations in the state besides Harvard Square: Assembly Row, Kendall Square, Seaport, and TD Garden. In addition to dining and catering, the restaurant offers a variety of in-house special events ranging from whiskey tastings to a Kentucky Derby party.
The hoedown also featured performances by comedian Jimmy Tingle, the Frank Drake Trio, and DJ Ron Ferrell.
Liz Cohen, a resident of Arlington, said she came across the hoedown while searching online for fun activities near Boston.
“It smells amazing,” Cohen said. “We came here actually trying to do the country dancing — the square dancing.”
Wynne L. Freed, an attendee who lives near Central Square, said she was especially excited for the closing act, local performer Frank Drake, whom she called “an amazing musician.”
While the Harvard Square Business Association hosted several events last year with Covid-19 safety precautions, it did not resume its programming in earnest again until this past summer, according to Denise A. Jillson, the president of the association.
“We knew going into this event that it was going to be mellow, and it would be a little bit quieter, but it’s been very nice,” Jillson said in an interview at the event. “We want to be able to assure people that they can come to Harvard Square, that we can run these events, that they will be safe, that we will take all the precautions that we need to be outside.”
Jillson added Cambridge residents can look forward to more events in the coming months, including Oktoberfest and Winter Carnival.

First-year students beginning the Public Policy Master’s Program at the Harvard Kennedy School this month became the inaugural class to participate in two half-semester race and racism classes, after the school moved to expand the mandatory courses from two weeks to an entire semester.
The dual courses — “Race and Racism in the Making of the United States as a Global Power” and “Race and Racism in Public Policies, Practices, and Perspectives” — were first introduced as a requirement last fall, but were covered virtually in an intensive two-week format following first-year students’ orientation in 2020. HKS made the class mandatory amid the nationwide racial reckoning last summer, following years of calls from student activists for more instruction on race and colonialism at the Kennedy School.
These courses are currently only offered to first-year students in the MPP program, as the Kennedy School did not mandate similar course requirements for students in other programs.
Camille N. Choe, a current student in the class, said she enjoyed the perspective from which the material has been covered thus far and emphasized the need for students to engage with its content.
“The readings Professor [Khalil] Muhammad has us do are a very good way about thinking about race and racism in a more structural manner, as opposed to thinking of it as individual interactions,” Choe said.
“I think it’s one of those courses that really does have a really deep impact,” she added. “Race and racism is such a fundamental issue that I really strongly do believe that everyone should have a space to study and sort of discuss these kinds of issues.”
Deepanshu Aggarwal, an international student from India, said the course is giving him a new outlook on the issue of racism in the United States, a topic he said he was previously unfamiliar with.
“What I’ve learned about racism over here is something beyond superficial. Earlier my understanding was, ‘Okay, it’s simply something that’s happening right now. It started off with slave trade,’” Aggarwal said.
“The kind of readings that we are taught in the curriculum – it took me reading those readings to realize that debate also extends to the fact that not everyone thinks about the founding day of America in the same way,” he added.
Besides having a longer period of time to process the material, the current first-year students have another benefit compared to students who took the course last year: in-person discussion.
​​Ezinwanne O. “Adaeze” Okoli, who took the class last fall, said the delivery of the course’s material was diminished by the online format and short time-frame, especially during virtual small-group discussions.
“It wasn’t enough time to build up that trust and rapport to actually get any depth,” Okoli said. “The level of conversation that you need to have around these things requires a level of trust and a level or ability that is very difficult to cultivate over Zoom and very difficult to cultivate day one.”
Grace Y. Park said the in-person format of the course has allowed for more meaningful discussions with peers.
“One of my close friends in the class was trying to make a comment, but he was kind of struggling to put it into words, so we walked out together, and then we ended up talking for an hour-and-a-half about what he was kind of struggling to articulate,” Park said. “I think that wouldn’t have been possible if we just exited out of our Zoom rooms.”
Though she said she enjoys the class, Park also explained that the “varying levels of experience” with the material among her classmates at times can lead to “uneven” conversations.
“I wonder if there’s a model where people who feel a little bit more well-versed in the theory or have a foundational understanding of racism in the world and the United States could delve into deeper, more substantive conversations earlier,” Park said.
Despite the expansion of the course from two weeks to one semester, Didier P. Dumerjean said he believed the length of the course still does not allow for deep understanding of the course material.
“I think, one semester, to be quite frank, is insufficient,” Dumerjean said. “For people who have not engaged in these conversations, who do not understand how power is distributed across the globe, and how these social hierarchies persist and are pervasive, it’s particularly important that you start to engage with these [topics] now given the positions of authority that we’ll be in.”
Sara Asad ’17, a student in the Master in Business Administration/Master in Public Administration-International Development program, said the demand from students for race and racism courses exceeds the current offerings.
“Students want to be able to learn more about equity issues not just from race and equity in the U.S., but also on a more international level, as you think about colonialism and some of the impacts and repercussions that that has had in our society,” Asad said.
Professor Khalil G. Muhammad, who teaches the first module, said there is “opportunity for growth” regarding race courses at HKS, but pointed to the school’s recent expansion in this area as a positive sign.
“Over the past three or four years, the number of course offerings have definitely increased with an increase in faculty who can work in this area, as the school moves towards more core focus across different cohorts,” Muhammad said.

The positivity rate for Covid-19 on Harvard’s campus dropped to 0.16 percent over the past week, and the University said it has yet to identify a positive case caused by transmission in the classroom.
Harvard University Health Services Executive Director Giang T. Nguyen touted the University’s “campus protection strategy” for combating Covid-19 in a Thursday interview with the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication.
In the interview, Nguyen said HUHS has not yet identified any case in which someone was infected through exposure in the classroom.
“At Harvard, we have created an environment for teaching and learning that enhances the safety of everyone involved, thanks to a range of preventive measures,” Nguyen said, citing frequent testing, mandatory indoor mask use, and comprehensive contact tracing.
HUHS has identified indoor social gatherings where people remove their masks as the greatest cause of transmission.
“In social settings, staying safe means keeping close contacts to a minimum, keeping your mask on, and planning outdoor events whenever possible,” Nguyen said.
Though a rash of Covid-19 cases among undergraduates at the start of the semester caused concern and led Harvard to implement more frequent testing, the positivity rate among College students has since declined. The overwhelming majority of positive cases over the past week have been identified in graduate students, according to Harvard’s Covid-19 dashboard.
Even though some classes are not conducive to social distancing, Nguyen explained that masking indoors is sufficient to prevent transmission.
“When everyone is properly masked, physical distancing is less critical than masking,” Nguyen said. “Medical experts on our advisory group have emphasized this point, noting the experience within clinical settings throughout the pandemic.”
While students have reported confusion over how to respond to contract tracing notifications, Nguyen advised those who are notified that there is “no need to panic.”
Nguyen said students who learn that they are a close contact should immediately submit an extra Covid test. If they are fully vaccinated and do not exhibit symptoms, they can continue to attend class but should avoid large social gatherings. If students who are notified they are a close contact develop symptoms or are not vaccinated, they should quarantine and notify HUHS.
Nguyen acknowledged the stress caused by Covid-19, and encouraged Harvard affiliates to prioritize their mental health.
“Taking care of yourself and each other goes beyond COVID safety protocols, too. The pandemic has brought with it added stress and anxiety to so many people,” Nguyen said. “Be kind and considerate with your fellow Harvard community members and reach out to a professional if you need help yourself.”

What’s everyone’s absolute favorite activity at the beginning of each semester? If you said giving the Harvard introduction until your words lose meaning or going through the same icebreakers (“My favorite color is blue!”) in every single club, then we’re on the same page. We’ve come up with some ~alternative~ icebreakers to really spice up those awkward meetings with random people whose names you’ll never remember.
What is your favorite item that you brought with you to Harvard?
Such a sentimental question! We just love it when people talk about objects that they are passionate about. Is it the teddy bear that they’ve had since birth or their illegal microwave?
What’s your favorite song to listen to while studying?
Find out what jams play in the background as someone sobs over their CS50 pset.
Favorite HUDS dish?
There’s a lot you can learn about someone based on their go-tos from HUDS. If they mention the suspicious looking General Gao’s chicken that we’re pretty sure are just frozen chicken nuggets thrown in teriyaki sauce, maybe consider walking away from the conversation. Alternatively, you can also try asking what everyone’s best dhall hack is – it might just be your saving grace next time that meal you love to hate is on the menu.
If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go?
We bet you $5 that someone’s going to say “their bed.” Good chance for some creativity, or to plan your next dream vacation instead of studying?
What is your birth time, date, and location?
Dating at Harvard is hard. Who has time to commit to a relationship when you can barely commit to your psets? By getting someone’s time of birth, date, and location, you can figure out their Sun, Moon, and Rising horoscopes. Fear not, you no longer have to go on awkward dates with them. Just plug in their birth logistics and figure out whether or not their horoscope is compatible with yours (psst, just stay away from the Scorpio men – no offense).
We hope these alternative icebreakers help get the juices flowing on how to make your Harvard intros more spicy and less boring – after all, we can only say “name, year, house, concentration” so many times!
