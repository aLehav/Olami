After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Who should decide what is hate speech in an online global community?” That’s the question Richard Allan, Facebook’s Vice President for Policy in the Middle East and Asia, is asking in the wake of reporting on the social network’s content moderation guidelines. Reporting group ProPublica’s headline—“Facebook’s Secret Censorship Rules Protect White Men from Hate Speech But Not Black Children”—captures our almost dystopian fear of an all-powerful corporation rigging political discourse to serve shareholders, advertisers, and procrastinators the world over. Just imagine the 7,500-strong “community operations team” as uniformed  propagandists searching for content that bucks the party line, and your Orwellian masterpiece is off to a fine start.
At first glance, removing hate speech might seem to depend exclusively on moderators’ ability to judge which posts cause serious harm to users—a task difficult only because determining that harm is so tricky. Yet as Facebook acknowledges, its own categories of hate speech don’t function purely as immunizations from feeling threatened by others online.
For example, categorically demeaning African arrivals to Italy violates the social network’s rules, but advocating for proposals to deny refugees Italian welfare does not. And this remains true even if both actions cause comparable suffering to their migrant subjects. As Allan explains with reference to German debates on migrants, “we have left in place the ability for people to express their views on immigration itself. And we are deeply committed to making sure Facebook remains a place for legitimate debate.” In other words, Facebook will permit some “legitimate” posts in spite of their potential to harm shielded groups.
What kind of debate qualifies as legitimate in Facebook’s eyes? The company doesn’t say. One approach is to classify hateful content, like much-scrutinized fake news, as a subset of false speech. Group-focused hate speech contains generalizations or arguments that take no time to debunk, while more involved political content requires prohibitive resources to fact-check properly.
However, even if removing egregiously incorrect posts were a good idea, Facebook uses other variables to decide the boundaries of legitimate discussion. When then-presidential candidate Donald Trump called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, he likely ran afoul of the site’s rules against “calling for exclusion” of protected classes—but reports indicate that Facebook CEO Mark E. Zuckerberg, a former member of the Class of 2006, permitted the content to remain on his platform “because it was part of the political discourse.” The company’s efforts to exclude hate do not amount to eradicating falsehood.
Facebook’s selective moderation suggests that legitimate content for the company is not necessarily true or respectful content, but material whose publication it deems valuable from the public’s point of view. Even if the social network could have stopped users from hearing Trump’s Muslim ban speech, for instance, doing so would have prevented voters from learning something important about the candidate’s policy preferences.
This desire to inform citizens just illustrates how any outfit’s censorship practices—or lack thereof—reflect a normative set of ideas about what best serves the interests of users. When Facebook, Google, or others frame content regulation as concerned with the “safety” of users, they mask the extent to which that safety is just one piece of a broader, and possibly controversial, conception of how we should lead our digital lives.
A social network that helps to structure the discourse of nearly two billion individuals ought to justify the design it chooses for them. And to its credit, Facebook seems more interested than just about any other technology company in giving explicit voice to its vision of “building global community.” But the fact that the company’s moderation guidelines were developed ad hoc and without user input over the span of several years is worrying and hard to defend. When we stop pretending that online “platforms” are amoral structures, we also see the urgent need to scrutinize their foundations.
As it stands, the question of who ought to define and regulate hate speech is a moot one. With the exception of some European authorities, Facebook and other companies are already answering it for us, whether or not we accept their verdicts. Undoubtedly, many well-intentioned technologists envision a future in which online platforms guide political and social debate to be as robust as possible. But absent major changes, we can only hope that their utopia is not our dystopian future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRAGUE, Czech Republic—Prague reminds me of the Boston-Cambridge area in many ways. There are the cobblestoned streets, which are a constant threat to my ankles in heels. Though the city is also very walkable, the roads contain some crazy drivers who navigate narrow streets with reckless abandon. The lack of affordable housing and the large homeless population sadly also make me think of our campus’ surrounding urban environment. Although these characteristics may be associated with any major city that has been around for some time, finding these similarities have been a source of comfort while calling Prague home for a little while.
I’m two weeks in though, and I feel as if I may take my own personal version of “when in Rome…”—when at home, do as the homebodies do—too far at times. After classes that last more than two hours, all I want to do is go back to my room and nap. Once I am in bed, going out and experiencing the city feels like quite the task. It was not until a friend in the program returned from a recent trip to Budapest, attesting to the lasting vestiges of war and communism that Prague mercifully avoided almost entirely, that I realized I may be taking it a bit for granted.
Yet it amazes me how beautiful views that take your breath away on something as banal as a tram ride to class can become normalized in a person’s day-to-day. But alas, it happens and I am a testament to it just after two weeks. Imagine the outlook of Prague natives, who were born and raised here. No wonder they rarely turn their heads to look out the window on tram rides. They have seen it all countless times before. Nevertheless, I am inspired to do better as a somewhat-long-term visitor and traveler.
The similarities I found between Prague and the Boston-Cambridge area also remind me of the beauty in our own city that we all call home, at least during the school year. How often do we get through each day with the thought of the next school break to keep us going rather than considering our limited time at Harvard? I feel moved not just to live more in the moment and be mindful abroad, but also when I get back on campus in August. I want to make an effort to experience all of the things that make Boston-Cambridge unique. What is the point of living here for four years if we never leave the Harvard bubble? Being a tourist in your own city is underrated.

President of the Board of Overseers Scott A. Abell ’72, vice chair of the executive committee Tracy P. Palandjian ’93, and Susan L. Carney ’73, a federal appellate judge, will join the twelve members of the Harvard Corporation in the search for Harvard’s next president.
William F. Lee ’72, Senior Fellow of the Harvard Corporation, announced the full composition of the presidential search committee—including the three previously unnamed members from the Board of Overseers—and issued an open call for suggestions for the search to replace outgoing University President Drew G. Faust in an email Tuesday to Harvard affiliates. Past presidential searches have also been led by the Corporation in conjunction with three Overseers.
In the email Tuesday, Lee also solicited suggestion for “individuals you believe warrant serious consideration as possible candidates,” and listed a series of criteria the selection committee is considering.
“We will be seeking a person of high intellectual distinction, with proven qualities of leadership, a devotion to excellence in education and research, a capacity to guide a complex institution through times of change, a commitment to advance progress and collaboration across a wide span of academic domains, and a dedication to the ideals and values central to a community of learning,” he wrote.
Lee had previously outlined many of these criteria in an interview with the University-run Harvard Gazette about a week after University President Drew G. Faust announced she would step down in June 2018.
In the email, the selection committee will launch advisory councils for faculty, staff, and students to “reach out broadly to benefit from both general advice and specific nominations,” Lee wrote.
He asked that suggestions be emailed to psearch@harvard.edu or mailed to the Corporation’s meeting location, Loeb House in Harvard Yard.

Laura L. Chivers, a former freshman advisor who works in the Psychology Department, began her tenure as the next resident dean of Dudley House on July 1.
Chivers, a lecturer on Psychology, previously served as advising administrator and associate director of undergraduate studies in Harvard’s Psychology department for 11 years.
“I have worked closely with [resident deans] in the past to support students through academic and personal challenges, and am looking forward to stepping into these duties as a more central part of my position,” Chivers wrote in an email.
In addition to working in the Psychology department, Chivers has also served as a freshman advisor and a member of Leverett House’s Senior Common Room, according to Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. She received her undergraduate degree from Bryn Mawr College and a Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Vermont.
“I encourage each of you to reach out to Laura, and our other three new Allston Burr Assistant Deans to welcome [them] to this great community,” O’Dair wrote in an email to College staff. The appointments for new resident deans—formally known as Allston Burr assistant deans—in Dunster, Eliot, and Winthrop Houses also became effective on July 1.
Resident deans are the principal link between undergraduates and College administrators. Among other responsibilities, they advise House residents on academic issues, as well as represent students before disciplinary bodies like the Administrative Board and Honor Council.
Although resident deans teach as half-time faculty members, their administrative duties have become increasingly “bureaucratic” over the past few decades.
Dudley is Harvard’s “13th House” and is home to non-residential students. These include undergraduates residing off-campus, participants in the Visiting Undergraduate Student Program, and around 30 College students living in the Dudley Co-op—an alternative living arrangement where residents share household chores and pay a reduced housing fee. In total, approximately 100 undergraduates are affiliated with Dudley House.
Chivers succeeds Christopher M. Gilbert, who had been Dudley’s resident dean for the past two years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: July 13, 2017 at 3:31 p.m. 
Dr. S. Allen Counter, a neuroscience professor and the founding director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, died Wednesday following a brief illness. He was 73.
Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Counter’s passing via email, writing, “many of us at Harvard College, including myself, felt personally Allen’s uncommon dignity and gentleness.”
At Harvard for over 45 years, Counter was a campus fixture. He worked alongside former University President Derek C. Bok to create the Harvard Foundation in 1981, an organization dedicated to advancing race relations on campus, and regularly welcomed foreign dignitaries, Nobel Peace Prize winners, and Hollywood actors to campus on behalf of the Foundation.
Hakeem O.I. Angulu ’20, an incoming Harvard Foundation intern, said Counter “was constantly thinking about making sure we were represented” and “provided for students of color ways to catch up and ways to feel comfortable and ways to showcase our culture.”
Former Treasurer of the United States Rosa “Rosie” Gumataotao Rios ’87, whom Counter called “one of [his] favorite people,” worked closely with him to launch Cultural Rhythms, an annual festival that features a variety of performing arts groups.
Rios, who has kept in touch with Counter since graduating, said Counter cultivated a spirit of inclusivity and the celebration of different cultures throughout his time at the University.
“Coming to Harvard was a unique experience. And coming as the daughter of Mexican immigrants was even more unique—not really coming across people who looked like me was daunting. He, along with President Bok, made me feel very very welcome,” Rios said in an interview with The Crimson.
“His tenacity is probably what I will remember most. When he is focused on an issue, he sees it through. Those are the types of champions that students need moving forward,” she said.
Counter’s legacy will be defined by his work in “breaking barriers,” Rios said. She cited his support for the Harvard Portraiture Project, which will hang her portrait in Winthrop House this fall—the first portrait of a Latina to be unveiled at Harvard—as an example of his defying tradition.
“Any time you set a course for what is normally the road not taken, that is always going to be a challenge. But he seems always to be successful at being able to break those barriers on behalf of the Harvard community.”
Anwar Omeish ’19, the Harvard Islamic Society’s Director of External Relations, has worked with Counter and the Harvard Foundation in planning several events and said their group saw him as “one of our best friends and staunchest allies.” Omeish said Counter never hesitated to express solidarity and offer support—even when politically unpopular to do so. He helped Muslim students secure a prayer space in Canaday Hall and organize an event on the one-year anniversary of the Chapel Hill shooting, among other initiatives.
“What struck me the most about him was the way that he very actively held space for students of colour on campus and defended that space,” she said.
Counter first came to Harvard as a postdoctoral fellow in a neurophysiology lab. His scientific research, along with a love of exploration, brought him to far-flung places—from studying acupuncture in China to researching lead exposure among villagers in the Andes.
Dubbed a “Renaissance man” in a 1998 Crimson article, Counter was a member of the Explorer’s Club of New York. On an expedition to Northwest Greenland in 1986, Counter found the half-Eskimo sons of North Pole discoverers Robert E. Peary and Matthew A. Henson.
Over the course of his life, Counter made active efforts to bring race to the forefront of the conversation. He successfully petitioned the U.S. government to move the remains of Henson, who was African-American, to Arlington National Cemetery, where Peary was interred. Counter also fought for U.S. Navy recognition of Henson’s achievements and was invited to sail on a Navy ship commissioned in Henson’s honor.
Angulu said Counter believed that everyone should have equal opportunity in life and worked tirelessly to realize the mission of the foundation to “enhance the quality of our common life.”
“He cared about making sure that we had spaces and people that were for us, and he was definitely one of those people and one of the makers of those spaces,” Angulu said.
Looking forward, Angulu said, “We will be working harder than ever to ensure that what Dr. Counter started continues to grow and continues to become what he envisioned Harvard to look like for people like us.”
Devontae A. Freeland ’19, a Harvard Foundation intern, said he appreciated what he described as Counter’s student-centered perspective and his ability to respond to the evolving challenges of “diversity and multiculturalism” at Harvard as the student demographic changed.
Counter was “someone who was pushing us to think outside of the bounds” of racial categories to focus on the many other ways they could “make life better at Harvard for everyone,” Freeland said.
Freeland emphasized that the Foundation will strive to continue Counter’s legacy. “We believe in institutional memory. There’s always a turnover... Even though Dr. Counter is no longer with us, the experiences and institutional knowledge will stay with us and the interns and staff will pass it on.”
The Black Students Association wrote in a statement, “We will take the lessons that Dr. Counter so gracefully provided us, and the University, over the past thirty years, to continue to carve out space for Black students here and now, and to pave the way for all Black Harvard students to come.”
“I will always remember not only the work that he did but the heart that he had. He has planted the seeds for many students,” Rios said.
