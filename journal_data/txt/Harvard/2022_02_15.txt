The queen of rap has returned. Following a three-year hiatus, Nicki Minaj released her single “Do We Have a Problem?” on Feb. 4. Minaj was joined by the prominent Atlanta rapper Lil Baby and Miami-native Papi Yerr, known primarily for his work with Tory Lanez.
Although fairly conventional, Papi Yerr’s production is undeniably catchy and made to top the charts. This head-bopping hit owes its appeal to its relative simplicity: a trap beat, heavy 808s on the downbeats, and a driving triplet synth melody. This formulaic approach is used in other Papi Yerr songs, notably “Bentayga,” showing that the production is nothing out of the ordinary.
The real magic of the single, however, comes with the impeccable flow of both Minaj and Lil Baby. From her opening lines “Tell ‘em my niña, my bitch, she a rider,” it is evident Minaj’s style has not been lacking as a result of her break. It’s as if she released her previous studio album “Queen” just yesterday, what with her verses resembling past works like “Chun-Li” and “Chun Swae.”
Furthermore, “Do We Have a Problem?” shows Minaj can truly thrive in any genre. Topping the charts in dance pop (“Starships”), drill (“Chi-raq”), and even K-Pop (“Idol”), her new single proves she is ready to take her place in the new wave of trap-heavy hip-hop, epitomized by rappers such as Lil Baby, Playboi Carti, and Lil Durk.
Despite his incredible flow, Lil Baby’s feature on the song falls short of spectacular. Partially because his verse only lasts 45 seconds, Minaj’s performance greatly outshines his. Regardless, he complements Minaj’s energy well, and the pair’s chemistry takes the song to another level.
We are not seeing the last of Minaj in “Do We Have a Problem?” Indeed, her next single, “Bussin,” is set to release on Feb. 11, again with a Lil Baby feature. Both songs are previews of her fifth studio album, “NM5,” which she is aiming to release this year.
Until then, Barbz can rejoice in Minaj’s two new singles and the queen’s return.

On his new mixtape “Me vs. Me,” NLE Choppa is back in full force. Much like the tape’s title suggests, Choppa can only be described as his own competition, because truly, no one else is doing it quite like him.
On Jan. 28, Choppa premiered his second commercial mixtape. While originally planning to drop the project on Jan. 21, Choppa delayed its release by a week after the death of fellow Memphis rapper and local legend Young Dolph. Rumor has it, however, that Choppa actually postponed his record because of a competing mixtape from “WUSYANAME” rapper NBA YoungBoy dropping the same day. Choppa and YoungBoy have been beefing for a while now, and on Jan. 17, Choppa even threw a punch at a particularly instigative YoungBoy fan in an airport. On “Me vs. Me,” perhaps in response to these troubles, or perhaps not, Choppa has harsh words for his enemies.
You might remember the viral single “Shotta Flow,” which debuted Choppa to the world back in 2019, at the wee age of 16. In that track, listeners were first exposed to Choppa’s most defining quality, his vivacious delivery. Over booming trap basses, sometimes thumping melodic instrumentals, Choppa supplied menacing bars with intense conviction. Back then, and still to this day, there exist few rappers that spit with such energy, conviction, and ferocity.
But even infectious delivery loses its staying power with enough repetition. As Aesop once said, it is definitely possible to have too much of a good thing. Choppa continues to deploy his signature aggressive delivery on this new project, which is good — it’s what drew fans to him in the first place. But he does so with buckshot precision, repeatedly, over the course of a bloated 53-minute project, until this formerly good thing becomes repetitive and uninteresting. It is here that the title “Me vs. Me” rings a little too true, because Choppa’s greatest strength ends up becoming a great weakness. In the three years he’s been on the scene, Choppa has yet to grow creatively.
First, consider the record’s opening track, “Shotta Flow 6.” No, you didn’t misread that. There are indeed five sequels to the first hit that made Choppa famous to begin with (six if you count the Blueface remix). Okay, yes, “Shotta Flow 6” is undeniably a thunderous trap feast, but it nevertheless sets a worrying tone for the album’s originality.
The album moves onto songs like “Trap Phone” and “Stompin,” which are prime examples of Choppa at his most uninspired. They’re dull, run-of-the-mill trap records, featuring monotonic melodies over generic beats. Even with the aggression, Choppa’s unremarkable bars quickly become background noise. The track “Final Warnings,” despite employing brutal descriptions of murder, suffers from a similar lack of ingenuity.
It’s here that the listener begins to realize Choppa really only has three flows, and on top of that, two delivery styles: aggressive shouting and aggressive sing-shouting. Throughout a 16-track project, this formula can get old pretty quickly.
But not even the formula is totally reliable. On “Too Hot,” Choppa’s one selling quality, his powerful delivery, is gone; he actually sounds bored on a song for the first time. Choppa’s presence unfortunately seems to have a chilling effect, as Moneybagg Yo also seems to be drowned in the stupor of it all.
Some features on this EP, however, do shine. On “Push It,” Choppa teams up with Young Thug to deliver a melodic trap banger. In addition to Thug’s reliable verse, the instrumental actually contains some chromatic variation. On “Chicago to Memphis,” G Herbo shows off vocals and lyrics that are genuinely menacing.
On “Change My Ways,” though, the singing takes a turn for the worse. Aggressive bars are followed by nasally singing that is far out of Choppa’s register, resulting in agonizing voice cracks. Songs like “Jumpin” are similarly sonic misses; the instrumental is stagnant and dissonant. Where the ear desperately craves any note progression in the flute riff, there is none.
“Ima Dogg” is hilarious, but not intentionally. The chorus reminds us, "I'm a dog," eight times, leaving you really wondering if he's a dog. Choppa interpolates both Gucci Mane and Famous Dex on this track. “Mmm Hmm,” however, sees Choppa go beyond just interpolation, perhaps leaning too heavily on the signature hums of Kid Cudi.
The best song on the album is also the shortest — this is stated without a hint of sarcasm. “I.Y.B.” is a mean trap banger, and at only a minute and a half long, it is just short enough that Choppa’s vices do not begin to beat the listener over the head. He’s at his best here when the formula is kept short and simple. Fat drums, A booming bassline, and a threatening Choppa delivering cold-blooded bars are all a fan really needs from one of his songs.
You may notice there was seldom a discussion of songs’ lyrical content. This is because one does not listen to NLE Choppa for witty wordplay or thought-provoking lyricism. Already well-known and well-documented (and perhaps also well-criticized) are the tropes of the gangsta rap genre. Choppa, conceptually, provides nothing new or particularly insightful to this style of music. It is the delivery, the beats, and the atmosphere that make audiences gravitate towards Choppa. On this album, there are many moments of that straight-talking trap brilliance, but the majority of tracks unfortunately blend into an unremarkable agglomeration of repetition and monotony.

“Casual Instagram” had officially gone too far once the President of the United States posted a photo dump.
The photo dump era was once intended to be a bold rejection of the highly curated, aesthetically pleasing Instagram feeds of today — nostalgically embracing the earlier days when people proudly snapped a picture of their homemade breakfast, slapped on a sepia filter, and called it a day.Now, the pressure to engage in casual Instagram comes with a certain level of theatrical performance. You don’t just have to try to look good anymore — scouring for the ideal pose and background. It’s all about capturing that perfect, fake off-guard picture or an aesthetic assortment of trash littered on Mass Ave. It’s a curated, un-curated look.
No app rejects this plastic notion more than BeReal, a new social media app developed in France by Alexis Barreyat in 2020 and now sweeping its way across college campuses in the United States. The mission is evident in their digital campaign, boldly asking: “What if social media could be different?”
The concept of the app is simple and, in the developers’ words, “uncontrollable.” A notification is sent out to all users at a random time each day, prompting them to take a photo of themselves and their surroundings within the next two minutes and upload it to the app. The time limit coupled with the sporadic timing of the notification forces users to, quite literally, be real. Because there’s no time to find that perfect pose or background, the content you engage with on the app is charmingly mundane yet extraordinarily authentic and creative.
BeReal is unlike all other social media apps popular today. There are no filters, likes, or followers: Just close friends who must request to follow you and the ability to comment and leave “RealMoji” reaction pictures below your friends’ posts. The app also recently added a feature to turn your friends’ RealMojis into widgets to keep on your home screen.
The app’s goal is not to amass thousands of followers or massive influence. In fact, their description on the iTunes App Store warns potential users, “if you want to become an influencer, you can stay on TikTok and Instagram.” Indeed, BeReal is a uniquely intimate social media experience that fosters true authenticity. While some people might be hesitant to share themselves sleep-deprived and hunched over a pset with thousands of vague acquaintances on Instagram, it’s much easier to share with your closest friends on BeReal.
Even if it’s after the allotted two minutes, you are unable to view other’s posts unless you upload your own, which makes lurking virtually impossible. You must be real to see real. Plus, since everyone posts once a day at the same time, you can’t really get sucked into scrolling mindlessly for hours.
After gaining immense popularity among French university students, BeReal is now taking American college campuses by storm — and Harvard is no exception. On Friday, Feb. 4, the app sponsored a party in the infamous Tasty burger basement and offered free admission to attendees that downloaded the app and added five friends. Be on the lookout for people stopping to BeReal in d-halls, during a meeting, or while online shopping in a lecture.
Perhaps photodumping a collection of contrived casualness isn’t the answer to achieving authenticity online. Bridging the glamour of social media and the mundane truth of real life, BeReal accomplishes what casual Instagrammers set out to do. Being real, at any time of the day — even if only for two minutes.
But this time, please no one tell Joe Biden.

Nothing nationalism quite like the Olympic Games. Viewers from around the globe watch the Olympics to experience the excitement of a historic tradition in which the world's greatest athletes gather to represent their countries on the world’s biggest stage. It’s momentous, it’s picturesque, and it sure is marketable: With viewership in the tens of millions, the biggest brands rush to outfit the athletes.
This year’s Opening Ceremony showcased brands ranging from USA’s Ralph Lauren to Nigeria’s Actively Black. But what exactly makes a team’s uniform “cool”? Is it the cohesion? Or a creative take? The best uniforms combine it all: trends, patriotism, creativity, and function. Here are our top five picks for Olympic uniforms from the Opening Ceremony.
5. TEAM SWITZERLAND 
The Swiss delegation looked imposing in a red and white look by Ochsner Sport. Simple but elegant, the brilliant white plays off of the vibrant red with the same intensity as the flag. The Swiss cross on the hat is subtly patriotic without appearing overpowering and complements the two-toned red jacket and pants. Their outfit is clean and simple, with sparkling white shoes that complete the understated, elegant look. Team Switzerland looks classy, cool, and cohesive in Beijing.
4. TEAM USA
Team USA is once again dressed in Ralph Lauren, and it’s a hit. The three different uniforms uniquely combine American patriotism and winter fashion. The blue shades of the flag bearers are a vintage ’70s dream made more cohesive by their high top boots. Not only does this threefold look set this brand apart, but their additional partnership with Skims screams a trendy collaboration that emphasizes American culture. This look is clean, sporty, and timeless — Ralph Lauren has done it again.
3. TEAM NIGERIA 
Nigeria only sent two athletes to this year’s Games, but their uniforms were stunning. Not only do those puffy pants look warm and cozy, but their uniforms beautifully connect functionality and culture. The carefully dyed headscarves nod to the traditional Nigerian head wrap, called a gele, while also keeping the athletes warm and dry. The luminous white of the rest of the uniform allows the draping to really shine and highlight the tie-dye pattern within. Designed and produced by a 15-month-old, Black-owned brand, Actively Black, this Opening Ceremony debut has blasted them into the spotlight. The future for this brand is bright!
2. TEAM GREAT BRITAIN
Team Great Britain’s uniforms, designed once more by Ben Sherman, are just stunning. They’re preppy and sleek, and the perfectly tailored trousers, cream-lined peacoat, and chic sweater really speak to Britain’s clean-cut fashion. It’s patriotic, but subtly and stylishly so. These outfits are simply timeless. The elegant black boots really tie it all together, crafting a cohesive look that is perfect for the Olympics or a day on the town. These uniforms are classic — great work, Ben.
1. TEAM CANADA 
Canada’s red monochrome look by Lululemon is an unequivocal fan favorite. It’s sporty and clean, but not too over the top — all of these pieces are chic on their own, but the way the slightly differing red shades play off of each other is mesmerizing and trendy. The entire uniform is almost completely made of down. The scarf, mittens, and down–coat–over–down–coat look keeps it interesting: It’s weird, but in a good way, and broken up by the monochrome shades. The subtle “Canada” on the scarf and mittens is a nod to patriotism without overtaking the whole look. These outfits are the best combination of creative, patriotic, and trendy: Wear these coats over some black leggings and Docs and people will be dying to know where they’re from.

Nearly thirty years after Matthew McConaughey’s breakout film “Dazed and Confused,” in which McConaughey plays a Texas stoner who refuses to move beyond his high school years, the actor has transformed into a household name.
His first line in the film — “Alright, alright, alright” — has since appeared everywhere from Target mugs to the Oscars. With his Southern drawl and rakish good looks, McConaughey soon became synonymous with the early-2000s image of chill. Yet now, McConaughey’s relaxed and repeated truisms regarding society’s need to “just keep livin” begin to read irresponsibly while he navigates the murky waters of American politics. As Covid-19 rages on, how do fans reconcile the actor’s laid-back persona with his refusal to vaccinate two of his three children?
McConauaghey’s image as an actor has proven itself shockingly dynamic. For the first fifteen years of his career, he starred primarily in unexceptional romantic comedies opposite a wide range of successful actresses, including Jennifer Lopez and Kate Hudson. Despite his solid position in Hollywood as a B-movie lead, McConaughey challenged the film industry’s capitulation of him by playing a demanding role in “Dallas Buyers Club” (2013). To effectively portray AIDS patient Ron Woodruff, McConaughey lost fifty pounds for the film, eventually winning an Academy Award for his performance. Thus began the “McConaissance”: a period of five years in which Matthew McConaughey pivoted away from his image as a rom-com actor through more probing and profound roles. His noteworthy switch to television for Nic Pizzolatto’s “True Detective” (2014) stunned critics and fans alike, firmly cementing him as a dramatic force to be reckoned with and garnering the movie star an Emmy nomination.
Later on, however, McConaughey’s serious roles began to dwindle as he took on projects outside of acting. After serving as a visiting (and often absent) instructor at UT Austin, the actor wrote his memoir to both wide acclaim and ridicule in 2020. “Greenlights” contained everything people find half-charming and half-absurd about the actor, including meaningless lines like, “Sometimes you have etc., sometimes etc. has you.” Though it debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list, one wonders whether McConaughey’s audience laughs with him or at him. Through “Greenlights,” McConaughey reinhabits his previous goofy archetype, only now as an Academy Award winner with earnest political aspirations.
McConaughey does not keep his personal life close to the vest, often divulging information like the state of his parents’ sex life in televised interviews. Consequently, his deflecting questions regarding a potential candidacy in the Texas gubernatorial election drew concern. McConaughey’s positive polling against current Texas Governor Greg Abbott introduced a potential dilemma for the Democratic Party. While established candidate Beto O’Rourke’s polling remained low when set against Abbott, McConaughey maintained a nine point lead. In an effort to unseat the Republican governor, especially after his support of restrictive state-wide abortion laws, Democrats may have been more inclined to support McConaughey over O’Rourke.
Despite his inexperience and refusal to claim a political party, McConaughey’s voter popularity and opposition to Abbott’s administration presented a clear benefit for Democrats. But how could party leadership seriously consider supporting a gubernatorial candidate who has written about masturbating in the tub to the poetry of Lord Byron? Recently, McConaughey announced that he will not be running in the upcoming election, though he pointedly did not rule out future political candidacy. Once again, the public is forced to reconsider the role of Matthew McConaughey in American cultural mythology.
It is easy to laugh at the caricature of McConaughey. While his acting chops are formidable, his happy-go-lucky attitude and general nonchalance have made him into something of a mascot for the clueless, wealthy celebrity. And though some find his laissez-faire lifestyle appealing to watch from afar, it is reasonable to doubt its translation to political office. The “Greenlights” author’s early refusal to vaccinate two of his children against Covid-19 is a “red light” for numerous voters. After the vaccine was approved by the CDC for children from ages five through eleven, McConaughey stated, “I still want to find out more information, but I couldn’t mandate for kids just yet, no.”
Certainly, as one of the most famous people in the United States, his anti-vaccination rhetoric is problematic. The image of a parent justifying their decision not to vaccinate their child with a Matthew McConaughey interview in hand is not a happy one, although the practical level of danger attached to his words might seem minimal.
As a potential political candidate, however, McConaughey’s lighthearted advice to “just keep livin” doesn’t feel serious enough. For starters, there’s no L-I-V-I-N’ without V-A-C-C-I-N-A-T-I-O-N.
Moreover, after the Texas winter storm demonstrated the lack of infrastructural safety nets in place for climate emergencies, Texans are looking for new leaders. In September, a poll by the Texas Politics Project showed Governor Greg Abbott polling with only a 41% approval rating, the lowest he’s seen yet. Can McConaughey, with no previous political experience, tackle problems like abortion and climate change with the gravity they deserve? His investment in sports teams and pickles during what he labeled a consequential period of consideration regarding the gubernatorial election suggests otherwise.
He may be a good candidate for his state in terms of polling, but he still needs to prove that he would be a good politician. A new McConaissance must take place — McConaughey needs to become serious about policy, stating clearly his opinions concerning hot button issues like voting rights and critical race theory. He must demonstrate that he understands the weight of his words considering the wide reach of his platform. Lastly, to run successfully, he needs to align himself more obviously with a political party. Matthew McConaughey has rehabilitated his image before, winning the approval of the Academy and many more through performances in “Dallas Buyers Club” and “True Detective.” Is he willing to do it again?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This article contains mentions of sexual assault that may be troubling to some readers.
“I will show Your Illustrious Lordship what a woman can do.” These words, spoken by the Italian Baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, embody the dauntless spirit of one of the Renaissance’s most famous painters.
When I first learned of the story of Artemisia Gentileschi, I was immediately captivated by what seemed like an empowering feminist tale. A gifted young painter growing up in the birthplace of the Renaissance, Gentileschi began her life studying under her father Orazio in Florence. Her world was torn apart, however, when another one of her father’s artists, Agostino Tassi, sexually assaulted her. Orazio and Artemisia sued the man in Florentine court, and, thanks to misogynistic laws concerning a woman’s virginity, they won the case. Florence was so taken with the scandal that Artemisia Gentileschi was propelled into artistic stardom, and her artworks, depicting feminist retellings on biblical stories, became wildly popular.
While this dramatic retelling sounds like the plot of a popular new period drama or award-winning YA novel, it was her life: The repercussions of Tassi’s act both limited and enriched her artistic career and aspirations. Yet the truth is more complicated than our initial impressions.
Gentileschi’s artistic journey began when she was just a child, when her father noticed her promise. By her teenage years, she was reproducing works of great technique, artistry, and emotion, and her style embodied the essence of the Baroque artistic tradition — biblical themes with elaborate anatomical forms, theatrical use of light and shadow, and meticulous attention to detail that imparted a sense of drama and realism. Her art was already beginning to be infused with a distinctly feminist pathos that set her artworks apart from her inspirations, such as Caravaggio and her own father Orazio.
image id=1354201align=center size=large caption=true
“Susanna and Elders” is one such work, painted by Gentileschi at the age of 17. While other works of the time danced around the perverted details of the story, with Susanna blissfully unaware of the creepy old men lurking near, Gentileschi’s depiction brings this harsh conflict to light. A frightened Susanna twists away from the men in clear distress as they leer over her, attempting to coerce her into sex. Susanna’s form is painted with detail and naturalism that reflects Gentileschi’s own skill and focus on rendering the body accurately, and the vibrant colors and shadows practically leap off of the canvas. The work is a triumph of Baroque art and an early example of Gentileschi’s skill in communicating feminist themes to the viewers clearly and powerfully.
After her tragic rape and highly publicized trial, Gentileschi married and set up her own personal studio in Florence, which gave her the freedom to create the art she wanted. Her work often featured scenes of strong and empowered women taking down tyrannical male villains, and were laden with double meanings in the context of her own trauma.
image id=1354202 align=center size=large caption=true
Take “Judith Slaying Holofernes” as a prime example. One of her most famous and celebrated works, this painting depicts the story of the Israelite woman Judith bravely seducing and then beheading the Assyrian general Holofernes. Previous examples of this popular biblical image, such as Caravaggio’s own painting of the scene, depict a feminine and timid Judith with a passive maidservant, daintily holding the general’s neck, the brutal act she is taking part in barely registering on her face. Gentileschi’s painting, by contrast, shows a muscular and powerful Judith, straining against the writhing figure of Holofernes as she plunges a bloody dagger into his neck. Her maidservant actively helps with the strenuous feat that emphasizes the bond of womanhood and the triumph of the female heroine over a male antagonist.
Art historians have offered a surface-level interpretation based on the contextual information we know of Gentileschi’s “Judith Slaying Holofernes” is a revenge painting, plain and simple. Gentileschi is expressing her rage and pain through the medium of art, and Judith is a semi-autobiographical figure, slaying the man that has terrorized her people as Gentileschi may have wished to do to her abuser. Indeed, many of Gentileschi’s women were painted in her image, and these works certainly echo this feminist sentiment of taking back the power and standing up to the oppressor.
But Gentileschi was more clever than many historians give her credit for. As a self-made, self-supporting artist, she needed to fight hard, and well, to survive in a male-dominated world. Gentileschi knew that her story was appealing — or at least interesting — to the wealthy patrons of Florence who would be lining her pockets with commissions. In a stroke of cunning genius, she infused her works with strong feminist undertones, crafting the narrative for herself as a bold female painter. “Judith Slaying Holofernes” is a superb example of this common theme that would play out throughout all of her works, building upon her narrative as an empowered woman seeking to express the anger of her injustice through her art and fulfilling the demands of a market of eager patrons.
Gentileschi was truly one of the finest artists of the Renaissance, and by reducing her story to that of just a “feminist” painter, audiences fail to appreciate her full-fledged artistic talents. Her paintings are a hallmark of feminist art, but Gentileschi deserves to be known for more than her story. Her prolific works also display a sensitivity to the human form, light, and color, and she explores the various biblical themes with skill, subtlety, and nuance. Her art was prized among collectors because of the rarity of her status as a female artist, the compelling story behind her works, and her considerable artistic prowess. It is all of these aspects together that reveal the true narrative of Gentileschi’s life.
image id=1354203 align=center size=large caption=true
The final painting I wish to bring attention to is “Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting.” The painting’s central figure contains aspects of the Allegory of Paint herself, yet it is also self-referential, resembling Gentileschi’s form poised in the art of her craft. This painting is incredibly sophisticated, showcasing her skill through the artwork’s technical virtuosity and emphasizing both Gentileschi’s own dual identity as a woman and artist, thus immortalizing her in the act of creation.
It is exceedingly important to recognize such brilliant women artists in our world. Art is the most powerful tool of expression throughout human history, and by looking at the stories of these talented and creative women, we celebrate the persistence of the female spirit. Gentileschi’s tale is an inspiration to us all, and her courage, cleverness, and creativity have paved the way for the women artists and visionaries of the modern world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There were six radio presets and six CD slots in the 2007 Honda Pilot that I drove in high school. I was a master at flipping from FM to CD and could replace a disc in seconds. Wherever I was in town, I knew exactly which CD and track to switch to so that the song ended as I pulled into my driveway.
Even though my radio scanning prowess was off the charts, I often reverted back to Disc 4, Track 3: “Laundry Room” from the Avett Brothers’ “Live Vol. Four.” It was the ultimate song to drive home to, perfect for singing along in harmony and pounding the dashboard like a bass drum as the finale crescendoed. The way that the last chord so effortlessly transitioned into the next track is what cemented this album as my go-to.
It was around this time when I started getting “into” music — listening to it anyway. I had just discovered Spotify and was building my music library quickly. My love for the Avett Brothers began then, but scouring their discography, I was surprised by how different their songs sounded in live recording compared to studio ones — and how much better I liked the live versions.
“Live Vol. Four” led me to the remaining three volumes and a laundry list of live performances on YouTube. There was no turning back from the thrall of YouTube series like Tiny Desk, COLORS studio, Paste Magazine, and Cardinal Sessions. The list of musicians I wanted to see perform in concert grew and grew.
The closest venues were in Austin, TX, an hour away from my hometown. I would make the trip whenever I could and dream of living in the city so I could see concerts every week. Even though I only went to the concerts of my favorite bands, the best part was always hearing the openers. Before every concert, I would try to listen to a couple of songs in preparation, but it was always the live performance that unlocked the soul of the music.
“The Oh Hellos” opened my first ever concert. I remember one of the band members climbed the stage scaffolding so that he could play from a nearby tree limb. The energy there simply couldn’t be matched through headphones. The following year I watched them headline a show in the same venue and fell in love with their openers, “The Marmalakes.” Another year later, I saw them perform at Austin’s famous Blues on the Green concert series. After seeing them in person, streaming their songs only served to bring back the memory of their performance.
The way I listen, discover, and appreciate music wholly changed once I began regularly attending live concerts. When you share a room with an artist, watching them make music out of nothing, feeling the beat in your heart, singing out to add your voice to the song, lifting your hands to the sky, and dancing with hundreds of fans doing the same — it’s ceremonial. Listening to music thereafter doesn’t bring joy just because of the song but because you remember experiencing it.
People tend to claim music as their own. We make our playlists, build our song libraries, pay our streaming subscriptions, and post our Spotify Wrapped and Replays. When it comes to listening to music, we keep it digitized. Live music, however, can’t be digitized. So we usually don’t engage. We wait around for a Spotify notification or Instagram ad to tell us the band we follow is coming to town. Otherwise we save up for the next big ticket music festival, maybe for the music and variety, but for the perfect social media post too. All the while, music is constantly performed in venues big and small across the country every night of the week.
Just last week, The Weeknd, YOLA, Still Woozy, Francis Dillon, and Remi Wolf came to Boston. This week? Pinegrove, Two Friends, Dua Lipa. Not to mention 30 or more artists to discover…just this week. Live music is alive and well and happening in Boston as we speak. It’s moving and inspiring audiences every single night. Whether in a crowded bar room, outdoor amphitheater, or rock club, let’s go find it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As any Letterboxd loyalist will tell you, there are few things as telling as someone’s top four films. These selections can make or break a friendship. Seriously, do you really want to get to know a person who has “The Emoji Movie” in their top four?
I will now unabashedly profess my Letterboxd top four to the world. If you find yourself in strong agreement with my selections, I congratulate you for having immaculate taste in film. And if you find yourself deeply offended, please keep any and all complaints to yourself, as I am very fragile.
1. “La La Land” — dir. Damien Chazelle 
There is no film more sublime than Damien Chazelle ’07’s 2016 masterpiece “La La Land.” Beginning with one of film’s most artfully choreographed opening numbers, this movie lets viewers know that they are about to witness a pure old Hollywood spectacle. The bright costumes, sprawling Los Angeles scenery, and picturesque cinematography all make this modern love story a pleasure to watch. The iconic dancing among the stars at the Griffith Observatory will forever be one of my favorite moments in cinema, a whimsical blend of story and artistry.
As for the acting, Emma Stone is superb as Mia, a struggling actress trying to achieve her dream while pursuing a relationship with the equally ambitious Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Stone plays her role in the couple’s star-crossed tale with extremely nuanced and genuine emotions, most notably in her Oscar-securing audition scene near the film’s close. Mia and Sebastian’s longing expressions in the film’s final montage, which brutally details the joyous life the two could have led, sets this complex love story apart within an often cliché genre.
It would be remiss not to include praise for the film’s soundtrack by Justin Hurwitz ’08. Rarely do I find myself going back to listen to a movie’s score and soundtrack, but “La La Land” is the wonderful exception. Gems such as “Someone in the Crowd” and “Mia and Sebastian’s Theme” will assure viewers that this work is not only a cinematic achievement, but a musical one as well.
Plus, Damain Chazelle is a 2007 graduate of Harvard College. Show some school spirit and watch.
2. “Toy Story 3” — dir. John Lasseter
Although my love for this film is mainly rooted in feelings of nostalgia, that is not to say it is lacking in any aspect. Easily the most emotionally rich film in the “Toy Story” franchise, the story follows Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of the gang as they try to grapple with Andy’s departure for college and their ensuing feelings of worthlessness. The film is Pixar’s finest tear-jerker. The final scene when Andy gives his toys away to bring happiness to another child is both soul-crushing and hopeful, a potent mix that transcends any gripes about this being just another “kids’ movie.”
Beyond its emotional heft, the animation in this film is gorgeous. One scene that stands out in particular is the introduction of Andy’s toys to Sunnyside Daycare, which is accompanied by an eye-catching, multi-color spectacle of all kinds of new toys. And the plot contains one of cinema’s most shocking twists to date. No first time viewer can claim to have predicted that Lots-o’-Huggin Bear, the jolly old leader of Sunnyside, is secretly a diabolical mastermind with no intention of letting the toys leave. It is no mistake that “Toy Story 3” is only one of three animated films to have ever been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.
3. “The Big Short” — dir. Adam McKay
Ever since seeing this movie at far too young an age, I have been infatuated with the work of Adam McKay. A brilliant satirist best known for films such as “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,” and “Step Brothers,” McKay’s foray into the world of historical films is equal parts disturbing, informative, and funny.
With a stacked cast including Christian Bale, Brad Pitt, Ryan Gosling, and Steve Carell — who delivers his best dramatic performance ever — McKay’s film allows no room for boredom. The impeccable acting is paired with razor-sharp dialogue, surprising editing choices which intersperse various images to reinforce the film’s meaning, and memorable celebrity cameos.
“The Big Short” challenges traditional modes of storytelling and satire at every turn, making it an entirely singular experience that will leave viewers satisfied, yet unsettled. Skip McKay’s newest Netflix film “Don’t Look Up” and opt for this much more clever satire instead.
4. “The Father” — dir. Florian Zeller
Coming in at number four is the most obscure film of the bunch, Florian Zeller’s 2020 triumph “The Father,” which is based on a play of the same name. While this film seems at first glance to be nothing more than a predictable, sad tale of a man with dementia, viewers will quickly learn that this is not the case.
The film recounts the daily happenings in a London flat through the eyes of Anthony Hopkins, who plays the titular father battling memory loss. As such, it is almost impossible for viewers to discern between reality and delusion for the entirety of this tragedy, which is disguised as a sort of psychological thriller. The result is a film which leaves viewers with more questions than answers, a frustrating feeling that poignantly mimics only a fraction of the pain Hopkins’ character must be enduring. And as always, Olivia Colman is fantastic.
More than anything, this movie — particularly its concluding scene, in which Hopkins undoubtedly cements his status as the actor of a generation — will linger with viewers long after it ends. Whether or not those watching have a personal connection to someone with dementia, this film will enhance viewers’ compassion and understanding of the disease, a true testament to the power of films.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Jennifer Egan’s “The Candy House” tells the story of tech tycoon Bix Bouton and his most revolutionary innovation, “Own Your Unconscious,” which allows one to access every memory they’ve ever had. More than just a cautionary tale about the impact of advancing technology, “The Candy House” is an examination of humanity’s desire for connection, love, and family. An intellectually dazzling puzzle, “The Candy House” is a worthy successor to Egan’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel,“A Visit from the Goon Squad.”
The novel jumps through several decades and multiple families, taking the reader through all of the events leading up to and after the creation of “Own Your Unconscious.” Tying together the cultural revolution of the 1960s to cultural turmoil in the 2020s and 2030s, Egan creates a sense of the repetition of history. She skillfully explores a wide variety of narrative styles, not just switching between narrative perspectives, but also structuring chapters in ways as diverse as a series of emails or a set of instructions in the second person. The interlocking stories show how complex humanity’s relationship with technology can really be. Egan’s message shines through in this storytelling format, contrasting human connection with the background of technological innovation.
Egan uses the destruction of familial relationships to portray the unsavory role technology can play. “Own Your Unconscious” is painted in a decidedly negative light as it creates ideological rifts between father and son and drives a mother to the extremes of paranoia. “The Candy House” is a critique not only of rapidly changing technology, but also of the culture that inevitably arises as we get accustomed to technology’s advancements.
A lack of privacy and data monetization as well as authenticity are key themes explored in “The Candy House.” In much the same way that companies harvest data about us from Google searches or Netflix streams, Egan’s “counters” gather information about people’s personalities and feelings through surveillance. The creation of this profession represents how capitalistic greed can invade neutral technology — along with people’s privacy — and monetize it, expertly mirroring the world we live in today. The search for authenticity is depicted with references to “word casings,” or over-used words that have lost their meaning, and the hunt for “the thing itself.”
The variety of narrative styles and narrating characters in “The Candy House” leaves the reader curious and maybe even a little disoriented at the start of every chapter. The uncertainty as to which character will appear next, and how they will fit into Egan’s world, is enthralling. As the book progresses, Egan masterfully unfolds the details to orient the reader, and the puzzle quickly starts to come together.
Overall, “The Candy House” is a sensational novel that depicts the human struggle to find your place in a technologically evolving world. With intricately written prose and nuanced characters, “The Candy House” is an exhilarating and enjoyable read.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“They just set us back 10 years.”
This would be an appropriate response to when Kanye West said slavery was “a choice” or when watching Christian Walker on TikTok. This is a phrase some Black folks use when we feel someone has embarrassed or humiliated the Black community. It may also be used in more casual situations, like if a Black person dances poorly in public or makes a joke that doesn’t land.
In their actions, all the progress Black people have made over the years, cleaning up our reputation, was lost. I have often used this phrase jokingly, but in light of recent news I have realized the weight it holds.
This month, three graduate students filed a lawsuit against Harvard for ignoring reported sexual assault claims about Professor John L. Comaroff over multiple years, including both physical and verbal harassment. He was put on paid administrative leave back in 2020, and more recently was placed on unpaid leave and can no longer advise any new graduate students. Shortly before the students’ lawsuit, 38 Harvard faculty members voiced their support of Comaroff in an open letter, challenging the University’s sanctions.
Many of these faculty signatories were Black professors, some hailing from the African and African American Studies Department. Seeing names of Black professors in support of Comaroff brought me no other emotions but disgust and shame. But my conclusions regarding this situation were much more complex.
Due to lack of representation, each of our individual actions are broadcasted to the rest of the greater Harvard community. Every action we do, every move we make, represents the Black community. Despite our minority status, I appreciate that we have created strong Black spaces and claimed Black professors as our mentors in order to preserve as much of our culture and seek comfort as much we can. Whenever I walk through the Harvard campus and see other Black faculty or students we always give each other a nod of solidarity or a smile, knowing the experience we share.
However, I assumed that all of us on campus share most of the same morals and ideals — but obviously I was wrong.
Sexual assault is a very serious problem on college campuses but I have always felt very safe in Black spaces. The Black professors who signed that open letter broke that safe space. I cannot imagine what it felt like for Black students to lose their mentor or their role model. To see Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Jamaica Kincaid on that list was painful to many, regardless if one was taught by them or not.
The white students who saw their favorite white mentors or professors on this list have a multitude of others to choose from. For many of these students, their first thought probably wasn’t “they just set us back 10 years” or even considered that the professor was white. It was just some professor that did something wrong.
These high expectations we have to meet to satisfy our own community — but also not to disappoint others — is unfair. I should not be afraid to make a mistake due to the impact it might have on the Black community. I should not have to worry about the secondhand embarrassment or shame from my peers’ mistakes. This monolith is dangerous and toxic and needs to be discarded.
Yet, I also am not condoning the actions of the professors that supported Comaroff in the midst of his multiple sexual assault allegations. I am not giving Black people a free pass to commit horrific acts. Letting go of the idea that Black people are a monolith is not meant to shelter wrongdoers, but hopefully to help Black students realize the unfortunate reality that we cannot always rely on each other simply on the basis of race.
Seventy-three professors condemned their colleagues and supported the women who were brave enough to speak out against Comaroff. Black professors were also represented on this list; it’s refreshing to see that exemplary leaders and role models still exist for Black students at Harvard.
Most professors later revoked their support of Comaroff, including both Gates and Kincaid. This seems ingenuine and reactionary, however, and we should still condemn these professors for originally supporting Comaroff. Neither group represents the entirety of the Black community; we should not feel like Camroff’s supporters tainted our name nor should we feel like his critics were our saving grace.
Black people deserve the autonomy to represent themselves. In efforts to protect my peers from the pain and shame like this again, we need to be cognizant of the drawbacks of the Black monolith.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another day, another snowstorm, another Harvard sexual misconduct scandal. Except this time around, the accused — John L. Comaroff, Professor of Anthropology and African and African-American Studies — has found himself surrounded by unlikely allies, prominent faculty members hailing from across Harvard schools. A diverse group of Pulitzer Prize winners, New Yorker staff writers, and public intellectuals who chose to close ranks.
Comaroff had been on paid administrative leave since August 2020, following disturbing allegations that he had harassed several university students. This January, over a year and a half after the news of the allegations broke, Comaroff was placed on unpaid leave by Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, and barred from teaching required courses or taking on new advisees in the upcoming academic year.
The ensuing faculty revolt proved faster than the University investigation itself. Barely two weeks after Gay announced the sanctions, 38 of the University’s most eminent faculty members penned a letter questioning the process and personally vouching for Comaroff’s character. In doing so, they endorsed an account rooted almost exclusively on a press release authored by Comaroff’s lawyers, one in which he had been cleared of most allegations and punished exclusively for warning a graduate student of the risk of suffering gender-based violence if she traveled to certain parts of Africa as an openly BGLTQ woman. “Perplexed” by their narrow version of events, they expressed “dismay” at the sanctions, “concerned” over the professional criteria that led to the decision.
Suffice to say, our esteemed Harvard academics, professional thinkers, failed to critically engage with the source of this description — the accused’s lawyer! — and its inherent bias. They refused to acknowledge the bizarre racial politics of offering, unprompted, descriptions of sexual violence at the mention of Africa. Crucially, they also failed to fully acknowledge other sources, even while citing them in the letter: They failed to mention a more graphic description of events publicly available in the Chronicle of Higher Education. According to the Chronicle’s reporting, the student alleged Comaroff used the phrase “would be raped” (a detail Comaroff’s lawyers deny and the signers obviate). Comaroff, the student alleges, started musing about scenarios and places where she would suffer sexual violence, and did so in a bizarre tone, “a tone you would use if you were talking about a movie you liked”.
Taken at its best, the letter’s uncritical engagement with limited perspectives, voiced in such decisive and unambiguous terms, was hasty and uninformed. At its worst, we worry that it reflects a terrifying, deep rot: a faculty more concerned with jealously guarding their power, discouraging scrutiny, and protecting their professional buddies, than with the wellbeing and safety of the student body.
Academia, on this campus and beyond, has no shortage of problems when it comes to pupil-professor dynamics. Huge age disparities, overemphasized credentials, and institutional clout create power differentials between students and their instructors. The so-called “star system,” which gives a handful of eminences the power to make or break careers, entrenches this asymmetry, impelling the ambitious to find and curry favor with the powerful. Female students in male-dominated departments stand to suffer most from this dependency, forced to contend with anything from exclusion by the old boys’ club to real, physical danger.
The well-documented, informal norms that lead American police officers to shield their colleagues from accountability have been dubbed a “blue wall of silence.” As we look at this ill-informed open letter, signed by 38 tenured faculty members, among them some of Harvard’s brightest stars, it is impossible for us not to worry that this power asymmetry continues because members of our faculty have erected their own wall of silence within our Cambridge campus.
In the long shadow of that wall, it can only grow harder for victims to come forward with their stories. Shielded from transparency or accountability, faculty-student power imbalances will continue to cause concrete harm.
We thus reaffirm our belief (rooted in a different, also disturbingly mishandled, set of accusations) that sexual misconduct should be grounds for revoking tenure. Though this open letter was an exceedingly poor way to raise doubts, we encourage the University to better educate faculty on Title IX policies and clarify any ambiguities that may remain. It does not escape us, however, that faculty entrusted to mentor and advise students should be able to tell the difference between what is and isn’t appropriate in their relationship with advisees.
By openly expressing support for Comaroff, 38 of our best-known affiliates failed their basic duty to take proper care of the students they are entrusted with. In a letter premature and distant from every source but Comaroff’s lawyer, the 38 signed away their credibility, indicating an unforgivable lack of judgment when handling sensitive, painful accusations. In one stroke, they sanitized and disseminated a challenged version linked to the accused, and diminished their credibility so as to make any future missive featuring their names less powerful.
Now — amid a fresh lawsuit filed with unsettling details, and a second letter, critical of the first — all but three of the 38 faculty members have issued a public retraction. Yet the rash signatories will have to live with the reality that, when push came to shove, with the most limited, slanted information, they sided with their colleague over his accusers. A quick retraction will not change that.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Tryna prove a point to my parents; like this post if you or one of your close friends at harv are currently depressed.”
The post, slabbed across the top of the Harvard Confessions Facebook page, had no name attached to it, no comments, no shares. But it did have 132 likes.
A flurry of related posts on this very same page has added thunder – and context – to this storm of 132 pixelated thumbs. One student documented a semester replete with bouts of depression that became aggravated by an unmoved Teaching Fellow. Another detailed a failed search for help within bureaucratic confines: Having met with Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Services, two peer counseling groups, and their resident dean, the student wrote, “I can’t believe how all of them felt like talking to a brick wall, and how little true support Harvard has to offer.”
The construction of these stony brick divides is in fact paradigmatic of student mental health advocacy at Harvard. Even when administrators promise progress, problems tend to persist – only to pile added weight onto the towering, seemingly impenetrable walls which divide us.
Surprisingly, it’s the pre-Covid data compiled by administrative leaders on the other side of that wall – Harvard’s very own Report of the Task Force on Managing Student Mental Health – that casts the darkest of shadows upon this discolored brushwork of online whispers. Published in July 2020, the report demystifies the stressors that cut across all corners of the University – from overburdened undergraduate classrooms, to hypercompetitive clubs, to overflowing lines of students waiting for an appointment at CAMHS, where professional help is a scarce resource in high (and increasing) demand. The report’s hard metrics unearth the virulent spread of this campuswide epidemic – nearly one-third of surveyed undergraduates thought they may be depressed; 62 percent felt isolated, withdrawn, or just flat out lonely; and 6 percent reported having seriously considered suicide.
On the surface, these two sources of student divulgences couldn’t be more different from one another. One, a constellation of anonymized disclosures fueled by frenzied fingers on pocket-sized screens. The other, a careful study collected by key stakeholders across Harvard. And yet, beneath their outer surfaces, both the frenzied posts and the empirical data tell the same story: one of dejected students entrenched in a pressure-cooker culture, further scorched by broken systems of support.
Upon its release, the task force’s nuanced depiction of the Harvard student experience – one which so neatly mirrored students’ candid, anonymized lamentations – seemed to be a remarkable act of listening, an informal commitment to start chipping away at the tall administrative divide which has taken decades to construct.
I managed to lock in a Zoom call on Friday with two of the most powerful players entrusted with executing the report’s recommendations: Dr. Giang T. Nguyen, the Executive Director of Harvard University Health Services, and Robin T. Glover, Harvard’s Associate Provost for Student Affairs.
The story that unfolded is a complicated one; one which I find difficult to make sense of regardless of how many hours I spend leafing through my scribbly, dotted interview notes. But one thing is clear: 19 months later, the Implementation Committee charged with enacting the report’s recommendations has made surprisingly little headway.
Technically, as Nguyen and Glover made clear, a myriad of the task force’s recommendations had been heeded – but they were low-hanging fruits with little juice to bear. Largely dried out by soft calls for further inquiry, these recommendations not only enable, but practically beg for, inaction.
Key among these was the directive to assemble a team that would “explore” accessibility at CAMHS.
“That's a work in process,” Nguyen said of the team’s work. “So, we don't have any solutions from that yet, but we have folks who are working very hard to address that.”
In other words: the team has been formed, but its impact has been nil.
Also within the list of recommendations was counsel that a team be built to launch a one-year mental health awareness campaign. Back in March 2021, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 told The Crimson that the Provost’s Office was “working out” how to implement this recommendation. Nearly a year later, working groups are still, well, working.
“A current working group that we have is to look at resources and training for our faculty to address things about dealing with students with distress,” Glover said.
The most dispiriting fact here is that this slowness of action sucks power from the urgency embedded within the task force’s unsettling collection of findings – a “crisis” unfolded, to use the report’s own language, through its candid mosaic of hard numbers and soft-spoken words. This fiery crisis is still alive, but as it blazes through Harvard’s gates, not all hands are on deck to diffuse it.
“The implementation of the task force recommendations is just starting at this point because there were a lot of other things that we had to really focus our energy on in terms of responding to the pandemic,” Nguyen told me. “But also, some things just take time.”
Perhaps some things do take time. But when they’re made a priority, they nonetheless manage to get done.
Maybe this really is a story of competing priorities – as Nguyen hinted, it was particularly ill-fated that this report came out only four months after a raging pandemic ravaged the world. Or perhaps this is just another case of the Harvard administration’s notorious tendency to overpromise and underdeliver. Maybe it’s a bitter mix of both.
The week after next, this column will evaluate Harvard’s visions for new mental health enactments. And when the Implementation Committee actually starts implementing, I’ll report on their continued progress, too.
The clock is ticking, though – not least because I’m set to graduate in less than 19 months.

UPDATED: February 15, 2022 at 12:43 a.m.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will speak at Harvard’s 369th Commencement ceremony this spring.
Ardern is set to address Harvard’s Class of 2022 at the first of two Commencement ceremonies the school will hold in May. She will speak to graduates on May 26 — three days before the school will hold a second ceremony for the Classes of 2020 and 2021, which graduated online due to the pandemic.
The University confirmed that Ardern will speak on Monday after Stuff, the largest news website in New Zealand, first reported the pick on Sunday.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow lauded Ardern in a press release Monday.
“From climate change and gender equality to COVID-19, she has modeled compassionate leadership that has brought together empathy and science-based solutions to address the most challenging issues of our time,” he said. “I very much look forward to her address.”
The speaker for the May 29 ceremony has not yet been announced.
Ardern announced earlier this month she would travel to the United States to lead a trade delegation in the spring.
Ardern became leader of the New Zealand Labour Party in August 2017. Two months later, at age 37, she became the country’s youngest prime minister in more than a century.
Outside of New Zealand, Ardern has received numerous honors: She has been named to Fortune’s 2021 World’s 50 Greatest Leaders list, Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People list twice, and Forbes Magazine’s list of most powerful women repeatedly.
When she takes the podium in Harvard’s Tercentenary Theater in May, Ardern will be the first in-person Commencement speaker in two years. She will be the 17th sitting world leader to deliver a Harvard Commencement address. Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel served as the school’s last in-person Commencement speaker in 2019.
Last year, Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, spoke during the virtual ceremony. Simmons, who led Brown University from 2001 to 2012, was the first Black president of an Ivy League institution. Former Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron spoke at the University’s 2020 virtual ceremony.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two paper signs bearing racist slurs were posted on the door of Undergraduate Council President Michael Y. Cheng ’22 on Monday morning, sparking condemnation from Quincy House faculty and students.
Cheng said he first became aware of the flyers — which called him an anti-Asian slur and included the phrase “SAVE THE UC” — when he left his dorm in Quincy House on Monday morning. Another Quincy resident reported the flyers to House administrators shortly after, according to Cheng.
Cheng called the act disheartening but “not that surprising” and linked the incident to previous criticism of his political platform.
“It’s disappointing that I feel desensitized to all this noise, even though this is just objectively racist,” he said.
“It’s right after the UC midterm elections," Cheng added. "There are some people that are frustrated by decisions we’ve made."
Cheng was elected UC president in November after pledging during his campaign to “defund” the body and rewrite its constitution. His inauguration was marred by hostility between his administration and other general members of the UC.
In an email to Quincy residents on Monday, Cheng requested an apology from the perpetrator and for previous “exaggerated attacks” on his character.
“I don’t care about punishment, I would just appreciate a personal apology,” he wrote.
Quincy Faculty Deans Eric Beerbohm and Leslie J. Duhaylongsod condemned the flyers and offered their support to Cheng in an email to House residents that denounced the slurs as "deplorable."
“We want to say in the strongest possible terms that this is absolutely unacceptable; none of these actions is consistent with Quincy’s focus on a safe, respectful, and inclusive community,” they wrote. “Hate has no place at Quincy House.”
The Harvard-Radcliffe Asian American Women’s Association released a statement co-signed by 11 other student groups Monday rebuking the “act of direct racism” and calling on the College to take concrete steps to respond to the incident.
“We actively strive to fight injustices across an intersectional network of issues that affects all of us as students,” the statement reads. “We must not let these actions go unrecognized without consequence.”
Cheng said he was heartened by the messages of support he received.
“I’ve gotten emails and messages from a lot of people,” he said. “It’s definitely great to hear that people care about me.”
In their email, the Quincy faculty deans also solicited information about the incident.
On Monday, Cheng speculated that the vandalism was committed by one of his political opponents.
“I presume if you care enough to do something like this, you’re probably on the UC,” Cheng said.

Just under 4,500 Harvard undergraduates woke up on Valentine’s Day morning to a potentially fateful e-mail: their Datamatch results.
Datamatch, founded in 1994 by the Harvard Computer Society, is a digital matchmaking algorithm. This year’s survey asked students questions on everything from their roommates’ romantic lives to their first Wordle guesses in an attempt to match them with their soulmates, platonic or otherwise.
Katherine Y. Zhu ’23 and Melissa Kwan ’22 led the team of Datamatch’s administrators — known as Cupids — who have been working on the project since last spring.
Zhu said that the algorithm used to match undergraduates who take the survey is a well-kept secret among Datamatch’s team.
“The one thing that I can tell you is it is not random," she said. "Other than that, we will leave it a mystery and for the algo team to know.”
She added that Datamatch is an opportunity for students to meet other people and that she enjoyed hearing about successful matches.
“We really do bring people together and help people meet others that they never would have had an opportunity to otherwise,” Zhu said. “That reminds me every year that all the work that we do in the end is worth it, when we get to hear about all of the success stories that we get told.”
Under Kwan and Zhu, Datamatch developers created new design improvements, added the ability to report inappropriate users, and created a feature allowing students to list their “red flags” in dating and relationships.
“We’ve seen how people really buy into the idea of having these red flags, and they are sharing with their friends about it. That part is really both fun and rewarding for us to see,” Datamatch team member Jared Hu ’25 said.
Despite the new features, Zhu said the biggest difference from last year's survey, which occurred before Harvard fully reopened its campus, is the option for students to meet up with their matches in person.
“One of the biggest things is that we’re coming back from a pandemic,” Zhu said. “Everything was online last year, and I think a big part of Datamatch that was sadly missed last year is that for most of the people who were on campus, you couldn’t really have the opportunity to truly try to meet someone in person.”
Students who participated in the survey can take their top matches on Datamatch-funded dates at Playa Bowls, Ben & Jerry’s, Kung Fu Tea, or restaurants in Harvard Square.
Datamatch pays for the dates with sponsorships from the Undergraduate Council and outside organizations, such as Fizz, a startup founded by Harvard undergraduates, and Bubble.
“I think it’s really thoughtful of Datamatch to provide financial support for your top two matches,” Christina S. Gong ’25 said. “I really like free food, who doesn’t, but I’m also looking forward to just meeting someone new.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Cambridge-based complexes — the Harvard Art Museums and Jefferson Park Apartments — received architectural awards from the Boston Society of Architecture last month.
The Harvard Art Museums Renovation and Expansion received the 2021 BSA's Harleston Parker Medal, while Jefferson Park — a Cambridge-based affordable housing complex — was a finalist and won the People’s Choice Award.
The BSA established the Harleston Parker Medal in 1921 in memory of Boston architect J. Harleston Parker. The medal serves to recognize the “the most beautiful piece of architecture, building, monument or structure” in the Boston area.
This year marks the third time the BSA has recognized Harvard University architecture in the last decade, having awarded the medal to Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center in 2019 and Harvard Graduate Student Housing in 2011.
The BSA jury lauded the Harvard Art Museums Renovation and Expansion for its embodiment of “traditional tenets” while being “welcoming” and “warm.”
“Every inch of this building was considered in the design and construction to work harmoniously together,” the jury wrote in its commentary.
While Harvard is no stranger to the BSA’s prize, Jefferson Park Apartments — built in North Cambridge by the Cambridge Housing Authority — is the first affordable housing development to receive a nomination for the medal.
The jury praised Jefferson Park Apartments as a “transformative project” that exemplifies “community-beauty as a unifier.”
Outside of the BSA’s recognition of the complex, it also received public acclaim, winning the People’s Choice Award for the complex with 57 percent of the public vote.
Despite the complex’s accolade, CHA Executive Director Michael J. Johnston noted that the project’s primary goal was not fame but creating “sustainable and usable” public housing for Cambridge communities.
“About fifteen years ago, the Cambridge Housing Authority came to a realization that public housing as we know it is a dinosaur, that public housing as we know it is really on its way to extinction,” Johnston said.
Johnston explained that Jefferson Park, which started out as temporary housing for veterans, had been “falling apart” until the CHA repurposed it.
“We had 108 units of state public housing that was literally falling down on top of the people that live there [at Jefferson Park],” he said.
Johnston said that Jefferson Park has struggled with “all kinds of mold and mildew issues” due to its construction over land that used to be a pond, forcing the CHA to renovate the complex completely.
“There’s no way to make those properties energy-efficient, there’s no way to make them sustainable,” Johnston said of older affordable housing properties. “If you’re going to worry about the 100-year flood plain in Cambridge, you have to put heating systems and ventilation systems up on the roof — there’s no way to introduce central AC into those buildings.”
Despite the challenges, Johnston said he believes the CHA has done “a good job” with its portfolio, noting that in the last 12 years, the CHA has spent more than $600 million in construction for public housing.
“There’s so much that is changing in the world we live in,” Johnston said. “Affordable housing has to keep up with that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Nina M. S. Jensen ’25 arrived on campus last fall, she was most worried about keeping up with her classes after taking two gap years.
But after returning home on a medical leave just days into the spring semester, she wrote in an email that navigating Harvard’s rigid rules around receiving medical accommodations — not her course load — has been the biggest challenge.
“Their policies are completely arbitrary and baseless, and that is extremely frustrating,” Jensen wrote.
Harvard’s Accessible Education Office provides accommodations to ensure equity in education for students with disabilities. But some students have voiced their exasperation over the College’s accessibility policies, lambasting them as inflexible and unreasonable.
Jensen, who began a leave of absence this semester following medical complications, wrote that there was “no flexibility whatsoever” in the College’s approach to her accommodations.
According to Jensen, she proposed possible alternatives to a leave of absence that would enable her to continue taking classes this semester — including having her mom stay with her on campus or taking a reduced course load virtually from her home in Denmark — but the Administrative Board denied these requests.
“My suggestions were reasonable," she wrote. "I even got approval and support from my professors."
Upon returning home, Jensen learned that the Ad Board had assigned her a University Health Services rider — a series of personal and medical requirements that are a condition to return to campus.
A UHS rider requires students on leave for medical reasons to work full-time for six months. The requirement is flexible in certain circumstances, according to a Harvard spokesperson.
“I was very confused and angry, and I am far from the only victim of this ridiculous policy," Jensen wrote. "They can’t expect someone who can’t even leave the house to get a full-time job.”
“I am a grown adult," she added. "My ability to return should only be up to me and my medical providers.”
Jensen’s accessibility concerns at the College extend back to the fall semester when she requested a move to a quieter dorm room due to her sensitivity to sound. It took over a month for the request to be granted, she wrote.
Other undergraduates also cited difficulty in receiving academic accommodations from Harvard.
Kinara Gasper ’24 was unable to take her Math 21a: “Multivariable Calculus” final after being hospitalized for appendicitis in December. Her exam was postponed to the spring semester’s makeup period for fall exams — just two days after the date her appendectomy was scheduled last-minute.
“I wasn’t allowed to stand up, let alone go and take a math exam,” she said.
An Applied Math concentrator, Gasper said she is “at a loss” because after missing the spring makeup period, she is not permitted to take the exam until September.
“I also don’t know how that’s going to impact what classes I can take next semester,” she said. “What classes can I take now that I have not technically completed 21a?”
Christina L. Gavazzi ’22 said treatments for her medical condition sometimes cause soreness, making it difficult to take notes during her fast-paced General Education class. She asked a teaching fellow for access to lecture slides — a request which was denied.
“It’s just frustrating that what seems like it should be a really simple solution is just not being considered,” Gavazzi said.
Gavazzi said she thinks the AEO is “great” overall but due to high demand for appointments, she must wait two to three weeks to meet with an AEO staff member to formally request accommodations.
Rachel C. Auslander ’22-’23 — co-founder of the Disability Justice Club, a student group that aims to address ableism and inaccessibility at Harvard — said the process of requesting accommodations from AEO takes “way too much time” and “way too many resources.”
Auslander also criticized a policy that students must be formally diagnosed to receive accommodations.
“This is a problem because many students have symptoms, start falling behind, but don’t have an official diagnosis,” she said.
She added it can be “incredibly intimidating and difficult” for students with symptoms to “speak up” for themselves.
College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote that the AEO evaluates each case on an individual basis and sometimes provides “temporary accommodations” when a formal diagnosis is unavailable.
“The office regularly schedules consultation meetings with students who do not yet have formal diagnoses and want to talk through options,” she wrote. “The process does take time, and student meetings are scheduled out weeks in advance. Emergency situations and temporary injuries that need care immediately are prioritized.”
Jensen wrote that she believes Harvard must do "a lot better" to ensure accessibility.
“The first step is to work directly with the students, not just the UC, but the individuals," she wrote. "Right now I am just another statistic. I am a faceless person whose fate is being decided by a group of people I don’t know.”
“I want to be more than that," Jensen added. "I deserve to be more than that."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students rallied in support of sexual harassment survivors at Harvard on Monday in one of the biggest demonstrations on the school’s campus in years.
At promptly 12:15 p.m., students and some faculty members walked out of classes to gather on Harvard’s Science Center Plaza in protest of the University’s handling of sexual harassment allegations against professor John L. Comaroff.
The rally came just shy of one week after a federal lawsuit against Harvard detailed a decade of sexual harassment and professional misconduct allegations against Comaroff.
The walkout demonstrated support for the three graduate students who filed the suit — Margaret G. Czerwienski, Lilia M. Kilburn, and Amulya Mandava. The complaint charged that Harvard enabled Comaroff’s alleged misconduct by ignoring years of harassment claims.
“This case is not about three of us. This case is about all of us,” Kilburn said at the rally Monday. “This case is about Harvard’s failure to provide the prompt and equitable process for dealing with claims of harassment and discrimination that’s required by law.”
Harvard placed Comaroff on unpaid leave last month after University investigations found he violated sexual harassment and professional conduct policies.
Harvard denies the claims in the suit. In a statement last week, Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote that the allegations “are in no way a fair or accurate representation of the thoughtful steps taken by the University in response to concerns that were brought forward, the thorough reviews conducted, and the results of those reviews.”
Czerwienski, a plaintiff on the suit who holds a leadership post in Harvard’s graduate student union, said the Comaroff case underscores the need for third-party arbitration of sexual harassment and discrimination claims — a longstanding union demand.
“We must make it clear to Harvard, to our faculty, and to everyone else who needs to hear it, that we aren’t going to tolerate this indifference to harm on our campuses any longer,” Czerwienski said.
Comaroff serves as a professor of African and African American Studies and Anthropology. On Monday, the chair of Harvard’s Anthropology Department, which has been roiled by claims of sexual harassment, said Harvard’s Title IX processes failed students who have alleged harassment by Comaroff.
“It is no secret that Harvard has a long and sordid history of failing survivors of sexual and gender-based misconduct,” Anthropology chair Ajantha Subramanian said. “The Title IX system was supposed to be the solution. Instead, it has become part of the problem.”
Hundreds of undergraduates walked out of class to attend the rally.
“I am tired of Harvard’s institutional indifference to instances of identity-based abuse and sexual violence,” said Elizabeth A. “Ellie” Corbus ’22. “It’s time Harvard made real substantial change to protect its students instead of continuing to protect its reputation and prestige at the expense of its students.”
After Comaroff was placed on leave last month by Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay, 38 professors signed onto an open letter questioning the sanctions. But last week, after the lawsuit was filed, all but three of the professors who signed onto the initial letter retracted their support for the message.
On Monday, Czerwienski said the initial letter brought “tremendous harm to our community.”
“It’s our job to keep insisting that they take responsibility for the damage that they have done,” she said.

On a frigid Monday night in Boston, the Harvard Men’s Hockey team took on the Boston College Eagles in the consolation game of the 69th Annual Beanpot Collegiate Hockey Tournament. After three 20-minute periods and a five-minute additional overtime, the teams remained tied at three.
Sophomore goalkeeper Derek Mullahy started between the posts, a change from junior Mitchell Gibson, who had started the last eight games. Mullahy recorded 26 saves over the course of the contest.
“I thought it was a hard fought game,” head coach Ted Donato said. “Both teams really battled all the way to the end.”
The Crimson started the game flat and with a low intensity level. Within the first two minutes, junior forward Austin Wong was charged with a major penalty for contact to the head. Harvard was subsequently sent to the penalty kill for the next five minutes, and Wong was ejected from the game.
After Wong’s critical error, the Eagles dominated possession. They opened up the scoring at 8:24, as junior forward Liam Izyk found the net, assisted by graduate student forward Brendon Kruse.
BC played a very physical game, as many Harvard players, including first-year Alex Gaffney, found themselves up against the boards after being crushed by checks.
“I don’t think we played a particularly intelligent game. We chased the game a bit,” said Ted Donato, particularly lamenting the early penalty.
The Crimson had a power play opportunity after the Eagles’ Jack St. Ivany was called for tripping first-year defenseman Ian Moore. During the man-advantage, it was able to record a few more shots, but was unable to convert. Overall, the Eagles led in shots on goal in the period just eight to six, but they dominated shot attempts and possession by a much larger margin.
The second period began slowly, with the physicality of the game preventing any dangerous offensive chances. However, 12:24 into the second, Harvard was able to turn the tide shorthanded. With first-year defenseman Jack Bar in the box for slashing, first-year Zakary Karpa evened the score, tying the game off of a beautifully executed two-on-one breakaway with first-year forward Matthew Coronato.
However, despite allowing the shorthanded goal, BC was able to successfully execute in the remaining power play time, as sophomore forward Colby Ambrosio found twine to put the Eagles back in front 2-1.
The Eagles rode this momentum and added another goal, this time Izyk again, with 2:17 left in the period, sending the teams back to the locker room with BC in front by a score of 3-1.
The third period was the Crimson’s strongest. It came out quick, with Gaffney finding the net just over a minute into the period. Sophomore forward Alex Laferriere was credited with the assist, as Gaffney, driving hard to the net, redirected Lafferiere’s strong pass from the top of the circle past Eagles goaltender Eric Dop.
Mullahy, although strong throughout the game, had a particularly excellent third. His most crucial save came about eight and a half minutes into the period, a stop of an Ambrosio breakaway that would have given the Eagles a two-goal lead.
Harvard continued its energy, maintaining possession and taking time to properly set up its offense to set up good scoring chances. Eventually, its work bore fruit; with about five minutes remaining in the game, senior forward Jack Donato tied the game up when he corralled a loose puck in front of the net and slid it past Dop.
Jack Donato, who had spoken previously about the significance of the Beanpot to him and his graduating senior class, said, “We thought we didn’t play our best [at the Beanpot], so we just have to compartmentalize it…Every game from here on in is important.”
After Jack Donato’s goal, neither team would record another score, forcing a three-on-three, five-minute overtime period. Overtime brought very similar intensity from the Crimson, who again maintained control of the puck for the majority of the time.
Moore drew a penalty after his strong drive to the net inclined a BC defenseman to foul, giving Harvard an extra skater. However, the Crimson were unable to utilize its advantage, as the Eagles’ masked man Dop came up with some huge saves under pressure.
The team has a homestand doubleheader this weekend at Bright-Landry Hockey Center, taking on Princeton on Friday at 7 p.m. before a critical matchup Saturday against No.2 Quinnipiac, also at 7 p.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PHILADELPHIA – As the clock ticked down and the Penn faithful rose to their feet inside the Palestra, Coach Tommy Amaker took a quick look at the scoreboard in dismay as Harvard men’s basketball lost another agonizingly close game – falling to the Quakers by a 82-74 margin.
For a third straight contest and a fourth time in five games, the Crimson (11-10, 3-6 Ivy) mounted a comeback in a critical game, tying the score in Philadelphia with under two minutes to play. After losing three games to Ivy rivals by a combined 10 points – one to Penn in Cambridge and back-to-back losses to Yale – completing Saturday’s comeback at the Ivy League’s premier venue would have gone a long way towards reversing Harvard’s fortune this season. A series of clutch shots by guard Jordan Dingle, including a banked three-pointer as the shot clock expired, ensured that the Crimson would lose yet another heartbreaker.
“You’ve got to give them credit, and you’ve got to give him credit in particular,” said Amaker of Dingle’s 33-point performance, which took place just 15 days after the sophomore scored 31 points at Lavietes Pavilion to lead Penn (11-12, 8-2) to a 78-74 win in Cambridge. “We need something to fall our way a little bit, that’s not an excuse or anything, but you need that.”
Amaker’s remarks echo the frustration that many involved in the men’s basketball program will certainly be feeling, as Harvard sits in sixth place in the Ivy League with just five games remaining. The past two weeks have brought four losses that came on a knife’s edge, leaving the Crimson on the brink of desperation in the battle for an Ivy League playoff spot.
With Lavietes Pavilion set to play host to this year’s Ancient Eight tournament, failing to finish the season in the top four and make the semifinals would leave a particularly bitter taste for the men’s basketball program given its recent history in the Ivy League postseason. Harvard has lost the past two Ivy League championship games in true road settings and has long looked forward to hosting the tournament in Cambridge after missing out on the opportunity to do so in 2020 due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Saturday afternoon’s game featured the type of seesaw action that the Crimson is well-accustomed to in battles with Coach Steve Donohue’s Penn Quakers. Harvard clawed its way back from an eight point second-half deficit, in large part due to the inspired play of first-year guard Evan Nelson, who led the team in scoring. Nelson scored a career-high 19 points, drilling all five of his three-pointers and bringing the Crimson back into the game on numerous occasions as the Quakers looked to pull away.
“It’s a lot of fun, playing at the Palestra, it’s obviously a coveted and historic arena,” Nelson said. “But it would have felt a lot better to get this win, without a doubt.”
Nelson’s play was all the more crucial with fellow first-year Louis Lesmond’s continued absence from the rotation due to injury, the latest in an unrelenting string of injuries that Harvard has been forced to deal with this season. His resurgence is perhaps even more necessary as a third guard capable of scoring alongside junior Luka Sakota and senior Noah Kirkwood, as the two have borne the brunt of opposing teams’ defensive attention in the past few weeks. The Canadian backcourt duo have been forced to work extremely hard for high-quality looks with Lesmond, Chris Ledlum, and Idan Tretout sidelined with various injuries, combining for 26 points against Penn defense that seemed hell-bent on neutralizing them.
Donohue and Penn employed a variety of defensive tactics on Saturday, including doubling Kirkwood on the final play of the half, pulling a defender away from first-year guard Denham Wojcik. Wojcik, who has featured as the starting point guard for Coach Amaker in all but one of Harvard’s Ivy League games, has struggled significantly to find his shooting touch thus far, converting on 22% of his field goals and just 2-of-21 from beyond the arc.
Nelson’s emergence as a viable scoring threat and potential starter could be just what the Crimson need, particularly to shoulder some of the scoring burden that Kirkwood and Sakota have carried in the backcourt thus far. The Tucson, Ariz. native credited the leadership of older players as a source of mentorship and confidence in him, with Saturday afternoon’s contest representing just the eighth game in Nelson’s young career.
“It’s definitely a team thing,” Nelson said. “From Spencer, to Noah, Mason, and Kale, all those guys have taken it upon themselves to take me under their wing.”
Though Nelson’s prolific scoring on Saturday was an encouraging sign, time is running out for men’s basketball. With a two game homestand against the New York schools upcoming, anything shy of a 2-0 weekend would almost certainly eliminate Harvard from Ivy League tournament contention. Perhaps this is how the NCAA tournament drought must end for the Crimson: not with a #1 seed and a clear path to Ivy Madness, but through what essentially amounts to playoff games beginning in mid-February.
“You know, it’s certainly disappointing,” said Amaker of the team’s recent run of narrow defeats. “But it hasn’t demoralized us.”
Harvard has certainly shown no quit thus far, even after consecutive gut-wrenching losses. Players like sophomore Sam Silverstein, senior captain Kale Catchings, and others have shown a willingness to fill in in unexpected places due to injury. But with March looming, the road to make the tournament is certainly long, and the Crimson’s odds are maybe even longer. But an undefeated weekend against Columbia and Cornell – the team Harvard is chasing – would provide a jolt that the Crimson sorely needs after three straight hard-luck losses. In Ancient Eight basketball, anything is possible.
Perhaps it’s Nelson that’ll be the spark. Or Kirkwood, who has taken the team on his shoulders on several occasions this season and recently tallied his 1000th point for Harvard men’s basketball. Or an unexpected hero – maybe another buzzer beater from Sakota. But with the Ivy League tournament less than a month away, there is suddenly very little room for error.

As you can probably tell by the pic above, my friends are pretty intense sports people (one of them, Bridget, is even a ~Crimson Sports~ writer). I constantly hear them talking in code about the scores of miscellaneous games, trades of players, the MLB lockdown (??), attractive kickers in the draft…the list goes on. I’ve admired witnessing their passion and commitment to following not one, but several sports teams at once. It’s impressive.
This year I decided to buy into the mindset and watch the Super Bowl LVI as if I knew what was going on. Don’t worry, I do in fact know how football works (I’m not that much of a NARP), but I didn’t fully comprehend all of the planning and hype that goes into watching experiencing the Super Bowl in particular. Here’s what went into the night:
1. Acquiring *Drip*
One would assume that by “drip”, I mean wearing jerseys. But no. True fans, like my friends, go one step further. They buy knock-off Cartier sunglasses a la Joe Shiesty (or Burrow?? or Brr??? I’m still confused tbh). While they fangirl over him, they also all agree that “the kicker” is hotter. Now that’s a bandwagon I can get on board with.
2. The FOOD
This one is pretty self-explanatory to any human being, regardless of your interest in sports. While the classic Domino’s Pizza and Buffalo Wings were ordered far in advance for the viewing, I was surprised to be met by a wide array of Trader Joe’s snacks, including Organic White Truffle Potato Chips and Milk Chocolate Covered Peanut Butter Pretzels. Amid a foreign environment, it was nice to have a literal *taste* of familiarity. Time to dig in.
3. Making noise…but also shutting up
Knowing when to make the proper amount of noise during a football game is an art form. I used to assume that the more noise you can make throughout the game, the better, but that is simply *not* the case. Knowing when to be dead-silent is arguably more important. The worst thing you can do is cause a distraction during an important play or interrupt a fan’s ~villain origin story~ when their team is forced to kick a field goal because they can’t “convert a touchdown.” So, when watching the game, I learned that the best thing to do is follow the lead of those around you: when they cheer, scream; when they go silent, shut it.
4. Bopping along to the halftime show (oh yeahh)
FINALLY. Now for the good stuff. While my friends sat around and strategized about what they thought was going to happen in the second half, I sat back, relaxed, and enjoyed something much more relatable: the halftime show. This was a prime opportunity to wow my sports-savvy friends with my music knowledge and level the ~playing field~ (oh yes I did). This year, I vibed with Snoop and praised Kendrick as they reminded me of what real entertainment feels like.
5. Making my ~Exit~
Okay, I said I would watch the Super Bowl like a true fan, but after the halftime show ended, I had served my time. I gave myself a pat on the back for my valiant efforts, and my friends appreciated my immersion into their world. At that point, it was past 9 p.m., which meant one thing: Euphoria. (It’s like a reward.)
All in all, joining my friends in their sports-centered insanity was a lot of fun. Do I now plan to convert to a full-blown sports groupie like them? Eh, probably not. I am already set in my ways. That being said, there is something so touching about watching someone shed real tears (both happy and sad) over people running around and throwing balls. If you haven’t witnessed it for yourself, I highly recommend it.
