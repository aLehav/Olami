After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In January, an annual survey—The American Freshman: National Norms—released an assessment of the emotional and mental wellbeing of first-year students at American colleges, the results of which notably included two sections entitled: “Students’ Perceived Emotional Health at Record Low” and “Expectations of Satisfaction and Participation in College Activities at Record Highs.” This stupefying contradiction might sound familiar to anyone who picked up a copy of Fifteen Minutes last Thursday and read “I Am Fine,” a poignant and anonymous portrayal of personal pain that struck a chord that resonated profoundly throughout the student body. The article’s popularity—it received 82 comments and 993 Likes and counting on Facebook—is a thundering testament to how deeply each one of us recognizes our own face in this anonymous portrait , whether as fellow Harvard students or just as kindred spirits.
We cannot ignore such an outpouring of emotion and solidarity, and moving forward, the College, too, must heed this clarion call: Harvard must prioritize the emotional well-being of its students from day one. This change necessitates a shift in campus culture away from solipsism and toward a positive atmosphere that inspires students to care more about the peers they encounter on a daily basis. There must be more candid conversation and more interpersonal interaction.
Hands down, a crucial move the College could make is to encourage more one-on-one contact among students. An institution responsible for the food, shelter, and activity of nearly 6,000 gifted individuals cannot shy away from this responsibility. As the anonymous author describes, Harvard students are often too absorbed in the spheres of their own ambitions to pay close attention to the emotional signals being emitted by their peers, or to want to emit any signals of their own. Perfectionism is an ugly beast which, as many students understand, can manifest itself in a 4.0 or in an unshakeable insistence on showing the world that no matter what happens, “I Am Fine”.  It is time for us as a community to rethink whichever “Expectations of Satisfaction and Participation in College Activities” are not helping us enjoy college, and instead are dragging us down. Closer relationships among students and a culture of comfortable conversation among peers—“strangers” as well as friends—are essential in curbing this Harvard-wide, if not nationwide, sense of student malaise.
In this vein, there are a few concrete steps we believe the College can take toward building a new support structure for and among its lifeblood: the student body. Harvard should raise awareness about mental health as much as it does about drugs and alcohol, by way of institutions as prolific as the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors or information sessions on resources as informative as library research tutorials. A delicate and transparent treatment of the topic—that is to say, one neither condescending nor heavy-handed—could potentially de-stigmatize the issue of mental health on campus and help more students in need to come forward. In this way could Harvard become a community in which admitting “I Am Not Fine” does not feel as sinful as a red letter on one’s chest. Through such a mechanism, the College could ensure that all its students are well equipped to identify signs of emotional distress among their peers which, although not uniform, are much easier to recognize once known. We are the ones best positioned to notice when a blockmate or friend is under unusual levels of stress and anxiety, so we should have the knowledge to identify a serious problem no matter how deep it may be buried.
Harvard’s existing mental health resources are effective, but if we demand structural change, then they must be bolstered by initiatives that are proactive rather than just reactive. Without this framework shift, Harvard students will continue doing what they do best: pouring themselves into studies and activities and ignoring how little of themselves there is left to pour out, sometimes until it is too late.
We commend the author of this piece, Student X, for giving voice and form to a problem that leaves many students speechless. As fellow students and as sympathizers, we express our gratitude to this brave writer for demonstrating the power of sincere emotional communication. Instead of texting, we could connect with the person sitting right next to us, just as we have with this anonymous student—if we take the time and bravery to open up. We, as much as the College, must address the trend that this student has thrown into sharp relief. We must have the courage to admit when we are “Not Fine,” for as this author has experienced, anyone who does need not be alone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over bagels and pastries earlier this month, President Barack H. Obama finally convinced this country that he is not a Muslim. Or at least he tried.
“My Christian faith has been sustaining for me over the last couple of years,” Obama noted in an unusually personal speech at the National Prayer Breakfast. “Even more so when Michelle and I hear our faith questioned from time to time.” He also detailed his transformation into a born-again Christian, and mentioned his Christian spiritual mentors, including a young minister who “starts my morning off with meditations from scripture.” 
The National Prayer Breakfast has been a prime networking event in Washington since the Eisenhower administration. Presidents don’t normally go for the gusto at these meetings: Obama, for example, has previously used these breakfasts to stress such controversial topics as the healing power of world religions and the necessity of bipartisan “civility” in the wake of Haiti. 
This year’s breakfast, however, came on the heels of a Pew poll in August demonstrating that 18 percent of Americans believe that our president is a Muslim. This misconception flourishes on the right, with a 14 percent increase among Republicans in calling the president a Muslim since 2009. A minister who was consulted on Obama’s breakfast speech noted that he and the White House were caught off-guard by the Pew poll, and affirmed the speech’s necessity in correcting this misconception. "He needs to openly declare himself a Christian and not settle for people's skepticism” the minister told CNN. Michael Scherer echoed this sentiment on Time Magazine’s Swampland blog, asserting that Obama’s speech was “a signal to the Republican field” that the President “will not allow others to define his own beliefs for him.”
But how necessary are Obama’s attempts to spread the Gospel of his Christian faith? And how effective will they actually be?
Although the media made lots of hay over the infamous “Muslim President” Pew poll this past summer, 18 percent is actually a very low number when it comes to baseless beliefs in this country. As Matthew G. Yglesias ’03 noted on his blog, according to a Gallup poll from 2005, more than twice as many Americans who believe that the President is secretly a Muslim believe that houses can be haunted. That same poll indicates that a quarter of this country believes in astrology, and 21 percent believe that people can communicate mentally with the deceased. In fact, approximately the same number of Americans who believe that the president is a closet Muslim also believe that witches exist. Given the preponderance of absurd beliefs in the United   States, should it really bother Obama that under one fifth of Americans consider him a follower of the Prophet?
Furthermore, those on the right who truly think that Obama is a Muslim won’t be swayed by official assurances that he isn’t. Consider the birther movement. More than two full years into Obama’s presidency, this movement is still as politically vibrant as ever—a poll released last week revealed that a majority of Republican primary voters believe that Obama was not born in this country. This is despite all of the evidence available dating back to the genesis of this smear during the 2008 elections, including Obama’s actual Hawaiian birth certificate, viewable online, and two separate major Hawaiian newspapers documenting Obama’s birth on August 4, 1961.
Indeed, the persistence of anti-Obama conspiracy theories may reflect something far more psychological than informational. The Pew Research  Center notes that “those who say [the president] is a Muslim overwhelmingly disapprove of his job performance, while a majority of those who think he is a Christian approve of the job Obama is doing.” A  Newsweek article from August corroborates this finding by citing a political psychology experiment designed by a team from Michigan State  University. The article concludes by citing the head researcher: “When people are unsatisfied with the president, whether it’s the way he’s handling the economy, health care, Afghanistan,” he says, “our research suggests that this only fuels their readiness to accept untrue rumors.” Indeed, the article notes, it is no coincidence that the prevalence of belief in Obama’s Islamic faith has increased in “inverse lockstep” with the president’s job approval rating.
In an interview last week, Sarah Palin refudiated those who deny Obama’s citizenship and Christianity. “The faith, the birth certificate, others can engage in that kind of conversation,” she said. “Those are distractions” from “what really matters,” which is “the economy” and “policies coming out of [the president’s] administration.” Obama should listen to her. If the president truly wants to squash those untrue rumors about his faith, he needs to pay attention to the issues and focus his efforts on getting his approval rating up. Because if Obama actually thinks that his breakfast speech will convince naysayers of his Christianity, the man doesn’t have a prayer.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barely turned in problem set, class until 10 p.m., research paper due tomorrow—we’ve all been there. We walk into the dining hall looking for sustenance and sympathy when we put our bag down next to a familiar face. Instead, we get our worst nightmare: a story topper.
By definition, a story topper is someone who can outdo any tale no matter how outlandish—be it related to workloads, extracurricular activities or relationships. On your worst day, story toppers make you want to go for their jugular. Story toppers are emblematic of Harvard students’ hypercompetitive streak—often to the point of absurdity. If you’ve never had an experience with a story topper, chances are that you are one.
The inevitability of going to a school like Harvard, ranked number one in the U.S News & World Report rankings, is that you will meet people who are better than you at. most things. But tensions can arise when the best and brightest are thrown together on one—albeit sprawling—campus. With its inherent ability to breed competition, Harvard houses more than its share of the most insidious story toppers around. They always seem to have more papers due than their peers, longer waiting periods for the shuttle, and an endless compulsion to one-up their friends’ complaints. The result? While they inevitably “win” their complaint wars, the process is frustrating and overwhelming for all.
While story topping is openly acknowledged to be annoying and crass, the practice has also unfortunately become a Harvard practice that perpetuates a pretentious and often spiteful competitive spirit on campus. Sadly, the one-upmanship of story topping has become a source of pride for many.
Story topping in the academic and extracurricular arenas “rewards” the people who are the busiest, most stressed and closest to their breaking points by making them seem ever more impressive for their busy schedules. Given the mental issues that stress can incite, we should not be harboring a tradition that promotes the idea that more anxiety means more success.
Before we mentally or verbally condemn our friends for giving us the sardonic “Oh, really?” after we voice our endless complaints, we should take a moment to sympathize with our obviously delusional story-topping friends. We each seem to believe that our life is harder than our neighbor’s, and this could be the source of our unwillingness to sympathize with others. While I once thought the description of Harvard as “cutthroat” was incorrect, I now understand that the adjective more accurately describes our personal lives than our academic ones.
We need to realize that we’re all busy and highly motivated. But until we start supporting each other in our respective endeavors and sympathizing with each other’s complaints, our mantra will continue to be “I Am Fine.” Next time, instead of labeling friends who complain about stress as “weak” and trying to put them in their place by complaining even further, let them vent. Tell them what they need to hear—rough stuff, get some sleep, and good luck. We are a community and should consistently act like one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty years ago, the newly-elected President John F. Kennedy ‘40 addressed the country on a frigid January morning. In an inaugural address that has been quoted as many times as a single speech can be, President Kennedy posed a potent challenge to the nation: “Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country."
Since the beginning of the Volunteers in Service to America program in 1964, millions of young Americans have aspired to fulfill President Kennedy’s challenge with meaningful service to their communities, and it is in this legacy that AmeriCorps was founded in 1993. Envisioned as a way to unite an entire generation to better our country, our nation’s flagship service organization has since allowed over 540,000 Americans to strengthen their communities through initiatives in education, public safety, health care, and the environment.
AmeriCorps has long enjoyed bipartisan support. President George H.W. Bush laid the foundation for the program, with his vision for “a thousand points of light.” President William J. Clinton championed the creation of AmeriCorps, and President George W. Bush proudly expanded the program, hailing its enormous impact. In 2009, more than a third of House Republicans and more than half of Senate Republicans voted to quadruple the number of AmeriCorps members as part of the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.”
Yet despite the millions of hours of service, the thousands of educated students, the countless houses AmeriCorps members have built, streets they have cleaned, and hearts they have lifted, the House of Representatives voted last week for a budget proposal that would cut all of AmeriCorps’ federal funding. As part of a sweeping effort to address the growing federal deficit, House leaders have unwisely committed to slash government support of a host of critical programs, and AmeriCorps is chief among them.
At Harvard, these cuts have a wide impact. As a coalition of university students, prospective Teach for America corps members, and alumni of a variety of AmeriCorps programs, we will experience these cuts personally. The dozens of Harvard seniors who have committed to Teach for America will lose more than $10,000 each in educational grants to cover their certification costs and further their education. The undergraduates who hope to work with AmeriCorps to preserve the environment or serve in a community health clinic will see their opportunities dwindle. The elimination of AmeriCorps will be felt most sharply by America’s already vulnerable communities. The service alumni among us realize that with the loss of every City Year, AmeriCorps, or TFA member, another family and community in need loses an ally.
However dire the state of our national finances, America’s true wealth is on display with the 75,000 people who give themselves to national service every year. Our political leaders are willing to work together to preserve this vital national institution, but they will only do so if we make our voices heard. Fortunately, there is a golden opportunity for us to stand up for AmeriCorps. This afternoon, House majority leader Eric Cantor is coming to speak at the Institute of Politics. We are asking you to stand with us at 5:30 p.m. today to show our leaders in Congress that eliminating AmeriCorps will have a real human impact. We intend to show Leader Cantor that AmeriCorps is more than worth its federal investment.
The effort, however, does not begin or end with the rally, and we need your help if we are to preserve our nation’s investment in our communities. We ask you to join thousands of other supporters in signing the Save AmeriCorps online petition and to contact your congressional leaders on Friday and tell them that you oppose the elimination of the Corporation for National and Community Service, the federal umbrella agency that incorporates AmeriCorps, Senior Corps and other service programs. There are thousands of young people willing to rise to President Kennedy’s call for service and, as the AmeriCorps Pledge states, “bring Americans together to strengthen our communities.” So that they may rise to this challenge, we, too, must pull together and demand the governmental support for AmeriCorps that it rightfully deserves.

The youth basketball league in our town is known as Hoops—just that one single-syllable word, without any mention of the league or the youth. It’s a bit of ingenious branding; since its founding, Hoops has become the main engine of local basketball intrigue. The Sixers and the local college teams are too distant, the varsity squad is just somebody else’s kids, but Hoops is about us and our wins and losses in our rec centers and middle school gyms. All Hoops asks for is a small fee and a few nights each week from January to March. There aren’t any tryouts because Hoops isn’t about tryouts and because in our town, everybody already knows who’s good and who isn’t.
I played for one season in my freshman year of high school. I wasn’t good. In fact, I was the worst player on the worst team in the league, although our endless losing streak was actually a surprise. The dads and uncles who run Hoops spend hours sifting through names and deliberating over lineups for the sake of parity. We—the Dragons, in black uniforms—received our fair share of athletes: the football player looking for something to do in the offseason, the skinny kid who always drove it in, the senior with long arms who stuck to shooting threes. We even had a coach who cared, as humanly possible as it was to care, about intramural youth basketball.
That season was our coach’s debut. He was in his 50s, balding and short, but he knew basketball, and the man could hold his own against any of us during practice pick-up games. The mystery of our inability to win burdened him the most. He switched up formations and even called us at home for our input, which was at least thoughtful. “How about we call you Yao from now on?” he asked me after one especially fruitless session. “I don’t know if that’s offensive, but how about we give it a try?” After two weeks of straight losses, he brought a little plastic dragon that he had kept from his days at Drexel, and he asked us to huddle around and put our hands over it. “We’re putting the past behind us, boys,” he said. “This is a fresh start.” We lost that game by more than 20 points. We didn’t even reach double digits until the second half.
He always came with a smile that knew how things would end. He clapped during our half-hearted warm-up drills, patted us on the back as we got in the huddle, held the little plastic dragon and had us put our hands over it. Then the game would start, and he would pace along his half of the sideline like a caged cat and shout orders and work the rotation, because Hoops was about community and community meant equal playing time for all. And every time we successfully ran a screen, or held a one-or two-point lead—however briefly—he would get a look in his eye that contained all the light of that word “maybe.”
I’d like to be able to say that it was contagious, that for us it became less about winning and more about putting in your all or having fun, as he tried to do. But after a month, we began skipping games on a regular basis, and many of those later losses were forfeits due to a lack of players. I missed several games myself, but I was also there for the days when it would be just three or four of us, and he would shrug and say, “That’s it, guys. Go on home.”
It ended in the spring. At the time, the tri-state area was in rapture over Saint Joe’s, the little Catholic school that flew through an undefeated regular season and reached the fourth round of March Madness before falling to Oklahoma State. The Dragons finished their season, winless. We often saw each other at school afterwards, at lunch or between classes, never more than two of us at once. We always made sure to smile and nod. The dads and uncles of Hoops spent the following months trying to understand what had gone so wrong. And I retired from intramural basketball after my rookie season. I never found out if our coach did the same.

I’ll admit it. I was on the infamous “hostage shuttle” on Saturday, Jan. 22, 2011. That’s right—I boarded the unmarked, white, Harvard-shuttle-bus-look-alike that was not, in fact, the 10:10 p.m. shuttle going to the Quad. In our defense, it was dark. In our defense, the fake shuttle rolled up to the official Harvard stop. In our defense, we were engaged in conversations that distracted us from the fact that the hostage shuttle lacked any markings suggesting it was, in fact, a Harvard-affiliated vehicle.
Was it thoughtless of us? Yes. Am I humiliated? Slightly. Here’s what one of the people who commented on the Crimson article about the counterfeit shuttle had to say:
Guest: “I’m embarrassed that there are students at Harvard, who are dumb enough to jump into a random, unmarked van. They’re lucky they got charged $5 instead of kidnapped or killed.”
Yikes, that’s harsh, and perhaps somewhat merited. But here is one important defense of our negligent actions: the official shuttle was late. It was 10:23 p.m. by the time the wannabe shuttle, in its unmarked glory, approached the stop in front of Wigglesworth Hall.
This tardiness was not an exception to the rule this semester. The shuttles have been noticeably worse than any other time in my tenure as a Quadling. One of my blockmates recently took a shuttle that was 17 minutes late. Another, after waiting 20 minutes for the 4:45 p.m. shuttle, opted to take a taxi back to the Quad instead of continuing to wait in the cold. My friend who did hold out informed me that the shuttle never arrived—the 5:10 p.m. shuttle finally showed up at 5:15 p.m. I was on a shuttle that arrived in the Quad 15 minutes after its theoretical departure time, thereby delaying those who were waiting to take it to the River.
There have been countless shuttles that have shown up late or have been too small to accommodate all of the students who would like to take them. Transportation Services, the sector of the University Operations Services (UOS) that runs the shuttles, has been employing smaller shuttles recently (I heard a rumor that they are better in cold and snowy weather). But small shuttles leave some Quadlings in the cold, and this is simply unacceptable. When, for example, on Feb. 12, Pforzheimer House hosted the popular “Make It Rain” dance, boarding a shuttle at Boylston Gate was about as easy as trying to type an essay in Sanskrit with one’s toes—for those of us who don’t speak Sanskrit or have particularly flexible toes.
Something must be done. I understand that the mediocre weather has probably made reliable shuttle schedules difficult to adhere to, but the recent woes incurred by Quadlings and Quad-lovers are simply unacceptable. UOS should reconsider routes, especially during rush hour. More shuttles should be available during nights when mini-shuttles must be used, or when the Quad is a popular destination, such as during “Make It Rain.” Shuttles should leave on time, so they can arrive on time. Many students’ schedules rely on predictable shuttles, which they justifiably expect.
I wrote an e-mail to Shuttle Services to air my grievances, but to no avail. A fellow Quad resident called the shuttle number to express concerns over recent inconsistencies, but she was told to “plan ahead.” Hogwash! Planning ahead demands reliability. I recently “planned ahead” by opting to take a 6:45 p.m. shuttle in lieu of a 6:50 p.m. shuttle to ensure I would not be tardy for a 7:00 p.m. appointment on the River. But in any case, no shuttle left until 6:53 p.m. Is that planning ahead? Or is it just a waste of time?
Students should not have to pay for a taxi because a shuttle is late, ever. Shuttles should not be late, especially when it is below freezing outside. Having a shuttle service at all is a luxury, and I certainly appreciate it. Other colleges do not have shuttle services, and many students elsewhere live farther away from their campuses than Quadlings do here. Still, the House community is so tied into the Harvard experience that I believe it is  fair for those of us who were assigned to live in the Quad to expect a dependable transportation service.
I love living in the Quad. I would not substitute my residence in Currier for any other housing option at Harvard. I love our tight-knit community, excellent dining hall, and luxurious housing. But the shuttle service is one aspect of Quad life that has been inconsistent at best. I am generally happy to walk, but sometimes it is simply too cold, or too dark, or I am carrying something heavy, or I am in a rush. There are some fabulous shuttle drivers who are never late, and whom I deeply appreciate; I recognize that it is a thankless job and generally express my gratitude upon exiting the shuttle. But right now, the only other thing going for the shuttles is the fact that they’re marked—and free.

Like many Harvard students, the new Adams House Head Chef juggles multiple commitments. Jerome R. Picca is not only dedicated to satiating the appetites of Adams residents—he also works to satisfy locals on a budget at his tapas bar, Small Plates, which is located at 56 JFK Street. Last Wednesday, the successful entrepreneur was invited to speak in front of a packed Fong Auditorium at an event entitled “The Art (and Taste) of Leadership.”
As he explained at the panel, Picca arrived in Cambridge three years ago with the goal of providing an elegant dining experience. A tapas bar, he said, would allow him to offer unique dishes that wouldn’t cost a fortune.
In October, the restaurateur—who has worked in the business for over 14 years—embarked on a new culinary adventure: HUHDS. When asked how he manages his two positions, Picca explained: “For me, it’s all about trusting my employees ... It’s what allows me to be here [at Harvard].”
The Head Chef at Small Plates, Ronald D. Hancock, commented that this arrangement “allows for us all to work well together and be very creative in our dishes.”
The Harvard name attracts not only students but HUHDS employees as well. “Harvard has a great food service program,” Picca said. “There’s a lot of room for personal growth and a large, supportive community of students and staff.”
Providing food for thousands of students is a daunting task. But for the HUHDS staff, Picca explained, it is also seen as a way to add value to students’ lives—and chefs are always looking for ways to improve the experience and accommodate everyone.
Quincy House Chef Salvatore Uccello agreed that satisfying students is the most gratifying part of the job.  “We want to make them happy and keep smiles on their faces because, for us, that’s what it’s all about,” he said.

Hey HMS Professor, Sat Bir Singh Khalsa: 
Your research shows that meditation can alleviate stress, anxiety, mood disturbance, and musculoskeletal problems. You also say that it can enhance cognitive and physical performance in musicians. What would you recommend to Harvard students as they enter midterm season?
Meditation, slow breathing, and yoga can be extremely helpful in helping students prepare for tests. The typical study habits of college students are counterproductive. They tend to stay up late the night before an exam and cram. They therefore take exams sleep-deprived and stressed, which hampers performance. You are better off spending half as much time studying and then using that extra time for stress reduction activities like yoga and sleep.

I’m starting to feel just a little abused like a coffee machine in an office. This is pathetic and sardonic. Everyone’s watching. But that’s the deal my dear. What you get is exactly what you give. So give it up to me.
Darling it is no joke, this is lyncanthropy. So objection! I don’t wanna be the exception. You don’t even bother judging the angles of this triangle. Every 20 seconds you repeat her name. Waka waka. Say it again. Tell me one more time. This isn’t over.
The moon’s awake now with eyes wide open, the moon’s my teacher and I’m her student. My will and self-restraint have come to fail now, fail now. Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent. Lucky that my breasts are small and humble so you don’t confuse them with mountains.
Baby I would climb the Andes solely to count the freckles on your body, never could imagine there were only 10 million ways to love somebody. Don’t you see baby asi es perfecto. No fighting, no fighting. I don’t really know what I’m doing. You seem to have a plan. This is your moment, no hesitation. We’re getting closer. I’m at your feet!
And I’ll play the games that you want me to play. My body’s craving, so feed the hungry. It’s like a coffee machine. That’s the deal my dear.

Kevin R. came out to his roommate at the end of freshman fall, the night before he left Harvard for a mandatory year of absence. They had never gotten along, but Kevin was distraught at having to leave and thought his roommate, who was gay himself, would be understanding. “I’d had a bit to drink and I just needed someone to empathize with me, someone who could relate to me at some level,” Kevin says. It was a mistake: Kevin’s roommate betrayed his confidence and told a few of the wrong people.
He has returned to campus after a year working and living with his older boyfriend: a life completely out. “Now I’ve come back to this closeted lifestyle, which sucks,” says Kevin, who didn’t want his real name to be used. “Having to lie and sneak around is no good way to live, and that’s why I have to start coming out.” His eyes are soft between his cheekbones, set deep into the square of his face. He stares purposefully out to space and swallows between sentences.
In high school, Kevin was terrified of making his sexuality public. “I was very worried, scared to death of being outed,” he says. “No one knew.” He told his parents a few months into his year off, but the news was not well received in his conservative family; the first thing his mother did was send him a book called “Christians Turning the Homosexuals Straight.” Things improved over time, however. Kevin says, “They figured out their love is more important than prejudice, I guess.”
Now he has told a few close friends and plans on continuing to come out gradually. Kevin is a varsity athlete and insists that he is not a “snippy-poodle type of gay.” “It’s been a big surprise to everyone I’ve told, so apparently I’m a really good actor,” he says. Last week, he told his current roommate. “He didn’t know how to react,” Kevin remembers. “He kept saying, ‘No one’s ever told me that before, I don’t know, I’m just shocked.’ And I was like, ‘Come on, man, it’s not about you.’”
I. HISTORY OF A HOUSE DIVIDED
Timothy P. McCarthy ’93 is a lecturer on History and Literature and on Public Policy, and Director of the Carr Center’s Human Rights and Social Movements Program. He is also a senior resident tutor and LGBT advisor in Quincy House. He sits at his desk in office number six, which has one window looking onto Mt. Auburn St. and one wall taken up by an enormous bookcase: there are clearly far too many books, but the overflow is carefully stacked and picture frames are snugly nestled in between the volumes.
McCarthy was in the closet when he was an undergraduate at Harvard. He remembers being asked by his advisee Marco Chan ’11, now co-chair of the Queer Students and Allies (QSA), whether he was the president of the QSA’s predecessor when he was at the College. “I was a different person back then—a skinny, working-class jock kid who really wanted to get into  a final club,” McCarthy laughs. He came out in grad school in New York City while writing his dissertation on the Abolitionist movement. (McCarthy notes that the phrase “coming out” has an even longer history, dating back to the 19th century, when abolitionists “came out” of their churches in protest against slavery; for him, then, the idea of coming out meant non-participation in oppression, your own or that of others.)
An expert on human rights and social movements, McCarthy believes that the history of queer identity at Harvard mirrors that of America at large. He says that coming out has been an increasingly common form of queer political expression ever since the Stonewall rebellion of 1969, when a series of violent protests and demonstrations broke out in response to police raids of a bar frequented by LGBT people in the West Village. “To announce yourself as gay in a world that was homophobic was to hold people to account, as well as being a demand for acknowledgement,” the historian says.
After the great setbacks posed to the LGBT civil rights movement in the 1980s—above all, the AIDS epidemic and the policies of then president, Ronald Reagan—the 1990s proved to be a crucial decade in Cambridge, Mass., as indeed it was everywhere else. “It was ‘Culture War Central,’” recalls McCarthy. African American Studies and Women and Gender Studies were gaining more recognition as academic disciplines, and LGBT activism was gaining ever more attention.
In 1991, when McCarthy was a junior at the College, a new student publication called “The Peninsula” was inaugurated. The cover of its first issue featured an exploding pink triangle, and most of its 55 pages were devoted to what it called a “bad alternative” to heterosexuality. “These were just hideous articles,” McCarthy says. “They made you ask where the line is between violence and free speech.” The same day of its release, the word “faggot” was scrawled on a student’s door in Lowell House. The response was a rally on the steps of Widener Library, where a number of faculty members came out publicly for the first time—including the Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, Reverend Peter J. Gomes, whose announcement was met with cheers from the crowd. McCarthy was at the rally wearing a t-shirt that read “Straight but not Narrow.”
Nine years later, K. Kyriell Muhammad, a doctoral student in religion and an LGBT tutor in Mather House, left the College after his room was the target of repeated acts of homophobic vandalism. He finished his Ph.D. in the Bay Area. The Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender, and Supporters Alliance (BGLTSA), precursor to the QSA, responded actively. They argued that the administration had not dealt with the issue seriously enough, and they put posters about the effects of gay bullying all through the halls of Mather’s third floor.
Jonathan C. Page ’02, who was a freshman LGBT proctor and chaplain at Memorial Church until last year, remembers the furor over Muhammad’s departure. “At that stage, there was only one out male athlete,” Page says. The BGLTSA was small and socially driven and could take advantage of 18+ clubs such as Ramrod in Central Square. Upperclass housing had been randomized in 1998, so Adams House was no longer the hub of gay life, but queer culture still centered on a small group of students eager to maintain their community.
Now, however, Page thinks there is a false assumption about the ease of coming out—and a whole raft of new challenges for queer students on campus. “The great thing is that the student body is very accepting, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to come out,” Page says. “There’s an assumption that it’s no big deal, but how would you know?”
“When you’re in the closet, every comment that anyone makes is stored in the back of your head—and that person is immediately in your box of non-ally.”
Of course, the last two decades have seen great progressive changes. McCarthy is taking part in the BGLTQ student life working group commissioned by Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. “Here’s 16 people, including half of University Hall, and they’re all so passionate. That never would have happened while I was on campus [as a student],” McCarthy says. But in the wake of last fall’s string of LGBT tragedies, there is justification for a closer look. “That was like being hit one blow after another,” he recalls. “I was asking myself, ‘Are we still there?’”
So deeply personal are the trials of coming out, it is hard to get a grasp on where we are as a College. Harvard is a famously liberal environment, but here, misery tends to shy away from the spotlight. And McCarthy proclaims with some certainty that “at Harvard, a lot of queer people—perhaps even a majority—are not out.”
II. (RE)NEGOTIATION
Being at Harvard was “pivotal” for the coming out process of Andrew G. Brownjohn ’11, who came to college from a small rural town in upstate New York. In high school, Brownjohn remembers, “The word gay wasn’t associated with anything other than the insult. It wasn’t even an option I had at the time.”
Brownjohn’s prefrosh hosts were a group of seniors in Adams House, one of whom was in the Glee Club and threw a party that weekend. In the Glee Club, which Brownjohn joined when he came to Harvard, he found a community and began to meet openly gay people. “It took a while,” he says, “but it began to dawn on me that I’d been in denial about that part of myself for a long time.”
In the middle of freshman year, Brownjohn felt he might be ready to come out and told a friend from back home. “On finding out that I was gay, he said he didn’t want to be friends with me,” Brownjohn recalls. What followed was a period of real denial, covered up with commitments and distractions. “Being in the closet was not a good experience, because there was no true emotional support—and that was really alienating and painful,” Brownjohn says.
By the spring of sophomore year, however, Brownjohn began to feel more comfortable in his identity, and found affirmation in an unlikely place. While working his job at Lamont Library, he found he enjoyed shelving on Level B in the section labeled HQ: gender and family. Although he did not feel comfortable talking to other people about his questioning thoughts, he found he could open a dialogue with himself by reading books on the subject. Taking Associate English Professor Matthew B. Kaiser’s famous “Literature and Sexuality” class in junior fall was important for him as well. “The things he said about sexual orientation really made me comfortable with the idea that I am a homosexual,” recalls Brownjohn.
Brownjohn did not tell people until the end of junior spring. “Needing to be on the ball all the time for so many things, to have to talk to people about coming out ... I don’t know, I just put it on the backburner,” he says. At the end of that semester he had four final papers and four final exams in the course of two weeks; he spent so long at his desk that he had violent back spasms and had to go to University Health Services on suspicion of kidney stones. “I just realized that I was so stressed out and I’ve been keeping this thing in—and I couldn’t do it anymore,” Brownjohn says of his secret.
When his ultrasound turned out clear, he told his openly bisexual friend from freshman year and then worked to tell as many people in person as he could. Brownjohn kept a list of the first people he told, and thinks he still has it somewhere. His parents told him they loved him no matter what. “It could be biased,” Brownjohn says, “but I felt surrounded by so many people that were a good role model for what I was and wanted to become.” Thanks to this support, he beams, “I’m just comfortable in who I am and in telling people that.”
One person Brownjohn singles out as a source of inspiration is Marco Chan, who in addition to being co-chair of the QSA is tour manager of the Glee Club. Chan has been openly gay since before he applied to college, but he insists that coming out is an ongoing process with ongoing difficulties. “Even if you’re generally out, there are constantly moments of renegotiation,” he says. Each new class, each new group of friends necessitates coming out again—if you decide you want to, that is. One of the most visible members of the queer community at Harvard, Chan chose not to mention his sexuality when on exchange in South America, and he sometimes takes the QSA signature off his e-mail address when organizing the Glee Club’s Spring Tour. “I mean, I’m dealing with churches in the South and I can’t assume,” he explains.
Chan believes that Harvard is generally a reassuring place at which to come out. “Harvard as an administration is incredibly supportive of individuals at every stage of the process,” he says. Yet he admits that there are significant complications. “It’s sometimes difficult to find a space if you only want to be out to some and not others,” Chan says. Because of the QSA’s very public image, people first need to be at a certain comfort level before they will be seen in an LGBT space. “I really don’t know what to do about that,” Chan muses, distracted. “I can’t exactly throw an ‘I’m-not-really-out’ party.”
He knows that many queer students come out but don’t want to be associated with the QSA because they think it’s too flamboyant, too hedonistic. This is inaccurate as well as hypocritical, according to Chan. “That is a very narrow vision of what we do and who we are,” he argues. “And anyway, these people would be asking for tolerance and space while denying that to someone else. People live their LGBT life in different ways: some folks can’t be out, some folks want a limited involvement, and some folks are running around, draping the rainbow flag on the John Harvard statue. We’re the whole spectrum.”
Tim McCarthy believes that much of the coming out process is learning to resist the pressures of the outside world. “There’s a pervasive stigma in society that we grow up with, even in the most liberal of places, and we all internalize that,” he says. “When you hate who you are because you live in a society that tells you to hate who you are, learning to love yourself fully can be a very difficult process.”
It is a complicated issue, McCarthy insists. “That’s why I love studying the humanities,” he exclaims. “Because I know that people are complicated.”
Harvard is a very tolerant place, he agrees, but it also prizes a degree of confidence in people. “When you’ve always got to be a success, well, identity is far more complicated than that,” McCarthy says. “Among queer people, there can be a feeling that coming out entails a kind of vulnerability—and that’s potentially destabilizing in their lives, especially where people are so afraid of being vulnerable.” Everything at Harvard is competitive and exclusive, McCarthy opines, even his public service spring break trip. Students tend to move towards archetypes to find support and acceptance in certain communities. “Harvard is a place where we have a parade of façades,” says the lecturer. “I spent a lot of time here as an undergrad building up those façades, but I think we’re more interesting and complicated and worthy of love if we cast them aside.”
III. IN GROUP, OUT GROUP
 
After he came out, McCarthy found that he was frequently asked for advice by others who were questioning. The personal process of coming out became political and relational in a way he never expected. “Being out for me is no longer: ‘Can I endure?’ Being out for me is more: ‘Can I change the world enough so these young kids don’t have to go through what I went through?’” He says that a lot of the undergraduates who come to him are those who can relate to him—particularly athletes, ethnic minorities, and students from religious or working-class backgrounds. “If you go through life, like I did, thinking there’s no one like you and then there’s this new aspect to you, well, that’s a really disorienting experience,” McCarthy says.  “I want to be as out and visible as I can so young people know there is someone out there like them.”
When Miguel Garcia ’12 came to Harvard from Detroit, Mich., he found it hard to settle in. “I’m the first male in my family to ever graduate from high school, so it was really difficult to transition into this environment where it’s hard to find similar people,” he explains. He says that resources were not easily accessible in the communities he associated with. Later, Garcia co-founded “Gay, Lesbian, or, Whatever” (GLOW), an organization that aims to address the interconnected experiences of underrepresented and marginalized identities. “The main focus is the confidential safe space that we provide,” Garcia says. “When I was coming out, I think what I really needed was to have a supportive environment where people could just be honest about their situation.”
Garcia never expected that he would become an advocate in the queer community. “My main goal was to have friends that understood and a place where I didn’t feel like I had to be someone I wasn’t,” he says. The quest for that support structure led Garcia and his friends to establish GLOW, a group with a mandate vastly different from that of the QSA. “Although the QSA’s board is very diverse in terms of ethnicity and race, the interests and discussions were pretty much dominated by the membership—and that means white American males,” Garcia explains. “I do think that if you’re someone who has an identity that’s significantly different than that of a mainstream queer on campus, it is difficult to find support groups.”
GLOW does not ask its members or guests to identify in terms of ethnicity, race, religion or sexuality. Yet Garcia believes strongly in providing channels for queer students to come out in a space where they feel a cultural connection. He explains that different communities can face different challenges. “The Latino culture is strongly Catholic so it’s really affirming to speak to people that were raised in the same faith and struggled with those same cultural issues,” Garcia says. “Black communities are very family-oriented and supportive because of the history of this nation. There’s a strong sentiment in the QSA community that we should reject our families if they don’t accept us, but that’s very difficult when all your protection against racism comes in the family.”
Garcia is also proud of GLOW’s insistence on confidentiality, protecting its many members who do not yet feel ready to come out. Usually, organizations need to release membership lists to the university if they want official recognition and funding, but GLOW was able to bypass the requirement in order to preserve the safe space. “There are a few people like myself who are out and proud but the majority of people want to keep all these issues private,” he says. “Sometimes you just want people to listen and understand instead of being an ambassador.” But that’s not to say there isn’t room for both. In mid-February, the QSA and GLOW co-sponsored an event on race in comedy; Garcia reports that it was a success and says he is glad that the two organizations work well in tandem. “I think that the challenge is to be able to have our individual affinity groups but still rally up together when it’s needed,” he says.
Although he was hesitant to join at first, Garcia was pleasantly surprised by the passion and concern he has observed as a member of the BGLTQ student life working group—particularly by the frankness of members like Tim McCarthy, one of GLOW’s co-faculty advisors. “One time, in the middle of a discussion about the importance of accessible mental health resources, he just said, ‘Wait, what about dating and sex—isn’t that important to everyone?’ I’m really happy we have a team of people like Tim who can honestly talk about all the important aspects of student life,” Garcia laughs.
Garcia is unsmiling, however, when it comes to the way the administration deals with crises on campus. He feels that LGBT issues are treated less earnestly because they are seen as political; he also believes that individual tragedies are too lightly medicalized and dismissed. “GLOW and other support groups have largely emerged from student knowledge of suicide attempts on campus,” Garcia says, counting four stories of serious suicidal episodes that were shared within his private circles. “Though these experiences are not acknowledged or addressed, many of us are well aware of the harsh realities that LGBTQ students of color on campus often face.” There are encouraging manifestations of concern, he says, but denial seems to be part of the greater Harvard culture. “I just wish people would realize that Harvard is not the easiest place for everyone to be, even if they’re not queer, you know?”
IV. THE L WORD
“Yeah, the lesbians are all really spread out,” drawls Elizabeth C. Elrod ’11. “A lot of girls come to me and say, ‘I can’t find any other lesbians.’” Elrod herself does not have trouble finding other lesbians: she doesn’t have a girlfriend, she says, but she has a Valentine. This evokes guffaws and a cry of “playa” from her friends around the table in Eliot d-hall. She explains the merits of traveling to other colleges in the area, with one particular standout. “MIT,” she declares, relishing the element of surprise. “Oh, yes, MIT lesbians are very pretty.”
But at first, Elrod says, it can be hard to come to terms with your identity when that identity is not so publicly validated. “It’s hard to come out when you feel like just one person rather than a group of people,” she says. The lesbian community is not particularly visible: when it unites, it does so to go to lesbian bars or to watch “The L Word”—and those things get little exposure on campus. Girlspot and the QSA are working hard to reach out to girls, as is the Women’s Center, but Elrod is sure that “there’s no one place where you know that all the gay girls hang out.”
Elrod had trouble at home when she first came out, but found support in the novice coach of her crew team and in the older lesbian girls that she had met. “It also helped that I was in a relationship at the time,” she remembers, “because I knew obviously I’m super gay.” Even so, says Elrod, “it was a lot of hardship that went on in March of freshman year: I was unbuilding a foundation, so it was a huge upset, the whole coming out process.”
Now, Elrod is out and proud. “Whenever I go to gay clubs and there are guys making out and girls making out, I think it’s so awesome,” she gushes. Often younger girls are referred to her for advice. “I don’t know how much help I can give them, I mean, I’m no expert,” Elrod says. “But it definitely makes the community stronger that way, being self-supported.” She certainly seems to have overcome any doubts. “I remember how I used to wait for a trusting, non-judgmental situation before I told someone,” she muses. “Now I’ve reached a stage where I’m so open and blunt about how much I love a good pair of boobs that no one ever has any doubt.”
Naturally, there are moments when mainstream Harvard culture clashes with Elrod’s identity. “I love the guys from the Fox,” she laughs, “but there was one moment I was there and I suddenly thought, ‘Oh, God, one person here’s not like the others—and it’s me!” She will grind with a friend, she declares, but finds it off-putting when she is expected to do so as performance. A chorus of eager nods circles around the table.
When Elrod came out to her mother at the end of freshman year, it went badly and ended in her mother accusing Harvard of being a “lesbian breeding ground.” Now, Elrod says, she and her mom are moving towards an understanding. “The last time we talked on the phone, she said, ‘If you’re going to marry a woman like you say you want to, then at least she better be a good Christian woman.’ I still wouldn’t say she’s, like, a cool mom—but we’re getting there.”
V. IT GETS BETTER?
Susan B. Marine thinks that we don’t talk about sex enough. As assistant dean of student life, director of the Harvard College Women’s Center, and a member of the BGLTQ working group, Marine has been deeply involved in issues of sexuality and gender identity ever since she arrived on campus in 2002. At other colleges there is usually some kind of sex week, she notes, but Harvard students have not managed to organize anything similar. She also regrets the demise of the popular core course “Psychology 1703: Human Sexuality” in 2006. “It’s a lot easier for people to come out if there’s a sustained dialogue about romance and dating and sex,” says Marine. “People don’t know how or when to come out when the people around them all seem to be completely asexual.” The pressures of mainstream Harvard culture cast a long shadow, too, she adds: between professional aims, networking, and social clubs, sexuality often just doesn’t get prioritized.
Kevin R. thinks he usually doesn’t see the people who don’t talk about sex. When he goes out on the weekend, he says, “It’s over-sexed if anything.” He hasn’t heard of WGS (Women and Gender Studies), but he admits that the Saturday night ritual he experiences is designed for straight people. “That’s an America thing, I think,” he explains. “The culture itself is heterosexist. I mean, if you know how to dress here, people think you’re gay. But Harvard’s no different to any other college in the US, and everyone seems to be pretty cool about the whole thing.”
When Kevin told a close friend a few weeks ago, she gushed that he could now be her GBFF: her Gay Best Friend Forever. “I told her, no, I would be her best friend that happened to be gay. I don’t want it to personify me,” he says. “You shouldn’t have to announce it to the world, it should just be whatever.” Kevin looks determined as he describes the reaction of his two best friends at home. One of them reacted well. “When I told him, he said this thing that was really powerful, I would say manly. He said, ‘Even I have questioned my sexuality at times.’” The other one is no longer a friend. “He kept saying to me, ‘It’s your choice, it’s your choice,’” Kevin remembers. “That’s just so ignorant; it’s not a choice. I’ve spent most of my life wishing I wasn’t this way, but I am and now I’ve come to terms with that—and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Kevin and his current roommate have not talked about his sexuality since their first conversation on the topic. “He says he’s totally OK with it, but it’s still just weird,” he says.
Tim McCarthy sits in his office surrounded by photos and books. “I believe the arc of the universe bends towards the better but only if we bend it,” he says. The advances in social justice for black Americans in the 60s and 70s didn’t just happen: they were because of the Civil Rights Movement. “Your generation has a real opportunity to start talking seriously about how to mobilize allies,” McCarthy says of those currently in the College. “It’s all about subtle things: not making or allowing others to make hetero-normative or gender-normative assumptions.” He adds that the queer community should be doing a much better job as allies for transgender people.
McCarthy considers himself an ally in the black social justice movement: “Being an ally means stepping up but it also means stepping back and being humble. When it comes to racial justice, I’m more of a foot soldier than a leader,” he says. For McCarthy, this means taking the risk to challenge prejudice when it appears in the private sphere. “People say crazy shit to me all the time about black people, but being an ally means calling them on it,” says McCarthy. “And you get called things, you get not invited back to dinner, you make parties awkward sometimes. But you have to challenge people on their bullshit. And those moments when I didn’t step up, when I stayed silent in the face of prejudice, those are moments I remember—and they haunt me.”
When K. Kyriell Muhammad was being bullied out of the College in 2001, the Mather House community replied with what was called the “Mather House Creed.” The House Committee did not respond publicly to the incident, member Andrea Volfa ’00 told The Crimson. The document hung in the dining room with 300 signatures beneath it, in a House of around 400. Its first words were “We live here together.” It wasn’t enough to keep the tutor, but it was at least a good place to start.
Shortly after he left, Muhammad wrote in this magazine that he responded so extremely because he had always felt so close to Mather’s students: “I felt betrayed by people with whom I thought I had created some sort of social contract. That I was here for them, that I would treat them with respect and dignity and a certain amount of compassion and care. And in return, they would do much the same. Out of all the emotions that swept through me out of that period, I think the betrayal part was the worst.”
His final words to the Mather community, written in an e-mail to all House residents, were these: “I wish you all well, individually and communally, and urge you to hold fast to your principles, however lofty and unattainable they may seem.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Doritos and corn chips turned into objects of historical study yesterday in the new General Education course United States in the World 30: “Tangible Things: Harvard Collections in World History.”
After teaching fellows distributed chips to the roughly 300 students in the audience, history professor Laurel T. Ulrich and senior lecturer Ivan Gaskell, who co-teach the course, instructed students to write down observations about the chips they held in their hands.
“It’s not about being clever about things,” Gaskell said to the students. “It’s just observing it.”
Five minutes later, students raised their hands to share their observations, which ranged from “bumpy, three millimeters thick, and heterogeneous” to “coarse with black spots.”
Gaskell said this and other exercises, including a scavenger hunt through Harvard’s museums, reflect the course’s goal of introducing students to object-based history, which is the study of history through the observation of artifacts.
“These things encourage students to look carefully, to observe, to see something with as fresh [of] eyes as they can, something that most students will have put in their mouths a hundred times or more, and yet not necessarily thought about,” he said.
The course was developed to offer students a broader way of studying history, Gaskell added.
“Historians learn how to read texts and bring a sophisticated eye to that, but [students] don’t learn how to use these other traces of the past,” he said.
The course is closely connected with an exhibit that shares its name with that of the course. The exhibit is located in the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments in the Science Center.
The course has also placed historical artifacts related to the course in seven different collections around campus.
Gaskell said he thinks the installations are on an unprecedented scale for an undergraduate course.
“Of course there have been projects and exhibitions in which collections lend to each other, but not to the extent that we have done,” he said.
Ulrich, one of 23 professors to have received the distinctive University professorship, said she hopes the connection between the course and the exhibits will encourage students to explore Harvard’s museums.
“I don’t want anybody to graduate without having discovered these resources,” she said. “And nobody will get through this course without discovering those museums.”
Alan Silva ’13, a student in the course, echoed Ulrich’s sentiment.
“The class really emphasizes how lucky we are to have all these wonderful things in our collections,” he said.
However, one senior, who requested anonymity to avoid jeopardizing her grade, said she was disappointed by the class.
“It’s not what I expected,” she said. “I expected it to be more related to Harvard’s collections and the general history behind them.”
Gaskell said he was not surprised by mixed student reaction to the course.
“I think there’s a certain strand of bewilderment to studying objects in this way,” he said.

Harvard Law School reduced emissions of greenhouse gases by 19.1 percent in the fiscal year ending June 30, according to the Harvard University Office for Sustainability.
The reductions are in accordance with a 2008 pact among Harvard President Drew G. Faust and the deans of the various Harvard schools to cut emissions by 30 percent by 2016.
So far in FY 2011, the Law School has used five percent less energy than at the same point in FY 2010, and 27.7 percent less than in the first six months of FY 2009.
During FY 2010, the College reduced emissions by 23 percent, the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences reduced emissions by 26 percent, and the Harvard College Library system made reductions of 17.6 percent.
The Law School reductions from FY 2010 are equivalent to taking 189 passenger vehicles off of the road, according to a Law School press release.
Forty percent of the reductions at the Law School were the result of individual conservation efforts, such as turning off electronics during breaks, curtailing dorm temperatures to save energy during the summer and winter, and starting student programs to raise awareness for the conservation effort, according to numbers released by the Office for Sustainability.
The other 60 percent of the reductions were the result of energy saving projects, such as making buildings more energy-efficient by installing more efficient lighting and automation upgrades in buildings.
Kathryn Cosgrove, the Sustainability Coordinator for the Law School who works jointly with the University’s Office for Sustainability, said that she was surprised to see the high percentage attributed to individual student efforts.
She added that their effectiveness demonstrates that individual efforts—even those actions that seem small—can make a big difference.
Stephanie E. Young, a third year at the Law School and a green representative for North Hall, said that students can continue to play a part through daily actions as simple as turning off lights. Young said that the green representatives initiate programming to help conserve, such as a partnership with the Law School library that allows Law School students to rent bicycles through the Hollis library system.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of panelists agreed that a unified vision and a tireless approach would be needed to close the nationwide “achievement gap”—a disparity between the test scores of underrepresented minority students and their white and Asian counterparts—at a discussion last night in Emerson Hall.
The panel, hosted by the Harvard Students for Education Reform and Teach for America, featured a range of professionals in the field of education, including Ronald F. Ferguson, the director of Harvard’s Achievement Gap Initiative.
According to Ferguson, scholarship on the achievement gap first rose to prominence in the 1990s. While there has been some progress at the elementary school level over the past two decades, the achievement gap in high schools has failed to improve, he said.
Ferguson also noted that the gap develops rapidly as young minority students approach kindergarten.
Though there is “not much of a gap” around the first birthday, a divergence in test scores is already apparent by age three, he said.
Ferguson added that the achievement disparity is not necessarily consistent as students age, implying that cultural influences play a major role in student achievement.
“These differences are not written in stone,” he concluded.
Panelist Caroll Blake, executive director for the Achievement Gap Department of Boston Public Schools, said that poor performance is especially evident among African American and Latino males.
Programs aimed at bridging the gap should target these demographics in a manner that is “intentional,” she said.
While the panelists agreed that different approaches could be effective in addressing the disparity, there was a consensus that planning, clarity and relentlessness in structuring the reform system are all essential.
“There is not one right way of doing it; it just has to be coherent,” Ferguson said.
“Teaching ... is not a nine-to-five job. It has to be something that you are committed to,” Blake added.
After the panel concluded, Ferguson emphasized that closing the achievement gap should be considered a national effort.
“No matter what your career track is, there are ways that you can teach and inspire,” he said.
Francheska Dominique ’11, who will with TFA next year, said that she hopes to see stronger efforts across campus to address racial disparities in education.
Noting that teaching is not the only way to get involved, she added, “We [also] need people reading the data and telling us what to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two student groups at the Harvard Law School—the Harvard Immigration Project (HIP) and the Labor and Employment Action Project (LEAP)—are organizing a boycott of The Upper Crust Pizzeria in response to allegations filed in court that claim that the local pizza chain violated labor laws.
Two separate lawsuits filed against Upper Crust in court allege that the company inappropriately demanded repayment of back wages for unpaid overtime, paid workers less than the minimum wage, and fired them unduly.
“It’s mostly just to send a message that we don’t support companies that treat their workers this way and aren’t compliant with labor and employment laws,” said Claire S. Valentin, who is a third-year student at the Law School and president of the Harvard Immigration Project.
Valentin added that, although student groups at the Law School usually order Upper Crust pizza for events, she and other participants have decided to cease their patronage of the company during the legal proceedings.
“We just don’t feel it’s appropriate for student groups to be buying as much pizza as we tend to be buying from them here,” she said.
David Berman, who is Upper Crust’s attorney, said he refutes the plaintiffs’ claims.
“There is no merit whatsoever to any allegation that Upper Crust has deprived any employee of benefits to which that employee was rightfully entitled,” he said. “And if we have to go through a very long proceeding to prove otherwise, we will go through a very long proceeding to prove otherwise.”
Berman added that he is unconcerned about the student boycott.
“I’m not really scared of a boycott, frankly,” he said. “Most of the time the people who end up boycotting you are the ones who didn’t patronize you anyway.”
Valentin said that HIP first conceived of the idea of boycotting Upper Crust after reading the Dec. 5 Boston Globe article about the lawsuits.
“We decided as a group not to continue ordering from Upper Crust,” she said. “Then when we came back for the semester we thought we would do more advocacy work and see if we could get other groups involved.”
HIP and LEAP have already gained the backing of about 40 student groups at the Law School. An organization at the Medical School and the undergraduate group Act on a Dream have also pledged their support.
The organizers of the boycott said they hope to solicit support from more undergraduate student organizations in the next two weeks.
“We were really pleased with the number of groups that have supported us,” Valentin said.
Although the organizers of the boycott have not yet met with representatives from Upper Crust, they plan to send a letter to the local pizza chain after they gain sufficient support across the University.
David J. Casserly, who is Vice President of Advocacy of LEAP, said the boycott will continue until Upper Crust provides them with proof of compliance with employment laws.
“We’d at least require them to show us the certification that the Department of Labor gives them” to show that they are in compliance, he said. “Until that happens, we’re probably going to keep going forward with the boycott.”

CORRECTION: FEB. 24, 2011
The Feb. 24 article "Students Boycott Upper Crust" misquoted Claire S. Valentin. She did not say that the campaign is a response to counter companies that "cheat" their employees; rather, it is a response to those who "treat" their employees in a way that violates "labor and employment laws."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Barney Frank ’61 shared his opinions on topics ranging from government spending to gay rights in a speech punctuated by light-heartedness last night in the Winthrop Junior Common Room.
Frank, a past resident of Winthrop House and the current House Representative for Massachusetts’s 4th congressional district, called the U.S.’s current spending “hypocritical.”
According to Frank, the excessive military spending—which he said does not always successfully achieve its goal of increasing U.S. security—has crippled the government’s ability to scale back debt and invest money in other important areas.
For example, Frank cited the approximately 10,000 non-combat troops currently stationed in Iraq and the $10 million cost that he said they incur.
“Why are we doing this?” he asked. “Bring them home.”
Frank identified the subsidization of Brazilian cotton—an effort to protect American cotton growers that he said drains approximately $150 million per year—as another source of unnecessary spending.
He added that he felt the government’s priority should not be tax cuts.
“I have never seen a tax cut put out a fire,” Frank said. “There are things that are absolutely essential to us that we can only do if we come together and pay taxes.”
Frank, who became the second openly gay member of the House of Representatives in 1987, also spoke about his support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights.
Frank voiced his support for the return of the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps at Harvard, despite concerns from students and activists about a policy barring transgender individuals from military service.
“I would reinstate ROTC at Harvard,” he said. “If you hold out on perfection, your ability to achieve full success diminishes.”
Frank also discussed Obama’s recent decision to stop supporting the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act—a bill which banned federal recognition of same-sex marriages—attributing the reversal to greater public attention to the details of the act.
“It’s one thing to defend the Defense of Marriage Act when [there is] a low level of scrutiny,” Frank said. “It’s another to go to the heightened level of scrutiny and [still] say that the Defense of Marriage Act is constitutional.”
Frank said he was optimistic about the significant progress in LGBT rights since his undergraduate years.
“When I was at Harvard, I didn’t know any gay people. None of us told each other that we were gay,” Frank said. “[Obama’s recent reversal] is a sign ... that the fight for legal equality for lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgenders is on the verge of being won more quickly than I thought.”

Children’s Hospital Boston, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School, stands to lose $21 million in funding for the training of new pediatricians if President Obama’s tightened budget proposal passes in Congress for the 2012 fiscal year.
The proposal, released earlier this month, cuts a $317.5 million government program that funds the training of 40 percent of future pediatricians across the nation.
While non-pediatric training programs receive federal funds through Medicare, graduate training at children’s hospitals has traditionally received funds through the Children’s Hospitals Graduate Medical Education program.
Children’s Hospital Boston has the largest graduate training program in the country, according to Josh Greenberg, the hospital’s vice president for government relations.
He said that it is too early to tell the outcome of the federal budget and its impact on the hospital.
“If we have to cut portions of the training program, we’ll have to make hard choices,” he said.
Congress has been locked in a battle over the budget for the past two weeks, opening the possibility for a government shutdown.
In an e-mailed statement to The Crimson, Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry said that he has been in contact with Children’s Hospital and is currently looking for alternative items to cut from the budget.
“Cutting Children’s Hospital Boston is just vexing,” Kerry said in the e-mail. “This hospital has the largest graduate medical education program in the country and I don’t know why you’d risk our hospitals’ ability to train more than one-third of our nation’s pediatricians when we’re already facing serious national shortages in pediatric subspecialties.”
Kerry said that he was working with Senator Robert P. Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania on a bill to reauthorize and fund Children’s Hospital Boston’s training program before it expires at the end of September.
Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown could not be reached for comment.
Greenberg said that he and officials representing the National Association of Children’s Hospitals have been in talks with members of both Houses of Congress.
“We need to be in a conversation with the House and the Senate as to the importance of this program,” Greenberg said. “One thing that’s working for us is that it’s always been seen as a bipartisan program.”
NACH President Lawrence McAndrews expressed concern that the potential cuts could slow the addition of new doctors to an already underpopulated workforce.
“The proposed elimination of the CHGME program would have a dramatic negative effect on the pediatric workforce pipeline at a time when children’s timely access to pediatric care is already impaired,” he said.

Still $35 million in the red, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences has maintained a restriction on the hiring of visiting professors, instead favoring the use of less expensive post-doctoral students to fill teaching positions.
But department administrators say the partial hiring freeze has affected their curricula, leading to the downsizing of certain specialized areas of instruction that are typically taught by tenure-track faculty.
“We aren’t offering fields because we don’t have visiting lecturers,” said History of Art and Architecture Department Administrator Deanna Dalrymple. “It’s a visiting lecturer that typically teaches a certain field or topic when we think there is a perhaps a deficiency in our curriculum. We don’t currently have that capability.”
For the past two years, FAS has cut costs by hiring the comparatively cheaper teaching fellows through the newly-established College Fellows Program, which helps provide one-year teaching opportunities for Harvard graduate students entering a difficult job market.
The Government Department currently has three college fellows and plans to keep the number the same in the next academic year, according to Government Department Chair Timothy J. Colton.
The number of college fellow hires has fallen short of the numbers needed to cover the vacancies of professors on sabbatical, department administrators said.
There has been a tangible decrease in the number of lecturers in the Psychology Department over the past four years, according to Department Chair Susan E. Carey ’64.
“We are definitely influenced by the budget deficit,” she said.
And with more professors opting to take the FAS retirement package offered last fall to faculty over 65, administrators questioned whether they might have enough resources to plug the hole created by retiring tenured professors.
For example, although there is a greater number of lecturers in the Psychology Department this year, the increase can be attributed to a rise in the number of professors leaving their posts, said Undergraduate Advising Administrator Laura L. Chivers.
Not every department has completely frozen the hiring of visiting professors. The Economics Department, for instance, saw the number of visiting professors increase last year, which contributed to the resurrection of junior seminars in that department.
“I know [hiring visiting professors] has been harder, but obviously that doesn’t affect me because I am here,” said George-Marios Angeletos, a visiting professor of economics from MIT.

Information on the outcomes of disciplinary cases heard in recent years by the College’s Administrative Board—originally slated for release by the end of the fall semester—is still in the process of being compiled and reviewed, according to Secretary of the Ad Board John “Jay” L. Ellison.
In September 2010, the College hired a management fellow to collect data on the decisions made by the College’s top disciplinary body, which is often perceived by students as secretive.
Ellison said that this information, which will be made available online once it has been reviewed, will include descriptions of past cases in addition to graphs charting the Ad Board’s recent work. The data is intended to help students—especially those facing a Ad Board case—better understand the process.
“I think that transparency is very important in that it gives students an idea as to where they stand,” said Megan R. Mitrovich, the management fellow responsible for compiling the data.
She predicted that the information will be released by the end of this semester.
“We could do the stats immediately, but they actually don’t tell you why one person got one sanction, why one person got another,” Ellison said.
According to Ellison, the release has been delayed primarily due to privacy concerns. He emphasized the importance of obscuring details that could link current or former students to specific incidents.
“We have to be very, very careful to provide students with enough information that they know what the board’s doing and they know how the board responds to things, but make sure that the information is carefully crafted so that the individual students are not identified,” Ellison said.
To address this potential problem, Ellison said that he and Mitrovich decided to expand the time frame covered by the data beyond the five-year period originally planned in order to make it harder to identify individual students.
“With cases that are rare and particularly difficult—sexual assault cases, for example—we’re actually going to go back most likely ten years,” he said.
In addition to compiling the statistics on the Ad Board, Mitrovich is also working on the academic integrity assessment that the College is currently conducting. The first step of this process is a survey sent via e-mail Feb. 7 to all students, teaching fellows, and faculty; the survey will close to students at midnight on Monday, Feb. 28.

UPDATE Feb. 25: Early Action To Return in Fall
Harvard announced today that its non-binding early action admissions program will return this fall for the Class of 2016.
 The program, which was eliminated in 2007 due to concerns that it posed a disadvantage to low-income applicants, will prohibit students from applying early to other schools, while being non-binding.
 In a statement, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said that offering an accelerated decision cycle for interested applicants will increase Harvard’s potential to attract top-caliber students.
 “We looked carefully at trends in Harvard admissions these past years and saw that many highly talented students, including some of the best-prepared low-income and underrepresented minority students, were choosing programs with an early-action option, and therefore were missing out on the opportunity to consider Harvard,” he said.
In 2006, Harvard University, Princeton University, and the University of Virginia made headlines by announcing within weeks of each other that early admissions practices at their schools would end.
Less than two hours after Harvard revealed its plan to resume early admissions this morning, Princeton also announced its plans to restore the early admissions program. Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman said in a statement that she believed that bringing back an early program would allow her school to better recruit underrepresented groups.
"By reinstating an early program, we hope we can achieve two goals: provide opportunities for early application for students who know that Princeton is their first choice, while at the same time sustaining and even enhancing the progress we have made in recent years in diversifying our applicant pool," she said in the statement.
The University of Virginia had already rolled out an early action program this past November.
Harvard President Drew G. Faust said in a statement that the return of early action is now “consistent with our bedrock commitment to access, affordability, and excellence.”
Harvard has been reevaluating its decision to move to a single admissions cycle since early this academic year. In November, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said in an interview with The Crimson that he did not expect any changes to the current program, but he added that "we’re a dynamic institution.”
While in 2006 Fitzsimmons heralded the single admissions notification date as “a win for students in the bottom quarter and bottom half of the income distribution,” earlier this month, he classified the move as an “experiment.”
When the College first removed early action admissions, then-Interim University President Derek C. Bok criticized the early round.
"We feel that if anybody is going to step up and take the lead to try to get rid of something which is really doing more harm than good in high schools across the country, it’s us,” Bok had said.
Harvard also said that it will add other recruiting programs in order to encourage greater transparency in college admissions and increase undergraduate involvement in the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative, the Undergraduate Minority Recruitment Program, and “Return to High School Program”—existing endeavors which aim to heighten interest in Harvard among students of diverse backgrounds.

Harvard College tuition and fees will climb 3.8 percent for the next academic year, reaching a total cost of $52,650.
The jump in price will be coupled with a $2 million increase in the financial aid budget, bringing the total cost of financial aid to a record high of more than $160 million.
Already, more than 60 percent of Harvard undergraduates receive some financial aid from the College.
At the same time that the College announced next year’s tuition price, it revealed plans to bring back the early action admissions program which it cut four years ago out of concerns that it disadvantaged low-income students. Today’s announcement affirmed, however, that the Harvard Financial Aid Initiative—another hallmark of the Office of Admissions and Financial Aid’s push to increase college accessibility and affordability—remains on solid ground for the next year.
Under the financial aid initiative, families that earn less than $60,000 per year pay no tuition to send students to Harvard. Students whose families earn up to $180,000 are typically asked to pay no more than 10 percent of the family’s income.
The percent increase in tuition matches last year’s increase exactly.

House Majority Leader Eric I. Cantor (R-Va.) spoke about recently proposed cuts to the federal budget last night, filling the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum at the Institute of Politics and drawing hundreds of protesters to the surrounding streets.
In his remarks, Cantor said that the United States currently stands at a crossroads between a society dependent on government programs and one focused on cultivating private entrepreneurship.
“Before us is a choice that is a definitional choice about who we want to be as a country,” Cantor said. “In order to protect our way of life, the choice we must make is about changing course and renewing our commitment to reform and to focus on growing the things that make America unique.”
Cantor pointed to American innovation as pivotal to economic prosperity and said that investments in the private sector, rather than government-sponsored programs, are the way to provide financial security to the next generation of Americans.
“We are becoming a country more concerned about government-sponsored financial security than individually driven opportunity. That to me threatens the American ideal,” Cantor said.
He compared the situation in the United States—where he said that citizens have demanded “an end to the explosive growth of government”—to that in Europe, where recent protests by young people about cutbacks in retirement benefits proved that French citizens have been “conditioned” to depend on their government for their future financial security, he said.
Cantor warned that if Washington does not make balancing the budget a priority, it will cause an eroding value of the dollar, an acceleration in inflation, and ultimately a lower standard of living for all Americans.
The first question of the night showed that several of the groups protesting outside were also willing to directly confront Cantor.
A College student supporting the Harvard College Global Health and AIDS Coalition asked whether Cantor would “save a million lives” by stopping the cuts to global health programs.
Students around the room then stood in solidarity, waving banners and chanting, “Budget cuts kill. Fund global health.” The students then continued their protest by walking out of the event.
A later question on the recent proposed cuts to the AmeriCorps program—which funds programs like Teach for America and Habitat for Humanity—was followed by a round of enthusiastic applause from the audience.
Cantor responded to questions about fiscal cuts by emphasizing the need to make difficult decisions in the struggle to balance the federal budget.
“We’re going to have to make some choices,” Cantor said. “There are plenty of federal programs whose mission is laudable.”
Some questions addressed ongoing political issues besides the budget.
In response to a question about President Obama’s recent announcement that his administration will not defend the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman, Cantor said that he was “taken aback” because he had never seen a President decline to defend a law on the books.
Cantor said that he would stand by his record in support of traditional marriage. ­
“It is contrary to the fact that we are a nation of laws,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From an outside perspective, Saturday night’s women’s basketball game was just another event for breast cancer awareness. Lavietes Pavilion was clad in hues of pink—from shirts to laces to the referees’ whistles—for the fourth annual Pink Zone game. But for those familiar with the story of Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith, including the numerous alumni in the bleachers, this weekend held much more meaning.
Boasting a near-30-year tenure at the helm of the Crimson’s basketball program, Delaney-Smith has seen it all on the court, but she never saw what was coming 11 years ago. That year, on what seemed to be a normal December day, Delaney-Smith was getting a regular physical when she was diagnosed with breast cancer.
“I had been very healthy up to that point,” Delaney-Smith says. “I was shocked—[my family and I] were all shocked. I didn’t really know anyone prior to my diagnosis who had breast cancer, so I felt I was not informed. It was pretty scary.”
At first, Delaney-Smith wanted to keep her diagnosis within the family. She felt that she could handle it privately without worrying everyone around her, including the 1999-2000 women’s basketball team. But the coach had a change of heart.
FACING THE CRIMSON
Once her doctor told her that she could continue coaching, Delaney-Smith decided to tell the squad about the new development, especially since she would need to coordinate her treatment around Harvard’s regular-season schedule.
“Telling the team was really difficult,” Delaney-Smith remembers. “It was an emotional thing, because I’m sure if I were 18 and this person in my life that I see everyday told me that they had cancer, it would be kind of shocking.”
“We could not even imagine what she was going through,” says team member and co-captain of the 2001-2002 squad Laura Barnard ’02. “She stated from the onset that she was going to do everything she could to be at every practice and at every game. I think she maybe missed one practice and one game, if any at all.”
Delaney-Smith did not wait long to start chemotherapy treatment. Fortunately, winter break was near, so she planned her surgery and initial treatments during the holidays. But because of the future doses of radiation involved with chemotherapy, Delaney-Smith knew that soon she would start showing physical signs of her condition.
HARVARD HAIR SALON
Knowing that she was going to lose her hair, Delaney-Smith decided to take the initiative so her team would not be shocked to see her bald after the break.
“She was like, ‘That’s it, I’m going to cut my hair off.’ She was proactive about it and said, ‘My hair does not define me,’” Barnard recounts. “She had a session where one of our players actually cut off her hair for her. She was like, ‘Cut it really, really short,’ because she knew it was all going to ultimately fall off.”
For the rest of the season, Delaney-Smith often messed around with her wig, twisting it, turning it, or using it as a prop to liven the atmosphere. It was her way of showing the team that she was still the same old coach, and that she had no qualms about fighting this cancer.
“One day, all of the other coaches came in with wigs on—Kathy was all about using humor to deal with everything,” says former Crimson player Sharon Moore ’02. “That’s the way she lives her life. She applied it on the court, she applied it to her life dealing with cancer, and that’s the way that everybody else got through it too.”
The team also had a way of showing its coach that the squad cared about her.
“Actually, a couple of our players cut their hair,” Barnard recalls. “We had a player, Courtney [Egelhoff ’00], and she had long, red hair flowing below her shoulder before she chopped it off to about one-inch length in recognition of our coach and what she was going through.”
THE NEXT STEP
“All of the good news you can get [about breast cancer] I had,” Delaney-Smith says. “It was a slow-growing cancer, it was a common kind of cancer, and it was a very curable kind of cancer.”
But like many treatments, the surgery and chemo had its side effects. During halftime at Cornell that year, the coach stood in front of her team during a locker-room speech when she suddenly forgot what she was saying.
“I got tired,” Delaney-Smith recalls. “I remember we were in the Ivy race until the last weekend, and we lost the title, and that meant we wouldn’t be going on to the postseason. There’s a reason things happen, and the reason was someone didn’t want me to coach for another four weeks; someone wanted me to rest.”
ELEVEN YEARS LATER
Eleven years later, it’s hard to tell that Delaney-Smith ever went through hours of chemotherapy. Since that day in December, the winningest Ivy League women’s basketball coach has appeared in three of her total six NCAA tournaments and five of her total 11 Ivy League Championships.
But what Delaney-Smith and the American Cancer Association are most proud of is her continued presence in the cancer community. Not only was she one of the first to share her personal story with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, she has filmed public service announcements for TV and participates in the annual Harvard Relay for Life and Bench Press for Cancer events, as well as last weekend’s Pink Zone game benefiting the WBCA Kay Yow Cancer Fund.
“I think [Pink Zone] means a lot, and it’s also Alumni Weekend, so you can tell what a great program she’s built when you see all of these really successful women come back,” senior Emma Markley says. “We’ve got over 30 alumni here, and I think that says a lot about who she is, her character, and the impact she has on the players.”
ACT AS IF
While Delaney-Smith’s schedule now includes more events than before her diagnosis, cancer has left the coach with something bigger: a new mantra that starts with the phrase “act as if.”
“She said, ‘OK, if you guys are down by 20, act as if you’re up by 20. If you guys are pegged as the underdog in the Ivy League, act as if you’re pegged as the champion in the Ivy League,’” Barnard explains. “We kind of rolled our eyes at first, but ultimately, it was something that I still carry with me today.”
Delaney-Smith’s motto wasn’t just picked up by her players, but by a film director as well. In 2009, Melissa Johnson ’00 released her short documentary on Delaney-Smith, “Act As If,” which played at various film festivals across the nation.
“Even when the chips are down and the odds are against you and it’s terrible times, you act as if times are better,” Barnard continues. “You have the will inside of you to get you to that level. Kathy started to really embody that and push that on to us as she began to recover because she believed in it.”
STRENGTH TO PLAY
While Delaney-Smith’s “act as if” ideology helped her overcome cancer, she explains it also made her a stronger person in general, as shown last year when her older sister passed away from lung cancer.
“My dad died very young of lung cancer in his early 50s and my mom died of bone marrow cancer,” she says. “My older sister who’s just 10 months older than me just suddenly died of lung cancer last year. My sister and I are both breast cancer survivors, and my brother is a skin cancer survivor, so yeah, my family has been hit hard by cancer.”
Delaney-Smith’s strength can also be seen in those around her, especially in the attitudes of her past and present players both on and off the court.
“There have been times when we’ve been through some pretty bad stuff, and she doesn’t use [her struggle]. She doesn’t throw it out there, but sometimes you can see it, you see it in her face,” Markley says. “She’s relating to us like, I’ve been there, I’ve been down, I’ve seen the bottom, and this is how you get through it, this is how I’ve done it, and this is what strength is.”
For those who were with Delaney-Smith from the beginning, from the shaved head and wigs, seeing her last Saturday in a game benefiting breast cancer research reminded them of how tough Delaney-Smith is.
“I just heard today that she’s going into her 30th year,” Barnard recounts. “I just turned 30, so she was coaching when I was going into diapers—which is pretty amazing. I will always have her in my heart and my mind as my mentor in life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former two-sport athlete Niall D. Murphy ’03, who played a key role in the Harvard football team’s undefeated 2001 season, died suddenly last Wednesday morning from complications of juvenile diabetes. He was just 31.
To those who knew him, Murphy’s death came as a shock.
“[I’m] still kind of in a daze over it [a week later],” says Chuck Adamopoulos, Murphy’s high school football coach.
A home-grown talent, Murphy made quite an impact on the local sports scene from an early age. Before he donned the Crimson, the Lowell, Mass. native led his Central Catholic High School team to two Eastern Massachusetts Super Bowl titles as a quarterback.
But it wasn’t his quarterbacking skills that caught the eye of the Harvard coaches.
“He wasn’t a great thrower by Division I standards,” says Harvard football coach Tim Murphy (no relation). “He was a kid that we recruited as an athlete.”
And an athlete he was. On the gridiron, he made plays that, according to Adamopoulos, “[made] you shake your head and say, ‘Did I really just see that?’”
Murphy had also been quite an accomplished runner at the high school level, winning state titles in the 110 meter and 300 meter hurdles, and he continued running at Harvard. After joining the track and field team during his junior year, he quickly became the team’s best high hurdler, according to former coach Frank Haggerty ’68.   In fact, Murphy’s 60 meter hurdles time of 8.36 seconds is the fourth-fastest in Harvard history.
But Murphy’s main focus wasn’t running.
“[He] only competed in [the] indoor track [season] because [his] real love was football,” Tim Murphy says.
A tireless worker, Murphy earned a starting position in his sophomore season, this time as a strong safety.
It took him little time, by Tim Murphy’s account, to become the best at his position in the Ancient Eight. After playing an instrumental role on the unbeaten 2001 team, Murphy’s time as a defensive back culminated in an All-Ivy selection his senior year.
But athleticism was far from Murphy’s only attribute on the field. The son and grandson of high school football coaches, the safety had a deep understanding of the game.
Against Yale in 2002, for instance, Murphy noticed that the Bulldogs had set up in an unusual formation. Quickly and decisively, he changed the defensive alignment.
“[Yale] threw right into where our coverage was,” recalls former cornerback Chris Raftery ’04. “He definitely knew his stuff.”
Despite his large impact on the field, it was the way Murphy carried himself off of it that most impressed his teammates and his coaches.
“Niall was probably one of the most energetic, fun-loving people I’ve ever really come across,” says former wide receiver Carl Morris ’03. “He was everybody’s favorite, really. Everyone loved him.”
“He definitely helped out any young player no matter where they were on the depth chart, and that was enormous for morale,” Raftery adds. “He really went out of his way to be kind to everyone, and that always made a lasting impression on me.”
All the while, the former strong safety dealt with a severe case of diabetes. Diagnosed at the age of 11, Murphy had to constantly check his insulin levels and self-administer multiple injections a day. But he refused to let the disease get in his way.
“He was a guy who would never make an excuse for not doing something,” says former running back Nick Palazzo ’03. “He just looked at [his challenges] like speed bumps—he never let them define him and he used them to actually become a better athlete and person.
In fact, Murphy didn’t even disclose that he had diabetes during the recruiting process.
“I can vividly remember how I found that out,” Tim Murphy laughs.
After walking into the locker room before one practice, the coach noticed someone injecting himself in the leg. “And I said, ‘Oh my God, what do we have here?’ I’m thinking the worst – we’ve got a kid shooting up or something.”
“And [Niall] looked up and said, ‘Coach, it’s not what you think,’” Murphy continues. “And he laughed and told me.”
But, diabetes wasn’t Murphy’s only obstacle in college—as a senior, he lost his mother.
“Nothing really ever came easy for him,” Tim Murphy says.
Following graduation, Niall eventually became director of recruiting at MetLife Insurance, though he made sure to maintain his close ties to Harvard and Catholic Central football. Even after his death, though he hasn’t donned a Crimson uniform for nine years and a Raiders uniform for 13, he continues to have a big presence at his former institutions.
“I’ve been at this school for 27 years, and we’ve had a lot of good, successful people come out of this school,” Adamopoulos said. “But if I had to choose one person to represent the school and its values…Niall Murphy would be a great representative. He really was just a phenomenal, phenomenal kid.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last night, Harvard women’s water polo faced Brown in the Crimson’s first conference game of the season and routed the Ivy League rival, 15-5, in a personal milestone for coach Ted Minnis.
“That’s my first Ivy win against a varsity team, men or women’s,” Minnis said. “That’s what I’m always going to remember.”
Harvard (7-2, 1-0 CWPA) drove through the Bears (1-4, 0-1) in a push toward the ECAC Championships, where the teams will face each other yet again on Saturday.
With only a day’s rest between last night’s contest and Harvard’s five-game series over President’s Day weekend, traces of the fatigue that plagued the Crimson on Monday in its first two losses of the season were absent.
While last night’s game marked the end of a 10-day break for Brown, the extra rest was not sufficient to stop the Harvard charge led by junior co-captain Devan Kennifer, who racked up five goals, two steals, and an assist on the night.
Although the contest began slowly with the score knotted at one goal apiece for most of the opening five minutes, Kennifer launched what would become a nine-goal Crimson run with a skilled, backwards shot as she overpowered her sole defender to find an opening.
The Bears’ possessions were limited, particularly in the first and second quarters. But when they were able to take control on offense, the foundation of their strategy was built off frequent drives and constant movement.
On the other hand, Harvard seemed static on offense, merely passing the ball around the perimeter rather than driving to find openings.
Brown catered to the Crimson’s strengths in this way, dropping down on defense and allowing Harvard to control the perimeter with consistently accurate shots from players like freshman Shayna Price, sophomore Elise Molnar, and junior Monica Zdrojewski, all of whom notched two goals each, most of which came from behind the five-meter mark.
“Something that I talked about all year is that … we’re not going to adjust to what teams are doing—[we’re going to] make them have to … adjust to what we’re doing,” Minnis said. “That’s a big part of what we did. We didn’t try to come in and change who we are. We just came in and said ‘This is us, try and stop us.’”
The Crimson’s tight press defense succeeded in keeping the ball outside of the Bears’ two-meter mark—or anywhere within their perimeter—for most of the night.
The combination of Harvard’s up-close defense and Brown’s mobile offense proved to be a formula for multiple defensive ejections for the Crimson.
“Our defense just couldn’t quite handle it sometimes,” Kennifer said. “They … got us kicked out a couple of times, but I think our five-on-six defense stopped them most times. We’d like to minimize those kick outs, but the fact that we can recover when we do is comforting.”
Harvard showed it was able to more than recover from these disadvantages on multiple occasions throughout the night. In particular, toward the close of the first half, after Price was ejected, Kennifer shut down a shot from the Bears with a brutal block that landed right in Price’s path as she was exiting the penalty box.
Running with her luck, Price took the ball down to Brown territory, unmarked and untouched, only to fake a shot and then skip it into the goal, boosting the score to 7-1. The Crimson brought the score to 9-1 before the end of the half.
With the break came the end of the Harvard’s streak of nine unanswered goals; the Bears scored within the first 30 seconds of the next half.
Although its shots rarely found the back of the net, Brown came out in the second half with a different mentality. The Bears were much more aggressive with their offense and got off several more shots than in the first half.
However, after a slight offensive lull, the Crimson picked up again toward the end of the third stanza, going on a 3-0 run to cement its dominance.
The start of the fourth quarter brought in the second-string players, who rode down the clock—and scored a few goals—to finalize the 15-5 victory.
With a rematch with Brown on the horizon in less than three days, Harvard is going to continue practicing in hopes of repeating its success.
But Saturday’s game won’t be any different from last night’s, according to Minnis.
“We’re going to keep playing the system,” Minnis said. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

You may have heard the word "Vinyasa" used before to describe a yoga class, but do you really know what it means? Vinyasa is a style of yoga that emphasizes breath-movement coordination and repetitions of flowing poses.
Some of Vinyasa's more recognizable poses are downward dog, commonly used as a resting position, and repeated sequences of plank, chaturanga, and upward facing dog. Though most Vinyasa classes share these common poses, other Vinyasa poses vary widely.
Kerry L. Smith, a Vinyasa yoga teacher at Hemenway Gym, takes requests to target specific body regions during her sessions—try the hip openers if you have been spending long hours sitting in Lamont.
"As a teacher, I can be so creative with the order of the poses and the sequence, depending on the students in my classes; it's a lot of fun to teach because it's different every time," Smith wrote in an e-mail.
Vinyasa classes are offered frequently throughout the week, and the hours can be found on the MAC and Hemenway websites. As different instructors teach during different time slots throughout the week, these Flyby correspondents suggest testing the waters to figure out which class best fits your needs.
All Harvard Vinyasa classes are rated as intermediate level by the Harvard Athletic Department, which suggests attending five beginner classes before attempting an intermediate level class. Feel free, however, to use your own discretion in choosing a class at the appropriate level of intensity.
"Listen to your body. Don't forget to breathe," wrote Smith, as a caution to beginning yogis.
In addition to achieving a heightened connection between breath and body, Vinyasa yoga also offers an intense stretching and strengthening workout. Before you go to any Harvard group exercise class, remember to register online.
Next stop on these correspondents' yoga journey—power yoga. Stay tuned!

Never before have so many vibrators, dildos, strap-ons, butt plugs, harnesses, and handcuffs graced the couches and chairs of Ticknor Lounge.
Yesterday, a crowd of women and a handful of men showed up for Afternoon Delight, a sex toy workshop hosted by Girlspot and co-sponsored by Queer Students and Allies and the Radcliffe Union of Students.
"I really wanted to have some sort of [event] around Valentine's Day or in the month of February, where people are thinking about love, people are thinking about sex," said Elizabeth C. Elrod '11, who organized the event.
The workshop was led by Sinclair Sexsmith, a "kinky queer butch top" according to her blog. Mr. Sexsmith—who prefers the masculine honorific 'Mr.' and the feminine pronouns 'she' and 'her'—spoke about erotica fiction, the benefits of experimentation, and the underappreciated wonders of lube during her presentation.
"I hope people will go away from a workshop like this with a broader mind around exploring their own sexuality, what they desire, and what might be possible to get from exploring—and then maybe a couple of tools for figuring that out," Sexsmith said.
Sexsmith explained her personal motivation for leading sex toy workshops.
"In my own personal journey of trying to figure out how to get what I wanted in the bedroom, when I started getting it, I started thinking, 'Oh! This is something valuable. I should tell other people about it.'"
Harvard students were clearly interested in her expertise—or at least in the free sex toys given away at the end.

Ever had the urge to run out of the classroom and get your hands dirty? The Harvard Community Garden, located in the open lot in front of Lowell House, gives Harvard students just that opportunity. 
"The purpose of the garden is to provide experiential hands-on education in what we feel is the critical issue of sustainable agriculture," said Kathleen M. Frith, administrative director of the garden.
 
Normally home to mixed beds of flowers and vegetables, the garden currently sits hidden under inches of snow. Garden volunteers joke that it has become one of Boston's many "snow farms."  
 
 
This past winter, garden volunteers attempted to experiment with winter gardening to little success. The PVC pipe structures built to shield seedlings from the winter weather, however, were no match for the heavy snows and collapsed in December.  
Rebecca J. Cohen '12, co-manager of the garden, said she expects growth in the garden in the near future.
"Once the soil thaws a little, we're going to be planting our first round of vegetables that can handle the early spring cold," Cohen said. "Expect to see green things growing as early as April!"
