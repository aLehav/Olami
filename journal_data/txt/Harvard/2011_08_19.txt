RIO DE JANEIRO—“You don’t have to be afraid of going there—my cousin is a drug lord so the big guns won’t bother you,” my tour guide Filipe assured me. “It’s OK. I don’t need to collect data from that neighborhood,” I responded. We decided to stick to safer favelas.
I nervously clung onto the waist of my motorcycle taxi driver as we sped down the motorway. I was comforted, in part, by his decision to take the potholes slower than he normally would have. The obvious fear that the wide-eyed look on my face conveyed had convinced him to do that, but not to encourage me to wear a helmet—he refused my request, saying it was unnecessary.
I promised my friends and parents that I would only go to the favelas, or illegal and informal settlements, that were “pacificado.” However, the trip to the slum of Vidigal gave me a much better look into the real state of most of Rio de Janeiro’s favelas.
“Don’t take pictures around this corner,” Fil told me. He had let me take pictures everywhere during our trip this Saturday morning. “This is the drug dealers’ corner.” According to Fil, every favela has an area that drug dealers sell in and everybody knows where that is, so even though he was not from this favela, he knew when to be cautious.
I looked to my right, where an imposing man stood with a large metal gun slung over his right shoulder. In his hand was a huge bag of what looked like cocaine. He was dealing to a 200-pound woman, who appeared to be begging him, mercilessly.
One gram of cocaine here in the favelas sells for about six U.S. dollars. But because tourists don’t know how abundant cocaine is in these hills, the dealers can often get upwards of sixty dollars per gram when they sell on the beach. I was surprised to see the heavyset woman purchasing cocaine, so I asked Fil about it.
“Oh, it’s the old people who normally do cocaine—especially old women! They’re hooked. The young people do marijuana.”
Among the endangered birds and lush tropical rainforests that populate the million-dollar views of Ipanema Beach, lie squatter settlements oversaturated with drug dealers who make thousands of dollars a month, several times greater than the average salary of favela residents (a few hundred dollars a month.) Their business model is to hook young people on their drugs and kill rival dealers. It is a place even the police avoid.
A month ago, I arrived in Rio de Janeiro with a thesis idea and a goal: Surveys to be completed by 110 favela residents on their transportation methods and housing status. However, as I visited more and more favelas, the issue I plan to study seems more daunting than ever. There are over 500 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, each housing some 15,000 people.
The rising cost of living in Rio makes it increasingly difficult for favela residents to continue living there. Furthermore, some of these houses are not in safe building zones, and the pressure to relocate these residents combined with the incentives to build expensive condominiums in the place of the favelas, creates even more tension between residents and the local government.
The 80-page document that I turn in next spring will offer an environmentally and economically sustainable solution that I deem an efficient use of time and money from a scholarly perspective. However, implementing such change when lives, histories, and families are at stake is another battle entirely.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BERLIN—My friend B. leans against the windowsill and he grins a grin that seems to split his face in half. He has black, chunky headphones around his neck—you know the kind, the kind that is worn by all your friends who read Resident Advisor but that professional DJs never seem to bother with—and he’s smoking the tiniest joint I’ve ever seen out the window of our acquaintance’s kitchen window. I think to myself that maybe tiny joints are cool in Berlin, or maybe not, because I haven’t quite decided whether or not B. himself is cool in Berlin.
“But of everything I’ve seen in this last few months, you know my favorite thing of Berlin?” he drawls, savoring the suspense that he’s built for a piece of wisdom we never really asked for.
“I have a friend, a friend from Berlin, he works the door in Watergate.” Watergate is one of Berlin’s bigger electro clubs, and is harder to get into than most venues in a city known for its democratic nightlife—where you’re encouraged to dress down, where it’s more of an asset to be a gay man than a pretty girl, and where a polo shirt screams dickhead and/or tourist in popular conception.
“And one day I ask my friend, why do they never let in people who are wearing a collared shirt.” It’s true; they don’t. I went there once with a classical musician from Vienna—the kind of bloke that’s so impossibly charming you always wonder why he bothers hanging out with folks like you—and he was turned away, because he had a white shirt and pants on. Rookie error: I sauntered happily past wearing white-turned-brown sneakers and a T-shirt that looked like an apron from a thrift store.
“And my friend, he says, well, there is a reason.” B.’s consonants are thick and chalky; everyone thinks he’s from Turkey but he’s actually Bulgarian.
“This is what he says. He says, our club is our house. When we party in our house, we want everyone to be equal. If you wear a fancy shirt, like Pierre Cardin or whatever”—here B. pulls on his stencil tee and swigs on his Augustiner for effect—“then you’re trying to say you’re not equal to the others. And we don’t like this.”
A smile goes around the kitchen, among all of us foreign interns just working in Berlin for the summer. We like the happy ending.
But the resident good-times girl—a Southern Californian trying her hand at all-black indie chic—pipes in: “But there’s still a VIP room at Watergate, though, isn’t there?”
My friend B. raises an eyebrow, his dénouement interrupted. “Yes,” he persists, “but, you know, there’s no one in there wearing a collared shirt.”
I tried to go to Watergate that weekend with a fashionable Canadian friend, speaking English in the line and dressed, well, quite nicely. We were turned away at the door. Trudging back past the line, my mate inspected the fastidiously scruffy scene-kids with a mixture of dismay and perplexity—as if wondering what we had done wrong. And then it was out into the morning sun and a falafel at the Imbiss on the corner.
“I guess there’s a VIP room everywhere,” muses my friend B. as he finishes his beer and smiles again.

VENICE, Italy—From as early as I can remember, my parents and teachers virulently decried smoking. Smoking kills—it’s that simple. The fast track to lung cancer? A pack a day.
I’m not sure whether Italians don’t believe this truth or just ignore the warnings on cigarette packages. Regardless, Italian children, just like American ones, form opinions towards smoking at an early age.
I was sitting with my roommate in the back of a vaporetto during my last weekend in Venice when a group of parents and children joined us. The scene couldn’t have been more innocently idyllic: the children sucked away on their lollipops while the adults filled the air with congenial conversation.
After a few final licks, one of the girls finished her lollipop. Satisfied, the child, who couldn’t have been more than six years old, took the stick out of her mouth and held it in front of her father, waiting for something. After the girl muttered something to him, the dad pretended to light the end of her lollipop as if it were a cigarette. She then pretended to smoke, suavely holding the stick between her pointer and middle fingers while elegantly puffing out air. She continued the game for a minute or so before growing bored.
My roommate and I exchanged surprised looks. What took me aback wasn’t that the little girl feigned smoking in order to imitate those around her, or to play at being a grown-up. I’ve seen that happen in America. Indeed, there is a certain coolness associated with smoking in both countries. And a child pretending to smoke at age six doesn’t mean that she will definitely be a smoker in ten years.
No, what shocked me about the whole thing—and what I’d never seen before—was that the dad indulged her, implicitly encouraging her in this little game.
Through his actions, the father sent a clear message: as far as he was concerned, the prospect of his daughter smoking raised no problems. He was, from the standpoint of an onlooker, in a sense priming a child for when she’d actually be able to smoke.
The Italian father and daughter attached no stigma to smoking; they saw no problem with it at all. Simply, the girl was too young to actually smoke. Now, she could only pretend. But when she is old enough, she can join the rest of society, lighting up once or twice or ten times a day.
In America, a parallel attitude exists toward another deeply ingrained social phenomenon: drinking. Drinking is frowned upon until a certain age—the legally enforced 21—but once a person passes that landmark, the activity becomes totally admissible and even welcomed. In many settings, there is a stigma associated with not drinking.
And sometimes, American parents prime their children to drink when they’re older, too. It’s no surprise that in celebrations, parents often whip out Martinelli’s, a sparkling, gold-colored cider that quite closely resembles champagne.
Of course, the health issues of smoking are far greater than those of drinking, at least when done in moderation. Yet still, it’s not quite fair to cast a blanket criticism over the Italian way of life. We’re all products of our environment, absorbing the thoughts and attitudes of our society.
So don’t worry Phillip Morris. Your business is safe in Italy.
And American breweries don’t need to hold their breath, either.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
DETROIT, Mich.—Excitement is high around the city this summer, as millions of dollars of investment pour into what is shaping up to be a burgeoning high-tech corridor. Access to world-class universities, venture funding, a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and cheap real estate are drawing talented, young people downtown. Momentum is such that Forbes recently named the city as one of the best places for entrepreneurs. All good news from an unlikely place: Detroit. At a time of bitter debt talks and cries of a failed recovery, Detroit and other parts of Michigan are showing signs of hope.
New governor Rick Snyder, a former computer executive and venture capitalist, has been working to reform state government at a blistering pace. Signing a balanced budget, enacting greater state control over financially distressed municipalities, and placing a strong emphasis on fostering transparency and accountability in state government, Snyder is changing the way that the state does business. Though highly controversial, he has brought dramatic changes to Lansing at a faster rate than anyone in recent memory.
In 2008, after the crash and subsequent government auto-bailout, many across the country began giving up on the state of Michigan. A mainstay on the FBI’s list of the most dangerous cities, Detroit in particular has inspired many late-night TV jokes and born much negative publicity. As G.M. filed for bankruptcy and global demand took a dive, many automotive suppliers found themselves out of business.
Three years later, the resurgent Big Three (General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford) and their suppliers have regrouped and become lean and agile. G.M., for example, is now hiring less experienced employees at considerably reduced costs and is exploring new models of profit sharing with workers instead of guaranteeing fixed automatic yearly salary increases. Having realized that they can’t afford to be so dependent on the local automotive industry, suppliers have taken a global perspective of their businesses. Now, even the smaller manufacturing and engineering services firms compete for auto business everywhere from Rio to Beijing. More importantly, some of them are capitalizing on their technology to enter new verticals like aerospace and energy.
Meanwhile, other Michiganders are trying their hand at new ventures across the state, including movie making, renewable energy, and tourism. With some of the most generous film tax credits in the nation, a number of films have been shot in Michigan in the past few years. The "Pure Michigan" campaign has been very successful in boosting tourism in the Great Lakes State, particularly by advertising its greatest natural resource—the largest group of freshwater lakes on earth.
Granted there are still serious problems here. Unemployment hovers over the national average; homes remain indefinitely on sale; and many are still looking to leave the state. But innovation in both the private and public sector, coupled with the palpable passion and excitement we both feel here, could once again make Michigan a key player in the national economy.
