After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Massachusetts scored above the national average in overall civic engagement but experienced drops in voter turnout and other political activity, according to an Institute of Politics report released Wednesday.
“I think this report was definitely a wake-up call for the residents of Massachusetts to get re-engaged in politics in our communities,” said ImeIme A. Umana ’14, principal author of the Massachusetts Civic Health Index.
A team of four Harvard undergraduates from the IOP published the report in collaboration with the National Conference on Citizenship and the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement. The Index draws on data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey.
The report found that Massachusetts was ranked 11th in the nation for voter turnout. In 2010, 52.2 percent of eligible Massachusetts voted during midterm elections, while the national average was 45.5 percent. This marks a decline from the 2006 midterm election, when Massachusetts had 55.4 percent voter turnout rate.
A particular concern that the findings revealed was the disparity in voter participation among racial groups. Turnout for Massachusetts African Americans and Latinos, at 41.2 percent and 14 percent respectively, lagged behind national data at 44 percent and 31.2 percent.
“There’s a real gap between turnout for Latinos and African Americans compared to white Americans,” said C. M. “Trey” Grayson ’94, director of the IOP. “The Latino population is growing in Massachusetts—if we are not engaging them and they are not turning out the vote, we have a problem.”
An unexpected finding of the report, according to the authors, was the low level of social connectedness among state residents. The study included a variety of activities, ranging from helping out neighbors to attending community meetings, in its definition of social connectedness.
While the state placed 21st in the nation in rate of volunteering, the study ranked Massachusetts 46th among Americans who self-reported helping their neighbors at least a few times a week. Past studies have correlated civic involvement and social connection with lower levels of unemployment, according to Kristen Cambell, chief program officer of the National Conference on Citizenship.
Those involved with the study said they see this as an opportunity for policymakers to refocus on issues of civic engagement.
“There was an impression that Massachusetts citizens were more engaged in their communities and politics,” Grayson said. “What we found was that Massachusetts is above average in a lot of categories, but not a national leader in any of them. It’s not quite as good as you think—there’s some work to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Age-old rivals Harvard and Yale found themselves competing once again as the schools vied to collect the greater quantity of blood in Red Cross-sponsored drives held on each campus during the past two weeks.
The annual Harvard-Yale Blood Drive, which kicked off on Tuesday at Harvard, was held in Adams House, Hillel, and the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Yale’s Red Cross chapter held its own drive one week earlier but will not release the tally of pints of blood that it collected until the Red Cross confirms the number of pints Harvard amassed, according to David R. Grieder ’14, co-director of blood services for the Harvard Red Cross.
The blood drive drew both first-time and veteran donors.
“I’ve always wanted to donate blood,” said Medha B. Gargeya ’14. “I’m lucky to be a universal donor, so I have often entertained this romantic notion that my blood would be useful for many individuals in need.”
Caroline K. Lauer ’14, who has made multiple donations since her junior year in high school, said that the thought of beating Yale gave her an “extra incentive” to donate.
In an effort to reduce wait times, the Harvard Red Cross introduced online registration and screening this year.
“We’re trying to reach a balance between getting people in the door and getting the right people in the door,” Grieder said.
But a last-minute technological glitch prevented several people from donating. At 4:15 p.m. on Friday—just 45 minutes before the drive was slated to end—nurses left their stations and addressed students sitting in the waiting area.
“It’s not hopeful,” said one nurse. “It doesn’t look great. The computers just aren’t working.”
Upon hearing the news, a few students departed, but others waited to see whether they would be able to give blood. The machines were not fixed.
Grieder said that he expects the Red Cross will release Harvard’s blood pint count on Monday.
In previous years, the losing school sent its rival a photo of its dean wearing the winner’s logo t-shirt. But Grieder could not confirm whether the deal will hold true this year when the blood drive’s winner is eventually announced.
“Either way the outcome is good,” Grieder said. “If we beat Yale, we get glory. If we lose, we still get the satisfaction of saving lives. That’s why people put on blood drives, and that’s the reason people come to donate.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Day eight and no signs of stopping yet—114 points in that time-span and no hints of slowing down. Three games started and the only thing bigger than the stats of Jeremy Lin ’10 on Friday night was the smile on his face after hitting yet another shot.
When the final buzzer sounded and the New York Knicks defeated the Los Angeles Lakers, 92-85, the Madison Square Garden crowd chanted and chanted “MVP”, held up masks of Lin’s face and signs reading “Nothing is Linpossible.” And for the night, that slogan held true for the Harvard alum, as he posted a game-high 38 points, seven assists, four rebounds, and two steals, leading his team to its fourth-consecutive win.
In just the two hours following the win, nine topics relating to Lin trended worldwide, including “Legend in New York [LIN]” and “Super Lintendo”.
“I am really not too worried about proving anything to anybody,” said Lin in his post-game interview. “As a team, we are growing and I think everyone is buying into it and that is why we are becoming more dangerous.”
Modesty aside, his game was nothing short of record-breaking. Lin has scored 89 points in his first three games starting for the Knicks, a number that proves to be the most since the ABA/NBA merger in 1976.
This game was anticipated by many as a test for the second-year guard, who would, for the first time, face one of the league’s leading defenses. The Lakers boast of two seven-footers in their front-line, making their height a formidable challenge for many opponents—but, in this game at least, L.A.’s bigs could not stand as tall as the 6’3 guard, who topped his previous career-high by 10 points.
Prior to the game, when the Lakers’ Kobe Bryant was asked about Lin, the NBA veteran’s response equated to a shoulder shrug and a shake-off of the question: “I know who he is, but I don’t really know what’s going on with him. I don’t even know what he’s done.” After more prodding from reporters, and having acquired Lin’s recent stats, Bryant added: “He’s averaging 28 and eight? No [expletive]. If he’s playing well, I’ll just have to deal with him.”
After tonight’s game, Bryant was a little more complimentary.
“It’s a great story. It’s a testament to perseverance and hard work and a good example for kids everywhere.”
Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni agreed with Bryant’s sentiments, emphasizing Lin’s big plays down the stretch.
“What he’s doing is amazing,” said Knicks coach Mike D’Antoni. “He answered a lot of questions tonight. Can he make an outside shot? Can he pull the trigger in a big moment? He hit two 3s that just broke the game open. There’s so much stuff that he’s doing."
With the Knicks’ website now advertising a new “Lin-Sanity” iPhone app and ESPN finishing a Harvard alumni montage that included the likes of John Adams and JFK with Lin’s smiling face, the entire league is awaiting for his next move. Fans won’t have to wait long, however, as Lin and his Knicks take on the Linnesota Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 8 Harvard women’s hockey team rebounded from its tough loss to Boston College at the Beanpot, sweeping Rensselaer and Union this weekend to clinch home ice in the opening round of the ECAC playoffs.
Against Rensselaer (9-19-4, 6-12-2 ECAC) on Friday night, a strong start carried Harvard (18-8-1, 15-4-1) to a 4-2 victory. The following afternoon, the Crimson was able to close out the perfect weekend, as strong play by junior goalie Laura Bellamy lifted Harvard to a 1-0 victory over Union (4-24-4, 2-16-2).
“We played really well Friday night, and I was impressed with how intense we came out right off the bat,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “Rensselaer is a good team, and I think we controlled the majority of the game. On Saturday, it wasn’t our best game, but we were able to persevere.”
The Crimson continued to perform at a high level on the road, finishing the regular season with a 10-3-1 record away from the Bright Hockey Center.
HARVARD 1, UNION 0
Sophomore forward Lyndsey Fry’s first-period goal, her second score of the weekend, proved to be the difference in the 1-0 victory over Union in Troy, N.Y.
With under thirty seconds remaining in the first period, Dempsey was able to steal the puck away from the Union defender and found Fry as she entered the Union zone. Fry weaved between the Dutchwomen defenders before lofting a well-placed shot into the top corner of the goal.
“I think that [the goal] was important at the time,” Dempsey said. “We hadn’t gotten on the board yet, and it was a little frustrating since we were dominating the period but didn’t have any results. So it was great to get that goal and get that momentum.”
The Crimson was able to maintain the lead behind the strong play of Bellamy, who recorded 24 saves in the shutout.
“Bellamy was terrific for us,” Stone said. “She had to be, and we got the goaltending when we needed it.”
The shutout was Bellamy’s sixth of the season and second against the Dutchwomen.
Harvard was able to control the puck for a majority of the game, peppering the Union goalie with 35 shots. But the Crimson was unable to increase its lead, as Dutchwoman netminder Kate Gallagher recorded 34 saves.
But behind a strong defensive effort keyed by Bellamy, the Crimson was able to preserve the one-goal lead and ultimately the victory.
HARVARD 4, RENSSELAER 2
Facing the Engineers in Schenectady, N.Y., the Crimson was able to get on the board first when Harvard freshman Samantha Reber scored off an assist from Dempsey with a little over five minutes left in the first period.
“In the past five or six games, the other team scored first, and we have had to play comeback,” Dempsey said. “So to score first in RPI was huge for us.”
Sophomore Marissa Gedman widened the Crimson’s lead to three with two power-play goals in the second period.
After Fry added another score for the Crimson in the third, the Engineers began to strike back, as senior Laura Guillemette and junior Taylor Horton pulled Rensselaer within two with a little under nine minutes remaining. But the comeback proved to be too little too late, as the Engineers failed to score the rest of the way.
With the weekend sweep, Harvard created some needed momentum for the upcoming home games against Brown and Yale.
“If we go out there and do that, we will put ourselves in a good spot heading into the playoffs,” Dempsey said. “We have the ability to control the game from start to finish and play Harvard hockey.”

With the overall score tied at three and all eyes on his match, freshman Alex Steinroeder took one more deep breath, tossed the ball into the air, and began the final game. Fifteen-love. Thirty-love. Forty-love. Victory.
With Steinroeder’s win, the match results were final, and Harvard men’s tennis took down Virginia Tech (2-2), 4-3, Saturday afternoon at the Murr Center. Hours later, the winning streak continued as the home team defeated Boston University (0-3), 6-1.
HARVARD 4, VIRGINIA TECH 3
It was not an easy win for the Crimson (6-1), as Steinroeder had to come back and tie his opponent three times in the final set, including a late two-point deficit, in order to give his team the victory over the Hokies.
“I thought it was a really good team effort,” Steinroeder said. “We started off strong in the doubles, and that really set the tone for the match. ”
At the beginning of the afternoon, Harvard earned the doubles point after winning two of the three doubles matches. Partners junior Andy Nguyen and freshman Denis Nguyen as well as co-captain Alistair Felton and sophomore Casey Macmaster defeated their opponents, 8-5 apiece.
In singles play, the competition was much tighter. Early on, senior Jonathan Pearlman fell to Luka Somen, a senior ranked 54th nationally, 6-1, 6-2. Sophomore Christo Schultz rebounded for his teammate, winning 6-3, 6-2, and improving his singles record to 5-0 on the year. Freshman Shaun Chaudhuri followed Schultz’s lead, winning his match, 6-4, 6-3.
Only freshmen Henry Steer and Steinroeder were left playing their opponents in what Felton deemed an “epic battle in the three and four spots.” Steer, who split his first two sets, 6-2, 4-6, went down after a lengthy final set, 4-6. At that point it was all up to Steinroeder, who, one minute and four consecutive points later, took the match for Harvard in a come-from behind victory, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5.
“When I was down 6-3, 3-0, it wasn’t looking good,” Steinroeder said. “But I just started focusing on making more serves and making my opponent play. In the third set, even though I was down, I felt like I was playing pretty well. I just wanted to continue playing like that and just see what happened. Luckily, we got the win.”
Felton praised Steinroeder, emphasizing how timely the performance was.
“He pulled off some shots that I just couldn’t believe he made under such pressure,” Felton said. “There was a series of volleys that had me shaking my head in disbelief.”
HARVARD 6, BOSTON UNIVERSITY 1
In the second match of the day, Harvard was in the driver’s seat from start to finish, sweeping doubles play and winning all but one in the singles against the Terriers.
First up for the Crimson was the pair of Schultz and Steer, who, despite having had only 20 minutes since the last match ended, handily defeated their opponent, 8-5. They handed it off to MacMaster and Chaudhuri, who did not lose a set all the way through, winning the match, 8-0, and setting the pace for the rest of the day’s games. Last in doubles play was Felton and sophomore Brendan Seaver, who took down their Boston University counterparts, 8-6.
“That was our best doubles performance of the year so far,” Felton said. “We hardly lost any points on our serves, hardly any at all.”
When play resumed and the singles matches took the court, it appeared the confidence from both Steinroeder’s initial win and the recent doubles sweep held steady for Harvard. Despite Pearlman’s loss in three sets to Josh Friedman, 3-6, 6-3, 1-0, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way.
Chaudhuri took an early lead in his third match of the day and never gave it up, finishing at 6-3, 6-3. Denis Nguyen was next, putting Harvard another notch above its cross-river rivals as he won, 6-0, 6-2, and Felton shortly followed with a score of 6-1, 6-2.
Freshman Jeffrey Parker made one of his first appearances of the season and wasted no time getting acquainted with collegiate play, taking down his Terrier competition, 7-5, 6-0.
The last match of the day took place between Seaver and opponent Bill Kring. Though it went to three sets, the sophomore took control when it mattered and sealed the day’s events with a score of 6-4, 4-6, 1-0.
Felton attributed the ability to win these two matches, so close together time-wise, to the hunger of the team.
“It could’ve been difficult, but the attitudes of the players we have this year, their appetites for the game are so great, that even those who just finished their singles matches wanted to play doubles against BU,” Felton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
PRINCETON, N.J.—After defeating Penn on Friday night, the No. 21/25 Harvard men’s basketball team was expected to complete its first road sweep of the “Killer P’s” since 1985 at Princeton on Saturday night.
And for much of the game, it looked like the heavily favored Crimson was poised to do just that, leading with less than 10 minutes to play.
But junior Kyle Casey missed four of five free throws down the stretch, and the Tigers closed the game on a 28-18 run to grab a 70-62 win in front of a packed house at Jadwin Gymnasium.
The Crimson surrendered 48 second-half points, a season high, as the Tigers connected on 15 of 24 (62.5 percent) attempts from the field in the frame.
“Certainly it was a tough, tough loss for us,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I told our kids that I thought Princeton deserved to win. I thought they played an exceptional second half.”
Harvard (21-3, 7-1 Ivy) struggled to contain Princeton (13-10, 4-3) forward Ian Hummer in the post all night, as the junior led the Tigers with 20 points, nine rebounds, and six assists.
Offensively the Crimson turned in one of its worst shooting performances of the season, going five of 18 from beyond the arc and getting to the free-throw line just 11 times, matching its second lowest total of the season.
Harvard’s offensive woes intensified down the stretch, as the Crimson went one of seven from deep and three of seven from the charity stripe in the final 10:44 of play.
“I was disappointed in our inability to make the plays necessary in the second half offensively,” Amaker said.
But perhaps more devastating to Harvard’s hope of grabbing its first win at Jadwin since 1989 was its inability to come up with stops late in the game. After holding the Tigers to 38.5 percent shooting in the first half, the Crimson allowed Princeton to connect on eight of its final 10 attempts from the field.
“We found something that worked on offense, and we just kept going to it,” said Princeton’s TJ Bray, who scored seven points in the game’s final 8:44 and finished with 12 points and four assists on the night. “Harvard likes to get up and try to get in the passing lanes, and that’s really when our back-door offense is huge for us.... A lot of stuff was open back door tonight.”
Bray put Princeton ahead by two, 48-46, with 5:14 to play after spinning baseline and sticking a short jumper.
Casey (12 points) attacked the basket on the other end, nearly converting an and-one layup, but the ball rimmed out, and the junior went to the line with two shots.
Casey, a 76.6 percent career shooter from the stripe, went one of two, pulling the Crimson within one, 48-47.
On the ensuing Tigers’ possession, Casey committed a foul on Hummer as the forward drove to the basket, and Hummer made Harvard pay, knocking down both attempts.
The Crimson went back to Casey, who again drove into the lane, nearly finishing another conventional three-point play. But it was not to be, and Casey returned to the line, where he missed both tries.
Mack Darrow extended Princeton’s lead to five, finishing a put-back layup off a Hummer miss.
With 2:58 to go, Casey had a chance to bring Harvard within three after being sent to the line, but he missed the front end of the one-and-one. Princeton extended its lead to seven on the other end thanks to a conventional three-point play from Brendan Connolly.
Bray gave the Tigers a 10-point lead 25 seconds later, sticking two free throws to put Princeton up, 59-49, with 2:05 to go.
The Crimson pulled within four off a layup from junior point guard Brandyn Curry (15 points) with 53 ticks left on the clock, but Harvard was unable to get any closer as the Tigers went seven of eight from the line to close the game.
Co-captain Keith Wright notched his fourth double-double of the season, posting a team-high 16 points on 7-of-11 shooting and 12 boards. Wright scored four points during a 12-2 first-half run that put the Crimson ahead by seven with 3:22 to play in the first.
From there, the Crimson never trailed until 7:27 remained in the match, when Patrick Saunders stuck a fadeaway mid-range jumper that put the Tigers up 46-44.
Despite the loss, the Crimson maintains a one-game lead in the Ivy League standings as it seeks its first NCAA tournament berth since 1946.
“We’re not necessarily happy with the outcome, but certainly there’s a lot of basketball to be played,” Amaker said.

Princeton dominated the Harvard women’s basketball team Saturday night, as the No. 1 team in the Ivy League went up by as many as 40 points and left Lavietes Pavilion with an 84-56 win.
The Tigers (17-4, 7-0 Ivy) displayed their supremacy early in the contest, opening an 11-4 lead. A short Crimson (12-9, 5-2) run closed the gap to five, 19-14, but Princeton answered right back with a 12-0 run and went up at halftime, 37-18.
The deficit could largely be attributed to Harvard’s inability to convert on open looks. The team shot 17 percent from the field and nine percent from three in the first frame, while the Tigers knocked down 52 percent of its shots and 44 percent from behind the arc in the first half of action.
“We had nine or 10 shots that went around the rim and out,” Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “What happens when you start missing those…is you hang your head a little, you stop hitting the boards, you don’t cover breakaways, [and] they start making spin-around layups. We react to our offense, and that’s a weakness for us. It’s why we are not a good defensive team.”
The second half was no better for Harvard. Coming out of the locker room, the team gave up a 13-4 run that ended with Princeton up 28 and the game all but out of reach. From there, the score only got uglier. The Crimson’s offensive pestilence continued as the Tigers blew the game even more wide open. At one point, the visitors boasted a 41-point, 80-39 lead.
“We didn’t have the team focus that we needed,” co-captain Brogan Berry said. “We had a lot of individual effort, but it just wasn’t collective as a team. You have to be able to feed off of each other, and we didn’t do that.”
Continuing the battle, sophomore Christine Clark repeatedly drove to the basket, scoring several times and drawing fouls on other occasions late in the game. She finished with 13 second-half points before the buzzer brought an end to the 84-56 onslaught.
“She’ll never stop trying,” said Delaney-Smith of Clark who finished with 17 points but made only five of her 19 shots from the field and one of five from deep. “She’s an incredible player. I’m sorry she had some bad shooting nights this weekend. It’s out of character for her.”
Captain Brogan Berry led the home squad with 21 points, her second straight 20-point outing.
Clark and Berry’s output wasn’t enough to keep up with Princeton’s two-headed monster of junior Niveen Rasheed and senior Lauren Edwards. Rasheed finished with 24 points and several highlight layups while Edwards contributed 13.
Rasheed delivered a number of eye-catching plays on fast breaks that thrilled her team and the large contingent of Princeton supporters in the stands.
“[Our strategy was] just to play defense on her,” Delaney-Smith said. “We didn’t. We were soft. We couldn’t have more errors defensively. We just have to play her tougher. I don’t feel we played her smart individually or as a team. And then she started feeling good. That’s exactly what we try to stop.”
A day after battling Penn in a win, Harvard’s poor shooting night and weak defense could be attributed to tired legs. Five Crimson players logged over 25 minutes in Friday’s contest, while the Tigers rested their starters during a drubbing of Dartmouth. Yet Berry didn’t think the Crimson’s struggles could be attributed fatigue.
“I didn’t think it showed how tired we were physically,” Berry said. “It was more our mental focus. Our focus wasn’t there [Saturday].”
Harvard is now 1-4 against Princeton in its last five matchups. In one of the biggest games of the year, Delaney-Smith was disappointed by the how the team failed to show up.
“Who knows why you don’t show up for such an important game,” she said. “I’m kind of shocked.”
“The sad thing is we had worked so hard preparing for them all week,” Berry said. “I feel like we knew them inside and out, and I feel like we just couldn’t take what we had and execute on the floor.”

The Harvard ski team competed in its third carnival in as many weekends, finishing ninth overall at Dartmouth this Saturday.
With a total time of 1:54.26 in the women’s grand slalom, sophomore Rebecca Nadler’s second-place finish turned out to be the team’s strongest performance of the weekend. She came in less than a second behind Vermont’s Kate Ryley. Senior Caroline McHugh and junior Catherine Sheils also gained NCAA points in the event, finishing 26th and 27th with times of 1:58.48 and 1:59.69, respectively, .
Junior cross-country skier Alena Tofte led all Harvard women in the event coming in ninth place with a 14:31.1 5k on day one. Her 50:57.7 15k on day two was good for 18th.
On the men’s side sophomore Christopher Stock won NCAA points in both cross-country events, with a 13th place finish in the 10k and a 23rd place finish in the 20k. But ultimately, the alpine team was unable to replicate the feat, and neither team could break through with any top-10 finishers.

The Harvard wrestling team lost two tight matches Saturday against Brown and Boston University, 22-17 and 21-17, respectively. Both the Bears and the Terriers jumped out to early leads, but the Crimson stayed within striking distance, and both matchups came down to the final pairings.
No. 8 co-captain Walter Peppelman and No. 12 junior Steven Keith won both of their matches, while four other Harvard wrestlers recorded a win on the day.
The Crimson began the day with a road trip to Providence, where the team took on its Ivy League foe, the Bears.
After traveling back to campus, Harvard prepared to face the Terriers in a night match for the Charles Cup trophy.
With the score at 18-17, the match came down to the heavyweights. BU's Kevin Innis got the first takedown, but an escape by the Crimson freshman David Ng put their score at 2-1. With the crowd excitement escalating, both wrestlers kept making tries at their opponent's legs. But in the end, Innis recorded two more takedowns, and BU came out with the win.

Professor David A. Edwards is at it again. Having already developed creations that include inhalable chocolate, inhalable caffeine, and a tuberculosis vaccine in the form of a spray, the innovative biomedical engineer from Harvard is now introducing WikiCells: a new edible packaging technology that allows individuals to eat and transport food without plastic.
"The idea was to try to create a bottle which was based on how nature creates bottles," Edwards said of his motivation for developing WikiCells, citing grapes as an example of one of nature's "bottles." WikiCells imitate such natural packaging by enclosing food and liquid in an edible membrane. This membrane, which is comprised of a charged polymer and food particles, is in turn protected by a hard shell which can be broken away much like that of an egg.
Edwards and his team have thus far developed a variety of different platforms for WikiCells, which can be served as meals, drinks, and snacks. Edwards described a few of the WikiCells that his team has created: a tomato membrane containing gazpacho soup that can be poured over bread, an orange membrane filled with orange juice that you can drink with a straw, smaller grape-like membrane holding wine, and a chocolate membrane containing hot chocolate. "There's an infinite variety [of possibilities]. People can make whatever they want," Edwards said.
Edwards explained that he plans to develop WikiCells further so that they will someday be commercially available to the broader public. "In the near term, we will be encountering Wikicells in restaurant settings," he said. After that, Edwards plans to expand WikiCells to specialty stores and supermarkets. Eventually, he even hopes to develop a product platform for WikiCells, which would allow individuals to produce their own edible bottles. "People in a village in Africa could become plastic bottle-free and make things for themselves. It's really exciting from a humanitarian point of view."
