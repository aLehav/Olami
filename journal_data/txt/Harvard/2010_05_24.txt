After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A report written by Harvard Lecturer Joshua Humphreys and issued by the Center for Social Philanthropy at the Tellus Institute suggests that the “higher-risk, higher-return” manner in which the University invests its endowment has worsened the financial crisis.
In the 2009 fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment decreased 26 percent—roughly 11 billion dollars—due to the national market crash in the fall of 2008.
The report, titled “Educational Endowments and the Financial Crisis: Social Costs and Systemic Risks in the Shadow Banking System” states that  university endowments that engaged in high-risk investments “played a role in magnifying certain systemic risks in the capital markets.”
The paper, which was released on Thursday, examines five other private universities in New England in addition to Harvard. Funded by the Service Employees International Union, the report alleges that university administrators have often allowed members of the finance and alternative investment industries to become trustees with authority over the university’s endowment, representing a conflict of interest.
But according to University Spokesman John D. Longbrake, these concerns are “not new.”
“Virtually every issue raised by this report about endowment management practices has been addressed and continue to be addressed by the current leadership team at the Harvard Management Corporation,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Harvard’s large and positive economic impact to the region is well documented, and we consider it an important outcome of fulfilling our teaching and research mission.”
But Humphreys disagreed. “I’m delighted to have our diagnosis of the many problems with the endowment model ratified, but it’s just not true that everything is being addressed,” he wrote in an e-mail.
The report suggests that risky investment practices have already had both short-term and long-term consequences for local communities.
The report proposes that Harvard’s 310 cost-reducing layoffs resulted in a $53,709,863 loss and deepened the recession for the local economy.
The report also estimates that Harvard’s halt on the construction of the Science Complex in Allston will result in more than $860 million in losses in expected economic activity over the next three years.
Allston resident Harry Mattison said that the report’s findings were not surprising to him, because “Allston residents see and live these broken promises every day.”
“Walking past the empty buildings, it’s more depressing than the numbers of the report,” Mattison said. “It’s seeing the abandonment of the neighborhood—that’s experiencing it in the flesh.”
Wayne M. Langley, director of higher education for SEIU Local 615, said that SEIU commissioned the report to determine the implications of major universities’ financial situations, which affect many of the union’s members.
Langley added that he believes the universities were not the “victims that they pretended” to be in the financial crisis. “I hope it leads to real debate about who was responsible and how to protect loyal staffs, both union and non-union, who bore the brunt of this.”

CORRECTION: May 24, 2010
An earlier version of the May 24 news article "Study: Colleges Caused Financial Crisis" stated that in the 2009 fiscal year, Harvard’s endowment decreased by about 11 million dollars. In fact, the endowment decreased by about 11 billion dollars.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Diana C. Wise ’09-’10, a History and Literature concentrator, has been awarded the 2010 Captain Jonathan Fay Prize for her senior thesis. She was selected for this honor from among this year’s 89 Thomas T. Hoopes Prize winners.
The Fay Prize, which is annually awarded by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, is bestowed on the senior who has produced “the most outstanding imaginative work or original research in any field,” according to the Institute’s website.
“I felt astonished and overwhelmed, and just extraordinarily gratified that my thesis was recognized in such a way,” Wise said.
In her thesis, titled “Mere Trifles: Lord Hervey’s Memoirs and the Significance of the Insignificant,” Wise philosophically examined the contradictory relationship between triviality and essentiality in the writings of Lord Hervey.
“For instance, in the court, a courtier’s position was meant to be trifling amusement,” she said. “And yet in order to ensure...that you kept making your way up the echelons of power, you had to also make yourself essential.”
Wise, who will receive a $4,000 monetary award as part of the Fay Prize, will attend Cambridge University next year in pursuit of a M.Phil. in medieval studies.
Friends of Wise said that they are not surprised by her achievement.
“There’s no one who I’m less surprised to hear that they won,” said Ari R. Hoffman ’10, who has known Wise since their freshman year. “But there’s also no one who I think deserves it more and [better] represents what I think Harvard students should be.”
Julia E. Schlozman ’09, another friend, said she was impressed with Wise’s relentless devotion to her academic work, referring to her as “an extraordinarily brilliant Energizer Bunny.”
“I would really, really love to live inside her mind,” Schlozman said of Wise. “She’s just such an interesting and quirky thinker.”
Two other seniors received honorable mention from the Fay Prize selection committee for their theses. Daniel M. Bear ’10 was recognized for his work in Molecular and Cellular Biology, and Molly R. Siegel ’10 for her History of Science thesis.
“I was just so impressed by the work of everyone I talked to, so it was a major surprise to me to know that I’d been singled out for anything,” said Bear, whose research on neurons and gene expression has been published in the scientific journals Nature and Neuron.
Siegel said that the Fay Prize honorable mention was a reaffirmation of her academic work. “I think a lot of times when you’re doing academic work it’s hard to see an end to it,” she said. “But then when other people in academia read it and like it, it’s very reassuring.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ever since Rebekah Maggor came to Harvard in 2004 to help international students with classroom communication, she has been expanding the public speaking resources available to the Harvard community. As founding director of the Program in Speaking and Learning, she launched Expository Writing 40–the “Public Speaking Practicum”–created the Speaking Tutor program, and worked with course instructors to incorporate speaking into their curricula.
Although Maggor is leaving her post next year, students have taken up her cause, founding a group called Harvard Speaks! to promote public speaking opportunities on campus.
Meanwhile, the Office of Undergraduate Education is faced with the question of how to maintain the programs Maggor initiated and ran.
“This is a hard moment to find extra resources, but I’d love it if we had some kind of program for public speaking,” says Associate Dean of Undergraduate Education Noel Bisson. “We’ve had one really fantastic person and we’re in the process of figuring out how to cobble together those duties in the future.”
SPEAKING AND THINKING
Enrollment in Expos 40 is limited to  12 students, though in its inaugural session last year it had 80 applicants, and this year it had 104.
The small class size is necessary so that students can give individual feedback to one another, Maggor says.
“You can’t learn how to speak intelligently without learning how to listen critically,” she says. “After a presentation, I’ll ask the other students ‘what was the main argument? Could you follow the logic? How were the main points substantiated?’ This is training them to listen critically.”
She is adamant that “public speaking” encompasses a much broader range of skills than is generally perceived.
“There’s a link between clear speaking and clear thinking-when you reach the point that you can teach something to someone, that’s when you understand it,” Maggor says, explaining that the way scientists, politicians, and friends communicate affects their work and relationships.
Expos 40 alum and Speaking Tutor Jarell L. Lee ’10 says the skills he gained in the class aided him in job interviews and will be important when he begins his job with Teach for America in the fall.
He adds that peer feedback and reviewing footage of his speeches in Expos 40 taught him to structure his thoughts in a more effective and organized way, “whether I’m arguing with my friends about who’s better, LeBron or Kobe, or whether it’s in the classroom.”
Four Expos 40 graduates have become Speaking Tutors, whose job is to counsel students on any type of oral presentation or interview they need assistance with. The first tutor was former Undergraduate Council President Andrea R. Flores ’10, who spoke as a tutor to many classes and groups about effective communication.
“Public speaking is not simply about making persuasive speeches or getting an A on a presentation, it is about being able to organize your thoughts, and argue them effectively in any situation,” she wrote in an e-mail, emphasizing the importance of preserving the tutor program.
TEACHING THE TEACHERS
As part of the Program in Speaking and Learning, run by the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning,  Maggor also coached teaching fellows and professors, explaining ways to effectively communicate and to incorporate debates or oral presentations into classes.
While Bisson said the college will do its best to preserve Expos 40 and the Tutors, Maggor’s work with teaching fellows and professors faces a less certain fate. Maggor’s resources were already spread thin.
“There’s an enormous demand,” she says. “This past year, grad students had to wait two to three months to schedule a coaching session.”
“I think the main problems are scale and visibility,” says Visiting Professor in English David Zarefsky, of Harvard’s public speaking resources. “For twelve students a year to be able to take a public speaking course is just a drop in the bucket compared to what students would like to have.”
But Zarefsky, a professor of argumentation and debate at Northwestern who taught two rhetoric classes this spring, acknowledged that Harvard is doing the best it can on a budget, for example by working speaking into already-established classes and looking to expand the speaking tutors program.
Some existing courses integrate public speaking components in subtle ways; for instance, seminars like Human Evolutionary Biology lecturer Judith F. Chapman’s seminar on Human Sexuality. In the course, different students teach material to the class each week through oral and visual presentations.
“You really get to know what you find useful in a presentation,” says Elizabeth C. Balaconis ’10, a student who took the seminar this past spring.
SPEAKING UP
This spring, six freshmen joined together to promote speaking resources at Harvard, gathering support on Facebook and through e-mails. Their group, Harvard Speaks!, does not yet have an official adviser or funding.
Harvard Speaks! hosted a Speak-a-Thon in May in which about 15 students practiced various forms of oration, including a presentation on the history of kissing, recitations of original poetry, and monologue performances.
One of the organizers, Sarah C. Stein Lubrano ’13, says she found the speakers’ enthusiasm encouraging.
“We want [public speaking] more integrated into the curriculum of classes,” she says. “Gen Ed may be the best avenue because it’s still forming.”
Bisson said that her goals and the goals of Harvard Speaks! are very similar—keep Expos 40 alive, encourage speaking exercises in many classes, and sustain the Speaking Tutors program.
But the realistic time frame for these goals may be longer than students wish.
“Sometimes when you hear from the administration ‘yes, we believe in this and we want to make it happen,’ the timeline may not match the needs of the students,” she says.
“It’s a great idea, and we absolutely should support and foster good speaking in our students,” Bisson adds. “But how to help students on skills not only for formal public speaking but also for oral communication in a section setting, for instance, is a challenge. We just don’t have the funds to hire 50 Rebekah Maggors.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
University President Drew G. Faust announced last week that she would elevate global health to a University-wide priority with the promotion of the Harvard Institute for Global Health (HIGH) to permanent institute status.
Faust also announced the appointment of Public Health professor Sue J. Goldie as the director of the Institute, calling the change a “moment of special possibility for global health, both in the world and here at Harvard.”
HIGH seeks to train individuals interested in the field of public health, conduct research, and encourage engagement with issues in the field.
Harvard’s many different units engage with issues relevant to global health on a daily basis—whether researching the effects of HIV/AIDS in Botswana, training doctors in Cambridge, or making research available to policy makers.
This latest effort aims to bring together those units into a more cohesive whole.
“What Harvard brings to the table is the unique ability to leverage the breadth, scope and strength of the University to establish a ‘field of global health,’” HSPH Dean Julio Frenk wrote in the Institute’s annual report for 2009.
Recent years have seen an uptick in activity at the University surrounding global health.
In 2007, the University approved a secondary field in health policy for undergraduates, and during the same period, the number of courses offered in the field markedly increased.
Earlier this year, the University rallied around relief efforts in Haiti, in large part driven by the work of Professor Paul E. Farmer, whose non-profit Partners In Health played a key role in providing health care for victims of January’s earthquake.
Farmer will help lead HIGH’s professional training and education programs.
Faust has often said that she hopes to break down barriers among units across the University.
Last week’s initiative is emblematic of that effort, seeking to bring together different disciplines, schools, and departments to tackle global health.
“We need to support the very best researchers and the work of our outstanding faculty, in fields stretching across the spectrum of inquiry from immunology to epidemiology, health policy, history, molecular biology, and philosophy,” Faust wrote in the press release.
“We’re better when we’re more integrated as opposed to less integrated,” said professor David M. Cutler ’87, who will direct undergraduate and graduate programs in global health for the Institute. “That’s what we have to do.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson's roving reporter took to the streets to see what people thought of former Harvard student Adam B. Wheeler's unveiling as a fraud who lied his way into college. See what people had to say:
Justin A. Lavner, works in Boston
RR: How do you think he did it?
JAL: I have wondered that exact thing! I have no idea—as an outsider, you wonder the extent to which people actually look into applications.
RR: Do you think that this problem is unique to the Ivy League?
JAL: Well, I don’t think that it is a rampant problem in general. I would say that embellishment happens at the same frequency at all schools.
RR: What do you think should be his penalty?
JAL: Restitution and definitely community service. Maybe a little jail time.
Sutlana Revina, Chicago resident visiting Harvard
RR: What do you think of the Adam Wheeler story?
SR: Sucks to be him.
RR: How do you think he did it?
SR: He got lucky.
RR: Do you think it happens frequently at Harvard that people lie on their resumes?
SR: I wouldn’t say [this happens] frequently. The Admissions office was not careful enough.
RR: Do you think that the charges that he is facing are appropriate?
SR: [His penalty] should be weighed for his crimes...it depends on how much he gained from it really; 25 years is a lot.
RR: How do you think he got away with it for such a long period?
SR: It’s a combination—that he wasn’t checked out thoroughly, and he is a good liar. Some people just have that skill.
Melinda E. Kurtzky, Kennedy School student
RR: How much have you been keeping up with the Adam Wheeler story?
MK: Well I see it a lot on the blogs, and I have read a couple of blurbs.
RR: Do you think that this was the fault of the Office of Admissions?
MK: I think that the administration should always be careful...every admissions process should be rigorous and thorough.
RR: What do you think the effect of this case will be?
MK: Stories like this always get published on the blogs. It becomes a check for the administration so the next person who wants to do this will be deterred.
RR: What do you think should be his penalty?
MK: I think that he has already paid a huge penalty by having his name dragged in the mud.
RR: Do you think that this sort of fraud is a common problem?
MK: Well I don’t think that people put nearly as much effort into their lies as he did.
 
Fei Gong, Cambridge resident
RR: Are you following the Adam Wheeler story?
FG: Yes, I am following the story. I just saw the title on the Internet.
RR: What do you think about it?
FG: I think that it’s absolutely wrong. But also, this person has a lot of imagination.
RR: Do you think the administration pays enough attention to this sort of thing?
FG: I don’t know if it’s technically possible to check every piece of paper if it is correct. At least for SAT scores it is important to check.
RR: Do you think this happens a lot at Harvard?
FG: I don’t think its a common thing. I believe most of the students are truthful.
Tarik Umar ’10
RR: What do you think about the Adam Wheeler ordeal?
TU: It was shocking to hear about it.
RR: Do you think the administration is to blame?
TU: I haven’t dissected it—how responsible are the admissions staff? We have a relationship of trust and we don’t approach applicants with distrust.
RR: How do you think he did it?
TU: I don’t know...I’m surprised it lasted this long...if people do something wrong over and over again, they are going to get caught.
RR: Do you think other people at Harvard do this sort of stuff?
TU: I would be shocked if other people [who do this] didn’t get caught.

Dorm crew workers—toting buckets, mops, and brooms—are charged with the arduous task of cleaning every single room on campus in just a few short weeks. So how exactly does this happen? On Friday, May 2, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., we documented the  start-to-finish cleaning of Holworthy 16. Watch this time-lapse video to see how it  happened.

Many have reacted with shock to the case of Adam B. Wheeler, but lying students being caught while trying to gain entrance to elite  universities is nothing new. Here's a recap of similar events in the  recent past.
In 2007, Azia Kim was caught impersonating a  Stanford student for over eight months before being caught by university  officials. She was forced to leave campus, but did not face any  charges.
In 2006, Akash Maharaj was accepted as a  transfer student to Yale with perfect As in the 18 courses on his  Columbia transcript and an extremely positive recommendation from a  professor in the department of Slavic languages and literatures. The  problem was, as the Yale Daily News points out, "none of it was true."  He was later convicted of stealing $31,000 in scholarships from Yale.
 
Between  2002 and 2005, Esther E. Reed attended  Harvard as Natalie Bowman before attending Columbia as Brooke  Henson. She was later featured on "America's Most Wanted" and is  currently serving a four-year prison sentence.
In 1995, Gina Grant, an all-star student at  Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, was accepted to join the Harvard  Class of 1999. On her application, however, she failed to mention that  she had bludgeoned her abusive, alcoholic mother to death with a crystal  candlestick at age 14. Though the case was sealed, letters began to  flow to the Boston Globe after she was featured in an article about  successful, under-resourced students. The College  rescinded her offer of admission.
Also in 1995, Lon “L.T.” Grammer was  expelled from Yale and charged with larceny after it was revealed that  he had forged parts of his transfer application. He was revealed as a  fraud after his former roommate overheard him bragging about fooling the  Yale Office of Admissions and reported him to the Yale Police  Department.
In 1991, James Hogue, age 31, was expelled  from Princeton and convicted of forgery, wrongful impersonation and  falsifying records. He was later convicted of stealing over $50,000 in  gemstones from the Harvard Mineralogical Museum.
 
 In  1976, Patrick McDermit was  admitted to Yale "under the fictitious alter-ego of a 23-year-old  Shumash-Jewish multi-millionaire named Andreas Alrea." As he told the  Yale Daily News shortly after his expulsion from Yale in 1977, "the sum  of what I told them and what I sent them was so fantastic that they  couldn’t fail to believe me.”

Can't wait to hear those speeches? We couldn't either. So we sat down with Ivy Orators Alexandra A. Petri '10 and James M. Wilsterman '10 (also former Crimson editors) and Harvard Orator MacKenzie Sigalos '10 to ask their thoughts five topics drawn from a given list of 20. (We also contacted the other Harvard Orator, Benjamin P. Schwartz '10, but he was not available.) Check out what they had to say in this video!
