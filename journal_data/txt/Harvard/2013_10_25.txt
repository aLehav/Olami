After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Remember mixtapes? Crimson Arts does. Welcome to our biweekly feature, where we create mixtapes for every emotion and every season—for breakups, breakdowns, and breakdancing. This week our mixtape is dedicated to long-distance love and longing.
They say that distance makes the heart grow fonder…but who are “they,” and what do they know? The truth is, when you’re in love, distance hurts. The longing, heartache, and nostalgia make it impossible to focus on anything besides the space separating you from the one you desire. So stop trying to study, give up on the PSET you’ve been staring at for the past hour, and lose yourself in this mixtape dedicated to your long-distance love, engineered to take you through all the aching stages of yearning you could possibly want to experience in the course of an hour.
"Into the Ocean" Blue October
When heartbroken, I am quick to revert back to my 10-year-old self—the chubby little girl who thought eating sweets and running away was the solution to all of my problems. Unfortunately, fleeing has yet to fix anything (although chocolate still works wonders). “Into the Ocean” captures this fruitless desire, lyricizing the conflict between trying to escape the pangs of your heart while being unable to run from your own probing thoughts.
"Set the Fire to the Third Bar" Snow Patrol
I am a firm believer in the curing effects of crying.  In fact, when running doesn’t work, the only logical thing to do is curl up in fetal position and have a good sob. The haunting soprano of Martha Wainwright paired with Snow Patrol’s poignant lyrics literally about lying on the ground in grief make “Set the Fire to the Third Bar” a chilling song that invokes a sense of yearning so strong that the tears are sure to come…and keep coming.
"Bloom," The Paper Kites
“Bloom” by The Paper Kites repeatedly asks the question you’ve been obsessing over: “Can I be close to you?”  The song’s serene “oohs” create the feeling of a lullaby, perfect for contemplating how to make the answer to that ever present question a resounding “yes.”
"Thousand Miles," Aunt Martha
With only the picking of a guitar and a lone, vulnerable voice, Aunt Martha’s newest single is raw and authentic.  The line “Everything I wanted is a thousand miles away,” is sung over and over, each time hitting with a tragic realness. Aunt Martha keeps you honest with yourself, deflating you at the mere possibility of feeling happy to remind you that a part of you is missing and you want it back.
"Keep Your Head Up," Ben Howard
Wallowing in your sorrows, while necessary, can only last so long.  Still, listening to upbeat music on my darkest days just brings me down even more. “Keep Your Head Up” by Ben Howard perfectly blends an uplifting message with melancholic tones. Here’s the song to kick you out the door after a crying bender or a Skype marathon that’s left your eyes burning from computer glare.
"Dead Hearts," Stars
There is something incredibly intimate about Stars’ “Dead Hearts.”  Through its conversational structure, the song gives a glimpse inside a “real” relationship full of uncertainty yet brimming with lust. Its hushed tone encapsulates the fragility of a love separated by not only distance but also the doubts that plague too much time apart.
"To Build a Home," The Cinematic Orchestra
Listening to the driving strings in the chorus of “To Build a Home” makes me think of movement—the turning of wheels or running through fields—to meet the person I’ve been missing.  Paired with its slow, wistful verses, this song is ideal for long spells of daydreaming.
"Swallowed in the Sea," Coldplay
Coldplay is always my go-to in times of distress. The cryptic metaphors, passionate vocals, and building guitars of “Swallowed in the Sea” act as an emotional detox, making every one of your feelings pour out all at once. Hope, agony, and desire all flood over you listening to this underrated track.
"Home," Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros
The perfect song to reminisce to, “Home” allows you to laugh at all of the old jokes that only you and your love would understand. Through the five minutes of whistling, tambourine, and belting, this song summarizes the one thing you want: to be “home,” back with your other half.
"You and I," Ingrid Michaelson
Sure, Ingrid Michaelson may rhyme “France,” “dance,” and “ants,” but “You and I” is no joke. While its overwhelmingly lovely, whimsical lyrics and strumming ukulele may only deepen the wounds of heartbreak, this tune’s sweet outlook on the future reminds you that blue skies will surely come again.
"Time to Run," Lord Huron
Despite the sorrow distance may bring, no number of miles can silence love. “Time to Run” will make you want to jump up out of the fetal position and proclaim that though he or she may be far away, you have found the one.
"Rivers and Roads," The Head and the Heart
Though it begins softly, I cannot listen to “Rivers and Roads” without belting out its final chorus.  The song continuously builds from a humble, folksy tune to one of sheer, unashamed determination. “Rivers and Roads” is the be-all-end-all of long-distance love songs as it takes you through all of your melodramatic, histrionic, yet totally necessary phases: the mourning, contemplation, hopefulness, and finally, the resolve to persevere until a better day.

French photographer Sophie Calle has returned to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to photograph the empty spaces left by the art thefts of March 18, 1990. “Sophie Calle: Last Seen,” is a study of the legacy left by the 13 stolen works and is on display in the Hostetter Gallery at the ISG from Oct. 24th to March 3rd. “Through [Calle’s works], we have found a way of dealing with the theft, which is like an open wound,” says Pieranna Cavalchini, Tom and Lisa Blumenthal Curator of Contemporary Art at the ISG.
Interestingly, “Last Seen” stems from Calle’s personal connection to the stolen pieces. One of Calle’s favorite works, “The Concert” by Jan Vermeer, was one of the works stolen in the 1990 raid, in which two men disguised at Boston police officers entered the museum, tied up the guards, and stole 13 pieces of art. After hearing about the disappearance of “The Concert,” Calle visited the museum to photograph the outcome of the robbery and to record the responses of those working at the ISG to the theft. Last year, the museum invited Calle to return and revisit the project, this time in response to the 1995 decision to re-hang the frames of the lost paintings, more distinctly marking their absence. In this more recent series, entitled “What Do You See?” Calle photographed the empty frames and interviewed staff and visitors’ responses to the question “What do you see?” to investigate the way in which the empty frames conveyed the significance of absence.
The exhibit is separated into two rooms, one of which displays the original “Last Seen…” images, the second of which exhibits the five photographs of her more recent project. While this is not the debut showing of either of these sets of photographs, this is the first time they have all be displayed together—made possible by the construction of the new wing of the museum in 2012.
Cavalchini and Anne Hawley, Norma Jean Calderwood Director of the ISG Museum, both believe the exhibit has a dual functionality: to conserve the memory of those stolen works, and to allow creativity and beauty to stem from the painful loss of the theft. While Cavalchini describes the project as a way to show what was in the frames and make sure they are not forgotten, Hawley perceives a more universal meaning. “Through these works, Sophie has demonstrated the power of art and the artist to heal,” she says.
Quotes from staff and visitors to the museum, recorded and edited by Calle, are displayed in frames next to the photographs. The responses shown alongside her original photographs describe the missing works and convey the loss and sadness of the museum staff; in her “What Do You See?” series, however, Calle extended her interviews to members of the public  and asked them what they saw without mentioning that the painting were missing. The anonymous responses she chose to display vary from poignant to almost comical: “This Rembrandt painting looks sort of like wallpaper,” one response reads.
This documentarian aspect to the project makes Calle seem a detective of sorts; however, Calle describes her work as not journalistic, but poetic. She selected and edited the responses she received, excluding those with similar sentiments in order to convey the variation of responses to the loss of the works. Since all responses are anonymous, there is no indication of whether, or to what extent, the artist may have edited the words of her interviewees, which the exhibition program describes as a key element to the work. “There is no knowing, in other words, where the border between truth and fiction lies in these projects,” it reads.
Her ability to manipulate the texts is the only real evidence of the artist’s hand in the project, since in neither series is there any indication as to how Calle herself responds to the loss. “If I wanted people to know what I see, I would have done that,” Calle says. “It’s not about me.”
The frames remain empty on the wall of the museum today in accordance with Isabella Stewart Gardner’s will, which states that none of the works may be moved from their original position. “But through this exhibit, [Calle has] brought new life to the missing works.” Cavalchini says. “The ISG is an institution that will frame absence.” Calle has turned this absence into a work of art in itself.

Not too far from Cambridge is the Orchard House, the home of famed Massachusetts author Louisa May Alcott and the inspiration for her 19th-century novel “Little Women.” This beloved classic was adapted as a musical in 2004. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production about the famous March sisters will run from Thursday to Nov. 9 in Farkas Hall.
Co-producer Katherine L. Price ’14 sees the show’s historical significance as an asset. “It’s a modern day classic: a story that everybody knows, made contemporary by the music,” she says.
The story follows the March sisters—Jo (Taylor K. Phillips ’15), Beth (Olivia R. Miller ’16), Amy (Page Axelson, a senior at Reading Memorial High School ) and Meg (Tess V. Davison ’16)—as well as their mother Marmee (Charlotte L. McKechnie ’15) and their neighbor Laurie (Jeremy Y. Venook ’15). The adventures, revelations, and tribulations of the close-knit sisters and their community in Concord, Mass make up the plotline.
Of central focus in much of the musical is the character of Jo, an American literary heroine, whose legendary pluck and determination are only enhanced by the musical score and staging. Price notes that Phillips’s performance of “Astonishing” at the end of the first act is a show highlight. 
“That’s the thing I like about the show,” Phillips says. “You get to see the reasons why she is so fearless.”
Although the story was written over a century ago, the cast and crew attest to the enduringly relatable themes as a major takeaway. 
“It resonates especially with the Harvard community,” director Alexandra M. Kiley ’15 says. “It’s all about what it means to make it, how you can define your own success, and how to balance what you want to do professionally with what you want personally.”

For quite some time, I’ve been dabbler in what is broadly called “the bioanthropology blogosphere.” It’s one of the Internet’s strangest most provocative corners—abounding with intellectual polymaths, ideological singletons, and, very disconcertingly, more than a few unreconstructed racists. Its cast of characters, endowed with a flair for the interdisciplinary, have supplied me with both an obsession with historical population genetics and a thesis topic in intellectual history.
What binds together a good majority of bioanthro writers, from the sloppiest to the most precise, is a cultural-political identification with the secular Right. Their atheism and belief in evolution sets them apart from their fellow conservatives (only 37 percent of whom admitted in 2005 to believing in evolution); their wariness of universalistic humanism and persistent consideration of evolution as an explanatory variable in human behavior sets them apart from secular liberals.
Despite certain sympathies, I don’t identify as a member of this camp. Nonetheless, I very much value many of its critiques of baseless liberal globalist conventional wisdom—such as the claim, advanced decade after decade, that the world is becoming overpopulated. By now, mainstream outlets yielded to complicating the myth: if you read, you now know that Italy, Russia, and the Ukraine are on the verge of shrinking. In Japan, well-heeled “herbivorous” men and women are dragging the population growth rate into negative territory. But breathe easy, they write: by first-world standards, America is as fecund as you’d want it to be.
What they haven’t told you, and what you need to know, is that secular liberal American families are going the way of the Ukrainian too, if the trend lines are to be trusted.
When fellow culturally liberal male friends admit that they’re not sure they want to have children at all, I shudder, scarcely able to relate. I want three or four or five, and strong ones. “How could I give them what they need?” they despair. As long as you’re not raising them in a state of utter deprivation, the science is clear: Your children will not want for anything essential.
Secular liberals, male and female, I urge you: fewer existential crises, more babies.
You will probably dismiss my preference for a large family as selfish: He wants more of of himself in the world—what a selfish egomaniac! (This, by the way, is the default drive state of premodern people around the world. We are creatures, remember.) But is there not something decadently selfish about not wanting children in the way? (And if it’s about overpopulation, you’re empirically wrong.) Religious conservatives, best typified by the Duggars and Haredi Jews, are held back from such vicious patterns of self-imposed infertility by leaning on celestial ideologies that ban birth control, place a divine mandate on maximum fertility, and chasten against excessive individual indulgence.
In case you’ve forgotten my cultural liberalism, I remind you that I don’t recommend a backslide into religious atavism. Where I’m impressed with my ultra-Orthodox brethren’s reproductive ends, I’m not seduced by their means for a second. Put another way, we need a 21st-century reproductive ideology that makes room for birth control, gender egalitarianism, and cultural flexibility, while placing a premium on purposeful child-rearing and family happiness. In other words, there’s no reason in our century why two moms can’t have four kids, or why Mr. Jones can’t raise a roost of half a dozen while Mrs. Jones does mergers and acquisitions.
And no, it’s not economically impossible to defy the demographic transition into oblivion. Consider Israel:through a decades’ long program encouraging reproduction and a positivistic cultural proclivity, the East Mediterranean country has pulled ahead of the entire OECD and many of its regional neighbors in terms of fertility. With secular, religious, and Arab Israelis all on average fertile above the replacement level, Israel—its per capita GDP circa $30,000—boasts a total fertility rate of 3 per woman, as opposed to comparably wealthy Italy’s 1.41 and Spain’s 1.36.
This is not to say that the Israeli model is purely transferrable: we have neither the specter of genocide hanging over our heads nor a government insensitive enough to phrase policy in terms of “demographic threats.” But more than most out there, we have the resources, the space, and the cultural pride to alter the course—even if New York’s comfortable 30-somethings never manage to fully close the gap with Utah’s modest barely-legals. If you’re still not convinced, lie back and think of a post-Tea Party Congress. And then do something about it. America will be a more tolerant, creative place thanks to your efforts.

Earlier this week, Obama delivered a defiant speech addressing the imbroglio surrounding the failed implementation of his Affordable Care Act. Immediately following his “victory” over the government shutdown, in which many Republicans attempted to topple his signature achievement from its heights, he found himself on the defensive due to the misadventures of his own administration. The reaction to his speech, in which the president refused to acknowledge the severity of the bugs plaguing healthcare.gov, was swift and uncompromising.  The editorial boards of America’s three national newspapers, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today, each criticized the president on the day after his remarks, and the capital’s own Washington Post refused to exculpate Obama from “self-imposed incompetence.”
That the nation’s top media outlets refused to sugarcoat the failings of the president and his administration is a welcome sign. However, while the reactions of editorial boards and other card-carrying members of the punditocracy have not spared Obama from ultimate blame, critiques from each side do not manage to escape the inevitability of political spin. While opinion writers on the right use the website snafu as a prime example of the central government’s inability to administer an entire country’s healthcare industry, editorialists on the left view the blunder as an infuriating road bump with the potential to derail their prized progressive triumph. These reactions are not surprising, nor are they necessarily unpersuasive. But these boilerplate responses do demonstrate the media’s unalloyed tendentiousness and overarching refusal to address concerns beyond those that come straight from their respective talking points.
Obamacare has problems. More specifically, these problems reside in the elegantly named Obamacare website, on which America’s uninsured are expected to enter into the newly created healthcare exchanges. As such, while the relationship of this particular failure with the viability of the entire law is certainly relevant to national discourse, this should not take away from discussing the immediate issue—simplistically put, the government does not know how to create a website.
Harry Reid was referring to potential ACA enrollees when he explained away user difficulty with the portal, dismissively commenting, “If you’re over age 50, the Internet is something that you’re just learning about.” The Senate Majority Leader is not incorrect in this statement, although he would have a better grasp on its salience if he had made it while looking into a mirror. After all, Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, who was ultimately in charge of the healthcare rollout, is 65. Obama is 52. (And Reid is 73). No matter how “hip” Obama would like to be in the eyes of the youth vote, there is a strong chance that he knows less about how the Internet works than your 13-year old sister. And even on the off chance that his (staff’s) Instagram skills somehow outmatch those of your sister, I would venture to be that he knows less about the back end of computer programming than CS50 students after completing their Scratch assignments in “week 0.”
This is of course no mark against Obama. He was certainly not elected to be programmer-in-chief; even if CS aptitude had been a factor, he’d almost assuredly have had the upper hand over septuagenarian John McCain. However, this unveils an incipient issue engendered by the period shift into the Information Age—as the Internet becomes an increasingly essential component of our daily routines, the government must get with the program.
The opacity with which President Obama has treated the issues facing healthcare.gov is shameful, especially as the oft-repeated claim that the errors have resulted purely from traffic has been debunked. However, the president likely hasn’t a clue what an “834 EDI transmission” is, other than perhaps that it is thwarting the grandiosity of his achievement. For the most part, nor do we. But the fact that “traffic” is simply a more comprehensible concept does not excuse the disingenuousness of the assertion.
In its editorial on the matter, the New York Times opined, “The administration created the Web site so the buck necessarily stops with high officials—Kathleen Sebelius, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and President Obama himself.” Sebelius initially refused to testify on the glitches, prompting calls for her resignation. While she now has agreed to answer questions before Congress, it is difficult to imagine what she can possibly say. How much does she know about the actual issues facing the site? There is no doubt that the House of Representatives received more substantive information from the contractors tasked with creating the site. While their testimonies offered juicy accounts of not being given enough time by the administration, they serve only to “pass the buck.” This is easy for them to do, considering they are not government officials and are not held publicly accountable.
It makes sense that Sebelius and Obama be held accountable—if even for the fact that they really did not heed the concerns of their programmers. But who were they to really know? As technology becomes integrated into other aspects of government, we need people in positions of authority to understand it. (Maybe Zuckerberg and Gates should advocate for teaching coding in government agencies rather than schools). One day, society will be such that the president and Secretary of Health and Human Services will have impeccable comprehension of computer programming. In the interim, let’s at least put someone in charge.

In 1636, the Puritans established Harvard College to train clergymen for the young Massachusetts Bay Colony. Since then, the College has modified its religious flavor (Henry Ware, a Unitarian, became Hollis Chair of Divinity in 1805) as well as its religious fervor—the school we attend today is a secular institution. But the puritanical zeal of the men for whom our Houses and streets are named appears not to have loosed its grip on Cambridge culture: Harvard Square nightlife leaves a lot to be desired.
That, at least, was true until recently. The arrival of national chains in the Square marked the beginning of a process of gentrification. Eateries with extended hours, like Tasty Burger and Insomnia Cookies, have increased the variety of dining options available to residents after dark. And as The Boston Globe reports, hangouts like the Beat Hotel on Brattle Street and The Sinclair on Church Street (also a concert venue) have animated the area. Restaurant openings, liquor licenses, long hours, and live entertainment can mean only good things for fun and culture around Harvard.
Cambridge’s historically lackluster nightlife is in line with that of the Boston area as a whole. Boston is held back, at least in some measure, by institutionalized temperance: Legally, last calls must be made before 2 a.m.; buses and the MBTA stop running at 12:45 a.m.; and anyone who has tried to return to the Square in the early hours of the morning knows how hard it can be to get a cab. A 1984 law (coincidentally Orwellian, we think) that outlawed happy hours throughout the Commonwealth is also partially to blame.
Given such obstacles, it is easy to see why nightlife in Boston, even with its hordes of young people, lags behind a city like New York’s: Boston lacks the infrastructure to facilitate intoxication and transportation (responsible intoxication and transportation, of course). We hope the transformation of the late night scene in Cambridge is both lasting and effective, and that it can serve as an example—perhaps, of a shining city upon a hill—to the rest of the metropolitan area.
Harvard’s orthodox Calvinist forebears might not have been pleased with this development; they’d likely have condemned the trend toward after-hours fun as illustrative of the debauched nature of human character. To that we say—fine. If we are predestined for hell, so be it. But we are stopping at Shake Shack along the way.

Harvard University Dining Services brought its usual weekday offerings up on a notch on Thursday in celebration of National Food Day, serving New England fare like Maine lobster bisque, spinach gnocchi, and four berry pie.
The festive menu was part of HUDS’s sixth annual New England Harvest Dinner, which coincides with National Food Day, a celebration of locally grown and sourced foods.
Crista Martin, the director of marketing and communication for HUDS, said in an email to The Crimson that festive menus or themed meals, in which the menu is focused on a specific topic, occur several times a year. At least once a year, the topic is sustainability, which Martin said is a core value of HUDS and its managing director, David P. Davidson.
“The menu is made up of many items which we feature regularly, but brought together to shape one night of local and/or sustainable foods, demonstrating how tasty sustainability is,” Martin wrote in the email.
HUDS posted signs inside of the residential dining halls advertising the New England Harvest Dinner, but many students eating in the Houses and in Annenberg did not realize that the new menu was part of a larger theme.
“I didn’t really know this was going on, and I doubt I’m alone in that,” said Nicholas J. Mahlangu ’16.
Alexander J. Rohe ’17 also said he did not hear about the event beforehand, nor does he usually think about where his food might come from.
“I mean, it’s good to have events like this where we are forced to think about where the food that we eat comes from,” Rohe said.
Despite not knowing about the connection between the New England Harvest Dinner and National Food Day, many students appreciated the menu options and praised their quality.
“Definitely the lobster soup caught my attention because we normally don’t get that, and it tastes fabulous,” Catherine Choi ’14 said. “I mean, it’s one of the best dinners we’ve ever had in Adams.”
Akshay Verma ’17 said that, as a devout vegetarian, the meal was nice for him.
“It felt like more of a homemade meal than otherwise,” Verma said. “I’ve never had meat in my life, so it was nice that there were a lot of vegetarian options today.”
Several students expressed a desire to know more about food sustainability practices after learning that the menu was in fact part of National Food Day.
“I usually don’t think twice about it,” Choi said. “As long as it looks good, I eat it, but I guess maybe I should pay more attention from now on and try to buy from more locally produced sources.”

History professor Daniel L. Smail discussed his research on the measurement and importance of time throughout history in a lecture entitled “Time Reckonings” Thursday night at the Harvard Museum of Natural History.
“One of the great stories told by history is that of how time came to be,” said Smail, who specializes in early human history. Smail’s lecture coincides with an ongoing exhibit at the Harvard Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments entitled “Time and Time Again.”
According to Smail, all of the world—from the global financial markets to a Harvard classroom—is disciplined by time.
“The way that you think about time inhabits your mind so fully that it’s hard to think of a world without time,” he said.
Referencing numerous objects displayed in the exhibit, Smail traced the evolution of time from the creation of sundials in Egypt and the use of public clocks in Europe to the development of standard time zones in the 19th century.
Smail presented simple questions that depicted the importance of time. For example, how was daily labor compensated before time clocks existed, or how were meeting times arranged when sundials indicated different times depending on one’s location?
Until sundials were phased out for water and sand clocks, Smail said, time was local—noon occurred at different “times” depending on the location of the city.
Another example Smail cited was the practice of Muslim midday prayer a thousand years ago. Due to the relativity of time measured on a sundial, these prayers began at different times across the globe.
“You would hear a wave of prayer moving across at 1,000 miles an hour [the speed of the sun] from east to west,” said Smail.
Finally, Smail also discussed the “clockification of Europe” during the 14th century. The first public clock was built in Paris in 1370, and approximately 80 public clocks were erected in European cities before the end of the century, he said.
Smail attributed this development to merchants’ need to regulate markets, a necessity augmented by the popularity and status associated with clocks during the time period.
“[The lecture] was interesting because it was a social description of time—it is something new,” said Sergio R. Zachir, who attended the event.
“This event is wonderful in that it’s bringing people to hear the story…of objects shown in our exhibition,” said Sara J. Schechner ’79, curator of the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments.
Jane Pickering, executive director of the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture, echoed the interwoven nature of Smail’s lecture, stating “we try to do programming that...builds off the content of the exhibit.”
The “Time and Time Again” exhibit will remain on display until December 6th at the Harvard Science Center.

Former mayor of Los Angeles Antonio R. Villaraigosa emphasized the nationwide need for education reform during a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum with CNN political contributor Ana Navarro on Thursday.
The discussion, which spanned topics ranging from education policy to ethnicity in politics to Villaraigosa’s family values, occurred only a day after the politician spoke at a “Conversations with Kirkland” event Wednesday evening. The events are part of Villaraigosa’s visiting fellowship at the Institute of Politics.
Navarro, a resident fellow at the IOP this fall, also hosts a study group entitled “Old, White, Straight, Male Voters Ain’t What They Used to Be.”
Throughout the conversation with Navarro, Villaraigosa discussed the structural problems in the public education system, an issue that he said was brought to the forefront during his service as mayor from 2005 to 2013 and during his previous membership in the California State Assembly. Villaraigosa said that flaws in the American education system contribute to national economic, democratic, and civil rights issues.
“Great cities are anchored by great public schools and institutions of higher learning,” Villaraigosa said. “The kids of the poor aren’t competing with those of the developing world.”
The former mayor said that changes need to implemented by administrators, parents, and teachers alike in order for education to be effective. He cited the improvements that his administration orchestrated within many schools in the L.A. public school system, particularly those in typically underachieving areas, as an example of exhaustive reform.
Max W. Liebeskind ’17 said that he attended the event in order to hear Villaraigosa’s unique perspective as a mayor, particularly on topics like education and labor unions.
“I’m a native New Yorker who was in the New York City public school system, and so I was really excited to see a leader of a major metropolitan area talk about metropolitan issues,” Liebeskind said.
Navarro and Villaraigosa also addressed hyper-political partisanship in light of the recent government shutdown. Villaraigosa said that the general population is losing faith in the government, and that he does not think members of either party understand the level of cynicism that has spread across the American public.
“That’s not healthy for democracy,” Villaraigosa said. “That’s not healthy for either party. Both parties need to push out the edges and try to forge a compromise.”
When asked whether he would pursue further political office, Villaraigosa said that while he is taking some time to reflect and regenerate, he wasn’t ruling any options out. However, he added that if he does assume political office in the future, it will be in a “transformative” role.
“And if I can’t be transformative, I’ll let someone else do it,” Villaraigosa said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Dunkin’ Donuts currently located at 1 Bow. St. will move its storefront a third of a mile eastward to 1003 Mass. Ave. within the next three months, franchise owner David G. Carvalho told The Crimson Thursday night.
Carvalho said he hopes to open the new location before officially closing the current storefront.
“Hopefully we’ll be open before we make the transfer, because we’d hate to lose customers,” he said. He added that of equal concern is ensuring that the relocation does not disrupt the steady income of Dunkin’ employees, since “it hurts peoples’ pockets when they can’t afford to pay their rent.”
The decision to relocate is the latest development in a month of uncertainty about the Bow St. store’s future in Harvard Square. After the store announced in September that it would close, it reversed those plans several days later when management reached a short-term lease agreement with the landlord to remain open for the time being.
The store’s subsequent decision to relocate was greenlighted at a public hearing Thursday. Carvalho obtained the necessary approval when the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal unanimously voted in favor of a special permit application filed by the Riverside Management Group. Carvalho works within the group, which operates Dunkin’ Donuts locations in the Greater Boston area.
At the meeting, the Board debated any potential concerns, including obstruction of traffic, commuter safety, and the visual integration of the shop’s external appearance among existing Mass. Ave. storefronts, before ultimately deciding that relocation would not cause any significant issues. The shop also agreed to use biodegradable materials in packaging and provide customers with trash receptacles inside the store.
Multiple Cambridge residents attending the meeting voiced their support for the store’s move to the planned 1,600-square-feet location, which will seat approximately 20 guests.
Karil Alexandarov, who said he attended the hearing at the request of his wife, expressed his delight that the Dunkin’ Donuts will be kept in the area.
“[My wife] is a victim of the french vanilla,” he said. “I hope this will bring some life in the area, so she doesn’t have to go down all the way down to JFK Street or Central Square.”
When Dunkin’ Donuts departs from the corner of Mass. Ave. and Bow Street, it will leave behind the storefront where it found a certain fame in a scene in the 1997 film “Good Will Hunting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard School of Public Health has set a goal of $450 million for its subset of the University’s capital campaign, HSPH campaign co-chair Jonathan S. Lavine announced at a gala at Revere Hotel Boston Common on Thursday evening.
Lavine also told the gathered crowd of donors and University affiliates that the campaign has raised $167 million to date, a sum that includes 25 donations of $1 million or more.
Lavine said that campaign funds would support HSPH’s efforts to hire new professors, offer better financial aid, and develop new facilities, among other improvements.
“We will transform the Harvard School of Public Health, but more importantly, equip the school for even greater impact over the next 100 years,” Lavine said at the conclusion of his remarks. “We will not only reach our financial goal but also achieve the broader ambitions of Dean [Julio] Frenk for the Harvard School of Public Health.”
The announcement comes less than two days before the expected unveiling of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ campaign target, anticipated to be announced by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith in Sanders Theatre Saturday morning.
Both campaigns are under the umbrella of the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign, the most ambitious in the history of higher education. The University announced its fundraising target during the launch of the public phase of its campaign last month, ending a two-year quiet phase during which it raised $2.8 billion in donations and pledges.
Lavine’s announcement came just hours after HSPH honored Bill and Chelsea Clinton as part of the school’s Centennial Celebration, two days of programming recognizing the School’s 100th anniversary.
Thursday night’s gala event featured speeches from prominent speakers who highlighted the four global health threats that the school hopes to use its campaign funds to address—poverty and humanitarian crises, old and new pandemics, harmful physical and social environments, and failing health systems. University President Drew G. Faust also delivered brief remarks.
On the occasion of HSPH’s 100th anniversary, Frenk emphasized the school’s priority of helping millions around the globe celebrate more birthdays in good health. He also highlighted the successes of the institution over the past century while applauding the continued commitment to excellence.
“Each generation has one overriding response: to safeguard the legacy it has been handed from previous generations and to pass it on to the next,” Frenk said. “Each of you has faced that defining choice between caring and indifference. You have made the right choice; you have chosen to care.”
Frenk stressed that the campaign would equip the University to continue the positive trajectory of the last 100 years, ensuring success for the next century.
“You’ve chosen Harvard because it’s the best place to invest in research and education,” Frenk said. “This is the chain of choice that brings you here now, and this is the chain of choice that will improve health for everyone, everywhere.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former United States President Bill Clinton took the stage at the Harvard School of Public Health’s centennial anniversary ceremony on Thursday, celebrating the success of public health policy reforms that have saved the lives of millions and expressing high hopes for the work of future generations.
“Today you have recognized through us what the Harvard School of Public Health is all about—elevating our common humanity and building networks of cooperation in a world where we are more interdependent and power is more diffuse,” said Clinton, who was one of three recipients of the school’s Centennial Award.
Thursday’s ceremony recognized the impact of four individuals who embody the “high ideals and practical determination” of the institution, Dean of HSPH Julio Frenk wrote in the program for the afternoon’s events.
Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, was the recipient of the inaugural Next Generation Award, which honors individuals under the age of 40 for their accomplishments in the sphere of public health. Frenk introduced Chelsea Clinton and unveiled a brief montage detailing her efforts to increase healthcare access in the developing world, fight childhood obesity, and address preventable diseases.
“We have not succumbed yet to cynicism, inertia, or patience,” Chelsea Clinton said to her audience. “I hope that all of us, particularly those of us who are not so young, will engage young people and listen to their voices.”
According to Frenk, the Next Generation Award was given to Chelsea Clinton for her leadership in inspiring young people to make universal health a global priority.
Frenk then announced the three recipients of the Centennial Medal, a one-time award honoring global health reform and advocacy efforts. The medal was specifically developed to commemorate the 100-year anniversary of the HSPH.
“Health for us is crucial and central, but global health is linked to human rights, education, and the environmental concerns that we are creating in the way that we are dealing with each other and with the planet,” said the first honoree Gro H. Brundtland, an HSPH graduate who formerly served as the prime minister of Norway and as the first female Director-General of the World Health Organization. “The [worst] thing that is challenging all of humanity is climate change.”
Jim Y. Kim, another HSPH graduate who currently serves as President of the World Bank Group, was the second Centennial Medal honoree.
“Your professors are going to tell you, with very good reason, to focus on a problem that is narrow with clear boundaries, so that you can get your papers published and get tenure and there is a place for that,” said Jim Kim, president of the World Bank Group. “But the one thing I would tell you is at some point to tackle the most difficult, seemingly intractable problem you can find.”
Frenk, who presented the awards on behalf of the school, said that the despite its practical difficulties, the field of public health presents an opportunity to effect widespread change.
“A fundamental dissatisfaction with the way things are and a stubborn determination to narrow the gap between what can and what is actually being achieved are important characteristics for a career in public health,” Frenk said. “To open this literally once in a century celebration, we are honored to recognize the accomplishments of four role models.”
President Clinton, the final award recipient of the ceremony, reflected on the legacy of the honorees and their impact on coming generations in his acceptance speech.
“The 21st century will truly belong to people like my daughter, of whom I’m so proud, and to the students,” said Clinton. “And those that think that what we have in common is more important than our differences”.
Though his speech was largely characterized with positivity, Clinton had to share his one true disappointment.
“You can see we’re all friends,” said Clinton of the award recipients. “The only thing we don’t have in common with the other honorees is that we don’t have degrees from Harvard. I feel kind of cheated.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Maksim Korolev of the men’s cross-country team took the honors of The Crimson’s athlete of the week for his performance at the Wisconsin Adidas Invitational this past weekend. Korolev ran an 8k course in 23:14 for the Harvard men’s cross country team, finishing 2nd out of the 288 runners participating. Although he was the best of the best this week, some other athletes were deserving of recognition for their on-field excellence as well.
James Leakos, Men’s Cross-Country
Overshadowed by Korolev’s second place finish was the other co-captain’s performance in Wisconsin. The senior crossed the finish line just 19 seconds after Korolev, which was good for 10th place overall. Out of the 36 schools represented in the race, Harvard was the only school that was able to place two runners in the top 10.
Paul Stanton Jr., Football
The Harvard sophomore running back helped pace the offensive attack en route to a 35-16 victory over Lafayette this Saturday. The halfback totaled 113 rushing yards and also added two scores to help preserve the Crimson’s perfect record on the season. Stanton has been a force all season, already having scored nine touchdowns on the season – an average of slightly less than two per contest.
Corinne Bain, Women’s Volleyball
Behind the freshman’s impressive performance, the women’s volleyball team was able to sweep its two games over the weekend. Against Penn on Friday, Bain recorded her second triple-double of the season, registering 10 kills, 22 assists and 10 digs to lead the Crimson to a 3-1 win in Philadelphia. The next day in Princeton, she duplicated her stats from the previous day, earning her third triple-double of the season to help defeat the Tigers, 3-0.

Here's this week's Quotes of the Week, the five best quotes from some of the five best sports moments of the weekend.“To have three guys under 25 minutes on the course that we’re going to be seeing in two weeks was really, really great. It bodes well for our depth, so we just have to get ready for the final push.” – Cross country coach Jason SaretskyCross country captains Maksim Korolev and James Leakos finished in the top ten in this weekend’s Wisconsin Adidas Invitational, completing the 8k course in 23:14 and 23:33 minutes respectively. As the only school to place two runners in this category, the Crimson look to prepare for the Ivy Heptagonal Championships, which will take place at Princeton next weekend. “The morale of the team is very high right now. Obviously it’s one game at a time and we don’t look too far ahead, but we had some fun today because we put in a lot of work this week.” –Joshua Boyd ‘13After two hard fought road victories, the Crimson had a somewhat easier time at Harvard Stadium Saturday defeating Lafayette 35-16. Behind the leadership of senior quarterback Michael Pruneau, who threw for 263 yards, and sophomore running back Paul Stanton, who ended the game with 113 rushing yards and two touchdowns, Harvard improved its record to 5-0. The Crimson look forward to playing against Princeton (4-1) this weekend. “We ended the first half knowing that we’d had a lot of really good chances and knowing that if we just kept playing our game and doing what we had been doing for another 45 [minutes], we’d get the results we wanted.” –Peyton Johnson ‘14 Although the Crimson got off to a shaky start in Saturday’s game, down 1-0 against the Brown Bears, the women's soccer team calmly pushed through to emerge on top. Harvard beat Brown 3-1, with goals coming from sophomore Haley Washburn, junior Marie Margolius and senior Elizabeth Weisman.“The guys are obviously fighting, and their play is improving with their fight. It’s the same thing on the practice field; it’s been our possession on training is a lot better. We’re getting a lot calmer on our attacking half. We’re executing our set pieces, so it’s good.” –Men’s soccer coach Pieter LehrerMen’s soccer beat Brown 2-1 on Saturday, winning their second consecutive game in Ivy League play. With all three goals coming in the first half, the Crimson had to maintain the intensity of play and keep their defense strong while under attack in order to secure victory.“The great thing about the Head of the Charles is [it’s] a big family reunion for all the rowers. I got to see some of my friends who row at other schools. My friend described it as a ‘Rower Christmas.’ This is my fifth year rowing here, and still having all those people cheering for you is really exciting.” –Lauren Tracey ‘16The Radcliffe heavyweight crew finished strong in the Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend, placing seventh, followed by the second varsity boat which placed 33rd, and the Black and White which entered the championship fours, placing 16th overall.

With fall sports teams looking to make a charge in the last part of the season and winter sports picking up action, this weekend is full of events for Harvard sports fans. Check out some of these home contests to cheer on the Crimson.
Football vs. Princeton: October 26, 1 PM
With an undefeated record to uphold, it is all on the line for the 5-0 Crimson as they take on the Tigers. Princeton and Harvard both head into this game undefeated by the Ivies, making Saturday’s game a battle for first place standing in the league.
Men’s Hockey vs. Bentley: October 26, 7:30 PM
The Crimson kicks off its season this weekend, taking on the Bentley Falcons on Saturday night at home. After graduating a class of six seniors this past year, including MVP Danny Biega, this season’s Harvard squad looks to adjust to the change in lineup.
Women’s Hockey v. Quinnipiac: October 25, 7 PM
Harvard women’s hockey starts out competition play with a match against fellow top-ten team Quinnipiac at home Friday night. This marks the first game the Crimson will play with junior captain Marissa Gedmen back on the ice after an injury last year. Additionally, this will be the first game the Crimson play without head coach Katey Stone in almost 18 years.
Women’s Soccer v. Princeton: October 26, 7 PM
As the Crimson fights to maintain its Ivy League winning streak, Princeton will scramble to notch its first victory in the conference. A loss in this game would mean losing first place Ivy ranking for Harvard, as well as ruining the Crimson’s longest winning streak since 2011. 
Men’s Soccer v. Princeton: October 26, 4 PM
The Crimson will look to expand its recent two game Ivy League winning streak as it faces Princeton at Soldier’s Field this weekend. To do this, the Harvard squad will have to bounce back from the devastating loss to Boston College this past Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend, the Harvard football team will play Princeton hoping for vengeance after last year's monumental loss. Read on for a a conversation with writers from The Crimson and Daily Princetonian.
Jacob D. H. Feldman, The Harvard Crimson Football Beat Writer: The wild finish to last year's game still hasn't really sunk in for me yet--the blocked kicks, odd penalties, and that last final heave. How big was that comeback in the grand scheme of the Tigers program?
Stephen Wood, Daily Princetonian Sports Editor: I can only imagine how it must have felt for Harvard to watch that final quarter. I think that game - and particularly that final heave - told the Princeton community that its football team was back. You probably remember the back-to-back 1-9 seasons, though we'd like to forget them. After those, attendance in 2012 was dismal and the fact that the Tigers had won a few games already was not enough to generate much enthusiasm on campus.
I think coach Surace and his team already knew what they were capable of (though they were still not at their best, as evidenced by, well, the entire first half), but that game announced to the rest of campus that football games would be worth going to again.
I've always wondered how much of an effect that game had on the rest of Harvard's season. Did it take the wind out of the Crimson's sails as much as everyone down here thought it did?
 
JDHF: You know, that's a great question, and a tough one to answer. The week after the Princeton game, Harvard held off Dartmouth, and then it steamrolled Columbia, 69-0, much to the chagrin of Lions coach Pete Mangurian. Then it lost to Penn in Philadelphia, though it felt like the Quakers simply outplayed the Crimson, rather than Harvard suffering from any kind of letdown. If the "Collapse in Princeton" had any effect, it refocused the team, and Harvard hasn't really had any close calls since (outside of the Penn game).
Of course on the other hand, Princeton stumbled a few times down the stretch last year. Was the anticipation still there coming into this year despite those late-season losses to Cornell, Penn, and Dartmouth?
 
SW: I think the sense was that the Harvard game was a glimpse of things to come. That view might be corrupted by hindsight now that the Tigers are off to a 4-1 start, but I do think most fans would agree that the Harvard win was more than enough to make up for the disappointing end of the season. If people didn't know what to expect right at the beginning of this season, I think they certainly have their hopes up now.
That brings me to something else I've been wondering: how are you feeling about Harvard's offense this season? I know the Crimson lost some incredible talent to graduation (and the NFL), but it looks, from here at least, as dangerous as ever right now.
Side question: Is it weird having to write about your team's mascot in the singular all the time, or is it just one of those things you get used to? I always find myself writing "they," then having to go back and change it because Crimson isn't plural.
 
JDHF: You would not have been crazy to think that losing an Offensive Player of the Year quarterback, All-Ivy running back, and NFL-ready tight end would affect Harvard's offense. But you (and me and plenty of other people) would have been wrong. The Crimson has scored at least 30 points in each game, including three 40-point performances.
The most impressive thing about it all is that a backup quarterback, backup running back, and seemingly 100 different offensive line combinations have kept up that pace over the last two weeks. Obviously these guys train tremendously hard for two and three years to be ready when their name is called, but right now, it feels like Harvard coach Tim Murphy could dig up Percy Haughton and turn him into an All-Ivy player right away.
Of course, Harvard's dominant defense has had a lot to do with all of that offensive success. Defenders have scored touchdowns in a majority of games this year, and have given the offense great field position most of the rest of the time.
The Tigers defense hasn't been too shabby either though, right? In a few words, how can you familiarize Harvard fans with Caraun Reid?
As for your other question, the Crimson singular thing is weird every time. It's almost a badge of honor to be one of the sportswriters in our building who is able to catch themselves every time. I'm not at that level yet. But hey, at least Harvard doesn't have the third-most common nickname in college sports--though I guess it is the closest Princeton will ever get to being confused for an SEC team.
 
SW: Princeton's defense has definitely done a great job considering it lost Mike Catapano, last year's Defensive Player of the Year, who now plays for the Kansas City Chiefs. Losing him may have hurt its reaction time - several times this season, the defense has come out sluggish only to figure out the offense and dominate the second half. Still, linebacker Mike Zeuli is helping replace Catapano in a breakout season, leading the team with 41 tackles. With the exception of the season-opening loss to Lehigh, the pass coverage has looked better this season thanks in part to young cornerbacks Anthony Gaffney and Dorian Williams (last week's Defensive Player of the Week).
I would use "frightening" to describe Caraun Reid, though he's a very nice guy in person. I'd also go with "huge" and "dangerous." He's the kind of guy who makes his presence felt on every play, and in addition to his ability to sack the QB he also has a penchant for blocking kicks - he blocked three in each of the last two seasons and already has one block this year.
He's also a frighteningly talented musician.
I'll grant that the Tiger is a common mascot, but picking a wild animal at random is still a better way to name a team than putting your finger down on a random spot in a book of paint samples. Plus, LSU and Auburn were copying us.
 
JDHF: Great video. Would it be wrong for me to interpret his song choice of "A Change is Gonna Come" as a message to Ivy leaders Penn and Harvard. #BulletinBoardMaterial?
Don't get me wrong: I've never been on board with Crimson. To be fair though, it wasn't chosen at random.
But enough mascot talk, let's get to some predictions. Do you think Princeton can pull off the upset two years in a row, or will Harvard reassert the superior position it held for half a decade?
 
SW: You'd have to ask Caraun about the song, but I assume that's what he was talking about.
This game is going to be crazy, but I'm predicting (shocker here) that Princeton will win. It looks like it'll be a toss-up, and, though Quinn Epperly won on a literal toss-up to Wilson last year, he's improved by leaps and bounds since. This year, the reigning Offensive Player of the Week comes into Cambridge leading the league in scoring and looking scarily accurate. Epperly has a wide range of targets, and coach Surace isn't afraid to go to ridiculous lengths (he's put three quarterbacks on the field at the same time fairly often this season) to help him confuse defenses.
Harvard is a scoring machine, but I have yet to see a defense find a way to shut Epperly down. On the other hand, Princeton's defense rarely comes out looking strong but has managed to shut down its opponent before it's too late in each of the last four games.
A few side predictions:
1) Harvard scores first
2) Win or lose, Epperly accounts for at least three touchdowns
3) If Princeton does lose, special teams mistakes will be a major contributing factor
4) There will be a lot of scoring, making it really fun to watch
I'm guessing you might have other thoughts - is the Crimson going to shake off the disappointment of last year's shocker, or will the Tigers make it two in a row for the first time in seven years?
 
JDHF: Are you ready for an absolute cop out?
SW: Go for it.
JDHF: I'm not ready to commit.
I want to hear how starting quarterback Conner Hempel is recovering from a bruised knee, and if he is able to start Saturday. Whether he plays or not, your prediction that Harvard will score first is a bold one. The Crimson offense has been slower than the original IBM PC to open games this year.
That said, I do agree that this game is going to be played in the 40s, if not the 50s. Both of these offenses can score, and score often. If Princeton pulls off another upset, it will likely be because the Harvard secondary gives up several big plays, something it has gotten better about this year.
Given that this is only Week Six, it is interesting that these teams have already played two common opponents: Brown and Lafayette. The Tigers beat both of them by a combined 38, while Harvard topped them by a combined 37. Anybody who thinks this game isn't going to be close must know something I don't, or maybe they don't know anything at all.
For all those reasons, I'm holding off on a pick right now (though I'm leaning Harvard given its 15-game home winning streak and the extra motivation from last year's loss). I guess you'll have to check my preview column Friday for my final prediction just like everybody else.
Anything else you want to add?
 
SW: Well, it sounds like we can expect some sloppy play in the first quarter and a wild ride from there. Other than that, all I have to say is I wish it weren't midterms week here because I'd much rather spend the week getting ready for the game, but I should probably spend some time studying, you know, academic stuff. I'll see you in the press box.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard women’s soccer team (8-3-2, 4-0 Ivy) lost a match was in the second week of September. On Saturday night at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium, the Crimson will look to continue to do what it has done for the past 44 days: stay perfect.
On the other side of the pitch will be Princeton (5-4-4, 0-3-1), itself no stranger to perfection. Last season, the Tigers went 7-0 in the Ancient Eight, including a 3-1 beat down of the Crimson. Harvard has not gone undefeated in the Ivy League since 1999, when it ultimately lost to Boston College in the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
“This whole season what has made us successful has been taking one game at a time and we will treat this game no differently,” co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson said. “A win this weekend would be just as big as any we have gotten so far and put us one step closer to our goal. One more game, one more mission to accomplish.”
If the Crimson wants to achieve the goal of Ivy League perfection, the squad will have to rely heavily on its high-octane offense. Harvard is averaging over two goals per game and has scored 14 times in its last four contests.
Johnson leads the team with six assists and has consistently sparked the offense throughout the season. Her ability to share the ball and find her teammates has led to a potent offense in the Ivy League this year.
“The more goals we’ve scored, the more confident we’ve become” Johnson said. “As a result of that, things are really clicking. We are playing together, and everything is becoming more fluid. We’ve worked on finishing in practice a lot more than in years past and now it’s showing on the field.”
One Crimson player who has had no trouble finishing this year is freshman forward Midge Purce. Purce leads the team in points and is currently second in the Ivy League in goals scored with eight. Coming off of a stellar week that earned her Honor Roll for Ivy League Player of the Week, Purce was named both Player and Rookie of the Week in the Ivy League two weeks ago.
Purce won’t be the only breakout freshmen on display Saturday night. Princeton boasts its own young gun in freshman forward Tyler Lussi. Lussi leads her squad with six goals and 16 points, and she has been the rare bright spot on a struggling Tigers squad. Lussi was a four-star recruit out of high school and has been named Ivy League Rookie of the Week twice.
Harvard’s defense should be up to the task, as the physicality of sophomore center defensive midfielder Haley Washburn and the ironclad performance of junior defender Erika Garcia has been tough to break through this year.
Junior defender Marie Margolius has also been a bright spot for the Crimson defense, earning Ivy League Player of the Week honors following her game winning goal over Brown last weekend. Margolius tallied three points in the Crimson’s 3-1 victory, including the game-winning goal.
Three separate goalkeepers are behind Harvard’s lockdown defense—freshman Lizzie Durack, and juniors Bethany Kanten and Cheta Emba. The three have a combined .89 goals against average, with each keeper showing the ability to make big time saves.
“This group has an exceptional amount of drive and determination,” Johnson said. “We’ve been a young team and this year our determination is really showing in our ability to close out games.”
After last weekend’s win over the Bears, Harvard has been given its first full week off without a game this month. As the team approaches the home stretch of its schedule, the veterans are most certainly grateful for a little time off.
“We get to spend more time working within our team on things that we haven’t gotten to in a while” co-captain forward Elizabeth Weisman said. “Especially those things we’ve noticed in games where we’ve struggled and now we have an opportunity to take more time to fix them and address them so that we come out stronger.”
A win Saturday night would keep the Crimson atop the Ancient Eight standings. In addition, Harvard would only need to win one of its final two games to guarantee a share of the Ivy League title, which the team last won in 2011.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes, there’s nowhere else to go but up.
Last year, the Harvard men’s hockey team finished the season 10-19-3 on its way to the first last-place finish in the Eastern College Athletic Conference in school history.
The quest for redemption begins Saturday, as the team faces Bentley at home for the second straight year at 7:30 pm.
“It’s the beginning of a new season,” senior captain Dan Ford said. “There’s a lot of new guys, and we’re excited about a fresh start against Bentley.”
The sentiment is shared by Bentley, who, after losing to the Crimson by a score of 5-0 last year, went on to finish 10th in the unremarkable Atlantic Hockey Conference.
This year, the Falcons come into Bright just off a close 4-3 loss to last year’s national championship runner-up and current No. 9-ranked Quinnipiac.
“Obviously any time you play a school like Harvard it’s exciting,” said Bentley assistant coach Matt Curley. “I think for our guys it’s a great chance to come back and have another go at it, and see if we can make amends for last year’s loss and maybe get a win this Saturday.”
Harvard’s win over Bentley last year started off the season on a high note, as highly-touted freshman forward Jimmy Vesey lived up to the hype and notched two goals and an assist in his first collegiate start.
This year, Vesey is once again expected to make an impact after an impressive rookie season in which he earned Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and a wspot on the All-ECAC Rookie team, and spent his winter break winning a U20 World Championship with the USA Junior National Team in Russia.
The forward will be joined by fellow super sophomores Brian Hart and Kyle Criscuolo, who added 18 and 13 points respectively to the Crimson offense last year.
Harvard will also look to Ford and junior standouts Patrick McNally and Max Everson as the team attempts to bounce back from a disappointing season marred by injuries and the mid-season withdrawal of several key players with a victory this weekend.
“We want to come out and make Bentley uncomfortable,” Ford said. “We want to play the way we want to play, come out with a win, and build some momentum. We’ve got a number of games right at the start of the season, so we really want to get off to a good start and build off that heading into some of our league contests.”
The Crimson is also faced with the tough task of replacing seniors Danny Biega and Marshall Everson. Biega, an All-American defenseman, played an important role on both offense and defense for Harvard, and Everson was one of the team’s top scorers, posting 11 goals and 5 assists in his final season.
“We lost a lot of players from last year’s team that played important roles, and I don’t think there’s going to be any individual guy making up for those losses,” Ford said. “It’s going to be a group effort to replace those guys.”
The effort should be helped by the new group of freshmen. The cohort makes up the top-ranked incoming rookie class in the ECAC.
Led by NHL draft picks Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone, the nine rookies make up the largest class on the Harvard roster. Unsurprisingly, they will be counted on to make an immediate impact.
While the Crimson will be playing for the first time in the 2013-2014 season on Saturday, Bentley comes into the matchup with a 1-4 record through its first five games. The Falcons will be looking to their senior leadership, including returning leading scorer Brett Gensler, to guide the team in the coming weeks and remain competitive.
“We don’t throw a lot at our guys, but one thing we do expect from them is to come ready and prepared to play from the opening whistle to the final horn,” Curley said. “It’s something they’ve been very good at thus far, and we certainly expect that Saturday.”
After having an entire summer off to ruminate on last season’s disappointments, Harvard appears ready to start proving that they’re finally ready to meet the high expectations that come with high talent.
“It’s been a long time since our last game,” Ford said. “We haven’t been able to play in about seven months. We’ve been practicing and working out here since September. I think we’re just really excited to finally play, and we’re looking forward to Saturday night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking around campus Friday, it’s easy to tell that winter is here. Yes, temperatures are dropping into the low 30s and those seersucker shorts are finally on sale, but it’s not Mother Nature or J Press that determine when fall ends. It is Harvard’s Office of Career Services.
Thursday, Oct. 24, marked the end of the fall recruiting season for on-campus interviews. The hordes of suited seniors strutting through the square have gone south for the winter. The dining halls will no longer reverberate with the sweet sounds of ridicule lobbed at students who swore they’d never go into consulting a few short months ago and now find themselves preparing for their fourth interview in four days.
But don’t fret. I have good news. A new application season starts Saturday. When the Princeton football team (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) gets off the bus at Harvard Stadium, the Ivy League will officially begin taking applications for its next gridiron champion.
Stick with me here. Some like to compare each football season to a movie script. For Harvard (5-0, 2-0 Ivy), it’s more like an application (how fitting). Over the course of 10 games, the Crimson puts together a portfolio, sometimes including brutal displays of efficiency, other times throwing in a beautifully flawed production.
While the collection is important, every experienced applicant knows his or her fate is determined by the cover letter, resume, and interview—the job hunt holy trinity. The same holds for Harvard football.
Each November, the Crimson engages in a heavyweight battle with Penn in what is often a de facto Ivy League Championship game. Harvard shows how it stacks up against its best competition in a battle of experience. Both teams demonstrate all of the skills they have learned to that point in the season. The fight with the Quakers is clearly the resume game of the Harvard schedule.
The Crimson finishes its year with its most important game. It’s called The Game for a reason. When Harvard enters the game coming off a win over Penn, it attempts to seal a successful season with a bang after establishing itself as a top applicant. When the Crimson loses to Penn, the Yale contest represents an opportunity to redeem the season and at least end on a high note. The Game is Harvard’s chance to leave a good impression, and it’s often the only time many of the people judging the team will see them in person. If you still haven’t figured out The Game’s application counterpart, you’ve clearly never had an interview.
That leaves the cover letter—often the hardest element to identify in Harvard’s schedule. But this year it’s clear.
In contrast to the interview, cover letters create first impressions. Often, they can separate contenders from pretenders in an applicant pool while offering the first chance to judge an applicant’s personality.
Facing the Tigers Saturday, Harvard will write its cover letter.
Crimson coach Tim Murphy described this week’s game as his team’s first real test of this season. Though Harvard is 2-0 in the Ivy League, both of its win have come against teams that are 0-2 in league play. Meanwhile, Princeton enters the contest as one of the three Ancient Eight teams that remain unbeaten in conference.
But this game means more than its standings implications. Last year, the Tigers scored 29 unanswered points in just over 10 minutes to pull off a stunning, 39-34 upset of the then-unbeaten Crimson. The loss would ultimately cost Harvard a share of the Ivy title.
Treavor Scales ’13 said that fourth quarter was surreal. Murphy said he didn’t eat for two days after the game.
“It was just one of those ones that you’ll just never forget,” Murphy said in the offseason.
Murphy and players are adamant that this is a different team and a different year, but it would just be flat-out wrong to categorize Saturday’s showdown as anything but a revenge game.
Given that, I don’t think it’s an overstatement to say we are going to see into the football team’s soul this weekend. OK, maybe that’s a bit much, but still. How the Crimson responds to last year’s collapse will tell us a lot about what type of team we are actually dealing with this year.
So how will Harvard’s cover letter turn out? I’m glad you asked….
PRINCETON AT HARVARD
For the first time in a long time, the Tigers are contenders again. But Harvard’s not going anywhere. My biggest concern is that Princeton’s defensive advantage over a banged-up offensive line will be too large for the Crimson to overcome, but I think junior quarterback Conner Hempel will give the Crimson just enough in his return from injury.
PICK: HARVARD 41, PRINCETON 37
BROWN AT CORNELL
In a battle of the Crimson’s leftovers, the Bears and Big Red are both fighting for their first league win. In the end, Cornell quarterback Jeff Mathews won’t get enough support in his final chance to beat Brown as his squad continues to struggle in the red zone.
PICK: BROWN 35, CORNELL 27
YALE AT PENNSYLVANIA
Are the Bulldogs finally back? They beat Cornell in September and led Dartmouth two weeks ago before losing a fourth-quarter lead. A second straight victory over Penn would be quite a statement for a team that was 1-6 in the league last year. It’s a nice thought, but the Quakers won’t let it happen.
PICK: PENN 30, YALE 16
COLUMBIA AT DARTMOUTH
If the Ivy League had a player draft each offseason with the worst team picking first, this game might have some meaning. Unfortunately for the Lions, such a system isn’t in place. Columbia gave up three times as many points as it scored last week in a 21-7 loss to Penn. It was still the closest game the Lions have played as they’ve been outscored 187-45 through five weeks.
PICK: DARTMOUTH 31, COLUMBIA 10

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After this weekend, the top of the Ivy League standings will be a little less crowded.
This Saturday at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson (5-0, 2-0 Ivy) will host Princeton (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) in a battle of Ancient Eight unbeatens.
Harvard will attempt to extend its home winning streak to sixteen games, which would be the third-best active streak in Division I. An Ivy League opponent has not left Cambridge victorious since 2009, but the Crimson will likely have its hands full against the Tigers.
“This is as good a team as we’ll play all year,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “And it’s by far the best Princeton team that I’ve seen since the early 1990’s.”
This is the second consecutive year that the Crimson will enter its midyear clash with the Tigers undefeated, but last year’s result at Princeton Stadium is one that the players are looking to put behind them.
Harvard appeared to be well on its way to a 6-0 record after leading 34-10 with less than 12 minutes to play. Yet, Princeton put together an unforgettable comeback, capped by a game-winning 36-yard touchdown pass from Quinn Epperly to Roman Wilson with just 13 seconds remaining. The touchdown represented the last of 29 unanswered Tigers points, which gave the home team an improbable 39-34 victory.
“Last year is last year,” Crimson captain Joshua Boyd said. “This is a completely new team. This is the 2013 edition of the Harvard Crimson football team. Obviously, there are some lessons to take out of last year’s game [though], most importantly the finish. Finish every play. Finish the game.”
This year, finishing games has not been a problem for the Crimson. In Week Three, Harvard came back to tie Holy Cross with 23 seconds remaining on a touchdown pass from junior quarterback Conner Hempel to senior tight end Cameron Brate. The Crimson went on to win that game in triple overtime, 41-35. Then in Week Four, locked in a tight match with Cornell, Harvard sealed a 34-24 win with another touchdown pass in the final minutes to Brate, this one from senior quarterback Michael Pruneau.
Pruneau was thrust into the starting quarterback job after Hempel went down with a hyperextended knee against Holy Cross. Despite struggling in relief in his first contest, Pruneau has led the team to wins in the last two games over Cornell and Lafayette, throwing for 603 yards and five touchdowns.
“[Mike’s] a great player,” sophomore running back Paul Stanton said. “He was able to step in [and] do a great job. We know Conner is a great player as well. I’m confident in all my teammates. It really doesn’t matter who’s out there.”
After taking first-team reps in practice this week, Hempel is expected to get the start against Princeton. Before being sidelined by injury, the junior had thrown for 803 yards and seven touchdowns in three games. The team has scored over 40 points in each of the games that Hempel has started.
The Tigers have also utilized two quarterbacks this season, but not because of injuries. The tandem of Epperly and fellow junior Connor Michelsen has been very effective for Princeton. Epperly has done most of the scoring, accounting for 20 touchdowns this year (nine passing, 11 rushing), while Michelsen has been responsible for driving the team down the field. He is 66-for-111 for 663 yards on the season.
In addition to their unique quarterback duo, the Tigers also feature the best rushing offense in the Ivy League, averaging nearly 250 yards per game. Meanwhile, the Harvard defense has proven to be the best at stopping the run, surrendering only 80 yards per game. Something will have to give on Saturday.
“They’re a run-oriented team,” Boyd said. “So as a defense, we embrace that and accept that challenge. Stopping the run is our number one priority as a defense.”
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson will have its work cut out for it as it tries to score on the best defense in the Ivy League.
“[Princeton] dominate[s] all the offensive categories and all the defensive categories, so this is a team that on paper has very few, if any, weaknesses,” Murphy said.
Harvard will be looking for a big game from Stanton, who had the best game of his career last week in the team’s 35-16 victory over Lafayette, rushing for 113 yards and two touchdowns. The sophomore feels good about his team’s chances.
“We have a lot of energy going this week,” Stanton said. “We’ve had a great week of practice, and we feel like we’re going to be at our best this week.”

Junior Marissa Gedman’s 2012-2013 season ended facedown on a track during an early morning workout in mid-September.
The defenseman had spent the summer pushing herself to the brink, attempting to take her game to the next level. A potential Olympic tryout lay on the horizon, not to mention her third season with the Harvard women’s hockey team.
“I was training really, really hard, trying to get into the best shape of my life,” Gedman said. “It was all or nothing.”
On Sep. 14, after stretching herself for months, Gedman snapped. Literally.
Running a 10-20-30 shuttle drill, she fell in a heap. At first, she just thought her shoe had fallen off. She tried to get up and finish the drill. But then she fell again. Her Achilles tendon had ruptured and rolled up her calf.
“A lot of people describe it as a gunshot,” Gedman said. “It’s a weird injury.”
Within a week, surgery kicked off Gedman’s yearlong rehabilitation program. She withdrew from school to preserve her eligibility before heading home to Framingham, Mass., where she was bedridden for weeks.
But Gedman came back to Cambridge often. As she walked to Bright Hockey Arena on Oct. 20, 2012, she thought she was excited to watch her team begin its season. She sat in the stands where her family always positioned itself, directly across from the home bench, so she could see all of the players.
Then Gedman started to cry. She could not stop.
“I started bawling and I was like, ‘Wow I didn’t expect this,’” Gedman said. “I thought I was ready, but I guess I wasn’t.”
She continued going to all of the Crimson’s games, but watching from the stands never stopped feeling weird.
“I’m getting the chills thinking about it now,” Gedman said. “I never liked it and I never want to do it again.”
But Gedman was not alone on the sidelines. She was able to lean on teammate Josephine Pucci, who missed 2012-2013 with a head injury, during the rehab process.
“I don’t know if I could have done it without her,” Gedman said. “I owe a lot to her just for getting me up in the mornings.”
Gedman added that she never had to search very far for motivation. She was hungry to return to the Crimson stronger than before, and also still had her eyes set on a potential Olympic tryout.
By January, she was skating again—ahead of her rehab schedule.
In the spring, she went to a tattoo parlor to immortalize the ordeal. Next to the scar on her heel, “Persevere” was etched alongside an arrow.
“An arrow can only be launched forward if it’s pulled backward,” Gedman explained. “It’s like a metaphor for turning a setback into a comeback.”
Without Gedman and Pucci, Harvard finished second in the ECAC Tournament and lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament. At the team’s end-of-year banquet, Gedman was named as one of three captains for 2013-2014.
Despite Gedman’s recovery efforts, she did not get an invite to the Olympic tryout. Instead, she returned to Harvard as its only remaining captain. Co-captain Josephine Pucci made the Olympic roster, along with senior Lyndsey Fry and junior Michelle Picard, while the other co-captain, Kalley Armstrong, will miss this season with an injury.
That leaves Gedman to lead a young team that includes just two seniors. Her blueline is even less experienced outside of preseason All-Ivy junior Sarah Edney. Thus far, Gedman has spent much of her time working with a freshman partner at the other defenseman position.
Though she is only a junior, the co-captain explained that the adversity she has faced over the last year has helped her grow more experienced.
“Perspective is expensive,” Gedman said. “Yeah, the year sucked, but being back here now I just see everything so differently…. It was a blessing in disguise.”
Interim coach Maura Crowell has seen a change in Gedman, as well.
“It stinks to go through it,” Crowell said. “But I think the things that she has learned and taken from it have been pretty powerful.”
On Friday, Gedman will return to the ice in a varsity game for the first time since the spring of 2012.
“I’ve been looking forward to this day for so long,” Gedman said.
She is excited to stand on the other side of the Plexiglas boards, looking up at her mom in the stands rather than her would-be teammates on the ice.
She’s ready to be a Harvard hockey player again.

For most teams, the coach is a rock, supporting it in wins or losses and teaching it how to succeed.
And for the past 19 seasons of Harvard women’s ice hockey it has been not a rock, but a stone, that has led it to success—head coach Katey Stone.
But for the first time since the 1993-94 season, the Crimson will have a new leader. As Stone leads the women of Team USA to the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, this February, assistant Maura Crowell has stepped in as interim head coach for the 2013-2014 season.
Crowell will have big shoes to fill, as Stone is the winningest coach in the history of Division I women’s hockey, spending her entire collegiate coaching career thus far with the Crimson.
Harvard is in good hands, though, as Crowell brings over ten years of coaching success to the job.
Since joining the Crimson three seasons ago, Crowell has helped lead the team to an Ivy League title in 2012-2013, two trips to the ECAC tournament semifinals, and a top-10 national ranking.
Although she may not have the experience of Stone, Crowell is certainly no newcomer to college hockey. Prior to coaching at Harvard, she was the head coach of the UMass-Boston women’s hockey team, becoming the winningest coach in the school’s history.
Crowell has also been an assistant coach at Connecticut College and St. Mark’s School in Southborough, Mass.
Aside from coaching at the collegiate level, she has also been involved in Massachusetts Hockey, the Texas Amateur Hockey Association, USA Hockey’s Rocky Mountain and New England Districts, and National Development Camps as a player evaluator.
As a player herself, Crowell played for Colgate University as a forward, helping the team to three straight ECAC playoff appearances and a championship berth.
Despite the change in staffing, the Crimson has much of the same look and feel of past teams. When asked how the two coaches differed, junior co-captain Marissa Gedman struggled to find a drastic change.
“I can’t pinpoint a difference,” Gedman said. “The practices feel the same…. It has been seamless.”
Stone has noted the similarities as well, which has made her much more comfortable with leaving the team in Crowell’s hands this year.
“Maura’s attention to detail and hard-nosed approach to a game are similar; it’s one of the reasons I think we get along so well,” Stone said. “She believes in the details of the game and that the little things matter.”
Crowell has learned a lot from Stone as the two have shared the bench for the past three years, and she plans on using what she has learned to further Harvard’s hockey success.
“There certainly are changes because I’m a different person than she is,” Crowell said. “[But] for the most part we are trying to keep the overall themes the same.”
Despite the fact that the team is used to having Stone at the helm, the players are all very familiar with Crowell. Stone found out she would be coaching the Olympic team in June 2012 and Crowell was announced as the interim coach shortly after that, so the transition has been smooth as the pair have been able to work together in preparation for the upcoming season.
“Everybody in the locker room knew this was coming so it wasn’t a huge shock when I showed up in September,” Crowell said. “There was a lot of familiarity with my personality and my style.”
Preparation was something Crowell cited as a key to Stone’s success, both in her preparation for games and the way she prepares her players to anticipate any possible game situation.
“Coach Stone prepares her teams so well for all situations. It seems like the players are never surprised about what happens in the game,” Crowell added. “They have a quiet confidence about them. That’s what I want to continue because that’s how she’s been able to be so successful.”
In terms of advice for the new coach, Stone didn’t need to give much, as she knew Crowell was the best person for the job.
“I told her to go with her instincts,” Stone said. “She’s got great instincts, and she needs to do what she thinks this group of kids needs this year. I completely trust her and back all of her decisions.”
When the team found out Stone would be departing for the year, each of the other assistant coaches shifted up to a higher level. Laura Bellamy ’13, the former starting goaltender and last year’s co-captain, joins the staff as an assistant coach, alongside Hayley Moore, who is in her second year as assistant coach.
In her first game as interim head coach, Crowell led the Crimson to a 5-2 victory over McGill in the season’s exhibition opener. She cited her past experiences as a head coach as making the shift easier for her, but it has been an adjustment coming back into head coaching after being an assistant for several years.
“Knowing that [Stone] supports me in this position gives me a ton of confidence in doing it,” Crowell said. “I have been a head coach before…. [Harvard] is obviously on a much greater scale and at a higher level so that makes a difference.”
Although Stone will be back next year, Crowell is excited to have the opportunity to lead this team, even if it is only for one season.
“It’s fun for me because I know it is a one year opportunity and Coach Stone is coming back,” Crowell said. ”It’s not like the pressure [of] trying to get a job. It’s fun, I feel very lucky…. To be able to coach the Harvard team is pretty unbelievable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, the stage was set for freshman goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer to thrive, with mentors in senior goaltender Laura Bellamy ’13 and legendary coach Katey Stone.
This season, Maschmeyer will have to do without the winningest coach in Division I history and one of the most notable goaltenders ever to don Crimson.
Bellamy achieved history, finishing second in program history with 19 career shutouts, but was in part overshadowed by Maschmeyer, who took the reins at the end of the season and led the Crimson to its first NCAA tournament in four years.
“Maschmeyer is a really incredible player,” sophomore forward Miye D’Oench said. “She is so incredibly focused.”
Today, her mentor is behind the bench as an assistant coach watching the goaltender who exceeded the high expectations set for her.
“I think she has a really incredible balance of business and fun that makes her a really great player,” D’Oench said. “She is able to lock in and focus on a game without letting all the seriousness throw her off.”
Last season, Maschmeyer and Bellamy started the season more or less alternating in net.
After a successful campaign with the Canadian national team, the incoming freshman got off to a red-hot start, allowing four goals in her first six games.
In her tenth start, the freshman finally lost her first game, 3-1.
The  two-goal margin proved to be the largest Maschmeyer would let her team lose by the entire season. In fact, the Crimson’s netminder lost just three of the 20 games she started by more than a goal and did not let up more than three goals in a single game all season.
After the loss, Maschmeyer bounced right back. From her next game in early February, she got to showcase her skills consistently, starting all but two of the Crimson’s remaining 13 games.
Maschmeyer looked particularly at home in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center where she allowed just eight goals in eight games.
This season will present a whole new set of challenges for the sophomore looking to build on her success.
In addition to losing Bellamy and Stone, Harvard will have to fill the void left by co-captain and national team member Josephine Pucci and fellow seniors Lyndsey Fry and Michelle Piccard, who are also spending this year playing for the U.S. national team.
Around the league some of the key scorers who gave Maschmeyer fits are returning.
Carly Mercer of Clarkson and Jessica Campbell of Cornell, each of whom had multiple-goal games against Maschmeyer last season, will be back and facing the Crimson six days apart in mid-November.
While the incoming freshman class features help in the form of standout goalie Brianna Laing and defender Briana Mastel, the goaltender will be working with a team that returns only 11 upperclassmen.
“We have a very young team,” Maschmeyer said. “It means everyone is going to have to contribute.”
And while all indications point to Maschmeyer being in the driver’s seat for the starting goaltending position, it is still up for grabs.
“It’s a whole new year, so I have to prove where I stand again,” said Maschmeyer, who said she views the competition as an opportunity.
“It’s great that I have competition within the team,” Maschmeyer added. “It pushes us to get better.”
Maschmeyer has grown close with the classmates and teammates she has learned to rely upon.
“It’s really interesting,” D’Oench said. “We are in some ways very spread out but very close.”
While the goaltender may play in net, she is an integral part of the team’s offensive production, allowing the team to take more risks in the offensive zone.
“If you make a mistake you are not going to panic because you have somebody that you really trust behind you,” D’Oench said.
And while the squad is focused on taking the season one game at a time, it is not hard to imagine the goaltender once again coming up big in big games in the not-so-distant future.
Last season, Maschmeyer recorded back-to-back shutouts against Dartmouth to lead the Crimson to the ECAC semifinals.
Whatever the case may be with a year under her belt and the confidence of her team, Maschmeyer seems poised to succeed.
“I am very confident going into the season,” Maschmeyer said. “I know we are going to do great.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For Harvard women’s hockey, the year of the XXII Olympiad is a year of Olympic challenges.
The upcoming games in Sochi, Russia ,mean changes for the whole Crimson squad, as its head coach and several key players take time away from Cambridge to pursue Olympic medals.
Filling in the gaps is no easy job, and the team aspires to maintain its standard of excellence this season in spite of huge adjustments.
Under head coach Katey Stone, the women’s hockey team has been one of the winningest teams at Harvard throughout the past 18 years, collecting six regular season ECAC titles and making nine NCAA tournament appearances.
As Stone takes this year off to coach the USA women’s national team, the Crimson will be led by interim head coach, Maura Crowell, who has been an assistant coach for Harvard for the past three years.
When Crowell, who previously had spent five years at the helm of UMass Boston, found out about her new role in June, she knew that her work was cut out for her.
“Getting back into the role [of head coach] after being assistant coach is an adjustment,” Crowell said. “But it’s a good one.”
Crowell is not facing this adjustment alone. With the support system of assistant coach Hayley Moore, and new assistant coach Laura Bellamy ’13, Crowell is well-equipped to tackle the task at hand.
An additional resource for Crowell in this transitional year is junior captain Marissa Gedman, who is returning to action after suffering an Achilles’ tear last year. Her return marks the comeback of an offensive force for the Crimson, as the lefty defenseman was responsible for eight goals, including five game-winners, in her last season.
“She sets the tone right away,” Crowell said. “She works hard and takes it seriously, so everyone follows in line behind her. Marissa expects a lot out of her teammates, and they want to prove to her that they belong and can meet her standards.”
With only two seniors on this year’s squad, Harvard’s roster is one of the youngest the team has had in years. The Crimson graduated six seniors last season, and is now dominated by younger players, making Gedman’s role as captain all the more crucial to the success of the team. It’s a role she is more than ready to fulfill.
“I love the responsibility,” Gedman said. “I love leading this team.”
Besides the absence of its head coach this year, Harvard is also missing Josephine Pucci, Michelle Picard, and Lindsey Fry, three key players in the Crimson lineup that will all be competing for spots on Olympic rosters this Fall.
The absence of these valuable contributors has made it more necessary than ever for each player on the Crimson to deliver. For this reason, the coaching staff and older players are holding the newcomers to a higher standard than ever as they head into this season.
“We always tell our freshmen, ‘You’re not freshmen anymore after those first few weeks,’” Gedman said. “After that, you’ve got to be on board.”
The Crimson heads into this season ranked No. 9 in the country. Harvard’s ability to adapt to change will be put to the test from its very first game against Quinnipiac, another top-ten squad. From there on out, the competition will only get stiffer, as the Crimson takes on three more preseason top-ten teams in the following weeks.
“Whether people are expecting big things from us or not, we’re expecting big things from ourselves,” Gedman said.
In her stint as head coach, Crowell hopes to emphasize the importance of growth throughout these upcoming matches. Using each playing opportunity as a chance for the entire team to develop as a unit is a primary goal.
“I focus more on expectations than goals,” Crowell said. “I think that the steps along the way are really important in order to get there.”
The players have some goals of their own. After the disappointment of missing out on ECAC and national titles last season, the Crimson is hungry for redemption.
“It has definitely motivated everybody,” junior forward Hillary Crowe said. “And we are going to play with a chip on our shoulder.”
Rebuilding in the face of adversity seems to be the theme of this season for Harvard. From the assistant coach stepping up to take the reigns, to the captain returning stronger than ever after a debilitating injury, to the newcomers stepping up to fill the skates of some of the best players in the nation, the Crimson’s season already seems to be defined by dealing with adversity.
“You can hang your head and think it’s tough, and woe is me,” Crowell said. “But it builds character. We’ve overcome so much already, and we’ll see what else gets thrown our way... I know we can handle it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
About 16 months ago, Jimmy Vesey waited nervously in his seat at Pittsburgh’s Consol Energy Center.
He didn’t want to be there.
The crushing experience of the year before was still too fresh. Then, Vesey had watched from the comfort of his own home as all 30 National Hockey League teams passed on the opportunity to secure the rights to sign him in his first year of eligibility.
This time, he had to experience the anxiety in person at the 50th annual NHL Entry Draft.
As the third round opened, he tensely listened for the invitation to descend the stairs to the draft floor, where his combine roommate and future teammate Brian Hart was already donning a Tampa Bay Lightning jersey and making friends with an NHL legend. The wait was getting unbearable.
And then, just like that, it happened: a voice from a team’s draft desk registered over the PA, and a name flashed on the scoreboard. With the 66th overall pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, the Nashville Predators had selected Jimmy Vesey.
COLLEGE HOCKEY ON THE RISE
Each June, NHL general managers, coaches, and scouts convene to call first dibs on about 210 of the best 18-to-20-year-old players in the world. Unlike their basketball and football counterparts, hockey prospects can enter a professional draft without losing their amateur status.
In 2013-14, 200 drafted players will compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Nine will wear Crimson.
Harvard boasts the sixth-largest contingent of NHL draft picks in college hockey with sophomore forwards Vesey and Hart, freshman forwards Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone, junior forwards Colin Blackwell and Petr Placek, junior defensemen Pat McNally and Max Everson; and junior goaltender Steve Michalek. They will take the ice at a time in which a collegiate route to the pros has never been a more viable option.
When Herb Brooks coached 20 American college students to the Miracle on Ice, college hockey was still considered a fringe path to the NHL. All 42 prospects picked in the first two rounds of the 1980 Entry Draft opted to forego their NCAA eligibility to play in the Canadian major junior leagues.
Times have changed. The rapid growth of youth hockey across the United States has elevated the quality of the NCAA’s go-to talent pool of American-born players. College hockey alums populate the front offices of NHL franchises. The recent MVP-level success of college players like Martin St. Louis, Jonathan Toews, Tim Thomas, and Jonathan Quick hasn’t hurt either.
“If you look back when [Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91] was playing, the number of NHLers who came from college was probably in the ballpark of 15 percent,” said Nate Ewell, Director of Communications for College Hockey, Inc., a non-profit marketing arm of NCAA division I hockey. “If you look at the NHL now, 30 percent of players come from college.”
A record 30.5 percent of players who suited up for NHL teams in the 2011-12 season had college hockey experience. Yet the pull to go pro early remains strong, leaving prospects with important decisions.
BUILD-UP TO THE DRAFT
Now Harvard sophomores, Vesey and Hart look back on their draft day fondly.
“Once I heard my name, it was just a total relief,” Vesey said. “One of the best moments of my life.”
After celebrating with the large family support teams that sat with them, Hart and Vesey made their way to the draft floor to meet with personnel from their new organizations. For Hart, that meant meeting the Hall of Fame center responsible for his selection, Tampa Bay General Manager Steve Yzerman.
“I was a huge fan of him growing up, and it was just an honor to meet him on the floor,” Hart said. “That was one of the coolest experiences I’ve ever had in hockey.”
The days leading up to these happy moments were intense. Two weeks before the draft, Hart and Vesey shared a Toronto hotel room for the annual NHL Combine, a four-day event that includes fitness tests, medical evaluations, and interviews with scouts from each NHL team.
Hart and Vesey had received visits from NHL scouts in the months leading up to the combine, but the stakes were higher in Toronto. There, the American prospects engaged in a rapid-fire series of job interviews with the scouting departments of each interested franchise.
“Some teams are right in your face, with really intense questions,” Hart said. “They try to rattle you a little bit, kind of get in your face and see how you react under pressure.”
Many scouts asked Hart and Vesey about their decision to play for Harvard rather than a Canadian major junior team or another school. For most teams, their NCAA commitments were a non-factor.
“Most guys said that if their kid were going through the same process, they’d want him to do the exact same thing,” Hart recalled.
Others seemed to blanch at drafting a Harvard kid. While a bias against NCAA hockey has generally disappeared from the NHL, a number of scouts still seem to favor less academically-inclined options.
“Some teams told me straight up that they [didn’t] know if they could draft me strictly because I’d go to Harvard,” Vesey said. “Some teams would ask me, ‘So you’re going to Harvard?’ and then, ‘Do you want to be a hockey player or do you want to be a student?’”
But an anti-Crimson bias among some teams may be matched by a pro-Crimson bias among others. In 2009, Harvard alum and Boston Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli ’87 traded with Minnesota Wild GM and former teammate Chuck Fletcher ’90 for the rights to sign Alex Fallstrom ’13. Nine different NHL teams hold the rights to the nine draft picks who currently play for Harvard.
NHL teams also met with Vesey and Hart during draft weekend, hours before their selections. By the time Hart took his seat for the the second round, he could only guess where he would land.
“At the combine I had no idea who had the most interest. It was back-to-back-to-back, 15-minute interviews,” Hart said. “In general, I really had no idea until draft day who I was going to be drafted by.”
THE ALLURE OF MAJOR JUNIORS
Historically, Canadian major junior hockey has represented the quickest and most popular pipeline for young NHL talent.
Players between the ages of 16 and 20 are eligible to play in the Canadian Hockey League, a 60-team umbrella organization of three sub-leagues that play in Canada and the northern United States. Since some CHL players may sign contracts with NHL teams, all CHL players must forfeit their NCAA eligibility.
The CHL more closely mirrors the NHL than the NCAA does with respect to schedule length and specific rules. The CHL’s talent pool is also arguably deeper than the NCAA’s, and CHL teams compete for the prestigious Memorial Cup in May.
The pressure to play in the CHL is relatively low for New England-born players like Hart and Vesey, whose fathers both played college hockey. But in Canada and areas of the United States that have weaker traditions of college hockey, the CHL’s pull is considerably stronger.  Hailing from Toronto, Harvard freshman and New Jersey Devils draft pick Alexander Kerfoot faced a real decision.
“For people who go to major juniors, it’s a pretty enticing offer,” Kerfoot said. “It’s basically a semi-professional league. So people will get drawn in and go there, but I just think that college hockey has really improved in the last couple of years.”
For Kerfoot, the opportunity to play hockey while getting an education was too good to pass up. He also feels that Harvard’s shorter schedule will allow him more time to develop in the weight room and hone his skills. In its first four years of existence, College Hockey, Inc., has heavily promoted these and other advantages of college hockey.
“Our message is really, ‘Unless you’re going to be a surefire NHLer at 19, or if you have so little interest in academics that you wouldn’t succeed in a college environment, then college is something you should definitely consider,’” Ewell said.
Only about 15 teenagers may have the chance to play in the NHL each year.
College Hockey, Inc., moderates showcases across Canada in which American college coaches explain the rules of the recruiting process and what it means to play in the NCAA. Ryan Kennedy, a senior columnist for The Hockey News, applauds the organization’s efforts.
“I think [College Hockey, Inc., is] doing a great job,” Kennedy said. “They are a good intermediary [and] source of information for kids that are trying to make this pretty big decision in their lives… It’s a matter of knowing what the rules are, and I think College Hockey Inc. has done a very good job of explaining that.”
North American players need not forego junior hockey entirely to maintain NCAA eligibility. College prospects may play in less-competitive American junior leagues like the United States Hockey League for one or two years before they enroll in a university. In the year leading up to his Harvard debut, Vesey set single-season Eastern Junior Hockey League records for points and goals with the South Shore Kings.
PLAYER DEVELOPMENT IN THE NCAA
Although drafted NCAA players may not sign contracts with professional teams, they remain in close contact with their organizations throughout their college years. Scouts travel to select Harvard games to meet with their team’s draft pick and watch him play. NHL front offices offer advice, analyze game film, and receive progress reports from Donato.
“If they’re coming in for the weekend, they’ll usually email me or call me about when they’re coming in,” Vesey said of the Predators employees who track his progress. “It’s a little bit more pressure, but I try to ignore it and just go out there and play like any other game.”
An NHL team also communicates with an NCAA prospect about when he might be ready to take the next step in his career. Often, this next step happens before a player has completed his degree.
“I think if a guy is certainly ready to play in the NHL, then that’s something that we encourage,” Ewell said. “We are proud [of] how our college teams can develop players and get them ready to step into the NHL. Where we have concern is when players leave too early and aren’t quite prepared for that level of competition and leave themselves with a lot of work to do to get their degree.”
For some players, the decision to leave a college team early pays dividends. Toews left the University of North Dakota after his sophomore year in 2007 to sign with the Chicago Blackhawks and was named the MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs three years later. For other players, it can represent a questionable gamble.
In the 2009-10 NCAA season, Harvard freshman and first-round draft pick Louis Leblanc took home Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors with 23 points in 31 games. By the next season, Leblanc had signed a three-year deal with the Montreal Canadiens.
Leblanc played one successful season in the CHL before appearing in 42 games for the Canadiens in 2011-12. Since then, however, the Quebec native has been relegated to minor league play. Leblanc was among the Canadiens’ first group of cuts for the 2013-14 season.
Ewell noted that most college players who decide to go pro early usually have less academic ground to make up than Leblanc.
“In most cases we’ve found, especially recently, players have been staying three years at a minimum, and that gives them a great shot at finishing their degree in the summer or even online in some cases,” Ewell said.
Of the 271 former NCAA players who appeared in the 2012-13 NHL season, 71 percent spent three or more years in college. Fourty four percent stayed a full four years. The Crimson’s most recent Ivy League Rookie of the Year will be sticking around at least one more season.
“My personal opinion is that a college player should only leave before graduating if he has dominated the league so much that it wouldn’t benefit him any more to stay in college hockey,” Vesey said. “Nashville has told me that they don’t care if I stay all four years, because with some teams that might be an issue.”
Louis Leblanc’s former classmate, Alex Killorn ’12, played through all four years of his eligibility before signing a contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. Killorn had a breakout rookie season last year and seems to have secured a solid spot on Tampa Bay’s depth chart.
“Killorn’s a great story,” Kennedy said. “There’s a player who really benefitted from playing in the NCAA, where he took that development time and turned himself into a prospect.”
Ultimately, the NHL offers only about 700 jobs, most of which won’t be opening up any time soon. Most of the 211 players selected in Hart and Vesey’s draft will not see any NHL playing time, and even fewer will enjoy lengthy careers at the highest level of hockey.
But as the sport continues to grow in the United States and schools like Harvard increase their yields of elite talent, the future promises more college hockey success stories.
“Right now I’m just taking it year by year,” Vesey said. “I had a pretty solid freshman year, and I’m trying to build off that and see where it takes me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You could say that the sophomores of the Harvard men’s ice hockey team have something to prove this season.
After coming into their rookie year as the top-ranked recruiting class in the ECAC, the Class of 2016 experienced some growing pains as the Crimson faded down the stretch in 2012-13 to finish last in the league for the first time in school history.
While then-freshmen Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo played crucial roles in the team’s stunning upset of top-ranked Quinnipiac in March—with Criscuolo scoring the tying goal to send the game to overtime and Vesey assisting on senior Alex Fallstrom ‘13’s game-winner with 18.6 seconds left in the overtime period—it wasn’t enough to salvage a season marked by more lows than highs.
“It wasn’t a great experience on a lot of levels,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ‘91 said. “I do think the silver lining is that a lot of [the freshmen] got to play really important minutes and had some big roles, and that’ll hopefully reap some benefits this year.”
Despite the disappointments from the 2012-2013 campaign, the current sophomore class—led by forwards Brian Hart, Vesey, and Criscuolo—showed signs of a brighter future for the program.
Vesey in particular rose to the occasion on offense, scoring 11 goals and notching eight assists on his way to earning Ivy League Rookie of the Year honors and a spot on the ECAC All-Rookie team. The forward also shined on the world stage, joining the US Junior National Team over the winter break to win a U20 World Championship title in Ufa, Russia.
“Jimmy Vesey, for the better part of the first half of last season, was our best offensive player,” Donato said. “With injuries, going to the Worlds Juniors and all that travel, he kind of wore down a little bit, but we expect him to be a very important part of our team.”
Criscuolo and Hart also played critical roles for the Harvard offense, as Criscuolo tallied six goals and seven assists and Hart added five goals and 13 assists. After a disappointing rookie campaign in which the Crimson ended its season in the first round of the ECAC tournament, the sophomores are hopeful that this season will go differently.
“I think all the guys are excited for a fresh start after last year,” Criscuolo said. “We kind of had a crappy feeling after last season, and we didn’t really have a great vibe in the middle of the year, either. I’m excited with the squad that we have; I think we’re really tight.”
The talented group faces high expectations this season now that they have a year of experience in collegiate hockey under their belts. Donato will look to his sophomore class, which also found key contributors in forward Greg Gozzo and defender Desmond Bergin last season, to make an even larger impact on the ice.
“Usually we see that the biggest development and the biggest improvement over a four-year window is between the freshman and sophomore year,” Donato said. “We’re excited to see how these guys will do when the lights get turned on, so to speak, but it should be a very competitive lineup.”
The current group of upperclassmen will be outnumbered this year by the freshmen, who make up another top-ranked recruiting class highlighted by NHL draft picks Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone. A look at the 2013-2014 Harvard men’s hockey roster shows that it is dominated by underclassmen as nine freshmen join eight sophomores to create a noticeably younger roster.
“All the young guys have a lot of energy, and it’s going to make the old guys work harder having young guys pushing them the whole time,” Criscuolo said. “It might take a little time to adjust to the ECAC style for our freshmen, but I think over time it will be a positive for us.”
After a year playing in the highly-competitive ECAC—which saw Yale and Quinnipiac compete with one another for the national title—the sophomores will be looked at over the course of the season to provide guidance to their counterparts in the year below. This year, the Crimson will face five teams ranked in the preseason top-15, including fourth-ranked Boston College on November 20.
“The biggest thing for us as sophomores this year is to take more of a leadership role,” Vesey said. “A lot of our lineup is going to be freshmen and sophomores, so I think they look up to us a little bit and it’s our job to lead by example and show them the ropes.”
While this year will see the return to the team of juniors Patrick McNally, Steve Michalek, and Max Everson, having the sophomores take on such leadership responsibility will be crucial for a Harvard team that hopes for its freshmen to make an immediate impact on the ice. After all, it never hurts to be able to lead by example, and last year’s rookies are no strangers to high expectations.
“Hopefully a lot of our freshmen will be able to step in right away,” Criscuolo said. “Our class was able to do that a little bit last year. The majority of guys will be freshmen and sophomores, so I think we’re going to have a lot of pressure on us early to produce.”
With the loss of All-American captain Danny Biega ‘13 on defense and perpetual scoring threat Marshall Everson ‘13 on offense, Harvard will be looking to its sophomores to capitalize on the gains made last season and bring the Crimson, which is currently ranked 6th and 10th in the ECAC preseason coaches’ and media polls, respectively, out of the bottom half of the conference standings.
“On any given night last year you could come to see a game and see Jimmy Vesey be our best player, or other nights see Kyle Criscuolo be our best player,” Donato said. “Brian Hart also had moments where he was very good. That group really is the core of what we’re trying to do and where we’re headed as a program, and I think those three guys in particular have a chance to make a large impact this year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Juniors Max Everson and Patrick McNally jumped off to strong starts last season for the Harvard men’s hockey team. Through seven games, the sophomore defenders registered a positive plus-minus rating and combined for four points.
But their success would be cut short. The duo left the team after the seventh game of the season, and the Crimson’s defense immediately felt the impact of its absence.
After allowing fewer than two goals per game with McNally and Everson in the line-up, Harvard finished the season with a conference-worst 3.01 goals against average.
This year, Everson and McNally will return to the team looking to strengthen the squad’s performance in the defensive zone.
“I’m hungry coming back. I feel like I prepared more than I normally would [for a season],” McNally said. “[Everson and I] are looking to make a difference.”
The Crimson’s challenge to improve its defensive efforts this year will start with finding a replacement for former captain Danny Biega ’13. The 2012 All-American graduated in the spring and is now with the Charlotte Checkers, the top minor league team for the NHL’s Carolina Hurricanes. Biega’s best season came in his junior year, when he tallied 35 points and 10 goals to earn the nod for ECAC Defenseman of the Year.
“Danny Biega was a huge part of our team last year both offensively and defensively,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Coming into the season last year, he was an incredibly important part of what we were trying to do.”
Despite their limited opportunity to play with Biega, McNally and Everson were able to observe what the Montreal native did well during practices and games. The two roommates hope that they can take what they have learned from Biega’s game and apply it to their own.
“As a player, it’s always great to be able to play with a kid who has as much skill [as Biega],” Everson said. “When you played with him, it made you look really good.”
Biega excelled on the power play, leading the point on Division I hockey’s most effective man-up offense during his junior year. He also led all players with 14 power play points that year, registering two goals and 12 assists. McNally and his fellow defensemen hope to emulate Biega’s success in that department.
“[Biega] was really helpful with me on the power play,” McNally said. “He taught me how to do it at the college level, which is a lot different than high school. There’s a lot less time out there [to make decisions].”
For Harvard, Biega was not only an impressive talent on the ice, but also an influential leader.
“He was our hardest working guy these past two years,” Everson said. “His determination on the ice rubbed off on…all of our defensemen and players in general.”
In addition to the leadership of senior captain and fellow defender Dan Ford, Donato will turn to the complementary playing styles of McNally and Everson to help fill Biega’s skates.
“Max is an excellent defenseman, not necessarily in ways that are quantifiable,” Donato said. “He’s a defensive defenseman. He’s an excellent penalty killer and plays against the other teams’ top players.”
McNally, on the other hand, will help offset the offensive potential lost with Biega’s graduation.
“Patrick McNally is as gifted an offensive player on the blue line as we’ve had,” Donato said. “He’s a guy I think that could really step up.”
The tandem is not only compatible within the rink, but outside of it, as well, living together as roommates. Having rarely played with each other in game situations thus far, the duo hopes that its chemistry translates to the ice.
“It’s been pretty fun playing with him,” said Everson of practicing with McNally. “I’ve wanted to since [I got] here. We’re able to read off each other really well and hopefully we get a chance to play together [in games] this year.”
Everson feels confident in the Crimson’s new defensive rotation.
“I wouldn’t set a limit on [our success this year],” Everson said. “I’m excited to get going.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a season of personnel struggles and unmet expectations, the 2013-14 Harvard men’s hockey team will skate a younger and larger line-up against college hockey’s hottest conference.
It will not take much for the Crimson to improve upon its performance last season, which concluded with Yale defeating ECAC regular season champion Quinnipiac in the the national final. Harvard finished last in the regular season standings for the first time in ECAC history before falling to Dartmouth in three games in the first round of the conference postseason.
“We’re coming out of the cellar,” sophomore forward Brian Hart said. “There’s only one place to go and that’s up.”
The 2012-13 campaign included winless stretches of six and nine games through the middle of the regular season. For a time, Harvard’s power play ranked last among all Division I schools. The Crimson suffered from the early departures of then-sophomore blueliners Patrick McNally and Max Everson and a slew of injuries to an already-strained roster.
“I think last season was a difficult one; it was frustrating,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “I think we started out with one team and kind of ended with another.”
But the season was not without positive moments, including the Crimson’s first win over a No. 1-ranked opponent since 2004 with a late-season overtime victory over Quinnipiac at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center. Among Harvard’s other wins were a 6-5 overtime comeback at then-No.6 Boston University and a 4-1 win at then-No. 10 Cornell.
This year, Harvard will look to build off those same successes on a more consistent basis with a younger cast of players. Sophomore forwards Jimmy Vesey, Brian Hart and Kyle Criscuolo picked up important points for the Crimson during their rookie campaigns despite various injuries. Top freshmen recruits Alexander Kerfoot and Sean Malone will also help to fill the offensive void left by graduated seniors Alex Fallstrom, Marshall Everson, and Luke Greiner.
“We have a little bit more talent this year in terms of skill and offensive ability, so I think we’re going to play a different style,” Vesey said. “We’re going to score a lot more goals, and everyone’s going to contribute.”
From a forward corps that does not include a single senior, Harvard will also look toward freshmen forwards Luke Esposito and Phil Zielonka to make an immediate impact, along with junior Tommy O’Regan. One lingering question on offense is the health of junior Colin Blackwell, who missed the last six games of 2012-13.
Captain Dan Ford will lead a more experienced Harvard blueline into the 2013-14 campaign. The return of McNally and Everson is welcome news to a defensive rotation that carried only five healthy defensemen from its original roster at one point last year. With ten defensemen listed on the Crimson’s roster this year, it is unlikely that Donato will have to call up a defender from Harvard’s club team as he did last season.
For the first time in recent memory, Donato will have three goaltenders with significant collegiate playing time to call on. The return of junior Steve Michalek, who left Harvard before the start of the 2012-13 campaign, provides an extra option in the crease for the Crimson, which relied on second-year starter Raphael Girard and rookie backup Peter Traber last season. Donato has not yet committed to a single starter or a rotation system for 2013-14.
“It’ll be a competitive spot. I think [goaltending] has a chance to be a very solid position for us, a position of depth and also a position of strength,” Donato said. “There’ll be opportunity early on and we’ll see who kind of takes the ball and runs with it.”
The Crimson’s roster features nine NHL draft picks, the sixth-most in the NCAA and more than any other ECAC squad. Harvard enters this season with lower expectations than it did last year, but its raw talent has nevertheless drawn the attention of pollsters. With college hockey already underway for most non-Ivy schools, a 0-0-0 Crimson squad has still received multiple votes in the latest USCHO.com top-20 national rankings.
Donato has learned to take preseason forecasts with a grain of salt.
“We’ve lost the popularity polls and had some good teams and we’ve started off in the popularity polls pretty well and not done so well,” Donato said. “I’m not interested in being
in the top 20 at the beginning of the year. I think at the end of the season, we want to be a team that’s playing its best and has a chance to advance.”
Harvard has been tabbed to finish in the middle-of-the-pack in the ECAC coaches’ preseason poll and tenth in the writers’ poll. A record six different teams received first-place votes in the coaches’ poll, with Yale taking the top spot.
The media poll also reflected the conference’s parity, with five teams receiving first-place votes.
The Crimson will jump into conference play against media-favorite RPI in a home-and-home series Oct. 29 and Nov. 1. Regular season highlights will include a nationally televised game versus Yale at Madison Square Garden Jan. 11 and the 62nd Beanpot Tournament Feb. 3 and 11.
The team that will take the ice at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center this Saturday versus Bentley will look considerably different than the one that left Dartmouth’s Thompson Arena on the heels of a 6-3 elimination-game loss at the end of last season. Donato feels that Harvard has taken extra motivation from last season’s frustrations.
“After last year our team certainly has a little bit of a chip on their shoulder, and we have a lot to prove,” Donato said. “We’re excited to go forward and prove that we can be a good team.”

'Tis the season for new Apple releases, and with Apple announcing that the latest version of their operating system will for the first time be a free release, it’s almost like Christmas came early. But beyond the irresistible price and cat-free name, what’s new? Here are some highlights.
When you hear a name like “OS X Mavericks”, it’s reasonable to expect some big changes. However, Mavericks is nowhere near as visually arresting as the new iOS7 is. In fact, this update looks pretty much the same as Mountain Lion, the last OS X release. The only cosmetic change is that the menu bar that runs across the top of the screen has gone from translucent to chrome, as if to prove that something has changed. Of course, as the saying goes, if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.
 
Among those changes that aren’t immediately noticeable are your Mac’s ability to let you tag your files; perfect for those times when you can’t remember what title you gave your paper at 4 a.m. Finder also gets a tabs feature in this update, great for keeping multiple folders open without cluttering up your precious screen space as you cram for finals.
 
iBooks and Maps are the only truly brand new additions. iBooks brings the mobile app to your desktop, letting you keep reading and highlighting, and iMaps has some cool features like the inclusion of Yelp reviews. However, there’s still something more trustworthy about Google Maps, which remains our go-to on late Saturday nights. Meanwhile, iCal gains some new features, like giving you travel time and weather for any event you have entered a location for—perfect for the New England weather famed for its unpredictability. Safari also gets an update with a sidebar that lets you view your bookmarks and reading list at the same time as you view the site you’re currently on.
 
The most important aspect of Mavericks is its acknowledgment of the need to conserve battery power. App Nap detects when windows hidden behind other windows are inactive and puts them into nap-mode. This could make the difference if your battery bar’s red but you have one more lecture to get through. Mavericks also uses Compressed Memory, which automatically compresses inactive apps, saving space for all those notes.
 
In the final analysis, it’s great that this is a free update, since only a few of the features are truly indispensable. It’s nice to see Apple acknowledging that—like good students—their computers need to work smarter, not just harder.

Whether it is used to wake you up in the morning, remind you to do your laundry before lunch, or fill that awkward silence a few minutes before class starts, your smartphone is a necessity. However, you may have been frustrated by the appalling scarcity of apps specificly designed for Harvard struggles. Here is a list of apps that should, but don’t exist (yet). CS50 kids, pay attention: 
1. The “Track Mankiw” AppEach time Mankiw is detected in public view, the all-important question is raised once again: clearly too busy to be actually teaching, what exactly does Mankiw do? This app will allow users to report a Mankiw sighting, detailing the precise time and location of the incident.
2. The “HUDS” AppThis revolutionary app will include detailed breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND brain-break offerings. (Disclaimer: I know that “Dining Halls” are a feature on the Harvard app already. But it’s the Harvard app. I get hungrier faster than that app loads.)
3. The “Free Market” AppThis app will provide information on which booths will be providing free samples at the Farmer’s Market, because we all know that’s the only reason you walk through them every Tuesday and Friday.
4. The “Where’s My Key” AppSelf-explanatory.
5. The “HarvSquare” AppThis app will be a spinoff of FourSquare to incentivize real living. You know, like how a real person lives. You not only get points when you arrive at social areas (e.g. Pinkberry), but also when you leave from work places (e.g. Science Center). Bonus points for leaving Lamont before midnight on weekdays.
6. The “Traffic Control” AppThis app will highlight routes that are congested by large groups of tourists—perfect if you want to avoid traffic and actually get to class on time.
7. The “Study Break Calendar” AppThis app will send alerts before every sponsored Study Break that is open to all students, regardless of housing. You will never miss another ramen study break again.

It’s the weekend before Halloween—and really the first weekend that feels like fall—so go out, drink some hot cider, and appreciate the fall colors, whether you’re in a costume or not.
 
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
 
Expect temperatures in the 50s and a mix of clouds and sun for one of the first truly chilly weekends of the semester. It may be getting colder, but at least snow won’t be on the radar for a while (we hope).

Want to look good this Halloween but just realized you gained too much weight to go as a sexy cat again? Or maybe you just found out that the Garment District isn’t actually an entire district, and have been too embarrassed to go ever since? Or is it that you realized that the life-sized Furby costume that you’ve been planning isn’t as original as you thought? If you’ve answered yes to one or all of these questions, then you could use a last minute sexy Halloween costume. You could also use a refresher in high school rhetoric. The questions were rhetorical.
1. Sexy Ghost
The trick to making the classic Charlie Brown old sheet get-up sexy is all in the performance. Tell people that under the bedding you are actually super attractive. Wow them with descriptions of how symmetrical your face is and how sensitive a person you are, especially when you are volunteering for the elderly.
2. Sexy Generic Animal
It doesn’t have to be a cat this year! If you want to make things a little more interesting try going as your favorite animal, a raccoon. If your favorite animal is not a raccoon try going as a cockroach. If you are looking for a group costume you can make it an infestation.
3. Sexy Librarian
Buy some prescription glasses and then apply for a job at Widener. It’s sexy because instead of going out Saturday night you can go to work scanning books. Nothing is sexier than making $11.50 an hour, $13 if you are on work-study.
4. Sexy Current Event or Pun
The best costumes are the ones that you have to explain; the very best costumes are the ones that you have to explain twice, preferably with diagrams and some sort of metric equation. Might I recommend dressing up as deviled eggs (all you need are horns and an omelet), or the recent government shutdown (all you need is a mini skirt and cat ears)?
5. Sexy Binge Drinking
When you’re drunk, people won’t remember that you were too lazy to put on a costume; all they will remember is that you puked on their couch. (Not recommended.)

If you’re anything like us, someone would have to pay you a lot of money (Board Plus times a million, really) to go back to middle school. But with Halloween fast approaching, we’ve come to realize that being 12 has one major perk—the right to trick-or-treat without being asked if you’re “too old” to demand free candy from your neighbors.
In honor of the trick-or-treating we hope you do next week, Flyby came up with some ways to connect with your pre-teenage self on Halloween.
1. Pull out that prep-school uniform. Nothing screams 12 more than an ill-fitting skirt and a polo.
2. Pre-game doing your makeup. It will look like the way you did it when you were 12.
3. Pull out that cape and mask so no one notices the stubble on your face. Maybe you can pass as that tall 12-year-old.
4. Wear excessive amounts of vanilla body spray or AXE. There is nothing like the smell of teen spirit.
5. Pull that retainer your mom made you bring to college out of the back corner of your closet. We know you have perfect teeth now after a bunch of hellish years of braces. We also know that pre-teens can’t get enough of those metal works of art.
6. Wear your new “high-heeled” shoes that you would now consider a day-to-day height. At age 12, you thought one inch was high.
7. Stay with a group of friends and talk only in text lingo and lol after, like, every, like, other, like, word. You hate to admit it, but you once did this, too. 
8. Seem as unexcited as possible when you are out trick-or-treating. College kids know it’s a treat, but pre-teens don’t.
9. When you get candy, make sure you don’t get short-changed—comment that “I’m a big kid” when they tell you you can only take one piece. Don’t these people know that, proportional to your size, one piece of “fun-sized” candy is nothing?
10. When the night is over, hang out in Starbucks gossiping over some hot chocolate. Twelve-year-olds aren’t old enough for coffee.
After you have received all of your decisions, you should reflect upon the choices you have and decide a plan of action. It may be that you feel that the school(s) that waitlisted you are not worth pursuing; if that is the case, you should ask to be taken off the waitlist.
On the other hand, if you decide that you do want to pursue the school(s) that waitlisted you, you have a little bit of work ahead of you. The first thing you need to do is notify them of your continued interest. You should also write a brief statement about why you are perfect fit and list any awards, honors, grades, or other compelling factors that you have accrued since you sent off your application. If there are any skills or extracurriculars that you left off of your application, you should include them here.
At the same time, however, it's important to remember that a lot of what will happen is out of your hands. Many colleges use the waitlist to fill gaps in their class—not enough oboists, say, or too few lacrosse players—and if you do not fall into one of the desired categories, then you may be passed over. So while that doesn't mean that getting admitted off the waitlist is impossible, it does mean that you shouldn't count on it. At the same time as you are preparing your waitlist materials, you should also spend time looking into the schools that did admit you and seeing if perhaps one of them wouldn't be the right fit after all.
