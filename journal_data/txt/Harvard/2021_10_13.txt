After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Psych Drama Company’s audio drama adaptation of Shakespeare’s “Macbeth” captivates its audience in — to use the show’s words — “one fell swoop.” In this reimagined version of the tragedy, featuring Harvard alum Lindsay T. McAuliffe ’20 as a witch, director Wendy Lippe immerses listeners in the world of these well-known characters through an aural experience. As an easily accessible yet enchanting experience, this chilling 90-minute adaptation epitomizes the appeal of audio dramas in that it is an easily accessible and low-pressure enchanting experience available to stream online from Sept. 10 until Oct. 22.
“Macbeth” is at heart a story of ambition and paranoia, feelings conveyed immediately by composer Zarko Dragojevic’s original music and soundscape. The background music is suspenseful and violin-heavy when tensions are mounting, and raucous and rich during war and death. As audiences follow the trials and tribulations of Mark Prokes’s Macbeth, a Scottish general who will do anything to be king, the music guides our interpretation of his aspiration and guilt.
Even beyond music, sound is not just the medium through which listeners hear the story but also a key factor in their emotional experience. Macbeth’s paranoia ​​in Act III, for example, translates to irregular sounds that unnerve listeners, as if warning of imminent danger. The aural experience also allows for a riveting dramatization of the witches in the play, two of which are voiced by McAuliffe. The wide range in their voices — one speaks in a higher register, and another in a baby-like voice — magnifies the group’s chaotic nature. Complemented by the echoes often used on their voices and the lively soundscape of the show, these witches, who have been reimagined countless times in the play’s long history, terrify anew in the psych drama production.
The true magic of the show, though, lies in how these sounds spark audiences’ imaginations. When the witches speak to Macbeth in Act I, for example, an echo effect is paired with their overlapped voices, giving listeners the impression of being surrounded by them. Their whispers are persistent, imitating Macbeth’s inner turmoil. This curated acoustic environment gives the audience the context they need to imagine the scenes in whatever way suits them. Still, the plot alone is drama-filled and entertaining, with each character’s distinct voice playing into its progression.
The medium was certainly used well by the cast, who convincingly portrayed their roles without the help of physicality. Wendy Lippe’s Lady Macbeth has a honeyed and demanding voice that conjures a character who cannot be trusted to resist the temptation of power, and who will resort to violence to get it. Brian Dion’s Macduff has a gruff voice that implies his superiority to the doomed Macbeth, portraying him as being both more powerful and virtuous than Mark Prokes’s villain.
Listeners may expect the lack of visuals in “Macbeth” to be a hindrance, but it amplifies the effects of the sound in a way that seeing characters on stage (separate from the audience) cannot. Instead, the drama’s intermission, a virtual art gallery of pieces by Nick Morse, provides a visual experience. Morse’s colorful and emotive art encourages deliberation on the themes about human fallibility conveyed in the show. “Macbeth” puts audience members in the characters’ heads, allowing them to empathize while giving them agency over how to picture the narrative. This aligns with the psychological frame of the Psych Drama Company, which aims to use theatre to explore the human psyche and encourage reflection. This auditory production serves as a reminder that all listeners need to experience a stirring production is a pair of headphones and an imagination.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Walking into Annenberg for the first time transports you. Enveloped by exquisite stained glass and with the eyes of Shakespeare and Dante piercing down at you, the grandeur often associated with Harvard becomes unmistakably palpable. Originally conceived as a way to honor the Harvard graduates who fought for the Union in the Civil War, Annenberg became the freshman dining hall in 1994, serving about 3,400 meals a day as of 2009.
The freshman experience is forged in Annenberg, where students fresh from high school graduation share meals with their peers, forming bonds that span the duration of their time at Harvard. My class, the Class of 2024, missed out on this significant experience, having instead to contend with grab-and-go bagged meals during our first year on campus. Thankfully, Annenberg is now back to normal capacity and function for the Class of 2025 (and all other classes for breakfast only).
Though grabbing a meal at Annenberg is a mundane action in terms of the Harvard experience, the ordinary event of eating in the freshman dining hall is contrasted by the magnificent architecture of the building itself. This juxtaposition is a bit jarring, only adding to the character of Annenberg.
It’s already overwhelming to be a freshman at Harvard; eating in a dining hall frequently compared to Hogwarts only compounds this. As Matthew Nekritz ’25 described in an interview about Annenberg, “It’s the most beautiful place I’ve probably ever eaten. I mean, it’s just crazy how pretty it is.” Nekritz discussed how “you walk in and there’s always so many students in there and there’s just a very, very good energy of meeting people and talking, especially the first week of school.”
Food intrinsically connects us, as eating together is a community-driven activity. Students forge new relationships over meals, sometimes seeking shelter in company or in hot soup during the frigid Boston winter. We bring to the table fond memories of our own family dinners, cultural heritage passed down through hands assembling a dish or stirring a pot.
Because food has vital cultural and religious significance, many students have dietary needs specific to their cultural and religious beliefs. As Harvard is full of students from all corners of the globe with a multitude of backgrounds, it is important that this diversity is also reflected in equitable and easy access to food for students whose religion and culture necessitate adherence to certain diets. Many students belonging to different cultural communities have expressed dismay about the inability to access food that they are actually able to eat at Harvard.
For many students who keep Kosher, like Leah Baron ’25, finding a full meal in Annenberg can be a challenge. Baron explained to me that she has “only eaten in Annenberg for a meal once,” and that the Kosher options that Annenberg provides are “generally a little bit lacking, in the sense that there just really aren’t a lot of them.” Though Baron described breakfast as feasible to eat in Annenberg because there are options such as cereal, fruit, and yogurt, lunch and dinner are more of a challenge. She told me how Annenberg only offers “a couple of frozen meals, like American cheese and sliced deli meats and frozen pizza bagels” for people who keep Kosher — which don’t really constitute a whole, fulfilling meal.
Devangana Rana ’25, who is a vegetarian, also described to me how the options available to her are not fulfilling: “I go for dinner around six, and I get hungry by like nine or eight-thirty.” She continued on to say that “the options for meals are sometimes limited,” and on some days they “just don’t look appealing.” Rana also added that a couple of her friends who eat a Halal diet “sometimes don’t find it very appealing either.”
As Fahim Ahmed ’25, who tries to maintain a Halal diet, told me that “there have been occasions where there’s very limited options there, sometimes there isn’t even any Halal meat options, and I think that makes it kind of difficult to stick to trying to eat Halal.” Ahmed contends however that for the most part, “they’ve been pretty decent about it.”
If food connects us, then difficulty in accessing food has the potential to disconnect us. Moreover, students should get what they pay for — Harvard requires all students to be on the same dining plan, but students who are forced to find meals elsewhere in places not covered by the meal plan are simply not getting their money’s worth.
The foundational experience of eating in Annenberg is bonding with peers over shared food. If students have issues accessing food that they can actually eat, then that chips away at the dining hall’s community-building function here at Harvard. Annenberg and all other dining halls must have fulfilling, adequate meal options for all students — including those with particular dietary needs.
Connecting with others over meals informs not only much of the Harvard experience, but much of the human experience. Everyone deserves to have nutritious and easily accessible food available to them, enabling them to better integrate into the communities they are a part of.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge, Massachusetts: Home to prestigious schools, ambitious Ivy Leaguers, and, as of recently, an alarming number of (non-human) pests. Upon returning to our once abandoned campus, Harvard residents have been welcomed by rats, roaches, and even mushroom infestations in sometimes crumbling dorms, prompting student complaints and a new city-wide anti-rodent policy order.
Pests and holes in the walls are definitely no fun. Reports of suites haunted by half a dozen cockroaches and water-stained rugs that grow fungi are rightfully disquieting. That’s not to say they are not somewhat understandable: It makes sense that campus spaces left largely uninhabited for months would decay or, entrepreneurially, find new tenants. The increased need for basic maintenance and pest control is an inevitable, if regrettable, consequence of our collective absence.
The good news is that not all dorms are equally decrepit: Renovated houses, in particular, appear to have endured the test of time better than unrenovated spaces, remaining, for the most part, freer of unwelcome guests.
This lack of moths and mice inside Winthrop House and the like strongly suggests that updated living spaces might resist the invasion more easily. The disparity in defenses is a cause for concern, condemning the inhabitants of certain Houses to deal with a less animated version of Ratatouille while sparing their peers. It also strengthens the case for a rapid renewal of our living spaces; such renovations were already necessary before the pandemic, but have now taken on a new urgency. In the words of Harvard’s House Renewal Project, re-configuring our inside spaces is crucial to alleviating overcrowding and increasing student privacy. The fact that our peers must now contend with both two-legged and eight-legged roommates only bolsters the case for a speedy remake of our all-too-historic halls.
That is not to say that we expect an overnight remaking of our campus, or even an overnight banishing of the tiny critters that so afflict us. Even at a $40 billion institution where capital isn’t exactly a constraining factor, renovations can only move so fast. We are satisfied with the housing makeovers completed by Harvard thus far, and look forward to the eventual development of usable, modern, and clean suites throughout the entire college.
Against the backdrop of these slow but transformative renovations, Harvard must take swift steps to address the immediate needs of current campus dwellers (the two-legged ones). Our rooms should never house fungus-inviting pipe leaks, let alone enough small furry animals to cast a Disney movie. Harvard must address the most egregious examples of failing housing swiftly, while taking preemptive measures to limit their emergence elsewhere. That might mean, in the short term, responding to work requests at a faster rate, or tackling pest control from a house-wide approach, rather than room- or entryway-wide. Both faulty piping and insect visits are, after all, more likely to remain contained if Harvard is proactive about tackling them as soon as they appear instead of waiting for the damage (or eggs!) to spread.
Students too must play their part to help keep our Houses and halls clean and hygienic. Wrapping up trash and disposing of it swiftly and properly is imperative for healthy dorms, and the occasional sweeping certainly wouldn’t hurt. Until renovations bless your suite, a squeaky clean dorm may help prevent squeaks of another kind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Freshman year, I met someone for the first time. I met the same guy for the first time again a few months later. And then I met him for the first time, a third time. And then a fourth. And whenever I inevitably cross paths with him next, I will likely meet him for the fifth first time.
Our bizarre reintroduction always follows the same script. He asks me my name and where I’m from. Out of obligation, I return the questions even though I already know his answers. We say nice to meet you. We smile as if we’ve achieved human connection. We go our separate ways.
His blank expression almost makes the whole lapse-in-memory act convincing, though some glimmer behind his eyes tells me that his forgetfulness is pretty deliberate. But I choose to play along each time because truthfully it’s too much time and effort to engage with senselessness.
I can’t take it personally. This guy is hardly the only one with selective memory, and I can’t say I’ve never exhibited it before either. We all choose to forget. Collectively, in fact, we’ve achieved the impressive feat of virtually erasing the past 18 months of reality. Dining halls reverberating with laughter and conversation, packed lecture halls alive with the energy of frenzied note-taking, and the deafening, sticky-floored, poorly-ventilated revelry of contraband dorm parties have expedited the fading of the silent — memories of loss, malaise, and solitary weariness.
Through a strangely intentional memory loss we’ve been able to snuggle back into the grooves of Harvard as it always was — complete absorption into academic intensity, extracurricular aspiration, social competition, and the unceasing buzz of success in progress.
There is something uniquely Harvard, in fact, about turning the passive into the active. We capitalize on forgetfulness to maximize efficiency. Forgetting becomes a useful tool for neatly discarding whatever we deem unnecessary, especially the things that are hard to remember; not because we can’t recall them but because we don’t want to. We choose to forget to save more time to be busy, and to save ourselves from dealing with whatever lies beyond an introduction.
This method of mental prioritization manifests itself weirdly. We “forget” to say hi to people we definitely know. “Forget” to admit that we already know the person we’re meeting regardless of the fact that we follow each other on Instagram. “Forget” to ever again acknowledge the existence of a past hook-up. “Forget” to maintain a friendship that was once quite close, but has now become inconvenient or simply obsolete. In common and uneasy situations like these, we opt out of engagement, channel the thousand-yard stare, and let the memories slip.
Because remembering, after all, is effort. We’re busy people who take pride in conflating bloated Google calendars with self-importance. To recall is to sacrifice valuable mental real estate of which not everyone is worthy. Remembering people and stories and problems takes time we think we don’t have. And sometimes remembering can be nauseatingly risky. To let people in runs the risk of psychological investment. What if they don’t say hi back? If they think you’re an Instagram stalker? If you overinterpreted a relationship? Or, worst of all, what if they realize that you actually had the time to remember them?
The intensity and seriousness with which we perpetuate this all too prevalent behavior are ridiculous, primarily because we don’t forget. We’re at Harvard because we’re good at remembering. Fascinating things. Complex things. And given just how alert and conscientious we are about dynamics within our bubble, sudden memory loss seems doubtful. But what’s even more ridiculous is that in eschewing excess information —  in boiling down our experience to the strictly essential, rushing to discard all the rest, all to save some time and space — we aren’t really left with much at all.
Certainly, that guy I know isn’t saving much time by hearing my life story on repeat, just as that single syllable greeting we’re so hesitant to dole out won’t make us late for class. So this gesture of forgetting must come down to some vague sense of self-worth or self-preservation being satisfaction enough for us. But in trying to save time, face, or energy, we’re only expending it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Experts discussed changing social, cultural, and political norms on abortion access in Latin America at a virtual panel hosted by Harvard’s David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies on Tuesday.
The panel — part of the Center’s Fall 2021 Tuesday Seminar Series — featured University of Sussex Research Fellow Camilla Reuterswärd, Mount Holyoke College Professor Cora Fernandez Anderson, and Harvard Sociology Professor Jocelyn Viterna, who spoke about abortion access in Mexico, Argentina, and El Salvador, respectively.
In Mexico, each of the country’s 32 states has jurisdiction over its abortion policies. The variation within the country — attributable to partisan politics and the strength of religious institutions — “largely mirrors” variations throughout Latin America, explained Reuterswärd.
“The intensity of electoral competition and the ideological positions of party rivals interact with the strength of the Catholic Church hierarchies in a given state to compel parties to pursue policy reform,” she said.
Despite a decision by the Mexican Supreme Court last month that criminalizing abortion is unconstitional, challenges to abortion access in Mexico remain, including enforcement and retaliation, which has occurred in the past, Reuterswärd said.
The decriminalization of abortion in Mexico City in 2007, for example, “ushered in a flurry” of right-to-life amendments in other states, she said.
In Argentina, lawmakers passed legislation in December 2020 that legalized abortion in the first 14 weeks of gestation. Fernandez Anderson lauded the nation’s prominant feminist activists as the “main force” behind the change.
“Activists really understood the party system and realized that they could take advantage of the fact that all the parties actually were divided on the issue of abortion,” she explained. “They began building this multiparty coalition, which was definitely much harder, it took much longer.”
“The emergence of a strong social movement around abortion reform was able to shift the negative perceptions associated with this practice,” Fernandez Anderson added.
In El Salvador, discussions about abortion did not begin until the 1990s, Viterna said. International influences — such as the politicization of abortion by Republicans in the United States — introduced anti-abortion language to the country, she explained.
In 1997, the nation’s criminal code banned abortion in every situation, and in 1999, a constitutional amendment defined life as beginning at conception.
With individual stories, Viterna demonstrated the tangible consequences of abortion bans. A pregnant woman who experienced abdominal pain and accidentally delivered her baby into a latrine was later accused of abortion — a charge that was escalated to attempted aggravated homicide and led to her serving 12.5 years in prison, she said.
“The reality is that life begins at conception in El Salvador, and if life begins at conception, then it’s really hard to tell the difference between abortion and murder, especially when abortion has no definition in the law,” Viterna said.
Following the presentations, Government professor and DRCLAS Director Steven Levitsky moderated a 30 minute question-and-answer session. Viterna noted the importance of social class in access to abortions as a caveat applicable to Mexico, Argentina, and El Salvador.
Future seminars in the series at DRCLAS will focus on populism, technocracy, and protest.

A recent study published by Harvard scientists examined brain tumors in unprecedented detail and found that brain tumor cells shift between distinct states, making them more resilient to cancer treatment.
The study, published in Nature Genetics last month, looked at individual gliomas — the most common type of brain tumors — in unprecedented detail, offering new insights about their classification and genetic architecture.
Researchers from Harvard Medical School, Weill Cornell Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, the New York Genome Center, and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard co-authored the journal article.
Dana Silverbush, a postdoctoral fellow in the Suvà Laboratory at Harvard-affiliated MGH and co-first author of the study, said the researchers found how DNA methylation — cellular marking events that affect gene expression — causes brain tumor cells to change states.
“There are different cell states within the tumor and they probably respond differently to treatments, and we wanted to see whether we could look at the DNA methylation of the tumors — their heterogeneous DNA methylation states,” Silverbush said. “Because the DNA methylation are events that can dictate the cell state, they can dictate how the cells respond to treatment.”
According to Silverbush, the team found that specific “subpopulations” of the glioma cells had different DNA methylation “signatures,” which explains why different subpopulations within the heterogeneous tumors respond differently to treatment and why the whole tumor can survive despite treatment.
“Stem-like” tumor cells targeted by stem-cell-killing treatments, for example, might be regenerated from the tumor’s pool of more mature cells.
Silverbush added that this kind of analysis had been done “in bulk” before with whole brain tumors, but never before “in single-cell resolution.”
Mario L. Suvà, associate professor of Pathology at MGH and co-senior author of the study, wrote in an email that their study is the first to apply “multi-omics” to single brain tumor cells. “Multi-omics” is an analytic approach that draws from aspects of multiple “omes.” In this study, the group analyzed gene sequencing and transcription within the genome and DNA methylation within the epigenome.
The group sampled the individual cells from patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma — an aggressive type of brain tumor that is highly resistant to treatment — and patients with IDH-mutant glioma — a less aggressive type of brain tumor that progresses more slowly.
Silverbush also said that the DNA methylations the group studied can also be viewed as a molecular “clock” leaving “time marks,” which enables the researchers to track a tumor’s evolution.
Silverbush said that the evolutionary analysis revealed the glioblastomas have more “plasticity,” allowing them to “escape” treatments.
“Glioblastomas showed a lot more plasticity, so the cells can easily change their states, which makes them more aggressive, because if you treat the tumor with a certain treatment, it can escape this treatment and adapt to a different state,” Silverbush said.
Suvà said that a key implication of the study for cancer treatment is that the “molecular switches for cell states could serve as targets” for treatment.
Silverbush also said that future research should explore whether methylation events could serve as “markers” to find the “correct, optimal window of interference.”
“These could be markers for when it’s best to intervene because it’s possible that at some point an event happens that makes the tumor less likely to respond to a certain treatment,” Silverbush said. “So this would not be to develop a new treatment but more to know when to use existing treatments.”

Three U.S.-based professors with Harvard ties received the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences on Monday for their work on minimum wage and natural experiments.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded the annual prize in memory of Alfred Nobel to David E. Card of the University of California, Berkeley, Joshua D. Angrist of MIT, and Guido W. Imbens of Stanford University. Half of the $1.1 million prize went to Card for challenging the “conventional wisdom” to show that increasing the minimum wage does not necessarily decrease employment, while Angrist and Imbens received the other half for their work demystifying the process of natural experiments.
Imbens previously taught at Harvard for more than a decade, from 1990 to 1997 and 2006 to 2012. Angrist and Imbens’ work, which began during the latter’s tenure at Harvard in the 1990s, deciphered how to obtain “precise conclusions about cause and effect” from natural experiments. Natural experiments analyze events in the real world — such as fluctuations in the minimum wage — without the controlled environment of a laboratory.
Angrist was an assistant professor at Harvard from 1989 to 1991, while Card served as a visiting professor in 2008.
More recently, Card filed an analysis in federal court in 2018 as an expert witness in support of the University’s race-conscious admissions practices after Harvard was sued by anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions. Card’s analysis found “no negative effect of Asian-American ethnicity” in Harvard’s admissions process.
Card said in an interview that his research in labor economics began in the 1990s when he worked with Alan B. Krueger at Princeton, whom Card said would have been a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize were he alive.
He said his research challenged the prevailing assumption in economics from 1890 to 1990, which assumed that “if you raise the minimum wage 10 cents, somebody's gonna lose their job.” A study he and Krueger designed using a natural experiment comparing minimum wages in Pennsylvania and New Jersey found this was not necessarily the case, which drew “a lot of disbelief from economists.”
Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee, said in a press release that taken together, the three winners’ research demonstrates that “natural experiments are a rich source of knowledge.”
“Their research has substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,” Fredriksson said.
Economics professor David I. Laibson ’88 said he is “thrilled” the trio has been awarded the “highest honor in our profession.”
“I am a huge fan of all of the work that they have done,” Laibson said. “David Card has been one of the most influential economists in the world. During my career, he has influenced all of us with his path-breaking work.”
“The most important thing that their work did is open the door to studies across the social sciences … trying to use natural experiments to answer some of the most important policy questions that we face,” Laibson added.

Faculty of the Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay said she “could not be more pleased” about the Covid-19 positivity rate on campus during an interview last week.
Gay said in the Thursday interview that administrators and faculty are optimistic that the FAS will be able to continue holding in-person classes for the foreseeable future.
“We’re all feeling pretty confident about our ability to maintain the in-person teaching and learning experience that we all value so much and that we’ve all worked so hard to recapture,” Gay said.
The state of the coronavirus pandemic throughout the country, though, continues to cause concern. The spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant, beginning last summer, caused Harvard to temper its confidence surrounding the return to campus.
“Going well into June, there was a tremendous — and I think broadly shared — sense of optimism about the very near-term future, the sense that we were on our way to the other side of this pandemic,” Gay said. “That shifted over the course of the summer, as the Delta variant surged through the country and across the world.”
Referencing remarks made by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 during a monthly faculty meeting earlier last week, Gay said she feels relief that the Covid-19 case count on campus has dropped.
“I believe it was Provost Garber who mentioned some ‘nail-biting moments’ in the early days of the semester when there was a rise in cases,” Gay said. “It is a relief that conditions have stabilized.”
The University has recorded 20 new positive cases over the past week, marking a 0.06 percent positivity rate on campus. The seven-day positivity rate has remained under 0.2 percent the entire semester.
Gay also discussed FAS contingency planning in the case of a graduate student union strike. Last month, members of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers voted to authorize a strike after nearly half a year of contract negotiations with the administration.
Gay said the Office of Undergraduate Education has provided faculty with a “detailed checklist of things they can be doing now” to prepare for a graduate student strike. She acknowledged, however, that the pandemic has further complicated contingency planning for faculty.
“​​I offer all of this recognizing that we’re asking the faculty to take on a lot, including contingency planning, at a particularly difficult time,” Gay said.
In the case of a strike, Gay reiterated that faculty will be held responsible for maintaining all course meetings, including lectures and discussion sections, as well as grading.
“I’m deeply grateful to our faculty for their continued commitment to enabling academic continuity for our students, as well as scholarship in what are new and very challenging circumstances,” Gay added.
Also during the interview, Gay hailed the new Allston Science and Engineering Complex, which welcomed students for the first time this semester, as “remarkable.”
“It’s really exciting to see the SEC building fully open and operational,” Gay said. “I saw it at different stages of development and still nothing could prepare me for the energy of that building when it is fully inhabited and fully activated.”
Gay said that her favorite part of seeing a revitalized campus is the “serendipitous encounters” that she has with colleagues.
“On most days when the weather is good, I eat my lunch just sitting outside on the steps of University Hall,” Gay said. “And I’m using that as a chance to see people that I haven’t seen for a long time.”

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services assistant health secretary Rachel L. Levine ’79 discussed public health challenges in the age of a pandemic at a forum event hosted by the Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics on Tuesday evening.
The virtual forum — moderated by Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy Marcella M. Alsan ’99 — was held in celebration of BGLTQ History Month. Levine made history in March as the first openly transgender federal official to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Before joining the Biden administration, Levine served as Physician General and Secretary of Health for the state of Pennsylvania.
The conversation began with Alsan asking Levine about the role of HHS in addressing social determinants of health “as a key driver of health disparities” in the midst of the pandemic.
“The ability to have an education — that is a health issue. Housing is a health issue. The environment is a health issue. Transportation … that’s a health issue,” Levine said. “Working with the social determinants of health and working for health equity is a priority ... for the administration.”
Alsan steered the conversation toward Levine’s policy views on the opioid epidemic, an issue that was at the center of her agenda as Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health.
“We tend to look at any of these things like overdoses as diseases of despair, and, unfortunately, we have seen more despair, more loneliness and isolation during Covid-19,” Levine said.
Levine explained that she believes public health policy for the opioid epidemic should be centered on four domains — prevention, harm reduction, treatment, and recovery — and supported this claim by bridging the connection between opioid addiction, mental health, and crime.
“We don’t want to incarcerate someone if primarily what they’re suffering from is the disease of addiction, and they have a nonviolent crime. There are other alternatives to incarcerating that person,” Levine said. “You can get them into treatment and into a drug court so they can be monitored as an outpatient, and you can avoid the incarceration in the first place.”
Levine said the pandemic has had an “exacerbated” negative effect on youth mental health, which has sparked innovative initiatives from public health officials.
“One thing that has been shown to be very useful, particularly with teens are suicide hotlines that involve texting,” Levine said. “Using chat or text for suicide hotlines is absolutely necessary if you’re going to make those services available to teenagers.”
Addressing health care challenges faced by the BGLTQ community, Levine said she remains hopeful about the future of health equity.
“It’s amazing that we have a president that champions us,” Levine said. “He is committed to advancing the state and federal efforts to allow LGBTQ+ people to have full access to medical care and really, full access to their civil rights.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three months into his tenure, Harvard University Police Department chief Victor A. Clay said he is looking at changes to HUPD’s response to mental health crises on and near campus in an interview with The Crimson on Friday.
Clay said he has spoken with Harvard University Health Services director Giang T. Nguyen about HUPD and HUHS’s response to mental health crises.
“It’s a little intimidating when you talk about something this important, and you want to get it right,” Clay said. “We were sitting there having a conversation and we were actually making steps — it wasn’t just a conversation — we’re actually problem solving.”
Clay added that HUPD officers are not mental health professionals, and mental health crises should not be a “police issue to the end.”
“We need a partner who’s actually going to respond and take control of those types of situations and we will get there and make sure the scene is safe and everyone is safe and secure,” Clay said.
Clay cautioned that despite the conversation with Nguyen, HUPD has yet to change its policies in responding to mental health crises.
“We haven’t changed any response just yet, but we are in full support of this 24-hour hotline,” Clay said. “[Nguyen is] in full support of us and wanting to have a partner out there that we can count on when we face those types of incidents.”
Clay said a lack of mental health resources had posed a challenge in his past career on the police force, causing officers to respond to situations that should be resolved by mental health professionals.
Clay took over as the head of HUPD in July 2021 after an eight-month-long nationwide search to replace the embattled former HUPD Chief Francis D. “Bud” Riley, who led the department for more than two decades. Riley announced his retirement amid nationwide protests against police violence in June 2020, following intense scrutiny of HUPD triggered by a 2020 Crimson investigation that found instances of racism and sexism within the force.
Clay also discussed the response to a 2018 incident in which the Cambridge Police Department forcibly arrested a Black undergraduate on the night of Yardfest, the College’s annual spring concert.
CPD officers alleged that the student had made aggressive moves toward them. However, bystanders disputed that claim and said the officers punched the student five times in the stomach without provocation. The incident sparked allegations of police brutality and a public outcry.
During that incident, HUHS was originally called regarding a naked male student on Massachusetts Avenue. The student’s location — across from Harvard Law School — resulted in CPD, and not HUHS or HUPD, responding to the call.
Clay said he had spoken to the CPD acting police commissioner Christine Elow about HUPD’s involvement in cases involving Harvard students.
“I told her that I would like it if in the City of Cambridge, within a reasonable distance from campus, something occurs and it is affiliated with our associated to the campus, I would like her to give us a call, especially if it involves a student,” Clay said. “I asked her if we could kind of make that agreement that HUPD will respond, if not to support to even take the handle on some things that involve Harvard students because, like I said, this is our community.”
Clay did not describe Elow’s response to his inquiries.
Clay said that calling the police should not be the uniform response to individuals experiencing acute mental health issues.
“If somebody is in a mental health crisis, I want them to get help,” Clay said. “Just don’t call the cops and say, ‘put this person somewhere.’ That's not what should happen. So we’re working toward a solution.”
“I think that’s one thing too about Harvard, I think we have an opportunity to create a standard,” Clay added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its Ivy League opener, the Harvard Women’s Rugby team (5-0, 1-0 Ivy) showcased its dominance with a 60-8 win over Brown. Performing on Mignone field in front of its large and loyal fan base, the Crimson rallied against a tough and physical opponent for yet another impressive win.
Senior wing Sabrina Kim was ready to rumble off the starting whistle, quickly notching two tries for the team.
“Brown has shown throughout this fall that it is a tough competitor. The team definitely has a lot of skilled players… We can never underestimate Brown,”Kim said. “So I came into the match from the first minute really fired up and wanting to bring everyone else's energy up, too.”
Kim successfully sent this sentiment throughout her teammates. First-year center and fullback PK Vincze pointed to Kim’s immediate tries as a mode of calming the team’s nerves, while also proving that their team is ready to compete.
“I think after that everybody kind of calmed down and thought ‘Let’s keep coming out strong,” said Vincze of Kim’s second try. “That was definitely a big moment for all of us. It’s really great for her to step up and do that.”
Combating a slew of injuries requiring many players to adapt to new positions, the team used this game to build confidence in its depth and versatility. Kim noted that increased communication among her teammates was vital to Harvard’s success in these adjustments.
“We were really focused on keeping the communication high and telling people where we wanted them to be and how we wanted them to play. So we were constantly talking and connecting throughout the game,”Kim said. “A lot of players had to step up this week and fill some big shoes, but I think that we actually played super well as a unit. It didn't really matter at the end of the day that we didn't have some of our regular starters.”
Vincze especially adjusted quickly and successfully to the changes in the lineup and her position as she led the team in scoring with her four tries. Other notable performances included first-year fullback Chloe Headland, who tallied 13 points for Harvard, and sophomore wing Maeve Humphrey, who scored her first try of the season. The noteworthy, enthusiastic reaction by the Crimson’s bench to Humphrey’s try highlighted the team’s positive and supportive atmosphere on the day.
After heading into halftime up 34-5, the locker room mentality centered around driving the energy all the way through to the final whistle. Having anticipated the challenge and physicality of the game, Harvard was eager to maintain its scoring drive in the final 40 minutes.
“[We wanted to] keep up the intensity and pressure we had and play a smart game,”Vincze recalled. “We talked about just continuing to play the way we had been from the beginning and keeping the momentum we had in the first half throughout the rest of the game.”
Vincze took that to heart, needing only the first five minutes of the second half to score two back-to-back tries, elevating Harvard to a 48-5 lead over the Bears.
Looking ahead, the Crimson have a bye week to rest and recover before facing one of its toughest opponents this season, Dartmouth. Nonetheless, Harvard is ready for the challenge, determined to continue to fine-tune the depth and intensity the team displayed in this most recent competition.
“Leading into probably our most competitive match of the season so far against Dartmouth, we're definitely going to remain clinical in how we prepare for the game,”Kim noted. “Whether that's watching film, or getting extra reps in, or having meetings with other players and figuring out what our work needs to be — that’s what we’re going to be doing.”
The last time the two schools faced each other was Nov. 9, 2019, when the Crimson prevailed with a close win of 23-22 in a NIRA playoff match. In the highly anticipated rematch, Harvard will play the Big Green (5-0, 0-0 Ivy) on Oct. 23, at 11 a.m.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Being admitted to Harvard was a little bit sweeter for the incoming class of 2025. Due to the record-high number of applicants, the College accepted an all-time low 3.43 percent of those students into the school, making this year’s class the most competitive in Harvard history.
As competitive as admission into Harvard was for this year’s incoming class, admission for transfer students is even more selective. The College typically receives around 1,500 transfer applications each year. Of those transfer applications, the school accepts on average 12 students per year — an acceptance rate of less than 1 percent. Becoming a member of this cohort means getting through one of the most rigorous admissions processes in the world.
In 2019, the former University of California, Berkeley guard and current junior McKenzie Forbes earned a spot as one of these select few transfer students, which is not surprising given her success both as an academic and an athlete. The McDonald’s All-American will put her nationally-acclaimed on-court talent to use outside of the classroom as one of the newest members of the Harvard women’s basketball program.
While transfer students face the challenge of adjusting to a new environment, McKenzie had a unique advantage. Lavietes Pavilion houses a very familiar face: her brother Mason Forbes, who is a senior on the men’s basketball team and a standout in his own regard.
The 6’8” forward from Folsom, Calif., was a four-year member of his high school varsity basketball program, a three-year starter, and two-year captain of the squad. Having excelled in his time in Folsom, Mason made the transition to college basketball in 2018 — a year that culminated with Harvard men’s basketball reaching the Ivy League finals for the second straight season.
Mason’s success extends beyond the court as well. In June of this past year, the psychology concentrator with a secondary in economics received the Charles Ogletree Humanitarian Award, which is given to the player "who embodies Harvard Law Professor Charles Ogletree's devotion and commitment to selfless service in the Harvard community and beyond."
Furthermore, after Mason co-founded the Harvard Athletics Black Varsity Association and volunteered with the Neighbor Program, which aids the unhoused population in Sacramento, he was named to the 2021 National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Community Assist Team — an honor only six Division I basketball players received this year.
Despite spending a few years at different academic institutions, the Forbes siblings have always been by each other’s sides. The duo played on the same Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team growing up until middle school when McKenzie, who was playing in the same age division as Mason despite being a year younger, made the transition to women’s basketball in her own age group.
Being an elite athlete requires a certain level of competitiveness — a trait that both Forbes siblings have plenty of. Mason and McKenzie also have two older brothers, Marcus and Max, who also played basketball growing up, and this sibling squad fostered competitive spirit in countless two-on-two games over time.
“We were always very competitive,” said McKenzie of her relationship with her brothers. “All three of my brothers got me a lot better just because they weren’t soft on me.”
Mason and McKenzie’s love for basketball and their closeness in age has provided them with a unique advantage.
“I always have someone to go shoot and train with,” McKenzie said. “Especially throughout our high school years, that was a big part of my development because we held each other accountable.”
Mason has found that his game has grown as well from getting to consistently play with another talented and passionate player throughout his childhood.
“Growing up with a sister who was passionate about basketball has been everything,” Mason said. “Because we’re so close in age, we stepped into the world of basketball around the same time and were able to grow and learn more about the game from each other.”
Both Forbes siblings have been playing basketball since they were able to fit a ball in their hands, and the inspiration to pick one up was not hard to find.
Mason and McKenzie’s grandfather, Sterling Forbes, Sr., was an All-American for Pepperdine University, a draft pick of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1960, and a member of the Harlem Globetrotters for three years afterwards.
The basketball bloodline does not stop there, though. Sterling Forbes, McKenzie and Mason’s father, was a Harlem Globetrotter himself and played collegiately at Texas State University and professionally in Argentina.
In the Forbes family, developing standout basketball players is a full-fledged family affair. The mother of the Forbes clan, Sasha, was McKenzie’s first basketball coach.
“I feel like my mom has always been our biggest supporter growing up and was always on top of it as far as getting us to where we need to be while juggling four kids all playing on different teams,” McKenzie said. “I definitely can’t thank her enough for all she’s done to allow me to get to this point.”
With a family full of passion for the game, Mason and McKenzie have created some lifelong memories surrounding the game of basketball. Sterling, the duo’s father, holds basketball camps every summer for kids. Mason and McKenzie fell in love with the game on these courts, spending endless hours on the court before, during, and after their father’s camps.
On their AAU team, Mason and McKenzie even shared the same pregame eating habits. The two used to eat Pixy Stix before games for “energy boosts” as they jokingly recall.
Fast forward a few years, and although the two have deviated from their pregame candy rituals together, they remain by each other’s side.
Physically being by each other’s side and playing collegiate basketball in the same gym, however, was once a long shot for the Forbes siblings. After high school, Mason moved to the other side of the country to play basketball for the Crimson while McKenzie chose to stay in California to play at The University of California, Berkeley. Although the two stayed close during this time, their locations in the country certainly were not.
“Mason was a large part of me considering coming over here,” McKenzie said. “I had come to visit him a couple times, and I just really enjoyed the campus and the people.”
Besides Mason’s role in McKenzie’s decision, McKenzie being able to accomplish her basketball goals was an important determining factor as well. A persuasive argument was made on the court by the Crimson women’s basketball team on Dec. 30, 2018.
Harvard faced off against the 14th-ranked team in the country — none other than The University of California, Berkeley — bolstered by an army of talented players including McKenzie. The Crimson managed to pull off the upset despite McKenzie putting up a career-high 22 points and shooting 75 percent from the floor in the game for the Golden Bears.
“It definitely played a big role in me coming here as far as me saying, ‘Ok, that is a level of basketball where I can still showcase my talent and get to where I want to go as far as playing after college,’” said McKenzie of the Crimson women’s basketball program’s defeat of Cal.
Nonetheless, making the decision to come to Harvard and adjusting to life here are two very different things. Boston and California winters do not have a lot in common, but thankfully McKenzie has Mason to help her transition to being successful at Harvard.
Terms like “the Berg,” “blocking group,” “concentration,” “the Yard,” and “‘Noch’s,” along with a wide array of other Harvard-isms, take a while for any new student to master. But, Mckenzie’s learning curve has been smoother thanks to Mason’s help.
If McKenzie has any questions when Mason is not around, though, she does not have to look far. Mason, along with the rest of the men’s basketball senior class, took McKenzie under their wing, and she now lives with all of them in Lowell House.
“She’s already making Harvard her own,” Mason said of his sister. “I think my work is just about done.”
McKenzie and Mason will both open their 2021-22 campaigns on Nov. 9 at 7 p.m., with McKenzie making her debut on the road at Boston College and Mason starting off at home against Morehouse College.

Masks may protect us against Covid-19, but they definitely do not protect us against awkward interactions. In fact, leave a lot of room for them. What do I mean? Imagine this: you’re walking out of the Science Center and you see someone that you are convinced you remember from a Zoom class. “Omg, it’s Anne!” Obviously, you wave and walk over. As you do so, they take off their masks, and low and behold, they are not who you thought they were. But there you are, standing in front of them. What do you do? Here are some ways you can handle the situation:
Continue the conversation as if you haven’t made a mistake
Admitting to yourself that you’ve messed up doesn’t mean that you have to admit it to the person you are talking to. Confidence despite your error may be key. Ask them about the class you thought you took together. If they look at you confusedly, try to convince them that you were in fact in the same class by, let’s say, mentioning a TF in a super generic way (e.g., “Do you remember her? She was so funny.”) By the end of the conversation that you have just hijacked, you will have convinced yourself that the person you are talking to is, in fact, Anne. If you choose this option, I’d recommend making a swift exit from the conversation as soon as you are done blabbering.
Bail 
Ignore the fact that you just waved at the person and just walk straight past them. Avoid the interaction all together.
Apologize and re-introduce yourself
This is probably the best and most graceful way to go about this unfortunate turn of events. When you reach not-Anne, be honest and apologize; maybe blame the mask or your eyesight for the misidentification. Save your dignity and the poor person’s time by simply introducing yourself for real. Maybe you’ll make a new friend!
Stare blankly at them
This one needs no explanation.
Make sure to always have someone next to you to save you
This one takes a little bit more effort and planning, but always having a friend walking next to you is a solid safety net. Your friend can immediately introduce themselves to not-Anne and then at least you’ll have the actual name of the stranger you are about to talk to.
The shift from Zoom to in-person learning has been challenging in a lot of ways and dealing with misidentifying people has been especially hard to handle. But, cut yourself some slack, because it is HARD to identify someone based almost exclusively on their forehead. A sure-fire way to not misidentify someone in the first place is to make sure their mask is off before waving to them.
