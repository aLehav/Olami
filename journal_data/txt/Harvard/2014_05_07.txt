After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last week, I asked four of my male friends whether they considered themselves feminists. All four said no.
It was an issue of terminology, they said. One was totally down with equality, just not down with a word that inherently implies one sex’s superiority. Another said that, since he isn’t a part of any feminist organizations, he doesn’t feel comfortable claiming the label. I guess these are both fair responses. I, too, have my own issues with the word “feminism” because it brings to mind a movement largely composed of white, middle-upper class women who failed to recognize that certain women of minority groups face a twofold battle.
I should have made my definition clearer, perhaps by reference to the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie sample in Beyoncé’s “Flawless” that defines feminist as “a person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.”
But, when three out of my four male friends agreed that a world vision in which half of our countries and companies are run by women and half of our households are run by men could never be realized, our differences graduated from lexicon to something much more fundamental. Women carry children, one said. Another chimed in and said we can’t expect women to have the same aspirations as men because of those nine months they spend carrying their child and the time they must spend breastfeeding after that.
They told me they didn’t intend me to take their comments personally. But how could I not? How could they tell me that biology destines my sex to be less ambitious and then expect me not to feel offended? 
Forgive me for being emotional (I hear women tend to be that way), but I was deeply hurt. Perhaps my naive belief that all of my friends would be on board with woman’s liberation stems from the fact that I am lucky enough to have a feminist father who tells me that I can do anything I want and an entrepreneurial mother who doesn’t apologize for her success.
She told me to never make excuses: “When you face discrimination, don’t listen or pay it any mind. Just laugh all the way to the bank instead.” I know that I have the power to achieve anything a man can (except for standing up and peeing, although this might change soon). 
What I realize now, though, is how necessary that conversation was, even if it made me upset at first. If I had not asked those friends for their opinions, I would never have known what they believed. I am happy that things got personal, and I am not mad at the boys who disagreed with me. I just know that we both deserve another conversation—another chance to say exactly what we mean and truly listen to each other. The feminist movement will never be effective if it fails to appeal to a broader audience. The people whom I don’t usually talk to about feminism are exactly the people who should be involved in changing gender dynamics on this campus. Because, frankly, there are moments when I feel crushed by the need for change.
One of these moments was the day during my freshman year when I noticed that only one of the guest lecturers for Economics 10 was female. One of my male friends told me I was oversensitive for noticing or caring. I guess he didn’t understand that, while he, as a white male, never has to look very far to find someone who looks just like him in a position of power, others do not have the same privilege. 
I also see our social scene pleading for change. Despite the fact that we perpetually question whether we should attend final club parties, I would be lying if I said that these male-controlled spaces weren’t the most consistent source of parties for my friends and me. And when, in an attempt to maintain capacity and admit only those individuals whose name were on the list that night, a boy whom I would call my friend asked a group of girls outside his club to “please stand in single file against the wall,” I could not help but wonder what kind of attitude this social set-up promotes among the male members of these clubs and the women who wait to enter them.
And, as I wait for the day when Harvard will finally adopt a policy of affirmative consent in an official capacity, I remain frustrated about the fact that the conversation about sexual assault on this campus remains confined to people who are not the real source of the problem. How about the men who have hurt my friends? And the ones who still fail to understand that a woman saying “no” isn’t an invitation to convince her otherwise? These are the ones who must be engaged. 
Boys, I don’t want you to feel offended or alienated by these statements. I believe in the political, social, and economic equality of the sexes. And, when I tell you this, I don’t want you to run away from the pile of burnt bras you might imagine next to me. Instead, I want you to ask questions. Female solidarity should never threaten you—it should invite you to want to learn more.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last year I was at home on winter break scavenging for something to eat in our understocked pantry, when my mom came home from work and burst into tears at the kitchen table. Before I could ask what was wrong, she sat down on the floor, still crying, and explained that work that day had been particularly rough. “I’ve started getting arthritis,” she explained helplessly. “My arms and hands hurt every night. There is no way my body can keep this up, but I don’t have nearly enough saved to quit and still get your sister through school.”
Being poor at Harvard is not like being poor anywhere else. Despite the administration’s “best efforts” freshman year to engage us all in discussions of socioeconomic disparity, most of us at Harvard refrain from discussing personal wealth. Perhaps as a result of this hushed attitude, poverty too often is seen as a mark of failure rather than a situation into which one is born. This attitude is of course not openly expressed. Instead, it manifests itself as a pervasive undertone in many conversations.
Over the last four years, I have become highly aware of the economic disparity within the Harvard bubble, and I am dismayed by how often it is swept under the rug. I know teammates who have skipped dinners because practice ended after dining halls had closed. I know friends who send home money every month to their parents. My own mother is divorced and working two manual jobs to help put me and my younger sister through school. However, I don’t tell many people that most of my clothing is secondhand, or that last year my income as a dorm crew captain was nearly half that of my mother’s. Here, such admissions are taboo.
When facing the issue of economic disparity among students, I think that the Harvard administration does a much more admirable job than its students. Over 70 percent of students are on financial aid, admission is need-blind, and parents earning under $65,000 annually are not expected to contribute to tuition. Grants are available for research and travel, and many school social events can be subsidized through the Social Events Fund.
Harvard students, on the other hand, can at times be incredibly naive. And there have been many times, either in the classroom or in casual conversations, when I have wanted to interrupt one of my peers and explain to them a simple fact that I learned early in life: Money. Is. Important. This is a difficult lesson to learn if you have never dealt with economic hardship.
I decided to co-chair the Senior Gift campaign this spring because Harvard’s financial aid program literally changes lives—it certainly changed my own. I felt like it would be a great chance to raise money for a cause that I really cared about. But I was surprised to find some of my classmates responded with antagonistic or occasionally aggressive attitudes when I asked them if they were considering making donations.
Many of these people explained that they didn’t want to donate because they didn’t feel that they had positive experiences at Harvard, or because they thought Harvard already had “enough money.” For the record, I love that many of my classmates are passionate about other causes in the world. However, when people tell me that they don’t think Senior Gift is important, what I hear is, “I don’t care about financial aid enough to donate to it.”
Hopefully, some of the things I have shared here about economic disparity at Harvard will change your mind on that point. And even if they don’t, at the very least, I hope you will respect the Senior Gift as a valid cause that means a lot to some of your classmates. Please don’t respond aggressively or act antagonized when someone asks you if you have considered donating to Harvard’s financial aid.
Why? Because when I come to you to talk about Senior Gift, I am coming to you as a classmate asking you to donate to a cause that has changed my life. Because making a Senior Gift donation that is earmarked for financial aid is the absolute best way to raise money for this cause—you will be both giving money and contributing to higher participation rates, thus raising alumni donations. Because my mother will have to work fewer years as a gardener battling arthritis since I received this gift from Harvard four years ago. Because when I approach you in the dinning hall to you to talk about it, I am trying to give that same gift to another family.
Again, talking about money at Harvard is hard, and I am not trying to make anyone uncomfortable by sharing my personal experiences. I do not want to guilt people who are fortunate enough not to face these problems into donating, nor am I trying to claim that every student on financial aid feels the same way about these issues that I do. I am simply asking you to take a second and think. Think about economic class at Harvard. Acknowledge the gift that Harvard has given to countless families through their financial aid program, and respect the huge economic disparities found here as a blessing and not a curse.
Our socioeconomic diversity should not make you feel awkward or ashamed—it should make you excited to learn from your classmates and proud of the community that you create together. And personally that is a cause to which I will gladly donate any day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
By now we’ve all heard the spiel about Senior Gift. Whatever graduating seniors donate goes toward funding arts, athletics, and financial aid. These donations are, we are told, crucial. The higher our participation rate, after all, the more inclined our alumni are to donate themselves. 
“Donate,” we are urged, even if we can only spare 10 bucks. “Donate,” we are e-mailed, and texted, and Facebook messaged. We are bombarded with reasons to donate in the hope that one will resonate and stick. Maybe we’re grateful that Harvard accepted us. Maybe Harvard did change our life. Maybe we want to give back. We all have our reasons, we are told. There are excellent, marvelous, insightful, and blessed (really, blessed!) reasons to donate to Senior Gift. 
We hear these braindead megaphones, we become nauseous, and we agree that there are reasons to donate to Senior Gift. And then we give. 
But there are many compelling reasons why one shouldn’t donate to Harvard. A donation to an institution with an endowment of $33 billion, almost none of it spent on its student groups, where 30 percent of students are not on any kind of financial aid (requiring an income in top-one-percent territory) is not exactly the best way to dent socioeconomic poverty. Giving to efficient, conscientious charities—or giving money directly to the poor—works better.
Another reason not to give is to protest Harvard’s problematic ethical positions. Harvard’s refusal to divest its funds from fossil fuel companies, in spite of widespread dissent from its faculty and student body and in spite of the obvious ethical problems in promoting companies that actively accelerate climate change, is at this point no secret. If rallies at Massachusetts Hall lead to nothing but arrests, don’t give to Senior Gift. Hit them where it hurts and zip up your wallet. Refuse to give them a dime until they divest. They’ll listen.
But my personal reason for not donating has to do with poverty. As I’m writing this, I feel that I have to validate my poverty. I never had that sad emotion before Harvard. I come from a single-parent, immigrant household. Mom worked as a housecleaner as my brother and I studied. We would come to dinner, see that our mom’s plate was empty, and be told (in Polish) that she wasn’t hungry. We would look at each other, hesitate, worry, feel our stomachs knot, listlessly eat our food, and retreat to our studies with a newfound, cruel energy.
When we were accepted into an elite high school, free of charge, it meant the world. Here was an opportunity out. 
The high school was free to everyone admitted. People got in because they were smart, not because they could simply afford to pay. If there were books I couldn’t afford, or clubs I didn’t have the cash to participate in, my school took care of that. I was made equal to every other classmate, whether rich, middle class, or poor. And I felt equal. I never felt small. I felt like a student, not a poor student, and that meant everything.
Then I came here. I was told, for the second time: You get in because you’re smart, because you deserve to be here, not because of how much you can pay. I believed it.
Since then, I’ve wanted to believe it, but have spent four years encountering administrative and personal classism instead. I’ve had my poverty, or the effects of my poverty, repeatedly insulted by wealthier classmates unconscious of their insensitivity. I bet it sounds unacceptable for something like this to happen at Harvard, but if you’re really well off and reading this, then you’re likely guilty of this insensitivity yourself.
One fresh example comes from a House’s open email chain. Several students were looking to hire some freshmen as servers for their pre-game. They denied any elitism. They understood elitism as undesirable and bad, but they couldn’t understand how much like a small worm their message made me feel. Or how they might make that poor freshman feel, who will serve them sullenly, obediently, as he thinks about just how much he needs that extra money to buy a school book or toothpaste, which the University will not pay for. 
And on the administration’s end, the same problem arises. I’ve been told that I get full financial aid because I deserve to be here, because I’m an equal human being, fully equal to those lucky enough not to need the aid.
Still, though, I’m asked to write letters thanking my donors for my financial aid. If I don’t respond, I am reminded abstractly and unemotionally by subsequent “REPLY TODAY” e-mails. 
I am told to be grateful. The implicit message remains that I don’t get full financial aid because I deserve to be here; I deserve to be here only because someone covers my full financial aid. I am told that I had better be grateful. That’s how Harvard actually makes me feel.
I feel guilty when I’m back home, where my closest friends are struggling through community college. Here, I feel uncomfortable and small. I am reminded over and over again not only of my economic status but also that my economic status separates me from other, more fortunate students. 
I feel like I should keep silent, because I feel that I have been made silent—I feel small. And because of Harvard, I do feel like a poor student.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
The discussion around fossil fuel divestment turned confrontational last week as members of the Divest Harvard movement, including both undergraduate and graduate students, blockaded the entrances to Massachusetts Hall. Brett A. Roche ’15 was arrested on Thursday morning for taking part in the obstruction.
While we encourage student activism, we cannot condone the tactics used by the Divest Harvard movement. Student movements such as I, Too, Am Harvard and Our Harvard Can Do Better have taken on serious issues of race and sexual assault without disrupting the day-to-day life of Harvard students and administrators.
We believe in an expansive definition of free speech, especially on college campuses. We believe that it is the right of any student or group of students to demonstrate and assemble. Preventing the University from conducting its business, however, is not free speech.
We urge the members of Divest Harvard to continue their protest respectfully, as they have through open letters from students, concerned individuals, and the faculty. Divestment proponents have met with University President Drew G. Faust and representatives of the Harvard Management Company, the Board of Overseers, and the Corporation. In large part, Divest Harvard’s efforts have been constructive, engendering a positive discussion on campus and rightly urging against complacency. Accordingly, the University has shown that it is willing to continue meeting, but Divest Harvard chose to turn away from conversation.
Divest Harvard’s tactics distract us from the debate on climate change that the Harvard community should be having. Turning from reason and persuasion to confrontation weakens the group’s arguments. Divest Harvard’s claims that the University engaged in “repression and … bullying” are tenuous at best—the University did not press any charges against Roche, and he returned within hours. The group has sought to sensationalize the arrest by saying the “administration would rather arrest us than have an open dialogue.” Roche was not arrested for voicing his opinions; he was arrested for obstructing a building.
Divest Harvard has a double standard: While it claims the University has denied it the chance for open dialogue, the group's own methods, such as taking President Drew G. Faust’s statements on fossil fuels out of context, do not foster an environment of intellectual honesty.
As we have noted in the past, the rationale for divestment is not persuasive. The University would continue to use fossil fuels for its everyday functions—and, for the foreseeable future, so will the rest of the world. Right now, renewable energy sources pose significant drawbacks, which means that we could not rely on them even if we stopped using fossil fuels entirely. Given that roughly 82 percent of U.S. energy usage in 2012 came from fossil fuels, we are unlikely to make a smooth transition away from them.
In the end, the best way to fight the use of fossil fuels is to develop new energy sources and technologies. Harvard funds multiple programs, including those at the Kennedy School, Harvard Business School, and the Graduate School of Design, which aim to tackle climate change from multiple fronts.
The problem of climate change is real, undeniable, and urgent. On balance, Divest Harvard’s efforts have forced us to address that fact with more critical minds. Divestment, however, is not the answer. Harvard’s divestment would impact its own ability to fund its climate change research—but it would not have an immediate impact on the multi-billion dollar fossil fuel industry. Even if it did, it certainly does not grant Divest Harvard the right to forcibly disrupt the daily lives of students and administrators.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
A recent set of findings by German researcher Christian Askeland suggest once again that a scrap of parchment thought to be part of a new gospel, the ‘Gospel of Jesus’ Wife,’ which was dated to ancient times just last month, may be a forgery.
The fragment, which is only a few inches in length, has been marked with controversy since Harvard Divinity School professor Karen L. King first presented it in Rome in September 2012. It contains several words in Coptic, an ancient language of Egyptian Christians, that translate to, “Jesus said to them, my wife.” According to King’s translation, the next line reads, “She will be able to be my disciple.”
The authenticity of the piece, though, has recently been cast into further doubt by Askeland, an assistant research professor of Christian origins at Protestant University Wuppertal in Germany.
Askeland has argued that the fragment in question is a forgery by comparing it to another fragment called the ‘Gospel of John,’ which appears to have similar handwriting and which was also given to King by the  anonymous donor of the "Gospel of Jesus' Wife."
Askeland observed that the ‘Gospel of John’ has 17 line breaks similar to the Codex Qau, an authentic text discovered in 1923. Finding this similarity too much of a coincidence, Askeland said that he believes this resemblance indicates that someone forged the ‘Gospel of John’ against the Codex Qau.
Thus, Askeland argues that because of their similar handiwork, the ‘Gospel of Jesus’s Wife’ was likely authored by the same person and may likely be a forgery as well.
The assistant professor further indicated that Lycopolitan, the specific Coptic dialect of the ‘Gospel of John,’ does not appear to have been used between the sixth and eighth centuries, the time to which the fragments have been dated.
In an April article for the Harvard Theological Review, King wrote that MIT and Columbia University had dated the papyrus to be from around the eighth century, and an investigation of the ink by Macquarie University in Australia revealed that there were no clear signs of forgery in the handwriting.
The fragment’s owner, who has remained anonymous, first approached King in December 2011. According to King, the individual who provided her with the fragment, purchased it along with 5 other Coptic pieces in 1999 from a seller who allegedly acquired the pieces in Potsdam, Germany in 1963.
King did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Askeland’s observations. She did comment, though, on these findings earlier in the week to the New York Times.
“This is substantive, it’s worth taking seriously, and it may point in the direction of forgery,” King said.“This is one option that should receive serious consideration, but I don’t think it’s a done deal.”

Members of the Harvard community gathered on Tuesday to display the products of their scientific ingenuity at the third annual School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Design and Project Fair.
Held under a tent in the Science Center Plaza, the event featured over 200 projects created by both graduate and undergraduate students in the fields of engineering, applied mathematics, and computer science.
Attendees were met with a variety of presentations with real-world applications, including a flying drone capable of capturing panoramic images, a hydrofoil kiteboard, and a doorframe that tracks the number of people in a room at any given time.


Students presenting at the fair said that the projects they designed allowed them to discover practical applications for their course material and, in many cases, explore their extracurricular interests.
Neal D.H. Champagne ’17, Eric A. Rodrigo ’17, Ian P. Meyer ’17, and Mark F. Steinbrick ’17, all students in Engineering Sciences 50: “Introduction to Electrical Engineering,” sought to create a project that incorporated their mutual interest in music.
“The members of our group are pretty musical, two of us play guitar, and Ian and I both play saxophone,” Rodrigo said. “So we knew we…wanted to do something musical.”
Inspired by a laser harp presented at last year’s SEAS fair, the group created a laser guitar that simulates the metal strings on a six-string guitar with lasers, producing similar acoustic effects to those of a standard electric guitar.
Near the entrance of the tent was a three-wheel solar-powered vehicle designed by Johnathan M. Budd ’15 and a group of 15 engineers. Already a year into production, Budd said that the group aims to make finishing touches and intends to enter the car in the Shell Eco-Marathon next spring. The competition pits 70 schools against each other as each vehicle attempts to travel a six-mile course using as little energy as possible.
Budd noted that the project, which the team began at the start of the academic year, spawned from a desire to bring together students who shared a passion for engineering.
“We started [the endeavor] because when I first came here there were no really big engineering projects at the school, and I really wanted to have a large extracurricular engineering group on campus,” Budd said.
Students said that the SEAS Design and Project Fair has played a similar role since its inception in 2012, bringing together students, faculty, and spectators with a common interest in innovation.
“This was such a new undertaking, we really had to design everything from the ground up,” Rodrigo said. “It was probably one of the most valuable group experiences I’ve ever been in.”

Brigitte Libby will be the next resident dean of Pforzheimer House, Co-Master Anne Harrington '82 announced in an email to the Pfoho community on Friday.
Libby will move to Pfoho with her partner, Melissa Hancock, a molecular neurobiologist at Harvard Medical School, and their seven-month-old daughter Lucie.
Libby said that she is “thrilled” to begin her new role as resident dean next semester.
“I definitely want students to know that I’m available and enthusiastic about learning who they are,” she said. “I’m really here to help, and I’m really excited.”
A classicist who received a B.A. from Columbia and Ph.D. from Princeton, Libby said she hopes to bring her passion for the humanities to her new role as resident dean. In addition to her administrative role, she will teach one class per semester in the Classics Department.
Libby currently serves as the director of undergraduate studies for the classics department at Boston College, and said she is enthusiastic about the prospect of advising students.
“This is really my dream job,” she said. “I wanted to find a way to teach, but also to spend the bulk of my time talking to students and interacting with them.”
Libby said that she and her family received a warm welcome from the Pfoho community during their visit to the House.
“People were happy to chat in the dining hall, people came over to say hi to Lucie. I’m really looking forward to joining,” she said.
She added that she thinks her young daughter Lucie will fit right into the community.
“We can see her personality emerge, and she’s really social and loves to have a lot of attention, so I think she’ll thrive,” Libby said.
Growing up, Libby alternated living in Paris and Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood. She attended The Winsor School in Boston for high school, and currently resides in Brookline. She and her family will move to Pfoho in July.
Libby said that she felt an immediate kinship with Pfoho’s House Masters Harrington and her husband, John R. Durant.
“They’re so warm, they have so much energy. I know that this is their first year, but they seem like they’ve been doing it forever,” Libby said.
According to Harrington, Libby’s selection as resident dean followed a search process that screened multiple prospective candidates.
“In Pfoho, [Libby] was interviewed, not only by the House masters, but also by House administrators, tutors, and students,” Harrington wrote in an email. “We could not be more thrilled that she has decided to accept the position, and we all look forward to welcoming her and her family—including seven-month old Lucie—to the community!"
Libby will be the permanent replacement for Lisa M. Boes, who left the post in fall 2013.

Awash in natural light and surrounded by the collections of the three Harvard Art Museums, the renovated and revitalized Calderwood Courtyard stands ready to once again serve as the heart of the museums when they reopen on Nov. 16.
With the renovation of the art museums, the courtyard has been significantly opened up by the addition of transparent glass skylights and glass walls on the upper floors of the museum surrounding the courtyard. In addition, the stone walls have been cleaned, the floor has been lifted to match those in the rest of the museum, and walls have been removed from the inside some of the courtyard's arches.
 
“This is a dynamic moment in the history of the institution,” said Kathryn L. Brush, an art historian who has spent most of her academic career studying the history of the Fogg Museum.
“The space is much more dramatic now, with the mix of modern materials and the original courtyard,” Brush said, standing under one of the many arches.
The design of the courtyard was inspired by an Italian villa. The walls are recreations of the villa’s facade, which form an enclosed space at the heart of the museum. Two rows of arches make up the facade and allows guests to see into the hallways that lead to the three different collections, which will all be housed in the renovated building. The arches are constructed with steel beams and stone facing made from travertine that was shipped from Italy when the Fogg was originally constructed in the mid-1920s.
“Americans at the time saw themselves as the heirs of the Italian Renaissance and collected many Italian paintings. Hence, the architectural style reflected one of the strengths of the Fogg Museum's collection in the 1920s,” Brush said.
Although the original stone has been kept in the courtyard, it was restored during the museum renovation. With extensive cleaning, the stone has been lightened and contributes to the new open feeling of the renovated building.
“The building, the institution is going to be revitalized,” said Brush, pointing to the now-beige stone of the courtyard.
Though now covered in plywood and boxes holding items to be installed in the museum, the floor of the courtyard was raised to stand at the same level as the floor of the surrounding museum. The height difference between the two floors previously caused visitors to trip.
“The architect has done a brilliant job of meshing the historic with the contemporary,” Brush said.
The renovated courtyard will be open to the public during museum hours, serving as a space for people to enjoy the new Harvard Art Museums without paying admission to the museum.
“This museum is not just meant for students and faculty, it’s going to have an important public presence as well,” Brush said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard has agreed with to swap two properties in Brighton with the Skating Club of Boston, pending approval by the Boston Redevelopment Authority Board.
Allston-Brighton residents met Tuesday with the Skating Club administrators and representatives from Colliers International, the developer managing the proposed project, to discuss plans to move The Skating Club from its current location on Soldiers Field Road to a Harvard-owned property down Everett Street.
Allston-Brighton residents comprising an Impact Advisory Group, which will advise the BRA, voiced concerns over the scale of the proposed Skating Club facility and the impact it will have on the neighborhood.
“It’s too big for the lot, and it’s too big for the area,” resident Don Laffey said during the meeting. “This thing is going to change the neighborhood forever.”
The $45 million project would involve 153,000 square feet of construction to create a three-rink facility at 176 Lincoln St. Harvard will demolish the vacant technology building standing on the 5.2-acre site before Colliers International commences construction. The Skating Club, founded in 1912, currently occupies a single rink built in 1938 at the 1240 Soldier’s Field Road location west of Harvard Stadium that the University would get in the swap.
The new Skating Club facility will hold between six and ten annual events that will draw as many as 2,000 people, according to Yanni Tsipis, senior vice president of Colliers International. Residents expressed concern over the increased congestion and pressure on parking that these events would bring. The proposed site will include 200 spaces of on-site parking.
Tsipis proposed several strategies to mitigate the effects the Skating Club’s events might have on parking, including providing shuttles to nearby public parking garages and subway stations as well as funding a traffic-calming study for the already congested Lincoln St.
Resident Paul Berkeley, however, said that these strategies would not do enough to solve the parking problem.
“I don’t believe it’s the responsibility of the neighborhood to solve their parking problems,” Berkeley said. “If they’re going to create parking problems, the solution should be coming from them.”
Resident Jane McHale said that the Skating Club could take advantage of Harvard’s large landholdings in Allston-Brighton to alleviate parking overflow.
“The fact is that Harvard has 400 acres—maybe more—of property in our neighborhood,” McHale said. “They are behind this move, and I just don’t understand why Harvard is not here.”
Tsipis stressed that while Harvard will demolish the existing property on the Lincoln St. site, the move was fundamentally the Skating Club’s project.
Elected officials from Allston-Brighton submitted a comment letter to the BRA expressing their disapproval of the size of the project, advocating for a two-rink site instead of three, according to resident Craig Cashman. Developers responded that they are confident that there is demand for three rinks and said that expanding capacity leads to more community programming and attracts families to the neighborhood.
Tsipis requested support from the IAG as the Skating Club and its developer prepare the project to go before the BRA board on May 15. Harvard has not informed the IAG of any potential plans for the current Skating Club site after the proposed land swap.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: May 7, 2014, at 5:27 p.m.
Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, the chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the controversial book “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,” will address the Harvard College Class of 2014 at this year’s Class Day exercises on May 28, the University announced on Wednesday.
An economics concentrator as an undergraduate, Sandberg studied under former University President Lawrence H. Summers and went to work for him at the World Bank after she graduated from the College in 1991. Sandberg eventually returned to the University and earned a MBA from the Business School in 1995. After spending time at McKinsey & Company, Sandberg worked at the Treasury Department under Summers from 1996-2001 and then went to Google, where she was the company’s vice president of global online sales and operations. Sandberg settled at Facebook in 2008.
“Her career has spanned government, business, and tech. She took huge risks professionally, joining both Google and Facebook in their early days when each company’s business model was not yet certain,” Ginny C. Fahs ’14, a marshal for the Class of 2014 and a Crimson Magazine editor, said of Sandberg in the University’s press release. “She is an inspiring leader, activist, and businesswoman. We are overjoyed that she will be addressing us at Class Day.”
In 2013, Sandberg, along with magazine and television writer Nell Scovell '82, a former Crimson editor, published “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead,” a book which examined the obstacles that she believes women face in the professional world and proposes means of overcoming them. LeanIn.org, a spinoff of the book, describes itself as an organization “committed to offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals.” Sandberg has faced criticism for what some see as a class-based solution to gender inequality in the workplace.
Shortly after releasing the book, Sandberg visited Harvard last spring to promote the “Lean In” initiative.
“For the 21st century, the central moral issue of our time is the oppression of women and girls around the world,” Sandberg told a packed Sanders Theater. “We have a leadership ambition gap, and until we fix it, we will not solve the leadership gap.”
Class Marshal Roland Yang ’14 said in the release that Sandberg’s advocacy has “sparked valuable discussions within our class and around campus.” He added: “Her ideas and example challenge us to think and act critically as soon-to-be graduates.”
In early March, the University announced that former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a 1966 graduate of Harvard Business School, will deliver the keynote address at Harvard’s 363rd Commencement exercises on the morning of May 29. Previous College Class Day speakers include Soledad M. O’Brien ’88-’00, U.S. Rep. Barnett “Barney” Frank ’61-’62, and comedian Andy Samberg.

By now we’ve entered the heart of reading period, and students are becoming all too familiar with everything library. The design of desks, the furniture upholstery, and of course the quirks of each bag checker. Some will greet you with a “good evening” at 12 in the afternoon, and others seem to only know one word: “Books.” For all those times that you’ve wanted to take the conversation a little further, we present the Top 7 Bag Checker Conversation Starters!
1. Lotta books tonight?
Some nights bag-checkers see a lot of books, other nights they might also see a lot of books, but maybe less? This is like the equivalent of asking a taxi driver if it’s been a busy shift.
2. Have you caught any book thieves lately?
Judging by the full Securitas army stationed at every library entrance, I have to guess that some book burglary must go on. If this guy had been a little less conspicuous he might have even been able to nab the Gutenberg Bible.
3. Do you have a favorite library on campus?
A nice friendly question, and who better knows the libraries than they do. Maybe they’re a classic kind of person and prefer Widener, maybe they’re super trendy and like the Graduate School of Design library. 
4. What’s the strangest thing you’ve found lately?
Students carry all kinds of strange stuff with them, maybe your bag checker has a good story about the time a student tried to smuggle out a stapler or an exact replica of a human skull.
5. Does it seem quiet in here?
Lame jokes are great for filling that long awkward silence in between the time it takes you to open your bag and close it.
 6. How about the weather?
Seriously a winner every time and there’s ALWAYS something to complain about.
 7. Would you like to take a selfie?
