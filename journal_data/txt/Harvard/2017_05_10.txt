After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Summer 2017 is around the corner and I am nervous for the arrival of warmer months.
We all know summer as “bikini season,” “sundress season,” or generally just as the season where we wear less and go out more. The thing is, I’m not always comfortable with my body. I would be lying if I said I felt confident about myself all of the time, especially in the season where our bodies take center stage. I don’t have huge boobs and my stomach isn’t flat. I have cellulite on my butt and my thighs jiggle when I walk and seemingly expand for miles when I sit down. Most days, I don’t mind any of those things. In fact, I embrace them. But on other days, I do mind.
It’s hard to always love my body when all the summer images of women look so different from me. Whenever I look at a TV or movie screen, I see women whose bodies are so sculpted that it make me feel lackluster. Whenever I see models on Instagram promoting some new exercise regimen or slimming tea product, I look down at my own body. I know that what I see is not all that meets the eye, but the task of differentiating between real and fake is so difficult that summer becomes a stressful season.
And the greatest irony is how arbitrary this perfect “bikini body” is. Take, for example, thickness. A few years ago, having curvy bodies, especially larger butts, was not in “style.” In my predominantly white neighborhood, I watched thin soccer moms talk about how grossly large their butts were getting. I would look at mine and be sad thinking about how “mine’s even bigger.”  I remember a boy telling me in middle school that I should diet because my butt was too big. Yet when I would go to Miami to see my family, I would hear women talking about how flat their butts were and how they needed to wear their fajas while doing squats. Sometimes they would talk about having surgery to make their butts bigger.
I didn’t know what was beautiful and what wasn’t. All I felt was that I was not. I went on a diet, just like the middle school boy “recommended,” and I lost 30 pounds. I had finally achieved the body of my dreams―I had a thigh gap, abs, and a distinct outline of my ribs. Or so I thought. I was a size 0 but I was still unhappy.
Summer that year came around and I remember trying on a swimsuit and thinking that nothing filled out. I felt flat and I cried in the dressing room because I looked nothing like the impossibly thin model who somehow still had large boobs. I couldn’t understand why I still hated my body when I thought I had achieved perfection. I didn’t wear a swimsuit that summer, or the next two summers.
When high school began, I started gaining weight and searching for validation. But no matter how often guys or my boyfriend would tell me that I was “fine as hell,” I never felt right. I became a size 6—and “lucky” for me, my change coincided with the new wave of mainstream media approval for “curvy” women like Kim Kardashian. I thought I’d finally found happiness with my curvier look, except I started seeing that curvy women in the media like Kim had boobs and butts larger than mine but waists that were somehow smaller. Once again, I felt like there was nothing I could do to change myself to look like women I didn’t even know.
It took until the summer of my junior year of high school to begin realizing how badly I was treating myself. I started noticing  how I would suck in deeply every time I took a picture. And how I would pick myself apart for the smallest things. I started forcing my thoughts in a positive direction. In fitting rooms, I would think about how “great” my waist looked instead of how “bad” my arms did.  I’d be lying if I said that the transition was easy. There were countless days where I would felt like this self-praise was a lie and that I was shielding myself from the truth of my ugly body. Yet for every one of those days of doubts, I would have a day of love for every inch of my brown skin―stretch marks and cellulite included. The more I told myself I was beautiful, the more I started to believe it, and the more I knew that it was true.
I did go to the beach in a bikini that year. Lying on the towel in the sand, I was tempted over and over to put a shirt on, put some shorts on, anything but wear a bikini. I didn’t. Senior summer, I wore a bikini again. Soon, summer 2017 will be here and I’m nervous. But I know I will be at Carson Beach in a bikini again because my body is beautiful.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: You’re a senior in high school and your hands are shaking because you’ve just opened the admissions portal to see that you’ve been admitted to Harvard—or, as all your relatives pronounce it, Járvar. You jump on a plane from Los Angeles, Texas, or Florida, and land in Boston. It’s way colder than you’d imagined, but your shining smile and the glow from your brown skin make it bearable. This place is the place for you: You’re sure of it.
Zoe: I had a big dream. It was a dream that my family had never dreamed before: I wanted to go to college and, better yet, I wanted to leave the state that had been my home my entire life. I wanted to be all of the dreams my single mother could never realize. I wanted to be those classes she didn’t get the chance to take and the success she could have had if she had been zoned to a better school in a zip code whose residents didn’t have an 8% college graduation rate. I was the hope for a future that was going to be different. I didn’t cry when I opened that admissions packet, but I have cried since I got here.
R: Your freshman roommate is white. Back home, you didn’t have that many white friends—segregated, underfunded high schools tend to be missing them—but it’s a welcome change. You tell him about the country your parents grew up in and he tells you about his life. You’re playing out the admissions office’s wet dream by connecting with a peer across backgrounds and cultures. If you listen really closely, you’ll hear the sounds of the people who organized your housing high-fiving each other. Dean Khurana is crying tears of joy somewhere.
Z: I struggled to lug my entire life up the four flights of stairs in my freshman dorm, and the next day, I struggled to hold back tears when my roommate’s entire family moved her in and would go on to frequently visit. It’s not as if I don’t also have a big family that can fill the room with its laughter and love, but my family just can’t afford to fly to Boston. I thought I was ready: I had gone to an early-college high school, I had received my associate’s degree, and I had taken the couple of AP classes that were offered. I was supposed to be college-ready; they told me I’d be college-ready.
R: The University doesn’t support you. When you experience the worst mental health problems you’ve ever faced, you’re unable to find a clinician who understands what it means to exist in the world without white skin. You turn to the peer counseling group meant to deal with issues of race and you find that they’ve taken a semester off because they’re understaffed. You can’t turn to a professor because faculty of color are rare and those that are present are overworked. You don’t know how to navigate an institution that was not built for you, and there’s nobody to teach you. There is no bridge program. There is no multicultural center. An administrator gives you excuses and sends you on your way.
Z: My first classes found me quickly realizing I wasn’t ready to be surrounded by students who had gone to mini-Harvards in the form of prep schools and boarding academies. I wasn’t ready to question my intelligence and wonder if I was the only one who wasn’t fit to flourish at this institution. I wasn’t ready to grapple with feeling like a disappointment and with there being no one for me to turn to who would understand what it was like to be dropped in a place completely different from anything I had ever known. I wasn’t ready to constantly be aware of how different I was: a first-gen, low-income Latina raised by a single mother, constantly hit with the “maybe Zoe can speak to that?” in a room filled with people who couldn’t come close to understanding even one of those experiences, let alone all of them at once.
R: By the end of your sophomore year, you’re exhausted. You’re tired of having to explain how brown and poor you are. In a Crimson meeting, you have to explain to a room full of near-strangers about how the financial aid program works if your family makes less than $65,000 per year. Administrators ask you to serve on yet another committee. But a shift has occurred—you’re beginning to learn how to navigate the white space that surrounds you. It’s unfair that your rich white classmates knew how to navigate this University as soon as they stepped on campus, but you’re finally learning.
Z: I have tried not to come across as ungrateful for the privilege that I have been afforded at this university while demanding the changes I wish had been realized before I came here. But I’m tired—I’m tired of having to explain how my identities impact the way I navigate this institution, only to have it fall on deaf ears. I am tired of being overcome with emotion when, yet again, the administration refuses to acknowledge that my experiences are different because I come from an intersectionally marginalized background, and that no, we are not all homogenous privileged Harvard students. The hard transition I had here, the effects of which I still experience, isn’t the same transition felt by those students who just have to learn how to do their own laundry for the first time. If I am never able to forget the disadvantaged background I come from and how my experiences come together to inform everything I do, the University should also be unable to forget I am being lost in the cracks. My differences deserve resources.
R: As we close out another year and prepare to send another graduating class out into the real world, it’s critical that the University acknowledge that not all Harvard experiences are created equal. Latinx students should not have to learn to navigate this university blindfolded. A bridge program that would facilitate the transition for students of color—many of whom are first-generation, low-income, or come from under-resourced high schools—should be fully rolled out. Faculty, mental health services, and advising teams must be as diverse the student body is. The Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion should never again go more than seven months without a dean. Navigating Harvard as a Latinx student should not be a painful process.
It’s your senior year. Some hotshot celebrity is your commencement speaker. You grab your diploma and, alongside the joy and pride you feel, you hope that the brown boys and girls who are going to walk through the Yard in years to come will have it easier. You know they’ll never have it easy, but you hope Harvard will acknowledge the struggles of being brown at a white institution and will help them along the way.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a relatively quiet year, Harvard’s most famous—or perhaps notorious—course has made headlines once again. The Crimson reported recently that Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I”, Harvard’s introductory computer science course, submitted nearly ten percent of its students to the Honor Council for suspected academic dishonesty last fall, a wave of over 60 cases that has taken months to assess.
While we wholeheartedly condemn any proven acts of cheating by individual students, many students felt that the course’s honor policy was too vague, leading to unintentional potential violations.
The course has an open-ended and amorphous honor policy, under the banner of being “reasonable.” We understand that the collaborative nature of computer science requires students to work together, and may thus make promulgating strict rules about plagiarism more difficult.
In our view, however, this only underlines the importance of head instructor David J. Malan ’99 and the course staff finding a solution that reconciles the need for collaboration and the gravity of academic integrity. Though the course staff have undoubtedly given this matter some thought, we urge them to more explicitly delineate what is allowed and what is unacceptable. That many of the accused students allege that they were unaware of having done anything wrong may suggest that the honor policy was simply not reasonable enough.
This was exacerbated by Malan’s choice to review potential academic integrity issues primarily at the close of the year, preventing students from being able to correct their understanding of what was appropriate mid-semester. Drawing these distinctions is especially difficult for freshmen, who do not have experience with Harvard’s norms of appropriate collaboration and make up many of the students enrolled in CS50.
We are also disappointed that Malan would choose to stretch the limits of the Honor Council’s abilities. With only 30 members, it is ill equipped to simultaneously investigate the numerous cases of academic dishonesty that he presented after the close of the course. It suggests a careless disregard for both the Council and the accused students, as many cases were only resolved recently, more than four months after the course ended.
That said, we remind students who find themselves in situations that seem conducive to cheating that grades and academics are not more important than integrity. Whatever the short-term benefits of academic dishonestly, the penalties are far greater. More importantly, it is wrong to do.
This staff editorial solely represents the majority view of The Crimson Editorial Board. It is the product of discussions at regular Editorial Board meetings. In order to ensure the impartiality of our journalism, Crimson editors who choose to opine and vote at these meetings are not involved in the reporting of articles on similar topics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston Latin School, a competitive Mass. public high school, will have to turn over documents relevant to an ongoing lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian American applicants after a court ruling Tuesday.
Students for Fair Admissions, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, served Boston Latin a subpoena earlier this year requesting the school produce documents on the racial composition of applicants and admits to Harvard. The group also requested any internal or external communications of alleged racial discrimination against Asian Americans in the college admissions process and the deposition of a school representative.
Though Boston Latin moved to quash the subpoena in April, a Mass. district court ruled that the school would have to fulfill SFFA’s requests for documents in four categories: Boston Latin’s documents on the racial composition of Harvard applicants, internal communications on Harvard’s use of race in its admissions processes, documents describing alleged race-based discrimination by Harvard, and other “non-privileged communications” about SFFA or the lawsuit. The court also granted SFFA permission to question a representative of Boston Latin.
But the high school will not be required to produce “documents or information that were prepared by or shared with Harvard,” as well as other documents not specified by the court.
The order intends to “minimize the burden on non-party [Boston Latin], while also ensuring the availability of information and the integrity of the discovery process,” according to the court.
Edward Blum, the president of SFFA, told the Boston Globe that as long as the case does not go to trial, the documents will not be accessible to the public.
Boston Latin is one of four top high schools across the country that received subpoenas from SFFA. Though two of the other schools have already agreed to comply with the subpoena, Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va. is currently awaiting a decision on its motion to quash.
According to SFFA, these subpoenas will highlight the experiences of high school administrators and counselors who may be witness to race-conscious admissions policies at Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A former Harvard post-doctoral researcher is suing a chemistry professor whose lab he worked in, alleging that the professor unfairly excluded him from a potentially lucrative cancer treatment patent.
Alexander Arefolov—who worked in the laboratory of Matthew D. Shair from 2011 to 2015 and filed the suit on May 4—claims he contributed to research on the compound cortistatin A. After the drug was licensed to Merck &Co. last year, though, Arefolov said his name did not appear on the list of inventors, cutting him out of monetary returns.
According to Arefolov’s complaint, Shair and others listed as inventors on the cortistatin A patents have received almost $6 million in patent royalties, and Harvard received an up-front payment of $20 million.
The post-doc was the only chemist other than Shair working in the lab when he started there, according to the complaint. The lawsuit further alleges that Shair repeatedly reassured Arefolov that he would be recognized on the patent.
“As an integral team member of the Cortistatin A Project for four years, Dr. Arefolov was involved in almost all aspects of the project,” the complaint reads. “Four years of lab notebooks, personal journals, email correspondence, and the testimony of the scientists working on the Cortistatin A Project will bear that out.”
The lawsuit also claims that the University failed to review the work of students and post-docs when determining inventorship—instead, the University allegedly relied on Shair to determine who would be given credit for the invention. Given that Harvard generally requires patent royalties to be shared equally between inventors, the complaint continues, omitting Arefolov from the inventors list could have increased Shair’s slice of the profits.
In a statement to the Boston Globe, University spokesperson David Cameron declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Arefolov’s attorney, Brian D. O’Reilly, previously represented Mark G. Charest, a former Harvard Ph.D. student who filed a similar suit in 2013. After roughly three years, Charest settled with Harvard in the summer of 2016.

Barry’s Corner—the 9.3-acre slice of Allston at the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue—doesn’t quite look like the future of Harvard University.
The streets are mostly void of pedestrians. There’s a bakery, a pizza place, and a sleek new apartment complex still seeking its last retail tenant for its ground floor. The compact neighborhood is unassuming, for now mostly a thoroughfare between Harvard—a mile to the north across the Charles River—and the more bustling areas of Allston to the south.
But as Harvard pursues what University President Drew G. Faust has called “a future in which all roads lead to Allston,” it has big plans for Barry’s Corner. Revitalizing the once-vibrant neighborhood is a cornerstone of the University’s ambitious Institutional Master Plan for Allston.
And Harvard has history working against it. Many longtime residents are skeptical of redevelopment plans—the last of which, in the 1960s, razed every home in the neighborhood—and Harvard’s secret land acquisitions in the 1990s did little to foster town-gown relations.
Whether Harvard can successfully transform the quiet corner into the “engaging public realm” it envisions may provide a blueprint for the University’s future across the Charles.
'To Hell with Urban Renewal'
Long before Harvard set its sights on Barry’s Corner, the Boston Redevelopment Authority—a local government agency responsible for municipal planning—had another plan for the neighborhood. In 1961, according to the Brighton-Allston Historical Society, the BRA put forward a plan to demolish all 52 buildings in Barry’s Corner to make way for future development.
Residents received letters notifying them that their houses had been taken by eminent domain. Over the next few years, McCall and others recalled, residents mobilized and protested the redevelopment for years.
Despite intense backlash, the BRA moved forward with the redevelopment plan. As police and moving trucks came in to evict the remaining families, hundreds of demonstrators stood in their way. Nonetheless, the last homes were razed in 1969.
Irene S. McCall, a 92-year-old lifetime resident of Barry’s Corner, said her family was displaced by the BRA.
“We had a beautiful childhood there,” McCall said. “They called it a blighted area and it wasn’t blighted. It was a beautiful area.”
Kairos Shen, a BRA staffer since the 1990s and Chief Planner of Boston until 2015, said the BRA he knew was a “very different agency” than it had been in the years after it formed in 1957.
“I know that it is hard for many community members to think of the agency in this way, but during the time I worked for the agency, the BRA was very sensitive and inclusive of the community’s concerns,” he said.
Still, according to Tony D’Isidoro, a board member of the Allston Civic Association, this chapter of Barry’s Corner’s history has made many Allstonians “suspect” of new development ever since. When Harvard entered the picture as the key developer of Allston, residents say they were wary that the relationship would also be a one-way street.
Navigating Town-Gown Relations
When Harvard chose Allston—though home to the Harvard Stadium since 1903 and the Business School since 1927—as its new frontier, it got off to a rocky start. While the University now has several projects in motion, including a $1 billion science complex, a hotel and conference center, and a new basketball venue, the initial revelations of its land purchases in Allston unsettled residents.
In 1997, Harvard announced that it had secretly obtained 52 acres of land in Allston through a real estate firm. Though Harvard officials defended their land acquisition as economically “prudent,” the University paid a price in its public relations.
Former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino wrote a letter to then-University President Neil M. Rudenstine arguing that the move reflected “'the highest level of arrogance seen in our city in many years.”
The anonymity of the acquisitions also fostered tensions between Harvard and Allstonians, many of whom initially distrusted Harvard’s plans for their neighborhood.
Four years later, the day after Lawrence H. Summers was announced as Harvard’s next University President in 2001, Summers said, he called Menino in hopes of strengthening Harvard-Boston relations.
“When I got there, there were still very substantial scars from the secret purchasing,” Summers said.
Over Summers’s tenure, the University sought to rebuild trust through by sending representatives to Allston meetings and supporting neighborhood projects, he said. Summers said what residents call a lack of communication was often a result of complicated internal processes.
“So often what others regarded as non-transparency was really just Harvard not knowing the answers to the questions. We couldn’t tell them what we didn’t know,” Summers said.
Town-gown relations seemed to be on an upswing, Summers said. But in 2009, after the value of Harvard’s endowment dropped by nearly 30 percent, Faust announced she would halt Allston expansion plans.
The announcement was met with frustration and disappointment from residents, many of whom said they were wary of Harvard’s commitment to their neighborhood.
Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey said Faust aimed to set a tone of “making a commitment that is deliverable and meeting milestones to build a level of trust with our community stakeholders” given the global financial collapse. Faust also commissioned the Allston Work Team, a 14-member committee tasked with making recommendations for Harvard’s future in Allston in the aftermath of the recession.
Equipped with the Allston Work Team recommendations and Faust’s goals, Harvard Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp began developing a new ten-year master plan for Allston, where the University now owns 358 acres of land—143 acres more than it does in Cambridge.
In Oct. 2013, and after months of heated negotiations between Harvard and Allstonians, the BRA approved a scaled-down Institutional Master Plan for Allston development, including a new Barry’s Corner Residential and Retail Commons and a $43 million community benefits package.
An 'Up-and-Coming' Neighborhood
That December, Faust and Menino—wearing long dark coats and bearing shovels—ceremonially broke ground on the Barry’s Corner project, a retail and residential complex Faust said she hoped would bring “new energy to the intersection between Harvard and the Allston community.”
Nearly four years in, though, revitalization seems to be a work in progress. While some Harvard graduate students have moved to the area, many say Barry’s Corner is more subdued than Cambridge and the rest of Allston.
“I think it’s an up-and-coming area, but it is kind of slow right now,” said Kelly Burke, a Business School student who currently lives in Continuum, a luxury apartment and retail development that began leasing apartments in 2015.
Andrew Alesbury, a student at the Kennedy School and Design School who lives just outside of Barry’s Corner, said the area “feels a bit like a moonscape with the massive parking lots.”
“Only the Continuum building makes it feel like you’re not standing out in the middle of a foreign planet,” he said.
For lifetime residents like McCall, too, the neighborhood has noticeably quieted since her childhood. “It doesn’t even feel like Barry’s Corner anymore. There’s nothing here,” she said.
There are, however, signs of progress. According to Samuels & Associates—the developers Harvard selected in 2012 to build Continuum—grocery store Trader Joe’s and restaurant Our Father’s Deli are slated to open Barry’s Corner locations later this year.
“There’s certainly more work to do, but when I started working in the neighborhood a decade ago, there was no Stone Hearth Pizza—that was a gas station,” said Gerald Autler, a senior project manager for the Boston Planning and Development Agency. “There was no Swissbäkers—that was a Volkswagen dealership. There was certainly no mixed-use residential and retail development like Continuum.”
No Place like Home
Larger concerns loom as well. Allstonians have called for more affordable housing and increased homeownership in the neighborhood, a rental-dominated area that has one of the lowest homeownership rates in Boston.
Jo-Ann Barbour, the executive director of Charlesview Apartments—a mixed-income development in North Allston—said the neighborhood is in need of more affordable units for low-income residents.
“We have a waitlist of over 1,300 people. We moved in six new families last year. The turnover is very low,” said Barbour.
Rita M. DiGesse, who has lived in the same house in North Allston for the past 87 years, is one of many residents who have expressed concern about the impact of “transient populations” on Barry’s Corner: Residents “who come and go” and “probably don’t even know their neighbors,” she said, contribute to a lack of cohesion in the neighborhood.
“There’s more civic engagement when people are invested in the area and have something to protect,” agreed D’Isidoro, an Allston Civic Association board member.
Both the BPDA and Harvard officials have acknowledged these concerns, and part of the University’s community benefits package has been earmarked for housing initiatives.
On the Mend
Despite concerns about housing affordability and the slow rate of change in the neighborhood, both Allstonians and Harvard officials say town-gown relationships are improving.
The Harvard-Allston Task Force was appointed by the BRA in 2006 as a neighborhood advisory group for Harvard’s Allston developments. Residents continue to bombard the University with questions and requests at Task Force meetings because expectations of Harvard are higher now, said Shen, the former chief planner of Boston.
“There are things that they can ask Harvard that ten years ago would have been unthinkable to ask,” he said.
Casey, the Harvard spokesperson, agreed. “We had constructive tensions over issues because they were challenging us to do more,” he said.
And as Harvard works towards Faust’s imagined “future in which all roads lead to Allston,” Casey said, integrating North Allston residents with the University is “built into the design.” Plans for the new School of Engineering and Applied Sciences complex include multiple entrances along Western Ave. that lead to a food court and a green space open to the public, he said.
Design School professor Gary R. Hilderbrand, a member of the University’s landscape architecture team for Allston planning, said his team is focused on creating “well-organized, shaded streets that prioritize walking and mass transit, accommodate bicycling safely, and bring liveliness and activity” to the neighborhood.
D’Isidoro and other Allstonians, too, are hopeful. After “a part of the community was severed in a very dramatic way” during redevelopment in the 1960s, former Barry’s Corner residents continued to hold reunions that were “unbelievably well-attended,” he said.
For D’Isidoro, Harvard’s Barry’s Corner developments may be a way to revive the sense of home that once existed at the corner of North Harvard St. and Western Ave.
“We are hopeful and optimistic that the sense of spirit and energy that was once present here will be back,” D’Isidoro said. “A lot has changed, but if done right, this could be a dynamic public square again.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company is aiming to sell around $2.5 billion in private equity, venture capital, and real estate assets as part of its broader revamp in investment strategy, according to reports in Bloomberg and Axios.
According to the reports, HMC is seeking buyers for around $1.6 billion in real estate and almost $1 billion in private equity. 
HMC's moves to sell the assets come as recently-installed CEO of the firm N.P. Narvekar reconsiders much of Harvard’s approach to endowment investing.  In January, the company announced plans to lay off half its staff by the end of the calendar year after financial reports revealed that Harvard’s endowment lagged significantly behind those of its peers.
At the time, HMC also announced it would alter its investment model. Harvard has historically employed a unique “hybrid” investment model, in which HMC retained a large internal staff while also hiring external employees. Narvekar has opted to move HMC towards relying more on external funds to manage Harvard’s $35.7 billion endowment.
Narvekar made the changes after HMC posted negative 2 percent returns on its investments and the size of the endowment shrunk by nearly $2 billion. These losses have already prompted Harvard to reduce pay bumps for some employees and faculty.
The endowment’s lackluster performance could constrain budgets across Harvard for years, University President Drew G. Faust said in September.
HMC spokesperson Emily Guadagnoli declined to comment on HMC’s efforts to sell $2.5 billion in equity, capital, and investments.

The full results of an external review of the culture of Harvard’s Athletics Department will not be made public, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith said in an interview on Friday.
This spring, the Athletics Department began working with a team of consultants from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports to review the culture of the department’s 42 varsity programs. Smith did not provide a timeline for the report’s completion.
Smith said that some of the report’s findings will be made public, but that he does not plan on releasing the entire report.
“It’s certainly involving the students,” Smith said. “So I think having an abundance of caution here to make sure we can do the appropriate investigation, talking to the right people, without having them feel like their comments are going to be released publicly tomorrow, and they can actually tell us exactly what they’re experiencing.”
Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise began the review after two highly publicized incidents in the department. The men’s soccer season was cancelled after the the Office of General Counsel found that the team had repeatedly created a sexually explicit document ranking members of the women’s team. And the Athletics Department placed the men’s cross country team on “athletic probation” after The Crimson reported that the team created annual spreadsheets with “sexually explicit” comments about the women’s cross country team.
The investigation will include a survey of student athletes, coaches, and staff, as well as focus groups and individual interviews.
“Obviously we will say something about the report and the findings that’s appropriate for our community so that we can move forward with this and the recommendations,” Smith said.
The cultural review is one of several different investigations and evaluations taking place in the Athletics Department. The Department is also reviewing how it compensates the coaches of men’s and women’s teams; the head coach of a men’s team at Harvard makes, on average, $34,000 more than the coaches of women’s teams, according to data from the Department of Education.
Harvard is also looking into complaints raised by the women’s rugby team about the Department, and the Human Resources Department is reviewing Patrick Wales-Dinan, a coach in the women’s distance running and cross country program.
“We obviously take very seriously these sorts of claims and want to investigate then,” Smith said.
Smith said he is hesitant to “prejudge” what will be the results of the various investigations.
“I know there are challenges that I’ve heard and I’m interested to see the reports, the depth of them, and what we might do to rectify it,” Smith said.
Smith said this year’s incidents have led to increased communication about athletics between him and University President Drew G. Faust.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In August of 2012, the Athletics Department announced that the women’s rugby team would become Harvard’s 42nd varsity team.
The change, years in the making, was expected to improve the team’s ability to recruit athletes. With more backing from the Athletics Department, students at the time hoped, women’s rugby would become more competitive and rigorous.
But almost five years later, some current and former members of the program charge that the Athletics Department has still not done enough to support the team. Members of the team argue that the program does not receive enough recruiting spots or equitable compensation for their coaches, among other concerns.
“We understood the elevation of rugby to mean that rugby thereafter would be treated the same as other Harvard varsity sports,” wrote members of the women’s rugby program in a letter to University President Drew G. Faust in October 2016. “That has not been the case. We are still treated by the Athletic Department more like a club team than a varsity team.”
In a series of meetings with and letters to administrators over the past year, Parker, Learned, and other women’s rugby affiliates have repeatedly criticized Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise and the Athletics Department for its treatment of the program, arguing that the Department does not properly support the women’s rugby team nor women’s teams generally.
The members, including current team Captain Maya M. Learned ’18 and head coach Suzanne Parker, penned the October letter after attempts to address their concerns with Scalise left them frustrated.
“We talked to Bob Scalise, the Athletic Director, and then we decided that if he wasn’t meeting our needs, we should go straight to his boss,” Learned said.
In an emailed statement, Athletics Department spokesperson Timothy R. Williamson declined to comment on several specific questions for this story.
“While we are unable to comment on personnel matters, we take seriously issues of equity across our athletic teams,” Williamson wrote. “As such, Harvard Athletics periodically takes a deeper look at issues of equity across our programs, and we are currently engaged in that process.”
Not only do the members of the program hold that the Department’s process for addressing their concerns has been unreliable, they question whether Harvard’s Athletics Department complies with anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.
The complaints and meetings have spurred an administrative review of both the women’s rugby program and gender equity in the Athletics Department. What began as a single team’s complaints about the support it receives from the Athletics Department has expanded into a Department-wide review of gender pay equity and a Human Resources review of how the Department responded to the team’s concerns.
FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said last week that the investigations are ongoing.
“We obviously take very seriously these sorts of claims and want to investigate then,” said Smith. “If there are found issues, then, I think we have demonstrated this in the past, we undertake to correct them, and move forward both within the law but also within what we all want to accomplish with gender equity amongst our athletic endeavors.”
The investigations are the latest set of reviews of the Athletics Department as it grapples with a number of complaints about gender and and administrative oversight.
“It is time for transparency and to take action to eradicate discrimination at Harvard and especially in the Athletic Department,” members of the women’s rugby program wrote in an April letter to Faust.
‘Unequal Treatment of Our Program’
On Oct. 4, Learned, Parker, and two former captains sent a letter to Faust, calling for a meeting to discuss “unequal treatment of our program, namely insufficient recruiting support and coaching salaries.”
The women’s rugby team is allotted four recruiting spots per year, a relatively low number that some members of the programs said means that many of the players on the team are walk-ons. Learned said this practice increases the risk of concussions and other injuries.
“You have players who are playing every minute of every game the whole season, which leads to a lot of injuries, or a lot of walk-ons who will come on and play one game and end up with a concussion because they haven’t had enough training time to know how to deal with the contact of rugby,” Learned said.
The letter describes the team’s reliance on postering, tabling in dining halls, and emailing over listservs to field a complete team of at least 15 athletes. At the start of the 2016 pre-season and in the season opener game, the team had 14 healthy players, according to the letter.
Several other members of the women's rugby team declined to comment.
Beyond discussing the number of recruiting spots granted to the women’s rugby team, the authors of the October letter argue that compensation for the rugby program’s coaching staff is not equitable with the salaries for coaches of other field sports.
“Our coaches are paid significantly less than their female counterparts who coach comparable team field sports,” the four authors wrote. “The disparity is even greater when compared to head coaches of men’s team field sports.”
According to statistics from the Department of Education for the 2015-2016 school year, head coaches of female teams made roughly $34,000 less on average than the head coaches of men’s teams. The gap is present between assistant coaches of male and female teams, too:  On average, assistant coaches for women’s sports earned $39,006 compared to $53,983 for assistant coaches for men’s teams.
Parker declined to comment on her salary, though the average salary for the head coach of a women’s team at Harvard is $80,097. The head coaches of men’s teams make, on average, $114,196 a year. Median and individual salaries are not publicly available.
While similar wage gaps between coaches of men’s and women’s teams exist within the majority of institutions in the Ivy League, Parker said in an interview Harvard should look beyond its peers.
“Just because other institutions pay female coaches less than male coaches does not mean it is legal or ethical, and it is definitely not exemplary,” she said. “In fact, choosing to compensate female coaches on that basis merely perpetuates historic discrimination.”
Emails sent over the women’s rugby listserv also describe efforts to bolster the team’s finances through donations from family members of athletes and t-shirt sales.
“Once again, please know that every gift counts and this program can not be successful without every one working together,” Parker wrote in an email to the team.
The October letter had been the result of months of attempted communication and meetings with Scalise and other Athletics Department administrators. In a December email to members of the women’s rugby team, Learned explained the rationale for contacting Faust.
“Over the past year Sue has been engaged in conversations with the athletic department in an attempt to create more equal opportunities for female athletes at Harvard,” Learned wrote. “Unfortunately, these conversations were not successful.”
While the letter did not lead to a meeting with Faust, Learned and Parker met with representatives of Harvard’s office of human resources, which handles matters related to Harvard employees. In a University document obtained by The Crimson, the October letter to Faust was listed as the impetus behind two separate assessments of the department.
In November, Harvard hired Alexandra D. Thaler, an attorney at Bello / Welsh LLP, to conduct an independent review of the alleged “inequitable treatment of the Women’s Varsity Rugby Program relating to staffing and recruiting.” Thaler was also tasked with reviewing how administrators in Athletics Department had responded to Parker’s initial complaints, according to a letter members of the rugby team sent in December.
The complaints also prompted Harvard to hire Janet P. Judge ’85 as an external investigator to review gender and pay equity in the Athletics Department beginning this semester.
“The goal of this letter was to have a conversation about our concerns in regard to the unequal treatment of our team, but also the fact that this is a much larger issue at the school as a whole,” Learned wrote in the December email to the team.
'Devoid of Any Indicia of Objectivity'
Soon after the meetings with Human Resources administrators and the beginning of Thaler’s investigation, though, the same four authors again began raising concerns about the Athletics Department.
In a Dec. 1 letter to Chris Ciotti, Harvard’s associate dean of human resources, and Nina Collins, associate dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Learned, Parker, and two former captains of the team wrote that Thaler’s investigation did not appear to be impartial.
“[W]e lack confidence that the investigation will involve a truthful consideration of the issues, or yield an appropriate result,” they wrote.
In particular, they criticized the way in which investigators had interviewed members of the program, holding meetings with Parker and players separately. They also charged that Judge—who was tasked with reviewing gender and pay equity in the Athletics Department—and Thaler were not sufficiently independent from Harvard.
Thaler previously represented Harvard in a lawsuit in 2013. As an undergraduate, Judge played on the varsity women’s soccer team, which Scalise coached prior to his role as Athletic Director. Judge also served as Assistant Director of Athletics from 1986 to 1990.
“As it stands, your proposed review of our unequal pay claim is devoid of any indicia of objectivity, fairness or gathering of appropriate facts and applying them to the relevant laws,” the authors wrote.
Neither Judge nor Thaler responded to requests for comment.
The authors of the letter also took aim at an “Overview Document” that Harvard had sent summarizing the investigation. According to the letter, Ciotti and Collins articulated a version of the authors’ concerns in a document to the players and coach. The authors wrote that the document’s articulation differed too widely from the issues they had raised both in the previous letter and in the November meeting.
“From our perspective...the issues intended to be raised by us have not been discussed with us or stated accurately for purposes of framing an analysis or investigation,” they wrote.
In the letter, the current and former captains and Parker wrote that they doubted whether Thaler’s investigation could adequately address their complaints.
“Harvard’s and Ms. Thaler’s proposed method of investigating Harvard’s treatment of the Women’s Varsity Rugby Program by interviewing individuals will not lead to a determination of whether Harvard treats the Women’s Varsity Rugby Program in compliance with Title IX,” they wrote.
The team members and head coach also criticize the Athletics Department’s involvement in the review of its own practices regarding gender and pay equity.
“To be clear, neither Bob Scalise nor any administrator in the Athletic Department should have a role in formulating, conducting or reviewing an investigation into the issue raised here, nor should they be part of a group that hears and discusses the findings or makes recommendations,” they wrote. “Harvard’s current proposed process gives the appearance of protecting Bob Scalise and/or Harvard at the expense of a correct and thorough review.”
Williamson declined to comment beyond his initial statement.
‘Intrinsic Culture of Sexism’
In the months that followed, the four authors began to conduct their own informal review of pay and gender equity in Harvard’s Athletics Department. On April 4, they again wrote a letter to Faust with their conclusions, urging Faust to meet with them and address what they called an “intrinsic culture of sexism” in the Athletics Department.
“As we looked into how Harvard allocates resources, especially recruiting targets and financial resources, we found data which revealed that Harvard is not and has not been in compliance with Title IX or Massachusetts pay equity laws,” Parker said in an interview.
Title IX stipulates that all institutions receiving federal funds must provide equal opportunities for men and women. For the Athletics Department at Harvard, this means offering comparable facilities and equipment, administrative support, and recruitment resources to both men’s and women’s teams.
Title IX compliant institutions must also fulfill one of three additional categories, according to the National Collegiate Athletic Association. A school must either have a proportional ratio of male to female athletes, regularly add programs for the underrepresented gender, or otherwise “fully and effectively accommodate the interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex.”
In their letter, the members of the women’s rugby program maintain that Harvard does not meet any of these three categories for gender equity.
“It may appear, superficially, that our Athletic Department is gender equitable, given that 21 varsity sports are offered each to males and females. But the underlying numbers tell a different story,” the authors wrote.
In particular, the authors argue that gender balance in the Athletics Department is not representative of the student body—according to the Department of Education statistics, female student-athletes comprise 41 percent of athletes, while 47 percent of the total student body is female. They also hold that the Department has not consistently elevated women’s teams to varsity status nor proved that it has met the needs of female athletes at the school.
The authors suggest that the Athletics Department’s structure is at the root of the problem. They describe a three tier-system for categorizing varsity teams. According to the letter, in the top tier are the approximately 166 male athletes from the ice hockey, football, and basketball teams, compared to around 43 female athletes from the women’s basketball and ice hockey teams.
To the letter’s authors, this system perpetuates gender inequality “by disproportionately favoring male athletes, especially in the top tier.”
Williamson did not comment on whether the Athletics Department uses a tier-based system to represent and allocate resources to teams, but Faust did respond to Learned about the emailed letter on April 10.
“As you may recall, I asked FAS to look into the concerns raised in your letter to me last fall,” Faust wrote in an email obtained by The Crimson. “I have been advised that that review is ongoing.  I have also made sure that FAS is aware of your most recent communication.”
Almost a month after Faust’s response, Learned said the relatively slow pace and small scope of the administrative response has been frustrating.
“They weren’t addressing what was the most important part, which was the Title IX audit,” said Learned. “Overall, it’s been very frustrating dealing with Harvard administration just because this is such a glaring issue that I deal with everyday and my teammates deal with every day, and any women in athletics deals with every day.”
The HR and Athletics Department gender equity reviews come in the midst of a series of other assessments and discussions about gender and culture in the Harvard Athletics. The department is currently working with a group of consultants from the National Consortium for Academics and Sports to conduct a cultural assessment of the athletics program.
The review follows reports in the fall that revealed that past men’s soccer and men’s cross country teams created documents with sexually explicit comments about female athletes. An Office of General Counsel review revealed that the practice continued among the men’s soccer team up through the 2016 season, leading to the team’s season’s cancellation. Following an OGC review of the men’s cross country team, the Athletic Department put the team on “athletic probation.”
“The behavior of the mens’ soccer and cross-country teams reflect an intrinsic culture of sexism in the Athletic Department,” wrote the current and former captains and Parker in their April 4 letter. “We hope that the consultants hired to address team culture focus on the deeply rooted sexism that taints everyday life for females in that department, and that the resulting report is shared for all to see. We also believe this sexism should be acknowledged and addressed at the highest level of our institution.”
The consultants from NCAS have circulated a survey to student athletes as well as met in working groups with captains, specific teams, and other groups of athletes.
Additionally, Harvard human resources has been leading an assessment of the women’s cross country and track programs after faculty and student-athletes raised concerns about the team’s divided culture and the alleged behavior of distance coach Patrick Wales-Dinan.
Parker is hopeful, though, that Harvard can become a leader in creating a gender-equitable Athletic Department as long as the assessments of athletics culture, Title IX compliance, and pay equity are transparent and lead to action.
“We believe Harvard should be the standard bearer in what a gender-equitable athletic department looks like,” said Parker. “The results of these audits should be transparent so the Harvard community can work together to achieve the goal of gender equity in the Athletics Department now, before another school year goes forward under the current system.”
The women’s rugby team won the Ivy 7 championship for the second year in a row last weekend.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Students across the University will hold the first-ever commencement ceremony for black students on May 23 in an effort to bring black students across schools together and acknowledge challenges that students of color may face at Harvard.
Organized by black students across Harvard’s graduate schools, the event will feature speeches from students, alumni, and administrators. It will also honor  alumni Aaron Bray and Tonika Morgan with the Black Legacy Award for their contributions to black student life. Bray and Morgan graduated from the Law School and Graduate School of Education, respectively, in 2016.
The event, called Black Commencement 2017, has more than 170 student and 530 guest sign-ups so far, according to the Boston Globe. 
Michael Huggins, president of the Harvard Black Graduate Student Alliance, began organizing the event after finishing his first year at the Kennedy School, where he noticed an absence of programming to connect black graduates across disciplines. Huggins completed his bachelor’s degree at Stanford from 2010, where he noted a “long tradition” of similar graduation ceremonies for black alumni.
“I think there’s so many good opportunities to build networks, to build fellowship, to build community,” Huggins said. “This is an opportunity to hear stories that are often not told.”
Kristin A. Turner, president of the Harvard Black Law Students Association, said the event looks to help black students “claim our visibility” at the University, an institution that has historically been majority white.
“We chose Black Commencement as not only a commemoration of all the different dynamics that go into being a person of color at Harvard University, but also a celebration of what an accomplishment it is to not only come out on the other side,” Turner said.
Four students, who will all graduate later this month, were selected to speak at the event and will highlight various parts of the black student experience at Harvard, according to Huggins and Courtney A. Woods, a student at the Graduate School of Education.
Woods said her own speech will discuss “what it means to walk across the stage and symbolically bringing my family, my community.”
The planned ceremony comes as Harvard’s student body becomes increasingly diverse and the University attempts to grapple with its historical ties to slavery.
Organizers of the event said this history often complicated their experiences at Harvard.
“I will be frank and say that of course there have been times where I’ve felt isolated,” Woods said. “But that doesn’t mean that my experience at Harvard is something I don’t want to remember and cherish for the rest of my life.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The email from Computer Science 50: “Introduction to Computer Science I” head instructor David J. Malan ’99 arrived when one CS50 enrollee was sitting in the airport on Jan. 9, waiting to board a flight home for winter break.
Exams had wrapped up almost two weeks earlier on Dec. 20, and she had received her grade in every other class—but the student was still unable to see her final score in CS50. The student emailed course staff on Jan. 6 asking them why her online transcript read “PND,” short for “pending.”
Three days later, Malan responded.
“I’m afraid the PND is the result of some concerns on our part regarding academic honesty that have been referred to the Honor Council,” reads Malan’s email, obtained by The Crimson. “They should be in touch soon, but allow me to loop in your resident dean, cc’d, in the meantime for counsel.”
The student—granted anonymity by The Crimson because she did not want her name associated with cheating accusations—was one of over 60 CS50 enrollees who appeared before the Honor Council to face allegations of academic dishonesty in a wave of cheating first reported by The Crimson last week.
It would be almost six weeks before the student received the Honor Council’s final judgment—a “scratch,” meaning she was cleared of all charges—on Feb. 13.
The Honor Council sends a document to students accused of academic dishonesty promising to “conclude [its] review quickly.” But three students who took CS50 and faced the Honor Council this semester described a disciplinary process that lasted weeks and sometimes months.
These students and former Honor Council member Matthew J. Vegari ’17 said Malan’s method of checking for cheating caused the CS50 Honor Council cases to take longer than usual. Malan did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Malan does not check for cheating until near the end of the fall semester, when he runs an algorithm that flags potential plagiarism, according to five current and former CS50 staffers. He then reviews and sends possible academic dishonesty cases to the Honor Council, the roughly 30-person administrative body that adjudicates such cases at the College.
The sudden rush of CS50 cases placed a heavy burden on the Honor Council over the past few months, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of the investigations. The Honor Council continued to hear CS50 cases until at least late February, according to two CS50 students who appeared before the Council.
Vegari, who served on the Honor Council from 2015 to 2016, said the amount of time required to resolve some CS50 students’ cases was “unusual.”
Vegari said last semester’s CS50 cheating cases likely took longer because Malan reported the cheating to the Honor Council at the end of the semester. He added that, during his tenure on the Honor Council, no other Harvard professor checked and reported academic dishonesty cases as one batch late in the year, as Malan does.
“I found it very unfair to the students and it was unfair to the Honor Council and the administrative staff,” Vegari said of Malan’s approach.
Two CS50 students who appeared before the Honor Council said the late timing of their cases exacerbated an already stressful situation.
“Malan choosing to wait until the end of the class… just puts everybody in a bad situation, nobody wants to be in that situation,” one student said.
Mark D. Grozen-Smith ’15, a former CS50 teaching fellow, said he also finds Malan’s procedure of checking for cheating worrisome, though he said he thought the situation poses a “hard problem.”
“It does concern me, the point of checking only at the end,” Grozen-Smith said.
Four other course staffers, who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak to the press about the class, said they were similarly troubled by Malan’s approach to finding cases of academic dishonesty.
Vegari said he found Malan’s methods especially frustrating because he thinks the problem has an easy fix.
“I don’t know if he’s made plans to correct it, but clearly there is a way of correcting it, which is, just run the algorithm earlier,” Vegari said. “It’s not like they don’t get the students’ code until the end of term, they get it week by week and then they just kind of compile it and then they run it all at the end of term.”
“The point is, there is an obvious solution, it’s not like there’s no way to fix this,” Vegari added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over $300,000 in prize money was awarded to seven winners of the President’s Innovation Challenge Award Ceremony at the iLab in Allston on Tuesday afternoon.
First held in 2012, the Innovation Challenge invites students across Harvard’s schools to submit ideas to solve “issues facing the world.” Over 400 students from Harvard’s thirteen schools made a declaration of interest last fall, ultimately producing 200 proposals. From those proposals, 15 were selected by a committee of over 150 judges to compete for the final prize.
“It’s always such an amazingly wonderful and exciting moment for us here at the iLab because the challenge gets to the core of who we are and what we are,” Jodi Goldstein, the managing director of the Harvard Innovations Lab, said.
After Goldstein’s opening remarks, each of the 15 teams gave a one-minute pitch about their start-up. School of Public Health student Anushka Mangharam said she enjoyed hearing from the various finalists.
“It is fascinating for us to hear about things like [Jane Diagnostics], which is promoting a pregnancy type-test for cervical cancer, because it’s such a barrier for women to get screened for cervical cancer,” Mangharam said.
After the pitches, University President Drew G. Faust announced the winners and the runners-up of the Challenge. Lightmatter, UrSure Inc., and Upsolve were named grand prize winners of $75,000 in their respective categories. AirCrew, C16, and Jane Diagnostics took home runner-up prizes, each receiving $25,000.
Two Rabbits, a startup focused on providing early childhood education via low-cost mp3 technology took home the “crowd-favorite” award of $10,000.
Rohan N. Pavuluri ’18, co-founder of Upsolve, a startup which seeks to provide bankruptcy advice to low-income Americans, said that while the prize winnings were certainly helpful, they were not how he measured his project’s progress.
“Funding is never a milestone of success, it is just something that keeps us doing our work. So this an opportunity that we see for us to continue our work and our mission,” Pavuluri said.
Pavuluri said he and co-founder Milton M. Syed ’18 plan to use the Innovation Challenge funding to start serving communities in the Bay Area.
“I am most excited about taking this opportunity across the country, taking something that was a dorm room idea, not more than a year ago to turn it into a national nonprofit,” Syed said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Roughly 84 percent of students invited to join the Class of 2021 accepted their offer, a marked uptick from the Class of 2020’s 80 percent yield for admitted students rate last year.
“It was the largest number of applications in our history, it was a great yield on admitted students. Everything we could possibly hope for happened in this class,” Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 said.
Nearly 40,000 students applied to Harvard’s Class of 2021 this cycle, and 2,056 were admitted to the College in March—a 5.2 percent acceptance rate.
A press release credited a variety of factors in attracting the students to Harvard in recent years, including new arts programs, updated engineering and science facilities, and the “One Harvard” concept, in which the resources of Harvard’s graduate schools are integrated into the undergraduate experience.
“We made a big change on the financial aid program now over 10 years ago. I said at the time you will see the effect of this over time,” Fitzsimmons said, “I would say this might have been one of those year when things combine and maybe this is a jump up to a new level.”
According to the press release, the incoming freshman class is more socioeconomically diverse than in previous years: Of the two-thirds of the incoming class that applied for financial aid, approximately 24 percent were classified as low-income and 17 percent were eligible for Pell Grants.
Additionally, 15 percent of students accepting admission will be the first from their family to attend college. After rejecting a proposal for a summer program for low-income and first generation students, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced that he planned to appoint a “student advocate” to assist those students.
For the Class of 2021, the Office of Financial Aid plans to continue its start-up grants, which were first offered to the Class of 2020. The grants will provide students from families earning under $65,000 per year with $2,000 to assist in the transition to college.
Despite uncertainty over President Donald J. Trump’s immigration policies, the incoming class will be composed of 12.3 percent foreign passport holders, up from 11.7 for the Class of 2020. Canadian students will make up 2.0 percent of the incoming class.
Within the United States, students from the Mid-Atlantic comprise 21.9 percent of the incoming class, while students from New England will make up 17.2 percent. 18.2 percent of the Class of 2021 will hail from the South, 14.2 percent from the Pacific, and 15.9 from the Midwest, Central, or Mountain regions.
As a lawsuit accusing Harvard of discrimination against Asian-American applicants continues, Asian Americans comprise 21.7 percent of the incoming class, marginally down from a record high last year. Overall, the racial diversity of the Class of 2021 slightly increased, Director of Admissions Marlyn E. McGrath said in the press release—a record 13.2 percent of students self-identified as African-American. Additionally, Latino, Native American, and Native Hawaiian students represent 10.8, 1.6, and 0.5 percent of the Class of 2021, respectively.
According to the press release, the academic interests of the incoming class are similar to those of previous classes, with an increased interest in the social sciences.
“I think one of the thing Harvard has tried very hard to do over the past 10 or 20 years is to remain a very balanced institution,” Fitzsimmons said. “Our students today are very savvy about what it is that they are going to do.”
Approaching gender parity, women comprise 49.6 percent of the incoming class, up from 47.8 percent in the Class of 2020.
The College’s policy penalizing members of single-gender final clubs, sororities, and fraternities is set to go into effect with the Class of 2021.
In part due to the high yield, Fitzsimmons believes it is “highly unlikely” that any students will be admitted from the waitlist.
“The class is full at this point,” Fitzsimmons said. “As far as we can see, we’re not going to be admitting people off the waitlist for August.”
