After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A lot can probably be said about the social relationship between Lady Gaga and Roxie Hart, star murderess of “Chicago.” But last week's production of the 1975 Kander and Ebb musical did not even begin to say it—despite proclaimed aspirations to “inject [Gaga’s] aesthetic”—her “stage histrionics and meta-performance”—back into theater. The effort possessed all the energy and grace of someone constructing a last-minute themed-party costume (one usher took the attitude to an extreme with his sloppy, bubble-wrap toga).
Despite (or perhaps because of) its lack of Gaga-inspired theatricality, the show—centered on a murderess hoping to beat justice through the power of celebrity—still finished its three-night run on Wednesday having, at the very least, entertained its audience. Director Brandon J. Ortiz ’12 left the original Prohibition-era music and lyrics unchanged, and it is their beautiful execution that carried the show, the first student production to be staged in the American Repertory Theater’s Club Oberon.
Once known as the Zero Arrow Theater, Club Oberon announced itself over a year ago as a venue for dynamic theater and the home of “The Donkey Show,” a Studio 54-inspired retelling of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” Every weekend the energy of that performance pours out into the street in the form of lame-clad rollerbladers; for this performance, supplementary actors known as “Billy’s Girls” and “Roxie’s Boys” tried to channel some of this pre-show vigor. Ladies in outfits that look like they were shoplifted from Hot Topic’s baby punk section and guys in shiny, red leotards (one in striped boxer briefs) danced and spread through the audience, while “I Got Rhythm” was carried out by Music Director Mark R. Parker ’12 and the band. Apparently instructed to engage-through-flirtation, the Boys and Girls demonstrated that this was a skill yet to be mastered, coming off more awkward than alluring.
The signature “razzle dazzle” of “Chicago” had been subdued by its lack of set and limited number of props (the greatest ooos and ahs were teased out by tricks from an Intro-to-Magic kit), but the leads’ voices,with the superb accompaniment of Parker's band, helped disguise this deficiency. Madison A. Greer '13 made a captivating Roxie Hart; with a giggle as melodic as her singing, it became difficult to detest the irritating character she portrayed, even while her “funny hubby” Amos (Ryan P. Halprin '12, who also choreographed the production) drew the audience’s sympathy with his despairing rendition of “Mr. Cellophane.” And though the sometimes twangy croon of jail warden Mama (Brianne Holland-Stergar ’13) seemed out of place against her leather outfit and punk-inspired braided hair, the high-energy craziness of her character was perhaps the show’s most successful creative liberty. Unfortunately, such innovation was not extended to Roxie’s jailhouse rival Velma Kelly (Megan E. O’ Keefe '11) and their sly lawyer Billy Flynn (Alex Nemiroski). Though equally impressive in talent, Velma and Billy were undermined by the simplicity of their get-ups. Her pink leotard and high, tight ponytail were not imaginative. His smirk seemed to carry the whole weight of the theatrical ringmaster attitude his pink shirt was intended to convey.
Not all of the show’s costumes were underwhelming, though. The other ladies of Crookem County Jail were, for the most part, cleverly attired. The Bazooka gum-themed frock on "Pop" (Nikki Kapu '14), who fired two “warning shots” into the skull of her gum-smacking guy, was particularly amusing, as was the artist's frock dress on the lady of "Lipschitz" (Elise Kuo). The gun-wielding brassiere of the heiress turned murderess was a suitable appropriation from Gaga’s eclectic wardrobe. And the emcee for the evening (Jessica Means ’09) channeled some Gaga-glam in a bright pink, sequined blazer over a sparkly silver bra top, though that pizzazz was sabotaged by her tendency to look alternately bored, worried, or scared.
Occasional Bad Romance-type Thriller claw movements and a wheelchair cameo stood in for Lady-like dance numbers; otherwise the choreography was well executed albeit safe and not particularly “radical,” as was claimed. Still, the aerial silk dance done to illustrate the hanging of the innocent “Uh Oh” (Marin Orlosky Randow ’07) was a welcome touch, as was the cheaply humorous pantomime (delivered by two of Roxie’s Boys) of the Amos’s robotic lovemaking as it compared to the apparently more dynamic Fred Casely (Matthew J. Devino ’13).
So, this was, for better or worse, “a whole new Chicago.” It inexplicably traded the over-the-top glitz of fame for a minimalistic approach to the contemporary, immersive theater experience, but that trade didn’t need to be made. As a lead-up to the number “Class,” Velma expresses frustration after Roxie steals her court appearance dramatics, and Mama replies, “Well, what do you expect?...The world’s gone lowbrow!” For a production that is supposedly inspired by “contemporary high fashion and postmodern performance art,” the answer to the same question would simply be, “More.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: December 13, 2010
An earlier version of the Dec. 13 arts article "'Chicago' Sets Expectations Too High" incorrectly reported that "Chicago" was an HRDC production. In fact, the show was produced independently.

Recently, the Motion Picture Association of America began sending thousands of letters to colleges and universities across the country, reminding them of their obligation to set up a "written plan to effectively combat the unauthorized distribution of copyright material by users of the institution's network" under the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008. Because we believe that intellectual property rights are important and the unauthorized downloading of copyrighted music, movies, and television programs is wrong, we applaud this move and hope that universities abide by the guidelines set down in the HEOA.
Our support for the MPAA’s actions is based on our belief that the unauthorized downloading of music, movies, and television programs, although easy, is questionable at the most basic level. In our postindustrial economy, the protection of intellectual property rights is important for several reasons. First, these rights must be safeguarded in order to provide an incentive for innovation. Without any guarantee of legitimacy, entrepreneurs will have no motivation to create new intellectual property, as it could be stolen at any time. Second, at a broader level, intellectual property rights are important because each person has a fundamental right to enjoy the fruits of his or her mental labor. Intellectual entrepreneurship requires a broad societal commitment to the rule of law and the importance of private enterprise.
This approach strikes the right balance between targeting individuals—who, in the end, are ultimately responsible for their online behavior—and universities, who provide the network resources that can be used to facilitate copyright violations. To that end, we hope that universities, rather than the MPAA's legal team, can serve a valuable role as an enforcer of sorts, by keeping chronic infringers off of their networks. In particular, we are concerned with the role of prolific "uploaders" who host and share thousands or millions of unauthorized copies of copyrighted content through online peer-to-peer networks and Usenet.
At a local level, we commend Harvard's Office of General Counsel for taking proactive measures to remain in compliance with the relevant federal legislation, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and the HEOA. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ “three strikes and you're out”  policy regarding network access for repeat infringers is firm but fair, keeping repeat offenders off of the network while maintaining access for the vast majority of students. We are especially appreciative of the fact that this policy does not concern other College disciplinary bodies, as copyright infringement is a totally separate issue from student behavior or academic dishonesty.
Finally, more broadly speaking, we are excited by the move made by the entertainment industry as a whole toward embracing the Internet space. The provision of legal streaming media on websites like Hulu, Pandora, and Netflix all but eliminates the excuses of media pirates, who have argued for years that the entertainment industry is attempting to impose an outdated business model through obtrusive litigation. Although these moves are encouraging, however, we still see numerous opportunities for Internet Protocol-rights holders to expand in the Internet space, particularly in sports programming and back-catalogue access to popular television programs.
In the end, of course, the key to this entire approach will be its implementation. The onus is now on the universities in question to create an effective and transparent system that remains in compliance with relevant federal legislation. For our part, we welcome these changes to the law and hope that both the MPAA and the affected universities will work together to eliminate online piracy, replacing it with a new business model that wholeheartedly embraces the Internet through the provision of authorized online content.

“Wow, Look at those Christmas lights!” my sister exclaims on Thanksgiving weekend as our family drives by the one house on the street that sheds some light over our dark, lifeless suburb. Sadly, my mom concedes we won’t have time to put up lights this weekend as my Dad chimes in that when he was a kid every family on the street would have their lights up by now. “Why does no one have time to put up their Christmas lights anymore?” I wonder, for just a second, then I remember my essay due Monday and check my iPhone for updates on my Chinese project, and I forget about the Christmas lights, too, as my holiday spirit is trumped once again by my ever-pervasive work.
In Charles Dickens’s timeless cautionary tale, “A Christmas Carol,” Ebenezer Scrooge is villainized for selfishly wanting to work on Christmas. But are we now really all that much different from the Scrooge, who we promised ourselves we would never become? Take a moment to ask yourself: On your Thanksgiving break, did you bring work home, and did you spend time doing that work instead of spending time with family and friends, or decorating your house with Christmas lights? For most of us the answer is a guilty “yes.” And it is our “always-on” workaholic attitude bolstered by the digital age that is responsible for us losing our way.
It is notables that now, 56 percent of American adults can access the Internet wirelessly via mobile devices, signaling a new American age of enabled “workaholism.” With smartphones and laptops now ubiquitous, everyone can be on call at all times, in all places, resulting in a turnaround time for work that approaches instantaneous. In the digital age, we have all built mobile workplaces around ourselves, blurring the once sacred line between our working lives and family lives. This disturbing development became immediately clear to me when after Thanksgiving dinner my aunt took an odd snapshot of my family: We were all around the kitchen table watching a movie out of the corner of our eyes, but in actuality, we were each hard at work on our respective laptops!
Not even Dickens would have imagined an image so perverse and counter to the holiday spirit in his time, yet this is now commonplace in our society, where if not on laptops we are impatiently checking email on our phones instead of devoting full attention to the holiday at hand. Although we are no longer physically forced to go to work on holidays, we don’t seem to be able to leave work mentally either, and in doing so, we merely circumvent the warning Dickens desperately tried to tell.
“A Christmas Carol,” set in the time of the Industrial Revolution over 160 years ago, cautions against an obsession with money and work over true values like family and love. But, ironically, by surrounding ourselves with technology, we seem to have regressed back to those bleak times. It is not a matter of more work these days; our parents’ generation could make time for the holidays, despite similar work commitments. Their healthier spirit came with a stricter adherence to tradition and family values that our generation seems to have lost along the way. Let’s learn from our Christmas past (or Thanksgiving past, for that matter) and realize that there is a time for work but more importantly, a time to completely forget about that work, shut down our laptops, stash our iPhones, and just put up Christmas lights.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Israeli academics, having led the way in the fields of biomedical, semiconductor, and weapons technologies, have much to provide the world.
However, the ensuing conflict between Israel and Palestine has impeded this development. The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign against Israel has been an extremely contentious issue on campuses around the world. Its supporters see the campaign as an effective means of pressuring Israel to uphold international law. On the other hand, its critics see it as rife with double standards and as a counterproductive approach to resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict.
Attempting to censor and silence the dialogue is never the answer. Only an open exchange of ideas from all academics will lead to a true understanding and, ultimately, a resolution. There is always hope in education.
Boycotts of researchers or research institutions contravene the purpose of academia, which is deeply rooted on the freedom of inquiry and freedom of speech.
Recently, I coproduced an interview with Noam Chomsky for TVOntario, in which he discussed the Middle East, America’s foreign policy, and the BDS campaign. In that interview, when asked if he supported BDS, Chomsky stated that he is unconvinced of the tactic.
“I would not support an academic boycott. I did not even support them on South Africa, apart from specific racist practices, like hiring,” said Chomsky.
In correspondences with Chomsky, he elucidated his stance on the issue, “I have always been skeptical about academic boycotts. There may be overriding reasons, but in general I think that those channels should be kept open.”
Supporters of the academic boycott argue that Israeli academics cannot exempt themselves from a boycott on the grounds of academic freedom while they fail to speak up for the academic freedom of Palestinians. To this I say, it does not make it right to censor an academic just because they do not shed light to the Palestinian plight. It truly is unfortunate that Palestinians are denied education, and I wish we could change that, but students in many places are denied education. And if we boycott Israel it does not end there. Why not boycott the whole world? Simply because you cannot. Why, then, should the Palestinian cause be more important?
Chomsky has been directly connected to BDS from its roots, signing a controversial Harvard-MIT petition in 2002, which he agreed with in principle. It called for making U.S. government aid conditional on dismantling settlements, the divestment of Harvard and MIT assets from U.S. companies that sell weapons to Israel, and the divestment from Israel all together. However, Chomsky was against the last tactic, which called for divestment from Israel.
“There's not much to say. I've been involved in BDS activities since long before the term was invented. It's a tactic, not a principle. Like any tactic, one has to evaluate particular proposals. Some are fine, some counterproductive,” stated Chomsky.
Former Harvard University president and Director of the National Economic Council Lawrence H. Summers’s sentiment regarding the academic boycott of Israel was resounding, “I found it shocking and deeply troubling that a substantial group of faculty members at major universities would propose seriously, and indeed seek to pressure, for universities like Harvard to sell, to divest, any stock, any company that did any business with Israel. It seemed to me that such a boycott that singled out Israel was profoundly misguided.”
When asked about boycotts in general, Chomsky asked, “Why boycott Israel and not boycott the United States? The U.S. has a much worse record. Apart from Israel, the United States is by far the world’s major arm supplier.”
In specific to academic boycotts, Chomsky iterated that, “Harvard University has always been deeply implicated in implementing U.S. foreign policy, from providing the leading personnel for major war crimes (Bundy, Kissinger, etc.) to the activities carried out in the [Kennedy] Government School, and much else. These vastly exceed University of Tel Aviv’s contributions to war crimes – quite apart from the fact that Israeli crimes are in fact US crimes, a tiny fraction of them.”
“Bundy and Kissinger are two of the major war criminals of the modern era. There is a long list of others. The [Kennedy] Government School is utterly outlandish. Among its more ‘benign’ activities is having the head of the [Carr] Human Rights Center, [Sarah Sewell], write the introduction for David Petraeus’s famous [military] counterinsurgency manual.”
Universities are probably the least malign of all the actors in this conflict. “If we want to boycott those directly involved in atrocities let us go after the corporate system, the governments, and the citizens who pay taxes, etc.,” said Chomsky
“Academic institutions are among the least of the participants, and they offer some of the best hope for confronting these crimes. However, they’re not above the fray by any means.”
Chomsky, one of the many staunch supporters of Palestine is still fighting, having turned 82 today. When asked if the fire still burns inside of him at his age, he responded with a resounding yes.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of the Nov. 15 comment "Living At Gunpoint" referred to "semi-automatic machine guns" and implied that they are legal to purchase in the United States. In fact, the term semi-automatic machine gun is incorrect; semi-automatic rifles are legal to purchase. The Crimson regrets the error.

In July 2009, President Barack H. Obama announced the program that has become his signature contribution to education policy: the Race to the Top initiative. Through this initiative, states were able to fill out applications that demonstrated their commitment to national education standards, and the highest-scoring states were granted a share of federal funds. Ultimately, programs like Race to the Top represent the best means of achieving educational advancement in the United States, and competitive grants should be used more frequently in fostering progress. Nonetheless, a number of changes can improve this already effective program in its future incarnations.
First, Race to the Top reflects President Obama’s focus on the right means of improving education nationwide. Studies have consistently shown that teacher effectiveness represents one of the best indicators of classroom performance, and the most extensive component of the Race to the Top application asked states about their plans for improving teacher quality. At the same time, Obama’s initiative did not ignore the difficulty of evaluating teacher performance; another lengthy section of the application asked states about their plans for developing assessments that accurately test students’ knowledge. This focus on teacher quality coupled with assessment methods represents the two-pronged approach that should be adopted in facing America’s education crisis.
Nonetheless, seven civil rights organizations have criticized Race to the Top by arguing, “If education is a civil right, children in ‘winning’ states should not be the only ones who have the opportunity to learn in high-quality environments.” According to these organizations, the government should adopt “conditional incentive grants” that award money to all states that achieve desired educational standards. One problem with this approach is that it hasn’t worked; 80 percent of the funding programs employed by the Department of Education are conditional incentive grants, and they haven’t persuaded states to implement the reforms desired by federal officials. But for whatever reason, the competitive model adopted by Race to the Top convinced 48 states to apply for the grant and implement the proposed changes.
In addition, competitive grants encourage states to adopt reforms without requiring additional federal expenditures. States make reforms simply to improve their application (as they did in Race to the Top), which prevents the national government from distributing its already short supply of money to any state that has adopted even the bare minimum required for a conditional grant. This gives rise to another significant benefit of competitive grants: States are encouraged to adopt reforms that go above and beyond the threshold requirements, since their goal is not just to meet minimum standards that guarantee federal funding but to develop more impressive plans than competing states.
One problem with Race to the Top relates to its imposition of federally supported reforms on locally administered school districts. For example, Texas Governor James R. “Rick” Perry refused to submit an application to Race to the Top, arguing that Texas had already developed innovative reforms to respond to unique statewide conditions; subjecting these reforms to uniform federal standards would thus prevent local experimentation in finding the most effective means of improvement. But the great strength of Obama’s program is that it allows Perry and other governors to make decisions like his refusal to apply; it doesn’t impose federal standards but incentivizes them. Race to the Top is particularly beneficial for underperforming states that have consistently low educational requirements; national standards and incentives represent the best means of bringing these states up to higher levels, since “local experimentation” has historically failed to do so.
But Perry is right to note that federal standards sometimes fail to account for high-performing districts that have not followed the federal guidelines in achieving their success. The other governor who refused to apply for funding—Governor Robert F. “Bob” McDonnell of Virginia—wrote a letter to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan ’87, which stated, “Virginia’s standards actually exceed those [required by Race to the Top] in most areas, and to be competitive for a [Race to the Top] grant under the current rules, we would have to lower our standards.” The rules for Race to the Top specifically discourage states from devoting more than 15 percent of their application to reforms that go beyond the “common standards” outlined by federal officials. Limits like this 15 percent rule directly discourage innovation, for which states should be rewarded rather than penalized.
The Race to the Top grant does little if its use of federal standards to improve underperforming schools comes at the expense of lower standards for the nation’s best schools. In the future, applications should be evaluated on a more discretionary scale that encourages innovation and values school districts that have achieved successful results, even if those districts have used methods that diverge from the federal standards. One of the consistent trends of America’s public school crisis is that it fails its best and its brightest—its best teachers, its best students, and its best schools. Unless the Race to the Top program begins to reverse this trend, it is unlikely to provide the answer to the nation’s most pressing educational challenges.

A cholera strain that has killed more than 2,000 people in Haiti since October is South Asian in origin, according to a study conducted by several Harvard affiliates, who matched bacteria samples from Haiti with ones from Bangladesh.
“Our main finding suggests, but does not prove, that the Haitian strain was introduced by some type of human activity from South Asia,” said Matthew K. Waldor, who organized the study and is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, as well as an attending physician in infectious diseases at Harvard-affiliate Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
The cholera outbreak has spread to all provinces in Haiti, affecting approximately 80,000 people.
The results of the study appear to disprove the idea that the strain originated from the cholera epidemic in Peru in the early 1990s and was carried by ocean currents, which the scientists said had been one possible explanation.
Waldor’s lab conducted comparative genomics work on genomes from Haiti, Bangladesh, and Peru to conclude that the Haitian strain was similar to those circulating in South Asia and not similar to those in Latin America.
“The results show how infectious diseases can spread by global human travel and commerce,” Waldor said.
In order to sequence the genomes, Waldor collaborated with Pacific Biosciences, a biotechnology company in California.
The company is currently working on producing disease maps that sequence disease strains for large geographic regions to examine the origins of pathogens and the routes they take, according to the company’s Chief Scientific Officer Eric E. Schadt.
“When [Waldor] called, his study fit squarely in that type of project. Our technology is suited for sequencing genomes very quickly, whether for preventing an outbreak or treating patients,” Schadt said.
“There’s another technological implication that this newer [sequencing] technology that is ever better and faster and will transform the way we understand the spread of infectious diseases,” Waldor said.
Yet even before the study was conducted, Haitians had reportedly been blaming the Nepali people from the U.N. peacekeeping force for bringing in the cholera strain, according to Joia Mukherjee, the chief medical director at Partners in Health—a Harvard-affiliated non-governmental organization working in Haiti—and an associate professor of medicine at HMS.
The study only confirms those suspicions, Mukherjee said, adding that it is more important to change how peacekeeping is conducted.
“Some people say that aid workers should be vaccinated to protect themselves, but I think people going to [Haiti] should be vaccinated to protect the populace,” Mukherjee said.

In honor of this year’s Human Rights Day, the Institute of Politics and Carr Center for Human Rights Policy spread awareness of the 1915-1923 Armenian genocide in Turkey by hosting a screening of the documentary Aghet: Nation Murder and a discussion on how international relations have prevented wider recognition of the incident.
Aghet, which is Armenian for “genocide,” featured never-before-seen footage that was released to the public after 90 years in German archives.
German-Australian director Eric Friedler, who was on the panel that spoke after the screening, produced the film with these firsthand accounts, along with footage of modern events related to the genocide.
The discussion, featuring Friedler, Executive Director of the Carr Center Charlie Clements, and President of the Syriac League of Lebanon Habib Afram, focused on the genocide’s recognition in the world.
Though the systematic deportation and extermination of 1.5 million Armenians in Turkey incited the first use of the term “genocide,” it has only garnered recognition from 21 nations around the world, including Germany, according to the Armenian National Institute.
The response of Germany, which was allied with Turkey during World War I, was integral to the incident, according to Friedler. German diplomats and volunteers in Turkey during the time documented the horrors of the genocide despite their country’s political alliance with Turkey.
Response to the film has been positive in Germany, Friedler said, although audiences “were a little bit shocked [that the German people] were involved in another genocide too.”
In Turkey, the film is currently screened in private homes, and Friedler said it is “being given away like a pornographic movie, under the table.”
Audience member Noubar Afeyan, a venture capitalist in Boston whose Armenian relatives were saved from the genocide by Germans in Turkey, said the new documentary, despite its century-old subject matter, was appropriate for Human Rights Day.
“It rarely gets coverage,” he said.
The genocide, he explained, relates to other human rights issues such as China’s denial of Liu Xiaobo’s Nobel Peace Prize this year.
“They all interweave,” Afeyan said, adding that the issue is relevant today because Turkey currently serves as the sole Middle Eastern ally of the West, and the film insinuated that the United States is too afraid to venture into demanding proper recognition. Turkey, the film stated, is “too strategically important to risk upsetting.”
A segment in the film featuring former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice stating that it was improper for the United States to take a stance prompted laughter, booing, and hissing from the 200-member audience, many of who were of Armenian descent.

People have the tendency to classify those of biracial descent as members of their minority parent group rather than as equal members of both races, according to a recent study published by Harvard psychologists.
The study, led by Harvard psychology graduate student Arnold K. Ho and co-authored by Harvard Professors James Sidanius and Mahzarin R. Banaji and Vanderbilt Professor Daniel T. Levin, employed computer generated faces of varying ethnicities and fictional family trees to test people’s intuitive racial classifications.
Study results suggest that participants classified half-white and half-minority persons as part of a minority. Researchers used computer generated faces of varying ethnicities and fictional family trees to test people’s preferences.
Participants were also more likely to perceive people who were part black as black than they perceived those who were partially Asian as Asian. Additionally, these participants categorized more male faces as part of a minority than they did female faces.
This research supports the theory of hypodescent, also known as the “one-drop” rule, which states that when a child is born from parents in different racial groups, the child is more often perceived as a member of the race that is considered inferior or less advantaged.
Ho said that while the United States is becoming more racially integrated, it does so on top of the centuries-old “one-drop” rule. As recently as 1985, a Louisiana Court ruled that the great-great-great-great granddaughter of a black woman could not identify herself as “white” on her passport.
Ho said that he was inspired to investigate perceptions of biracials after a conversation he had with a political psychologist about “black exceptionalism,” a theory that argues Latinos and Asians will be fully assimilated into America while African Americans still be perceived as part of a minority group.
“I was uncomfortable with that thesis because I felt that that’s basically saying that there will be no barriers for assimilation of all non-black ethnic groups,” Ho said.
“There’s no doubt that the social distance between racial groups has declined in the last half century,” Ho added. “But what our data revealed is that our perception of biracial may be one mechanism by which racial boundaries are still preserved.”

Over a hundred Harvard undergraduates took a break from studying for half an hour last night, ditching their books and their clothes for a run around the Yard in a tradition known as “Primal Scream.”
The students braved heavy rain and wind to streak around the Yard in commemoration of the first day of exams, which begin at 9 a.m. today.
The crowd of naked runners featured a man wearing a gift box around his crotch, two students riding a tandem bike, and female students sporting rock-climbing attire.
Michael J. Graham ’10, a super-senior in Currier, had his body painted bright green in honor of his house for his last primal scream.
“The rain acts like a shower—it cools you off as you are running,” Graham said, as the green paint dripped off his body.
The temperature, which was in the low 50s, was unusually high. Last winter, primal scream took place in the midst of flurries.
Nicholas E. Scheidler ’13, who participated last December, decided to come to the Yard to cheer on his friends.
“I feel like I did my duty, so this year I’m watching,” he said.
Other onlookers, however, were not from Harvard College.
Marty Laboytton, who hails from New Orleans, was visiting his niece in the area when he came across a horde of naked students.
“It’s like a parade in New Orleans,” he said, adding that he probably would have taken part in a similar activity when he was in college.
Just as in previous years, the Harvard University Band performed in front of the statue of John Harvard.
At ten past midnight, the band headed over to Lamont Library, where its members launched into a loud rendition of “Ten Thousand Men of Harvard.”
“Shh…it’s a library!” the band members whispered after their impromptu performance.
Primal Scream allegedly dates back to the 1960s, when students used to scream from their dormitory windows for 10 minutes straight the night before final exams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A Harvard Business School student was the victim of an unarmed robbery at around 8:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a Harvard University Police advisory sent to the Harvard community yesterday.
When returning to his residence at the Business School after having dinner and grocery shopping in Harvard Square, Yongqing Lin was attacked by two unarmed men behind Hamilton Hall, according to an e-mail that Lin sent to his friends.
Lin said that men grabbed and wrestled him to the ground. While one pressed him down and said “Give me your money,” the other removed Lin’s wallet from the back pocket of his jeans. The suspects then fled across the JFK bridge toward Cambridge, according to the police report and Lin’s e-mail.
Lin said that he immediately reported the incident to Business School security in Aldrich Hall and filed a report with HUPD, though he was unable to identify either of the two robbers. Lin said that he did not get injured in the incident, which lasted about 20 seconds.
“I am completely fine, both physically and mentally,” Lin wrote.
Lin’s friend eventually found his wallet—emptied of all cash and cards—at the Cambridge side of the JFK bridge, according to Lin.
The victim said that he was later contacted about the incident by Barbara A. Siegfriedt, co-director of MBA Student and Academic Services, and Youngme E. Moon, a professor at the Business School.
In his e-mail, Lin advised his friends against taking the path outside Hamilton and carrying grocery bags when walking alone.
The recent incident is the second robbery that has occurred in the month of December, and the eleventh robbery in the Harvard area since Nov. 1. Six of the 11 crimes—including the most recent one—have involved Harvard affiliates, and another group of six were committed by armed suspects.
Prior to Lin’s run-in with the robbers, a graduate student had his cell phone stolen by two unarmed black males near the Cambridge Center for Adult Education last Tuesday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED 9:51 p.m.
After conducting an investigation in response to a recent police report that 36 books treating LGBT topics  had been damaged with what appeared to be urine in Lamont Library last  month, the University determined Monday morning that the incident was an accident and will no longer be treated as a hate crime,  according to a statement sent from College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds to the Harvard community on Monday.
On  November 24, library staff at Lamont discovered the damaged books—on subjects  including lesbian and gay issues and same-sex marriage—along with a bottle assumed to have contained what investigators believed to be urine. This past Friday, library personnel reported the  incident to the College and Harvard University Police Department as  vandalism, and the affair was subsequently investigated as a hate crime  for the "focused nature and related topics" of the affected books,  according to Hammonds.
But upon an  investigation by HUPD, it was revealed Monday morning that "our own  library personnel" had accidentally spilled a bottle, containing what was reported to  be urine, that had been found on the shelf, according to Hammonds.  Harvard College Library plans to replace all 36 damaged books as soon as  possible, she added.
"I believe this is an important new fact in the investigation and warrants my sharing it with you immediately. While we should not minimize the seriousness of this incident, HUPD is no longer classifying this incident as a hate crime," Hammonds wrote in her statement. "This nuance in the facts in the case also explains why library personnel did not immediately report the incident and treated it instead as a prank."
Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesman Jeff Neal wrote in an e-mail that it remains unclear why a bottle of urine was stowed in the library, adding that the spill was reported by the library  employee—the same person who caused the spill, according to his  understanding—and cleaned up the same day that it occurred.
In  response to the initial appearance of the incident as an act of  homophobia, Neal reiterated the significance of an inclusive and diverse  community as highlighted in Hammonds’ statement.
“Dean Hammonds has  repeatedly emphasized the importance of creating a welcoming environment  for all students and all affiliates of all backgrounds throughout the  Harvard community,” Neal wrote, adding that sexual orientation and gender  identity are included in Harvard’s non-discrimination statement.
Harvard College Library spokeswoman Beth S. Brainard declined to   comment, referring all questions regarding the incident to Neal.
Though Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan '11 expressed relief that the damage was the result of an accident and not a targeted act of homophobia, he said that he remained concerned by facts of the incident that remain unexplained.
"On the one hand, I feel relieved by the news—but on the other hand, I’m still holding breath on questions that are still unresolved," Chan said. "Why was there a bottle of urine on the shelf? Why did it take two weeks for library or HUPD to figure out that this was just an accident? Did someone suddenly come forward?"
QSA Co-Chair Emma Q. Wang ’12 said she was disappointed that Hammonds is only now speaking out about LGBT issues, and that her statement does not address problems faced by the community beyond the incident at Lamont. Wang described Hammonds' e-mail regarding the books as "poor timing," considering the series of LGBT suicides across the nation and the two  hate crimes—one an assault on an undergraduate by people shouting  homophobic slurs, and the other anti-gay graffiti in a graduate dorm—that occurred at Harvard earlier this semester.
"I don’t think this issue was handled with the degree of sensitivity and care it could have been," Wang said, noting that while the incident is no longer being characterized as a hate crime, it still had an impact on the LGBT community. "It is the College’s responsibility to treat everyone in the community as an equal and to shoulder equal responsibility for incidents that affect that community."
While Hammonds did not release a statement in response to the incidents affecting the LGBT community earlier in the semester, today’s statement does stress ongoing attempts to foster inclusion and diversity on campus. She wrote that these attempts reflect the College’s desire "to uphold important community values of civil engagement on moral and ethical questions in a diverse world," naming both the ongoing BGLTQ Working Group and the Sustained Dialogue Program as striving to fulfill these missions.
Hammonds convened the BGLTQ Working Group in October with the purpose of evaluating the needs and resources of LGBT students and allies. She wrote in the statement that she has asked the Working Group to consider the Lamont incident in formulating their recommendations to the Dean, to be delivered in March, regarding LGBT needs at Harvard. The Sustained Dialogue Program is part of a nationwide network with the aim of creating venues for discussions on issues of diversity and was also adopted at Harvard at the start of the fall semester.
With this emphasis on encouraging conversations within the campus community, Hammonds concluded her statement on a positive note: "In the end, I am heartened by the chorus of support that this incident has elicited for all students, faculty, and staff within the Harvard College community, and value the important conversations it has prompted."
In the e-mail containing the link to Hammonds’ official statement, the  Dean addressed students at the College with the hope that the incident  would reaffirm the integrity of the College’s diverse community.
“This is an important moment to reiterate our shared values and to note  that Harvard College mandates that everyone show respect to all members  of our community," Hammonds wrote. "I hope you will join me in espousing and practicing  these shared principles."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes your best effort just isn’t good enough.
Despite outshooting its opponent for the fourth straight game, the Harvard women’s hockey team (5-6-2, 4-2-2 ECAC) came up short against another tough opponent, losing, 5-3, to No. 4/5 Boston University (14-2-3, 5-1-3 Hockey East) Friday night at Bright Hockey Center.
Though a two-goal effort from tri-captain Liza Ryabkina tied the game early in the third period, the Terriers knocked in a pair of scores in the span of less than 30 seconds to put the game out of reach.
“With the exception of about five minutes, might have been even less than that, we were right there with them,” Crimson coach Katey Stone said. “They’re a very good hockey team, extremely good—a lot of weapons, a lot of skill. And I thought our kids played tremendously well.”
The game was marked by a fast-paced, physical style of play that left both teams with limited looks at the net. But although Harvard outshot BU, 10-5, in the first period, the visitors entered the first break with a 1-0 lead.
After sophomore Josephine Pucci was called for tripping 3:21 into the game, the Terriers set up on the power play.
It took just under a minute for BU to cycle the puck to freshman star Marie-Philip Poulin, who one-timed a close-range shot past sophomore goaltender Laura Bellamy. Poulin—who scored both goals in the Olympic gold-medal game for Canada in February—was assisted by Jenn Wakefield and Jenelle Kohanchuk on the tally.
Harvard got a number of opportunities in the first, particularly on its two power plays in the period, but failed to find the back of the net.
The Terriers came out hard after intermission and dominated the first half of the second period, doubling their lead less than three minutes into the frame.
Wakefield fed the puck to Jillian Kirchner in the left circle, and the senior banked the puck off the far post for a 2-0 advantage at the 2:46 mark.
But Harvard’s defense locked down for the next 20 minutes, giving the offense a chance to get back in the game.
“They had a lot of really skilled players, but I think we stayed right with them,” Ryabkina said. “Overall, I thought that our defense did a tremendous job keeping them out and shutting them down.”
With just under seven minutes to go in the second, the Crimson was finally able to set up in its offensive zone. Tri-captain Kate Buesser fired a pass across the ice, and Ryabkina one-timed the puck into the top right corner of the cage.
“Liza has a knack for getting available in the right spot,” Stone said. “She’s got such a strong shot that, if we can get it to her, nine times out of 10, good things will happen.”
The Crimson defense then killed off another penalty late in the period to head into the second break with all the momentum on its side.
Just 1:45 into the third, Kohanchuk was sent to the box for cross-checking, giving Harvard its third power-play opportunity of the evening.
Ryabkina didn’t waste the chance, firing another one-timer—this one assisted by tri-captain Leanna Coskren and Pucci—past Terrier netminder Kerrin Sperry to level the score at two.
It was the fourth straight game that the Crimson’s top power-play unit—composed of Ryabkina, Coskren, Pucci, Buesser, and senior Katharine Chute—found the back of the net.
“We’re getting better, we’re getting used to each other,” Stone said. “We’re getting better looks at the net, which is really important. Kids are possessing the puck a little bit more, which is good. We’re not throwing it around.”
But things quickly unraveled for Harvard, as BU found the net twice in the span of 28 seconds to push its lead back up to 4-2.
“I think everybody was just really excited [after the tying goal], and people started feeling like, ‘Yeah, we can do this,’” Ryabkina said. “It was unfortunate that they scored pretty shortly after.”
With 16:19 on the clock, Wakefield knocked a pass from Kaleigh Fratkin past an out-of-position Bellamy to put the Terriers ahead by a score. Jill Cardella followed with a quick transition goal of her own off assists from Kohanchuk and Catherine Ward to kill the Crimson’s comeback bid.
“Just young mistakes, I think,” Stone said. “We are young, but we also need to be a little bit sharper.”
Poulin added her second goal of the game with six minutes to play to give BU a 5-2 lead. But the Crimson kept battling until the end, and with 0.3 seconds left on the clock, Chute slipped a puck past Sperry to make the final score 5-3.
Junior Alisa Baumgartner and sophomore Whitney Kennedy recorded assists.
The loss marks the conclusion both of the 2010 portion of Harvard’s schedule and of the toughest stretch of the Crimson’s season. Harvard has played ranked opponents in six of its last seven games and has gone 2-4 in those contests.
“We had a few bad steps and mistakes, and that hurt us,” Stone said. “We’ve got to play pretty perfect defense, I think. But overall, our effort was unbelievable...And now it’s a matter of us getting better and better.”

What had been billed as a pivotal matchup for the Harvard men’s basketball team turned out to be a blowout—at least after halftime.
Following eight winless years against its crosstown rival, the Crimson (6-2) made it two victories in a row over Boston University (4-7) Saturday afternoon, using a strong second-half effort to defeat the Terriers, 87-71. A crowd of 1,487 saw six players reach double-digit scoring for Harvard, which improved to a perfect 5-0 record at home and has won its last 13 non-conference matchups at Lavietes.
The latest entry in the win column had its outcome decided early in the second half, during which the Crimson managed to shoot a blistering 71.4 percent from the field.
With 17 minutes remaining, BU tied it up at 43-all on a baseline jumper by senior star John Holland, who led his squad with a game-high 21 points. But on the other end of the floor, sophomore guard Christian Webster quickly responded with a right-wing triple for three of his 18 points, a team high. The swingman gave the Crimson a lead it would not relinquish, as the team then proceeded to flex its offensive muscle and blow the game wide open.
Harvard received buckets from seven different players to erupt on a 29-7 run in the next nine minutes of play.
“I thought we defended much better in the second half,” Crimson coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we defended, and I thought we got up the floor...we gave ourselves some open looks and moved the basketball...those things lead to points and lead to positive possessions.”
Backcourt starters sophomore Brandyn Curry (10 points) and junior co-captain Oliver McNally (11) each buried crucial shots from behind the arc during the stretch, while rookie Laurent Rivard (15) came off the bench to hit jumpers from all over the floor.
And junior co-captain Keith Wright, turning in his fourth double-double of the year with 17 points and 10 rebounds, topped it all off with a layup to give Harvard a 72-50 advantage with 8:20 left. His team’s lead would not fall below 16 the rest of the way. The sixth player in double figures was perhaps the most unlikely. Starting for the first time in his career, junior big man Andrew Van Nest made the most of the opportunity given to him.
“I thought he performed very well,” Amaker said. “We thought we needed to give our team a little shot...and I liked how it turned out for us today.”
In 23 minutes of action, the 6’11” forward collected 13 points—surpassing his previous career high of nine—and five rebounds and made his defensive presence felt on the interior.
“I was super hyped to get the start finally,” Van Nest said. “It was fun to get out there and really go to work, from the beginning—getting in the flow.”
Picking up a trio of blocks, he altered shots in the paint and challenged Terrier forward and former AAU teammate Jake O’Brien, who eventually moved out to the perimeter and collected 20 points.
“I know his game...he’s all right-handed, and he always stops in the middle of the lane and tries a jump shot,” Van Nest said. “I got a hand up two times in a row, and I think that kind of threw him off initially...I never wanted him to feel comfortable.”
Van Nest’s contributions were even more valuable considering the showing of sophomore stud Kyle Casey, who looked to still be recovering from a broken foot sustained in the preseason, as well as a recent virus. The forward had three points and three fouls in 17 minutes.
“He’s got to get in better shape, obviously. That’s just a function of being out,” Amaker said. “I just think he’s rusty, and it’s going to be a while.”
Also a concern were Harvard’s struggles during the bulk of the first frame. Jumping out to a quick 16-8 lead during the game’s first five minutes, the Crimson then neglected to attack the rim or utilize its size advantage, instead settling for jump shots.  Faced with a BU zone defense, its three-point shooting went cold, as Harvard missed 10 straight shots from behind the arc.
A pair of long-range jumpers and free throws by Rivard in the final three minutes of the half gave the Crimson a narrow 35-33 lead heading into the locker room, but a revitalized attack in the final period—during which Harvard had 20 attempts from the charity stripe, compared to the Terriers’ six—helped the Crimson pass its last on-court test before the beginning of exams.

There’s nothing better than bouncing back from a tough loss with a blowout win.
For the Harvard women’s basketball team—which was coming off of an 86-65 loss to SEC opponent Florida last week—that was exactly what it got, as the Crimson (5-3) returned home on Friday and dismantled UNH (1-7), 96-63.
Harvard eclipsed the 90-point mark for the first time since defeating Northeastern in Dec. 2009.
“I thought it was a phenomenal offensive game,” said Crimson coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “It was a good enough defensive game, but I want to be better than that. Our transition defense broke down a little bit, and we gave them a couple of wide-open threes that we’re not happy about.”
“[After the Florida loss], we definitely had to come out harder, whether it was on defense, offense, rebounding, whatever,” said junior point guard Brogan Berry. “We really wanted to get our confidence up, and I think this game really helped us with that. We scored almost 100 points, so our offense was great, and we outrebounded the other team, which was also a great accomplishment.”
The Wildcats kept up with Harvard in the opening minutes of the game, but an aggressive drive by Berry to the basket helped the Crimson break the contest open.
Though senior forward Emma Markley started the game 0-for-6, sophomore forward Victoria Lippert maintained Harvard’s offensive production in the paint with two post-ups to notch her first points. Markley would finish the night an underachieving 3-for-12 from the field for nine points to go along with five rebounds.
“I liked the shot selection from Emma,” Delaney-Smith said. “They didn’t go in, but those are the type of shots that usually go in for Emma; she shouldn’t be bothered. If your shots aren’t falling, you draw a double and triple team and be a rebounder. Emma’s very effective and not one-dimensional, and if she was taking bad shots, that’d be one thing, but she wasn’t. She was taking good shots.”
Midway through the opening half, a steal by sophomore guard Jasmine Evans—who crashed into press row saving the ball—got the crowd on its feet after freshman Christine Clark made a wide-open three off of the UNH turnover. Co-captain and sharpshooter Christine Matera capped off the half with an NBA-range triple from the right corner, taking the Crimson into the locker room with a comfortable 44-25 lead.
The hot shooting streak continued for Harvard in the second half as the team scored seven straight points to fend off any chance of a letdown.
An open three by UNH guard Lauren Wells got the Wildcats to within 17 points, but that would be as close as the visiting team would get. With 13:07 to go, Berry once again weaved her way to the basket, converting on a three-point play that put Harvard up, 59-31. The junior was nearly perfect in the game, finishing her night with 8-for-9 shooting for a season-high 22 points and five assists.
“Brogan was great,” Delaney-Smith said. “Her shot’s been off this year, and we’ve been working on it. It’s not anything physical, it’s just focus and strategy, but she came together tonight.”
Back-to-back three-pointers from Lippert helped the Crimson maintain a 26-point lead with 8:33 to go. From there, Clark paced Harvard to victory with six straight points, allowing Delaney-Smith to put her second team onto the court.
Clark had the best night of her young career, scoring 18 points, grabbing three rebounds, and dishing out three assists.
“I sound like a broken record, but she gets better and better every game,” Delaney-Smith said. “She’s a very athletic kid, she’s a very skilled kid. You can’t play her one way. She’s reading the defense, and that’s the adjustment that’s making her so good.”
Overall, the Crimson finished the night shooting a lights-out 64.7 percent from behind the three-point arc and 51.4 percent from the field. Harvard outrebounded UNH, 42-29, and finished the game with 19 assists and just nine turnovers.
“I love playing on my own court, and everything was going right,” Berry said. “My teammates spread the floor really nicely, so I was able to drive. It was a solid team effort with great flow and energy.”

As the weather gets colder, the Harvard track and field team is already starting to heat up with strong results in its indoor season opener last weekend.
The Crimson made the trek across the Charles to compete in the Harvard Open on Saturday and returned with five top-two finishes and a qualifier for both the IC4A and ECAC Championships.
“I was really pleased with how the meet went,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “I thought it was a great start to our indoor season, and it’s a really good sign for things to come.”
“This meet is always sort of a rust buster,” co-captain Brian Hill said. “We are looking to get back into competition, and it was nice to start off well. It’s part of our training, but it’s with a purpose.”
While most of the team focuses on continuing to prepare for the bulk of the regular schedule, two Crimson runners already have the post-season in sight. Only one meet was necessary for co-captain Ablorde Ashigbi and sophomore Shannon Watt to earn their individual berths into the championship season.
Ashigbi’s weight throw of 17.45 meters topped his previous two qualifying distances and guaranteed him a spot in the IC4As for the third-straight year. The mark was good for a second-place finish behind former track and field co-captain, Jack Brady, who is now a Harvard Coaching Assistant.
In the women’s shot put, Watt posted a mark of 13.67 meters, clearing the qualifying line by .17 meters for a second-place finish and a bid to the ECACs.
“It’s fantastic to be able to qualify this early in the season,” Hill said. “It shows that we’ve got a lot of athletes that are at a great level already, and it takes a lot of pressure off the rest of the season.”
Junior Darcy Wilson had his own exciting finish. Leading the one-mile event in the last lap, Wilson faced pressure from Bentley sophomore Curtis Trueb but held him off to take the title by only .05 seconds. Wilson finished with a time of 4:17.21. Seven Harvard runners placed in the top-25 of the 110-runner field.
The middle distance women also kept up the energy and strong results, with senior Hilary May crossing the line first in the 3000-meter at 10:08.54. Three Crimson women also placed in the top 10 of the one-mile, with freshman Alaina Murphy, junior Meghan Looney, and freshman Natalia Paine finishing second, ninth, and tenth, respectively.
“They did some important work in their cross-country season,” Saretsky said. “I think their hard work certainly paid off in how they were able to open the indoor track season.”
The women’s weight throw also featured some quality marks, as freshman Adabelle Ekechukwu took eighth with a toss of 14.85 meters and sophomore Chelsea Gilbert finished 16th.
With over 2,000 family members and friends filling the facility, Harvard utilized the time to post some strong results before the start of J-Term and the beginning of its regular season.
“Having this early season meet was great after a long fall of base training,” Hill said. “It’s a great outlet and a bench-mark opportunity to put up some good marks. I think that we are all ready to gear up now and really get after it. We had a session with a lot of good performances that people can build on next month, and that is what we are really going to be looking at and focusing on.”
“I thought it was exactly what we were looking for and what we wanted to do this time of the year,” Saretsky said.

With reading period having come and gone, the majority of the Harvard community has a week and a half of finals to endure before settling in for a relaxing month of J-Term. But for the population of student-athletes that find themselves on the Crimson sports teams that compete during the winter season, the end of finals period signals the start of practice schedules even more rigorous than the ones they already have, as the second half of the winter season kicks off in earnest.
The Harvard men’s basketball team looks to continue its winning ways as it seeks to extend its current two-game winning streak, but the Crimson has its work cut out for it when it takes on the No. 6 UConn Huskies, who have gone undefeated in their first seven games of the season.
The women’s basketball team takes on Sacred Heart on Dec. 22, hoping to end the recent trend of alternating wins and losses by avoiding the loss that the pattern dictates and picking up a win. Neither of Harvard’s basketball teams has played a conference game yet, but both begin the Ivy League schedule against Dartmouth in January, as the men go up to Hanover on Jan. 8 and the women host the Big Green on Jan. 15.
Both the men’s and women’s ice hockey teams have already played several ECAC conference games, with the men posting a 2-7 record in the conference and the women a 4-2-2 record. The men will look to end their seven-game losing skid against Army on New Year’s Day while the women will try to notch another win for their conference record against Union when they return to action on Jan. 7.

Harvard athletes and movie stars are necessarily equated, but three Harvard alumni—the Winklevoss twins and Tommy Lee Jones—have managed to make a name for themselves on the big screen. Jones has long been one of the most respected names in the film industry while the Winklevoss twins have gained fame—or notoriety—through David Fincher's “The Social Network,” in which they were both played by Armie Hammer.
Here's a quick update on what the three celebrities have been up to.
WINKLEVII
Two of the only celebrity rowers in the world, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, are again in the news for their off-water pursuits. The “Winklevii,” as they are called in “The Social Network,” are still in the process of suing Mark Zuckerberg. The twins, who graduated in 2004, have already received $65 million from Zuckerberg and co. in a lawsuit, but they have alleged that Zuckerberg was dishonest about the value of the product and are appealing for more money.
TOMMY LEE JONES
In other celebrity news, former gridiron star Tommy Lee Jones's newest movie, The Company Men, premiered on Dec. 8. Rotten Tomatoes reports an average rating of 70% for the film. But Jones '69, who plays Gene McClary in the movie, skipped the event because he was in filming for Men in Black III, in which he will again team with Will Smith.
CRIMSON ROOTS
All three originally made headlines for their athletic prowess. An offensive tackle, Jones was an All-Ivy selection known for his role in Harvard's legendary 1968 29-29 “win” over Yale. In the rowing world, the Winklevii are still primarily known for their prowess on the water. As collegiate rowers, the pair rowed in the engine room of the Crimson's "God Squad" boat of 2004, which won the national championship and finished sixth at the World Cup in Lucerne, Switzerland. The twins also finished sixth in the men's pair event at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though the Harvard women’s basketball team started reading period with a loss on the road against Florida, the team returned to Cambridge in peak form, earning a win against New Hampshire just in time for the start of finals.
According to an Ivy League press release this morning, two members of the Crimson backcourt—junior Brogan Berry and freshman Christine Clark—garnered weekly all-conference recognition for their respective roles in this past week’s contests.
Berry earned her second Ivy League Player of the Week honor of the season, as Harvard rebounded from the mid-week loss with a 96-63 battering of the Wildcats Friday night.
The junior guard led the way with 22 points against UNH. Berry shot 8-of-9 from the field and contributed five assists and four steals for the Crimson. She led Harvard in scoring in Tuesday’s defeat as well, notching 15 points against the Gators. So far in the 2010-11 season, Berry is averaging 13.4 points and 4.2 rebounds per game, in addition to shooting an impressive 92.6 percent from the free-throw line.
Clark also had an impressive week, earning a spot on the Ivy League honor roll after an 18-point performance in Harvard’s victory against the Wildcats. The rookie also contributed three rebounds and three assists against UNH. Last week, she averaged 14 points per game, three rebounds per game, and four assists per game and is currently ranked fourth on the Crimson in scoring (11.8 ppg).
Harvard sits at 5-3 overall, though conference play has yet to begin. After a brief break, the Crimson will return to Lavietes Pavilion to take on Sacred Heart on December 22.

In light of the recent crimes that have taken place, three Flyby correspondents went on a late-night stroll to see just how safe HUPD’s designated pathways really feel. A ranking system was developed based on how safe and secure the correspondents felt in each of the key sites on the map. The sites are listed below, beginning with the site that appeared most safe and ending with the one that seemed least safe.
JFK and Mt. Auburn, JFK and Brattle:
Of all the spots on the designated pathways, these intersections gave us the least cause for fear. The two intersections and the pathway between them were well-lit, and trafficked by both pedestrians and cars. There were no blue lights, but instead multiple shops and restaurants, which would provide a safe haven up until midnight when stores begin to close.
Plympton and Mt. Auburn:
This intersection was well-lit with multiple bright street lamps and two proximal blue lights. The pathway is en route to the river houses and close to Adams, Quincy and Lowell; as a result it is well-trafficked and lively at most hours.
The Yard:
Upon entering The Yard at Johnston Gate, there is a bright street light and a blue light. After continuing into the yard, we could see blue lights on nearly every freshman dorm building, and also as far as Widener and Meyer Gate. Additionally, students being pursued can use their swipe card access to take refuge in freshman dorms. However, the bright Christmas lights illuminating the yard give a deceptive appearance of security that will disappear after the holiday season.
Garden and Chauncy:
This intersection, which is about halfway between the Quad and Cambridge Common, has multiple street lights and an easily accessible blue light. The fairly heavy car traffic helps ensure that in the case of an attack, there would be numerous observers who could help.
Garden and Shepard:
Students pass through this intersection when leaving or entering the Quad. Although it has one blue light and a street light, its isolation gave it a lower ranking. Because the intersection faces fenced residential communities, there are no accessible buildings nearby to enter easily in case of an emergency.
Law School at the corner of Langdell and Jefferson Halls:
This site also gets a lower ranking due to its isolation; however, it is very well-lit with a bright street lamp and a blue light. Additionally, other blue lights are visible across the Law School quadrangle and there are multiple directions to run in case of an emergency.
Shepard and Massachusetts Avenue:
Although this intersection, near North Hall, is along the main thoroughfare of Cambridge, its lack of a sidewalk due to current construction made it feel unsafe. If confronted by an attacker, a makeshift pathway created by a construction blockade on one side and a wire fence on the other offers only one direction for escape.  The intersection marks the end of the designated pathway on Massachusetts Avenue and features one final blue light.
Dunster and Winthrop: 
This intersection felt the least safe; it was isolated and a crime here would probably not attract as much attention. The intersection had only one bright street light, no blue lights, and barely any traffic. Being primarily residential, the area offered no public buildings for refuge.
NOTE: All blue lights had emergency call boxes.

CORRECTION: December 14, 2010
An earlier version of the Dec. 13 FlyBy post "Designated Pathways: Tested on Foot"  incorrectly identified the intersection of Dunster and Mt. Auburn  street as the apparently least safe intersection along HUPD's  designated pathways. The post intended to  identify the intersection of Dunster and Winthrop street.

As the illustrious career of Jeffrey A. Zucker '86, CEO of NBC Universal, nears an end, it appears that one "healthy rivalry" will still remain.
Reminiscing about his life at Harvard as President of The Harvard Crimson, Zucker spoke of his days teasing fellow student Conan C. O’Brien '85, a past President of the Harvard Lampoon, a semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine.
The two had a fair share of laughs during their time living together in the same House. Despite some recent tensions regarding O'Brien's contract that may have distanced the two graduates, Zucker and O'Brien were notorious for the pranks directed at each other during their time at Harvard.
Zucker fondly remembers the rivalry, especially the time when he "caught the Lampoon red handed in the street" after members of the organization had attempted to steal the President's chair from The Crimson. He managed to persuade police officers to arrest O'Brien and his fellow Lampoon thieves, making them sit "for like twelve hours" in a Cambridge jail.
Earlier this year, O'Brien recalled the same incident, stating that his first meeting with Zucker "was in handcuffs, with a Cambridge police officer reading [him his] rights."
Zucker is planning to step down from his job as CEO after Comcast takes over NBC in the spring. Why would he allude to the rivalry at a time so near the end of his career? We can only assume that the significance of the Crimson/Lampoon rivalry is as important now as it ever was.

CORRECTION: December 13, 2010
An earlier version of the Dec. 13 FlyBy post "NBC's Zucker Pays Homage to  O'Brien Rivalry" incorrectly suggested that Zucker was an employee  of CBS. In fact, Zucker is the President and CEO of NBC Universal.
CORRECTION: December 14, 2010
The post also incorrectly stated that Zucker and O'Brien lived in the same freshman  dormitory. In fact, Zucker and O'Brien did not live in the same freshman  dormitory, but they did both live in Mather.
