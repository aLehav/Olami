After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the Chicago hip-hop scene’s founding fathers has picked up the mic once more, proffering to his tumultuous city some wise advice from a veteran artist. Three years after “The Dreamer/The Believer,” Common has returned to the industry, again with longtime friend and production collaborator, NO I.D. “Nobody’s Smiling” sends a message of concern to his beloved Chi-town, touching on themes of violence and tumult in Common’s characteristically adroit—if inconsistent—manner.
Comparing the Common of today with the Common of the ’90s might very well disappoint. The rapper’s sophomore album, “Resurrection,” showcases a Common who is confident and suave, gracing each track with paramount sophistication and coolness. His debut record, “Can I Borrow a Dollar?” took all that was right in A Tribe Called Quest’s quirky, minimalistic, and jazzy tunes, and added an irresistible layer of breezy and cheeky rhymes. By contrast, addressing subject matter that is now grimmer than ever, Common has adopted a more severe tone, eschewing much of the casual flair that made him so lovable in the first place.
“Nobody’s Smiling” is a grave album. Opening with “The Neighborhood,” Common mourns the unfortunate reality of life in Chicago and connects to it personally: “Used to post up on that strip, I look like a street sign / I’ve been out there three days and I got shot at three times / Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine / I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind.” The lyricism in “The Neighborhood” is consistently rich and emotive, but the grave subject matter is certainly not conducive to casual listening. The same holds for the track “Nobody’s Smiling,” which supports its mournful sentiment with acutely discordant harmonies and a sedated tempo. Common does well in matching form to content in these brazenly sinister tracks. He successfully distills the fright and disenchantment these lyrics convey in the unsettling percussion and melodies upon which they progress.
Despite the album’s dark theme, there are points of flash and rejuvenation. Sampling Biggie’s “Hypnotize” in “Speak My Piece,” Common picks up where he left off on previous albums, sputtering through the track with a spirited, light, and seamless flow. Common exhibits his time-tested lyrical prowess, borrowing Biggie’s double entendre for “piece” and expanding on the wordplay throughout the track. “Real” is an equally bright spectacle of lyricism and, with its ’90s soul music inspiration, grants the nostalgic listener a mouthwatering taste of the Common of old. Given the success of this track, one might wonder why Common chose to shift away from his original style altogether. A look at the more congenial subject matter of “Real,” however, would attest once again to Common’s dutiful matching of form to content on this album—a demonstration of his matured artistry.
In the context of Chicago’s alarming reality, Common presents his call for pro-peace activism on “Kingdom.” In this epic incantation of six-and-a-half minutes, Common and the up-and-coming Vince Staples plea for spiritual guidance in diffusing the war unfolding on Chicago’s turf. Appropriately, the song is strung together over the chronic snapping of a military snare drum, with occasional interruptions by a thunderous choral of gospel singers for the hook. Armed with such cohesion among all aspects of the song, Common presents a vivid illustration of the sensitive and intricate entanglement of religion, gang allegiance, violence, and success. “Kingdom” is quick to engage politically, as Common spits, “And to think me and the president, we from the same place / 421 murders, ain’t tryna be of the same fate.” Common and Vince Staples continue to elegantly broach the issue of misguided ideals, highlighting profound but pervasive conflations regarding material, religious, and social prosperity. While reflective and genuine, the duo avoid sanctimony; striking such a delicate balance on an equally compelling track puts “Kingdom” at the top of the album and verifies that Common, though now 42 years old, has yet to exhaust his creative reserves.
Though much of the “Nobody’s Smiling” achieves the innovativeness and poignancy that has come to be expected of Common releases, at least a couple of songs have no business making an appearance. These include, from most missable to least, “Diamonds” featuring Big Sean (whose Kid Cudi impersonation is so grating it borders on the intolerable), and the bonus track “Out on Bond,” which oddly integrates a James Bond theme song into the track’s underlay. All told, however, Common was right to have seen his tenth studio album through. Not only has the artist added a fresh sound to his brimming catalog of records, but he has also delivered an inspiring and apposite socio-political charge to the community dearest to him.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
La Roux had a rather promising start. Their self-titled debut album was critically acclaimed and Grammy-winning, and their inimitable sound—with persistent retro stylings and paradoxically forceful and airy vocals—helped them carve out a niche in the electronic music world. Unfortunately, they seemed to have completely dropped off the map after their aggressive and fast-paced single “Bulletproof” lost its spot on the charts. After five years, La Roux has finally returned, though the long overdue sophomore album finds itself in the wake of a couple big changes. The most notable is that “La Roux” is now a moniker for Elly Jackson rather than a band name, after producer Ben Langmaid left the duo. Though the ’80s-influenced synthpop tradition of the eponymous album lives on, the newly solo Elly Jackson takes her electronic pop to new levels of raw emotion and sportive cheekiness on “Trouble in Paradise.”
Perhaps the greatest asset of this record is the interlacing of light and charismatic guitar grooves and calypso-inspired synth riffs. The pervasive guitar provides “Trouble in Paradise” with a lively and organic character not seen in other works in the genre. And though La Roux does take a few moments to slow things down and reflect on love gone awry, the album is upbeat at its core, walking a fine line between dance-ability and innovation. “Sexotheque” embodies much of La Roux’s new direction. Jackson clarifies the song’s less-than-lucid title by singing, “She wants to know why he’s not home / Oh, I bet money, money, money, I bet / he’s at the Sexotheque.” The lyrical pessimism, however, is offset by the almost tropical quality the synths take on and the lighthearted triplets in the guitar.
Though these fun—if not slightly superficial—tracks dominate the album, La Roux breaks out of the rut with the auspiciously placed “Silent Partner,” which finds success in its sudden rejection of calypso influence. The heavy synths play rather uncharacteristically eerie phrases during the record’s seven-minute-long celebration of the ’80s. Not to be shown up by the unnerving electronic soundscape, La Roux delivers stunning lines like “I've been living in the light of the shadows / Why won't you let me leave?” and “There's a thumping that's filled with violence, / and he creeps in through the walls at night.”
“Trouble in Paradise” is not without fault, however. The biggest letdown of the album is the final track, “The Feeling.”  With pleasantly fluttering vocals over an Enya-esque atmospheric backdrop, the song is by no means hard to listen to. Instead, it simply lacks interest and fails to live up to its emotive potential in the chorus, when Jackson sings, “When it's all okay, we know, you know / And I know, I've got the feeling.” “The Feeling” is decidedly less bold than the other song about relationship dysfunction on the album, “Cruel Sexuality,” and the instrumentation falls in the dull gap between the extremes of playful and moody found elsewhere on “Trouble in Paradise.”
Even during this minor setback, the greatest unifying force on the album, Jackson’s voice, persists. Her vocals, which at times border on conversational, are beautifully understated. Instead of going for big notes or embellished runs, she focuses on striking a balance between conveying a message and letting the cool electronic sounds resonate.
After a five-year hiatus, La Roux found a way to pick off right where she left off. In 2009, the group innovated on their debut album, and with her new album, Jackson has managed to refine that sound, without abandoning its quintessence, by tempering the synths with guitar and by mitigating her previously serious tone with a bit of flippancy. An album that cleverly draws from other genres and refuses to take itself too seriously, “Trouble in Paradise” proved that Jackson is singlehandedly capable of laying down a fantastic pop album.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam—I have had plenty of adventures in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam—or, as the locals (and I) call it, Saigon.
I could tell you about foreigners I know who are allergic to the most absurd stuff. A Korean who breaks out into rashes if he drinks any bottled water that isn’t Aquafina. Another who eats mangos every morning because it’s the only fruit to which he doesn’t have a reaction.
I could tell you about sitting on plastic stools around tiny tables on the sidewalk chatting with friends and drinking “cà phê sữa đá.” (The bland translation is milk coffee with ice. The truthful translation is a blast of chill in contrast to the humid heat in the heavenly form of espresso and condensed milk on ice.)
I could even tell you about my research internship, and the way Vietnamese bureaucracy intrudes here. Perhaps I could recount the despair one of my coworkers felt when, after waiting two weeks for permission to do her research from the local government, a phone call to one of the authorities pushed her start date back another seven days. I could talk about wasted trips to research sites.
But the most daring thing I’ve done in Vietnam: I dyed my hair.
I am 19 years old, and up until now, I had never dyed my hair. I like to tell people that’s because my parents forbid it. But really, I can sweet-talk my parents into a lot of things. It’s mostly because, up until now, I was too much of a wimp. I mean, they do say nature gifts you with certain things for a reason, right?
But I was staring out at the salon doors while waiting for a trim, and thinking to myself, “I am so very, very sick of my hair.” I also thought about how cheap it would be to get it dyed here (because a cut and a dye with highlights for less than $50 is definitely cheap). Finally, I thought, at the end of the day, it’s just hair.
So I went in and dyed it purple-red, with auburn highlights.
Maybe it would be more daring if my hair weren’t stereotypically Asian. Or if I dyed it purple or blue or something super exotic.
But it looks good, if I do say so myself. And I’m not the only one—I’ve gotten quite a few compliments on it. One lady actually even stopped me on the streets to take pictures to bring to her hair colorist.
It’s funny, the way getting my hair dyed reminded me of the things I love about being abroad. The way your mind grows soft, open, and vulnerable, and the way your judgment and vision gain crystal clarity.
Sometimes, being abroad isn’t so much about experiencing new things. It’s about being daring enough to do all the things that you didn’t let yourself do when you were at home.
