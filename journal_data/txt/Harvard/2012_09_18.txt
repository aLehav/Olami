BUTTER (Oct. 5)
In an election year, it’s not surprising to find political satire in the movie theater. But what you might not be expecting is a film that mixes political caricature, cutthroat competition, and saturated fat. Hence, “Butter,” a movie that stars Jennifer Garner as a small-town, conservative Iowan housewife hell-bent on keeping an adopted young orphan (Yara Shahidi) from winning gold at a Midwestern butter-sculpting competition. Directed by Jim Field Smith, who previously directed the 2010 film “She’s Out of My League,” this film already generated buzz when its production company invited former Republican Presidential contender Michele Bachmann and members of the Tea Party to co-host its debut in Iowa. Olivia Wilde, Hugh Jackman, and Ty Burrell also star in this raunchy, polarizing comedy. One hopes the satire is as cutting as a hot knife through—well, you know.
THE PAPERBOY (Oct. 5)
Leaving his “High School Musical” days behind, teen heartthrob Zac Efron stars along veteran performers Matthew McConaughey and Nicole Kidman in the upcoming drama, “The Paperboy.” Based on the eponymous novel by Pete Dexter, the plot follows a reporter (McConaughey) and his brother (Efron) as they attempt to vindicate a man facing the death penalty for a brutal murder. Kidman plays the foxy southern belle Charlotte Bless, who attempts to bring the alleged murderer (John Cusack) to justice. Judging by the trailer, we should not only be expecting an intense performance from Kidman, but also an opportunity for Efron to use the gritty, visceral plot in order to grow as an actor in a new, more mature, role. And ultimately, working in the film’s favor is the fact that director Lee Daniels is no stranger to adapting novels to the big screen such as the well-recieved 2009 film “Precious.”
 KILLING THEM SOFTLY (Sept. 21st) 
Those who like bloody, gritty, and profane dramas like “Silence of the Lambs” and “Bellflower” will probably enjoy this film. However, even skeptics of horror films may be lured into seeing it—97% of Rotten Tomato responders plan on going—because of Brad Pitt, who stars as a charismatic thug. Pitt, who has teamed up with director Andrew Dominik before in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,” plays a professional enforcer who ends up playing detective when a heist goes badly. Like his previous film, Dominik has based “Killing Them Softly” on an relatively obscure 1974 novel by George V. Higgins entitled “Cogan’s Trade,” which he picked up at a second-hand bookstore. However, if the movie proves as confusing and circuitous as the trailer, then prepare to get lost (remember, there is no stop and rewind option in the theater). Putting the action and violence aside, the remaining five percent of the movie looks promising thanks to stellar shots of New Orleans and witty dialogue, delivered flawlessly by Pitt and Richard Jenkins (his driver) as they psychoanalyze the psychopathic behavior of a hit man. In one scene, Pitt’s character explains, “We’re living in America, and in America you’re on your own”—a thinly veiled nod to contemporary politics and the economic crisis. Aside from that, this film seems no more realistic or relatable to current viewers than its societally discarded 1974 inspiration.
THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER (Sept. 21st)
It’s a bit odd that Emma Watson is described as “all grown up” on magazine covers for her new role in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” in which she plays a high-school outcast. Since she is the most well-known actor in the movie, her career move gives us a good lens through which to view the movie. Will she be as convincing and endearing in the role of androgynous Sam as she was playing frizzy-haired Hermione? Like “Harry Potter,” the theme of childhood innocence spoiled early by the realities and dangers of life looms large over “The Perks of Being a Wallflower.” And the measure of its success will similarly depend on the likability and on-screen chemistry between the three main leads, as Watson will once again finds herself sandwiched between two awkward adolescent boys. While the film promises to be far more innocent and clean than the cat-scratching, hair-pulling, trash-talking “Mean Girls” portrayal of high school, don’t be fooled, it also will have an edgy dark side. Stephen Chbosky, who is directing the film, also wrote the eponymous book, which recieved the third highest number of attempted censures according to the 2009 list of the American Library Association for its ample references to drugs, homosexuality, sex, and suicide that figure in the narrarator’s emo-yet-entertaining diary entries. With the author calling the shots hopefully this will be circumvented, for if Chbosky stays true to his witty writing, then the movie will likely prove age-appropriate for even the “all-grown-up” Harry Potter generation.
 CLOUD ATLAS (Oct. 26) 
This genre-blending, time-travelling epic weaves a story as self-reflexive and labyrinthine as any out there. Good thing it’s being helmed by three directors that, based on their film history, are well suited to the strenuous task. The Wachowski siblings, of “The Matrix” and “V for Vendetta” fame, and Tom Tykwer, director of “Run Lola Run,” have divvied up the various subplots from David Mitchell’s 2004 novel to share directing duties. To preserve the story’s theme of connection across continents and eras, the same set of actors—including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, and Doona Bae—each have several roles, up to six in Hanks’ case.The novel’s structure follows six tangentially related stories: that of a young lawyer on a sea voyage in the mid-1800s, a Dutch composer and his amanuensis in the 1930s, a 70s-era corporate suit cast who work in California, a modern-day publisher and his tragicomedic woes, a South Korean clone who lives in a  dystopia that raises questions about the consciousness of its victims, and a final character, even farther-flung in the future, who explains the ruthless, frightening world after the fall of modern civilization. Though the novel’s unique structure of mirrored chronology may not lend itself easily to film, its central condemnations of greed and destructive consumerism may yet ring true in the upcoming adaptation.
THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN -- PART II (Nov. 16) 
Despite Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson’s recent break-up headlines, their alter egos Bella and Edward are still together forever in the fifth  film of the “Twilight” franchise. The final installment finds Bella embracing life as a vampire alongside husband Edward and their half-vampire, half-human daughter Renesmee. The law-enforcing Volturi vampires suspect the Cullens turned a human child into a vampire —a crime punishable by death—and to prove their innocence, Edward and Bella must assemble a motley crew of vampires from around the world to attest to their daughter’s natural origins (displayed so vividly in the previous film). In director Bill Condon’s adaptation of Stephenie Meyer’s bestselling book, yellow contacts will be worn, teen wolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) will pledge his life to a newborn, and life-or-death dialogue will probably be delivered, once more, with comical sincerity. Stewart and Condon have hinted at a twist in the film’s ending that will surprise even the book’s readers. While the written series ends with a détente between the Volturi and Cullens, the trailer has footage of a wintery, action-packed fight scene between the groups. Whether this altercation takes place in the mind of clairvoyant vampire Alice (Ashley Green) or in reality is yet to be determined, but this Twilight film promises to bring entertainment—both intentional and unintentional—to the big screen one final time.

Disclaimer: This writer loves Grizzly Bear. A lot. As the band says on “Sleeping Ute,” the opening track of its new album “Shields,” “I can’t help myself.” I saw them last summer in Hyde Park, London, and their set was a transformative concert experience. Lead singer Edward Droste’s wife was expecting a child at any second, which gave the wistful, beguiling tracks of earlier albums “Yellow House” and “Veckatimest” a thrilling urgency that the recorded versions can only approximate.
Needless to say, this experience raised my expectations for their first album since 2009’s “Veckatimest” to unrealistically lofty heights. There is much that is admirable about “Shields,” but as its name inadvertently suggests, the album is a defensive effort that never once ventures outside the band’s comfort zone. Devotees of the band will find ample matter for praise, but little that is truly inspirational.
The album starts off promisingly with “Sleeping Ute,” whose deep, jarring guitar notes are rousing, grating, and unrelenting for the duration of the track. From the outset, the group’s trademark harmonies glide over the guitar chords seamlessly. There is no denying that on “Sleeping Ute” the band is in familiar territory. The track ends with Droste’s vocals with almost no instrumental accompaniment in a sequence that is remarkably similar to Veckatimest’s “I Live With You.”
Like “Sleeping Ute,” the aptly named “Yet Again” is not adventurous but showcases Grizzly Bear’s harmonic mastery and cryptic lyrics. Whereas on other tracks one vocalist of the Droste/Rossen pairing tends to dominate, here the two are perfectly in sync and in dizzying harmony. The song has a poetic lyrical ambiguity, as seen in the following neatly alliterative sequence: “It’s done before we try / It’s darkened and by night / A desert in deface.” This track displays the disarming skill and precision that has won Grizzly Bear so many admirers. Unfortunately, the track concludes with a relatively lackluster and confused guitar sequence, which is a misguided attempt to give the innocuous but beautiful track an edge that it does not need. Despite this, “Yet Again” is the closest the album comes to the euphoria of “Veckatimest’s” instant crowd pleaser, “Two Weeks.”
However, many of the songs on “Shields,” including “Yet Again,” follow the same predictable structure that becomes tired by the end of the album. “Speak in Rounds,” for instance, skimps on verses in favor of overly repetitive choruses and guitar hooks that overpower the song’s melodies and development. The asinine lyrics of the chorus, “Stepdad just wants to learn how to be alone,” cannibalize the track, destroying its structure to create a series of one-line loops.
When Grizzly Bear finally depart from the formula used on most of the previous tracks, things recover somewhat. “A Simple Answer’s” vivid lyrics actually form a narrative with strong images like “Forever onward / Across some tundra / The light is long / But it’s not long before it’s gone.” With its powerful, harmony-free delivery and prominent drums, this track is an compelling variant to the softer, more contemplative material on “Shields” and shows evidence of some experimentation. The somewhat heavy beat and vocals are well suited to the track’s nihilistic message.
By the time the album reaches its self-indulgent seven-minute conclusion, “Sun In Your Eyes,” there is no shadow of the urgency that so electrified the crowd on that torrid summer evening in London.  While there is much to admire in “Shields,” it suffers from complacency that is often the byproduct of mainstream success. By no means a shoddy effort, it is, nevertheless, unsatisfying.

ROVING REPORTER:
Fresh from karate and ballet classes, children gathered around with open ears and eager hands as Annawon Weeden, a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, brought traditional Native American dance and activities to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology on Saturday.
Children marveled at the Eastern Woodland culture, taking in the vibrant blue hues of the jewelry and the impressive size of the animal skins. Weeden, affiliated with both his mother’s native Mashpee Wapanoag community on Cape Cod and his father’s Narragansett origins in Charleston, Rhode Island, has a wealth of knowledge about the two communities to which he belongs.
Kyle, 12
RR: What are you making right now?
Kyle: A blue salmon.
RR: Are salmon normally blue?
Kyle: I think they’re salmon-colored.
RR: Right you are! Is that your favorite fish?
Kyle: No. Salmon taste funny, and they’re weird.
RR: So what’s your favorite fish?
Kyle: A Great White Shark!!!!!! [Grits teeth together.]
RR: Do you watch “Shark Week?”
Kyle: Does it look like I’m allowed to watch Shark Week?
RR: Well, you can almost get into a PG-13 movie.
Kyle: Great.
Leila Rose, 11
RR: Would you want to be the Wampanoag Powwow Princess?
Leila Rose: What is that?
RR: She’s kind of like Miss USA in the Wampanoag tribe.
Leila Rose: Would I wear a crown?
RR: I would imagine so. I don’t know if it would have diamonds on it.
Leila Rose: Then no.
Alex, 10
RR: What have you learned about Native Americans?
Alex: I’ve learned a couple things, like how they live, and what they used to make shelter, and what their culture is and what they would do for spirits and people who passed away.
RR: Wow, you’ve learned a lot. So what’s the coolest part of their culture?
Alex:  They would live near rivers, where they can get fish and food, and near woods and trees and stuff so they can hunt for other animals to eat. But I would never live near the river because it’s dangerous because you don’t’ know if there are any other tribes. Maybe it’s their territory and stuff.
RR: Would you live in a teepee?
Alex: I live in one right now.
RR: Sure, you do.
Alex: I’m serious. I’m not going to take you to my backyard. But you can ask my dad. I have a tent there and made a fort with pillows.
RR: You know, I have made some pretty strong forts in my day.
Alex: Aren’t you like 30?
RR: Not quite.
Trevor, 6
RR: Nice corn husk doll. Did you name it?
Trevor: “It” is a “boy,” and he is not a doll.
RR: What is he then?
Trevor: A ninja.
RR: What’s his name?
Trevor: Trevor.
Chelsea, 12
RR: Do you know the name of the tribal chief of the Mashpee Wampanoag?
Chelsea: No.
RR: His name is Silent Drum.
Chelsea: How can a drum be silent?
RR: If you don’t bang on it.
Chelsea: I guess. I wouldn’t name myself something so confusing.
RR: What would you name yourself?
Chelsea:  Little Elephant.
RR: That’s like calling yourself ‘Jumbo Shrimp’
Chelsea: No, it’s not. I’m allergic to shellfish.
Liam, 12
RR: Did you learn about the Wampanoag in school?
Liam: Not really. I learned about them from reading. I learned about other Indians from a TV show I watch.
RR: Which show?
Liam: “Deadliest Warrior.”
RR: I’ve never seen that. Or heard of it. And it sounds scary.
Liam: It sounds scary because you’re a girl. Basically the Comanches were fighting the Mongols. It showed how they used to make their weapons and how powerful they are.
RR: How would they make their weapons?
Liam: They would put a stick and a stone together and really sharpen them to make spears, and they would make tomahawks from stone.
RR:  You know if you were in that tribe, you would learn how to make those weapons and develop your skills every day.
Liam: I know. I would rather do that than go to school.
RR: Wouldn’t you miss your friends?
Liam: No.

Is there really anything new we can say about love? The New Urban Theatre Laboratory’s new production of “…It’s a LOVE thang” does its best to present two interpretations that both update this theme while not straying far from the established cliché. The show ran at the Boston Playwright’s Theatre from September 6 to 16 and is composed of two short plays—“The Delicate Art of Customer Service” written by Cliff Odle and “Gift of an Orange” by Charlene A. Donaghy—both of which are directed by Jackie Davis. With only four actors in the entire show, the production is focused and intimate, with the two contrasting halves presenting a take on love that is complicated by very different sets of obstacles. True to the NUTL’s roots athese latest works are experimental and drawn from playwrights who are underrepresented in the mainstream theatre world. But not all experiments go according to plan; ultimately, “LOVE thang” strikes a lopsided balance between a bizarre and melodramatic first act and a much stronger and more mature second half.
“The Delicate Art of Customer Service” explores what happens when two former lovers, both locked in a midlife crisis, must “service” a client in a criminal profession they had both hoped to leave behind. “Delicate Art”, unfortunately, is anything but delicate, and the shortage of subtlety is the productions greatest weakness. Taking itself too seriously to be funny, yet too melodramatic to be satisfying, it wedges itself into an awkward middle ground in the first scene from which it never recovers. With unnatural lines of dialogue like, “Think of a lie as a creature that uses parthenogenesis to procreate,” and the achingly forced, “You order from the menu like you’re trying to figure out the Pythagorean theorem,” the work comes off as artificial. An overly theatrical sex scene makes the play seem even more absurd. These shortcomings are not the fault of the actors; James Bocock, who plays the male lead in “Delicate Art”, renders his part in the latter half of the program without any difficulty, and Jenny Gutbezahl, who plays his feminine counterpart, delivers her lines with conviction and force. However, the play as a whole reaches for a depth of meaning it does not grasp and leaves the cast’s most sincere efforts looking like caricatures.
Fortunately, “LOVE thang” comes close to redeeming itself in the second act, thanks largely to a skilled performance by Dayenne C. Byron Walters. Walters plays Oshun, an independent, self-proclaimed “voodoo woman” who lives in the steamy wilds of Louisiana’s Bayou. Oshun survives by selling potions and by casting spells that use the magical oranges that grow in her yard. The ethical implications of her way of life are brought to the forefront when when her calls upon the spirits go awry. Instead of receiving the strong and loving man she asked for, she instead gets an innocent 19-year-old boy.
In addition to working as an actress, Walters is trained in traditional and contemporary Haitian and African-inspired dance. Her dancing and singing is a real highlight of the performance. For example, when she casts her spell she contacts the spirits through a beautifully choreographed dance that acts to contrast her traditionally grounded lifestyle with the modern struggles of the men she encounters, such as finding a job or getting an education. Actor Richard Caines, who plays Oshun’s young love interest Taurean, also deserves credit for his performance as the wandering ex-football player who stumbles unwittingly into Oshun’s charmed world. The physical chemistry between Caines and Walters comes across as tense and genuine. Playwright Charlene A. Donaghy was inspired by “Gift of an Apple”, a short story by Tennessee Williams about a hitchhiker who goes astray in the wilderness.
Director Jackie Davis and the production team have succeeded in making the Bayou come alive on stage as a mystical, sensuous, and luxuriously unhurried environment. At one point Walters peels one of the magical oranges from her yard on scene, and the sweet aroma wafts through the audience. An auditory backdrop of subtly rustling insects and pulsating African-inspired drum rhythms give the Bayou a life of its own. This is a place of heat and mystery, where football and oil rigs reign supreme and where nothing is entirely as it seems.
In ostensibly a man’s world, Oshun manipulates the people around her with her wit and body. While “Delicate Art” fails to do justice to the artistic themes for which it reaches, “Gift of an Orange” is a more successful meditation on power dynamics, selfishness, and loss.

Reporters of all stripes have weighed in on the Occupy movement, but how would an artist portray such a fascinating part of America’s recent past? For playwright and actor Danny Bryck, the answer is a one-man “docuplay” called “No Room for Wishing”—directed by Megan Sandberg-Zakian and playing at the Boston Center for the Arts and the Central Square Theater through October 9th. The show is comprised entirely of participant interviews beginning in October of 2011. This ambitious play, stands as one of the first theatrical works to critically examine the Occupy movement. Bryck’s ability to seamlessly move between so many different characters and perspectives allows him to successfully capture in an hour and a half the confusion and energy of the entire Occupy movement.
Throughout the play, Bryck impersonates the people he interviewed; all the characters in the show are directly based off of people he met at the protests last year. They include a young college anarchist, a weary war veteran, and a middle-aged former prostitute with three children. He puts on accents—from sweet southern to quick clipped Bostonian—and alters his body language to represent the rapid switches in character. The set is comprised of simple wooden boxes that Bryck occasionally rearranges to indicate passage of time or changes in location. It’s a flurry of movement, conversations, and viewpoints, much like the atmosphere of the Occupy movement at its genesis.
Bryck’s performance is so varied that it seems as if one man on stage is actually 30 or 40 different people. Each character’s mannerisms are unique; it is almost as if Bryck becomes a puppet through which all of the voices of Occupy are channeled. In one moment Bryck casts doubt on the actions of the Occupy protestors—“you don’t smash windows and then go to Starbucks,” said one character named Mufasa—and in the next makes an impassioned plea in support of the movement.
The surprising variety of opinions and people in the play was perhaps the most successful aspect of the performance. An event that for many people was just an annoying presence in a public space or local interest piece on the evening news took on a human element that shed light on the personal struggles of the protestors. There were aimless anarchists, recently homeless lawyers, an older man who believed people “shouldn’t have to just survive,” and even a woman for whom the protests presented an opportunity to engage with a new, meaningful community. The general arch of the plot followed the movement from Occupy Boston’s inception through to the end of the Dewey Square encampment, but the focus of the show was the humanity of the protesters at every stage of the protest’s development. The characters felt real because of Bryck’s meticulous study of the mannerisms of his real life inspirations.
Dennis, one of the few characters featured more than once, spoke from a documentarian point of view when he told the audience, “We need to ask, ‘Is this a movement about reform, or is this a movement about revolution?’”  This question loomed over the rest of the play, and each character forced the audience to ask themselves what the Occupy movement meant to them. Bryck made it clear that for those involved with the movement, the goals and ideals didn’t just dissapear even after the outdoor encampment in Dewey Square was disassembled at the end of 2011.

Os Gêmeos—“The Twins,” in Portuguese—are Otávio and Gustavo Pandolfo, identical brothers from São Paulo, Brazil, who make bright, cartoonish modern art about everything from poverty and social justice to subway stations and houses. Their first solo museum show in the United States, which runs through November 25 at the Institute of Contemporary Art, is whimsical and surreal—the featured works include paintings decorated with sequins and three-dimensional, collage-like pieces that depict ordinary life with a gleeful fascination.
“There are many references throughout their work that are an invitation inside their head,” said ICA adjunct curator Pedro Alonzo, who organized the exhibit and has worked with the Pandolfo brothers on previous shows. The origins of the twins’ aesthetic, Alonzo said, are in street art that came out of the Brazilian hip-hop movement. “That is mixed with their own surreal fantasy world that they want to share with us,” he said.
In addition to its focus on the everyday, the art on display at the ICA is replete with references to exposure and connection—a face opens up to reveal another, different face inside of it; a house’s roof is removed to show the contents inside; and in one corner sits a massive piece titled “Os Musicos” (“The Musicians”), a modified organ that uses sound samples to access the twins’ minds and memories.
“The brothers make a real effort to have an unmediated relationship to the general public,” Alonzo said. “It’s a hard thing to accomplish with abstraction, so they do it with characters.” These characters are the twins’ signature yellow people, half-imp, half-Simpsons beings who populate their paintings and murals, including one enormous mural outside Boston’s South Station.
The yellow people also make an appearance in “Os Musicos,” albeit in a different form. The entire piece consists of several dozen speakers mounted in the corner of the gallery, colored yellow or brown, with painted-on eyes and hair and speakers for mouths. The speakers are controlled by the organ, which sits in front of the sculpture. Each key on the organ corresponds to a speaker mounted on the wall, and instead of playing a note, each key corresponds to its own sound bite—a burst of laughter, a mechanical whir, or a hip-hop beat, for instance. Playing combinations of keys produces shifting textures of sound rather than melodies.
The sound samples are drawn from the Pandolfo brothers’ own lives, but as Alonzo said, they are meant to be abstract enough to be relatable for the general public. “These are sounds that mean something to them, that they picked out,” Alonzo said. By using sound’s power to provoke recollection, the twins are opening up their own heads, pouring out their memories, and allowing exhibit-goers to find a connection.
Though the “Os Musicos” installation is intended to be interactive, it is part of a private collection, and as such, the general public is not permitted to play the instrument. Instead, the ICA enlisted the assistance of several professional musicians to play it. Elaine Rombola, one of the musicians who will play the sculpture for 15 minutes on the third Saturday of every month, sat down at the organ for the first time this past Saturday.
Rombola described her approach to the performance: “I’m trying to at least get all the notes played, so that everybody gets a chance to hear every sample,” she said. “Then I want to play around with how they layer with each other.” Due to the organ’s unique format, she said, her thought process deals more with the pacing and density of the sound than with traditional considerations such as harmony and rhythm. “When you sit down at a keyboard, you make your hands into the shape of a chord and you expect to hear a chord,” she said. “But with this organ, that’s not the case.”
On Saturday, Rombola played the organ to a small but attentive audience. The device sounded like a memory, or more specifically, the process of remembering: sounds popped up, blended together, then vanished; some noises lasted for almost a minute as the other sounds around it bloomed and disappeared; sometimes it sounded like a street fair, riotous and chaotic, and sometimes it sounded like a quiet evening at home, hushed and subdued.
Semira E. Rose, an ICA patron who watched Rombola’s performance, admitted that she did not immediately connect to the performance. “But in the middle—it feels like they want people to connect to the sounds of the city,” she said. “And my teenage sons listen to hip-hop, so when some of those beats popped up, I started connecting more.”
That kind of association—clearly removed from Os Gêmeos’ own interactions with hip-hop, but nonetheless resonant with Rose’s experiences—is consistent with the twins’ artistic intentions in general. “It’s meant to stir memories,” Alonzo said.

In an age when everything from classified ads to restaurant reviews has taken on a bottom-up, democratic structure, the Pro Arte Chamber Orchestra’s collective approach to classical music seems pcularly contemporary: as one of only four cooperative orchestras in the country, the group grants performers as much say in the artistic direction of the ensemble as the director. The conductor leads the orchestra in performances and rehearsals, but the players themselves are the ones who, among other orchestral duties, select the program.
The organizational framework of an ensemble does not mean much if the music is not good, though, and Pro Arte’s September 9 performance in Sanders Theatre did its unique format credit. The orchestra gave solid renditions—technically wonderful, never quite exhilarating, but scarcely boring—of two Beethoven masterpieces, the “Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61” and the fourth symphony.
The afternoon began with the violin concerto, a staple of the solo violin repertoire, and soloist Arturo Delmoni did the part justice. Delmoni moved nimbly among the piece’s long and fast passages and scarcely batted an eyelash, and in the third and final movement, during the closing cadenza, his control was outstanding as he landed heavily and precisely on sustained notes.
The orchestra played off Delmoni very well—they pulled at the seams between soloist and ensemble only briefly, during a particularly difficult tutti violin passage, when the orchestra sped slightly ahead of Delmoni. Dynamically, their balance was exceptional—never once was Delmoni drowned out by the players behind him, and never did it sound like the orchestra lost interest. The first movement’s rudely intrusive D sharps, a half step above the concerto’s key center of D, could have sounded grotesque but instead, through the orchestra’s smooth but weighty playing, felt appropriately heavy.
During the concerto, Delmoni never ventured into the realm of theatricality, an attitude that characterized the orchestra’s performance in general. There were no gross bursts of dynamics, no protracted pauses—none of the artistic decisions the orchestra made felt contrived or melodramatic. This ethos reflected a relatively conservative approach to Beethoven’s music, and considering the repertoire of the group, the style seemed appropriate. Many of Beethoven’s pieces, especially many of his titanic later works, lend themselves to a dramatic, podium-pounding interpretation; however, the violin concerto and the fourth symphony are among the less grandiose of Beethoven’s pieces and therefore merit a more subtle, restrained treatment.
Sandwiched between the much more famous third and fifth, Beethoven’s fourth symphony is often overlooked. It is neither as dramatic nor as immediately entertaining as the works on either side of it, but it proved the highlight of the afternoon in Pro Arte’s energetic rendition. In the first movement, the string players wove Beethoven’s melodies dexterously in and out of each other with celebratory exuberance. Above it all, conductor Kevin Rhodes seemed more a guide than a leader; occasionally, when his conducting became purely functional rather than independently expressive, it seemed the orchestra could have continued playing without him.
The second movement was characterized by a perfectly balanced conversation between the different sections of the orchestra, with the strings carrying a melody that the brass and winds would interrupt, sometimes pleasantly, sometimes abruptly. The fourth movement simmered—and frequently boiled over—like a pot on a stove. The cellos, basses, and timpani laid down a warm, unobtrusive carpet of sound across which the higher instruments danced gleefully, until the occasional moment when a burst of forte sixteenth notes would dominate the moment.
Taken as a whole, the orchestra’s performance didn’t seem to be especially influenced by the group’s unique organization—it wasn’t the case that Pro Arte’s democratic nature translated into a more egalitarian, more cohesive performance than those of traditionally managed orchestras. Instead, Pro Arte simply gave a great classical music concert, and really, that’s all that matters.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the night of September 7th, moisture was running down the wrong side of the walls of the event hall in the Student Organization Center at Hilles, more colloquially known as the SOCH. A couple sniffs, disconcertingly enough, revealed the source of the moisture was not rain but the prespiration of the students at the Rush Hour dance.
Perhaps until the next round of renovations of the SOCH are underway, the walls of the event hall will break out in a fragrant and disturbingly visible sheen annually for Rush Hour. Hosted by the Asian American Brotherhood, the Black Men’s Forum, the Black Students’ Association, and the Chinese Students’ Association, Rush Hour usually packs the hall with students: good for the organizations’ publicity, unfortunate for those pressed up against the drenched glass.
At least Rush Hour attendees can now take a breather and wring out their hair in the recently renovated first-floor lounge of the SOCH. The underlying purpose of the renovations—to increase student accessibility and use of the SOCH—raise questions about how the design of party spaces on campus shapes the Harvard social dynamic and the factors that influence where Harvard students choose to spend the dark hours of their Saturday nights.
GOOGLE GLAMOUR
The SOCH building does not usually entertain the type of crowd attracted by Rush Hour; students on campus or in river houses do not tend to be enthusiastic about trekking up to the Quad for any reason. Though the SOCH has always been spacious and airy, prior to the 2012-13 school year the first floor lobby looked like a conventional office lounge, complete with dully colored plastic chairs and the occasional pile of cardboard boxes in the corner.
If the lobby area still resembles an office area, that office is in the headquarters of Google or another corporate campus: the kind of office where it is acceptable to play Tetris at your desk or bring your cat to work. Two brand-new high-definition televisions hang on opposing walls of the lounge, while a pristine kitchen area whispers of endless opportunities to nick unsuspecting students’ leftovers. If thievery doesn’t appeal to you,  new vending machines, including a Starbucks coffee machine, offer a more dignified route to sustenance, while the community hall has been remodeled to look like a meeting space rather than a study room.
“[The student vision] was about making the space unique, especially because of that geographical barrier to the quad in general,” UC President Daniel P. Bicknell ’13 says. “We wanted to draw students from the [Yard] as well as from the River.”
Changes to the event hall are less noticable than those to the lounge but just as significant. “While the student houses have spaces, usually dining halls, where dances and parties are held, the SOCH event space is probably unique as a dance floor with its disco lights and built-in AV equipment,” project architect Eric Ward of Einhorn Yaffee Prescott Architecture & Engineering wrote in an email.  “The adjacent living room area, with its quiet seating and games, will also be a great amenity as a break-out space for a dance event.”
In fact, the new aesthetic of the event hall is comparable to that of a popular nightclub, according to Anna M. Remus ’13, a club promoter and DJ manager.“
This is actually pretty common in a nice club,” Remus says as we walk through the remodeled areas of the SOCH, tapping the floor of the event hall with her foot. “The floor will either be wood or this kind of linoleum. And the whole statement color, black-and-grey thing is pretty common.”
But there isn’t much else the SOCH has in common with a nightclub; even if Rush Hour packed the house, the new design lacks a classic feature of nightlife spots. “With this space, there’s no cut-off or anything. There’s nowhere for people to ‘hide.’” Remus says, taking in the new event hall. “In a normal club, you’ve got either a balcony or a second floor, or multiple rooms that can be opened up. Sometimes there’s a VIP section, or little alcoves--things like that. Here, everything’s out there all at once.”
It’s true: not everyone wants a large number of people to see what exactly they’re doing at all times at a college party. Large, open, and undivided rooms can be reminiscent of a 7th-grade dance. “They have so much map and logo stuff everywhere that it kind of feels like you’re going to a middle school thing,” Remus says as we leave the lobby, which bares a floor map and is emblazoned with  the SOCH’s logo.  She also notes the visible office rooms in the lounge.
Architects, administrators, and students all agree that the new space is attractive, versatile, and dynamic. “The renovations have definitely made the SOCH more appealing. [The renovations] were about trying to brand the SOCH as a versatile space capable of holding events, being a study space, and having that cafe vibe,” Bicknell says. “You basically can do whatever you want in that space, and that’s a huge advantage. It’s unlike any other space on campus.”
Though the space has many functions, the desire to facilitate student parties is an undeniable concern of the renovations. “The new Event Hall includes substantial speakers and subwoofers, party lights, dance floor, and curtains,” wrote SOCH manager Doug Walo in an email since he declined to be interviewed by phone or in person. “These enhancements were all a direct response to student feedback on the challenges students faced running parties in that space in the past.” I chose to explore the party spaces we know and love on campus to see how the SOCH measures up; if the architecture of the SOCH is supposed to have a large impact on its success as a social space, then the architecture of the party spaces we already frequent is something to be investigated.
PUREL SHOTS
Barely a minute’s walk from the SOCH lies an alternative for social events: the Ten-man suite in Currier House, named quite simply after its housing capacity.Composed of ten singles around a large common room, the Ten-man is also known as a very social suite, frequently hosting house parties on weekends and serving as “Heaven’” during Halloween’s Heaven and Hell Dance.
Featuring a private roof, kitchen, and elevator, the Ten-man condenses the majority of its open space into a single area. The suite still has additional space sectioned off from the large common room in the form of bedrooms, which differentiates the common room from a space like the SOCH’s event hall. The Ten-man seniors see their suite as a social space for the house and thus do their best to host parties whenever they can.“
Obviously this is a space where we live, but it’s also a gift we’ve been given,” Louis R. Evans ’13, a resident of the Ten-man, explains. “We don’t want our space to go unused.”
Though the Ten-man lacks the SOCH’s bells and whistles, the architecturally simple space achieves its purpose. “The best part about the room that makes it useful for socializing is that all the rooms are directly off of it,” another Ten-man resident, Christian A. Rivera ’13, explains. “You have to interact with people while you’re here.”
Remus also points out that the nearby singles would be attractive to some at parties. “Everyone wants somewhere to run off to at some point,” she says. “So the bedrooms would probably be an advantage during parties. Could be bad for the people living in there, though.”
Though potentially having your bedroom invaded is less than appealing, the seniors living in the Belltower suite of Pforzheimer House are proud to take on the burden. They have inherited more than a bent spire and the decorative lights that spell out ‘Pfoho’ in the common room of the top floor.
“You’re doing it for Pfoho, in a sense,” Frankie K. Wong ’13 says of living in the Belltower. “We keep the house running.”The Belltower, as the largest suite in the Harvard dormitories, has historically been seen as an inclusive, highly social suite. With 12 bedrooms, three common rooms, two stories, and a built-in bar on the top floor, it comes as no surprise that the Belltower is packed full on many a Friday night.
The features that make the Belltower so appealing to the student body go beyond the possibilities offered by the bar. The layout of the suite, as well as the additions and alterations made by the current residents, is suggestive of a typical nightclub. The bottom floor, furnished mainly by futons, can serve as a socializing area or a place to take a break from the bursting up per floor, where people usually dance or crowd around the bar.
The suite is cleverly designed to make it feel even more spacious than it already is. Long, narrow hallways give the impression that it is a farther walk between rooms than it actually is; a large mirror that spans the wall behind the bar almost seems to double the size of the common room on the top floor. Though that room in particular becomes very cramped very quickly, this actually can be attractive to partygoers. If it is too spacious, a room can make partygoers feel isolated and overexposed to other students. As Remus noted, partygoers typically appreciate places to hide. At parties, it is possible that students take an amount of comfort in the fact that they cannot be seen and observed by every other attendee. But Belltower residents are quick to point out that a large part of the appeal of the suite is its versatility. The suite has in the past hosted stein clubs, movie screenings, and various events for house and school organizations.
“Everybody here knows the Belltower, and it’s a house space,” George X. Fu ’13 says. “We have a very close-knit house community and part of that is that everyone hangs out in the Belltower. It has traditionally been a place where the whole house gathers.”
Even during a party, the dynamic of the suite can be changed to accomodate different events simply by informally sectioning off rooms and rearranging furniture. “The setup we have here is really conducive to being able to throw just about anything we want,” Fu says.
Versatility seems to be a common theme in discussion of social space. The Belltower and the SOCH in particular count it among their chief merits. Yet, there is something undeniably different about the atmosphere of these spaces. The Belltower can serve many purposes, but it can be completely reconfigured depending on the occasion; the SOCH, designed with versatility in mind, functions differently. “The SOCH 1st floor was designed with an eye for the synergy between flexible spaces filled with lots of great amenities such as the game tables, video games and TVs, AV equipment, and a variety of quality furniture and both programmed and casual use by students,” Walo wrote. Perhaps there is a cost to synergy; for partygoers who need the illusion of anonymity and liberation in order to let loose, this atmosophere could be dispelled by the sight of campus organization offices and Purel dispensers in the SOCH.
DEAD PARTY ANIMALS
No one can swipe into a final club or any of the Greek houses. When a party is being thrown in one of the brick and mortar houses on Mt. Auburn St., it’s not always guaranteed that a friendly Harvard student will be allowed in. The interior of these places can be less than seductive; the stuffy basement of the Sigma Chi house tends to smell overwhelmingly of stale beer on Thursday nights. It can be unsettling to party while preserved animals which rest on some of the final clubs’ walls stare glassily into the room. Despite this, lines of students form outside these houses every weekend.
The exclusivity itself is a substantial factor, but aspects of their design or architecture actually contribute to their appeal as social spaces. A certain sense of intimacy can be found in many of the houses: after all, they still serve as living spaces for brothers or club members. As Remus told me earlier, heavily divided space, offering a plethora of dimly lit nooks and crannies, is attractive to college students looking to let loose; Sigma Chi is no exception.
The final clubs and frat houses are also set apart from on-campus suites and event halls by decor. The walls of the Belltower and Ten-man are generally blank, the futons mismatched, and the floors are worn down. The conditions of the suites are not due to any negligence or oversight on the part of their residents, but simply because the rooms have endured years of heavy use, and decoration is not usually a significant part of a college student’s priorities (or budget).
Some of the frat houses have matching furniture sets and art on the walls, and if the hardwood floors are worn down in some places, others are covered with carpets. Some final clubs’ walls are actually paneled or hidden by shelves of leather-bound books. Wall space is occupied by plaques and, yes, the occasional taxidermied animal. In short, those houses feel truly lived-in, which potentially makes socializing feel more personal and intimate. And if any partygoer wants to sneak away (perhaps with company), fraternities offer more closed-off spaces to do so.
But typical criticisms of the final clubs do not stem from their design; the same exclusivity that attracts partygoers poses a problem for students who cannot get in. The discontent with these spaces—evident in multiple social space campaigns and a 2009 attempt by the UC Social Space Task Force to raise funds to purchase a space in the Square—made the renovations to the SOCH so urgent in the first place. It is sobering to compare the enhancements such as disco lights and subwoofers with the factors that make more popular party spots a success. However, the SOCH seems to be having some  success; the SOCH’s number of room reservations and bookings have increased by 35%. Perhaps, the renovations will have a lasting effect on this uptick in popularity.
SOCH MORNING AFTER
We had places to party on campus long before the SOCH was renovated. What we didn’t really have were many places to meet with friends the morning after to regale them with stories of bad decisions or unexpected turnouts from the night before.
“We wanted to make [the SOCH] a kind of space we don’t currently have on campus; a flexible social space,” Bicknell says. Indeed, we do currently have plenty of party space on campus, be it a student suite, a Greek house, a final club, or a student group building. The SOCH doesn’t need to be a party space, because it so clearly has other benefits; the lounge could resemble anything from a cushy café to a welcoming study area to an extended and updated living room.
It is hard to envision the SOCH hosting a large number of wild parties, but that does not undermine its other benefits. It could have a unique place in the fabric of undergraduate lives. And a lack of revelry will at least keep the walls cleaner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Does life go on? It does,” T. C. Boyle writes in his latest novel “San Miguel.” This simple truth unites two families in Boyle’s fictionalized world of San Miguel, an island off the coast of California. The first family is made up of Marantha Waters, her irascible husband Will, and their adopted daughter Edith, who all arrive on the island in 1888. By 1930, the Waters family has come and gone, and the island is occupied by newlywed couple Elise and Herbie Lester. Each family has their own illnesses and scandals to contend with, and through it all they must struggle to find ways of getting their lives to “go on,” through events both mundane and catastrophic. If the reader is willing to forgive a few insufficiently fleshed-out characters and occasionally sluggish pacing, Boyle’s vivid narration and his ability to forge connections between the main characters and the reader make it an overall worthwhile read.
The subject matter in Boyle’s 14th novel focuses on familiar material, especially a natural environment, as his other works. Boyle is adept at writing passages on nature and the elements; in “San Miguel” he describes “the salt tang of the ocean rushing in on the wind” or “the cliffs falling away into the churn of the sea.” These descriptions help fully immerse the reader in the setting of the novel.
Boyle’s focus on familial relationships, as well as his penchant for showing families in the same location over different time periods, is a tactic he used to great effect in his novel “World’s End.”  Here, too, he excels at scrutinizing the interactions of husbands and wives; the differences between the Lester and Waters family are used well to emphasize what has changed and remained in the American zeitgeist between 1888 and 1930.
While the thematic content of the novel is largely material that Boyle has explored before, the narrative unfolds in a different pattern. “San Miguel” represents Boyle’s first foray into a third person narration in the realist style as opposed to using the postmodern narrative techniques that have marked his past works. One notable quality of the novel is its slow pacing. There are long portions of Marantha’s and Elise’s stories during which very little occurs to move along the plot. Instances like these are narrative lulls, with pages of characters engaging in repetitive interactions, or storms raging and subsiding in predictable patterns.
Boyle, however, seems to be aware of this. His story itself makes reference to the fact that the characters experience long uneventful stretches of time with nothing happening. It appears, therefore, that Boyle deliberately crafted the pace of the novel in this manner to mirror the pace of the characters’ lives on the island. This may have the effect of allowing the reader to better understand the characters’ lives; alternately, it may alienate them by making the book more difficult to read.
The book is split into three parts, each of which is a fairly straightforward narrative of the life of Marantha, Edith, or Elise. When the book follows aspiring actress Edith, Boyle peppers the story with references to theatre, as when Edith describes a woman who “could have played one of the weird sisters in Macbeth, and without a wig or a touch of greasepaint either.” The portion of the novel that features Elise, an ardent Francophile, has French phrases weaved throughout; in the kitchen she uses “fines herbes,” and one nightmare of a day is described with the equivalent French word “cauchemar.” The subtle uses of particular turns of phrase and euphemisms to describe the world around each featured character allow the reader to become intimatelyw familiar with the central characters, the way they think, and the way they perceive their environment.
Unfortunately, the laser-focus Boyle holds on the three central women causes him to neglect the development of some of the other compelling characters. For instance, the 19th century Waters family employs a young African-American man named Jimmie to help take care of the sheep. Over the course of the story, Jimmie’s relationship with the members of the family becomes fascinatingly complicated. Yet Boyle dedicates very little time to exploring his worldview. In his largest chunk of dialogue, Jimmie tells the Lester family some of the exploits that Edith Waters had after leaving the island. What could have been a promising character thus becomes little more than a narrative device.
Another member of the Waters household is their cheerful housekeeper, Ida. Though Ida becomes deeply entangled in the family’s affairs in significant ways, similarly scant attention is paid to her. It is difficult not to feel as if the author has wasted potential in Ida and Jimmie. He involves them in the story just enough for them to be more than peripheral characters and to generate interest, but he keeps them at such a distance that the promise of these characters feels unfulfilled.
Despite Boyle’s disappointing exploration of a few of his characters, “San Miguel” is an engrossing novel. His attention to detail, talent for bringing the reader close to his characters, and lush descriptions of the island itself make the novel an entertaining read.  Boyle creates an impressively intricate literary world on the island of San Miguel, and his artful prose is more than enough to take readers to that island with “the sheep grazing, the waves rolling on the shore and pulling back again.”

Achieving literary fame at a young age is frequently elusive. Once the hype surrounding a triumphant first novel fades, the literary world will look to its author with expectation, eager to see if genius will strike again or if the first book was simply a fluke. No matter what the quality of a new work, authors will always remain in the shadow of their first novel, as writers like Jay McInerney and Brett Easton Ellis know all too well.
London writer Zadie Smith certainly fits the literary darling model. She won the hearts of critics and readers alike with her 2000 debut “White Teeth,” which she finished during her final year as an undergraduate at Cambridge University. The punchy voice and teenage protagonists of “White Teeth” spoke for a new generation of Brits by capturing the gritty reality of an unrefined London.
In the intervening years since she burst into the literary world, the now 37-year-old Smith has brought her own maturation directly into her writing. She’s written tales of teenage woe for the ultimately disappointing chronicle of a down-and-out collectibles trader in 2002’s “The Autograph Man,” and a saga of two intertwined families of academics in 2005’s well-received “On Beauty.” Similarly, Smith’s latest novel, “NW,” takes aging as its theme and follows its four protagonists—Natalie, Leah, Felix, and Nathan—as they navigate the perils of adulthood in the internet age. The four characters, who range from a wealthy barrister to a homeless druggie, are united only by the place they grew up—Caldwell, a northwest London council estate (a British term for public housing).
Although “NW” purports to be a description of the growth of four Caldwell individuals, it hardly divides itself into four neat sections. Smith instead decides to focus on the 30-year friendship between the self-invented, successful Natalie Blake and the gangly dreamer Leah Hanwell. Smith’s unique voice emerges when she exposes her panoramic vision of this friendship; she manages, in a succinct paragraph, to show Natalie and Leah’s progression from childhood innocence to typical teenage debauchery. “Together they ran, jumped, danced, sang, bathed, colored-in...shared chips, sneaked  cigarettes, read Cheryl’s diary, wrote the word FUCK on the first page of a Bible, tried to get ‘The Exorcist’ out of the video shop, watched a prostitute or loose woman or a girl just crazy in love suck someone off in a phone box...did the moonwalk, learned the obscene dance popularized by Salt-N-Pepa, and many other things of this nature.” The girls’ friendship emerges through the background of their maturing interests; in one brief description, Smith’s impressionistic language manages to convey their bonding, growth, and emerging personalities.
Natalie and Leah, however, have come a long way from their council estate days. “NW” opens on a Leah in her mid-30s. She still embodies the pot-loving, free spirit of her teenage self, except for one crucial, and clichéd, difference: her biological clock is ticking. When we first meet Leah she has learned that, to her embarrassment and disappointment, she is pregnant. Perhaps this unfortunate discovery is what leads her to open the door of her house to a struggling young woman. The woman, Shar, claims that her mother is extremely ill and asks Leah for cab money, which Leah readily gives after she realizes that they attended the same high school. “Leah is as faithful in her allegiance to this two-mile square of the city as other people are to their families, or their countries. She knows the way people speak around here, that fuckin, around here, is only a rhythm in a sentence.” While Leah’s loyalty to her home blinds her to what is ultimately exposed as the scheme of a hapless crack addict, the incident drives Leah out of her funk and forces her to re-examine her post-Caldwell life from the eyes of the struggling adult that she has become.
“NW” finds its strength in its third section, its longest and undeniably most innovative part. Here the novel shifts focus from Leah to Natalie and follows her throughout her transformation from the intensely religious and nerdy Keisha Blake to self-styled Natalie Blake, a wealthy and competitive barrister. Although Smith risks an overly simplified plot in this oft-used theme of re-invention, her interesting breakdown of the third section into 185 choppy, titled mini-sections saves the reader from the boredom of reading a straightforward account of one woman’s upward mobility. With snarky titles like “That obscure object of desire” (an allusion to Luis Buñel’s 1977 film of the same name) and “50ml vodka,” the sections weave plenty of pop culture references and London slang into its continuing narrative of friendship and newly acquired adulthood, chronicling simultaneously the growth of the two friends and the advance of a generation.
“Some days have a depressing thematic coherence,” Smith tells the reader, but what is depressing about “NW” is its occasional lack thereof. The novel’s second section moves to follow Felix, a former drug addict and present mechanic, who also hails from Caldwell. Felix’s story, while engrossing, provides narrative discontinuity; Smith plops it into the middle of the novel and never returns to it. This 100-page lapse between Leah and Natalie’s sections is disjointing. Themes as disconnected as impending motherhood, newly found wealth, drug addiction, and unnecessary murder expose a lack of coherence; common location guarantees neither a common understanding of the world nor a similar way of progressing through it.
With “NW,” Zadie Smith has distanced herself from the youthful exploits she wrote about in “White Teeth;” she instead uses her new novel to imagine the progression of members of the same generation into their 30s. Her witty voice and infusion of pop culture, however, help “NW” retain a similar flavor to her older works and shows that time and success do not necessarilly obliterate an innovative literary voice. Perhaps Smith’s writing can be compared to her characters, who, even as they achieve success in their relationships and professions, can never completely shake their roots. “The mistake was to think that the money precisely signified—or was equivalent to—a particular arrangement of bricks and mortar,” Smith writes. “The money was not for these poky terraced houses with their short back gardens. The money was for the distance the house put between you and Caldwell.” Smith’s first novel “White Teeth” is a virtual Caldwell, a presence that continues, despite the passage of time, to uniquely color her writing. “NW,” despite some inconsistencies, is a welcome installment in Smith’s collection of innovative, incisive prose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I mentioned the Oakland setting of “Telegraph Avenue” to my father—born and raised in the Bay Area—he asked me if there was a corrupt overlord-esque City Councilman and a zoning battle. Bingo. Michael Chabon, best known for his over-imaginative Brooklyn-based protagonists in “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay,” has flipped to the opposite side of the country for a romanticized portrayal of 2004 Oakland. Record store owners Nat Jaffe and Archie Stallings are the beleaguered hold-outs against media conglomerate Gibson Goode, but the fight between Goode and Brokeland Records isn’t the forte of “Telegraph Avenue.” Rather, Nat and Archie’s wives Gwen and Aviva, who work as midwives to the “60/40 boho to bougie” Bay Area population, show that Chabon can write complex female characters well without relying on the crutch of over-powering them. But the most admirable triumph of “Telegraph Avenue” is Chabon’s ability to write a novel—whose visceral descriptions are more akin to a movie—without the exposition sounding like a raw screenplay, lending a fantastical air and a level of palpable emotional depth.
The novel is styled as an album that is broken down into five “tracks” that serve as long chapters; each chapter has a different mood and focus as it skips wildly between three generations and the various exploits of these characters. Archie and Nat desperately try to keep Brokeland Records open while Archie’s itinerant father Luther Stallings looms large above every action. Gwen and Aviva fight their own battle for the right to midwife. And on the youngest tier is Archie’s illegitimate son Titus, who becomes friends with, and eventually the lover of, Nat’s quiet son Julie—lovingly described as “twenty-five minutes to gay o’clock.”
At its heart, the book is styled to be a slightly dampened Tarantino flick. There’s a delightful Chinese kung fu master named Irene Jew, whose martial arts expertise and ferocious temper would easily place her in one of his films. The dialogue between Luther Stallings and Chan Flowers (the slightly unscrupulous councilman) and Nat and Archie often resembles that between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in “Pulp Fiction,” with catty references to scientific concepts and the generic category of weird trivia. Body parts are shot off, dramatic encounters with food ensue—think Hans Landa’s love affair with milk—and most notably, State Senator Barack Obama appears to interact with Gwen at a bar in a gloriously surreal scene. However, where Chabon differs is the humanity with which he portrays Gwen and Aviva. During one of their more difficult births, Chabon writes a lovely interaction between the two women: “The defeated look was gone in an instant, smuggled off, hooded and manacled, to the internal detention facility where Aviva Roth-Jaffe sent such feelings to die.”  Instead of Tarantino’s unreadable femme fatales, who often exist as a sex challenge against the males, the two women are depicted as human beings who are strong and yet still human.
One of Chabon’s greatest technical strengths has always been a tendency to park each sentence in an unpredictable spot—a style reminiscent of John Updike, which keeps the reader entertained when the characters are just waiting for something to happen. However, while this worked for “Kavalier & Clay,” in which the protagonists were hyped-up young adults who came up with wild comic book plot lines for a living, it seems a bit more contrived when the characters are older and world-weary. After developing Archie as a sort of desperate character who obsesses over cream cake and clenches his wife’s body pillow in a vice grip, Chabon’s attempt to create dynamic lines about the character’s “heart tipping over, falling from its shelf” become overused and thus stale. In some parts, he begins to rely solely on these brief segues from the action, which leads to an absurd string of sentences in the form, “He looked as if...” or “It was somewhere between...” in an unrelated line of attempts to try to describe the world anew instead of more effectively fleshing out dialogue. In some parts, he even seems to be parodying this technique by including long paragraphs of block description followed by a desperately unenlightening “Huh!” from either Archie or Gwen.
In this way, it appears that Chabon is trying to make a TV show like “Scrubs,” with constant segues to absurd scenes happening in the characters’ imaginations rather than a smooth, holistic narrative. When the third chapter is told solely from the view of a parrot flying over the city in sequence that Werner Herzog (who also gets several shout-outs in the book) would probably love to shoot, it becomes a bit confusing as to whether this is a movie, a TV show, an album, or what it actually is-—a book.  External dialogue is substituted for weird musings that are shared 50-50 between narrator and character. The more memorable scenes present themselves in a Tarantino guns-a-blazin’ way that would be best for screen, but the physical descriptions of a resplendently pregnant Gwen are best described in prose, and yet the saga of her struggles and those around her are serialized like a TV show.  Usually, these characteristics would be indicative of any well-written novel, but with all of the references to cinema and television as well as deviation in form like in the parrot scene, it approaches instead a strange twilight zone between four types of media that lends it a completely new form entirely. “Telegraph Avenue” is not only a movie that opens up on the jasmine trees of Berkeley and flies through conflict after conflict, but also a well-writen TV show where the audience is equally invested in all of the characters, and yet again a technically wonderous novel whose clever, quippy sentences keep  the reductionist level safe, and most importantly, an album that moves smoothly from one idea to the next before a gentle, clicking stop.

This semester, Harvard College students were greeted by a number of welcome changes to residential dining hall menus, including soymilk dispensers, ingredient listings for all dishes, and “less-meat Mondays,” a new initiative that will offer two vegetarian entrées on Mondays rather than one. Harvard University Dining Services should be applauded for responding so effectively to student demand: If the quickly-vanishing soymilk is any indicator, students are taking full advantage of the new options offered to them by HUDS. The recent dining hall changes not only meet student demand for a greater diversity of foods, but they also promote healthier and more sustainable eating habits.
It is no secret that animal-based foods, particularly meat, are substantially more harmful to the environment than plant-based foods. Animal-based foods require many times more resources per calorie to produce than plants, and the United Nations has noted that a global shift to a meat- and dairy-free diet will be necessary to mitigate the devastating impacts of climate change. A growing body of scientific research also suggests that meat-heavy diets are as nutritionally questionable as they are environmentally harmful. HUDS’ expanded vegetarian options and soymilk dispensers are thus not just beneficial to vegetarians. A reduced dependence on animal-based foods helps all students protect the Earth, eat more healthfully, and expand their palates.
New ingredient listings in dining halls provide students with important information about the food that they eat. While HUDS has long provided ingredients and nutrition facts on its website, locating ingredient lists right next to entrées will mean that students will be much more likely to read them before selecting a dish. Students who eat in dining halls often know little about how their food is prepared, and the new ingredient cards are an important step in making information about food and nutrition more transparent. All students should be entitled to accessible information about what they eat.
Also of note is that a number of students, including an unofficial student organization called the Sustainable Food Project, began conversations with HUDS in the last several years about the quality and sustainability of its food. While it is impossible for now to say whether student advocacy played a role in the recent dining hall changes, there is no doubt that these changes have come at a time when members of the Harvard community have expressed an increased interest in food quality and production. We applaud HUDS for taking note of that trend, and we hope that Dining Services continues to experiment with new, more sustainable, and good-tasting foods.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This summer, from June to August, cable stations picked up stories of mass killings from across America. From rural Colorado to the doorstep of the Empire State Building, pervasive violence left no community unscathed. Presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney offered words of condolences but few proposals to rein in this violence. Neither candidate mentioned the issue in his speech at their party’s convention; neither has any plans to change the status quo. In a nation with more guns than any other, now is the time to consider this country’s most taboo political issue.
Our nation has a history of famous shootings. Progressive leaders like Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King, Jr. were assassinated by men who held their beliefs in contempt. John F. Kennedy ’40 wasn’t the only President to be gunned down; six occupants of the Oval Office have been shot. Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who shot Kennedy, mailed off a twenty-dollar bill and in returned received the weapon he used to kill his President. Rep. Gabrielle D. Giffords (D-Arizona) was severely wounded 18 months ago in a shooting spree that killed six and injured 13.  
Mass shootings are not a trend unique to the summer of 2012. According to Craig R. Whitney, writing in the New York Times, 30,000 Americans die each year from gun violence, and an additional 200,000 are injured by weapons. For every 100 Americans, there are 90 guns available for purchase on the open market. While the Second Amendment allows citizens to bear arms, the ready availability of an AR-15—the civilian equivalent of the standard military assault rifle and the weapon used in the Aurora shootings—goes beyond our Founders’ intent. Claiming weapons like these are needed for hunting is intellectually dishonest, and claiming that they are needed for protection is even less believable.
What we need is not a complete ban on weaponry but a discussion on the merits of gun control in a country where nobody will talk about it. The nature of an election-based political system in which third-party lobbying interests hold disproportionate influence has made this impossible. To curry his party’s favor, Mitt Romney has transformed from a man who passed a permanent assault weapons ban in Massachusetts to one whose website claims “he will fight the battle on all fronts to protect and promote the Second Amendment.” Obama went from supporting renewal of the Clinton ban on semiautomatic weapons as a candidate to a President who in office has expanded the rights of gun carriers—allowing guns on Amtrak trains and in national parks. With the National Rifle Association the leading Washington lobbying organization, controlling assets worth well north of $250 million dollars, politicians are wary to bring up the issue of gun control.
Pro-gun rights activists argue that increased carrying of weapons would have stopped killings like Aurora. They suppose that people in the theater could have shot the attacker before so many were killed. However, in a dark space with minimal visibility, who is to say a second attacker would not have caused more carnage? How many more would have been caught in the crossfire? How would people distinguish between a man trying to save them and an accomplice of the killer? The idea that Americans should carry their weapons everywhere for protection—even to watch a midnight premiere of a movie—instead of discussing the merits of gun control is irrational. The Associated Press reported that the weapons used in the Aurora shootings, the aforementioned assault rifle, a shotgun, a bulletproof vest, and 6,000 rounds of ammunition, required no licenses on the part of the buyer. Only the weapons required a background check, one that does not even require a waiting period for the purchase.
I don’t mean to say that there is no merit to owning a weapon, because self-protection is a serious issue and the Second Amendment is a strong part of American history. Hunting and catching game are, as Obama says, “part of a cherished national heritage”. But the argument that pistols don’t offer enough stopping power for protection, and that those without licenses should be able to purchase assault rifles, goes beyond discussing self-protection and creates issues of civilian safety. That gun manufacturers don’t always check for mental competency and criminal records is a public safety risk.
Sensationalist media reporting on some killings is not enough. The same day as the Empire State Building Massacre, 19 citizens were killed in Chicago, many of them youths. The time is now to discuss gun violence in this country. It is a discussion that isn’t about the Second Amendment; it’s a discussion about public safety. It is a discussion with tremendous social implications; it is a discussion we cannot push off. To stay quiet here is, quite appropriately, silent but deadly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Success for a woman in corporate or political life is often chalked up to some combination of "personal determination” and “personal sacrifice.” The popular rhetoric of Sheryl K. Sandberg '91 speaks to this: her commencement address at Barnard exhorted women to overcome an “ambition gap” and advised listeners that “the most important career decision you’re going to make is whether or not you have a life partner and who that partner is.” Simplifications such as these have reinforced the tendency for Americans to view gender inequality as a special interest issue, something that only women need to think about. In addition, they have led to a lack of discussion concerning how each citizen must play a role in making equal opportunity in the workplace a reality in the United States.
Anyone who wishes to pursue true gender equality must not only champion reproductive rights, but must also oppose the many systemic problems throughout America’s economy and society which affect women’s professional lives. Current workplace norms of career structure embody destructive value judgments dating back to the era of separate spheres. We must challenge these socio-economic structures, and the assumptions that underlie them, if we want to achieve equal opportunity in the workplace.
Robert O. Self, a professor of history at Brown University, recently wrote in the New York Times about how issues of gender equality and economic policy are inseparable. How society views gender, and turns its conceptions into law, is a crucial part of the social contract that also underlies our economy. As he puts it, this year’s election is about how “the economy and the culture wars…collapse together.” Efforts to reshape women’s place in the United States are not some niche issue. They are a greater struggle over “the basic architecture of our collective responsibility to ensure that Americans share in a decent life.”
Self is correct when he describes how “in the candidates’ views of women we catch a glimpse of how we will write the social contract over the next generation.” But America’s condition of gender inequality is not merely a byproduct of laws concerning child-care, sex education, and abortion rights.
Familial and corporate structures, and the values underlying them, simultaneously work to determine gender’s place within the social contract. Changing unequal socio-economic systems and their underlying assumptions isn’t as simple as passing laws.
Perhaps it is not what is “in the candidates’ views of women,” but what is outside of our political discourse—what is simply accepted “as is”—which plays the greatest role in determining the future of gender equality in our country.
Anne-Marie Slaughter, former Director of Policy Planning at the State Department, explored the systemic nature of gender inequality, writing recently in The Atlantic about how women can not “have it all…with the way America’s economy and society are currently structured.” Her wide-ranging examination maps a complex network of outdated perceptions embedded within political, corporate, and familial culture. She excellently points out how the typical American notion of work/life balance is skewed. As she notes, “workers who put their careers first are typically rewarded; workers who choose their families are overlooked, disbelieved, or accused of unprofessionalism.”
These outdated perceptions matter because they continue to manifest themselves in workplace norms, schedules and contracts—all of which create glass ceilings and reinforce notions of sacrifice and dependence on spousal choice, such as those voiced by Sandberg. Slaughter is correct in noting that “it is society that must change, coming to value choices to put family ahead of work just as much as those to put work ahead of family.” Being of any gender in the United States should not entail trade-offs between professional and family life.
Our country has a complex case of gender inequality. It is caused, in part, by our eagerness to cast success as a purely individual endeavor, unrelated to societal standards—to declare that placing a high value upon family is tantamount to embracing an “ambition gap.” In order to change as deep-seated a societal defect as gender inequality, far-reaching legislation concerning workplace contracts may be useful, but insufficient. This is change that must also occur from the bottom-up.
We can, and should, advocate that any college or company we are a part of follow the lead of private bodies like Princeton, and adopt career tracks which mandate equivalent policies of track extension or workload relief for employees of any gender with new-born children. We can, and should, advocate for open and honest discussion about the fallacious use of “face-time” as a measure of workplace commitment.
But, most crucially, each of us must challenge our own assumptions: about the part we play in defining the social contract, and about the value of time spent with family as compared to the value of time spent at work.

For many Harvard students, Johannesburg is a place to change planes en route to other destinations in southern Africa. Quite frequently, foreigners associate the city with violence and crime. Even though I was living in Johannesburg for a month this summer, I felt like I didn’t really get to see the city. A friend and I had returned to the city after a long weekend in Cape Town. He had a four-hour layover between landing in Johannesburg and departing for Harvard, and we decided to spend that time getting a crash tour in the economic hub and third largest city in Africa.
“Johannesburg has a black cloud hanging over it; it is not a ‘preferred’ destination,” Milady Tshandu, manager of African Eagle Johannesburg Day Tours explains. “The idea of the day tours started during the World Cup because we saw that people wanted to do more in the city. Johannesburg is the economic powerhouse of Africa, and it’s trying to rid itself of the images of the 80s and 90s.”
The tour seeks to provide people with the most comprehensive experience and views of the most vibrant parts of Johannesburg in the short hours people would spend killing time in the airport in-between flights.
Our guides picked us up at the airport at noon. We started on Mundro Drive, which offers a panoramic view of the city. Noting the lush vegetation covering the city, our guide Hlowante pointed out that Johannesburg used to be a savanna and has little air pollution because of the tree-planting initiative.
We stopped by the Fort, built by Paul Kruger in 1896, to protect the South African Republic from British invasion. Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and members of the African National Congress were arrested there at different times in the last century. It now serves as the Constitutional Court of South Africa.
Immediately after The Fort, Tshandu pointed out the Miner Statue, signifying the discovery of gold in Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery sparked a mass influx into the city, and for this, Johannesburg is the only large city whose location wasn’t determined because of a large water supply. Currently, 20 percent of the national gross domestic product comes from mining.
Our last stop within the city limits was Muti House, a traditional medicine store. “Around 20 percent of South Africans still believe in it,” Hlowante noted. We stepped into the dimly lit store and were instantly hit with the sight of bones and animal skins dangling from the ceiling. When asked if she could make me a love potion, the woman behind the counter nodded but warned, “if you weren’t raised with the knowledge of this kind of medicine, you won’t understand it or appreciate its powers.”
Leaving the city center, we passed Gandhi Square, commemorating the Indian leader’s 20 years in South Africa. Though Gandhi is known for peaceful activism on a large-scale, Hlowante told us of one of his lesser-known points of persuasion. “Right there, at Alexandra Restaurant, he used to stand outside and petition people to become vegetarians.”
After an hour in Johannesburg proper, we headed to Soweto, South Africa’s largest township at 1.3 million people.
We ate a traditional lunch of pap, mqushu, pumpkin, and mogodu at Sakhumzi Restaurant, located next to Archbishop Desmond Tutu’s house. The Archbishop can often be seen walking with the youth of the township. After lunch we passed Nelson Mandela’s house. Mandela later donated the house to the Soweto Heritage Trust.
Up the road from Mandela’s house was where Hector Pieterson was killed. Pieterson was only 13 when he was fatally wounded by police officers in 1976, and his death is considered the first of the Youth Movement, a period between 1976-1977 during which police officers killed 600 students who peacefully protested the government decision to change the medium of instruction in schools from English to Afrikaans.
Each year on June 16, students take to the streets and congregate here to honor the legacy of those whose lives were lost in the movement.
“When I was growing up in Soweto,” Hlowante recalls, “I remember being afraid to go to school because of the police,” he paused. “Can you imagine, running from the people whose job was supposed to be to protect you?”
After our whirlwind four-hour tour, we headed back to the airport so my friend could catch his flight.
“The people who live here understand and appreciate the beauty of Johannesburg,” Tshandu stated. “This is just a glimpse of what makes our city so great.” It was a wonderful overview of the city and people—and one that might entice people to spend a little more time here during their next layover.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On what was supposed to be the first full day of campaigning for the Undergraduate Council’s general election, the Election Commission announced sweeping disciplinary action against every candidate running as part of the newly formed Crimson Coalition. According to the Commission, the Coalition violated two campaigning rules by publishing an op-ed in The Crimson Monday morning.
The disciplinary action, which consists of 12- and 24-hour campaign suspensions, came after the Crimson Coalition published an open letter in Monday’s Crimson.
“The rule is you are not allowed to campaign in any form before Monday at noon,” said Election Commission Chair Elston He ’13.
He said that the Commission had warned Samuel F. Wohns ’14, a Crimson Coalition leader, not to publish the letter on Sunday afternoon. “The Crimson op-ed was published this morning, which is a clear violation of the campaign rules.”
According to the letter, the Coalition hopes to use the UC “as a tool to build student empowerment.”
The group, consisting of current and aspiring UC members, plans to implement an issue-based referendum process, expand the Forum for Change, and work for the addition of student members to the Harvard Corporation and other University governing bodies.
“With a renewed mentality, we can align the present role of the UC with Harvard’s storied history of student activism and empowered student government,” reads part of the open letter, entitled “We Are the Crimson Coalition.”
The Commission ordered a 24-hour ban on all campaigning for Wohns and the three authors of the Coalition’s open letter—Chloe G. Veron ’14, Larson C. Ishii ’15, and Zaki Djemal ’15. Nine other Coalition members, who signed an online copy of the letter, were also slapped with 12-hour bans. All suspensions went into effect at 7:00 p.m. Monday night, according to a Monday afternoon email from the Election Commission to the candidates and the UC’s email list.
“We apologize for the violation,” Djemal said. “We were hoping that this article was going to be published later on. We did not try to violate the regulations of the UC Election Commission.”
According to Wohns, when the Coalition found out late Sunday that the op-ed could not be published in the afternoon, the three signatories decided to print in Monday’s paper.
Djemal said that the Coalition had hoped to generate buzz and increase voter engagement on the first day of campaigning.
He did not see the election commission’s punishment as being in any way political.
“I think the [EC] is doing their job professionally in this case,” he said. Djemal declined to comment further until his suspension expires.
This year, a total of 96 candidates are running for 43 open seats. In the most contested race, thirteen freshmen candidates from Oak Yard are battling for only three seats.
The Crimson Coalition had hoped to win a 25-seat majority on the council, but only 13 members had signed the Coalition’s letter Monday.
Voting is open from noon on Wednesday to noon on Friday, with results released later that evening, according to the UC website.

For many Allston residents, the devil is in the details.
After a summer during which Harvard made large strides in planning for development across the Charles River, Allston residents said that they are anxious because of the lack of details in the University’s plan, especially concerning the much-discussed Barry’s Corner Housing and Retail Commons.
In the last few months, Harvard brought on a third party developer, Samuels and Associates, to help create the new Barry’s Corner area and announced that the reimagined Allston Science Center will house, among other areas, stem-cell research and bio-engineering facilities.
The University updated residents of its progress at Harvard-Allston Task Force meetings throughout the summer. Ray V. Mellone, an Allston resident and the chairman of the Task Force, praised Harvard’s efforts to keep the community informed on the “overall quality of their thinking”, but said the University’s presentations were not specific and “left a lot to be desired.”
Mellone worried that the proposed Barry’s Corner Complex, as it stands, will not realize the University and the community’s expressed desires to make Barry’s Corner a vibrant and lively community center.
“Right now, it seems generic,” Mellone said. “It doesn’t seem to have a kind of interest for most of the community.”
Barry’s Corner, along with the new Science Complex, has been one of the focal points of University development efforts since Harvard released its first Institutional Master Plan for Allston development in 2007. In that plan, the University aimed to make Barry’s Corner a vibrant community center which would attract locals from both sides of the Charles River. However, plans for Allston development were put on hold in 2009 in the wake of the recent financial crisis. The halt left a huge hole on the plot where Harvard once envisioned a $1 billion science complex devoted to stem cell research—a decision which sparked tension between Harvard and the community.
Task Force member Harry E. Mattison echoed Mellone’s anxiety about the University’s lack of concrete plans for Barry’s Corner.
He hoped the University would re-engage with the idea of creating some sort of cultural center, an idea which, Mattison says, the community strongly supports.
“Harvard for years talked about there being some major cultural institution or activities,” Mattison said. “We want that. If it’s a CVS, a bank, and an AT&T store, it’s not going to be a place people want to come to—it’s not going to be a particularly attractive draw.”
Harvard’s Associate Vice President for Public Affairs and Communications Kevin Casey emphasized that the University’s goals are in line with the community’s.
“Harvard shares the community’s interest in enlivening Barry’s Corner,” Casey wrote in an emailed statement, unable to be reached by phone because he was out of the office. “The master planning process introduced a range of potential future uses in Barry’s Corner that will help to enliven the area, increase pedestrian activity, and further knit together the University and the community.”
Chief Planner Kairos Shen of the Boston Redevelopment Authority, the city body which will decide this fall whether Harvard can pursue its new master plan, could not be reached for comment on Monday.
Task Force member John Cusack, who was one of two Allston residents selected by the University to help choose a developer for Barry’s Corner, was optimistic about the future of the planning process.
“I think they’re trying to work with the needs and requests of the community,” Cusack said. “We’re starting to see at least some ideas of looking for things that the community wants.”
Mattison said that to address the current issues causing anxiety in the community, the nature of the conversations between residents and the University would have to change.
“Right now, the discussion is focused almost exclusively on the height and shape of the buildings,” he said. “If Barry’s Corner is going to become a lively vibrant place, there are a lot of other things that are much more important than how tall and how wide the buildings are.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Police Department has been working in conjunction with the Cambridge Police Department this semester to increase policing during the weekends around the University campus.
After rumors abounded of a police crackdown during the first two weekends of the semester and students reported greater numbers of police officers patrolling Mt. Auburn Street last weekend, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano and CPD spokesperson Daniel M. Riviello officially confirmed the increased police presence in and around Harvard Square in an emailed statement to the Crimson.
Catalano and Riviello explained that “Harvard University Police Department has been taking a more visible and proactive stance on weekend nights during the early part of this semester.”
According to the statement, HUPD requested CPD assistance due to “jurisdictional issues.”
HUPD does not have jurisdiction over any property-owning student organizations unaffiliated with the College, such as the final clubs and fraternities, which are popular destinations for students on weekend nights.
Catalano and Riviello said that the two police departments have always had, and continue to have, a close working relationship and are now striving to address “off-campus behavior reportedly involving Harvard University students and their visitors.”
The statement specifies that this presence applies particularly to “situations involving alcohol use.”
In a separate email to the Crimson, Riviello wrote that the recent increase in police presence is not a response to student infractions. Rather, he explained, the move is part of an effort to better safeguard student safety, particularly with regard to alcohol consumption. He added that the Cambridge Police Department has not yet made any student arrests this year.
“Our presence this year is of a more proactive nature, rather than being reactive and responding to calls for service and other issues,” he wrote.
According Riviello, it is unclear whether or not the increased policing will be a permanent fixture of Harvard nightlife for the rest of the semester.
The statement issued by Catalano and Riviello acknowledges police presence “on weekend nights during the early part of the semester,” but does not comment upon the duration of increased police presence on Harvard campus.

For the nine Harvard College students participating in the Army Senior Reserve Officer Training Corps, the University’s decision to offer physical training exercises on Harvard’s campus after a more than 40 year absence shaves a sizable distance off a morning commute to MIT or Tufts. But for those who followed ROTC’s long road back to Harvard’s campus, the symbolic significance cannot be measured in miles.
Army SROTC students from Harvard previously had to commute to MIT or Tufts to attend all of  their tri-weekly physical training practices. Now, more than five months after Harvard officially recognized the program, students from Harvard, MIT, and Tufts attend one of their 6:30 a.m. practices at Harvard’s McCurdy Outdoor Track—which they did for the second time this past Monday.
Lieutenant Colonel Adam T. Edwards, commanding officer for the battalion, said that while University recognition of ROTC was “obviously” symbolically significant, the benefits have also taken tangible form.
“We’ve actually been working with Harvard for years,” Edwards said. “The students used to come to MIT, so this is really just kind of a building on that relationship and ultimately, the physical reality is that it just makes it easier...for the students to take classes on their own school campus.”
Harvard also this semester began offering a military science course for freshmen held in the Student Organization Center at Hilles. Six freshmen joined Army SROTC this year.
Cadets must take one classroom-based military course each semester of their training—a requirement which they previously had to fulfill off-campus, usually through classes at MIT.
According to Edwards, the on-campus military science class, which is being offered on a trial basis, “provides some convenience” for his students.
“Although Hilles is still a little bit removed from maybe some of their classes,” he added.
Will J. K. Scopa ’15, who joined Army SROTC last year prior to the program’s official recognition, said that, overall, this year has not felt dramatically different from last.
Still, Scopa, a Crimson business editor who is one of three sophomores in the program, said that “it’s good for our school to be identified in a positive way with the military.”
And Harvard has received that recognition. A variety of national media outlets, including the Wall Street Journal and Fox News, covered the return of practices to campus. Even on Monday, a week after the first Harvard training exercise, a CNN contingent could be seen on the field.
Army is the second branch of ROTC to be welcomed back to Harvard’s campus. Harvard recognized Naval ROTC in March of 2011, but has yet to do the same for the Air Force.
Captain Steven M. Benke, who heads the MIT, Harvard, and Tufts battalion of NROTC, stressed the importance of Harvard’s history with public service.
“We believe it’s in the University’s interest and in our interest to increase visibility.... It’s very positive that we have a good relationship going forward,” Benke said. “If we look back, you don’t have to look very far to see how important Harvard students have been to the Navy and to the government as a whole.”

All throughout the day on Monday, Nina M. Yancy ’13—a Quincy House resident and social studies concentrator—received emails and text messages from friends congratulating her for her election as the first class marshal for Class of 2013.
“I am definitely honored,” Yancy said. “I have really enjoyed my time at Harvard, so this is an awesome opportunity to give back to the school and the class.”
Yancy is joined by seven other seniors who have been chosen as class marshals for 2013, according to an email sent out Monday morning by the Harvard Alumni Association and the Harvard College Fund.
Scott J. Yim ’13, also a Quincy House resident and a biomedical engineering concentrator, will be second class marshal.
A co-chair of Quincy House Committee, Yim said that he, too, feels fortunate for this opportunity to serve the Harvard community.
“Harvard has opened lots of doors for me and my family,” Yim said. “I am so lucky and excited, and I hope I can do everyone proud.”
Yancy and Yim will head the Senior Class Committee, which will be responsible for planning events for the class throughout the year.
This sense of gratitude was echoed by Class Marshal Margot J. M. Leger ’13, an Eliot resident who hails from Johannesburg, South Africa. Leger said she feels privileged to be able to give back to the community she loves.
“I want to be a part of it for years to come and create a global community,” she said.
This year’s group of class marshals, which includes students who have taken part in activities ranging from the Crimson Key Society and the Undergraduate Council to Expressions Dance Company and the Black Students Association, come from diverse backgrounds and interests.
Everton L. Blair Jr. ’13, another newly elected Class Marshal from Currier House, said he wants to foster a more culturally and socially inclusive community.
“[Being chosen for class marshal] is both a confirmation from my peers, as well as a charge to do the best I can to bring people together for our last year and to make senior year memorable,” he said.
Blair, an applied mathematics concentrator who spent last spring studying abroad, said he was both surprised and excited to find out that he was elected as one of eight class marshals.
According to the announcement sent to the senior class, nearly 1,000 seniors voted in the final round.
In addition to organizing Senior Week, the Senior Class Committee is also charged with finding speakers for Class Day.
Yim said his dream speakers would be Michelle Obama, Ellen DeGeneres, or Jim Yong Kim, while Blair said he hopes the Senior Class Committee will book Jon Stewart, Rachel Maddow, Dave Chappelle, Bill Maher, or Kevin Hart.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A piece of papyrus dating to the fourth century, no bigger than the palm of a hand, provides the earliest and most definitive evidence yet that some early Christians believed Jesus was married, Harvard Divinity School Professor Karen L. King announced at a conference in Rome Tuesday.
The fragment, which King refers to as the ‘Gospel of Jesus’s Wife,’ contains four words in Coptic, an ancient script of Egyptian Christians, that translate to, “Jesus said to them, my wife...” While the statement does not prove that Jesus was married, it does contradict the orthodox Christian belief that Jesus remained unmarried and celibate.
“Christian tradition has long held that Jesus was not married, even though no reliable historical evidence exists to support that claim,” King said in a statement. “This new gospel doesn’t prove that Jesus was married, but it tells us that the whole question only came up as part of vociferous debates about sexuality and marriage.”
The announcement, which was made during a conference of Coptic scholars held across the street from Vatican City in Rome, is expected to reignite an age-old Christian debate over the role of women and married men in religious life.
The Roman Catholic Church, one of the oldest and the largest of Christian denominations, has faced criticism in recent decades because of its policies barring women and married men from priesthood. In defending its position, the Church has long pointed to the four Gospels, which portray Jesus as unmarried and celibate.
The first recorded statement that Jesus was unmarried dates from the second century. Other  so-called gnostic gospels in circulation at this time, that were unrecognized by the Church, claimed that Jesus was indeed married.
King’s finding—which goes on to read, “She will be able to be my disciple”— is expected to prompt more  intense scrutiny of the Church’s position.
“I think it’s going to lead people to delve much more into the early historical evidence and the theologians to ask why did things come out the way they did,” King said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday afternoon.
Princeton University professor Elaine Pagels, an expert on early Christian history, echoed King and said that issues of Church policy often require well-documented historical evidence for argumentation.
“Christian tradition is very conservative and people often think to make any change they have to go back to something ancient, so this might help them do that,” Pagels said.
The fragment’s owner, who has remained anonymous, first approached King in December 2011. She turned to Roger Bagnall, the director of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World in New York, and then Ariel Shisha-Halevy, a Coptic expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, to help authenticate the the papyrus. King later partnered with Princeton University professor AnneMarie Luijendijk to analyze the text.
King said the seven-line text was likely first written in Greek during the mid-to-late second century and then translated into Coptic as Christianity spread to Egypt. She believes the text, though truncated, is likely discussing family and discipleship, an issue of particular interest to early Christians struggling to balance their earthly families with the message of the Gospels.
Though King thinks the fragment is a piece of another larger, lost gospel, other early Christian scholars have questioned the conclusion, saying the fragment could be a non-gospel religious dialogue or the text of a parable within a larger gospel. King said she is cautious about drawing conclusions from the text, and will explore alternative claims and conclusions.
“I find it hard to evaluate the significance of something that is fragmentary at this point,” Pagels said.
King said she plans to publish her findings later this year, but that she and other researchers will continue to authenticate the fragment and explore other possibilities raised by its text.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A weekend of strong winds and false starts ended with middling results for the Harvard sailing team in its second week of competition.
The Crimson sailed in three different regattas on Saturday and Sunday. The women’s team headed north to Dartmouth, placing 13th in the Mrs. Hurst Bowl regatta. Meanwhile, co-ed squads finished 10th at the MIT-hosted Hatch Brown Trophy on the Charles River and fourteenth at the Nevin’s Trophy regatta in Kings Point, N.Y.
“Overall, it was a pretty tough weekend,” Harvard coach Mike O’Connor said. “I’m pleased with the effort of our team, but we need to make sure that we can maintain this level of effort and increase the acuity of our focus on a daily basis.”
O’Connor also noted that the teams’ configurations are still “very much a work in progress.” The young team must adjust this fall due to the absence of All-American crew Sarah Pierson, whose work commitments have forced her to miss weekend regattas. As a result, Harvard has been forced to shuffle its best lineups.
O’Connor emphasized the need to take the season one step at a time.
“Right now, we’re looking at next week.  We need to focus on preparing ourselves as best we can for whatever regattas we have,” O’Connor said. “We don’t have enough experience or talent yet to focus on the big picture; we need to go day by day and really work together as a team before we can focus on some larger goals.”
MRS. HURST BOWL
Hanover’s Mascoma Lake provided some challenges for the Harvard women, as the Crimson finished 13th in the 22-school field with an overall score of 277 points.
On Saturday, the duo of juniors Morgan Russom and co-captain Isabel Ruane opened the regatta on pace for a top-10 finish in Division A as strong breezes swept across the water.  But the pair ended up with 138 points and a 13th place finish after a disqualification on Sunday.
The Crimson’s Division B boat started slow but enjoyed moderate progress throughout the weekend.  The trio of juniors Caitlin Watson, Jacquelyn Cooley, and freshman Sophie Bermudez placed fourteenth in the Division with 139 points.
Meanwhile, thanks to a dominant 40-point performance in Division B, Yale scored 133 overall points to walk away with its fourth regatta title of the young season.  The University of Rhode Island finished atop Division A with 78 points.
HATCH BROWN TROPHY
A group of Harvard co-ed sailors raced on the familiar Charles River to pick up a 10th-place finish in the 18-school Hatch Brown Trophy.
Senior Jason Michas and sophomore Emma Smith came away with Harvard’s sole race victory of the weekend, placing first in the 11th Division B race of the regatta.  After 15 races, the pair finished 10th in the Division B standings with 143 points.
In Division A, sophomore Michael Drumm and junior Alma Lafler combined for 159 points and a 12th-place finish.  The freshman pair of Sydney Karnovsky and Andrew Mollerus collected 157 points for an 11th-place finish in Division C.
On Saturday the team struggled to manage clean starts in unpredictable conditions.
“It was hard racing,” said Karnovsky.  “It was hard to figure out where you wanted to be to catch the right shift.”
NEVIN’S TROPHY
The Crimson also found tough competition off the coast of Long Island.  With 511 overall points, Harvard placed 14th among 20 schools at the Nevin’s Trophy regatta in Kings Point, N.Y.
Sophomores Gram Slattery and Richard Bergsund and junior Alice Kenney tallied 197 points in Division A, good enough for 15th place.  The team struggled to crack the top 10 in races throughout the weekend but produced a strong fourth-place showing in the 16th and final race of the regatta.
Over in Division B, sophomores Brian Drumm, Luke O’Connor, and Bergsund amassed 147 points to collect an 11th-place finish.  A second-place performance in their sixth race tempered a poor start in their first race of the regatta.
Freshman Marek Zaleski manned the single-handed boat for the Crimson in Division C.  Zaleski scored 167 points to place 11th in his solo collegiate debut.
At the top of the leader board, Georgetown cruised to an easy overall victory with 273 total points after notching wins in Divisions A and C.  Brown’s boat placed first in Division B.

Even though the Harvard women’s volleyball team is on a four game losing streak, it has a chance to turn things around as it travels to New Hampshire (6-8) on Tuesday night.
The Crimson (2-7) is coming off a rough weekend at the New England Challenge tournament, losing all three matches without winning a set.
The Wildcats will be the last team before Harvard faces Dartmouth in its Ivy League opener on Friday night.
“We had a tough weekend this weekend playing some good teams from the Boston area,” said sophomore outside hitter Kristen Casey, who ranks first on the team with 99 digs. “But hopefully we can just have a broad time horizon and realize that all these tough matches are going to help us later on when we’re playing in our own league.”
Despite the disappointing start, the Crimson stays positive in light of its situation.
“[Losing has] been tough, but it’s bringing us closer together and helping us to come to rely on each other,” freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace said. “We’ve created new ideas to think about what we need to do next, so I think it’s also a bonding opportunity for our team.”
Since the weekend, Harvard has been focusing on improving what broke down in the tournament, including how to build momentum after being down in a game.
The Crimson has also worked on running conditioning plays in an effort to outpace its opponents.
But Harvard hopes to fix its problems starting from the first whistle.
“We need to focus on having strong starts and coming out with a lot of energy and motivation so that we can get an early jump on our opponents and help us build momentum throughout the game,” Wallace said.
New Hampshire also returned from the road this past weekend with more losses than wins. The Wildcats sole victory of the weekend was a tight, 3-2, match, against Princeton.
The Crimson has beaten the Wildcats in each of the last four seasons. Last year Harvard outlasted the Wildcats in a close match, 25-19, 24-26, 25-21, 17-25, 15-12.
“It was a really tough five-game match, so hopefully we can win again this year,” Casey said. “I know they have some big outside hitters.”
One of the dominant players for New Hampshire is junior co-captain right side Morgan Thatcher, who has a team-high 183 kills, 3.27 per set.
Not far behind Thatcher is freshman outside hitter Tori Forrest and junior right side Destiny Tolliver, who are second (130) and third (129) in kills for the Wildcats’ squad, respectively.
For the Crimson, captain outside hitter Taylor Docter is not only the team leader for moral, but she also leads the team with 77 kills.
“Taylor gets the most sets on our team, and she’s been such a rock for us,” Casey said. “She’s a great captain.”
Wallace has been a key player for Harvard, recording 74 kills and a hitting percentage of .281.
“[Wallace has] been such a good addition to us this year because she’s a super athletic kid who can hit the ball really hard; but, she’s also a great teammate, super humble, and has filled a very prominent role on our team,” Casey said. “We are leaning on her a lot right now. I’ve been really impressed with Kathleen so far—I think the whole team has.”
Junior right side Erin Cooney has also stepped up for the squad, adding 21 kills last weekend for Harvard.
“Erin had a really good weekend last weekend,” Casey said. “She really led us offensively, along with Kathleen Wallace.”
Junior middle blocker Teresa Skelly, who was an integral part of the Crimson’s line up against the Wildcats last year, has been out after she injured her ankle on Saturday, and she will likely sit out Tuesday night’s game as well.
Northeastern is the only team the Crimson and New Hampshire have played in common so far this season, and both teams fell to the Huskies, 3-0.
“We are rooting for each other and trying to stay positive,” Casey said. “We have good senior leadership, and we all get along so well…. We just want to get back out there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To most members of the Harvard football team, three years of being an All-Ivy selection would mark a solid collegiate football career. For senior running back Treavor Scales, there is still more to achieve.
During Saturday’s season opener against the University of San Diego Toreros, he began to deliver for a fourth straight year, running for a career-high 173 yards and two fourth-quarter scores to lead his team to a 28-13 victory at Harvard Stadium.
The win, which was Harvard’s 12th straight in season openers, showed exactly how much is ahead for the football team, specifically for offensive power Scales.
Though Scales has been a major player for the Crimson for the entirety of his career, heavily contributing to last year’s Ivy League Championship team with 816 yards, he felt somewhat unsatisfied with his 2011 performance.
“Last season wasn’t everything that I wanted it to be,” Scales said before Saturday’s game. “I had certain expectations that I didn’t necessarily meet. So this year was a whole new approach as to how I went about preparing for games, how I went about preparing for practice, and how I go about just enjoying every moment of the season.”
Sluggish in the first three quarters, the offense finally rose with strong blocking by senior center Jack Holuba and the offensive line, which allowed Scales’ finesse and tact to shine.
“Those guys have been together for such a long time, we’ve built a rapport,” Scales said. “They continue to get better and better.... It’s great to have an experienced group up front.”
With just nine and a half minutes to go, senior quarterback Colton Chapple began a drive that would lead to the first of two Crimson touchdowns in a five-minute span. First, two completions to junior wide receivers Ricky Zorn and Andrew Berg pushed Harvard to San Diego’s 39-yard line. Then, Scales closed the drive with a series of short rushes to the end zone.The score put Harvard ahead, 21-13. To seal the win, the home team needed simply to retain possession and fend off the Toreros’ offense. But Scales wanted more.
His next touchdown came shortly after, at the 4:27 mark, on a career-high 66-yard charge.
“[Chapple] said, ‘Guys, one first down and we got the game,’” Scales recalled after the game. “And I looked at him in his face and said, ‘No, we’re scoring a touchdown.’”
Scales delivered his promise on the first play of the drive. Running right, Scales saw nothing but green grass ahead of him as the only cornerback in his vicinity had his focus on Berg.
“When it opens up like that you’ve got to take advantage of the opportunity, and as long as we keep that attack mode on as an offense, we’re going to be successful,” he said.
That attack mode will be key as Scales and the Crimson begin Ivy League play next week at Brown. His play this weekend proved that he has the power to electrify his team towards a win, having set multiple personal records in just one game when his team needed a standout performance. Scales averaged 9.1 yards per carry on his 19 carries, a new career-high.
Last season Scales averaged 4.8 yards per carry on 170 rushes and scored eight touchdowns. The backfield stability he provided earned him second team All-Ivy honors.
Even after an impressive junior campaign that ended with a historic win over Yale and an Ivy title, Scales came back and worked to improve his game in the offseason.
“Treavor is preparing to have without a doubt his best season here. His strength has increased a lot.... And obviously, this being his fourth year playing and basically starting, he has a really good grasp of the offense,” senior tight end Kyle Juszczyk said before the game. “He’s not only a great running back, he takes a lot of pride in his pass-blocking abilities out there, just leveling defensive linemen.”
Scales appeared in fine form Saturday, and he will need to be if Harvard is to claim the second straight Ivy championship as projected before the season began.
Coach Tim Murphy showed no doubts that the senior will be able to live up to expectations.
“When healthy, [Scales is] the most complete back in the league and a proven four year player,” he said.
As Chapple echoed, “He can do it all."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a new weekly feature, The Crimson will be tracking the successes (and potential failures) of some of Harvard’s most successful graduates not to use their Harvard degrees. While a tour through professional sports is not exactly a who’s who of Harvard alumni, a few athletes have taken their game to the next level. From Jeremy Lin to Ryan Fitzpatrick, the Crimson maintains a presence outside of the labs and law offices of the world.
Well, it’s that time of year again. School is back in session, fall is in the air, Harvard’s fall sports teams are kicking off and beginning Ivy League play, and the handful of Crimson alumni making it in the big leagues are getting busy.
This past Sunday, Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05 led his Buffalo Bills to a 35-17 drubbing of the Kansas City Chiefs, playing an efficient game, tossing for 178 yards and 2 scores with no interceptions. This marked an improvement for the quarterback, alternately nicknamed “Fitzmagic” and “The Amish Rifle, ” who threw three picks in the Bill’s embarrassing 48-28 first week loss against the New York Jets. Fitzpatrick led the NFL in interceptions last season.
But while the NFL season is kicking into full gear, the NHL season may be grinding to a halt a month before it was even scheduled to begin. Craig Adams ’99, of the Pittsburgh Penguins, and Dominic Moore ’03, a free agent who played with the San Jose Sharks in the 2011-2012 season, and Louis Leblanc, formerly ’13, who put in time with the Montreal Canadiens, will likely be affected by the NHL’s decision Sunday to lock out its players. More recent graduates Alex Biega ’10, Michael Biega ’11, and Alex Killorn ’12 have been playing with NHL-affiliate teams in the AHL and may feel the impact as well. The lockout will be the league’s second work stoppage in eight years and the third of the four major professional sports to lock out its players in the past two years.
But while the hockey players may be out of a job, three former Harvard baseball players are just beginning their careers. We may not boast as many pro athletes as future lawyers and bankers, but three former Crimson baseball players were selected in June’s 2012 MLB Draft. Pitchers Brent Suter ’12 and Andrew Ferreira, formerly ’13, along withinfielder Jeff Reynolds ’12, have since reported to the minor leagues to chase their professional dreams. On Sunday, the lefty Suter earned a save by pitching the last three innings of a win that earned his Wisconsin Timber Rattlers (the Class A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers) the 2012 Midwest League title. Reynolds recently wrapped up his season with the short-season A classification Brooklyn Cyclones, posting a .232 batting average. Ferreira posted a 1.80 ERA in 10 innings this season for the Elizabethton Twins, Minnesota’s rookie-ball club.
Harvard baseball’s earlier classes are also busy making their mark on the pros. Eric Eadington ’11 had a 4-3 record and 3.63 ERA across three levels of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization, ending the season in AA-Chattanooga. He will begin play in the Arizona Fall League next week. Meanwhile, Max Perlman ’11 completed his season for the high-A Stockton Ports and will now be taking his talents to Israel to pitch for its World Baseball Classic qualifier team.

University President Drew G. Faust defended the role of the conservative on Harvard's campus during her appearance on "The Colbert Report" Monday evening. 
Stephen T. Colbert accused Faust of being "one of those smart people who Rick Santorum says that the GOP's never going to attract." He then asked, "Why are you so prejudiced against people who do not value education?"
"We see Harvard as a place for education for people who are conservative, people who are liberal, and everybody in between," said Faust, prompting Colbert to ask if Harvard was also "for dumb people." "It's never dumb to get an education," Faust said. "So you're prejudiced against dumb people," Colbert retorted in response to her diplomatic answer. "It's good to know." 
Following the humorous banter at the beginning, the interview took a largely serious tone. Faust was on the show promoting "Death and the Civil War," a PBS documentary by renowned filmmaker Ric Burns based on her book entitled "The Republic of Suffering." 
The typically comedic Colbert asked questions that led to a generally humorless conversation on the somber subject of the documentary—the impact of the Civil War's unprecedented casualty count on the American people.
"The Civil War brings to the American people a level of death that is unprecedented—that is unlike anything they anticipated or had experienced before," Faust said.
In conclusion to these sobering comments, Colbert added the following thought: "I think this is a fantastic documentary, this sounds like a fascinating book, but you're beginning to make the civil war sound like a downer."
Absent from the five minute conversation were questions about the controversy surrounding alleged cheating at Harvard, a thread which has consumed national media coverage of the University since the story broke at the beginning of the semester.
Her appearance on "The Colbert Report" was one of Faust's final stops on her speaking tour to promote the documentary and her book. "Death and the Civil War" airs on PBS tonight at 8 p.m.

Outside the Inn at Harvard, in the courtyard nested between Harvard St. and Mass. Ave. Should be around for the next few hours.
