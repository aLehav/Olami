After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite forcing a decisive fifth set, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (7-5, 0-2 Ivy) fell to Princeton (9-5, 2-0), 3-2, on Friday night. The Crimson quickly fell behind by two games to the Tigers but came back in the third and fourth sets to level the playing field. The fifth-set effort proved to be insufficient, and Harvard ultimately lost, 25-13, 25-21, 21-25, 23-25, and 15-9.
The Crimson was coming off a defeat by Dartmouth in its opening Ivy League match as well as the loss of its junior setter, Beth Kinsella, who is likely out for the remainder of the season with a hand injury. Sophomore Natalie Doyle, who had only seen playing time on the back row as a defensive specialist, stepped into Kinsella’s position and posted 51 assists in her first match.
After dropping the first two games, Harvard, led by freshman Kristen Casey, regained control of the match. Casey recorded 11 kills in the third set alone and ensured that the Crimson would not be blanked in its second Ivy League matchup. Junior Taylor Docter took the reins in the fourth set, contributing five kills to help Harvard come back from a 16-6 deficit. Docter finally put the Crimson up, 22-21, and posted two of her five kills to seal the set.
Harvard would not have its Cinderella ending, however, as its comeback effort finished with a 15-9 loss in the decisive fifth frame.
Docter had a match-high 18 kills and four blocks, while Casey and sophomore Erin Cooney had 11 and 10 kills, respectively. In addition to her 51 assists, Doyle also contributed 16 digs in the loss.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
EASTON, Pa.—For the second year in a row, the Crimson found itself down to its third-string sophomore quarterback on the road against Lafayette.
And for the second year in a row, that didn’t matter one bit.
A dominant defensive performance highlighted Harvard’s (2-1, 1-0 Ivy) second-straight blowout of the Leopards (1-4, 0-1 Patriot), as the Crimson made a strong statement in a 31-3 win over a team that defeated two-time Ivy League defending champion Penn by 25 points two weeks ago.
“Any time you can win a game on the road against a very solid football team with your third-string QB, you’re very happy,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “I think we played an all-around team effort.”
Last season, then-sophomore third-stringer Colton Chapple—filling in for senior Andrew Hatch ’11 and then-junior Collier Winters—led the Crimson to a 35-10 win over Lafayette at Fisher Stadium.
With Winters missing his second straight game of 2011 with a hamstring injury, Chapple was called upon to start against the Leopards once again on Saturday.
The junior quarterback was extremely efficient in the first half, completing 14-of-18 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. He was at his best with the clock winding down, orchestrating a 10-play, 52-yard touchdown drive in 1:44 at the half’s end.
On that drive, Chapple came up especially clutch on third down, hitting junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk for a 17-yard pickup on a 3rd-and-6 from the Lafayette 48, then connecting with senior wideout Chris Lorditch for a 10-yard gain on 3rd-and-5 from the 26.
After a one-yard rush and illegal shift penalty left the Crimson staring at a 2nd-and-14 from the Lafayette 20, senior receiver Alex Sarkisian dropped a pass that hit him in the chest at the goal line, costing the Crimson a scoring chance.
But Chapple, unfazed, responded on third down by hitting Juszczyk in the flat for 16 yards. On the next play, Sarkisian made up for his earlier drop, catching a fade over Leopards DB Brandon Ellis to put the Crimson up, 17-3, with just three seconds left in the half.
“[Sarkisian] came back and redeemed himself,” Murphy said. “He made a good play ... It was a big momentum builder for us, a big momentum killer for them.”
Chapple only had a chance to lead that drive because of the play of his defense. A strip sack by junior Grant Sickle and a recovery by senior Josue Ortiz had put the ball back in Chapple’s hands with under two minutes to go.
“Harvard’s a very good football team,” Lafayette coach Frank Tavani said. “They play very well. Their D-Line is the big part of it; those guys inside are as good as anybody we’ve played.”
In the locker room at the break, Chapple’s back tightened up, forcing the Crimson to turn to sophomore Michael Pruneau for his first career appearance under center.
Things started slow for Pruneau’s offense to open the second half, as the team went three-and-out without gaining a yard. On the Crimson’s second drive of the period, junior running back Treavor Scales dropped a swing pass in the backfield, and Lafayette recovered the fumble at the Harvard eight.
But at that point, the Leopards began to beat themselves. A holding penalty and a false start took away a Lafayette touchdown and set the squad back to a 3rd-and-goal from the 13. Senior Dan Minamide then easily intercepted a Shoop pass in the end zone—his second straight game with a goalline pick—to keep the Leopards off the scoreboard.
After a three-and-out on its next drive, Harvard sent junior Jacob Dombrowski out to punt. Dombrowski sent away a booming 54-yarder that was fumbled by Leopards returner Darius Safford after a hit from senior captain Alex Gedeon. Juszczyk recovered the fumble, setting Pruneau up with great field position.
“Jake got off a really great punt, a lot of hangtime which allowed me to get down the field,” Gedeon said. “As the returner was coming around I was able to get a hand on the ball and then [Juszczyk] was able to pick it up ... It really all started with Jake.”
After Scales got nowhere on back-to-back runs, Pruneau managed just a short completion to Lorditch on a 3rd-and-14 from the Lafayette 22.
But Leopards linebacker Leroy Butler was called for both roughing the passer and unsportsmanlike conduct on the same play, setting the Crimson up with a first-and-goal from the Lafayette two. Pruneau then rolled out and hit sophomore tight end Cameron Brate off a deflection for the quarterback’s first career TD, putting Harvard up, 24-7.
The defense would hold down the fort from there, stopping the Leopards on a fourth-and-six from the Crimson 25 on Lafayette’s ensuing drive.
The Leopards recorded just 57 total yards in the final quarter, while Harvard freshman running back Zach Boden joined Pruneau with his first career collegiate touchdown on a powerful 43-yard scamper with 2:46 left in the game.
It was the Crimson’s second rushing score of the contest, after Scales gave Harvard a 10-3 lead with a four-yard run 8:20 into the second quarter.
At the end of the match, Lafayette had scored just three points in a contest for the first time since 1990, and the Crimson had held a road opponent without a touchdown for the first time in 24 games.
“I thought we did what we had to do offensively,” Murphy said. “It wasn’t pretty all the time, but if you play hard, and your defense plays that well, you have a chance at least to beat anybody ... today was just our day, it was one of those days.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a day commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 1991 Harvard women’s field hockey team’s Ivy League championship, the Crimson’s alums weren’t the only ones celebrating. Harvard (5-3, 2-1) took a dominant step forward as it crushed Brown (1-8, 0-3) 4-0.
The first major offensive attack came at the 28:48 mark of the first half. After the Bears’ penalty corner shot was blocked, the Crimson launched a counter-attack that took the ball downfield. Freshman Noel Painter sent a quick pass to junior Kim Goh, but the ball escaped its target, and the storm was temporarily weathered.
But with 15:20 left in the half, junior Katelin Wahl dribbled the ball into a tight pack and managed to send off a shot that put Harvard on the scoreboard, 1-0.
Play continued with a slew of penalty corner shots for the Bears that spanned the rest of the first half. While Brown did not take advantage, Crimson coach Sue Caples still emphasized her team’s need to improve in the second half, and improve it did. Despite the penalty corner disparity in the first half, Harvard ended up on top of that category, earning 11 shots to its opponent’s seven.
“I think we battled Brown really hard for 70 minutes,” Caples said. “It took us a half to start getting the results. We should have had more to show for in the first half, but Brown played tough and had a lot of opportunities. Most of them were corners. We need to do a better job of taking care of the ball in the circle, but I think in the second half we made some really good adjustments and controlled things. We were really pleased with the second half performance.”
The second half opened with a Crimson goal after only 18 seconds. It was a shot by Painter, assisted by classmate Catriona McDonald, and it set the pace for the rest of the game.
“I think the run down by Cat in the first 15, 20 seconds was pretty spectacular,” Caples said. “We have a lot of speed out there. Speed is a very dangerous weapon and hard to defend.”
Harvard’s speed allowed it to put increased pressure on the Bears and to tighten up its defense. The Crimson gave Brown fewer shots at the goal as the game went on. And whenever the Bears were able to penetrate Harvard defense, junior goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulos put a clear stop to the drive.
“She’s a rock,” Caples said of her goalkeeper. “Solid, great leadership back there. Big defensively.”
Tassopoulos had 12 saves on the day, leading the defense to its second shutout win of the season.
“Our mentality was to really try to keep them from getting shots,” Tassopoulos said. “They got some, but I think we did a good job of holding our circle and making sure we were mentally tough.”
When faced with a penalty corner and a penalty stroke in succession, Tassopoulos denied the shots and fended off yet another Brown attack.
“I was trying to stay very focused and just watch the ball all the way in ... at that point you just have to hope that we can stop it.”
Amidst the steady defense, the Crimson's offense was not to be outshone. Sophomore Kyleigh Keating knocked a close-range shot into the bottom left corner of the net to increase the Harvard's lead to 3-0 at 53 minutes.
To cap the scoring off, a breakaway led by sophomore Bridget McGillivray and finished off by junior Emma Keller gave Harvard its final goal of the night, completing the score of 4-0.
Caples was very satisfied with the overall effort, noting the consistency of her team at this young point of the season.
“We’re working to put a complete game together,” she said. “We’re really pleased. Great team effort.”
“I think it went really well,” Tassopoulos said. We were able to come out strong and keep the pressure high the entire game and come up with shots at different times.”
After two straight league wins, it appears as if things are starting to mesh for the Crimson. Caples sees the rest of the season in a very positive light.
“We’ll refuel, there’s really good energy. We’re really starting to click and the combinations are starting to feel really good,” Caples said. “One of our big things this year is that we want to be the team setting the tempo out there, and there was a really high tempo set [today] by our forwards.”
Harvard will look to continue its momentum and complete its pair of weekend games on Sunday against the University of Vermont (6-4).
“Vermont is going to be a really good team for us to play,” Tassopoulos said. “We just want to come out and play them as hard as we played today, if not harder.”
If the Crimson continues to play as it did today, perhaps the 1981 team won’t be the only team long remembered.

Sophomore Peyton Johnson put away a shot from the penalty spot in overtime to help the Harvard women’s soccer team (6-4, 2-0 Ivy) down Yale, 2-1, and extend its winning streak to two games in Ivy play.
The Bulldogs (4-4-2, 1-1), hosts of this afternoon’s contest, saw their early first-half lead disappear after Crimson co-captain Melanie Baskind scored the equalizer 14 minutes into the second period. Senior Patricia Yau delivered a cross into the penalty area that the senior Baskind easily put away.
The contest ended regulation in a 1-1 deadlock, and it took just two minutes into overtime for the Crimson to deliver the final blow. Johnson dribbled her way into the 18-yard box and got off a shot that struck a Yale defender in the hand. The referee called the intentional hand ball, which granted Johnson a penalty kick. The second-year player did not hesitate to slip the ball past the goalkeeper and seal the victory for the visiting team.
Harvard outshot the Bulldogs, 12-8, seven of which were on target compared to Yale’s three opportunities on goal.
The Crimson will face Fairfield on Tuesday at Ohiri Field for a nonconference matchup before traveling to Cornell next Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Things just keep getting better for Ryan Fitzpatrick ’05.
After leading his Buffalo Bills to a 3-0 start, the former Crimson quarterback has gone from a player little known outside Harvard Yard and upstate New York to a national media darling in a matter of weeks (as an example, if Fitzpatrick’s Google Trends chart were a polygraph, he would have been accused of recently telling more lies than Pinocchio).
After stunning Tom Brady’s New England Patriots with a come-from-behind 34-31 victory on Sunday, Fitzpatrick beat out Brady once again yesterday, winning the biggest award of his NFL career when he was named the AFC’s Offensive Player of the Month for September.
While leading his Bills—one of just three undefeated teams in the NFL—atop the AFC East, Fitzpatrick threw for 841 yards, nine TDs (good for second in the NFL) and just three interceptions.  He also became the first quarterback in NFL history to orchestrate back-to-back comebacks from 18-point deficits in league history.
"I think [the award] is a tremendous honor," Fitzpatrick said in a statement. "It really shows how well our offense has played. Whenever you receive an award like that it's not just because of one guy, it reflects the whole team."
Fitzpatrick, whose win over the Patriots was Buffalo’s first since 2003, continues to go places no Bill has gone in a long time.  The Harvard grad is now the first Buffalo player since Drew Bledsoe in September 2002 to win AFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.
“The way he manages the game and the accuracy he's throwing with right now ... he's done an amazing job,” Bills coach Chan Gailey told the team’s official website. “The highest compliment you can pay a quarterback is that he wins. It doesn't matter whether we're up or down or what, he keeps playing well. He's a winner, obviously.”
Fitzpatrick will attempt to keep winning tomorrow when his Bills travel to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals, a game that most would have predicted would have little relevance on the NFL landscape coming into the season.  Now, the football world will be watching to see if the Harvard kid can lead his team to its first 4-0 start since 2008.
For as LeBron James might say, we are all Fitznesses.

After a 3-2 loss last night to Princeton, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (8-5, 1-2 Ivy) turned its weekend around with a 3-2 win over Penn (5-8, 1-2 Ivy). It was the second Ivy League match in as many days for the Crimson, who with the victory earned its first win in its conference schedule. Harvard downed the Quakers 25-21, 20-25, 25-21, 20-25 and 15-13 in its third consecutive five-set match against an Ancient Eight opponent.
After trading wins in the first four sets, with the Crimson taking the opening game, Harvard was finally able to come out on top in a tightly-contested fifth frame.
“We started out sloppily…but before the fifth [set], we knew we had the potential to beat them easily,” co-captain Christine Wu said. “We play with heart and soul … but we just had to take care of every single point.”
Despite taking the first set, the Crimson lost its momentum in the second, mustering only nine kills compared to its opponent’s 20. The discrepancy showed in the final score, as Harvard fell 20-25.
The Crimson bounced back in the third game, recording 13 kills, only to fall again in the fourth set to Penn, which refused to go down without a fight.
The teams were neck-in-neck in the decisive fifth set, but a match-high .417 hitting percentage gave Harvard the edge it needed to seal the victory.
Sophomores Kristen Casey and Natalie Doyle led the offensive effort, with Casey posting a team-high 19 saves and Doyle recording 44 assists. Wu bolstered the defensive with 26 digs, bringing her total to 46 on the weekend.

With much talk focusing on Harvard posting impressive returns on their endowment, bringing the value of investments to $32 billion, it's natural to wonder how the other Ivys stack up. While each institution increased their holding with consistent returns, Harvard's total endowments still dwarfs its Ivy neighbors.Yale posted slightly higher returns on their investment, besting Harvard's 21.4% return with a 21.9% return of their own. While some Yalies might consider this a victory, Harvard's endowment still dominates the $19.4 billion that the Bulldogs now have. After sharp loses in 2009 due to what the New York Times referred to as "considerable investments" in real estate and commodities, Yale's diversification of investments has begun to pay off.
Not enjoying the same level of success as it's more well-known counterparts is Penn, whose returns of 18.6% still bested Cornell, but only brought their endowment to around $6.58 billion according to the Daily Pennsylvanian. Gaining over $1 billion within the fiscal year, Penn enjoyed similar success to the other Ivys.
Last for percent on returns, Cornell enjoyed a 17% raise in its endowment, bringing its total holdings to over $5.27 billion, according to the Cornell Chronicle. Also experiencing the same sizeable losses in 2009 that plagued the other Ivys, Cornell has slowly been growing its endowment in an effort to reach its previous $5.8 billion holdings.
Rounding out the pack for total endowment is Dartmouth, whose $3.4 billion holdings pales in comparison to the other Ivys on the list. Posting impressive gains of 18.4% over the fiscal year, according to the Dartmouth Office of Public Affairs, the endowment gained a seemingly small $415 million.

Most would say that the genetic make-up of the average Harvard male is ideal. The product of an oh-so-coveted vial of Harvard sperm would be a ballroom-dancing, computer-programming, SAT machine. This Ivy League offspring would be intelligent, ambitious, and though slightly lacking in looks, would have exceptional character. Now, due to the marvels of a scientific advancement called artificial insemination, every woman has a shot at creating this Crimson wonder.
Every woman in her right mind would want a Harvard baby, right?
Jeffrey Goldberg, national correspondent for The Atlantic, believes otherwise. When asked by an anonymous reader from New York which of her four guy friends she should choose to be her baby-daddy, Goldberg suggests mixing all four offspring-making juices and seeing which one wins the fertilization race.
He hypothesizes that despite other, more desirable traits, Harvard sperm would never outswim its competitors. Likening sperm prowess to each school’s success at football, Goldberg makes the logical leap and says that we would get crushed.
Goldberg's statements were humorous, but were they true? If athletic ability really said anything about sperm's fighting power, it's not difficult to see why Harvard males might fall short. But don't despair, boys. For any of this to matter, you first need a vessel to house your swimmers. You need a woman.
Luckily, in the art of seduction, you take the cake. Whether by concocting a chemical potion with the perfect set of pheromones, enchanting a woman with a passionate conversation about workers' rights, or by simply dropping the H-bomb, your sperm have a clear path to implantation. Success is inevitable. After all, you do go to Harvard.
