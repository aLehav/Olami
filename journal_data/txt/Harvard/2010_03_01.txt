The recently-passed Senate “jobs bill” might as well have been nicknamed the Senate “let’s-keep-our-jobs” bill. With 70 Senators voting for the $15 billion legislation, including 13 Republicans, the verdict represented welcome progress for the stalled, embattled body. However, it would be a mistake to view the passage of this bill as a bipartisan victory. Along such lines, the media has covered Mass. Senator Scott Brown’s reach across the aisle to support the bill as though his actions were notable. However, voting in favor of such a relatively insignificant piece of legislation does not make Brown a maverick; rather, it highlights the unacceptably polarized state of the Senate today.
Brown’s vote on this bill has been widely analyzed as a heroic political move. The Christian Science Monitor wrote, “In his first big votes this week for a $15 billion jobs bill, Sen. Scott Brown stunned some conservative supporters by siding with Democrats.”
The Boston Herald crowed, “Her campaign tried to label Sen. Scott Brown a ‘lockstep’ Republican, but Attorney General Martha Coakley is now praising Brown’s decision to break with the GOP to support a Democratic-sponsored jobs bill.”
The Hill, a Washington tabloid, announced the passage of the bill with the headline, “Brown helps Reid Win on Jobs Bill.”
However, it is far from encouraging that Brown’s action has been termed such a radical show of “bipartisanship.” In fact, this perception speaks to the outrageous level of factional division in the Senate. Thirteen Republicans voting for a minor bill is barely worthy of discussion, historically speaking. In years past, legislation regularly passed by such margins and garnered little media attention when it did. Yet, today, every measure seems split on party lines. Hostility and blind partisanship are the going order, and, as such, Brown’s adherence to basic representational duties has been mistakenly considered noble.
With the understanding that senators are held hostage by larger political dynamics, Brown’s true test of bipartisanship will come when he casts his vote in favor or against a number of larger pieces of legislation—including those focused on health-care, immigration, climate change, “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” and financial regulation, to name a few. We encourage Brown to choose carefully in these upcoming votes and to carve out an identity as a bipartisan senator in the future. As a Republican representative from historically Democratic Massachusetts, he has unique potential to bridge the ideological divide, and we hope he uses the opportunity wisely.
With regard to the Senate as a whole, we congratulate the body for working incrementally toward change. As the stalling of health-care reform has shown, major overhaul may be difficult or impossible to achieve under the current state of affairs. Given this reality, passing many small-scale bills may be the best way forward. However, if they hope to create a noticeable impact, senators must move quickly to pass a number of additional, minor bills. While any progress is better than none at all, it remains disappointing that the factional atmosphere polluting Washington today makes larger change unlikely.

It is hard to believe that it has been just over a year since President Obama was sworn into office. The feeling of the nation then was hopeful. American voters had just torn down the nation’s final color barrier, and the youthful, eloquent, and charismatic president-elect offered a welcome promise of change. “All this we can do. All this, we will do” the President declared on that bitter-cold January day, in reference to a lengthy list of dire issues facing the nation. Obama vowed to tackle the nation’s toughest problems with strong leadership and resolve. But months away from that hopeful place and time, many Americans have started to lose faith in not just Obama but the basic functionality of the U.S. government. I still have faith and so should the American people.
Today, the mood is anxious and impatient. Pundits on Fox News—often with a little too much glee—consistently attempt to portray the year-old presidency as an irredeemable failure. Sean Hannity has a special gift for making just about anything seem morally outrageous. Commentators from more liberal outlets as well have become somewhat pessimistic, upset by the slow pace of change.
Obama’s first year has certainly not, despite the claims of many, been void of important successes. Economists overwhelmingly agree that stimulus measures helped to stem the hemorrhage of jobs, and now even Republican governors are speaking to its effectiveness in bolstering state economies and preventing mass layoffs. The president has been stunningly effective in reversing the decline of foreign opinion of the U.S. President Obama has drawn the American automobile industry back from the brink, protected equal pay for women, launched innovative education reforms, expanded health-care to four million children, begun the decommissioning of Guantanamo Bay and ending of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” and put the first Hispanic on the Supreme Court. Iraq is stable, and the troops will be on their way home, and additionally, Afghanistan has become the rightful focus of the U.S. military. I could go on.
Though the president’s sweeping attempt at health-care reform has struck upon rocky terrain, there is still a good chance of breaking through the gridlock and passing a bill that will help millions of Americans—he has come farther on the issue than any president in history. Obama’s recent health-care summit was promising enough to make even the oft-cynical Jon Stewart genuinely impressed. And, in the face of some of the strictest congressional partisanship in recent memory, 13 Republicans joined with the Democratic Caucus last week to pass the Senate’s jobs bill.
But if we look for failure, that is undoubtedly what we will find. Failure makes for a powerful media narrative, and this is especially true in the culture of instant gratification created by the 24-hour news cycle. We analyze every minute of Obama’s presidency, expecting constant action and consistent progress. American government has never worked at high speeds, and frankly, it was not necessarily meant to do so. Obama has had a busy first year moving the nation forward whether or not Americans take the time to notice. Perhaps the most poignant critique of the president, in fact, is that he has tried to do too much.
So, while it may have become fashionable to bemoan Obama’s perceived inaction or complain that things are not changing fast enough, the American people should have faith. President Obama understands the magnitude of the challenges facing the country, and he has been acting on them since day one. There still much work to be done, but there is also great progress to be built upon. I am as hopeful today as I was just over a year ago, freezing-cold on the Washington Mall.

Operation Green Hunt is what the Indian government calls it: a codename for a massive operation to counter the menace of left-wing activity in certain parts of India. It is a name that combines hints of green—which evokes the verdant forests that will be the theater of action—with the malevolence of a hunt. This left-wing “extremism” is interchangeably called Naxalism and Maoism. Naxalism, for an insurrection that erupted in a village called Naxalbari in northeastern India in 1967. Maoism, for the guiding philosophies of the principal actor in the fray today, the Maoist faction of the Communist Party of India.
Who are these people, these Naxalites, these Maoists? Who do they fight for? And why? And why this offensive by the government, which by many accounts will deploy more than 50,000 specially-trained troops who employ menacing monikers like COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) and Scorpions? Where does the story begin and who are the key players?
At heart, this is a story of dispossession and exploitation. It is primarily a story of the exploitation of the tribal population of India, called the “adivasis” (which means “indigenous”), many of whom have traditionally lived in the forested belts of India.
It has not just been the lure of the forests and the forests’ products that have been the bane of the adivasis. It is also the fact that most of the tribal areas of India are mineral-rich. It is the “rich land of the poor,” as environmentalist and director of the influential Center for Science and Environment in New Delhi, Sunita Narain, put it recently in an opinion piece by that name.
These developments bring to the fore the rapaciousness of the process associated with the modern idea of development, which often considers some people expendable for a fabricated idea of “the greater common good.” Noted activist Arundhati Roy’s essay of the same name charted—through her example of dam building—how much havoc the process of development has caused. It is a well-known fact that approximately 40 percent of the land acquired for development projects in India belonged to adivasis. Recently, a committee composed of none other than officials of the Indian government acknowledged this fact.
The need to develop rapidly after India gained independence without paying adequate heed to the costs of such rapid development can be seen in the following idealistic and breathless rhetoric in the introduction to India’s Second Five Year Plan, 1956-1961—the Five Year Plans are the chief ways to guide development in segments of five years in India.
It is interesting to note that the same body that formulates the country’s Five Year Plans, the Planning Commission was set up an expert committee in 2006 on “Development Issues to deal with the causes of Discontent, Unrest and Extremism.” Its detailed report from 2008 highlighted the endemic inequalities in Indian society and the acute deprivation in the areas affected by Maoism.
As a response to this growing threat, the Indian government launched a counter-offensive christened Operation Green Hunt in 2009. However, a “hunt” in one form or another has been on for a while now. Since 2005, there has been an armed militia called Salwa Judum (“Purification Hunt” in the local language) in the state of Chattisgarh, comprised mostly of tribal people and blessed by the government that purported to take on the Naxalite menace. This has created a state of near civil war in that state, often pitting people within tribes against each other. There have already been several allegations from civil society groups regarding the targeting of innocent tribal people as part of the Operation Green Hunt—signatories to an appeal to the Indian government included Prof. Noam Chomsky of MIT.
The prominent author VS Naipaul wrote in his book of travels to India in 1990 that, “The liberation of spirit that has come to India could not come as release alone. In India, with its layer below layer of distress and cruelty, it had to come as disturbance...India was now a country of a million little mutinies.” There are big questions to answer for a country that, while proudly trumpeting seven-to-eight percent growth rates each year, also ranked 134th in the Human Development Index in 2009 report. A breathless—and often mindless—form of development at the cost of the voiceless and marginalized is equivalent to practicing a form of internal colonialism. The state must stop conducting a war against its own people. Let crimson not taint green in Indian forestlands.

Quick to the tragic scene in Haiti this past January, Anderson Cooper, CNN’s go-to anchor for covering calamities, found himself overwhelmed. “We all know what’s going to happen in a week or two. People are just going to lose interest in this as a story. They’re going to stop watching.” Cooper, who uttered this aside to his companion for the earthquake’s coverage, CNN medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, spoke with a fatalism borne of long experience reporting on global disasters. Yet as Haiti’s reconstruction efforts continue, the world has a chance to prove Cooper wrong.
A month ago, donations for Haiti’s earthquake victims passed the half-billion-dollar mark, and many Americans continued that support through the Hope for Haiti telethon and coverage during major sports events featuring players of Haitian background, such as professional basketball games and the Super Bowl. According to a Pew Research Center poll on Feb. 3, two weeks after Cooper’s remark, Americans still followed ongoing efforts in Haiti more than any other news story, with no other issue receiving even half as many viewers. Now, the numbers tell a different story. Events in Haiti are now the fifth-most-followed topic—and even then the coverage is not about reconstruction, but instead about the controversy involving American missionaries.
With the Olympics, health-care reform, and even Sarah Palin’s Tea Parties drawing the public’s attention, such a drop-off in coverage and the public’s consideration is unsurprising. The Pew Research Center’s latest findings do, however, indicate that Americans continue to donate to Haitian relief efforts, and over half of American households have now contributed. This number must continue to grow: Those who reached into their pockets immediately after the disaster—myself included—cannot simply give once and move on.
The media must return to Haiti regularly to encourage the public to return to its pocketbooks. Gupta replied to Cooper in January, “In part, it’s up to you and up to us to make sure they don’t forget.” Maintaining media coverage is an obvious starting point for substantiating Gupta’s words. But a broader shift in the way we view reconstruction may be necessary.
Rebuilding from any destruction is difficult—especially in the case of Haiti, a country already in a dire position before the earthquake struck—and naturally such efforts will take longer than outsiders would hope or even expect. The tsunami of 2004 and Hurricane Katrina both have required massive efforts to pick up the pieces and look forward, processes that are still ongoing. The pressure will be on Cooper and other news anchors, however, to chase the next big story. If Cooper really believes what he says, the onus will be on him to return to Haiti every several months and resume its story for the American public. While his reporting may not produce breaking headlines, it will assuredly provide new stories of hope and perspective for those of us removed from Haiti’s struggles.
For now, the people of the United States (and the global community, for that matter) face a great challenge: to maintain support after Cooper and the media has largely moved on. Telethons and publicity provide critical impetus for donations and attention, but we cannot rely on such efforts to direct us. Within Harvard, we have responded well—so far. The Harvard for Haiti initiative to pool donations raised several thousand dollars, with other fundraisers chipping in as well. Our commitment to humanity, however, will be tested more clearly as the fund continues to seek donations in the coming months, when the initial desperate images of the earthquake come less freshly to mind.
Haiti will receive sustained support from its large diaspora in the United States, Canada, and other nations. Their focus seems unlikely to lessen with time, and Haiti has reached out to expatriates’ previously unwelcome expertise. This aid will provide a base in the months ahead, but the resources of the Haitian global community cannot manage alone. The Harvard community, and our home countries, wherever they may be, must remember Haiti’s reconstruction will not simply go away as an issue.
Our greatest challenge will be to keep an eye on Haiti’s people and their struggle to rebuild, even when the news networks and celebrity phone messages move on to the next crisis. Because if Cooper’s fatalism rings true, it is in this sense—Haiti will not be the last humanitarian crisis; there will be more disasters. New causes will demand the attention public attention.
Yet this realization should not lessen our concern for Haiti’s people. When the next major crisis develops, we will again be moved, dismayed, and galvanized into action. If, while moving to help, though, we sustain the ongoing efforts in Haiti, we will prove Anderson Cooper wrong—a story he will surely be glad to cover.

Harvard awarded $100,000 to nine non-profits and local organizations in the Allston-Brighton community on Friday in a ceremony at the Harvard Allston Skating Rink.
The money represents the second round of awards from the Harvard Allston Partnership Fund—a $500,000 fund endowed by Harvard, working in conjunction with the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the Allston community, as part of the University’s $25 million investment aimed at addressing local needs and improving the quality of life in the neighborhood.
The grants ranged from $4,500 to $25,000 and were selected by a committee composed of Allston residents, in addition to representatives of the Boston Mayor’s office and the BRA.
Committee member and Allston resident John A. Bruno said that the grants are a sign of Harvard’s efforts to be a good neighbor to Allston.
“It’s not come easy and it wasn’t always like that,” Bruno said. “We’ll continue to hold Harvard accountable for being a good neighbor.”
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, who presented the grants along with University President Drew G. Faust, called the awards an indication of “Harvard stepping up to the plate” during trying economic times.
Faust said that she was “delighted” to be presenting the awards alongside Menino.
“On so many levels we are working together to make a difference in this community,” she said.
The recipients of the grants varied widely in scope and purpose, but the organizations were all selected for their “impact on our community and all of our children,” according to Bruno.
Some of the organizations will use the funds to supplement their current programs. The Fishing Academy, an organization that arranges group fishing outings for children, will use its $5,000 grant to make its services available to the neighborhood’s underprivileged youth, according to founder John D. Hoffman.
“With these funds they will be able to not just learn how to fish, but skills like teamwork, discipline, respect, and self-confidence,” Hoffman said.
Other organizations will use the grant money to undertake new endeavors. The Brighton Allston Historical Society and Heritage Museum are planning to use the $15,000 grant to “instill pride in the neighborhood” by constructing two outdoor historical installations in North Allston to create a “museum without walls,” according to board member Linda L. Mishkin.
Similarly, the Family Nurturing Center of Boston will use its $17,000 grant to fund a 15-week bilingual parenting program, which will “help parents get in touch with their parenting philosophy,” according to the center’s executive director Matt LiPuma.
The Allston Brighton Youth Hockey, Big Sister Association of Greater Boston, Family Nurturing Center, Friends of the Honan-Allston Library, Gardner Pilot Academy, West End House Boys Camp, and West End House Girls Camp also received grants.

Constitutional law professor Laurence H. Tribe ’62 will take a leave from Harvard Law School to lead a new initiative that seeks to improve access to legal services for the poor and the middle class.
The Access to Justice program will focus on improving indigent defense services—legal assistance for people who are unable to afford a lawyer. Tribe will serve as a primary liaison to the federal and state judiciary, working with judges and attorneys across the country to improve the delivery of legal services, according to Department of Justice spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler.
Tribe, who starts in his new position today, will direct a team focusing on finding alternatives to expensive court- and lawyer-intensive services. Tribe declined to comment for this article.
Theodore B. Olson—a prominent conservative laywer who served as Solicitor General under former President George W. Bush and a longtime colleague of Tribe—said he thinks that Tribe will be consulted by the Department of Justice on many different issues.
“If I had access to [Tribe] when I was in the Department of Justice, I am sure I would have talked to him about many constitutional issues,” Olson said. “I think it’s great for the Department to get a talent like him. He has so much energy and so many ideas.”
According to Schmaler, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. has wanted to make indigent justice issues a priority for a long time. Holder declared that the system is in “crisis” at an indigent defense symposium in Washington, D.C. last month.
Tribe was selected to lead the initiative in part because he has experience in access-to-justice cases in pro bono work, Schmaler said.
Tribe’s pro bono work has often addressed access to justice issues, and he has frequently advocated for policy changes strengthening victims’ rights.
Most recently, Tribe argued Wilkie v. Robbins before the Supreme Court in 2006, representing a ranch owner in Wyoming whose business was compromised when federal land officers pushed him to surrender part of his land.
“I think that throughout his entire career he has shown great interest in these issues,” Olsen said. “I know he feels very passionately about it.”
The duration for the Access to Justice initiative is flexible and will depend in part on the year-to-year budget, according to Schmaler. It is unknown how long Tribe will work for the Department of Justice, she said.
Despite the uncertainty of the project’s timeline, Tribe will be able to ensure the project remains a top priority, Olsen said.
“[Access to Justice] will be organized and disciplined. Initiatives that will be put in place will last,” Olsen said. “People cannot ignore him. No one wouldn’t pick up the phone to take a call from Larry Tribe.”

President Barack Obama has appointed two Harvard alumni as members of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform to devise ways to balance the federal budget.
Alice M. Rivlin, who received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1958, and Ann M. Fudge, who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1977, are among the six nonpartisan members on the 18-member committee that will propose long-term fiscal solutions to Congress by Dec. 1.
Rivlin brings significant budgetary experience and knowledge of federal policymaking to the commission. In addition to acting as the first director of the Congressional Budget Office under President Jimmy Carter, Rivlin served as vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and director of the Office of Management and Budget during the Clinton administration.
Rivlin is currently a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a member of the Board of Directors of the New York Stock Exchange.
In an e-mailed statement, Economics Professor N. Gregory Mankiw praised Rivlin—whom he said he knew well—as an “excellent choice” for the position.
“As a long-time director of the Congressional Budget Office, she fully appreciates the enormity of the fiscal challenges ahead,” Mankiw said.
Rivlin declined to comment for this article and wrote in an e-mailed statement that it was “too soon” to speak to the press.
Fudge, in contrast, has come to prominence through the corporate world. Named by a 2003 issue of Fortune Magazine as one of the 50 most powerful women in American business, Fudge served as chairman and CEO of marketing giant Young & Rubicam Brands from 2003 to 2006 and has held presidencies at both General Mills and General Foods.
She is also a member of Harvard’s Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
Fudge could not be reached for comment this weekend.
Led by former Republican Senate Whip Alan Simpson and former Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, the committee will aim to balance the national primary budget, excluding interest payments, by 2015.
“I know they’ll take up their work with the sense of integrity and strength of commitment that the American people deserve and America’s future demands,” said Obama in a White House press release.
David Cote, chairman, CEO, and president of technology company Honeywell, and Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, were also nominated by Obama on Friday to serve on the commission.

In each of his 18 years teaching at East Oakland public schools, at least one of Jeffrey M. R. Duncan-Andrade’s students had died, he revealed during a conference held at the Graduate School of Education on Friday.
Less than two hours earlier, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86 had finished speaking about his Race to the Top initiative­­, which seeks to address disparities in access to quality education across the nation.
But in Duncan-Andrade’s view, consistently low test scores in poor communities are merely one symptom of a deeper problem.
Drawing on rapper Tupac Shakur’s trademark analogy of “the rose that grows from concrete,” keynote speaker Duncan-Andrade told a full house of GSE affiliates during the annual Alumni Of Color Conference about his path from East Oakland to Berkeley—and why he returned to “reinsert” himself “in the concrete” of his old neighborhood.
Duncan-Andrade, an assistant professor of education administration at San Francisco State University, said he has driven students home so that they would not have to cross gang lines. He has also offered his lunch and bus fares to students, he said.
In a criticism pointed directly at Secretary Duncan’s earlier speech, Duncan-Andrade said that until basic human needs are met in underprivileged neighborhoods, the achievement gap will never be closed.
“We have to be committed to understanding the level of suffering our students have experienced before they enter our classrooms,” Duncan-Andrade said.
He called for teachers to be “healers” in the classroom. Instead of “punching kids out” when they misbehave, educators should instead focus on providing a nurturing environment for students who live in the midst of gunfire, Duncan said.
Ashley Moore, the president of the GSE student government, said that listening to Duncan and Duncan-Andrade’s speeches in the same day reiterated the importance of identifying educational challenges on the ground and addressing those obstacles through national policy reforms.
“I think their hearts are in the same place, but realizing the struggle we are in and need to be in is the only way to change education,” Moore said.

U.S. Secretary of Education Arne S. Duncan ’86 did not mince words as he discussed the shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act.
“Under No Child Left Behind, nothing changed,” Duncan said. “Everyone was labeled a failure and there were schools labeled failures that were actually improving.”
Speaking at the Harvard Graduate School of Education on Friday, Duncan fleshed out the Race to the Top program—a $4.35 billion initiative to close gaps in national educational achievement by taking a data-driven approach to education policy and reform.
“I absolutely see education as the civil rights issue of our generation,” he said to a packed audience that included University President Drew G. Faust, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, newly elected Cambridge Mayor David P. Maher, and 300 others watching via telecast. “Children without those options are basically condemned to poverty.”
Duncan, who grew up in the diverse Chicago neighborhood of Hyde Park where his mother ran an after-school tutoring program for under-privileged children, said he had witnessed gross inequities between his education at the University of Chicago Lab School and the education of his neighbors in other schools.
This experience, Duncan said, spurred his interest in education reform—which has emphasized “rejecting the status quo” and which, he acknowledged, has sometimes led to criticism.
“Let’s have an honest national conversation,” said Duncan, who has been lauded for his previous work as CEO of the Chicago Public Schools. “Let’s all move outside our comfort zones—management, unions, everybody—and say, ‘We need to better serve children.’”
Duncan pointed to a national dropout rate of 27 percent as an indication that sweeping reforms are needed in K-12 education. He also emphasized early childhood education, college prepatory coursework, and the use of transparent data collection to track student progress.
“We want to level the playing field for children entering kindergarten,” he said. “We need to have college-ready, career-ready standards.”
Faust said she personally got to know Duncan during his time on the Harvard Board of Overseers, the University’s second-highest governing body.
“We are really proud that one of our own is in the leadership at this time,” Faust said while introducing Duncan. “We are seeing a move towards the very important incorporation of experimental and data-driven approaches that recognize and reward success.”
But GSE student Todd H. Elkin said that Duncan provided a vague answer to his question about the prioritization of the arts in Race to the Top.
“He placed arts in the context of a lot of different things,” Elkin said after the speech. “It was really hard to tell from his answer what specifically was their plan for the arts.”
GSE student Kendra L. Krause said she was not concerned that Duncan’s agenda could short-change non-academic disciplines.
“His talk at the end about wanting to develop the whole child was evident throughout the speech,” Krause said. “He was addressing every type of child, at every grade level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When shuttle operator Melvin Washington, Jr. left his vehicle on that early January morning to tend to an unconscious man lying on the Peabody Terrace sidewalk, he never expected to be recognized as a hero.
With the help of the sole passenger on the shuttle at the time, Washington carried the unconscious individual into the warmth of the vehicle and promptly called the paramedics.
Last Monday, a month after the incident, Harvard University Police Department invited Washington to a special ceremony to recognize his heroic gestures of kindness. Washington was informed that the man he had rescued—a graduate student at the University—was alive.
To commemorate Washington’s “lifesaving efforts and other valuable contributions to HUPD,” Chief of Police Francis D. Riley awarded him a certificate of appreciation.
Washington also received the Mallinckrodt Medal for “significant contributions” to the department of chemistry and chemical biology, the academic affiliation of the graduate student.
The celebratory event was attended by many “important people,” but Washington said that the most memorable part of the incident’s aftermath has been his bosses’ reactions to the story.
“I really enjoy and care about my bosses, and they care about me,” Washington said, reflecting on the support he received following the incident. “They were so understanding. They made me feel better about myself.”
The Peabody incident does not mark Washington’s first “heroic” act as a Harvard shuttle operator. In the spring of last year, Washington called the police to Winthrop St., where he had stopped an argument before it erupted into physical violence.
Washington said his bosses sometimes jokingly ask him where he hides his cape. When he answers, Washington simply states that ensuring the safety of Harvard students is a part of his job.
“I feel like a bus driver, kind of like a dad, [and even] a counselor,” Washington said with a chuckle.
HUPD spokesman Steven G. Catalano said that he could not comment on the status of the case because the incident was a medical call.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
George Papadopoulos—a former United Research Incorporated project manager for Harvard construction projects in Allston—was arraigned Tuesday morning by the Suffolk Superior Court for embezzling millions of dollars from Harvard and the Massachusetts Port Authority to spend on hotel rooms, home improvements, and Armani suits.
Papadopoulos, who is pleading not guilty, has been accused of sending both Harvard and Massport inflated bills for the amount he had stolen to cover up his theft, in addition to submitting more than 250 falsified expense reports between 2004 and 2008.
Papadopoulos was terminated at URS when his crimes were identified last spring after an internal investigation, according to a statement released by the corporation.
URS informed Harvard of the theft and reimbursed the University for the stolen funds last spring, after Harvard obtained an independent review of its transactions with the corporation, according to a statement from the Harvard Press Office.
Prosecutors allege that Papadopoulos attempted to steal $3 million while he was vice president of URS, and $15,000 from STV, the New York engineering firm that hired him after his termination at URS.
Papadopoulos faces a total of four counts of larceny: three counts for his thefts from URS, Harvard, and Massport, and one count for his theft from STV.
According to court documents, Papadopoulos spent more than $1 million in personal credit card expenses, in addition to $515,000 on home improvements and $110,000 on Armani clothing.
The Suffolk Superior Court has ordered Papadopoulos to remain in his house from 11 p.m. until 7 a.m. and to submit to an electronic bracelet. Papadopolous has also surrendered his passport and cannot leave the state without notifying the Attorney General’s Office.
URS is the construction management firm that is currently overseeing the building of the $1 billion Allston Science Complex. The University is planning to halt construction of the complex this spring, when the foundation of the structure has been completed, but well before it is ready for occupants.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a reversal of a decision passed last Sunday, the Undergraduate Council voted yesterday to suspend efforts to fund the creation of an online study guide library for undergraduates.
Voicing ethical and legal concerns about the project, as well as allegations that UC leaders had not properly ascertained adminstrative approval,  Ellen V. Lehman ’11—a representative from Adams House—made a motion to strike all of the operative clauses from the legislation passed last week.
After a heated debate, 28 representatives voted to overturn the initative, while 12 were in favor of its preservation. Two members abstained.
“We should encourage learning and thoughtful reading,” Lehman said. “And these study guides seem to go against that entirely.”
Representatives feared that the UC would spend the $600 allocated last week to fund the Web site, only to have the project shut down by College deans.
UC Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 said that Dean of Student Life Suzy M. Nelson and Assistant Dean of Student Life Susan B. Marine “were both entirely supportive” of exploring the creation of a study guide library.
But a representative who had attended last Thursday’s Committee on Undergradute Education meeting said that Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and other committee members had expressed reservations about proceeding with the project before its legal and ethical implications were further considered.
“It would look fiscally irresponsible if we spent $600 on a Web site that we are not able to create because the deans say no,” said Treasurer Brad M. Paraszczak ’11.
“We don’t exist to do what the deans want us to do,” Hysen responded, referencing successful UC proposals such as Ad Board reform and Lamont Library’s 24-hour weekday schedule, which he said were initially met with adminstrative resistance. “Our purpose as an organization is to push deans to do things that they don’t want to do.”
While the Council could vote in the future to reinstate this project, Hysen said that last night’s cancellation of project funding would likely prevent the site from launching this year.
Prior to the motion to strike the study guide library plans, the Council passed legislation that formalized the partnership between the UC and Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisers.
The UC also unanimously passed a position paper of recommendations for future January term offerings, primarily advocating on-campus student group programming and University assistance to students seeking January internships through alumni connections.

Although the red Chinese lanterns decorating Harvard Square had been destroyed by last week’s high winds and torrential rains, Mass Ave. was alive with firecrackers, drums, and lion dancers during the Hong Kong restaurant’s Chinese New Year’s celebration yesterday.
After watching lion dancers on the street, the attendees—mainly composed of families with young children—headed into the Kong for an open house event featuring arts-and-crafts on the second floor and entertainment, including a puppet show and dancing, on the third.
The event marked the Kong’s fourth annual New Year’s celebration, the first of which began as a collaboration between the Lee family—who own the Kong—and the Harvard Square Business Association.
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of HSBA, called the Kong “iconic,” and said that the New Year’s celebration sought to recognize the Lee family and to “honor and memorialize the great diversity that is Harvard Square.”
Although the celebration took place two weeks after the actual holiday, it drew several hundred families, Jillson estimated.
The delay was due to the event’s most popular attraction—the lion troupe, according to Paul Lee, son of the restaurant’s founders and the current manager.
“Imagine if you had Christmas, and everyone wanted to celebrate on Christmas, and everyone had to schedule a lion troupe,” Lee said.
He added that many families choose to make the actual holiday a more intimate, family celebration, though New Year’s revelry can extend well into March.
For Kari D. White, who brought her three young girls to the event, the open house was truly a family event. White, who worked at the Kong as a waitress, bartender, and manager from 1995 to 2000, is testament to what most Harvard students say can’t be done: she found true love at the Kong.
White met her husband, Sean, at the Kong while they were both employees at the restaurant.
Whether it’s a place to find love or to have a fun Friday night, Kong founder Buoy Lee is proud of the success the the Kong has had in Harvard Square.
In the spirit of Chinese New Year’s, Lee said, “We are lucky. We are very lucky.”

After years dedicated to shedding light on the work of the late Harvard Egyptology Professor George A. Reisner, Class of 1889, Peter D. Manuelian ’81 will become the first egyptology professor at Harvard since his predecessor’s death 68 years ago.
Manuelian, currently an egyptology lecturer at Tufts, will be the first person to fill the Philip J. King Professorship, which was established in the fall of 2006 to support the study of ancient civilizations.
The professorship’s search committee specifically sought an egyptology scholar to fill the position, according to Classics Professor Christopher P. Jones, who headed the search.
Ancient Egypt is an important academic area due to its ties to Biblical, Mediterranean, and particularly African histories, Jones said.
“It is very important that Africa should be a part of what everyone thinks about the modern world,” Jones said. “And Egypt is a major African civilization—probably the best known.”
Though Harvard offers the occasional course related to ancient Egyptian history, it has not had an egyptology professor since 1942, when Reisner died during an excavation in Giza, Egypt.
Reisner, one of the foremost authorities on ancient Egypt, left much work unpublished when he died.
As the director of the Giza Archives Project at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston—a Web-based initiative that aims to “assemble and link” the world’s archaeological information on the Egyptian Pyramids—Manuelian has worked to publish Reisner’s findings from the period between 1910 and 1940.
Manuelian, who hopes to engage students in the project, wrote in an e-mailed statement that he is “very excited” about the potential synergy between Harvard and the MFA—“with Giza work progressing on both sides of the Charles River (and eventually along the Nile!).”
“Harvard has a spectacular legacy of archaeological fieldwork in Egypt from the first half of the twentieth century,” Manuelian said. “I am very excited that the University has chosen to revive its commitment to the study of ancient Egypt.”
Archaeology concentrator Jordan E. Osborn ’12, currently taking a course on hieroglyphics, said she eagerly awaits the opportunity to take more classes about ancient Egypt.
“Egyptology is the epitome of archaeology,” Osborn said. “It is central to the development of [archaeology] as a science.”

Harvard Kennedy School has received a $5 million gift to create a new graduate fellowship fund, HKS officials announced Friday.
Donated by Glenn Dubin, co-founder and CEO of New York-based Highbridge Capital Management, the funds will help launch the Dubin Graduate Fellowships for Emerging Leaders at the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership. The fellowship will go into effect in the coming academic year.
Celebrating its tenth anniversary this year, the Center boasts a number of fellowship programs designed to provide financial incentives that would attract the best students from around the world, said HKS Professor of Public Service David R. Gergen, the Center’s director. The gift, he added, will facilitate the goals of the center.
“Our mission at the center is to help develop a new generation of leaders...[and] we’re very proud that Glenn Dubin has joined the ranks of our benefactors,” Gergen said.
An active member in the Robin Hood Foundation and the Mount Sinai Medical Center, both based in New York City, Dubin forged his first connection with the Kennedy School two years ago when he spoke before HKS students.
“After visiting us, [Dubin] decided he wanted to make this a major focus of his philanthropy,” Gergen said.
The bulk of the funds will go to scholarships for students over the next five years, and up to ten fellowships will be awarded per year, Gergen said.
The Dubin Graduate Fellowship for Emerging Leaders will include a welcome retreat, a leadership discussion series, field experience, and connections with CPL and Dubin Fellows alumni, according to the Kennedy School Web site.
“What makes [fellowships] work most effectively is that the students have experiences together in which they can develop ideas and relationships,” Gergen said. “The glue that develops between them is also what propels them forward.”

An 8.8-magnitude earthquake—one of the highest ever recorded—struck central Chile on Saturday, killing over 700 people, destroying homes, and leaving members of the Harvard community deeply anxious about the status of students studying abroad and loved ones residing in the country.
In immediate response to the disaster, the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies’ regional office in Santiago, Chile ensured that Harvard Study Abroad students were all safe and sound, according to Todd Washburn, Harvard’s assistant provost for international affairs.
Saturday’s earthquake did not only create concern for Harvard students studying abroad, but also for loved ones and friends living in Chile.
Many students who previously spent time in Chile have contacted their host families and been relieved to find that they are unharmed, said Lisa Schechner ’11, who lived with a host family in Santiago last summer through one of the DRCLAS programs.
Students who had studied and worked abroad in Chile have been corresponding with each other about the disaster, according to Schechner.
She said that Harvard students were relieved to hear from Samuel H. Crihfield ’11, who spent last summer in Chile and is currently there to study. Though Crihfield is safe, he said he is trapped in the southern town of Pucón due to damaged roads and bridges.
People, roads, bridges, and houses have undergone destruction as a result of the earthquake—which occurred at a depth of 21.7 miles, whereas the recent earthquake in Haiti occurred at a depth of 8.1 miles.
Despite the ensuing distress, however, Schechner said that she believes the infrastructure in Chile was better prepared than Haiti for such a catastrophe.
“Personally, I hope that this will allow the country to bounce back from such a disaster,” Schechner said.
It remains unclear whether the earthquake will have a significant effect on Harvard’s future programs in Chile, according to Veronica R. Martini, the development and external relations officer for DRCLAS.
For now, the Harvard community sends its “deepest concern for this terrible tragedy,” Martini said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Before she knew it, the fall semester was over, and Jane W. Baldwin ’11, an earth and planetary sciences concentrator, found herself struggling to finish over reading period a final project worth 50 percent of her Applied Math 115 grade.
In past years, students spent roughly 40 hours on the mathematical modeling assignment over winter break, but this year’s calendar change meant that they faced a bigger time crunch before the end of the semester.
“I spent a lot of time thinking, ‘Was this something I screwed up? Could I have scheduled this better?’” Baldwin says about the project, which was assigned two weeks before Thanksgiving break. “Realistically, there was not enough time to allocate to something like that before reading period.”
Despite memories of a stressful reading period—not unfamiliar to many students this past semester—Baldwin says she ultimately prefers the new schedule. She got her finals out of the way and even got to spend more time with her boyfriend at Carnegie Mellon over January term.
“It was definitely worth the small increment of more stress,” Baldwin says.
Thanks to this year’s long-awaited calendar change, three days were shaved off of reading period, fall exams were moved before the winter break, and the College’s first ever J-Term was created.
But the changes caught many faculty and students by surprise, as they failed to adjust their class schedules and duly spread out their work to alleviate a build-up of stress toward the end of the semester.
College administrators attribute the unanticipated stress of the compressed semester to a lack of planning by both students and faculty, though proposals for rearranging vacation days in the fall semester are still up for discussion.
“We’ve heard there’d been some glitches,” said Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds. “People didn’t quite take in what the change was and what they needed to do to adjust.”
IN A FRENZY
Dunster House tutor and English teaching fellow Sabrina Sadique recalls an overwhelming demand for office hours toward the end of last semester as students scrambled to finish final papers.
“[Professors] were trying to cram everything in the last minute,” Sadique says. “The [syllabi for many courses] just seemed to be the same syllabi they would teach anyway.”
Unable to help all the students “from all kinds of fields” who approached her, Sadique says she regularly extended her office hours until 2 a.m.
Echoing Sadique’s observations, Adams House Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 characterized the end of the semester as ”very badly managed” by faculty in general.
“I think that many of the faculty have to take this somewhat shortened term and take it somewhat more seriously and readjust their curriculum,” Palfrey says.
Some professors—such as Henri Zerner, who teaches History of Art and Architecture 10—say that the new semester schedule does not allow enough time to cover course material from previous semesters.
“I don’t like the new calendar,” Zerner says. “I think everything is extremely rushed, and students don’t really have enough time to absorb whatever the course was about.”
Zerner adds that students also had less time to work on end-of-term projects, such as final papers.
But David J. Malan ’99, who teaches the popular course Computer Science 50, says he adjusted his lesson plans and assignment due dates to reflect the calendar changes. Students were asked to submit final project proposals—which range from coding Google Android or iPhone applications, to designing Web sites—before Thanksgiving, or two weeks earlier than in past years.
“I think it worked out much better,” Malan says. “Everything was still very fresh in their minds.”
TIME MANAGEMENT
Like Baldwin, most students who left the bulk of their work until the end of the semester say they faced more work and tighter deadlines than in past years.
Yoseph S. Ayele ’11 admits that he could have reduced some of the stress with better planning.
“I think it takes some getting used to from our side,” Ayele says of the compressed time constraints. “Before we used to take a break [in the beginning of 10-day reading period] before studying for finals.”
R.J. Jenkins, the head teaching fellow for the popular “Lit and Sex” course English 154, says the loss of holiday break before exams was “really felt” by upperclassmen accustomed to the old schedule.
Freshmen, on the other hand, had a “very easy time” with the new calendar, Jenkins says, as it is “the only calendar they’ve known.”
Despite student complaints about the shortened semester, Dean of Undergraduate Education and Cabot House Master Jay M. Harris reports that the College saw the highest average grades in its history, with an increase in grade point average of one-hundredth of a point.
“Student performance overall did not suffer in any way,” he says. “That doesn’t mean a specific student was not thoroughly overwhelmed.”
Harris adds that he felt many of the concerns students raised may have been unfairly attributed to the calendar changes and that part of the problem lies in work habits, such as procrastination.
“Students should either not save as much [work] for reading period as they used to or not have as long a ‘Camp Harvard’ as they used to,” Harris says.
A ‘BIGGER REWARD’
Though the fall semester changes brought heightened stress at the end of the semester for many students, even those who vocalized the new schedule’s problems celebrated the stress-free J-Term.
Under the old schedule, many final projects and papers were due after the long winter break, and students only had a week of intersession between semesters. And impending exams and deadlines loomed during winter break.
“The way I saw it, we were getting a lot of work out of the way sooner, [with] a bigger reward at the end,” Romeo P. Alexander ’11 says. “If anything, last year was worse because professors assigned a ton of homework during Christmas break.”
Sadique, who says she talked with many stressed students during exam period, adds that students were able to recover and catch up on sleep during J-Term.
“All that labor that they complained about—they had forgotten about most of it by the time they came back from the longer vacation,” Sadique says.
VACATION DAYS?
While administrators concede the new schedule caused added stress this past semester, it is unclear whether there will be structural tweaks for the next academic year.
The College’s survey of undergraduate’s J-Term experiences—which had a student response rate of over 30 percent—yielded over 270 pages of comments from students, according to Harris, and administrators say they are waiting to pore through the feedback before deciding whether concrete action is necessary.
“We’ve heard complaints from students and faculty both that the end of the semester was too rushed and compressed—whether that’s really indicative of the broad feeling across the community or whether that’s really just a couple of vocal folks, we don’t know,” Harris says. “That’s why we did the survey.”
While the University sets the start and end dates of the academic calendar, College administrators say they are unsure whether they have the power to rearrange vacation days, such as creating a fall break or extending Thanksgiving break.
Harris says it is “premature” to discuss any changes to the academic schedule before survey results have been reviewed, though that and other options are “being looked at.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an office on the second floor of 7 Linden St., Boston Red Sox figurines hang along the white walls, which are plastered with alcohol awareness posters. The office’s occupant, Ryan M. Travia, is Harvard’s go-to man for alcohol and drugs education on campus.
For the past five years, Travia has served as the director of the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services. His role involves organizing Harvard’s alcohol education programs, working with treatment providers at University Health Services, and developing policy-based initiatives for the University related to alcohol and drug use.
Travia promptly begins his day at 6 a.m. After eating breakfast, he takes the train to his office—located above the Bureau of Study Counsel—where he first tackles the slew of e-mails in his inbox. Then, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Travia is busy with administrative meetings and student conferences.
AODS advertises its hours as 9 to 5, but most of its student programming occurs at night. Travia said that he participates in most of the after-hours events, and he noted the fast-paced and varied nature of his schedule.
“Every day is different,” Travia said. “That’s what I love about my job.”
Since taking the AODS directorship in 2005, Travia has been involved in creating many of the alcohol and drug education programs at Harvard. Travia has “essentially single-handedly created” AODS and many of the
programs that fall under its umbrella, such as DAPA and Alcohol Communication & Education Skills training for athletes, according to J.P. Chilazi ’10, former president of Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors.
“None of these programs existed before Ryan was brought to Harvard,” Chilazi wrote in an e-mailed statement.
Leading DAPA, which Travia describes as “the heart and soul of the [AODS],” comprises a significant part of his job. The DAPA program, which began in Jan. 2006, is an organization made up of Harvard undergraduates trained to respond to alcohol and drug-related questions on campus.
The students involved in DAPA, Travia said, are close to his heart.
“I get my inspiration from the DAPAs,” he said. “They try to be good role models.”
The admiration is reciprocated. Cullen D. McAlpine ’11, the current president of DAPA, described Travia as a “gifted mentor and leader” with the unique ability of focusing the energy of a group and inspiring students with his own passion for peer education.
“Ryan cares intensely not only about the DAPAs but also about every member of this community,” Chilazi said. “[T]hat is why he has decided to dedicate his life to improving the health and well-being of students on Harvard’s campus.”
Travia, who received a Master’s degree in education from Boston College, had originally planned to be a teacher. But after working in peer mediation throughout middle and high school, and his undergraduate years at Boston College, Travia fell into his current career.
After finishing graduate school, Travia moved to Dartmouth College to serve as the coordinator of Alcohol and Other Drug Education (Programs). In 2005, Travia took his current job at Harvard.
“It’s been a fun ride,” Travia said.

Though data suggests that more Harvard undergraduates are admitted to Stillman Infirmary for alcohol intoxication or poisoning, it remains unclear whether the increase in volume means that students are drinking in greater quantities than before.
The number of undergraduate students seeking treatment for alcohol-related illnesses at University Health Services is likely to rise for the second straight academic year, according to data provided by the Office of Alcohol and Other Drug Services. The figure will likely reach roughly 200 by the end of the spring term.
If AODS’ predictions are correct, the figure represents a 43 percent increase in the past two years, marking an upward trend after a period of stabilization from 2005 to 2008.
According to Harvard officials involved in alcohol and drug education on campus, there remains no definitive reason for the up-tick in Stillman admissions, but they hypothesize that the answer lies in a combination of the College’s amnesty policy and nation-wide increase in alcohol consumption as a result of stress from the economic climate.
COLD BEERS, HARD FACTS
Among Harvard undergraduates who consider themselves drinkers, about 73 percent consume between zero and four drinks on a typical night. The remaining 27 percent of students engage in high-risk or binge drinking, according to AODS’ data, and the figure is well below the national average of college students who engage in binge or high-risk drinking.
While the number of alcohol-related hospitalizations is on the rise, the number of undergraduates who require ambulance assistance because they have reached an inordinate degree of intoxication has remained constant, hovering at around 40 cases a semester, according to AODS Director Ryan M. Travia. These students often have the highest blood alcohol levels, he added.
Despite such promising figures, more Harvard freshmen engage in “pregaming” than those at other schools nation-wide. At Harvard, 42 percent of freshmen drinkers pregame, and 39 percent of freshmen drinkers take shots—both percentages are higher than national figures.
Indeed, Travia noted that most Stillman admissions are related to the consumption of hard alcohol, often consumed during pregames.
“We have an inordinately high percentage of students that report drinking hard alcohol,” Travia said. “Virtually every single student we see at Stillman, it’s hard alcohol. Most of the time it’s shots—and if you want to be really specific, vodka.”
Still, this year’s freshman class contains a greater number of heavy drinkers, in addition to more abstainers—a description that fits the national trend, according to Travia.
“Nation-wide, we’re seeing increases at both ends of the spectrum,” he said. “We’re inheriting more students coming to Harvard that are identifying as abstainers or non-drinkers, and more students showing up who are already drinking in very problematic ways. Theoretically, some of those students at the higher end might be showing up in UHS.”
Travia said there is no clear indication that this year’s freshman class has inflated the number of students in need of care. Nevertheless, freshman have consistently comprised about half of those hospitalized for alcohol-related illnesses, continuing the pattern.
The increase in the number of students admitted to UHS for alcohol-related illness does not represent a change in the percentage breakdown by class year.
“The fact that it’s occurring through all four years means that something’s happening throughout the college,” said Director of Behavioral Health and Academic Counseling Paul J. Barreira.
AMNESTY, EDUCATION, SUCCESS?
Both Travia and Barreira emphasized the absence of data directly indicating that Harvard undergraduates were drinking in greater quantities.
“We really shouldn’t jump to the conclusion,” Travia said. “We do conduct a lot of research and we’ve got a lot of data, and we have nothing that suggests that people are drinking more dangerously.”
The efficacy of the College’s alcohol amnesty policy and education programs may account for at least part of the increase in students seeking help at Stillman, according to Travia and Barreira.
Harvard’s three-year-old amnesty policy states that any student who seeks help from UHS for alcohol-related illness will not face disciplinary action for providing or consuming alcohol, and any student who brings a friend to Stillman to be treated will also not face disciplinary consequences.
The advertisement of the amnesty policy may have made dangerously intoxicated students more willing to be brought to UHS and similarly made onlookers more comfortable with the task, according to Barreira.
Both Travia and Barreira said that programs like the Drug and Alcohol Peer Advisors program may have increased awareness of the symptoms of alcohol poisoning and of the steps that one can take when a friend is critically intoxicated.
DOWN LIKE THE ECONOMY?
In the case that the rise in Stillman admissions can be attributed to students drinking larger quantities of alcohol, one potential explanation may be the stresses created by the nation’s dismal fiscal climate.
“Even though there is a deep recession and a significant amount of unemployment, people are drinking more,” Barreira said. “The alcohol business is booming, especially the cheaper liquors.”
“I don’t know why the college campuses would be immune to that effect,” he added.
Many Harvard undergraduates would feel the stressors of the economy, said Barreira, citing concerns such as parents’ ability to afford their children’s tuition and seniors’ employment prospects upon graduation.
Still, Barreira and Travia said that they have not yet found the key to understanding what has caused the increase in alcohol-related illness admissions to Stillman.
“We’re going to continue to gather our research and data, and continue to do what we do, encouraging students to make healthy choices,” Travia said.

The Harvard Foundation named multi-platinum artist Wyclef Jean the 2010 Artist of the Year during its 25th annual Cultural Rhythms show on Saturday.
The event included an afternoon and evening show in Sanders Theatre and a Food Festival featuring international cuisines prepared by cultural groups on campus.
The selection of the Artist of the Year is based upon an individual’s humanitarian work, according to Harvard Foundation Director S. Allen Counter. Jean, a Haitian-American who founded the Yéle Haiti Foundation, made significant contributions to the relief efforts in the aftermath of the disastrous earthquake that crippled Haiti in January.
“We couldn’t have anticipated the Haiti earthquake. However, it demonstrated Jean’s humanitarian bent,” Counter said. “As we came closer to narrowing the choice down, naturally his humanitarian efforts in Haiti were a factor in his selection.”
Before an audience that included Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith and Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds, Jean celebrated the cultures of performance groups, in addition to his own, and urged the audience to continue to support Haiti.
“As the news cameras go down, let’s keep fundraising, sending doctors and helping rebuild the infrastructure of Haiti,” Jean said.
When Jean took the stage for the afternoon show, he showed off his crimson Harvard sweatshirt and then performed a rap that incorporated multiple languages as well as his own Haitian background.
“Wyclef Jean’s opening rap with its use of different languages exemplified what Cultural Rhythms is—the bringing together and celebration of different backgrounds,” said Kevin X. Liu ’11, the co-director of the afternoon show.
Fifteen cultural groups—including the Asian American Dance Troupe, the Kuumba Singers, and the Harvard Breakers—performed in the afternoon show.
U.S. Treasurer Rosa C. Rios ’87, who introduced the performance by Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán, was also a special guest.
The evening show, which was hosted by Jonathan Figueroa ’10 and Erinn V. Westbrook ’10, included a dance competition for the 150 children in the audience who participate in Phillips Brooks House Association programs, according to evening show co-director Miguel Garcia ’12.
Jean also made a surprise appearance at the evening show, opening it with an original arrangement on the acoustic guitar that included his song “Sweetest Girl.”
To honor the event’s 25th anniversary, a special alumni reception was held Saturday morning and a video montage of memorable moments was played at the start of the afternoon show.
“I was moved by how cohesive we are as a Harvard family,” Counter said. “It was wonderful to see students of all backgrounds come together as a family for these performances.”
In the past, Artists of the Year have included actors Matt Damon ’92–’93, Will Smith, and Denzel Washington and actresses Halle Berry and Salma Hayek.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It might have been the shot heard ’round the ECAC when junior Kate Buesser rifled the puck past the entire Princeton defense and goalie Rachel Weber from just past the blue line. But shortly into the second period, it was clear that the No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team (20-6-5) had more than one gun in its arsenal as it fired its way to a 4-1 victory over the Tigers—and a sweep of the ECAC quarterfinals—Saturday afternoon at Bright Hockey Center.
Princeton (13-14-4) came out hard early in a game of possession scrambles and physical hockey. But while the Tigers’ hits mainly came on opposing players, the Crimson directed its aggression towards the puck, outshooting its opponent, 14-2, in the first period.
“It was a physical weekend, no question,” Harvard coach Katey Stone said. “But, you know, I like how our kids weathered the storm when there was a little bit of pressure put on them. They turned it right back on Princeton.”
But the Tigers’ physicality prevented the Crimson from getting clean shots off close to the net and stumped Harvard for the first eight minutes of the game. Unable to move the puck past a wall of black and orange, freshman Josephine Pucci fired the puck to the top of the zone where Buesser waited unguarded.
The junior fired the puck through a crowd of Tigers to put the Crimson up by one.
That shot opened up the floodgates. The forward’s goal gave Princeton no choice but to cover Harvard’s forwards across the ice, which opened up the ice around the cage for future Crimson infiltrations.
But before Harvard ran up the score, it had to kill two first-period penalties. The Crimson used its speed to pressure the Tigers and hold them scoreless on the power play.
“It’s easy to kill a penalty when your two forwards are in there forechecking and they can’t even get it out of the zone,” co-captain Kathryn Farni said. “So they make our job easier. If the puck does get in our end, we have a lot of energy to go forecheck.”
“We did a nice job getting in lanes,” Stone added. “More importantly, when there was a puck in front of the net, we cleared it well.”
When the Crimson had all five skaters on the ice, Princeton seemed bewildered, as Harvard kept finding creative ways to put the puck in the net.
“That makes coaches feel really good, because then you’re hard to scout, you’re hard to play against,” Stone said.
Fifteen minutes of ice time after Buesser scored with raw power, freshman Kaitlin Spurling added her own flair to the game, backhanding the puck into the goal shortly after senior Anna McDonald’s rush had offset the Tiger defense.
“We really got into the thick of it down at their end and in the trenches and scored some good and ugly goals as a result of it,” Stone said.
Despite Stone’s characterization, nearly all of the Crimson’s goals came cleanly. Less than three minutes after Spurling’s score, junior Liza Ryabkina solved Weber for her third goal of the weekend. Once again, Pucci was there to get the puck to her upperclassman teammate, sending the puck across the zone, where Ryabkina had an open look.
“It was big for us to come out strong in the second,” senior Randi Griffin said. “At that point in the game, it could have gone either way. If they had gotten a lucky break or gotten a goal or something, they would be so pumped, because for them the season was really on the line.”
By this time in the game, Harvard’s superior conditioning was evident. With the Crimson controlling possession, the Tigers went looking for the puck and seemed to find the penalty box instead, committing three second-period penalties.
“We’re in really good shape,” Griffin said, “which has to do with how hard coach pushes us in practice, and how hard they push us in the gym.”
With its season on the line, Princeton picked up its game in the third period. After being outshot, 11-3, in the second, the Tigers were only outshot by three in the third, and one of those shots managed to find the back of the net. Melanie Wallace lifted the puck into the high corner of the net on an unassisted play at 6:19, reducing the deficit to 3-1.
Unable to solve Harvard goaltender Laura Bellamy again, Princeton pulled Weber with about two minutes left in regulation. But the Crimson had already killed six penalties by that point and wasn’t intimidated by the man-down situation.
With an empty net waiting at the other end of the ice, all Harvard needed was a possession.
Ryabkina found the puck and charged down the side of the ice, but a Tiger skater slammed her into the boards. As she was hit, Ryabkina managed to send the puck to the middle of the ice, where a wide open Jillian Dempsey picked it up.
With a minute and a half remaining in regulation, the freshman sent the puck into the open net, Harvard into the ECAC semifinals, and the Tigers back to New Jersey.
“We did just what we wanted to do today,” Griffin said.

Another big game, another crushing loss for the Harvard men’s hockey team.
Facing St. Lawrence (15-13-7, 9-8-5 ECAC) in a match in which it could have locked up home ice in the first round of the ECAC playoffs with a win, the Crimson (7-19-3, 7-12-3) came out flat and didn’t recover until it was too late, falling, 4-3, in Canton, N.Y.
“We’re a little disappointed,” senior forward Doug Rogers said. “It’s much easier to win at home in the playoffs.”
Harvard took the first three shots of the game, but the Saints got on the board first after freshman forward David Valek was issued a five-minute penalty for hitting from behind. St. Lawrence’s Aaron Bogosian took advantage of the five-on-four situation when he jumped on a loose puck in front of the net and put it past Harvard junior goalie Kyle Richter to give the Saints the lead at 6:48.
“That kind of swung the momentum in their favor,” Rogers said of the penalty.
Richter and the Crimson defense were able to kill the remainder of the penalty and remained solid through the rest of the first period to keep the score 1-0, despite being outshot, 19-9.
“I think overall we had a good first period, but I think the five-minute penalty made it tough to leave the period with a lead,” Rogers explained. “It can be tiring for all the penalty killers and the goaltenders.”
In the second period, things began to fall apart for Harvard. Saints forward Alex Curran hit Mike McKenzie with a pass from behind the net, and McKenzie backhanded the puck past Richter at 3:46. Just two minutes later, forward Brandon Bolig connected on a one-timer off a two-on-one rush to make the score 3-0 in favor of St. Lawrence.
At this point, Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 opted to pull Richter in favor of junior Ryan Carroll, who late in the second gave up a power-play goal to Saints defenseman George Hughes. The freshman used a screen and was able to shoot the puck past Carroll from the blueline.
Down 4-0, with its back against the wall and nothing to lose, the Crimson turned to a new strategy in attempt to get back into the game.
“I think we just [became] committed,” Rogers said. “We were desperate at that point. We started playing more offensively, taking more chances, we shot a lot more...It was a mindset. We made up our mind to throw everything to the net so guys could anticipate that and get in front of the net for rebounds.”
“We knew we had to win the game in order to get home-ice advantage,” added freshman forward Louis Leblanc. “So we emptied the tanks.”
The plan payed immediate dividends, as Leblanc was able to finally get Harvard on the board at 19:51 of the second period.
“[Sophomore] Alex Killorn chipped the puck to [junior] Michael Biega, and Michael made a great pass across the slot, past the defenseman’s stick,” Leblanc explained. “It found my stick, and I shot it low block past the goalie.”
It was the freshman’s 11th goal on the season, which leads the team.
“It’s fun to see that [I led the team], but I pride myself on the little things and the team before myself,” Leblanc said.
Heading into the third, Donato put Richter back in net, and the Crimson offense kept up the aggressive pace.
Two minutes into the period, freshman defenseman Danny Biega took passes from sophomore Ryan Grimshaw and freshman Conor Morrison and fired a slapshot past St. Lawrence goalie Alex Petizian from the right side of the ice.
The game remained scoreless for the next 12 minutes, when Harvard senior defenseman Chad Morin was able to pick up a deflected shot from the left side of the net and put it past Petizian. Morrison earned his second assist on the game on the shot, and sophomore forward Daniel Moriarty got a point as well.
But the Crimson’s desperate attempts to tie up the game were unsuccessful the rest of the way, and St. Lawrence hung on to earn the win.
“We ran out of gas,” Leblanc said.
Richter finished with 32 saves on 35 shots, while Carroll saved nine out of 10.
It was the Saints’ first win in February after they went 0-4-3 in the month’s first seven games. The win locked up the fifth seed for the ECAC playoffs, and they will host Clarkson in a best-of-three first round.
Harvard, meanwhile, fell to the ninth seed and will have to travel to New Jersey next weekend to take on Princeton. For Harvard, it’s now all about consistency.
“In every game we’ve played, we’ve had a period where we’ve been the better team,” Rogers said. “We’ve had times where we’ve been great defensively and not so threatening offensively and vice versa. It’s just a matter of finding the right balance.”
“We’ve got to put the season behind us,” Leblanc added. “Hopefully we start peaking now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Skiers across the league must have wondered where Dartmouth acquired its new team member, because surely the “HAR” on the results sheet must have been a typo, a simple one-letter mistake. It seemed impossible that a Harvard skier could have really placed sixth in the EISA Championships, hosted by Middlebury. But, in fact, Cara Sprague had, finishing less than a minute slower than overall winner Katie Bono of the Big Green.
“I thought I’d had a good race, but I was apprehensive about getting excited too early,” Sprague said. “The way I found out was I was coming back from my cooldown when two freshman girls on our team ran up to me and started tackling me. It was way better than finding out by reading a sheet of paper.”
The junior led the Crimson nordic women to a second place finish in the event, behind only Dartmouth—which completed its second-straight undefeated Carnival season this past weekend—for possibly the highest finish in Harvard’s history.
“I think [there has] probably not [been a finish that high],” said nordic coach Chris City ’94. “Certainly not in my memory. It’s possible that in the late 60s or early 70s the alpine team might’ve had a result that good...I’m not sure how to express our excitement. That’s really unprecedented.”
It was Sprague’s first time as the Crimson’s top finisher this season.
“She’s had good parts of races before,” City said. “She just was able to put it all together for 5k. She was moving really fast the whole way.”
Finishing second for Harvard was freshman Esther Kennedy, who placed 14th, with classmate Alena Tofte finishing 10 seconds behind to place 19th. Captain Audrey Mangan rounded out the Crimson’s top four with a 27th-place finish.
“They’ve been putting that in week in and week out,” City said. “I’m incredibly proud of the work that the women did all fall. They took lessons from what went well and what didn’t go so well. I think there was a lot of confidence-building—getting used to being up with the front pack.”
Also marking out a place for herself in Harvard history was freshman Catherine Sheils, who took eighth place in the slalom, fueled by her first-place finish in the event’s second run.
“That’s got to be the best result of a Harvard alpine skier in 25 [or] 30 years,” alpine coach Tim Mitchell said.
Sheils did not have the same success yesterday in the giant slalom but still managed to place 11th in the second run—despite starting after all the top skiers had gone and conditions had deteriorated.
“For Catherine to finish 11th on the run was just incredible,” said men’s alpine captain Chris Kinner. “She skied very smart tactically.”
The historic finishes could not save the Crimson from another ninth-place finish.
Entering into the final two events of the carnival, it looked like Harvard, only 10 points behind Bates, might have been able to break through for its first eighth-place finish of the season.
But eighth- and 10th-place finishes by the women’s and men’s nordic teams in the free events prevented the Crimson from moving up in the overall rankings.
And while captains Chris Kinner, Trevor Petach, and Audrey Mangan weren’t able to find that elusive eighth place, all three finished their careers with the team’s top finishes in their respective events.
Kinner was the Harvard men’s top finisher in both the slalom and giant slalom while navigating his way through ever-changing conditions.
“Yesterday was ridiculous,” Kinner said. “It would be sunny one second and blizzarding the second. I went out of the start knowing that I had this ahead of me...I was really psyched.”
Petach led the way in the 20k free skate, after freshman Anthony Ryerson had the team’s top finish in the classic race—his best finish of the year. The nordic team had the potential to be a family affair, but the younger Sprague, freshman Kevin, broke his pole midway through the free race before rallying to finish just behind Petach.
“It was a really good race overall for the guys,” City said. “They had two frustrating races in the middle of the season. It was really good for them to finish with strong races.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite having a statistically solid game, the Harvard men’s hockey team fell in overtime to Clarkson Friday night at Cheel Arena, 2-1.
Although the Crimson (7-19-3, 7-12-3 ECAC) had many opportunities early in overtime, the Golden Knights (8-22-4, 4-15-4) edged Harvard on Andrew Himelson’s first goal of the season three minutes into extra time.
“We thought that we outplayed them,” said Crimson sophomore forward Alex Killorn. “We just didn’t get the bounce we needed.”
Harvard dominated the first two periods with its solid defense and powerful forecheck.
The Crimson allowed only four shots in the first period and nine shots in the second, most of which either fell wide or ended up in the glove of junior goalie Ryan Carroll.
“The defense played great,” said senior Doug Rogers, who won a season-high 19 faceoffs. “They were really aggressive, [and] they move the puck well to the forwards. We didn’t really give up much. The forwards did a great job checking and helping the defense out. For 60 minutes, we had a great five-man effort on defense.”
But Harvard could not capitalize on the basis of solid defense and numerous power play opportunities. Despite controlling the ice, the Crimson took only 11 shots in the first two periods combined.
“We move the puck a lot,” Rogers said. “We wanted to put a little more pressure on their goalie, but we didn’t.”
It seemed like most of the game turned into a duel between Carroll and Clarkson goalie Paul Karpowich, who made 21 saves while withstanding a barrage of power plays.
One of Harvard’s chances in the first period was a falling shot from junior Pier-Olivier Michaud from the left side of the ice. But Karpowich made a great save and then shut the Crimson out during the ensuing power play caused by a Golden Knight hooking foul.
Carroll was solid as well, making 20 saves—including five consecutive stops on a Clarkson power play in the second period. The junior also made an important save on a Matt Beca breakaway to help preserve the tie.
“Ryan Carroll always plays really well in big situations,” Killorn said. “He played phenomenally for us.”
Both teams came onto the ice in the third period with offense on their mind, and Rogers drew first blood with a wrist shot after taking advantage of a turnover in the neutral zone. But Clarkson responded just 11 seconds later on Louke Oakley’s score into an open net following a bad bounce for Harvard behind its goal.
“One of the plays, the puck bounced over [Carroll’s] stick,” Killorn said. “He was out of position, and they had an open net.”
The Crimson started off strong in overtime, taking time on each possession and getting the first three shots of the period.
But Karpowich came up big, making consecutive saves and shutting out Harvard.
In the third minute, Himelson received a pass from Beca and scored the gaming-winning goal from the corner.
“I thought in overtime we were going to win the game,” Rogers said. “Our team played really well...We were confident that we weren’t going to lose. It was very disappointing.”
“I think we realize we have a good team and that we had a tough year,” Rogers continued. “[In the playoffs], if we can bring the offense that we are capable of, I think we will be fine.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Pop the champagne bottles and let the celebration begin.
After finishing 12-0 on the season, the No. 1 Harvard women’s squash team embodied perfection as the squad went on to defeat No. 3 Penn, 6-3, to capture the national title at the College Squash Association’s Team Championships hosted by Yale.
This victory was a fitting ending to a season full of accolades, namely the Ivy League Title and the Barhite Award—a prize for the team with the best record in the nation.
The Crimson was refused the title last year when it lost a heartbreaking matchup to Princeton, 5-4. But this year, Harvard would not be denied. Having last won the title in 2001, the Crimson is finally bringing home the Howe Cup, squash’s illustrious trophy given to the best team in the nation.
“I’m still in a little bit of shock,” co-captain Johanna Snyder said. “But some of the emotions I’m feeling are excitement and relief. Definitely a ton and ton of excitement. We worked so hard for this. Nobody from last year’s team graduated, so everyone who was there got to experience the win this year.”
HARVARD 6, PENN 3
Harvard lived up to expectations, as it reached the final for the second year in a row. Penn, on the other hand, had to overcome higher-ranked Trinity in a close semifinal round that ended in a 5-4 win for the Quakers.
The Crimson knew that Penn was ready to avenge the 8-1 loss that it suffered earlier in the season, but Harvard had different plans.
Junior June Tiong started the day off by defeating the Quakers’ Sydney Scott, 3-0. Snyder followed that up with a 3-1 win at the No. 6 spot, ending her collegiate career with a perfect record this season. Fellow captain Katherine O’Donnell also recorded a win in a close 3-2 match with Christina Matthias.
Sophomore Nirasha Guruge rebounded from a loss the previous day to beat Nabilla Ariffin in four games. At the No. 1 position, freshman Laura Gemmell preserved her unbeaten record (11-0), coolly sweeping all three sets from Kristen Lange.
Freshman Natasha Kingshott also finished the season without a loss, after she pulled through a close matchup with Yarden Odinak, 3-2.
The season, full of highlights and accomplishments, came to a close for the three Harvard seniors, eliciting tears of joy from all the members of the team.
“As captain, I am proud of everyone on the team,” Snyder said. “It’s hard to come out there and play your best in these conditions. Everyone was mentally strong, and we played for each other, and that’s what got us this far.”
HARVARD 7, YALE 2
A fierce Ivy League rivalry was set up in the semifinals as Harvard faced Yale on enemy turf for the second time this season.
The first time around, the Crimson defeated the Bulldogs, 7-2, and, to add salt to the injury, claimed the Ivy League championship in the process. Yale was unable to stop Harvard once again, ceding a spot in the national championship game to the No. 1 team in the nation.
But the Bulldogs seem to have found a way to contain Guruge, as she fell for the second time this season to Alia Aziz. Guruge appeared to have momentum on her side after taking the first game, 11-8, but Aziz knew her opponent too well. The next two games allowed Aziz to gain confidence, winning a nail-biter in the second, 13-11, and soundly defeating Guruge in the third, 11-6. Guruge decided to return the favor with an 11-8 win in the fourth game, setting up a critical fifth game. Aziz held on for the win at the No. 2 spot, taking the last game with a score of 11-8.
“I lost to her the first time we faced Yale to win the Ivy League title,” Guruge said. “This time I extended it to five, but I still lost, so I hope to beat her next time if I play her at the individual tournament next weekend.”
Tiong also suffered a loss at the No. 3 spot, conceding defeat to Yale’s Sarah Toomey, 11-4, 11-7, 11-8.
Even though the Crimson fell twice, the team was never in danger of dropping the matchup. Harvard swept four opponents, including Gemmell’s usual 3-0 win at the No. 1 spot, and also comfortably won at No. 6 by a 3-1 margin. Junior Bethan Williams overcame a loss at the No. 9 spot to take the next three games, rounding out Harvard’s day before the title game.
HARVARD 9, WILLIAMS 0
With the pressures of a first-round win to get things started, the Crimson accomplished its goal and more.
Harvard dismantled any threat that Williams attempted, beating all nine opponents in three sets, with the highest scoring game coming in the No. 5 spot, when Kingshott allowed the Eph’s Caroline Henry to score a mere seven points in the third game.
The matchup seemed to magnify the preparation Harvard undertook all season long and the quality of its players. No. 1 Gemmell once again didn’t seem to fret, swiftly defeating her opponents in three games, as she has done all season.
Guruge had an even easier time sweeping Williams’ Jennifer Coxe, considering that Coxe only managed to put up seven total points through three games. The other seven competitors also showed little sign of nerves in the win.
The CSA Individual Championships will take place next weekend in Hartford, Conn.

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 1, 2010
The Mar. 1 sports article "Women's Squash Captures National Title" incorrectly stated that co-captain Johanna Snyder won her match by a score of 3-2 in the national championship match against University of Pennsylvania. In fact, the score was 3-1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On his team’s senior night, co-captain Jeremy Lin was the star once again.
Lin led all scorers with 26 points, as Harvard (20-6, 9-3 Ivy) cruised to a 78-58 win over Yale (11-18, 5-7) at Lavietes Pavilion Saturday night.
The victory also broke the Crimson’s 65-year-old single-season wins record, which had stood at 19 wins since 1945—the last time the team went to the NCAA tournament.
“It’s crazy when you think about having the most wins out of any team in Harvard history,” Lin said.
It seemed appropriate that the record-breaking victory would come on the night of the seniors’ final home appearance.
After an emotional ceremony celebrating the careers of the four veterans—Lin, co-captain Doug Miller, Pat Magnarelli, and Dan McGeary—Harvard coach Tommy Amaker tweaked his starting lineup to allow the four to start together, along with freshman Brandyn Curry.
“I was very happy and proud of our seniors to allow them to finish their careers with a win,” Amaker said.
Each of the seniors was able to get points on the board, including McGeary, who came off the bench with 2 minutes left in the game and hit a technical free throw for his only point of the contest—and of the season.
Most of the early scoring, though, was done by freshmen—including Curry and Kyle Casey—who finished the game with 14 and 13 points, respectively.
“Brandyn played very well for us early. [He] did a good job of finding people and also scoring the ball,” Amaker said.
During one stretch in the first half, Curry scored 11 straight points for the Crimson—including three straight three-pointers—to stretch the lead to 11.
“I just had open shots, and I was making them,” Curry said.
The rookie’s outburst helped to put away the Bulldogs early, although Amaker credited the entire team for coming out prepared and keeping the pressure on.
“I was very pleased with the effort and the energy,” Amaker said. “We played great defense.”
Indeed, Harvard contained Yale’s Alex Zampier—the league’s third-best scorer—limiting him to only 16 points.
Amaker was also quick to commend the efforts of Lin.
“He got off to a pretty good start early scoring,” Amaker said. “He’s a special player.”
Lin also dominated the highlight reel, throwing down a one-handed dunk in transition to extend the Crimson’s lead in the first half.
And once the game was in hand in the second, he turned the contest into the Jeremy Lin show with a series of circus shots and mid-air acrobatics, garnering “MVP” chants from the students.
“I was just trying to have fun out there,” Lin said.
But the highlight reel didn’t end with Lin. Sophomore wing Max Kenyi stole a pass in transition, looked over his shoulder and slammed the ball home with a one-handed tomahawk jam to seal the Harvard victory with a minute left in the game.
“Max has been talking about that for while,” Curry said.
Although Kenyi’s dunk capped the win for the Crimson, the home squad had pulled away for good much earlier. Harvard built on a 14-point halftime lead, stretching it to as many as 24 points when Lin hit a pair of free throws with five minutes remaining in the game.
The two free throws, Lin’s final points in his home gym, were followed by a standing ovation as he exited to allow McGeary to finish up the game.
“This is one I’ll never forget,” Lin said.

First-game jitters were not much of an issue for the Harvard women’s lacrosse team’s freshman class.
In its first collegiate game, the class of 2013 netted all 10 of the Crimson’s goals, as Harvard (1-0) won its season opener on the road at UMass (2-3), 10-8.
“It was great to go there and get the win,” junior Sam McMahon said. “I’m glad that [the freshmen’s] first game in a Harvard uniform was a win.”
With the Minutewomen’s defensive attention focused on Crimson junior Jess Halpern—last season’s Ivy League leader in goals per game—other members of the team were freed up for scoring opportunities.
The team’s freshmen were the biggest beneficiaries.
“Any team would be stupid to not shut her off,” freshman Jennifer VanderMeulen said. “Jess could barely touch the ball. We knew that Jess was going to be face-guarded. I feel like [us] freshmen took it upon ourselves to help her.”
And help her they did.
Classmate Alexis Dal Col tallied five goals on eight shots, while VanderMeulen added four scores, including the game-winner. Rounding out the scoring for the Crimson was rookie Danielle Tetreault, who finished with one score on two shots.
“Everyone else stepped up to the plate,” McMahon said.
Harvard fell behind in the game’s early minutes, but Dal Col and VanderMeulen each netter their first career goals in under 10 minutes of play to put the Crimson on top, 2-1.
Harvard’s lead would grow throughout the half.
With under a minute to play in the first frame, VanderMeulen took the ball herself and made her way to the goal, where she was able to put the ball past the Minutewomen’s goalkeeper to score her third goal of the game and give the Crimsona 6-4 lead heading into the break.
Dal Col struck first to start the second, and suddenly Harvard found itself up by three with less than 25 minutes to play.
But UMass would not give up easily, responding with three-straight tallies in less than 10 minutes of play to even the score at seven.
“We kind of relaxed a little bit,” VanderMeulen said. “We didn’t win as many draw controls, and UMass was able to take advantage of it.”
But with the game on the line, Harvard’s youngest players played like veterans.
Less than three minutes after the Minutewomen’s Merritt Cosgrove knotted the score, Dal Col was able to find the back of the net. The rookie took the ball unassisted and beat UMass’s Katie Florence to retake the lead.
Once again, the Minutewomen would claw their way back into the game, tying the score again off a shot from Haley Smith.
This time, VanderMeulen would be the one to step up, rushing down the field and scoring off a free position shot just 35 seconds later to give Harvard the 9-8 lead.
The Crimson defense would hold strong over the final 10 minutes of play, keeping UMass from getting on the scoreboard and giving Harvard the 10-8 victory.
Senior Katherine Martino anchored the Crimson in net, finishing with seven saves in her first victory of the season.
Harvard had the benefit of being able to scout the Minutewomen—who have already played four games this season—and was able to prepare for and respond to UMass’s aggressive and physical style of play.
“We kind of knew what to expect from UMass, and we tried to capitalize on their weaknesses,” VanderMeulen said. “We knew that UMass had high-pressure defense, so we tried to take them one-on-one.”
The strategy was largely successful, as only two of the Crimson’s 10 goals were assisted.
In addition to employing high defensive pressure, the Minutewomen also focused on shutting down Halpern, who accounted for 28 percent of her team’s scoring a season ago. Facing heavy defensive attention, Halpern was only able to come away with a single shot.
But with the addition of such an offensively-talented freshman class, Harvard’s opponents will soon have to think twice about where they focus their attention.
“I’m sure teams are going to go after [Halpern] again, until they realize they have more than one person to worry about,” McMahon said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday was a night filled with Harvard-Yale basketball, as the men took on the Bulldogs at Lavietes Pavilion and the women traveled to New Haven to face their rival in the final road game of the season. The Crimson women’s team (18-7, 9-2 Ivy) improved its win streak to seven games with a 68-60 victory over Yale (12-14, 7-5).
The victory was a team effort, as three Crimson players—freshman Victoria Lippert, sophomore Brogan Berry, and junior Emma Markley—scored in double-digits. Harvard shot 44 percent from the field and outrebounded the Bulldogs, 40-31, in the contest.
The game got off to a competitive start—going back-and-forth for the first few minutes—until two consecutive jumpers by junior Jackie Alemany and sophomore Caitlin Rowland from beyond the arc gave the Crimson a 15-8 lead with 14:12 left to play in the first half.
Harvard then went on a 7-0 run, holding Yale scoreless for almost 10 minutes of play, and went into the half leading by 19.
The Crimson shot 55 percent from the field in the first half and 67 percent from three-point range, grabbing 21 rebounds and dishing out 13 assists as a team.
Lippert went 6-for-14 from the field and a perfect 4-for-4 from the free-throw line, notching 16 points and 11 rebounds for her third collegiate double-double. She also recorded three steals, two assists, and a block in a full 32 minutes of play.
“[Lippert] played tremendously,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “To have that stat line as a freshman is incredible.”
“[Lippert] was a beast on the boards tonight,” Berry agreed.
Berry added 13 points and four rebounds of her own in the win. She also had five assists, moving into 10th on the Crimson’s all-time assist list, tying Allison Feaster ’98 with 243.
“[Berry] had an unbelievable night,” Delaney-Smith said. “Every team is trying to take her out of the game, but she rose to the occasion tonight. She ran this team, and I had to play her for 32 minutes. I thought she was a tremendous floor leader.”
“It is part of my role as the point guard to make my teammates better and give them opportunities to score,” Berry said. “They are the ones who finish the plays.”
Markley put up 11 points and grabbed seven rebounds but was only able to play 12 minutes after getting into early foul trouble.
Delaney-Smith noted how proud she was that her young team was able to stay so poised with one of its leaders out for most of the second half.
Leading 59-34 midway through the second half, the Bulldogs went on a surge with two 9-0 runs to bring the Crimson’s lead down to 11.
With less than a minute left to play in regulation, Yale cut the lead to single digits at 66-58.
The Bulldogs’ comeback was unsuccessful, though, as two free throws from Lippert and a layup from freshman Miriam Rutzen clenched the win.
Rutzen finished with two points and a career-high nine rebounds. Alemany also set a career high in the game with six steals.
“I was thrilled with how we started,” Delaney-Smith said. “I was thrilled with how we dominated them, and I was thrilled with how we weathered the storm.”
With three games left to play in the regular season, Harvard looks to finish with victories versus Penn, Princeton, and Dartmouth—who defeated the Crimson in its earlier meeting this season—and receive a bid to a tournament.
“We had that loss to Dartmouth,” Delaney-Smith said, “but there are still three games. We’re going to go to a postseason tournament one way or another.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For co-captain Jack Brady, Harvard track has come a long way in four years.
“When I was a freshman, we scored less than 10 points at [the Heptagonal Championships] and finished dead last,” the senior recalled.
Things have improved a bit in Jason Saretsky’s tenure as head coach.
The men’s and women’s squads traveled to Hanover, N.H. to take part in the 2010 Indoor Heps this weekend, with both teams taking fourth at Leverone Field House to finish among the top Ivy League competitors.
“I’m really pleased—it was great to see both teams finish in the top half,” Saretsky said. “On the men’s side, [fourth] was the highest finish since I’ve been here, and the women did a great job of competing and holding their own.”
The Crimson men had a number of strong showings in the midst of a tight race—Harvard earned 53 points, behind Dartmouth’s 55 and ahead of Columbia’s 52.
“It’s just fantastic...to see not only how we’ve progressed this year, but also to say that we are just as good as the best teams in the Ivy League,” Brady said. “It was a really great weekend, and I’m really happy for our guys.”
Harvard showed its strength in the middle distances, as sophomore John Dingus raced to a second-place finish in the 400-meter dash, crossing the line in 48.81 seconds. Dingus also helped the Crimson to a third-place showing in the 4x400-meter relay, along with co-captain Justin Grinstead and sophomores Jonathan Meminger and Robbie Paris.
“[Dingus] is a great competitor and really does well when he’s out in front,” Saretsky said.
“He put up a very impressive time, especially on that track,” the coach added, referring to the fact that Dartmouth’s non-banked track runs slower than most indoor facilities.
Junior Brian Hill and sophomore Darcy Wilson also had standout efforts, taking fourth place in the 800- and 1000-meter events, respectively, to add four points apiece to the team total.
But on a day where numerous Crimson competitors stood out, it was again Brady who made the biggest splash. The ECAC and IC4A qualifier notched yet another personal best, taking third in the shot put in dramatic fashion. The co-captain stood in sixth place through five throws but unleashed a mammoth toss of 16.84 meters on his final attempt to jump three spots—just .03 meters behind second-place finisher Bryan Powlen of Brown.
Brady added a second-place finish in the weight throw.
“That’s the kind of stuff we train for,” Brady said. “We work so hard for a little moment, a two-second burst. Nothing feels better than a personal best.”
Still, Brady was far from focused on his own performance. The co-captain also noted that freshman Edward Brucker enjoyed a personal best of his own, topping 16 meters for sixth place in the shot put. In addition, with individual championships on the horizon, the senior noted the added intensity of team competition.
“You feel more accountable about your performances,” he said of Heps. “You want to do well not only for yourself but for the team.”
The women’s squad certainly felt this team spirit as it pushed for its own fourth-place finish, rallying despite significant injuries.
Harvard amassed 61 points on the weekend, due in large part to good performances in races and multi events.
“We didn’t enter women in a couple events due to injury...but those who did compete competed well and rose to the challenge,” women’s co-captain Thea Lee said. “We had one person on the podium for every event [we participated in].”
Lee followed just behind rookie Carlyle Davis as the two runners finished third and fourth in the 800-meter race, adding 10 points to the team score. Freshmen Olivia Weeks and Ashtynn Baltimore also provided a boost for the Crimson, taking second in the triple jump and long jump, respectively, with efforts of 12.10 and 5.99 meters.
“I thought every athlete that competed held her own,” Lee said. “At the end of the day, really the whole team did great.”
Saretsky also noted the standout effort of a pair of pentathletes, sophomores Christine Reed and Nicole Sliva. The Harvard women added another 10 points with third- and fourth-place finishes, logging a number of personal bests through the five events.
“The event went great,” Saretsky said. “[Reed and Sliva] are just gamers. They have a great, great competitive attitude and really got after it.”
So too, it seemed, did the entire Crimson team. Although neither squad could keep pace with Ivy powerhouse Princeton, whose men’s and women’s teams swept the championships with 181 and 125 points, respectively, Harvard will look to build on its momentum as various athletes prepare for individual competition at ECACs and IC4As next weekend.
“Both [the men’s and women’s] teams came on really strong this season,” Sarestky said. “They competed best when it mattered the most.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Opening the season as a ranked team for the first time since 2006, the Harvard men’s lacrosse team handled its business like it had been there all along.
Playing on a snowy Cumnock Turf, the Crimson rode the scoring efforts of nine different players to defeat Canisius, 16-6.
No. 12 Harvard (1-0) scored the first three goals of the contest before the Griffs (0-1) scored a man-up goal. Canisius’s Alex Caldiero bounced it past sophomore goalie Christian Coates for the Griffs’ second goal within 52 seconds, leaving them down only 3-2 heading into the second quarter.
Any hopes of an upset were squashed early in the second quarter, though, when the Crimson followed junior Dean Gibbons’s second goal of the match with three consecutive goals within 21 seconds to put Harvard ahead, 7-2.
Canisius never recovered from this meltdown, allowing two more goals in the second quarter en route to a 9-3 halftime deficit. The Crimson outscored the Griffs, 6-1, in both the second and the third quarters, and the game was all but over.
“Harvard beat us in transition today,” said Canisius head coach Randy Mearns. “Our mistakes led to the ball being in the back of the net. Our heart and effort was there today, but our full field execution was spotty.”
Gibbons notched a career-high five goals to lead the Crimson in scoring, while sophomore Jeff Cohen added three goals and an assist. Freshman Jack Doyle recorded a goal, and fellow first-year Alex White scored a goal and dished out two assists, as 14 Harvard players recorded points on the day.
“I think anytime you can get a win early in the season, you’ll take it,” Crimson coach John Tillman said. “There’s some guarded optimism. There are some things that we need to do much better. As much as you may be disappointed in certain things, we’re excited, because if we continue to work and focus on some areas, we can get a lot better.”
Part of the reason why Harvard was able to score so quickly was because it dominated faceoffs. Overall, the Crimson won 80 percent of its faceoffs, including 15 of 16 in the second and third quarters. Junior Christian Oberbeck was 9-of-12 on faceoffs and Junior Andrew Parchman won seven of his eight draws. Freshman Jeff Molinari led Harvard with five ground balls to go along with two assists, as the Crimson held a 31-20 advantage in securing loose balls.
Despite the win, Harvard certainly showed some opening-game rust. The Crimson had six more turnovers than the Griffs and also allowed Canisius to convert on three of its four extra-man opportunities.
“There were a lot of young guys out there today and you have to keep emphasizing certain things,” Tillman said. “You have to stay patient, though, because they’re only going to get older and better.”
In between the pipes, Coates earned his first career victory, with 11 saves and four goals allowed through the first three quarters, but had a costly turnover in the third. After a save, Coates carried the ball himself to nearly midfield. After trying to lob it over the first line of defenders, his pass was intercepted and launched into the goal before Coates could get back. Freshman Harry Krieger played the fourth quarter and saved two shots.
“I think there are some things we have to keep working on [in goal], but, all in all, it wasn’t a bad start,” Tillman said. “Both those guys are pretty close, and it’s been a pretty close battle along. I think they’re going to continue to battle each other all year long, and I think it’s going to make them better and our team better.”
Harvard will travel to Washington, D.C. this Wednesday to take on the No. 13 Georgetown Hoyas. The game will be televised on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network and is Harvard’s only televised game of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday’s win over Yale marked the last home game in the career of four seniors—co-captains Jeremy Lin and Doug Miller, Pat Magnarelli, and Dan McGeary.
After giving roses to and taking pictures with family before the game, the four seniors took the court to start (freshman guard Brandyn Curry rounded out the starting five).
“[I was] very happy, as you can imagine, and proud of our seniors,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I think all four of those kids did some good things for us.”
Lin led the way with 26 points on 9-of-13 shooting, in addition to five rebounds, three assists, and five steals.
In the second half in particular, Lin put on a show with acrobatic lay-ins and smooth jumpers.
After knocking down a three from the top of the key late in the half, Lin backpedaled down court with his tongue hanging out.
“I was just trying to have fun out there. This was my last time playing here with my buddies,” Lin said. “I was just trying to attack, just have some fun, and just be loose.”
Miller, who contributed four points, two rebounds, and a block, also joined in the fun.
Midway through the second half, Lin found the big man sprinting up court, and Miller flushed a two-handed dunk before the Bulldog defense could catch up.
Magnarelli added nine points and a team-high eight rebounds in only his second game since returning from an ankle injury that sidelined him for five weeks.
McGeary played 10 minutes, his most on the season, and scored his first point this year on a technical free throw with 51 seconds remaining in the game.
“I don’t think it could have [gone] any better,” said freshman guard Brandyn Curry of Senior Night. “All of them got in, they all played great, and we got a victory at home.”
“This [game] is one that I’ll never forget,” Lin said. “It’s going to be a lifelong memory.”
HIGHLIGHT REEL
Saturday’s action featured a pair of show-stopping dunks.
The first came with roughly four minutes left in the opening frame.  Curry and Magnarelli teamed up to steal the ball from Yale forward Michael Sands in the post, and Lin raced down the floor.
He received the ball along the left sideline and took it hard to the rim where he finished with a one-handed tomahawk slam.
“I was pretty determined to throw that one down,” Lin said. “I hadn’t gotten one in a while, and I thought here’s my chance. I just wanted to...muster enough energy to get up one last time.”
The other noteworthy dunk came with one minute remaining in the contest. Freshman guard Max Kenyi stole the ball from Bulldogs forward Paul Nelson at midcourt and took off with no one in pursuit.
Kenyi jumped off one leg, cocked the ball behind his head, and threw down a violent dunk to punctuate the victory.
“Max has been talking about that for a while,” Curry said. “He’s always talking about, ‘Imma get one this game.’ He got one. He really took off. He threw it down.”
TEAM RECORD
The victory was the Crimson’s 20th on the season, breaking the old record of 19 wins set in 1945-46.
“That’s just a lot of hard work,” Lin said of the milestone. “We’re just glad that we can break records.”
The 1945-46 team was the last squad to make the NCAA tournament.Harvard has similar ambitions this season. Although Cornell has all but wrapped up the league title, the Crimson has a shot at a number of postseason tournaments.
In the more immediate future, Harvard has a chance to tie its record for league wins—11—next weekend when it takes on Penn and Princeton.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
They walked into Princeton’s DeNunzio Pool ranked seventh in the ECAC Women’s Water Polo Championships. They walked out in sixth.
While not a big leap, for the members of Harvard’s women’s water polo team, a jump in tournament standings after only one win and two losses was still pretty nice.
Falling early Saturday to the No. 2 seed Marist (4-6) by two goals, the Crimson (7-3) came from behind to pick off Wagner (3-7) with a 14-9 victory. The momentum couldn’t continue, though, as Harvard lost to Bucknell (5-2) in yesterday’s matchup.
“We didn’t do as well as we had hoped that we would do, but we did a lot of things well this weekend that hopefully we will be able to carry into next weekend,” sophomore Shannon Purcell said.
BUCKNELL 9, HARVARD 7
Even with 32 shots against Bucknell goalie Allison Carter and goals on each of its three six-on-five chances, Harvard couldn’t hold on to a 3-3 tie at halftime, letting the Bison steal the win in the third quarter.
The Crimson recorded the same number of goals as Bucknell in the first, second, and fourth quarters, but the Bisons slipped two shots by Harvard sophomore goalie Laurel McCarthy in the third, giving Bucknell the lead.
McCarthy’s four saves helped make it a sophomore morning, as three of the Crimson’s sophomores saw their shots hit the back of the net. Monica Zdrojewski took the lead with a hat trick, while classmate Ita Barton-Kettleborough tallied two and Lizzie Abbott grabbed one. Freshman Elise Molnar rounded out the score with a goal of her own.
Even with an aggressive offense, 11 penalties plagued Harvard, leading to five goals on Bucknell power plays to end the weekend.
“We just stopped acting like a team that wanted to score,” Molnar said. “We lost that fire and that drive to finish to the end.”
HARVARD 14, WAGNER 9
Harvard faced a similarly tight game the night before, as the Crimson found itself down 6-3 at halftime. An 11-3 run before the final buzzer solidified Harvard’s only win of the weekend.
“We had played Wagner before, and last time was a pretty close game, but we knew exactly how they played,” said Purcell, who was one of six Crimson players to score. “We went into it with the mindset of we know we should be able to beat them, and we’ll just play our game, and the outcome should be as we want it to be.”
Down 3-1 in the first quarter, the Crimson knew it needed to switch gears. With McCarthy locking down a solid defense in the third quarter, Harvard held the Seahawks to a solitary goal before tallying four of its own. McCarthy had nine saves throughout the match, giving the offense room to breathe in the final quarter.
Tied at seven with eight minutes left, Harvard racked up seven more tallies, led by sophomore goal-leader Devan Kennifer, who scored four goals for the second time that day. Junior Patricia Smith recorded a hat trick, while five other Crimson players found the back of the net.
“It’s always really hard going into a tournament and losing the first game, but I think that we’ve shown that we are a team that can come back from a loss and come back just as hard,” Molnar said.
MARIST 12, HARVARD 10
Earlier Saturday, Harvard again faced a deficit going into halftime against the No. 2 seeded team in the tournament.
Down 7-3 after the second quarter, the Red Foxes seemed poised for an easy win, but another four-score game from Kennifer, as well as two points each from Molnar and Zdrojewski, created doubts.
The Crimson grabbed a burst of energy in the third period, scoring three goals, and found itself down one in the fourth period with five minutes left on the clock. Harvard managed to score two more before time expired, but Marist grabbed three, leaving the final score 12-10 in the Red Foxes’ favor.
“It took us a little time to get our shooting down,” Purcell said, reflecting on all three of the Crimson’s games. “I think that even though [our ability to capitalize on shooting opportunities] is something we lost, it’s something that’s easily correctable. I think just this week with practice working on that, we shouldn’t have any problems in the future.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The struggles of the men’s volleyball team continued over the weekend, as its winless streak extended to eight after a 3-0 loss to Rutgers-Newark at the Malkin Athletic Center on Saturday.
“The guys really want the first victory bad,” Harvard coach Brian Baise said. “We were hoping to get it tonight in our first league match, and it didn’t happen.”
The Scarlet Raiders (3-9, 3-0 EIVA Hay Division) got off to fast start against the Crimson (0-8, 0-1), jumping out to an 8-1 lead—an advantage it did not relinquish en route to winning the first set, 30-22.
The second set provided the match’s drama. After a kill by Rutgers-Newark’s Dan Mulligan to begin the frame, Harvard senior Soren Rosier responded on the next point with a kill of his own. From there, the Crimson gained momentum. Co-captain Gil Weintraub racked up three kills, and the Scarlet Raiders made nine attack and service errors, as the Crimson’s lead swelled to 17-11 midway through the set.
On a day when Harvard hit just .153, Weintraub led the team with 12 kills and a .450 hitting percentage.
“[Weintraub] clearly provided a lot of the offense,” Baise said.
Rutgers-Newark came storming back after Dane Mulligan and Jon Keller teamed up for two blocks and a pair of kills. A service ace by Mulligan capped an 11-2 run that swung the score back in Rutgers-Newark’s favor, 22-19.
Harvard and the Scarlet Raiders battled back and forth for the rest of the set. Up 25-24, Crimson sophomore Nikola Ivica sent a serve long to even the game. Moments later, another service error— this one from Weintraub—tied the score once again at 26.
Harvard had two set points, one at 29-28 and another at 30-29, but each time a Mulligan kill tied the game.
Similarly, Rutgers-Newark missed its first two opportunities to close out the set. On the first chance at 31-30, Mulligan’s serve did not clear the net, and Eduardo Hernandez made the same mistake at 32-31.
The third time was the charm for the Scarlet Raiders. Crimson co-captain Erik Kuld could not handle Mulligan’s spike, and the ball ricocheted off the senior and out of bounds to give Rutgers-Newark the set, 34-32.
“We haven’t gotten that first victory, we haven’t pulled out a lot of those games, and until we break through and do that, we get a little tight in those situations,” said Baise of the second set.
After dropping the middle frame, Harvard was blown out in the third and final set. The Scarlet Raiders got out to a 12-6 lead, forcing the Crimson to call a timeout. But even after play resumed, Rutgers-Newark expanded its lead to as many as 11 points before winning the set, 30-20.
“We tried not to let [the second set discourage us], but it’s always difficult when you’re so close,” Weintraub said.
Mulligan and Hernandez led the Scarlet Raiders in kills with 13 apiece, while Jeff Zornig contributed a team-high 41 assists.
“I thought their setter was good,” Baise said. “Their outside hitters made very few errors. They were solid all around. They have no real weaknesses.”
After Weintraub, Kuld had the second-most kills with nine, and Rob Lothman led the way with 27 assists.
“Our passing was off tonight,” Baise said. “That’s the key to the offense. If the pass isn’t there...it just makes for a long night.”
The loss dropped Harvard to 0-8. The Crimson did not win a set in all of February.
Nevertheless, Harvard remains optimistic.
“We’re still really hopeful we can turn it around,” Weintraub said. “This is only the first league match. We play all those other matches to see what works and what doesn’t work. We still have a lot of league matches ahead of us, and we look forward to them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!
The Harvard fencing teams came up just short of an Ivy League title at the Ivy League Championships, Part II yesterday, bouting against conference opponents Columbia, Brown, and Princeton.
Both the men’s and women’s Crimson squads easily beat the Bears, only to be thwarted by eventual Ivy champions, the Tigers.
Against the Lions, the women suffered their second conference loss in a close 14-13 match while the men swept Columbia, 21-6.
“Coming into the tournament, both teams had a chance to at least tie for the Ivy title,” Crimson coach Peter Brand said. “Although we fell short in the end, I’m overall pleased with the performances.”
Considering that this time last season the men’s team was tied for last place in the Ivy race, second place—although not bearing a title—is a vast improvement.
Both Crimson teams faced Brown initially to open the tournament. The women, led by sophomore co-captains Noam Mills and Caroline Vloka, defeated the Bears convincingly, 24-3. The women posted 8-1 finishes in each the epée, foil, and sabre.
Similarly, the men took down Brown in a decisive 20-7 victory headed by sophomore Valentin Staller, who earned a perfect 9-0 record on the sabre in the tournament.
The Bears were only able to edge Harvard in the foil, 5-4, with the Crimson asserting an 8-1 advantage in both the sabre and epée.
The men continued their domination against the Lions, winning all three weapons, but conceded their winning streak in the 18-9 loss to the Princeton.
The Harvard men garnered a 5-4 victory in the sabre, but the Tigers were able to maintain a 7-2 advantage in the foil and epée.
“We hoped to beat Princeton in the tournament,” captain Karl Harmenberg said. “We did our best but ultimately were unable to.”
On the women’s end, the Crimson fell in close matches to both Columbia and Princeton, 14-13. In its bout against the Lions, Harvard dropped the sabre, 7-2, and the epée, 5-4, but won the foil, 7-2.
Against Princeton, the women gained the sabre and foil, 5-4, but lost the epée, 6-3, consequently losing the match.
“The women’s team fenced extremely well, losing two really close bouts,” Mills said. “Hopefully next year we can come back and win.”
Despite being unable to gain the title, the Crimson had eight individuals receive All-Ivy honors following the tournament, five receiving first-team honors and three receiving second.
Staller, Mills, Vloka, freshman Ben White and sophomore Shelby MacLeod were named to the first team, while Harmenberg, freshman Thomas Kolasa, and sophomore James Hawrot gained second-team recognition.
“Although the tournament could’ve gone better,” Mills said, “having so many teammates named All-Ivy was a good inspiration to the team.”
The result is particularly impressive considering the youth of the Harvard squad, comprised mostly of underclassmen.
“This year we have a really talented freshman class, with the remainder of the team mostly sophomores,” Mills added. “Hopefully these results will help us gain confidence for the rest of the season.”
Confidence will be a useful motivator as Harvard competes at the NCAA Regionals, held in Providence, R.I., and NCAA Tournament, in which the Crimson will serve as host for the first time in the program’s history.
With both crucial matches occurring in the upcoming weeks, this young Harvard team will have to put its best foot forward.
But for now, in the aftermath of the Ivy tournament, the squad has time to rest before gearing up for national competition.
“We really need to really take a little breather,” Brand said. “It’s a long season...so now we’re just going to try and recycle our energy and focus in national selection.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the season, the Harvard women’s basketball team has followed a similar progression in the course of a game: start slow, finish strong. But even without playing 40 minutes of perfect basketball, the Crimson has been able to find a way to win.
Last Friday night, it was another tale of two halves—a sloppy start followed by a solid second half—for Harvard (17-7, 7-2 Ivy), as it left Pizzatola Sports Center with a 65-54 win against host Brown (7-18, 4-7). The victory gave the Crimson its sixth-straight victory, and its seven wins in the Ivy League is second only behind Princeton.
“Brown is athletic and scrappy, and they’re that underdog with nothing to lose,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “They’re deep, they’re young, they’re athletic, and they play really hard. It’s a tough matchup for us because they’re stronger than their record shows for it.”
“It was a lot closer than it needed to be,” added freshman Victoria Lippert, who had eight points on the night. “But we picked it up, and we were able to close out when we needed to.”
The Bears held the advantage over the Crimson for most of the first half. After scoring the first five points of the game, Brown extended its lead to 11-5 in the next four minutes with a layup from forward Natalie Bonds, who had 11 points and 11 rebounds on the night. A series of turnovers and rushed offensive sets by Harvard would enable the Bears to pull ahead, 22-13, with seven minutes to go in the half.
But the Crimson would finally awake from its slumber, and as a result, ended the first half with a 14-2 run of its own to go up by five, 29-24.
Contributing to the slow start was the fact that junior forward Emma Markley found herself in foul trouble early on in the game. And though her minutes and numbers–21 minutes, 15 points, and seven rebounds–were far from extraordinary, her role as a sparkplug for the team helped her teammates every minute she was on the court.
“Emma’s a beast,” Lippert said. “She always brings this intensity that’s really contagious. Even though she was in foul trouble, the minute she was in, she was a huge contributor. She really makes it happen for us.”
Though having its leading scorer on the bench caused many of Harvard’s offensive woes, it was the 12 turnovers the Crimson amassed over the first half that allowed the Bears to stay in the game.
“If you look at the turnovers, it was really uncharacteristic of Christine [Matera] and Brogan [Berry],” Delaney-Smith said. “That’s just not how they’ve played all year. We took quick shots, rushed our offense, and that led to the turnovers.”
Though the Bears were able to crawl back into the game at the beginning of the second half by going on a 17-8 run, it was clear that Harvard had finally settled down and would play its brand of basketball to get the victory.
“We talked about that [at] halftime,” Delaney-Smith said. “We tried to run our sets and tried be a little more patient in our decision making, and I think that, as a result, we shot better.”
Sophomore Brogan Berry, who had 12 points in the game, came up big in the second half, as her trey put the Crimson back on top with just under three minutes to go.
An and-one from Markley and a pair of clutch free throws from freshman forward Miriam Rutzen and junior guard Jackie Alemany closed out the deal to end the game.
Even with an 11-point victory, Lippert was critical of her team’s play.
“It really wasn’t one of our best games,” Lippert said. “We played pretty poorly throughout. Brogan had some really nice feeds and and-ones, Christine hit a couple threes, and we were able to pull away, but on the whole, we have to do better than that.”
Delaney-Smith was much more sympathetic to her team’s performance.
“As you know, we’re kind of in what Harvard fondly calls ‘midterms season,’ and that’s always a consideration,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our hope is that we rise above that, and I think that we in fact did. Could we have done better? Yes, but when you’re on the road and you have all those considerations that you have right now, I was really pleased that we came out with the win.”

For the second year in a row, the Harvard men’s swimming and diving team finished second in the ECAC championships, coming in behind Navy by a 143-point margin.
“Navy’s got an awesome program, and they do a great job with their guys,” said Harvard assistant coach Kevin Tyrrell. “Those are the guys that we really have to watch out for, and those are the guys that we want to beat.”
A win would have been the third in the last four years in the championship, though Harvard went into the tournament with a disadvantage, bringing only 13 swimmers and a diver in a tournament that allows 18 total competitors.
Still, the Crimson finished 399.5 points ahead of Columbia, the eighth-place finishers and the closest Ivy League foe in the tournament. The Ivy League Championships take place next weekend at Princeton.
Harvard won three events during the three-day tournament—two relays and one individual race. Junior Evan Schindewolf won the 400-yard individual medley, swimming the event in 4:00.91, .43 seconds ahead of Navy freshman Benjamin Bondurant.
The Crimson also won the 800-yard freestyle relay, a combined effort from senior Rick McKellar, sophomore David Lynch, and freshmen Ryan Cutter and Brendan McIntee. Navy again finished second in the event, losing by a tenth of a second.
Cutter had the fastest split on the relay team, finishing his leg in 1:38.85. Tyrrell pointed out that he had never had a split faster than 1:41.
Harvard’s final victory was the 400-yard freestyle relay, the last event of the tournament, once again beating out Navy by a .71-second margin. McKeller had the second-fastest split in the race.
Tyrrell also emphasized McKeller’s role, along with that of senior Rob Lynch, in the team’s second-place effort.
“Rick McKeller and Rob Lynch...[have] done a nice job leading the program,” he said.
“Rob and Rick did a great job of making sure that the team was ready to swim this weekend,” Cutter added. “They set the bar pretty high, and they both did pretty great this weekend.”
Throughout the weekend, Harvard’s strongest finishes were in relays. Beyond the two relay victories, the team finished in second in the 200-yard medley relay and the 200-yard freestyle relay, falling to the University of Pittsburgh in both races.
“Before each race we said, ‘This is it, we’ve got to leave it all in the pool.’ We really just swam our hearts out,” Cutter said.
Still, neither race was particularly close—the Crimson finished .88 seconds behind in the 200 freestyle relay and nearly three seconds back of Pitt in the 200 medley relay.
In the 200 freestyle relay, McKeller, as the anchor, had the fastest split, swimming his leg in 20.35 seconds. He also finished third in the 100-yard butterfly and fourth in the 200-yard butterfly. Cutter and sophomore Ross Ford finished fifth and sixth, respectively, in the 200 fly.
Harvard also finished third in the 400-yard medley relay. McIntee had the fastest freestyle split in the finals of the relay, swimming his 100-yard leg in 45 seconds flat.
Though the Crimson had no individual victories other than Schindewolf’s Saturday win, it did have a number of close calls. For no one was this more true than for sophomore Nicholas DuCille.
In the 50-yard freestyle finals on Friday, DuCille lost to Navy freshman Robbie Parker by six one-hundredths of a second.
Yesterday, DuCille was again out-touched, this time by Bucknell University sophomore Eric Sokolosky in the 100-yard freestyle. DuCille finished the race in 45.60, losing by .02 seconds.
DuCille was not without his successes—he was also the freestyle anchor in the second-place 200 medley relay, where he had a 20.16-second split, the fastest in the finals. He led off in the winning effort in the 400-yard freestyle relay as well.
“[DuCille’s] continuing to work on [his] turns, trying to make those more efficient, but we’re just proud of the steps he’s taken to move forward,” Tyrell said.
Still, with the Ivy League Championships next weekend and with a relatively young team, Harvard looks at this as preparation.
“Our swims this weekend are really going to be motivational for our Ivy team, [and] hopefully they can do better than we did [in the ECAC tournament] at Ivies next weekend,” Cutter said.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 2, 2010
An original version of the Mar. 1 sports article "Harvard Men Take Second at ECACs" incorrectly referenced "Bryant University sophomore Eric Sokolosky." In fact, Sokolosky is a swimmer for Bucknell University.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping two close matches last week at Purdue and Indiana, the Crimson came out swinging this weekend against Boston College.
The Harvard men’s tennis team (5-4) encountered few difficulties as it cruised to a 5-2 victory over the Eagles (4-6) Friday night.
“There’s nothing like getting a ‘W,’ honestly,” Crimson coach Dave Fish ’72 said. “You can talk about learning from defeat and everything else...but if you look at any team, they take enough losses, it shakes the confidence.”
“I don’t think [the losses] affected us that much,” freshman Andy Nguyen said. “We felt confident in ourselves that we could win. There was no looking back at those matches.”
There certainly was no evidence of broken confidence on Friday, as Harvard played strong in all nine matches.
Despite losing the top doubles match, 8-3, the Crimson was able to earn the doubles point as sophomore Alistair Felton and Nguyen teamed up to win, 8-5, at No. 2, and junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans and freshman Joshua Tchan held on for an 8-6 victory at the No. 3 doubles spot.
“[BC’s] No. 1 doubles team is the No. 1 team in the region right now,” Fish said. “I thought we might be ready to take a shot at them, but they played great against us at No. 1. Fortunately, our No. 2 and No. 3 teams are really good. Our No. 3 team, which has lost a couple of matches against good competition, was able to save the day [today] by securing the doubles point.”
Harvard was able to secure most of the singles points without much difficulty, losing only at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots.
Junior Aba Omodele-Lucien came out strong at the three seed, making quick work of the first set, with a 6-0 win. But his opponent bounced back to win the next two sets, 6-1, 6-4.
“[Omodele-Lucien] has been playing in a spot in the lineup where he’s played pretty stiff competition and where there’s nowhere to hide,” Fish said. “He’s dropped a number of matches, and probably his confidence isn’t at the best place right now.”
Omodele-Lucien has gone 1-6 on the season while playing at the No. 2 and No. 3 spots.
“He won the first set and took a little bit of the pressure off [in the second],” Fish added. “That’s all the [Eagles’ player] needed to start the match rolling. Even at the end, [Omodele-Lucien] tied it up at four all and couldn’t quite do it.”
Chijoff-Evans continued his strong play at the No. 1 spot, winning the first set, 6-4. The second set wasn’t so simple. Tied up at 5-5, the set could have gone either way. But Chijoff-Evans was able to buckle down and clinch the match, winning the next two games.
“Alexei was in a little trouble in the second set—he really had to nail it down and dig deep to win,” Fish said.
Felton was unable to win at the second seed against a very tough opponent, losing in straight sets, 6-4, 6-4.
“We knew we were facing an uphill battle, and [the BC player] proved to be more consistent than Alistair,” Fish said. “Ali’s been playing well, and I think his game is moving in the right direction. I think we’ll continue to see him get a lot stronger this year.”
Nguyen was able to overcome a heavy-serving opponent and some mistakes to win the fourth spot, 6-3, 6-4.
“I knew that I wasn’t playing my best,” Nguyen said. “I wasn’t retuning as well as I should have...I had to fight through that, and I ended up doing pretty well.”
Freshman Christo Schultz was able to win the fifth seed in two straight sets, 6-4, 7-5, while captain Mike Hayes overcame a second-set lull to win in three sets, 6-2, 1-6, 6-1, at the final singles position.
“All in all, I was very pleased with the guys,” Fish said. “They’ve been working hard. I think we can continue to get better, but the Ivy League will be the real challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Heading into the final round of the 2010 Women’s Ivy League Championships on Saturday night at Blodgett Pool, it was an extremely close contest between defending champions Harvard (6-1 Ivy) and historically-dominant Princeton (7-0). Following two days of competition, the Tigers were leading the Crimson by a narrow margin of 982-944. The title, it seemed, would literally be decided in the final few races.
After Saturday morning’s preliminary rounds, Harvard was confident in its ability to put a blemish on Princeton’s perfect season and secure a second-consecutive Ancient Eight title in the process.
“It’s definitely really exciting,” said freshman Kelly Robinson following Saturday’s preliminary round. “In some races, Princeton’s got an edge; in some, we do. I really believe Harvard can pull through.”
Despite the Crimson’s efforts to match the Tigers stroke for stroke, a repeat performance of last year simply wasn’t in the cards for Harvard. Princeton ultimately stymied the Crimson’s quest for victory, prevailing with 1465 points and thus nabbing its 17th Ivy League championship in school history. Harvard concluded the weekend with a strong second-place finish, racking up 1438 points. Yale (1350), Penn (904.5), and Cornell (734) rounded out the top five.
“Our team fought until the very end, and I think that really showed,” Crimson junior Katherine Pickard said. “We never really gave up. We weren’t quite able to close the gap, but as heartbreaking as it was, it’s really motivated us. Twenty-seven points is nothing.”
During the final day of the three-day competition, Harvard co-captain Alexandra Clarke, junior Christine Kaufmann, and senior Katie Faulkner all swam among the top six times in the 1,650-yard freestyle.
The Crimson quartet of junior Katy Hinkle, freshman Kelly Robinson, junior Ali Slack, and Pickard completed the 400-yard freestyle relay in third place with a combined time of 3:24.94, behind the first-place Bulldogs (3:20.59) and second-place Tigers (3:22.46). Hinkle also posted an impressive third-place performance in the 100-yard freestyle with a time of 51.15 seconds.
Adding to Harvard’s high point total was junior Kate Mills, who edged out Yale’s Hayes Hyde to finish second in the 200-yard butterfly in 1:59.09. Mills’ teammates sophomore Hilary Roberts and senior Sophie Morgan also placed in the top eight in the race.
The Crimson’s diving contingent was also integral to the team’s strong finish. Junior Jennifer Reese, sophomore Leslie Rea, and freshman Teagan Lehrmann earned third, fourth, and seventh place, respectively, in the one-meter final.
Outstanding performances in the water explain only part of Harvard’s success at Ivies. Leadership outside of the pool was vital in boosting team morale, especially given the close points race with Princeton.
“If anything’s got to be said for great performances, [we have to acknowledge] the seniors on the team,” Pickard said. “They were great—truly the leaders. They really stepped up when it mattered.”
Combined, the Crimson and the Tigers have won the last 10 Ivy titles. But this weekend’s meet witnessed some exceptional finishes from other Ancient Eight athletes.
“Yale always has the potential to be a spoiler,” Robinson said, speculating about the outcome of the meet before the final round.
Indeed, Bulldog senior Susan Kim was named Swimmer of the Meet for her record-breaking performance Saturday morning in the 200-yard breaststroke. With a 2:09.38 finish, Kim shattered her own previous record of 2:12.17, establishing a new meet, Ivy, and pool record.
But not all of Harvard’s swimming and diving corps was present at Ivies this past weekend, as the Crimson also had a group of swimmers competing at the ECAC Championships in Pittsburgh, Penn.
Following two days of competition, the Crimson was ranked second overall in team standings at the ECAC Championships with 362.5 points, behind Marist’s 390. Juniors Holly Furman and freshman Camille Hendrix finished in the top eight of the 100-yard freestyle yesterday, with respective times of 52.10 and 52.74 seconds.
Though Harvard closed the gap in Sunday’s final, the Crimson ultimately fell short of the top spot, finishing just 11.5 points behind the Red Foxes.
The Harvard ECAC team is composed of mainly freshmen.
“It’s all about strategy,” Robinson, one of only three freshmen on the Ivies team, said. “We want to spread out our talent. But overall, the Ivy teams tend to be stronger, and there are many reasons behind that. The first season can be rocky for some freshmen, and they may just need more time to settle in. Experience is really important, so that’s why the Ivies team is junior- and senior-heavy.”
Whatever strategy the Crimson is applying seems to be working: last week, Harvard ranked first in the country in CollegeSwimming.com’s mid-major rankings. National recognition and steady leadership from the upperclassmen hold promise of another great season next year.
“We had a good season this year, but I think we’re all left wanting more,” Pickard said. “We’re not satisfied just yet. Hopefully next year, we’ll get back [to the top].”

The Crimson (5-4) hoped to improve its record after a disappointing 6-1 loss to Yale in the ECAC tournament semifinals two weeks ago. But this weekend Harvard was unable to follow through and leave the Midwest with a win.
Crimson coach Traci Green noted the importance of the weekend, despite the disappointing results.
“This trip by design was to prepare us for the Ivy season,” Green said. “It did that much.”
ILLINOIS 5, HARVARD 2
Despite a lopsided loss at the hands of the No. 39 Fighting Illini, the No. 53 Crimson put on a strong showing at the Atkins Tennis Center. Yesterday afternoon’s match saw many long points and tight sets from the Harvard athletes.
“We knew [Illinois] was going to be tough for us,” Green said. “Quite a few matches didn’t go our way, but overall we competed very well.”
To open the afternoon, freshman Kristin Norton and junior captain Samantha Rosekrans were blanked, 8-0, by Illini Chelcie Abajian and Rachael White.
The other two doubles teams also lost at the hands of their Illinois opponents, thereby giving the doubles point to the Illini.
The Crimson looked to the singles matches to turn things around.
At the No. 3 position, Norton gained Harvard’s first point as she swept her opponent in two sets, 6-4, 6-4.
In the No. 4 slot, Rosekrans and opponent Abajian swapped wins in the first two sets. Rosekrans took the first, 6-4, and Abajian easily captured the second, 6-0. The women were neck and neck through the beginning of the third, and at 5-3, it seemed as though Abajian was on the verge of a win. But Rosekrans persevered and turned her two-game deficit into a 7-5 win.
At the No. 1 position, No. 57 Holly Cao experienced her first singles loss of the season. Cao suffered her defeat after two close sets, losing 6-4, 6-3.
Despite her loss, Cao’s effort and dedication proved to have a large impact.
“Holly Cao played pretty well today, even though she lost,” Green said. “She played against a very tough opponent, and she really hung in there throughout her match. Her being on the court and persevering allowed Norton and Rosekrans to win their matches. It inspired them.”
Rosekrans alluded to this idea of teamwork in discussing her team’s strategy.
“[We’re trying to] feed off each other rather than playing individually, because that’s what a team does,” Rosekrans said. “We’re trying to get some solidarity going.”
At the No. 2 position, No. 115 sophomore Hideko Tachibana put forth a strong effort against No. 85 White. Tachibana lost a close first set, 6-4, and the second set saw potential for a comeback as the athletes swapped games, ultimately knotting the score at 5-5. But Tachibana could not hold on in the end, and she lost her second set, 7-5.
At No. 5, freshman Alexandra Lehman dropped her match in two sets, 6-3, 6-1. Sophomore Samantha Gridley likewise had a tough match at No. 6, losing 6-3, 6-2.
PURDUE 5, HARVARD 2
Coming into the match against unranked Purdue on Saturday, the Crimson felt confident in its skills and abilities. But the team came up short, garnering only two points from two singles victories.
“[The Boilermakers] were unranked, and we were going in as favorites,” Rosekrans said. “They brought everything they could. They had an amazing day, and I guess we weren’t prepared, so we lost the doubles point, which discouraged us going into singles. We came up short.”
In doubles, Rosekrans and Lehman teamed up for the sole victory, defeating Anna Dushkina and Remi Martin, 8-6.
At No. 1 singles, Cao continued her solid play, handily sweeping her opponent, 6-3, 6-1.
Norton in the No. 3 position served up the other singles win for Harvard, winning in three sets, 6-3, 0-6, 6-3.
Purdue’s athletes proved too much for Tachibana, Rosekrans, Lehman, and freshman Sophie Chang. The women all faced tough losses in their singles matches.
“This is all in preparation for the Ivy League season,” Rosekrans said. “It’s definitely good practice.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s basketball closes out its regular season on the road against the Killer P’s this weekend. The Crimson will look to secure a second place Ivy finish with a pair of victories.
So how do the teams match up? Penn sits at 4-7 in conference, Princeton at 8-3, and Harvard at 9-3.
But maybe more telling of how good the teams are is a statistic calculated by Harvard freshman John Ezekowitz.
Looking at team tempo and points scored and allowed per possession, Ezekowitz has developed a ranking system for Ivy League basketball teams. The statistic he uses is called a team’s Efficiency Margin.
The system for the most part validates the Ivy League standings, but it offers a little more detail into how strong the teams are.
In line with common knowledge, Cornell is by far the leader in the Ivies in efficiency margin at .28. Princeton’s efficiency margin is .15, barely above Harvard’s .13. After the top three teams, there is a major drop off. Brown, Yale, and Penn come in at -.04, -.05, and -.06, respectively. Columbia sits at -.14 and Dartmouth occupies the cellar at -.22.
Cornell boasts the leagues best offense at 1.16 points per possession and Princeton claims the league’s best defense with a league-low .87 points per possession. Harvard is the fastest playing team in the Ivies with adjusted tempo of 68.7 possessions per game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 4 Harvard women’s hockey team’s road to the ECAC tournament semifinals was smooth. 5-1 and 4-1 trouncings of Princeton gave the third-seeded Crimson a spot in the conference final four.
Rensselaer, on the other hand, did not have such an easy time of it.
The best-of-three series between fourth-seeded Quinnipiac and the fifth-seeded Engineers will go down as one of the most dramatic in ECAC history.
Friday night’s Game 1 got interesting when Bobcat Kallie Flor scored with just over five minutes to play in the game to tie the score at one. 8:46 into double overtime, her teammate Chelsea Illchuk lit the lamp to give Quinnipiac a 2-1 victory.
Though Saturday’s Game 2 was decided in regulation, it was just as tight a contest—Rensselaer came away with a 1-0 win on the strength of an Alisa Harrison power-play tally.
But none of that compared to the drama of Game 3.
With their seasons on the line—the winner promised a place in the conference semis, and the loser sent home—each squad left everything on the ice.
Regulation ended, again, with the score knotted at one after a late-game Quinnipiac tally. Overtime after overtime passed with nothing to add to the score sheet except more saves for the Engineers’ Sonja van der Bliek and the Bobcats’ Victoria Vigilanti.
And finally, in the fifth overtime, Rensselaer captain Laura Gersten put an end to things.
The senior took a pass from Whitney Naslund and put the puck just over Vigilanti’s glove—a shot that hit the crossbar and dropped straight down, causing a deliberation amongst the officials, who eventually ruled it a goal.
Van der Bliek finished with 49 saves while Vigilanti recorded 57. It was the longest NCAA-sponsored women’s hockey game in history at 145 minutes, just 1:03 shy of breaking the record set by the 1996 ECAC Championship game between New Hampshire and Providence.
Now the Engineers—led by Gersten, who also scored the overtime game-winner in last year’s ECAC semifinal, when Rensselaer upset top-seeded Harvard, 3-2—advance to play No. 1 seed Cornell in Friday’s semifinal matchup, while Quinnipiac heads home heartbroken.
The Crimson will travel to Potsdam, N.Y. on Friday to take on second-seeded Clarkson. The semifinal winners will advance to Sunday’s championship game, which will be hosted by the highest-remaining seed.

Remember those days when family night consisted of actually going to the video store and renting a movie for the evening?
Now that iTunes and Netflix are taking over that tradtion, stores like Quick-Flix—currently the only movie rental store in Harvard Square—are being forced to close shop.
As Michael Bradley, the owner of Quick-Flix, wrote on the company’s Web site, “Due to the direction of the industry, and growing trends of on demand/streaming we have been left with little choice but to recognize the sunset on our path.”
On the bright side, their sunset is a college student’s sunshine. Since its closure, Quick-Flix closure has been having an “Everything Must Go” sale, selling movie DVDs at $4.99 each and TV series DVDs for $9.99 each.
Many TV series are still on the shelves, such as “Grey’s Anatomy," “Scrubs,” “The Office,” and “24.” In the mood for some Jackie Chan?  “Shanghai Nights” was still there at 7 p.m. today. Or, if you’re looking for a classic college movie to watch with roommates this weekend, “National Lampoon's Van Wilder” hasn't been snagged either.
But now that Quick-Flix is on its way out, what will take its place? Well, Bradley wants to know too. He is soliciting suggestions through the Quick-Flix Web site, so if you think there is something Harvard Square desperately needs, here’s your chance to make your voice heard!

The H-bomb is strong, at least according to PayScale, a global online compensation  data company. It turns out that Harvard graduates can boast the second-highest mid-career  median salary, tied with MIT for $126,000. Only kids from Dartmouth  make more mid-career bank.
But the surprises don't end yet. Apparently philosophy majors earn more  10 years after college than business administration and nursing majors—but you'd still be better off in engineering. Aerospace, chemical,  computer, and electrical engineering swept first through fourth places on the list of highest-earning undergraduate degrees.
Al Lee, director of quantitative analysis at PayScale, said he believes that for the majority of Americans who don't attend elite schools, “the degree you get is a bigger influencer of your pay” than where you went to college.  But if you get your giggles from Gatsby, don’t  trade in the Barker Center for the Science Center just yet. Lee acknowledges  that an English major from Harvard could end up making six figures—still, he insists that such a case would be an exception.
Not only that, but 2 of the 10 most popular jobs held  by Harvard University grads are executive director of a nonprofit organization  and high school teacher. So if that career as a CEO doesn’t pan out, never  fear. When all else fails, the whales will still need saving.
