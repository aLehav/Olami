After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last month, on Vincent van Gogh’s 167th birthday, an anonymous thief stole an early van Gogh painting from a small museum in the Netherlands. The museum’s alarm went off at 3:15 a.m. The police found nothing but shards of glass. Only one painting, van Gogh’s “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring,” was stolen.
I know this is not how art heists work, but I like the thought of the robber taking his van Gogh back to a flat in Amsterdam, maybe hanging it above his gold enameled fireplace. He can appreciate it, wine in hand, while he self isolates. I want for him to look at his prize, to squint to see it better, to hum in studious approval. The thief has a van Gogh now, and it is a van Gogh only he can access. I want him to admire his conquest.
Even if the thief hadn’t stolen “The Parsonage Garden,” after all, no one else could have looked at it. The Singer Laren has been empty for weeks. Its director shut down the building on March 13. The thief made his heist into a void — he went through the motions of art theft to obtain an item already robbed of its function. “Every piece of art that is stolen from a public museum is art that is stolen from society,” the director of the Groninger Museum — which owns the van Gogh — told the New York Times. But what is society supposed to do with a van Gogh right now? Do we mail it from house to house, wiping it down with Clorox in between? There’s something lonely about stealing an abandoned painting. The hyper-connectivity of the art world has been truncated. As art trade hibernates, heists feel passé.
Meanwhile, back at home, the many quarantiners who haven’t stolen a van Gogh recently are left pretending that facsimiles of art can match art itself. If you can’t have the real “Parsonage Garden,” the party line goes, virtual will do. While the internet has always offered a glut of art content, now it offers the only art content, and even organizations that preach the value of live media have capitulated. Instead of peddling human interaction, museums update their Instagrams. The world is ending. Internet art, like low-calorie ice cream or low-budget cover songs, will have to suffice.
So, if digital art is ascending and the physical art trade is on lockdown, why steal a van Gogh during a pandemic?
In order for this heist to make sense, two things must be true. First, the thief must believe that original paintings offer something the internet cannot. He must believe there is something in a painting’s scope, or its texture, or its image quality, that renders original art distinctive. He must believe that people go to museums for more than spectacle and overpriced sandwiches — that the museum industry is (or was) thriving because people like tangible artwork.
But second — and maybe more importantly — the thief must also assume a future where people can go to museums once again. Good robbers only steal things with worth, and paintings are worthless if no one can look at them. Art is difficult to resell after theft; a global lockdown only complicates a heist’s dynamics. In context, the van Gogh robbery is optimistic. The heist suggests the thief bet his life on a future post-apocalypse. He comitted a felony for a prize that will accrue value solely once the public can leave the house. A person steals a van Gogh during a pandemic if and only if he believes the pandemic will end.
I hope the robber is right, and that his van Gogh appreciates until he can sell it on a bustling black market connected by international flights and in-person handshakes. I hope even more, however, that the Singer Laren recovers the painting before the world reopens. The thief stole a strange, bleak image: The “spring” of the title is hard to find in “The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring.” Instead of flowers, van Gogh outlines a captivating, witch-ish figure staring straight out at the viewer. But the photo on the New York Times website is grainy and hard to judge. The painting’s greenery, just visible against the sepia backdrop, might be muted by its digitization.
The thief is lucky, and not just because he got to leave the house and go to a museum. I’m sure “The Parsonage Garden” looks brighter in person.

Mitski, a Japanese-American indie artist, is not exactly what you would call a household name. For those unfamiliar with her work, Mitski’s lyrics are nostalgia-tinged and sweetly forlorn, her sound ranging from ballads accompanied by stripped-down piano to pop powered by electric guitar riffs. Despite borrowing many sonic elements from the typical indie repertoire, Mitski gracefully avoids the one-dimensional affectation of constant suffering that often defines the genre. Instead, she stands out from her peers by writing genuine yet simple lyrics that capture the minutiae of any given emotion with startling precision. In particular, her 2016 album “Puberty 2” received considerable critical praise for its autobiographical tone and careful self-reflection. From that album sprang the single titled “Your Best American Girl,” a rumination on a past relationship for which Mitski was willing to sacrifice parts of her own identity despite knowing that the differences between her and her partner were too vast to bridge. Today, a second look at the song’s powerful music video is in order — and nearly four years later, its themes and motifs have never been more influential.
With the first languid strums of guitar, the video for “Your Best American Girl” opens to a shot of Mitski perched on a stool at the center of a dimmed room, her bright magenta suit the only splash of color against an otherwise achromatic set. She lifts her eyes to find a stereotypically handsome white man gazing at her, enraptured. Brief clips alternate between solo shots of Mitski and her love interest as they smile at each other, wave, and grow increasingly flirtatious in body language. Nevertheless, in spite of this immediate intimacy fostered by the frontal close-ups on each of the characters, there’s also an oddly contradictory sense of distance present, fueled by the realization that the couple never appears together in the same frame.
This division comes to a head when Mitski croons “you’re the sun, you’ve never seen the night,” subtly hinting at a fundamental incompatibility between herself and her love interest. These feelings appear to be validated when a white woman dressed like she’s on the way to Coachella slinks into the frame, wraps her arm around the man’s shoulders, and abruptly steals his attention. Suddenly, the exchange of gazes is no longer occurring between Mitski and her love interest, but rather between Mitski and this new competitor. If the other woman – in the full glory of a fringed crop top, flower crown, and temporary metallic arm tattoos – is a satirical visualization of Americana, then perhaps this exchange of stares represents Mitski’s yearning to fit into white culture eclipsing her initial attraction to her love interest. All the while, Mitski’s hand remains suspended in midair, still waving jerkily as if to highlight the one-sidedness of their relationship.
As the white couple begins to embrace, Mitski looks to her still-waving hand, brings it to her face, and begins to make out with it, all while twining her free hand through her hair and gripping her own chin as if mimicking the actions of a lover. At first glance, it seems that perhaps Mitski is intensely jealous of the other couple and is merely seeking out her own hand as a substitute for human interaction. However, the explosion of the mellow, lazy verse into a triumphant chorus — “Your mother wouldn’t approve of how my mother raised me, but I do, I think I do” — just as Mitski kisses her hand invites an alternate interpretation. Rather than a pitiful attempt to ward off loneliness, Mitski making out with her own hand constitutes an aggressively confident act of self-love through the solo recreation of physical gestures that are typically associated with romantic, interpersonal affection.
After this ritual of self-reconciliation, Mitski smiles, picks up her guitar, and strums it until the end of the song, when she simply walks off the set without looking back at the white couple — who are presumably still wrapped up in each other within a literal American flag. Quite simply, she now loves herself enough to leave behind a boy who had no place for her in his life, as well as the preoccupations with white culture that came with him.
A renewed discussion of Mitski’s “Your Best American Girl” music video and its bittersweet portrayal of an attempt at an interracial relationship is especially pertinent now, in the wake of the 2018 Netflix hit “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before.” It serves as an important counterpoint to the saccharine love story between Lara Jean Covey (Lana Condor), a mixed Korean-American girl, and Peter Kavinsky (Noah Centineo), a white boy: The fact that the couple is interracial is never explicitly addressed in the film, which is a lighthearted, feel-good tale of first love. Nevertheless, the rosy image that the Netflix film paints — of being able to enter successful relationships with people of any race without encountering any miscommunications or imbalances stemming from differences in ethnic background — does not often occur in real life, and Mitski’s “Your Best American Girl” stunningly portrays the struggles that a person of color may encounter in their relationship with white American culture.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Just over a month ago, Harvard University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced that Harvard would fully transition to virtual instruction by Monday, March 23. This remarkable feat was possible thanks to “a group of extremely dedicated people … working literally around the clock to respond to challenges posed by COVID-19,” according to Bacow’s email.
As a Harvard graduate student with a chronic autoimmune disease — and thus at high risk of getting very sick from COVID-19 — I appreciate this decisive action and similar ones made by other institutions. At the same time, the efficient responses and executions offer a painful contrast to the daily indifference long endured by people with disabilities.
It only takes one single email announcement from the administration to change how more than 36,000 people in the Harvard community live and learn. Yet, as an advocate for people with disabilities, I am keenly aware that there is no amount of advocacy work that would manifest such accommodations for us, let alone see them enacted in a single day. COVID-19 has revealed the truth: We have been entirely capable of making the accommodations people with disabilities demanded all along. The lack of will to do so is ableism.
When I was paralyzed from the waist down in my first year at Wellesley College, my 58-year-old mother carried me to class up a hill and a long flight of stairs. I would have to retake the course next semester if I had another absence because of my lupus flare-up. The writing program policy makes no distinctions between excused and unexcused absences so it did not matter that I was in the emergency room last night, and in too much physical pain to concentrate and participate. The policy was firm — affirming the only valid form of presence as visible and physical while denying all unseen values that make us present: the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual.
At Harvard, I have had to drop a course deeply meaningful to me because similar policies were enforced: I would lose half a grade for each missed class. While I do not plan on being absent and understand that such policies intend to create a committed community, my disabled body can neither give nor learn from such a commitment. I cannot and do not wish to master, overcome, and transform my body. I can and must live with my lupus, accept my body, and ask to be accepted as I am.
Unfortunately, such stories are not unique. Most workplaces do not think seriously about access. The consistent message that people with chronic illnesses receive is: “If you feel sick, DO come to work.” People with disabilities who request accommodations often hear the following: that there are significant technological challenges to overcome; that we are burdening others with additional labor; that to make an exception for us would be unfair to those who need none. In a society where everyone is susceptible to COVID-19, the absence of these excuses indicates that the only reason has been ableism, plain and simple. As workplaces and institutions are transitioning with such speed to virtual communities, it is clear that we have been equipped for the technological challenges, that everyone can familiarize themselves with alternative platforms, that it has always been possible to assess students fairly without timed physical exams that favor able-bodies, and that it was never unfair to demand resources and access that account for our physical realities.
Though responses to COVID-19 reveal the structures of exclusion, they have also unveiled all bodies as what bodies are — vulnerable, malleable, and hoping to live. When we are forced to envision the disturbing possibility that all bodies can fall ill and become disabled, we can no longer conceive the only body as the able body and label others as frightening and defective or special and inspirational. We must recognize that with or without COVID-19, all bodies experienced disability at birth and many will again in their lifetime in a society where access is not a priority. When I could not walk, I was not disabled until policies designed for able-bodies demanded my physical presence in the classroom and failed to consider widely-available technology like Zoom that could have brought the classroom to me in bed. The body does not disable. Society’s unwillingness to accommodate the imperfect body is what discriminates and disables. Once we understand this, our response can begin to look like what access should have been all along.
Here is my dream: That for each change towards inclusion we make in response to COVID-19, we commit to exploring how it can continue to remain in effect for people with disabilities after COVID-19. COVID-19 may pass, but no scientist is working on a cure for the pandemic of ableism. The actions towards inclusion that stem from your panic are all we have — and all we need.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Universal basic income — a monthly payment to everyone sufficient to meet basic needs — could end poverty overnight. But the question remains: can we do it? Implementation is straightforward: an account at the Federal Reserve for every American based on existing Social Security information would make it simple to deposit payments for all, among other benefits discussed here. But a monthly UBI of $1000 for adults and $500 for children, which would bring almost all Americans above the federal poverty line, has a $3.4 trillion annual price tag — how do we pay for it?
When we ask, “can we fund UBI?” we should be thinking about real resources, not money. If we think of UBI as a payment designed for everyone to be able to meet their basic needs, then the question of feasibility is twofold: are there enough resources to actually meet everyone’s basic needs and can we universally allocate those resources?
As I argued in my column “The Myth of Taxpayer Money,” federal spending is limited only by self-imposed rules and constraints on real resources. UBI will be funded the exact same way as all government programs—money created out of thin air. Economist Stephanie Kelton has concluded that “taxation and bond sales are technically incapable of financing government spending and that modern governments actually finance all of their spending through the direct creation of high-powered money.” Though some Harvard students objected to this conclusion; I remain convinced.
You may be concerned that UBI will add to government debt, but really this number is a measure of the amount of government-issued financial assets and must increase for the economy to grow. United States debt is not a liability in the traditional sense; to quote former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan, “there is zero probability of default” on U.S. debt. For a full monetary sovereign like the U.S., the amount of debt it issues is just a matter of policy. Furthermore, proposals such as minting a trillion-dollar coin or simply permitting direct financing would allow the U.S. to spend without issuing debt.
So we have the money — do we have the resources? Absolutely — we actually have surpluses. Fewer than 2 percent of American laborers work on farms and 40 percent of food produced in the U.S. is wasted, yet the average American in 2010 consumed 2,507 calories a day, up 22 percent from 1970. About 550,000 people experienced homelessness at least one night in 2018, the same year over 16 million housing units were empty at any given time. And when’s the last time you went to buy gas, clothes, or school supplies and the stores had run out? For most Americans, the answer is never (before this pandemic, anyway).
This occurs despite the American economy running well below its potential. According to the Fed itself, capacity utilization, which is “how much capacity is being used from the total available capacity to produce demanded finished products,” has remained below 80 percent since the 2008 financial crisis. We are underproducing output worth trillions of dollars, yet still producing a surplus of goods.
We have the resources, but can we get them to the people who need them? Luckily, human civilization has spent the last few centuries building up global supply chains. The global market economy makes it easy for people to exchange money for desired goods and services. It is important to note that demand must come first; producers don’t produce unless they think they’ll have someone to sell to.
The fundamental issue with the market is that people without money can’t participate; they have no ability to signal to producers to provide what they need. With UBI, everyone has a voice in the market. This would lead to less waste of basic goods we already produce and would spur producers to utilize excess capacity.
But won’t this cause inflation? Not necessarily. We have real-world evidence of a rising money supply increasing economic development without causing runaway inflation. China’s M2 money supply grew by almost 800 percent in 20 years, but matching GDP growth kept inflation low. A $1000 to $2000 universal yearly oil dividend in Alaska has been doled out for decades and actually reduced inflation. Recently, a $10 million cash transfer experiment in Kenya grew the local GDP by $2.60 for every dollar invested, with negligible inflation. A UBI in the U.S. obviously has key differences from each of these examples, but they disprove the idea that “money printing equals inflation.”
When we realize that we are under-consuming the goods we already produce and that this level of production is well below our potential, it is easy to see that there is plenty of room in the economy for a basic income without causing inflation. A market economy needs money to function properly; right now, we are starving our economy to the detriment of us all.
Perhaps you still think that spending will exceed production after all and inflation will run rampant. But we must remember that the Fed’s job is combating inflation, and if the Fed’s tools can’t control inflation, it can provide interest to money stored in Americans’ Fed accounts and incentivize saving to reduce spending. And, if we run into a major emergency, Congress can pass taxes to drain money from the economy.
I cannot produce every detail of the perfect UBI plan, nor can I guarantee that it will work. But I believe that it is doable and far easier than one might expect. The money and the method only require political will. We have plenty of resources; we’re just missing the money that can get them from producers to the American people. Universal basic income is the final piece to the puzzle that makes the economy work — and work for everyone.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 2020 United States census is underway. If you’re an undergraduate that lived on-campus pre-COVID-19, you’re all set — the Census Bureau has established a program that allows college students who’d normally be living on-campus right now to be counted through their universities, despite the recent mass exodus of students from their college dorms.
Historically, college students have been a difficult group to accurately account for, with students often counted in both their college addresses and their parents' addresses. COVID-19 has posed additional challenges, forcing the U.S. Census Bureau to suspend field operations and on Monday, to request Congress approve a four-month delay in the 2020 count.
The U.S. Census Bureau's decision to delay the 2020 census amid incredibly confounding circumstances only makes sense. The U.S. census is of paramount importance. It determines federal and state funding, which in 2015 alone, amounted to over 675 billion dollars. Census data is used by researchers, companies, and policymakers alike. Maintaining the integrity of this data is crucial to ensure that governmental and private sector actors at least have the option of making decisions based on the country’s demographic reality.
Congressional apportionment, per the Constitution's mandate, is also based upon census data; state redistricting typically is as well. As such, undercounting can have very negative functional effects. Racial and ethnic minorities such as black and Hispanic populations, as well as Native Americans living on reservations, have been historically undercounted, which has resulted in both a loss of federal funding and political representation for these groups. Though the administration of the 2020 census has been complicated by COVID-19, it is imperative that the U.S. Census Bureau not neglect its efforts to mitigate these inaccuracies as it weathers unexpected challenges.
The Census Bureau's new policy for counting college students presents further representation-related conundrums. College students may spend the majority of the year on campus and regularly use their college town's public services (think public transit). However, most of us vote in our hometowns. Counting all college students that typically reside in on-campus housing as residents of where they go to school likely inflates the political representation of college towns, as a sizable chunk of their residents don’t vote there.
While in liberal Cambridge this may not be a major issue, many universities have student bodies with more progressive politics than the perhaps rural, conservative towns these schools reside in. In such a scenario, college students are “represented” by politicians with agendas often distinct from their own. In light of these electoral issues, the multipurpose nature of the U.S. census — to both administer federal funds and determine political representation — begs for more critical thought.
Moreover, Harvard’s decision to have students vacate campus in response to coronavirus should remind us that our residency in Cambridge is not guaranteed. In times of acute crisis, most of us head home; those of who stayed had to apply for the chance to do so. Though we all are beneficiaries of many of Cambridge’s services and resources, most of us ultimately define our permanent residency elsewhere.
The challenges of administering the census during the coronavirus pandemic have demonstrated the anachronistic nature of using a traditional headcount of the population even with the availability of modern statistical sampling methods. The system isn’t perfect, and quite frankly, we haven’t reached a consensus on how to fix it. Though in the long term we must look to address the systemic inequities inherent in the current census methodology, for this year we urge community members to continue to fill out the census and ensure that they are counted.

When Christopher R. Hansen swipes into Gund Hall each morning, he is one of only a handful of people to enter the building. Aside from the occasional footsteps of a security guard or custodian, all he hears is the whirr of the dozens of 3D printers in the Fabrication Lab. Since the start of April, his new routine has consisted of slicking on gloves, reprogramming the printers there, and delivering the products to a loading dock in Longwood.
As a Digital Fabrication Technical Specialist, Hansen trains students to use the lab’s digital tools for prototyping. In recent weeks, he’s taken on a different project: helping the Graduate School of Design produce personal protective equipment for local hospitals.
The GSD’s efforts began as a response to Massachusetts General Hospital’s call for masks, gowns, and respirators. Speaking on NBC in mid-March, the president of MGH said the hospital was “desperate” for shipments and urged companies with 3D printers to start manufacturing masks that afternoon. This call-to-action led many GSD students to contact Stephen M. Ervin, the assistant dean for information technology, about using the Fabrication Lab’s own fleet.
At Ervin’s approval, the lab joined the Massachusetts General Brigham Center for COVID Innovation, a consortium of Boston-area groups working to combat shortages in medical supplies. According to Hansen, MGB committed to making their designs “open-source,” meaning that anyone can use and distribute them. The MGB Center provided the Harvard team with an approved design for a face shield: Pinned to each thick, white visor is a curved, chin-length sheet of polyethylene terephthalate glycol. he shield not only protects its wearers’ faces from infectious droplets but prevents contamination of precious N-95 respirators, which are low in supply.
Eric Hӧweler, an associate professor of architecture who helps advise the Harvard team, says the design is clever because of its simplicity. The shield relies on a cheap, common plastic sheet that can be bought at Staples and sterilized with alcohol.
Within two weeks, the face shield passed clinical safety tests at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard administrators approved use of the Fabrication Lab, and the team began printing hundreds of visors and shields.
Since April 5, the GSD has produced 3,500 visors and 1,000 shields using rolls of plastic filaments found in the lab.
But the GSD is unlikely to produce more shields, as it will soon run out of its stock of PETG. As Ervin explains, many universities, hospitals, and companies are driving up the demand for the material, just as the MGB Center predicted, making it difficult, if not impossible, to acquire more.
Until the consortium finds another supply, the team will focus on a second product: a novel 3D printed intubation hood.
Hansen is excited to show us prototypes of the hood, which shields doctors from contact with viral particles their patients may emit during intubation. He screen-shares slides over Zoom detailing the many iterations the design has gone through, starting with a clear plastic box with two holes and ending with an accordion-like cover that extends over the patient and retracts when not in use.
Hospitals are in need of intubation hoods that can be implemented as early as April 18 — a remarkably quick turnaround, Hansen says. He explains that the team is working on a “quick and dirty solution” for next week and a “more refined solution for further down the road.”
According to Hӧweler, team members are designing in two weeks projects that they would likely have spent two years on under more normal circumstances; they constantly exchange feedback on prototypes in Slack channels and Zoom calls.
Without modern technology like 3D printing and online communication, the GSD’s efforts would have been impossible. The ability to share designs and work together virtually has changed the process of creating designs, allowing frequent collaboration between clinicians, architects, and engineers.
Hӧweler believes that the lab’s set of 150 3D printers will “patch a gap that is painfully obvious in hospitals.” Nonetheless, he expects the GSD’s production of PPE to be “a one-time thing.” While industrial processes can create 1000 face shields per hour, a 3D printer can only create one shield every seven hours. Despite this disparity, he is inspired by the way people have been coming together to do their part amidst the crisis.
“Hundreds of people have their own 3D printers, and they’re printing and donating,” he says. “It’s a fantastic story. It means that we can make a difference.”

If there’s anything the past month of self-isolation has given me, it’s time — alone time, time to think about quarantine, and time to think about a story I want to retell:
James Lovelock was at a loss. After years working for NASA on a project exploring the possibility of life on Mars, he’d encountered a question he couldn’t quite answer: What exactly made the atmosphere of Earth different from that of our sibling planets, and how is ours kept so stable? How has our planet been so suited to life for billions of years, while Mars remains sterile and barren?
Then, one afternoon in 1965, it hit him. Recalling the moment in a book years later, he wrote, “My mind was well prepared emotionally and scientifically and it dawned on me that somehow life was regulating climate as well as chemistry. Suddenly the image of the Earth as a living organism able to regulate its temperature and chemistry at a comfortable steady state emerged in my mind.”
This would later become known as the Gaia hypothesis: a theory which proposes that Earth can be best understood as a single living organism, modifying its planetary environment to produce the conditions necessary for its survival. In this single being, various organic and inorganic components work in unison to form a self-regulating complex system, seeking an optimal physical and chemical environment for life. In other words, Earth is not just the home of life as we know it; it is, in some meaningful sense, alive.
The name was suggested by Lovelock’s friend William Golding, author of “The Lord of the Flies,” who lived in the same town as him. Gaia was the Greek goddess who personified Earth and was understood to be the ancestral mother of all life, perhaps known more commonly as “Mother Earth.”
In 1971, while fleshing out the initial hypothesis and fitting it to established concepts, Lovelock was joined by Lynn Margulis, a biologist and evolutionary theorist famous for advancing the now-widely accepted theory of symbiogenesis: an evolutionary theory holding that prokaryotes in symbiotic relationships formed the first eukaryotic cells. In other words, she worked to show that multiple living organisms could, through close cooperation, become mere component parts of a greater, living organism. Her initial paper was rejected by about 15 scientific journals, as she remembers. Yet decades later, the theory would enter the mainstream.
The Gaia hypothesis, which she would go on to champion alongside Lovelock throughout the twentieth century, still faces sharp scrutiny today. Critics point out that a basic criterion of life is an origin rooted in natural selection and an ability to replicate and pass on genetic information to offspring, while the Earth clearly didn’t come from planets and can’t create more planets. Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould succinctly criticizes the Gaia hypothesis as describing “a metaphor, not a mechanism.”
But at a time like this, in the midst of a global pandemic, the importance of metaphor can’t be overstated. I can’t make any claim to the scientific utility of Gaia, but I can present an argument for its social utility: Gaia posits that life sustains itself through self-regulation, and as a threat to life is emerging, a regulatory response is demanded.
Confronting COVID-19 successfully requires us to develop a constant and severe sense of social responsibility, understanding the choice not to wash one’s hands or practice social distancing as not just a question of personal risk tolerance but instead a question of epidemiological momentum. Any given death reported on the news could be traced back through an unknowable number of transmission events, eventually implicating someone whose mortal sin was as vapid and commonplace as touching a door handle minutes after a forgotten cough, shunning social distancing guidelines to see an old friend, or deeming a late-night ice cream run “essential business” (as I’m often tempted to do).
Even when we feel fine, long incubation periods and the potential for entirely asymptomatic cases endow our every action with potentially fatal outcomes, often borne not by ourselves, but by a more-vulnerable stranger many stages of transmission later.
We’re interdependent far beyond the limits of conceptualization; as is the case with sets of long numbers and infinite possibilities, the human brain struggles to hold within it the magnitude and reality of exponential spread. In light of this, public health officials use simple metaphors to engender social responsibility — imagining spending time indoors as ‘flattening the curve,’ or a country as ‘waging war’ against an invisible enemy.
Yet the metaphor I keep returning to is Gaia, far removed from its biochemical and ecological origins. The metaphor suggests that life, despite its many faces, is a singular noun, a project in which we’re all partaking. From this perspective, that which threatens the most vulnerable in society threatens ourselves. Even if our particular body isn’t at risk, our life is — the life we experience as a constituent, interdependent component of Gaia.
In my more cynical moments, the metaphor begins to feel corny at best, and pseudoscientific at worst. Yet its utility, and the fact of our interdependence, remains. The butterfly effect isn’t just a possibility here — it’s an inevitability — and those who rely on me most are likely those I’ve never met, yet am inextricably connected to.
The use of Gaia as a metaphor to confront such existential threats isn’t new; entire books have been written using the hypothesis to conceive of climate change and rapid human influence on a planet prone to feedback loops and adaptive responses. But a pandemic, in particular, makes apparent the easily-forgotten fact that our spheres of influence are universal in nature. Epidemiology is, in a sense, quantifying the extent of this connectedness, and now we’re tasked to recognize it.
But beyond fostering social responsibility, the metaphor of Gaia could offer us the stamina to endure this unprecedented social and economic ice age. I’ve tried to keep interdependence in mind as I’ve spent that past month living in quarantine, isolated from literally everyone I know, apart from my two roommates.
Though I deeply appreciate their company, I’m beginning to feel we’re more like fellow lighthouse keepers than friends, the three of us stranded on the remote, stony island that is our first-floor apartment while a biblical month-long storm that can neither be seen nor heard traps us perpetually indoors. All we can do is wait it out, co-regulating each other’s quarantine-induced neuroticism in our own sort of homeostatic system that harkens back to Gaia herself, trying to bear in mind the reason we’re doing this in the end: to sustain life.
A lighthouse keeper endures such isolation as a public service, a burden made entirely bearable on account of its utility, saving the life of sailors who have never met the lone keeper yet depend entirely on their service. In this same spirit, living in quarantine can be correctly understood as an uncomfortable yet intrinsically life-saving endeavor. Distancing from each other is crucial not in spite of, but precisely on account of, our fundamental interdependence and the impact we can have on even those we’ll never meet.
Maybe the Gaia model of Earth as a single organism is an oversimplification drawn more from Lovelock’s science-fiction background than empirical biology, yet its implications for human society hold unique value at this moment — even in isolation, we’re reminded every day how connected we are. This crisis (along with the compounding climate crisis to come) casts us not as protectors of an “I” but instead a collective “we.” In order to save ourselves, we’ll need to stay in our lighthouses a bit longer.

My baby Keith, you’ve always looked like a baby. You looked like a baby when you were born, and you looked like a baby when you died. When you were four, you had big eyes, loose, little curls on top of your head, smooth skin, full cheeks, and thin lips curled into a smile. When you were 32, you still had those big eyes and loose little curls. But your cheeks were gaunt. Your skin was scaly and spotted purple. Still, with an oval head crowned by a tuft of hair, you looked like a baby.
My baby Keith, even when you were purple, you acted like a baby. You left this world the same way you entered it: nonjudgmental, pure of mind, seeing the world with a simple, singular clarity. At your funeral, your younger sister, Kay Haring said, “​My memories growing up with Keith are very much like remembering what he was like just yesterday.​” You were always playful with Kay, even when those plum spots came and drained away all your energy, even when you were days away from being just another purple baby buried in the ground.
My baby Keith, baby was your social philosophy. It was your art. You drew babies more than you drew anything else. You drew the Radiant Baby — a little yellow jelly bean crawling on its hands and knees, protected by a circle of radiating lines. “Babies represent the possibility of the future, the understanding of perfection, how perfect we all could be. There is nothing negative about a baby ever​,” you said in an interview when asked about all the drawings of all the babies. You wanted to share your philosophy — the philosophy of babies — with everyone. During your first few months in New York in 1978, you rode the subway, handing out buttons emblazoned with your Radiant Baby to passengers. You gave those yellow buttons to anyone and everyone, because babies are nonjudgmental, “​a clean plate of pure love​.” People never refused the yellow button with the Radiant Baby because it was so simple, so innocent.
My baby Keith, you wanted to be part of something for as long as you could remember. So, when you were fourteen, you joined the Jesus Saves movement.​ ​All the art you made at that time was Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. You committed all your time to it. But just for a year. And then you got bored. So, you started doing drugs because drugs were another way of belonging. You’d smoke pot and drink with kids you had just met before going to school. You loved Angel Dust. Often, your old friends would find you stumbling around town, speaking nonsense to yourself.
My baby Keith, eventually you stopped doing drugs. You graduated from high school in 1976 and went to a commercial arts school in Pittsburgh. But there was nothing to belong to in Pittsburgh. After six months, you quit. “​I wanted intensity for my art, and I wanted intensity for my life​,” you said. “Obviously, the only place to go was New York”
My baby Keith, you found something to be part of in New York. Actually, Keith, you found several things to be part of. Namely: Christopher Street, graffiti, the East Village, punk and New Wave music, bathhouses, Club 57, and fucking. Lots and lots of fucking.
But my baby Keith, all of these things were fleeting. What you really became a part of in New York, what you became deeply imbricated with, what you became irremovably fixed to, was cold hard cash. Capitalism, my baby. You did advertisements for Swatch and Absolut Vodka — Radiant Babies checking the time, Radiant Babies crawling around a handle of Sweden’s finest, Radiant Babies inside a pack of Lucky Strikes. Maybe this was always where the Radiant Baby was headed. You did, after all, get the idea for those yellow buttons after coming to New York and seeing how people kept their museum stickers on for hours after leaving the Met or MoMA. Those stickers functioned like little status symbols, and the Radiant Baby did too. The Radiant Baby wasn’t just meant to be your social philosophy. It was also meant to be your logo.
My baby Keith, in 1986, you opened your Pop Shop at 292 Lafayette St. What was once art by Keith Haring became “K. Haring” merchandise. Your art was meaningless in its ubiquity. You were emblazoned on T-shirts everywhere. You summed up New York cool. You were a skateboard and you were a child’s chair and you were a refrigerator magnet. This is what you wanted for your art: for the Radiant Baby to spread its innocent energy everywhere. You wanted your art, in all its baby-ness, to serve a variety of agendas, and commodifying it was a way to get that job done.
My baby Keith, in serving all of these agendas, your life — with all its pain and all its panic and all its purple — got lost. We find you today not in your Pop Shop, but on a rack in Urban Outfitters. We find you ironed on Egyptian Cotton, a somehow kitschier version of the kitsch from your Pop Shop. We buy you and absorb you, but we absorb the you that was assets, not the you that was flesh. Clad in cotton, we feel cool in our nostalgia for 1989 and don’t think about the purple that took you and the people who stood by as that purple took you. We don’t think about what 1989 might have looked like had we been there — how we ourselves might have been in pain, might have been panicked, might have wound up another purple baby in the ground.
My baby Keith, one night you were in bed reading “​Cities on a Hill.”​ In the book, there’s a man who inspects himself every day in the mirror, looking for purple. You got out of bed, walked towards the mirror, and looked for purple. There it was, on your leg. The next day, you went to the doctor, and you got the diagnosis. You walked to the East River. You cried and you cried and you cried.
My baby Keith, you began taking the drug. One week, your tooth started hurting so you went to the dentist. He saw the purple plum spot on the roof of your mouth. He asked you what it was, and you told him. He was wearing a mask and gloves, but he stopped examining you anyway. You had a cavity but were forced to leave the dental office. A few months later, the cavity got so bad you opened a phone book and called every dentist in New York, trying to find one who would touch you and your purple. By the time you did, you had to get a root canal. To manage your purple, you watched your diet and you slept nine hours every day. You tried to avoid stress — if that’s something one can avoid when life is purple.
My baby Keith, in 1989, you saw the Aids Coalition to Unleash Power’s 1987 “​Silence = Death”​ poster and created a painting by the same name. ACT UP’s poster was black with a tiny pink triangle in the center: an inverted concentration camp badge. ACT UP’s poster is panicked. There’s a choked silence in the words, “Silence = Death,” at the bottom of the poster, the sea of black closing in on the unassuming sliver of pink. You took this image and superimposed your signature jellybean-like figures. The panic of purple found in the poster — that choked silence — was lost in your rendition, Keith. The tension which was so tightly packed into the condensed font of the poster is nowhere to be found in the fluidity of your figures. The 1987 poster incites anger; your riff pacifies it.
My baby Keith, you weren’t trying to pacify purple — you were trying to purify it. That’s what babies do. Your art about purple tried to get the message across the way you had always gotten the message across: with purity, without judgment, with a simple and singular clarity, with a hope that humans can be made perfect, with a love that is blind. You drew jellybean babies dancing, even while purple babies were dying. You drew fluid lines with radiant energy, even while, out in the world, purple seemed to be a big fat eraser rubbing out all that energy.
My baby Keith, purple changed New York City and it changed your friends and it changed your body. But it changed nothing about your art.
My baby Keith, I wish it had. I wish you had made art about purple that was purple and not yellow. I wish you had tried to explain purple by being honest and not by trying to purify purple or make purple palatable. Your art drained purple of all its pain and panic so that viewers could ingest it like static on a television screen. They didn’t have to feel guilty that bodies were being shoved into trash bags. They didn’t have to think about dentists who refused to touch you, about walks along the East River, about the time you cried and you cried and you cried. What did it feel like to be left for dead, Keith? Your artwork leaves me no answer.
My baby Keith, maybe you would have grown up one day, maybe you wouldn’t always have been hanging onto life by the teat. Maybe you would have realized that love can’t be indiscriminate, nonjudgmental, blind — that purple babies need more love than people whose life is only connected to purple by a poster they see on the subway ride to work. But you didn’t get the chance to realize any of this because purple kills, because it infantilizes. It makes you helpless, makes you wail, makes you whither away so much that, even though you’re six feet tall, you weigh no more than a baby.
My baby Keith, in December of 1989, you walked into your studio and immediately had to lie down. You were trying all different kinds of pills in 1989, Keith. Some helped and others didn’t. When you tried to talk, all that came out was a scratching and screeching. Your mom came to stay with you in your apartment, but you didn’t know who she was. My baby Keith, you died at 4:40 a.m. on Friday, Feb. 16, 1990. A few days later, your big eyes, loose little curls, and the purple of your once smooth skin were charred and strewn across a field. In the summertime, it’s a cornfield. In February, it’s completely bare except for some hay.

Each time I return home from school, I take the 24 Divisadero to visit my high school friends.
The 24 bus slices all the way through San Francisco, from the north to the south and back again. I like to ride it because I can see the whole city; it’s whiter than I remember. Recently, it’s become harder to recognize the shops that I pass or the people that sit next to me.
I get on near my high school, at the top of the Pacific Heights District in the north. It’s just the bus driver and me. We descend down the hill, passing glowing mothers and smiling babies and nannies driving kids from private kindergarten to karate lessons. These people who live at the top, wealthy and immaculate, wouldn’t be caught dead on the 24.
If you ride the bus every day, you might not notice how much the city is changing; but it’s apparent to me, each time I come back from college, that things are different. There are more houses with regal columns and streets with plenty of parking. The people are different too. It’s almost as if older people have gotten younger. Dispensaries and ramen places have turned into lingerie boutiques and salad shops.
During the first ten minutes of my ride out of Pacific Heights, not a single passenger gets on. Then we stop at the intersection of Geary Boulevard, one of the longest streets in San Francisco. It also happens to lie at the bottom of the hill. The bus fills.
The new passengers, many coming from work, seem tired and frantic. The air is sweet with alcohol and sweat and stress. The bus driver yells at a homeless woman who is trying to board with her shopping cart of belongings. Someone is talking to themself. Another person lights a joint.
For ten blocks, no one gets on or off the bus. We’re going back up the hill again, and after we ascend about halfway, I realize that the bars and tattoo parlors I used to recognize are now rustic coffee shops with single-origin espresso and outdoor seating. Public schools are now private. I am the first one to get off. As I step down the stairs, I watch the bus climb towards the huge houses on top of the hill.
Talking about my city makes me uncomfortable.
Whenever I try, I think of the 24 Divisadero. I think about how many square feet of picturesque houses and Victorian mansions go by until a homeless person is barred from boarding the bus. If I think hard enough, I can see the homeless woman with her shopping cart disappear around a corner as the bus moves on to another swath of expensive lifestyles.
When I say I’m from San Francisco, people are mostly enthusiastic. They comment on the beautiful parks and the fog that I cherished as a child. The city is modern and happy and free. But it’s also expensive and divided. I get frustrated when I describe it. Do I tell them that I can’t see downtown from my house? Do I tell them that a salad is $15 or that a coffee is $5? Do I tell them that the outside walls of the Twitter building in the financial district are lined with homeless people?
The city is a contradiction. The illusion of innovation and good vibes is a veil that shrouds its drastic inequality.
And now, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that veil has been violently pulled away.
*****
Despite calling San Francisco home for 15 years, I didn’t realize how neglected these wealth disparities were — until a shelter-in-place was ordered to halt the spread of COVID-19. Now, the city has no choice but to address these disparities, brought into stark relief by the struggles of its homeless population. But it still feels like San Francisco is only owning up to them only out of necessity.
“From the beginning, [our homeless population] was an area of concern,” said Dr. Grant Colfax, the head of the city’s Department of Public Health, in an April 10 press conference. “From the beginning of our response, [they were] a prioritized population.”
When I read this, I can’t help but wonder what Colfax means by “prioritized population.” Has San Francisco finally decided to address its well-known “homelessness issue?” Or is it more concerned that homeless people might contribute to the spread of the disease?
In a frenzy to de-densify homeless shelters, the city discussed multiple options. Leasing hotel rooms and filling convention centers with new beds were both floated as suggestions, but little action has actually been taken.
On April 6, two homeless people tested positive for the coronavirus. Five days later, there were 70 new cases in the city’s largest homeless shelter.
To further de-densify, the city talked about moving the homeless into city parks and monuments like the Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District.
It’s weird to think about the Marina District now; most of my friends from high school who lived in the neighborhood have since moved away. They’ve been replaced by wealthy tech guys fresh out of business school. The Marina has become known as the frattiest and whitest part of the city.
The Palace of Fine Arts is the pride of the Marina, a monumental parody of a roman bath. When the city suggested repurposing The Palace as a refuge for the homeless, residents of the Marina were enraged. “No one wants this shelter in their neighborhood,” one resident commented in an online forum.
Is this really the San Francisco I fell in love with growing up?
With all of the news surrounding COVID-19, I hardly realized that some residents were actively opposing the temporary housing of the homeless and fuming because the shelter might encroach on their Starbucks Reserve and beloved upscale deli market. Wasn’t everyone supposed to stay inside anyway?
The city eventually dissolved the option to use The Palace.
Now, the government is racing to lease hotel rooms to isolate individuals at risk. In a city-wide press conference, Trent Rhorer, the executive director of the San Francisco Human Services Agency, claimed that the Mayor’s Office reached out to hotel owners throughout the city in hopes of securing rooms for the homeless; more than 45 hotels agreed to provide upwards of 10,000 rooms.
But I wonder how many people have actually moved.
The construction of new buildings like the Salesforce Tower, thought of by many as a symbol of the rapid changes the city has undergone in recent years, has obscured the reality of the nearly 17 percent spike in homelessness between 2017 and 2019 alone. The city’s historic skyline changes, and we make empty comments expressing concern for its homeless population. It’s ironic that only now that we are instructed to stay inside are we actually witnessing the reality of the San Francisco homelessness epidemic.
I can’t help but think about the future: What will become of the 7,000 hotel rooms currently occupied by individuals who won’t be able to afford their rent once the virus is contained?
And when I look out of the back window of the 24 Divisadero six months from now, what will I see?

In the past few weeks, I have clocked an unseemly number of hours scrolling through TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter. I have seen it all: the freshly baked bread, the baby photos, the pushup challenges, the reposted vegetable drawings. The first night I returned home, I stayed up all night, lying on my childhood bed and numbly refreshing Instagram. In the midst of my disorientation, I stumbled upon a new post from Gabi Abrão, the artist and influencer behind the Instagram account @sighswoon.
She posted a swipe-through guide on “passing the time during the pandemic,” offering advice ranging from guided meditation to getting “free trials of everything you’ve ever wanted to try out.” The first guide she posted last year, “how to have a positive experience on Instagram,” garnered over 85,000 likes and almost 800 comments. With over 100,000 followers on her account, her guides are archetypes of the kind of content she produces: self-help meets social theory meets art school meets magic.
“Specific to the pandemic guide, it’s accessible in the sense that every single thing on there is free and requires either household items or nothing at all but your body,” Abrão says in an email. “I chose to share exercises that I take part in and enjoy that have cleansing and creative undertones, and offered specific directions on how to approach them.” She continues, “Instead of saying, ‘watch movies,’ I recommended creating a watch list from the favorites of your friends and romantic interests for greater connection and conversation points.”
Central to the philosophy of @sighswoon is the exploration of an existence on the Internet; the popularity of the account solidifies and deepens this existence. Abrão undoubtedly fits influencer criteria — she partners with clothing brands and charges for exclusive content on Patreon — and yet, as Nicola Pardy writes in an article for The Outline, “@sighswoon’s content publicly grapples with pillars of its own existence within the influencer economy: interrogating the value of visibility, fixed traits, consistent aesthetics, monetizability.”
Abrão told me that in the past few weeks, she’s gained subscribers on Patreon at a faster rate than usual. Through a five-tiered monthly subscription program ranging from $3.99 (Sigh) to $222 (Swoon Supreme), subscribers get access to her close friends list on Instagram, weekly vlogs, and merchandise discounts. An article in The Atlantic last fall cited Abrão — among the likes of Caroline Calloway — for her use of subscription services, “charging money for all kinds of intimacy” by way of paid-for “personal email penpalship” and book recommendation lists.
Under quarantine and in self-isolation, people with careers inextricable from their social media followings are in a unique situation: an opportunity for increased exposure and economic gain at a moment when the idea of professional strategizing seems tone-deaf at best.
But Abrão also provides a specific service. She creates niche memes that act as a path toward self-actualization for her followers, a service that is now in higher demand.
“This is the first time on the internet that the entire world is on the exact same page, dealing with the exact same emotional and physical limitations. All content created and shared right now is in reaction to quarantine, even if it isn’t directly so,” Abrão writes. “By default, everything shared is art created from the quarantined self within the era of coronavirus. It is the one and only context.”
A few weeks ago, Abrão left the communal home she lives in with other artists to quarantine with her family in West Los Angeles. “I don’t have my own room here, there is no independent identity or privacy here, no desirable ‘aesthetic,’ and I am sharing a bed with my sister,” Abrão writes. Amid a world of influencers creating content from immaculate backdrops during their quarantines, Abrão’s situation might be more recognizable.
For many of us, the quietness of our current lives has emboldened our virtual selves. At the very least, we’re probably spending more time scrolling. Without the stability of unexpected social interactions, the influencer’s role becomes inflated. We’re living with our family and calling close friends every few days, but right now, the influencer might occupy a similar space as that of our more distant friends and acquaintances.
Recognizing what her followers originally sought out in @sighswoon seems to inform how Abrão has produced content in the past few weeks. “I decided at the very beginning of the pandemic that I wasn’t going to repost news stories, express doom, or discuss anything political or economic on my page,” Abrão writes. “I like the idea of people knowing that we can go to some ‘channels,’ [some profiles] for news and heavy realities, but also tune into others for consistent entertainment or general positivity when we need it.”
There is something comforting in the intentional reliability of accounts like @sighswoon — the height of a pandemic does not slow down her production of self-help-art-school memes. But this reliability feels disconcerting. Does the posturing of community on social media trick us into believing we live in a culture of collective care? Maybe accounts like @sighswoon are especially comforting because they are distant from the realities we operate in.
But despite her dedication to upholding the normalcy of her personal “channel,” Abrão believes in finding peace through experiences unique to today’s circumstances — quarantine, isolation, separation. “There is a whole network of people to connect within my phone at all times, and these days, that energy is 100 times stronger,” she says. “But there is also so much to be found in surrendering to the circumstances, allowing yourself to be quiet, to be invisible.”

I learned several valuable things about myself within the first month of college, all of which would have stunned my high school self into silence: First, I was not nearly as introverted as I had assumed. Second, I didn’t like science nearly as much as I had thought. And third, I really, really liked parties.
I have never been and likely never will be a “party girl” — a collegiate socialite with lots of appearances to make at places with lists and bouncers. Throughout my adolescence, I constructed my identity as a girl who read, and in my mind, she was the opposite of a girl who attended parties. However, after starting college I quickly learned that paralyzingly awkward, mind-numbing small talk became tolerable, even hilarious, when I was holding a red plastic cup as a prop — and that being “a girl who read” occasionally came in handy when small talk became an intellectual pissing contest.
My overwhelming need to make people laugh, which had buoyed me through high school, became indispensable when going to parties. As the night progressed, I would crack jokes at my own expense and tell stories about myself as though I were absent from the room. In this case, I could blame the alcohol or atmosphere, or let the Solo cup fill any awkward silences. Such well-intentioned posturing was like wearing a wetsuit: I could enjoy myself without feeling entirely vulnerable; I could swim without catching cold.
I’ve found that parties abide by the same rule of self-consciousness as group fitness classes: everyone else is far too worried about themselves to actually care what you’re doing. People notice, but not enough for it to matter, so I dance and flirt and attempt to sound cool and standoffish and fail miserably and greet someone too enthusiastically and yell and most of the time, whatever I say or do will be forgiven or forgotten the next morning. At parties, I’m playing dress-up as a version of myself — same sense of humor, same ability to name-drop New Yorker staff writers, same willingness to embarrass myself, but freed by the dynamics of the room and the plausible deniability of the fact that anything I say is just something I said at a party.
Best of all, I can watch everyone doing exactly the same thing, and revel in the sheer force of dozens of college students doing their best to look like they’re having fun, while still having a little fun in spite of themselves.
As one might hope, the shape of the college parties I attended changed as I got older. The dorm rooms became marginally larger, and the spaces grew more familiar. I stopped crashing people’s birthday parties (though in my defense, that only happened once). Alcohol became easier to procure, and we drank it less furtively. And the sweaty, densely packed dorm rooms and basements lost some luster; I became a little washed-up, a little tired, a little sick of elbowing people while dancing.
A college party is only a college party, at the end of the day. But amidst the sweat and the plastic bottles of alcohol there is joyful coincidence: a perfect song I’d forgotten I knew every word to, a yelled conversation about unfinished homework with that kid from my poetry seminar, a shrill and warm-hearted greeting from the girl I kind of know and only ever see in places like this. By senior year, I know who I want to see on a Friday night, and I hardly have to leave my building to do so — going out means entering a universe only slightly parallel to daily life, where party norms play out on a smaller scale and the “most fun versions of ourselves” are nearly identical to our actual selves.
Hosting a party, however, offers all this and a bonus: control. I curate the playlist; I bartend, and thus see everyone in attendance; and best of all, I have the ever-present excuse of Having To Go Deal With Something, whether that something is pouring shots of tequila or saving a friend from a terrible conversation. The practicalities of my party-dominion are less important than the fact that hosting is the best social crutch of all, offering me a sense of control over ultimately uncontrollable social interactions.
I hadn’t realized how much value I place on hosting parties until last year, when I caught wind of the fact that my then-boyfriend intended to throw me a surprise birthday party. I talked him down to a celebratory dinner with the “I’m really not a big birthday person” line, but on a visceral level, I did not want someone else throwing me a birthday party. The beauty of any mediocre college party is that I’m anonymous, just one of many people trying to have fun in a similar way. If I am to be the ostensible focal point of a party, I must be in control of the party. Otherwise, I’m exposed — no wetsuit, no bar to tend, and no conveniently timed situations to deal with.
***
A little under a year later, I submitted my senior thesis on a startlingly sunny Monday in March, drank champagne in the English department building, and resolutely tried to convince my friends to stop talking about coronavirus. This proved futile and exhausting, so I eventually decamped to eat cake in bed before collapsing into sleep. My roommate later joked that Monday was like the last nice day you spend with your aging dog before putting it to sleep: I got all my favorite treats, saw all my favorite people, and even had a romp around the Yard.
The following morning, Harvard students received notification that we would have to leave campus due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I had woken up, checked my phone, burst into tears, and started my period all before I could even hug my roommates.
My friends and I began drinking around noon, if not earlier. It was almost comforting to see other groups of students at the bar drinking their lunch: They also had no idea what to do, but they sure as hell weren’t going to class. There were not yet any confirmed cases of the virus on campus, and it seemed as though many students, myself included, had skimmed the announcement email in shock without absorbing its weight. As evidenced by that day, the gut instinct of many college students, when confronted with shocking upheaval, is binge drinking. This is a bad idea in normal circumstances, and surely a worse plan amidst a pandemic, but it was the only course of action that made any sense. It felt strange and hollow to go to class, and sitting at home crying with my friends seemed bleak. Famously, alcohol numbs emotions, and I was crushingly sad. I didn’t necessarily want to go to a party, but I wanted to embrace the fact that I was a Harvard student with only five days left on campus in the least depressing, most mindless way possible: hence, day drinking.
The kind of drinking that happened on Tuesday was, to my understanding, what happens during Senior Week. Normally, though, that drinking is spread out over an entire week (a month, even!), and the whole ordeal is less haunted by the specter of death. I was bewildered whenever I saw anyone dressed as though they were attending a party — a normal, springtime party, in celebration of something normal and inconsequential. Around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, I began sobbing on a rooftop bar, behind oversized sunglasses I had worn in anticipation of this scenario. I didn’t need a drink in my hand to feel comfortable; I needed people to look away while I cried, and maybe tissues. At that point, I realized that this was not a blowout bash, but rather the start of bizarre funerary rites for my college career.
The parties that happened in those last five days were like corrupted versions of normal college parties. They were necessarily more debaucherous than usual, but more than that, the regular components of a party now felt discordant. The people, locations, and drinks were all the same. But as partying mutated into a four-day-long hangover, there was no distinction between a party and daily life. People spoke bluntly in a mimicry of normal, tipsy party behavior, but now they did so because nothing seemed to matter. If a conversation turned awkward or if flirtation was poorly received, there was no need to blame it on the alcohol or the atmosphere — no one would see each other for months, or maybe ever again.
By Friday, we had stopped drinking ourselves into the ground. Our hangovers subsided but anxious aches and nausea remained, making any attempts at revelry unappealing. For the first twelve hours following the announcement, I had tried to forget the fact that we were vacating campus due to a pandemic — the fact that I had to leave campus at all felt like too much to comprehend. Social distancing was still an unfamiliar phrase, at least for a day or two. But news developed quickly, and we sobered quickly. By Wednesday evening, the prospect of a massive party felt more frightening than fun, though people still went out. By Thursday, we were worrying about infecting our families. Still, my closest friends and I hung on to each other like puppies, assuming that if one of us had been infected, we were all already infected. Our logic may have been flawed and was surely selfish, but I couldn’t imagine not clinging to them, tight grips on each other’s hands and shoulders like we were leading each other across a crowded dance floor.
Early on, my roommates and I had decided to throw a party on Thursday to blow through our excess alcohol, but that plan was quickly forgotten. Instead, on Thursday I brought an offering to my sophomore friend’s room: two just-opened bottles of liquor. My underclassmen friends, while resoundingly sad, were largely partying through the end with the knowledge that they would return to campus — to normalcy. I planned to move across the ocean in six months. If these were going to be my last moments of college, it seemed like I should try to remember them.
In the chaos of the week, I had almost forgotten that my 22nd birthday was on Saturday. Before the world exploded, I had clearly envisioned the birthday party I would throw after spring break. I would use my newfound free time to buy snacks and drinks and maybe bake a cake, curate a playlist, and convince all the people I liked most on campus to dance and gossip and drink with me for a few hours. In this alternate, normal universe, I would assuredly celebrate my actual birthday with friends before we all left for our respective spring breaks. In this actual universe, I was vacating my dorm instead of leaving for break on Saturday, but dinner at a bar on my birthday-eve was still feasible.
If I were to rank my birthday parties by the level of control I had over the situation, my 22nd would not be at the bottom of the list, surprisingly. I played at normalcy: the usual group of people, the usual bar, the usual drinks. The sense of control I relish at parties, though, requires predictability and established social norms. Any comforting predictability had dissolved over the past four days, even at a dinner of friends — a party only by the loosest definitions.
No one could focus on one conversation, much less the four simultaneous conversations that normally criss-crossed our table. I hardly touched my food, and the optimistic two pitchers of beer punch we’d ordered now seemed foolish. At one point, “Free Fallin’” by Tom Petty began to play. I was reminded of my mom (who is alive, just very kind) and Tom Petty (dead and beloved by my mom) and also, probably, of the fact that I had felt as though I was “free fallin’” for four days straight and I burst into tears. I can’t remember how my friends reacted, but I can only assume they felt similarly in the moment.
I hadn’t stopped going to parties that week because they were no longer fun, though that was true. I had gone, in the first place, to surround myself with people while it felt like Harvard was dissolving around me. I quickly realized which people I actually wanted to see, and I knew where to find them. While the idea of a party had lost all meaning, I still went with my friends to the bar for my birthday — an attempt at normalcy, maybe a desire to drink, but mostly, I just wanted to be around people. It didn’t matter where we were anymore.
I decided, somewhere between Tom Petty and the dregs of my drink, that all I wanted for my birthday was for the ten of us to scream in the middle of the Quad Lawn. The weather had progressively gotten colder that week, so I was shivering on the brief walk back but grateful to feel my body. We arranged ourselves in a close circle, leaving a small gap between each person. I felt twitchy and tense. Someone must have counted to three, and we screamed: ugly, horror movie shrieks and guttural cries of frustration mutating into almost-joyous release. Later, my roommate mentioned that she had felt panicky and weird all throughout dinner. “It was either the fresh air or the scream, but I feel better,” she said. In the moment after the scream, I felt the best I had felt in days.

As the world settled into the largest shutdown in modern history, a strange side effect emerged: The skies began to clear.
“One of the results of the shutdown has been a great improvement in air quality. And anybody can see this with regard to visibility,” explains Dr. Daniel Jacob, professor of Atmospheric Chemistry and Environmental Engineering at Harvard. Satellites and measurement stations, he says, have observed large drops in nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter pollution across the world.
And indeed, the skies have cleared — many in the Indian state of Punjab now report that they can see the Himalayas, over 100 miles away, for the first time in decades. As factories close, highways empty, and billions remain trapped at home, emissions have dropped sharply. One estimate from Carbon Brief shows a 25 percent reduction in carbon emissions compared to the same period last year, though Jacob notes that recent measurements show China is already returning to higher levels of pollution “As soon as the economy recovers, it will be back to normal with regards to air pollution.,” he says. “I have no doubt about this.”
These reductions in air pollution, for as long as they last, may reveal large-scale benefits to breathing cleaner air. “You can also do some calculations about the impact of mortality associated with air pollution, and you find considerable gains in that regard,” Jacob explains. And already, some have made these calculations — one conservative model from Dr. Marshall Burke, an assistant professor at Stanford, projects a two-month reduction in mortality of over 50,000 deaths in China alone.
However, Burke clarifies in the analysis that these don’t support any idea that pandemics are good for health, but instead merely represent one specific metric: the health benefits from the changes in air pollution caused by economic shutdowns.
When you zoom out, the interaction between the coronavirus pandemic and climate change is complicated and often reveals a dismal picture. New evidence suggests long-term exposure to air pollution may have made the disease more lethal, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities, while fossil fuel companies have attempted to leverage this moment to their advantage.
Previous research has already demonstrated that long-term air pollution exposure increases mortality risk, and now COVID-19 is proving to be an immediate example of its deadly effects. A recent study from the T.H. Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from approximately 3,000 counties in the United States and found that a rise in fine particulate matter of merely one microgram per cubic meter was associated with a 15 percent increase in the mortality rate of COVID-19.
These results, though still preliminary, are immediately relevant to environmental regulations and epidemic modeling, but many questions remain unanswered. The continued assessment of new data and potential additional confounding variables, as well as analysis at smaller spatial densities, all needed to confirm these results. The data and methods from the study have been made publically available under an open science framework, so students or other interested individuals can access and analyze the data themselves, and so other countries can replicate similar analyses.
For years, researchers have warned us that climate change exacerbates existing inequalities. Now, through a bleak display of transitive logic, the coronavirus pandemic is doing the same.
Dr. Francesca Dominici, professor of Biostatistics, Population, and Data Science at the Chan School, pointed out early reports which have shown a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths among people of color — in Louisiana, for instance, black people account for 70 percent of coronavirus fatalities yet make up only 32 percent of the population. In Wisconsin, the same is true: Black people represent 42 percent of the deaths from coronavirus and only 6 percent of the population.
Dr. Aaron Bernstein, director of the Center for Climate, Health, and Global Environment at the Chan School, notes that while research hasn’t yet shown air pollution to be a driving force behind these inequities in mortality, it is possible. Exploring this connection will require further research, but as Bernstein points out, “we already had ample reason to continue to improve air pollution, which we know aside from COVID-19, harms the poor and people of color in this country more than everybody else.”
To battle the virus, we’ve seen multi-trillion-dollar expenditures, daily white house press briefings, and massive sacrifices made by every individual. In response to climate change, progress has been slow and insufficient.
But the two crises aren’t so far apart — our response to both COVID-19 and climate change will determine whether people get sick or not and whether they live or not. This pandemic may even carry lessons regarding what it takes to mobilize defensive action. As Bernstein explains, “We can prevent harm by changing what we do when it comes to fossil fuels and how we provide energy to our lives, in a way that is in parallel to what is going on with COVID-19 and to make it much more personal and much more actionable.”
But fossil fuel companies, some claim, are attempting to seize the moment to sway public opinion and lobby for environmental protection rollbacks. Dr. Geoffrey Supran, research fellow in the Department of the History of Science, writes in an emailed statement, “The fossil fuel industry and its political allies are systematically exploiting coronavirus chaos to protect its profits and lock society into climate chaos.” He explains that as the coronavirus situation has worsened, there’s been an uptick in industry messaging as well as political lobbying from the fossil fuel industry. “What we’re seeing now are the familiar one-two punch public affairs tactics that Big Oil has perfected over the past century.”
TC Energy, the company building the Keystone Pipeline, has insisted on proceeding with the project in the midst of the crisis, claiming it will “strengthen the continent’s energy security,” while Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org, an environmental advocacy group, suggests in the New Yorker, “that’s obvious nonsense — at the moment, a record glut of oil is so overwhelming the market that there’s literally no place left to store it.” Meanwhile, Amy Westervelt, a reporter at Drilled News, claims to have tracked more than three dozen ways the fossil fuel industry and its allies in the Trump administration may have exploited the pandemic to roll back federal, state, and local regulations.
Supran suggests out Harvard may not be a neutral player in this game: “As students and faculty have been pointing out for seven years, by continuing to refuse to divest from fossil fuels, Harvard is legitimizing the politics of Big Oil… The fossil fuel industry’s lobbying and propaganda campaigns to delay climate action and exploit the coronavirus crisis are, in Harvard’s eyes, legitimate tactics worthy of our investments.” Jason Newton, a spokesperson for Harvard, declined to comment on these claims.
In response to a recent NY Times op-ed in which the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and Stanford defended their decision to “tak[e] difficult steps now, for the public good,” Supran writes that institutions like Harvard have “been ahead of the curve in confronting this crisis. If only they could bring the same logic and leadership to our collapsing climate too.”

These days, Carlos A. Torres, a fourth-year at Harvard Medical School, feels like a “sitting duck.”
“We’re not doing much work, but if given the opportunity, we could help out,” he says, exasperated.
Last week, Torres finished the final lecture component of his medical school education from his home. He stands on the cusp of graduating from medical school and beginning his residency. But after the HMS administration announced that all clinical rotations were to be put on pause on March 14, it appeared as if he would never have the opportunity to complete the clinical component of his Capstone Rotation, described by the Medical School’s course catalog as “a culminating clinical experience for all fourth-year medical students.”
He fills his newfound freetime at home with Netflix and recently baked banana bread. It had been on his to-do list for a while.
As COVID-19 has spread across the country, many hospitals have struggled to keep up with an influx of new patients. In hopes of alleviating the pressure on the medical system, many state governors have called on medical school deans to allow their fourth-year students to graduate early so that they can begin their residencies immediately.
Though Harvard Medical School now offers this option, bureaucratic barriers have prevented many eligible students from answering the call. As a result, Torres isn’t the only student to feel as if they have been left in limbo, neither able to continue their medical education online nor start their residency programs until the summer.
As of now, his residency in general medicine at a hospital in Portland, Ore. has yet to call him to start early. His scheduled start date is June 15.
Kirstin W. Scott, another fourth-year student, was heading into a rotation in the Boston Children Hospital’s Emergency Department when she learned that all clinical rotations had been suspended.
Following the announcement, Scott and two other HMS students, Derek R. Soled and Shivangi Goel, decided to take matters into their own hands. By 10 a.m. the next morning, they had formed the HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team.
“I think this frustration, more than frustration, the sadness that many students are currently facing is because they just want to help in whatever capacity they can,” Goel says. “It feels like [we are] in this really dire time when people are really sick and our health system is so overburdened, but individuals who have the capability to help aren’t able to be deployed yet.”
The HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team offers a way for students to collaborate with the HMS administration and find more avenues to get involved. Scott says the team polled their classmates to understand the extent to which “they’re feeling moved to respond.” After speaking with their fellow HMS students “the team identified four areas of need in which medical students could take an active role,” Soled says.
Those four areas became the broad structure for the team’s four core board committees. One would focus on disseminating information to medical professionals. Another would prepare information for the community. The final two boards would focus on community activism: one by providing “non-clinical” support to healthcare providers, and the other by helping match medical students with opportunities to assist in caring for patients.
The team sent out a survey to HMS students asking who would be willing to volunteer in a clinical setting, with, Goel says, the goal of “relieving the burden on the healthcare workforce at this time.” As of today, more than 420 HMS students have responded.
“It just goes to show that even when it's a completely voluntary effort, when it’s a very dangerous situation out there, there’s not always PPE [personal protective equipment], that our students are really committed to helping in whatever way they can,” Goel says.
Though many HMS students are unable to graduate early and begin their residencies, the HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team has been coordinating with academic hospitals to find opportunities for medical school students to put their medical expertise to use in a hands-on way.
But despite this enthusiasm, as of last week, only about 80 HMS students were volunteering in a clinical setting through the Response Team, Goel says. Credentialing and licensing requirements mean that medical school students can only volunteer to practice medicine in hospitals where they are provisionally licensed as medical school students. She expects the number of volunteers will be closer to 150 or 200 students by the end of this week.
Although many students are eager to start, it is ultimately up to each hospital and residency program if they will ask their incoming residents to graduate early and begin working. Josie T. C. Fisher, a fourth-year HMS student, says she would start her residency program in Internal Medicine and Primary Care at Massachusetts General Hospital early “in a heartbeat” if she were asked; as of now, she has not. “Those are our future colleagues,” she says, working hard and in “risky situations.”
Fisher does add that if her program does not truly need her, she does not want to start early and add to the hospital administration’s workload, because the “burden of getting us credentialed is really high.”
As he was finishing his final days of medical school via Zoom, Torres volunteered to help educate the general public last week through HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team’s Instagram: @futuremdvscovid. He, along with others, created infographics to answer the public’s questions and found memes that were “funny, but also, kind of serious and grab[bed] people's attention,” he says.
“Everyone is a COVID patient,” Scott says. She explains that patients with health issues who have not been able to go to the hospital because of quarantine now face an increased risk. The HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team has been coordinating telemedicine opportunities to help treat standard clinic patients or primary care. “That is part of the COVID response, if you will — you don’t have to be interacting in an ICU,” Scott continues. “We all as a society are part of this response right now.”
Even as hundreds of students are eager to help on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19, the HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team has been attempting to remain mindful of issues and communities that “could potentially be neglected,” as the nation hones in on the immediate impact of the virus. They’ve focused their attention on Indigenous communities, the imprisoned population, and the homeless.
“We may not be using all of our medical knowledge and all of our medical training in any individual task, but at the end of the day, no task is too small,” Goel says. Medical students could be delivering groceries to the elderly or in the ICU. “We’re still helping an individual in the community who is affected by COVID,” Goel adds.
Despite his desire to volunteer in a hospital, Torres acknowledges that it could be dangerous. “We’ve heard horror stories of physicians who are not getting adequate protective equipment, so they’re not practicing in safe environments,” he says.
Fisher voiced similar concerns. She notes that whether or not she is seeing COVID-19 patients, the virus can linger on surfaces, so she worries about “bringing it home and exposing my husband.” She also notes that her parents, who live nearby, are in an age demographic that puts them at risk of “worse outcomes” should they contract the virus. Thus, she anticipates that she will have to avoid seeing them for an extended period of time after her residency program begins. “I recognize I won’t get to see [my parents] once I start,” she says. “It could be for quite some time that I don’t get to see them.”
Beyond the immediate risk of infection, Torres also worries about burnout. “The four to five weeks of vacation that you have in between the end of medical school and the start of internship, people like trying to live it to the fullest,” he says. Graduates often plan trips, parties, or weddings in that time between graduation and the beginning of their internship or residency program –– which often requires up to 80 hours of work per week.
Torres says he was invited to three of his classmates’ weddings that were supposed to take place during this time –– all three have been canceled.
One of the final lectures of his medical school education focused on the ethics of work-life-balance. “Where do you draw the line to take care of yourself and take care of other people?” Torres says, recalling its content. He mentions that a number of his classmates have been thinking “out loud” about that issue lately.
As fourth-year HMS students try to come to terms with their role in this pandemic, almost but not quite able to become first-responders, the uncertainty has provided time for reflection. The moment “requires humility,” Scott says. “We need to be patient and to try and set ourselves up to be ready when we are called upon.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07 has been appointed as the senior director of the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair announced in a Wednesday email to students.
Scarborough previously served as the director for the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, and was appointed as the interim director for the Harvard Foundation in August 2019. In his new capacity, he will work under the incoming Associate Dean of Students for Inclusion and Belonging Alta Mauro, who is set to begin her tenure May 1.
O’Dair praised Scarborough’s past work at the College in her email announcing the appointment.
“I have had the chance to work closely with Sheehan during my time as dean of students, and I have seen firsthand the energy, enthusiasm and commitment he brings to our students and to the Harvard community every single day,” O’Dair wrote. “I know he will bring that same passion to the Harvard Foundation.”
The mission of the Harvard Foundation — founded in 1981 — is to “highlight the strength of our diversity,” according to the email. Past Foundation programming has included the Humanitarian Awards, Cultural Rhythms, and support for the Student Advisory Council.
In addition to the director of BGLTQ Student Life and the interim director of the Harvard Foundation, Scarborough has served as the assistant director of Student Services and as a proctor in the Freshman Dean’s Office, O’Dair wrote.
“In these roles, he has been instrumental in helping to promote diversity, inclusiveness, and the intersection of the multiple identities of students across all facets of the College and creating a welcoming environment for all members of our community,” she wrote.
Scarborough said in a Wednesday interview he plans to spend this summer “integrating” the Harvard Foundation and the Office of Diversity Education and Support — a division of the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion.
“The first priority is identifying what this new structure is going to look like, and how do we ensure critical missions in both offices and the good work that they've been doing,” he said. “We get to capitalize on that and really raise the profile in a new, more effective organization.”
In Feb. 2019, the College announced that the Foundation would merge with the EDI Office after a re-evaluation of the Foundation’s role.
During his time with the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, Scarborough oversaw the office’s relocation to Grays Hall, and spearheaded the pilot program for gender-inclusive housing in freshman dorms. He also said serving as interim director for the Foundation informed him about the “real, immediate needs” for the Foundation.
“What I've learned in these roles is that you have to be present, you have to be visible, you have to be in communication with students, and you have to have a trusting relationship with them,” he said.
He also acknowledged the need to adapt to the remote nature of Dean of Students Office operations, and said he is focusing on how the office can connect to and support students virtually.
“We're going to need to be very creative in thinking about how to maintain networks of community,” he said. “How we do that virtually, remotely, that's the creative project for the next few months.”

Harvard’s Counseling and Mental Health Services has suspended its peer counseling services through the remainder of the spring term, according to CAMHS chief Barbara Lewis.
CAMHS supervises the College’s five peer counseling groups, many of which are specialized to cater to specific mental health concerns. The five groups offer support for students with concerns pertaining to body image, sexuality, gender, relationships, harassment, race, class, and general mental health.
Peer counseling groups normally work closely with CAMHS supervisors to ensure they are providing “appropriate” care to students on campus, Lewis wrote. The groups have suspended services because they cannot receive such supervision from afar.
“Our primary focus has been and continues to be that students seeking therapy have access to CAMHS services with minimal disruption, no matter where they are located,” Lewis wrote. “With that sentiment as our guiding principle in all that we do, we determined that temporary suspension of peer counseling is the most responsible course of action to maintain student safety.”
Students say the coronavirus pandemic has both exacerbated their preexisting mental health concerns, and generated new ones. Many cited social isolation, sick family members, lost jobs, and abusive households as compounding factors to their existing anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.
In response to the health crisis and undergraduate dispersal, the College reconfigured remote mental health resources offered through CAMHS. Harvard University Health Services emailed affiliates last month with information about its new online offerings, including teletherapy, video-based group therapy, and online resilience workshops.
CAMHS clinicians normally dedicate two hours a week to overseeing peer counseling groups during the semester. Lewis wrote, however, that clinicians can no longer properly fulfill this advising role while dedicating themselves to the training required for the rapid transition to telemedicine.
“I appreciate that students might wish to connect with peer counselors, but these are extraordinary times, and we remain focused on providing high quality telemedicine services to all students across the Harvard community,” she added.
Lewis encouraged students seeking mental health resources to visit CAMHS’s website. She added that students requiring help after CAMHS’s operating hours should call its emergency counseling hotline to speak with a licensed therapist.
Jennifer “Jenny” X. Hong ’23, who works as a peer counselor at Harvard Eating Concerns Hotline and Outreach, said the group has adapted operations since it cannot provide remote peer counseling services.
Hong said ECHO intends to launch social media campaigns to promote body positivity and answer student questions about mental health. ECHO has also begun soliciting applications for new peer counselors for the fall semester, as have other peer counseling groups — Contact, Indigo, Response, and Room 13. Contact, which focuses on serving Harvard’s BGLTQ community, also publicized a document outlining online resources over student email lists.
Hong said she hopes students will spend their time away from campus practicing self-care rather than feeling pressure to be productive.
“It's totally understandable to feel anxious and overwhelmed and taking care of yourself is the most important thing right now,” Hong said. “There are resources still available, even though ECHO is unfortunately unable to do what we do. CAMHS is still available, and there's lots of resources online. There is support out there.”

The Allston-based Houghton Chemical Corporation has partnered with hospitals to provide hand sanitizer due to increased demand as a result of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
The family-owned company manages a chemical plant in Allston to distribute and manufacture chemicals for various purposes. One chemical they manufacture is ethyl alcohol, also known as ethanol, a key ingredient for hand sanitizer.
Bruce E. Houghton, president of the company, said he hopes to use the plant’s ethanol production to provide free hand sanitizer to those in need.
“We formulate things for our own product line, which include ethyl alcohol,” he said. “We have discontinued the product line and made it available for hand sanitizers for free.”
Hand sanitizer has been in high demand for months due to the pandemic, with stores and hospitals alike experiencing shortages. Though many hospitals are in need of additional sanitizer, local residents have said stores have seemed fairly well stocked, with some exceptions.
Catherine M. Snedeker, an Allston resident, said her supermarket is “really pretty stocked,” but noted that other stores may be running short on certain products.
“There is still the people, like a lot of places, that wipe out the aisles — the paper product aisles,” Snedeker said.
Houghton said getting the hand sanitizer to those who need it has not been an easy process, however, due to hospital rules and Department of Transportation regulations.
“We're trying to work with the healthcare providers and providing them with hand sanitizers, but we're constantly running into roadblocks that make it extremely difficult to do so, relative to hospital regulations, DOT regulations, packaging regulations, and all else,” he said.
“I’m now trying to work with the Mass. emergency response people to deliver the products under their auspices, utilizing the National Guard,” he added.
Houghton said the complicated process has been “frustrating.”
“It's slow and awkward,” he said. “It's very frustrating to have the product here and available and unable to provide it.”
Houghton said that, despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, he is confident in his company’s endurance.
“We’re a strong and healthy corporation, which will survive this,” he said.

Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig dropped a lawsuit Monday that he had filed against the New York Times after the newspaper changed the headline and lede of a story about his views on the practice of accepting money from deceased sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.
Lessig filed a suit against the Times in January alleging that a Sept. 14 story it published last year under the headline “A Harvard Professor Doubles Down: If You Take Epstein’s Money, Do It in Secret” was “false and defamatory.”
The article was based on a September Medium post that Lessig wrote explaining his decision to sign a petition supporting his friend Joichi “Joi” Ito, who resigned as head of the MIT Media Lab and stepped down as a visiting professor at Harvard after the New Yorker reported he had attempted to conceal the lab’s financial ties to Epstein.
On April 2, the Times’ story was updated with an altered lede and a headline that matched its print title.
Lessig told The Crimson Wednesday that he did not reach a settlement with the Times. He said he decided to drop his suit soon after the changes to the story were made.
“I’m satisfied with what they’ve done,” Lessig said. “I think their current characterization is accurate. I hope that the understanding of the change can spread far enough to especially those people who had a misimpression because of the original story.”
An editors’ note added to the piece said that the previous version of the story “referred imprecisely” to Lessig’s views.
“The lead has been edited to reflect that while Mr. Lessig defended Joi Ito, who had accepted anonymous donations from Jeffrey Epstein, he said he would prefer that institutions not accept such money,” the editors’ note reads.
The story’s lede — which originally said Lessig “has been trying” to defend the practice of soliciting donations from Epstein — now reads, “It is hard to defend a university official who anonymously accepted donations from the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law professor, has been trying, even though he wishes universities had never taken the money.”
Lessig said he “was surprised how long it took” for the story to be changed. He added that he did not think the Times would have altered the piece had he not brought a lawsuit.
“I asked for them to make the change the very first day the story went up,” he said. “Had they made this change at that point, then a significant amount of hate and anger would not have been directed against me, and many people’s judgments would not have been affected the way they’ve been affected. There’s nothing I can do to really repair that.”
“I hope that the Times — or any publication that relies on online spreading of their stories through headlines that are designed to attract people in, we could call it clickbait — will think about better procedures for making sure that a similar thing doesn’t happen to others,” Lessig added.
In an emailed statement to The Crimson, New York Times spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said the newspaper was “disappointed” in Lessig’s decision to file a suit.
“The revisions we have now made to the lead of the story were proposed to Professor Lessig and his attorney in October,” she wrote. “We were disappointed that instead of responding, he chose to file a lawsuit. The story accurately captured Professor Lessig’s views (as he conceded after publication in an email to our reporter). The changes in the lead were designed to more fully summarize what the rest of the article accurately reported.”
“As we were about to file a motion to dismiss, Professor Lessig withdrew his suit, before a judge was able to assess the suit’s merits,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Social distancing measures such as school closures and stay-at-home orders adopted to combat the coronavirus pandemic may need to continue into 2022, a team of scientists led by Harvard School of Public Health professors Marc Lipsitch and Yonatan H. Grad wrote.
The researchers used information about the novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, as well as other human coronaviruses to formulate a five-year outlook of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, unveiling their findings in a report published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed journal Science.
Stephen M. Kissler, a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Public Health and an author on the paper, said the researchers outlined and modeled potential scenarios for the next few months based on current social distancing practices in place.
Kissler said the researchers wanted to investigate whether rates of infection would be effectively slowed by just one stint of social distancing.
“I think that there's sort of been this implicit understanding that we'll do one period of social distancing, that'll flatten the curve, and then we'll reach immunity in the population, and then we'll be done,” Kissler said.
Based on their models, however, the researchers found this assumption is likely not the case.
“Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded,” they wrote in the report. “To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022.”
Kissler said that, with each wave of social distancing, more people will develop immunity to the virus. As a result, the severity of interventions will be able to “let up a bit” while maintaining the same level of effectiveness.
As the report addresses, Kissler said the question of immunity remains the “key big unknown” about the virus.
Immunity from the coronaviruses that cause the common cold and milder illnesses is known to last only a year or two, while for more severe coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS, immunity after initial infection lasts three to five years, according to Kissler. For the novel coronavirus, he said researchers believe immunity will be “relatively short-lived."
“The question was whether it'll be long enough to sort of get us through this first pandemic wave and prevent another one from happening or not,” Kissler said.
The scientists warned in the report that, even with effective social distancing, the novel coronavirus could remain a threat for the next five years, depending on certain factors related to its immunity.
“Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024,” they wrote.
Kissler said the wide variety of social distancing techniques being used across the globe will soon provide scientists much more information to compare the effectiveness of different measures in reducing transmission — essentially supplying a number of “natural experiments."
“My hope is that over time, we'll be able to tailor these interventions, so that they're sort of in the sweet spot where they're minimally disruptive but sort of maximally reduce transmission,” Kissler said.
In future work, Kissler said he hopes the models from the report can be adapted to develop localized predictions using data from different parts of the United States and countries across the world, tailored to each area’s climate, rate of contact between people, and age distribution.
“Before critical care capacity gets exceeded and before we cross these critical prevalence thresholds, we can see that, and then we can start adjusting their behavior accordingly,” Kissler said.
Ultimately, he said he envisions the integration of these models into day-to-day life.
“We can start doing things almost like weather forecasting, but it’s like COVID forecasting,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two Harvard Ph.D. students, Ja Young Choi and Boram Lee, created a crowdsourced map to track instances of anti-Asian aggression amid the coronavirus pandemic last week.
The recent cases follow a trend of increased incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans across the country.
The webpage “Stop AAPI Hate” — a collaboration between the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Department of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University — reported receiving over 1,100 reports of verbal harassment, shunning, and physical assault against Asian Americans in the two weeks since the site’s launch on March 19.
The “COVID-19 Racial Aggression” map, powered by Google My Maps, enables users to input descriptions and locations of instances of anti-Asian discrimination across the country. As of Wednesday, the map had at least 100 entries and over 27,000 views.
The entries are split into three categories: verbal aggression, physical aggression, and vandalism. Around Harvard’s campus, there were verbal aggression incidents logged around Harvard Square, the Cambridge Common, the Science Center Plaza, and Massachusetts Avenue.
The form to add incidents onto the map included a link to resources compiled by the Department of East Asian Languages and Civilizations for students experiencing COVID-19-related harassment.
Lee, a Ph.D. candidate in government, said she was inspired to create this map after experiencing racial verbal aggression for the first time in her six years in Cambridge.
“In one case, just a random guy swore at me in front of the Science Center plaza. And the other case was I was going to get some groceries. Somebody just followed me and — it was not threatening physically at all — but she wanted to tell me ‘Chinese is no good’ or ‘China no good,’” Lee, who is of Korean descent, said. “It was striking that these things happened to me within a matter of two weeks.”
Choi, a Medical Sciences Ph.D. student and co-creator of the interactive map, said the map led to some surprising findings.
“We just noticed it was happening everywhere. It’s not confined to one area within the Boston area. It was happening in Watertown, Cambridge, Somerville,” she said. “And one of the questions we ask is whether people were wearing masks. It’s not like there’s a clear pattern — like if you’re wearing a mask you’re more likely to get racial aggression — that’s not the case.”
Originally, the pair circulated a Boston-specific map through word of mouth and Asian affinity groups at Greater Boston area universities, but then decided to expand the map to include New York City. The map now covers incidents across the United States and Canada.
Lee intends for the map to raise awareness rather than to serve as a comprehensive hate crime tracker.
“The main objective for us is to provide a platform where people can share information about incidents that they think may not measure up to a report-worthy hate crime,” Lee said, adding that even incidents of verbal aggression could prelude more grave hate crimes.
“Raising awareness itself is, I think, already an act of making a statement that this is not okay. And that it is valid for people to feel concerned and scared in these weird times,” Choi said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 24, 2020, 9:43 p.m.
Harvard has indefinitely suspended its search for faculty specializing in ethnic studies due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay wrote in an email to the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition, a student and alumni group demanding the University establish an ethnic studies program.
Gay wrote in the March 26 email that she made the “very difficult, and frankly heart-breaking, decision” to suspend the search after the search committee unanimously agreed that candidates would no longer be able to best present their work, and that Harvard affiliates would be less able to engage with them after the University’s transition to online classes and remote work.
“I can’t even begin to describe how disheartening it is to have seen this effort begin to bear its first fruits, only to have meaningful progress put on an indefinite timeline,” Gay wrote. “But we also know that the attention of faculty, both those advancing this work here and those who are candidates in this process, is necessarily dedicated elsewhere.”
Gay announced in June 2019 that she would hire three to four senior faculty who specialize in Asian American, Latinx, and Muslim studies by the end of the 2019-2020 academic year. Two candidates had already visited Harvard to give talks and meet with faculty and students, and nine more were scheduled to visit later in the spring semester, according to Gay’s letter.
Though she has not set a timeline for the resumption of the faculty search, Gay assured the coalition that the FAS is still continuing its work to advance ethnic studies at Harvard.
“Conversations among the faculty continue,” she wrote. “But the formal search process is not continuing at this time and it’s not clear, at this moment of profound uncertainty and instability, when this search will be restarted in earnest.”
HESC declined to comment on or provide a copy of the email.
Gay’s initial announcement of the faculty search came months after students and alumni protested the departure of two tenure-track faculty specializing in Asian American studies. The University’s November decision to deny tenure to Romance Languages and Literatures associate professor Lorgia García Peña — who studies race and ethnicity — reinvigorated calls for an ethnic studies concentration. Harvard affiliates have lobbied for a formalized ethnic studies program for nearly five decades.
Gay wrote she is personally disappointed by the suspension of the search. Upon taking office as FAS Dean in 2018, Gay said recruiting ethnic studies faculty would be a top priority during her tenure. In December 2019, she declared an “institutional commitment” to the field of ethnic studies and said she was “hopeful” the faculty search would kickstart an effort to develop an ethnic studies concentration.
“This effort has been one of my highest priorities as dean, an effort that advances work that I’ve been committed to throughout my career, made possible through an unprecedented level of investment from FAS,” she wrote.
The timeline for hiring those faculty is now unclear. University President Lawrence S. Bacow announced an immediate University-wide salary and hiring freeze, among other budget cuts, Monday. Gay followed by announcing FAS-specific budget cuts, including the suspension of nearly all faculty searches, on Wednesday.
Gay wrote in her letter to the coalition that Harvard’s ethnic studies job candidates may face a higher burden than other faculty at their current universities to sustain a sense of community during the pandemic.
“Out of respect for the candidates and the process, we had no choice but to suspend until the people and process have the time and attention they need and deserve,” Gay wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After Harvard officials announced University-wide hiring and salary freezes Monday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences indefinitely placed faculty searches and capital projects on hold, FAS Dean Claudine Gay announced in a Wednesday email to faculty and staff.
Gay announced Friday that the FAS is unable to cover its budget for the 2020 fiscal year after netting $30 million in losses due to campus de-densification measures the University implemented in response to the coronavirus outbreak.
In her Wednesday email, Gay wrote that the pandemic has impacted FAS’s financials in many more ways than the direct costs of de-densification.
“The pandemic and the resulting economic downturn have disrupted Extension School programs, sponsored research funding, philanthropy, the endowment, and other important sources of support for our mission-driven activities, with no sign of a return to normalcy in the foreseeable future,” she wrote.
FAS will suspend all faculty searches except for a “small number” already near completion, Gay wrote. In late March, she suspended the FAS’s high-profile search for faculty specializing in ethnic studies due to the pandemic.
In addition to adhering to the University-wide freeze on salary increases, Gay announced FAS will suspend all bonus programs. She wrote that lecturers and preceptors will be exempt from the University’s policy and will receive a salary increase announced earlier this semester.
FAS will also ask its managers to keep vacant positions open and to “better leverage” existing staff, potentially requiring some staff to take on new tasks. Gay wrote she hopes these changes will allow FAS to avoid layoffs or reductions in compensation for its current employees.
“With this approach we hope to sustain, for as long as possible, employment and benefits for our current workforce,” she wrote.
She also asked managers to cut non-essential spending.
“We expect all units to make every effort to identify savings that can be achieved by delaying, reducing, or canceling activities and programs that are not mission-critical,” Gay wrote.
FAS last took such stringent belt-tightening measures in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. That December, it announced freezes on faculty searches and salary raises and asked departments to cut 10 to 15 percent of their budgets.
Gay also announced she has suspended all FAS capital projects, citing Boston and Cambridge ordinances. The cities each shut down construction projects in March to combat the virus.
“The many capital projects that were underway, planned, or envisioned in the FAS will be evaluated as to whether and when they will resume, based on priority level and funding source,” she wrote.
The University is reviewing all its other capital projects to determine which it should defer. Harvard already delayed the opening of its new Science and Engineering Complex in Allston to spring 2021. It was slated to open in fall 2020 after five years of construction.
In her announcement Wednesday, Gay reiterated principles she outlined in her Friday email that will guide her decision-making on budget cuts: prioritizing health and safety, protecting the FAS's “academic enterprise,” leveraging breadth and diversity, and preserving access and affordability.
Wednesday’s “immediate-term actions” are meant to allow more flexibility to support academic priorities as longer-term financial planning continues, Gay wrote.
“More than ever before, we will need to draw on our collective wisdom, strength, and creativity to navigate this new trajectory and maintain the commitment to excellence that distinguishes us as an institution,” Gay wrote. “I invite your engagement and your ideas in the work ahead. I will be looking to you for help. Often.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In any normal election year, collecting the required number of signatures to get on a Massachusetts primary ballot would seem to be one of a candidate’s most mundane tasks.
But 2020 is anything but a conventional election year.
As candidates across the Bay State have ditched in-person campaigning due to the coronavirus crisis, office-seekers are scrambling in order to meet normally-unobtrusive signature requirements to get on the September primary ballot.
“Our efforts to gather signatures are proceeding full bore,” Republican United States Senate hopeful Kevin O’Connor said.
For many candidates who are still below their signature threshold, that means mailing out an inordinate number of nomination papers to supporters in their district — and dealing with a logistical nightmare once the documents are sent back.
Candidates must get their nomination papers certified first by the locality the voter signing it resides in, and then by the Secretary of State’s office.
“We’re getting petitions with one or two signatures. And we have to sort through those thousands upon thousands of petitions,” O’Connor said. “We have to sort them out for the right town [and] get them to the appropriate town clerks.”
To get on the primary ballot in a U.S. House race, candidates need 2,000 signatures from district residents. David F. Cavell — a former speechwriter for ex-President Barack Obama who is running in the Massachusetts Fourth Congressional District’s competitive Democratic primary — said that task is normally accomplished by staking out grocery stores and other high-density areas where volunteers and staff members get residents to sign papers.
“The signature-gathering process is a sort of little-known but critical element of the democratic process in Massachusetts,” Cavell said.
Amid the coronavirus crisis, Cavell said he has “had to completely revise” his signature-gathering strategy to focus on mailing nomination papers to supporters to sign. He added that he has set up tables outside some supporters’ homes that “allow people to come and sign at a safe distance” with their own pens.
Ihssane Leckey, one of Cavell’s Democratic primary opponents, described a similar tack. Leckey said she collected over 1,000 signatures before the coronavirus forced campaigns to move away from in-person organizing.
“It’s not perfect, but it’s a way,” she said of the new signature-gathering methods.
But the difficulties don’t stop there.
Melissa B. Smith, a candidate for State Representative in the Fourth Norfolk District, said she was hampered in her signature-gathering efforts before the coronavirus hit as she recovered from a respiratory illness. It takes just 150 signatures for state House hopefuls to get on the ballot, but Smith said she expects many papers to get disqualified due to benign mistakes that voters make while filling out the nomination papers.
“Even people who are very familiar with the process of signing nomination papers don’t always remember from campaign to campaign where exactly they’re supposed to sign or what exactly they’re supposed to write,” Smith said. “It’s a significant number that get disqualified in normal circumstances.”
“In these circumstances, with everything moving more slowly — with town halls staying closed, with it being a much more onerous process to even turn them in — it’s just a bigger barrier,” she added. “We need to collect significantly more signatures in order to ensure that we have the minimum required number. And even then, it’s likely that many of them will be rejected.”
Smith, O’Connor, and Democratic U.S. House candidate Robert Goldstein are suing the state to change the signature requirement. The Supreme Judicial Court is scheduled to begin hearing arguments on the case Thursday.
There are also several legislative efforts aimed at reducing signature requirements.
Democratic Senators Karen E. Spilka and Joan B. Lovely introduced a bill that would cut the number of signatures required for federal and county offices in half. Still, the proposed measure would not change the requirements for state House and Senate hopefuls.
Smith said the proposal does not go far enough.
“It’s a bad look, I think,” she said. “It looks like they’re trying to protect incumbents with this.”
Spilka defended the measure in an emailed statement.
“The bill on signatures, which the Senate released to the public on Friday evening, is the result of countless conversations over several weeks,” she wrote. “The bill reflects a general consensus view that offices that require 1,000 signatures or more should be reduced in light of the COVID-19 emergency. It is important to strike a balance between promoting access to the ballot and ensuring candidates demonstrate sufficient community support for their candidacies.”
Some candidates — like Jordan Meehan, who is challenging State Representative Kevin G. Honan for the Democratic nomination in the 17th Suffolk District — have already gotten their signature requirements out of the way. Meehan said he received confirmation from the Secretary of State’s office Tuesday that his name would appear on the ballot.
“Because we were so organized so early, we got our signature requirement mostly hammered out around Super Tuesday,” he said.
U.S. Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III (D-Mass.) also announced Wednesday that he received confirmation from the Secretary of State that he will appear on the September primary ballot. Kennedy is challenging incumbent U.S. Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).
The Boston Globe reported last week that Markey was around 3,000 signatures shy of the requirement to get his name on the ballot. In an emailed statement to The Crimson, Markey’s campaign manager, John E. Walsh, said the campaign is “confident” it will reach the 10,000 signature threshold.
Jennifer Fries, a Democratic state House candidate who is running in the 24th Middlesex District, said that “in any normal year, this would be the lowest barrier” to meet.
In this election cycle, however, she said “it’s going to be down the wire.”

It’s been a few weeks since college closed, and while many things have undoubtedly changed, email correspondence certainly hasn’t. From having to ask professors about their new syllabus to sending check-in emails to club members, we are even more immersed in this digital mode of communication than ever before.
Do you feel like your COVID-19 email openers are getting overused and becoming stale? Is the “I hope you are well during these unusual times” line falling flat? Here are some tips on how to spice up your emails and deliver some quality openers!
“Hope you’re hanging in there… By the way, here’s an article on mask shortage controversies in the U.S. that I thought you might enjoy reading.” 
A great opener to your professors and mentors. Not only are you showing concern, as you should, but you are also passing on some interesting information that can matter a lot in the current climate. Who knows? Maybe they’ll learn something helpful for themselves and their family.
“I hope you are faring well and that the __________ hasn’t been too stressful for you and your family.”
Not the most original line, but it doesn’t sound contrived like other greetings. It also exhibits the acknowledgement of a specific factor (online transition of instruction, caring for a loved one who is ill, etc) that you haven’t generalized to all other emails.
“How is everything? I’ve started __________”
We are all (hopefully) at home and bored, so anyone would love to hear what their correspondents have been up to, from new hobbies to new cooking skills.
Just get to the point. 
If it’s already the third exchange, it might be easier to just say what you need to. Sometimes normalcy is appreciated, especially when everything is “trying” and “uncertain” nowadays.
In all seriousness though, in these difficult times please check in on your friends and mentors whenever you have a chance. A simple text or email can go a long way!
