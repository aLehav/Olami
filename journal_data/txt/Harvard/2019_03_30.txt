The first thing to note about Sara Porkalob’s “Dragon Lady,” which has returned to the Oberon a year after its 2018 run, is that she is the only actress. She begins her descent down a flight of stairs, and though there’s a traditional stage at the front of the audience, in reality, Porkalob is free to command the entire space: she hops onto the bar, grabs an audience member to dance, and pops in and out of the dizzying array of characters listed on the playbill without pausing. Porkalob wants to make it clear, early on, that this is not a story about “a normal family talking about politics or Tupperware,” but rather a story of pain, humor, and an unswerving sense of obligation from one generation to the next. It’s difficult at first to know how the play will end — where in one’s life do the curtains close as though the story is finished, even when it is not? — but Porkalob’s own birth, seen through the eyes of her mother Maria and her grandmother, is a fitting near-end to a moving show filled with biting one-liners that are both funny and unflinchingly true.
Porkalob tells her grandmother’s story through a series of interconnected flashbacks — first to her own childhood, when her grandmother originally told her these stories, then to the moments, many punctuated by karaoke, in which the stories actually play out.
Porkalob’s ability to portray roughly two dozen characters — in roughly two dozen distinct ways — deserves a word of praise. Any production with few actors or even one risks that characterization will be muddied. Such is not the case in “Dragon Lady,” however. The first interaction between Maria Porkalob Jr. and Maria Porkalob Sr. — Porkalob’s grandmother — highlights Porkalob’s agile shifting from one character to another and provides the first of many perspectives into her grandmother’s loving fierceness.
This trait evolves over the course of the play, but never wavers in its intensity. As a young mother she says, “I want you to take this golf club… If you don’t kill her, I will kill you,” and only a few years later, upon meeting her granddaughter, says, “Can I hold the little cheesecake baby?” Porkalob delivers both these lines with an aggressiveness that only just reveals the love Maria Porkalob Sr. has for her family. Much of the play focuses on the physical and emotional sacrifices Porkalob’s grandmother made to save herself and raise her children, but these choices are akin to an ocean swirling around an iceberg: There are only small explicit demonstrations of love, even though beneath the surface lies a deep desire to see nothing but the best for the generations that follow.
Tidal movements can act as a metaphor for the play as a whole. Porkalob’s choice to interweave her grandmother’s songs with Peter Irving’s original compositions for the play itself propels the narrative from one moment in the past to another, linking the emotional gravitas of disparate events through song. Even the genres of music vary from one portion of the play to the next: Disco and musical theater intermingle as if to unify anecdotes that take place across the decades.
The comical moments — such as when a young Maria Sr. is caught up in the interests of a naval officer and cannot resist saying, “He was tall and majestic, at least five-foot-six” — support a darker commentary on and the inevitable misunderstanding by younger generations as they look back on the choices she has made. These one-liners are powerful in their own way, but the emotional apex of the play is near the very end, after Maria Jr. gives birth at 19, demonstrating that sometimes history does have a tendency to repeat itself. Maria Sr. knows this, telling Maria Jr. that she didn’t want her to repeat her own past, a concept that is a common refrain in the play and encapsulates one type of immigrant pain, which explains Maria Sr.’s metaphorical absence throughout the story as she struggles to support her children from afar.
Yet the climax does not end with this scene; rather, it ends with the last scene in “Dragon Lady,” the appearance of Porkalob’s grandmother on stage. The two women, of course, sing together, and in one moment they simply look at each other. The play’s entirety leads to that one fittingly beautiful exchange of mutual understanding and love.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Graduate students and professors alike will soon crowd the Barker Center for a conference titled “Bad Romance: The Ethics of Love, Sex, and Desire,” which will explore academic perspectives on sexual questions and issues in the context of the #MeToo movement. The conference will feature panels on consent, global sexualities, sex in history, and sex’s relationship to the Internet.
Rebecca D. Rothfeld — a third-year philosophy Ph.D student who co-organized the conference with Tess McNulty, a fourth-year Ph.D English student — said the idea for the conference stemmed from their mutual interest in the conversations around the #MeToo movement.
“I think because we have analytical philosophical backgrounds, we found a lot of the discourse around #MeToo unsatisfying because there were a lot of quick hot takes, and we wanted to see more thoughtful consideration,” Rothfeld said.
“Bad Romance” is an interdisciplinary conference, featuring visiting panelists and speakers from fields including English, sociology, philosophy, comparative literature, the history of art and architecture, and African and African American studies. Friday evening will feature the keynote address, “Let’s Talk About Sex: Ethical Intercourse in the Age of #MeToo,” from Nancy Bauer.
“I’m really excited to see academic discussion of issues related to sexual ethics, because there isn’t much, at least in philosophy historically,” Rothfeld said.
Jillian Luke, a visiting fellow from the University of Edinburgh, will present a paper on the role of blushing in traditionally male interpretations of the female body in Shakespeare’s time.
“When it comes to blushing, men assume that what their body is saying is more meaningful than what their words are saying. My paper is asking whether we can recover the reading of silence from the misogynist way in which it is used by men in shakespeare as an act of empathetic feminist criticism,” she said.
Luke also said that such an interdisciplinary conference has the potential to be “fruitful” for present and future research.
“Getting to participate in graduate level conferences is really exciting because that is often the place where you get exposed to new ideas,” she said. “It’s quite easy to get siloed into just thinking about the period in which you work or even the discipline in which you work.”
University of Pennsylvania graduate student Sarah I. Adeyinka-Skold, whose paper focuses on the sociology of women and dating in the digital age, also said she looks forward to hearing researchers from other disciplines.
“For me this conference serves as a place to talk about finding love in the digital age, and sometimes in people's desperation to have this, they manipulate or create relations that are uncomfortable for women,” she said.
“Bad Romance: The Ethics of Love, Sex, and Desire” begins on Friday at 2:30 p.m. and will run through Saturday at 5:45 p.m. in the Barker Center.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the dim Loeb Experimental Theater, cast members of "for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf” don costumes of a spectrum of colors. Collectively, they form a visually rainbow-themed cast. In this current production of a genre-bending work by Ntozake Shange, Black C.A.S.T. aims to communicate a story of resilience.
“It’s a chance to celebrate the beauty of black women, and a chance to celebrate and even question what it means to be a black woman,” Emily N. Orr ’21, the show’s producer, said.
The play, which premiered in 1976, is a monologue-based production that explores seven African-American women’s personal stories of resilience in the face of difficult circumstances. These seven unnamed women, identified only by the colors they wear, take the viewers on a journey told through colloquially-spoken poems on topics ranging from complicated relationships, to experiences with rape and abortion, to finding self-acceptance.
The production does not follow a standard chronological cause-and-effect storyline, since Shange deliberately constructed this anthology-like production to be a choreopoem. A term invented by Shange herself to characterize “for colored girls,” “choreopoem” describes a theatrical production that intertwines poetry, music, and dance, allowing performers to let each form of artistic expression enhance the others.
First-time director Devonne D. Pitts ’21 says she has appreciated this inherent flexibility of the format of “for colored girls” and identifies it as a driving factor of the play.
“This is so much more free in its form and content, and tackling that meant I had to be as open creatively and artistically as I possibly could be to just let in whatever juices were flowing through,” Pitts said. “It allows for the audience, the actors, and anyone who touches this piece to weave their own way into the story as they see fit.”
Genesis N. De Los Santos ’19, who plays the Lady in Blue, explained that she has had an illuminating experience playing a character that grapples with some of the more difficult subject material in the play. “As an actor, I wanted to ensure that I was devoting myself to my character in a healthy way where I wasn’t sacrificing my mental health, but also still devoting myself to being vulnerable,” De Los Santos said. “This production has been a space where I have been able to find a sense of healing and closure with certain things.”
Demonstrating the strength of healing is a common thread for the actors in the play. For Evelyn M. Manyatta ’22, who plays the Lady in Green, the struggles explored in the play converge to a hopeful meaning, making the play deeper than just a painful revisiting of traumatic events.
“In the end, it shows the strength of people who have gone through this,” Manyatta said. “Our play takes them back and shows them, look, you’re here ー you’re standing, you’re strong, and you’re more than this intense middle part of the play. You are at the end of the rainbow.”
Ultimately, Pitts hopes that the play’s themes and approach will leave a lasting impact on the viewers. “This play has ups and downs ー it’s an emotional rollercoaster, but I think people will see it as a beneficial experience,” Pitts said. “My one goal is that they walk away feeling something ー having connected with the play viscerally in some way.”
“for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf” runs March 29–April 6 in the Loeb Experimental Theater.
