After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Update 4:59 p.m.
Former Overseer and intellectual property lawyer William F. Lee ’72 has been selected to serve on the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—the University announced today.
The selection of the first Asian American to the Corporation marks a milestone in the governing body’s history, and Lee’s appointment comes 10 years after the Corporation selected its first black member, Conrad K. Harper.
Lee will replace long-serving member James R. Houghton ’58, who joined the Corporation in 1995 and, in 2002, became its senior fellow—a position members have in the past described as a first among equals.
“[Lee] has interests and experience that range from law and education and public service to science and technology and medicine,” said  Robert D. Reischauer, ’63, who chaired the search committee and will succeed Houghton as senior fellow. “And he’s stayed closely involved with Harvard across the years.”
Lee is currently a co-managing partner of the law firm WilmerHale, one of the nation’s most prestigious law firms.
Lee has also taught intellectual property litigation courses as well as the problem-solving workshop introduced this year at Harvard Law School.
The former Adams House resident graduated from the College magna cum laude in 1972 and subsequently received business and law degrees from Cornell.
Lee will begin his term on the Corporation when Houghton steps down on July 1.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Where it began/ I can’t begin to know when…”
It only takes a few notes of Neil Diamond’s classic for any Boston Red Sox fan—or any baseball fan, for that matter—to instantly recognize "Sweet Caroline," the song that’s become the anthem for America’s pastime in Beantown.
While Harvard’s O’Donnell Field may not have exactly the same aura as Fenway, you can bet it still has the music. At the Crimson baseball team’s home opener this week, everything from a soulful Johnny Cash ballad to Sublime’s reggae-infused “Badfish” played through the speakers, keeping the crowd entertained during breaks between innings.
Even if Harvard’s variety of songs was a bit different from those commonly heard at baseball games across America, the tradition of music at sporting events traces back to the very beginning of competition.
In fact, historical documents reveal that the ancient Greeks viewed music as an important part of the Olympics.
The modern sports fan is most likely to recognize perennial hits like Queen’s “We Will Rock You” and “We Are the Champions,” the more traditional “Take Me Out to the Ballgame,” or the Village People’s undying crowd sing-along  “Y.M.C.A.” as staples in American sporting culture.
With many more games to come at O’Donnell Field, you can bet that the Crimson’s fans will hear at least one of the classics sometime soon. And with the Harvard band making at appearance at today’s softball doubleheader—playing personalized walk-up songs for every Crimson player—live entertainment could be on the horizon.
But "10,000 Men of Harvard" or not, our money’s on Survivor’s platinum single and karaoke favorite, “Eye of the Tiger," ringing across the river soon.
