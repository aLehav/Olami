After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For one moment on March 22, the Boch Center Wang Theatre in Boston resembled a church on Sunday morning. The audience members stood on their feet, exuberantly chanting the religious refrain “Rocka My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham” and dancing from side to side. On stage, members of the critically acclaimed Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater company finished their final dance and waved goodbye with a smile.
The New York-based company, which celebrates its 60th anniversary this month, arrived in Boston for five performances from March 22 to 25. With four pieces from different time periods, the show provided living proof of the long journey that the company—and the country—has traveled in the past six decades. In 1968, the company was just a small group of seven black dancers, led by Ailey; today it is is one of the world’s most preeminent and celebrated modern dance ensembles, often referred to as America’s “Cultural Ambassador to the World.”
The performance on Thursday started with “Members Don’t Get Weary,” a recent piece from 2017 choreographed by Jamar Roberts, a veteran dancer with the company. When the lights came on, the mellow sound of a saxophone filled the theater. The dancers, wearing wide straw hats, repeatedly reached their hands towards an unseen horizon. Defined by the choreographer as “a response to the current social landscape in America,” the piece shifted swiftly from moments of profound pain to moments of powerful solidarity. Its soundtrack, composed by the American saxophonist John Coltrane, infused the movement with rhythm and life.
The next piece was “The Golden Section,” which was choreographed by Tony award winner Twyla Tharp and premiered in 1983. The Ailey company first performed it in 2006. Set to a new wave rock score by David Byrne and featuring dancers wearing all gold, it provided the perfect 80s experience, an interesting contrast to the first piece. It was a memorable performance full of joy and buoyancy, composed as an 18-minute-long sequence of upbeat leaps, swirls, and turns.
Following an intermission, the highlight of the performance began: “In/Side,” a heartbreaking male solo performed by Samuel Lee Roberts and choreographed by the company’s artistic director, Robert Battle. It was one man’s journey through the labyrinth in the depths of his troubled soul, set to the moving sound of Nina Simone’s version of the Oscar-nominated song “Wild is the Wind.” Over the course of only eight minutes, Lee Roberts explored with his body a spectrum of emotions: He jumped, span, ran away, hid, rose, and fell; he was tormented and elevated, rejected and accepted.
The evening culminated with “Revelations,” choreographed by the company’s founder, Ailey. Widely regarded as Ailey’s all-time masterpiece, “Revelations” has become a cultural phenomenon. Even though it was originally created during the civil rights movement, the piece hasn’t lost its relevance; it is not less poignant in 2018 than it was in its premiere in 1960. It celebrates the richness and the beauty of black heritage, which has been so often underestimated. Ailey himself described black art as “sometimes sorrowful, sometimes jubilant, but always hopeful.”
In their meticulous, inspiring ensemble work, the dancers created a dazzling vision of faith and optimism. At 36 minutes, “Revelations” encompassed a variety of colors and atmospheres. The soundtrack mostly consisted of religious refrains, but included a wide gamut of rhythms and voices, from the angelic “Fix Me, Jesus” to the pounding “Wade in the Water.” Over the constantly shifting movement and sounds hovered one uniting spirit—that of Ailey, who worked diligently to democratize modern dance and make it more accessible to underprivileged communities. “Dance is for everybody,” he said famously. “I believe that it came from the people and that it should always be delivered back to the people.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Dec. 28, 1998, a 19-year old black woman fell asleep in her aunt’s car after getting stuck in a gas station with a flat tire. Foaming at the mouth in an apparently comatose sleep, and with a gun in her lap, she was shot in her car at least 12 times by police officers who were never prosecuted. Her story parallels those of many other black victims of police brutality. Her name was Tyisha Miller. Sound familiar?
Inspired by the events surrounding Miller’s death, “My Name is Myeisha” is director Gus Krieger’s adaptation of Rickerby Hinds’ play “Dreamscape.” An entry in the Boston Underground Film Festival, the film follows the three separate, juxtaposed narratives of Myeisha sleeping in the car, Myeisha stuck in a warped combination of the sunken place from “Get Out” and her own subconscious sleep, and snippets of Myeisha’s life. “My Name is Myeisha”’s overuse of original elements and unoriginal use of familiar tropes take from Myeisha’s story, but cannot detract from Myeisha herself.
“Just so you know, this ain’t gonna be one of them feel-good shows. Just so you know,” Myeisha warns at the start of the film, one of many obvious statements that come to characterize the movie. “My Name is Myeisha” resorts to familiar tactics to navigate the racial politics of police brutality. “Man, I wish I was a white girl,” Myeisha laments. Krieger then cuts to a white couple whose All Lives Matter rhetoric feels tired. “Actually, cops kill more white people than black,” the blonde, blue-eyed woman says, completely missing the point. Myeisha’s retort that the police’s responsibility is “to protect and to serve, written in black and white, right?” falls on deaf ears. Instead of letting the events of Myeisha’s murder speak for themselves, Krieger shirks subtlety in an overtly unproductive way.
Krieger’s lack of subtlety takes from the world he tries to create as well. Set in the ‘90s, “My Name is Myeisha”’s attempts to criticize the objectification of women read like Krieger pandering to today’s audience. When Myeisha and her friends are invited to star in a music video, they jump at the opportunity to get their 15 minutes of fame. But when the resulting video features only the women’s dancing backsides, Myeisha scoffs at their oversexualization. The point Krieger is trying to make is important, but the methods he uses to tell it feel too overplayed to strike a loud enough chord. The explicit social criticism doesn’t ring in Myeisha’s voice, but rather in a voice that feels more like Krieger’s unsuccessful integration of his “woke” agenda.
The film plays with repetition to the point of near incongruity in what is the film’s most obvious innovation: “My Name is Myeisha” is a tragic adaptation of a true story, but it is also a beatboxing, spoken word-based musical. John Merchant, who plays various characters throughout the movie including a strange man who assaults Myeisha, a policeman, and a coroner, alternates too quickly between speaking his lines and beatboxing. His beatboxing breaks the dialogue in a way that pulls viewers out of the movie, at which point they feel slapped into the film. The film loses its power most in these moments, when it ceases to feel like a musical and veers toward the nonsensical. While the interspersed dancing and music feel fresh, the constant beatboxing and repetition of the spoken-word verses become distracting as Krieger over-employs these tools.
One such verse evokes Myeisha’s helplessness. “Ever have one of those dreams where nothing comes out when you try to scream?” she asks at different moment throughout the film. Myeisha’s fate may be sealed, but Rhaechyl Walker’s performance infuses the character she plays with an undeniable humanity. The film hinges on Walker’s portrayal of Myeisha as the unquestionable star, and she does not disappoint. From the choreography Walker seamlessly executes to her delivery of Myeisha’s spoken-word poetry, Walker makes Myeisha and all her quirks familiar to us in a way that does not feel forced.
“This is Myeisha. You know me,” Myeisha confirms as the film nears its tragic end. Indeed, the film succeeds not as a retelling of Myeisha’s story, but more as an introduction to Myeisha, the person. Krieger paints a nonlinear mosaic of a story that, when pieced together, make up who Myeisha is. And while the snippets themselves are not unique to Myeisha—hasn’t everyone struggled with the awkwardness of puberty and the thrill of first love?—the youth with which Walker portrays them breathe life into her character. As she shuffles around in braces to treat both her scoliosis and her crooked teeth, as she enjoys the delight of filling out a bra for the first time, as she recounts her less-than-fantastic first time having sex, Krieger reframes Myeisha not as a victim, but as a young woman whose life was just about to flourish but was ultimately cut short in a situation that has become all too commonplace.

First-time director Christopher Bickel produced an unlikely gem in the form of his existential horror film “The Theta Girl” on a mere budget of $14,000. The basic plot of the film, an entry at the Boston Underground Film Festival, is relatively simple: To raise money for her friends’ all girl punk band, The Truth Foundation, Gayce (Victoria Elizabeth Donofrio) sells a drug called theta that brings its users into a shared hallucination of a metaphysical entity. At a retro nightclub where her band performs, Gayce inadvertently catches the attention of a horde of bible thumpers led by Brother Marcus (Shane Silman). In response to Brother Marcus’ short sermon on the sinfulness of drinking, the bartender doses the Jesus freaks’ cokes with theta, launching them and a few others into an alternate reality where the bird-like Entity (Nikki Gonzalez) presides. Outside the club, Gayce finds her “best fucking friend,” Leonard (Kenneth Briere) dead and his spaniel Bo missing, provoking her to hunt down the killer.
At times unapologetically gory, “The Theta Girl” balances over-the-top sex and gore with more subtly suspenseful and sometimes heartwarming scenes. Bickel produces a gritty exploration of a surreal world of theta-induced hallucinations experienced by characters ranging from punk rock band members to Bible thumpers, a conceit reminiscent of ’80s slasher films that may not be for everyone.
The film begins with a hypnotizing opening sequence in which Gayce, the titular Theta Girl, prowls through nighttime streets and seedy alleys. A young drug dealer sporting a leather jacket, combat boots, and dark-blue eyeliner, Gayce has all the markings of a street punk who exudes toughness and confidence. Yet while her fearlessness throughout the film is refreshing, it is her moments of innocence and tenderness that are truly surprising, presenting her as a real person caught in the midst of unsettling ridiculousness. Take, for example, her interactions with Leonard, a mute homeless man who lives behind the club with his cute spaniel, Bo. While brief and reticent, Gayce’s conversations with Leonard captures a completely different side of her personality, one that adds a heartfelt facet to her initially one-dimensional fierceness. Because of her love and protectiveness over her best friend, however, Gayce is determined to violently avenge his death.
Showing blatant disregard for its viewers’ comfort levels, mediocre production value came to the detriment of the shock value of “The Theta Girl.” While the constant slasher-esque depictions of blood and guts proved appalling at first, they became less shocking over time. In a particularly grisly scene, Gayce finds Leonard’s intestines sprawled out on the ground in the form of a theta symbol—a scene of gore with little thematic significance. The gratuitous gore might have damned the movie entirely, if not for its contrast to more tactfully eerie scenes, including one in which the theta-induced Entity appears shortly after Gayce finds Leonard’s body. Speaking in a screechy warble with equally creepy subtitles, The Entity, a pale bird woman, torments Gayce until she collapses and begs it to leave, for which it taunts her that it cannot because “I’m just you, after all.” The contrast between the cheerful backdrop of vibrant, cartoonish trees behind The Entity and The Entity itself only heightens the uneasiness that accompanies each Theta trip.
There’s also a surprisingly redemptive emotional heart at the center of horror movie tropes at work in “The Theta Girl.” Gayce’s conversation with Leonard exemplifies the abrupt insertion of heartwarming humanity, amidst general disturbing substance. Gayce’s conversation with Derek (Darelle D. Dove), her dealer, is another unexpectedly heartfelt scene taking place shortly after a blood-fest in a church. Caught carrying drugs, Gayce and Derek attempt to escape the police as they speed through the freeway. Livid at their carelessness, Gayce declares she has no interest in learning Derek’s name. Derek then decides that they should turn themselves in, a suggestion against which Gayce pleads unsuccessfully. In a rare moment of clarity, Gayce asks Derek for his name and he responds, prompting her to directly address him. In response, Derek throws her out of the car to prevent the police from finding her.
Although “The Theta Girl” may not be a technically polished movie with a coherent storyline, its smooth integration of existentialism, slasher horror, and punk rock proves that it can handle many concepts at once and deliver. Whether shaken or inspired, its viewers won’t leave it feeling unbothered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Undergraduate Council recently voted to subsidize and, subsequently, increase subsidies for the purchase of bicycles, skateboards, and scooters by students with demonstrated financial need living in the Quad, Dudley House, or off-campus. This scope was expanded at a second meeting to include Dunster and Mather Houses. It is heartening that the UC is looking to directly address financial disparities on campus, but the details of this specific plan leave much to be desired.
First, not all students with financial need who could benefit from the program are eligible. While the UC was right to extend the program to Dunster and Mather Houses, other students—including those in Leverett, which is merely the width of Cowperthwaite Street closer to the Yard than Dunster is—face comparable traveling distances to those who live in the areas in which residents are eligible.
This arbitrary exclusion is far from the only problem with the new initiative. An alternative method proposed at the first of these two meetings, which suggested the UC purchase bikes for eligible students to use and then return to the Council’s possession was not selected. One representative argued that this method would stigmatize using the bicycles that the UC purchased.
This line of logic is misguided. There are simple ways to avoid this issue, including purchasing a diverse assortment of bicycles, skateboards, and scooters and orchestrating discreet pick-ups and drop-offs, to overcome any potential stigma of using UC-sponsored transportation. This failed proposal would have been financially savvier, too: By allowing the UC to maintain ultimate ownership of the bicycles, skateboards, and scooters it purchased, the cost of the program would be one-time instead of annual.
Furthermore, while this program could have been better-implemented, it would have remained problematic due to the nature of the transportation it subsidizes. Since Boston experiences snow and rain for much of the year, bicycles, skateboards, and scooters are difficult to use on a regular basis. Additionally, many students have expressed discontent with the main form of transport to the Quad—the Quad shuttle system—despite its expanded schedule and the plethora of mobile applications aimed at tracking it. A potentially more workable solution to students’ transit woes would be for the UC to instead consider a ride-sharing service subsidy.
These monetarily and practically savvier alternatives would have been shrewd for the UC, which has poorly managed its finances in the past. That the body tapped into its Emergency Fund to finance student grants during the first of these two meetings indicates that this trend shows no signs of abating. Given the majority of the UC’s operating budget comes from students, it should be more responsible with its spending. It would do well to remember that its power is derived from students’ and family members’ pocketbooks, and that this necessitates a degree of fiduciary responsibility that UC has not shown.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another school shooting. More teenagers murdered. Another cycle of tragedy, outrage, demand for action, inaction. Another gun control “debate” to be had. Another news cycle dominated. Another community scarred.
Something is different about Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Something is different about the vehement and vociferous student-led political activism that came out of this tragedy. Something is different about the vitriol directed against those who might be so saddened and overwhelmed by such evil that they might fall on their knees to pray, to think, to turn their hearts to a suffering community before defaulting to political activism.
Something is different about how student activist David Hogg says “our parents don’t know how to use a fucking democracy, so we have to,” compared to how Arapahoe High School students stood behind “Warriors always take care of one another” after their school shooting in 2013, and how the brother of a student killed at Columbine in 1997 turned his grief over his sister’s death into a powerful anti-bullying movement still reaching schools today.
Something is different about how division and strife and civil clash have reared their ugly heads with newfound force.
Perhaps all this stems from the notion that enough really is enough. One school shooting was one too many. Maybe we have reached a tipping point beyond which we must take to the streets in righteous anger and demand action from our elected representatives. Many of us are going to the streets out of a place of deep hurt and sorrow. There is absolutely a compelling case that this cycle has repeated itself just too many times.
I am fearful of some of the costs of all of this justifiable anger. When our passions and emotions run so high, we often fail to see those who might disagree with us as humans in our red-clouded gaze. When we say anyone affiliated with the NRA or who is skeptical of the efficacy of additional firearm regulation is a cold-blooded murderer who actively desires the death of children, or when we claim that someone who supports additional firearm regulation is a raving lunatic who wants to take away everyone’s guns and strike the second amendment from the Constitution, we are guilty of a grave crime. When we heap this hatred on each other, we murder each other in our hearts and minds.
When we devolve in this way, we eliminate entirely the possibility for progress. There are, I believe, real grounds for productive policy discussions on why current firearms regulations failed to prevent these atrocities and what other measures could be taken. There are also real opportunities for responsible gun owners to demonstrate how they believe guns are not toys, and how learning to handle one safely can preserve proper respect for a firearm’s destructive end while diminishing irrational fear of the weapon itself.
Misinformation and hyperbole widen an already-growing cultural chasm. Facts, evidence, and reason will be supremely important in a world where a national publication like USA Today can publish an egregiously misleading graphic depicting a “chainsaw bayonet” as a possible modification of an AR-15.
Rationality matters in a world where one of the Parkland activists can claim for purposes of exaggeration that “no one should own a gun that shoots 50 rounds a second” as they did during their visit to the IOP recently. Actually, an AR-15 can shoot 30 rounds maximum only as fast as the user can pull the trigger. That’s still very destructive, obviously. But we will not have a reasonable discussion about high-capacity magazines or semi-automatic weapons if we don’t even really know what they are.
Then again, it is enormously difficult to be clear-headed and rational when children have died. It is next to impossible to separate the personal from the political in such a time as this. There is a case to be made that our politicians are distant and opaque, regardless of where they fall on gun control, and that the anger turned towards them from all sides of the spectrum is justifiable. But surely there is also a cost to directing our rage towards our fellow citizens in vitriolic ways.
Of course, I can make my exhortations to reason from a place somewhat emotionally removed. I haven’t been in a school shooting, nor lost someone to gun violence. But my small Colorado suburb is minutes away from Columbine and Arapahoe High Schools and the Aurora theater where the ill-fated shooting took place in 2012. Some of my best friends and teammates attended those schools. I interned at the courthouse where the theater shooter was being tried in a capital case.
These stories, these people, are not lost on me. The scars and wounds remain long after the news cameras go away. The zeal for activism fades when we realize policy has no healing power. What does not fade away is the need to take care of one another, as Arapahoe students championed in the wake of tragedy and continue to champion.
I hope that political activism will not silence that need.

I have served Harvard for the past six years as a duly-elected member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, and in my last act, I call upon the next University president, and the Harvard Corporation members who take his counsel, to adopt ethical investment principles. At a minimum, Harvard should direct the Harvard Management Company to divest from fossils fuels to prevent the end of life as we know it through cascading climate-driven disasters. This single act would not only take steps to address the existential crisis of our time, but it would allow the University to lead its peers, as few, if any, American universities thus far have taken this important moral stance. I stand up for this mandate on behalf of my constituents—like the faculty who warned us, the alumni who agree, and the students we disappoint—because I serve Harvard. Many more experts than I have advocated for Harvard's leadership to take the responsible action of divesting. For instance, more than 200 Harvard faculty members, including top scientists in the field, have called on the University to divest from fossil fuel corporations. The movement to divest is large and thoroughly mainstream, comprised of many other top schools, cities, including New York City, as well as the Church of England and some pension funds. Their commitments to divest over the next few years now cover over $6 trillion in assets. So, our request, with these august endorsements, is not radical—but recalcitrance is. Especially because it is so influential, Harvard should give moral direction to how HMC manages the endowment. These principles should be determined by the Harvard Corporation and the president, not HMC. Principles of responsibility, though otherwise common in the University’s governance, are long overdue in Harvard's investments, which must also be consistent with the altruistic purpose of this oldest of American universities, one that commands the resources of a small country, is the most famous college in the world, and whose motto is Veritas.Ironically, the University would have seen better endowment returns over the last ten years had Harvard's leadership listened to the student and faculty movement and instructed HMC to divest from oil, coal, and gas. Fossil fuel companies have been among the worst performing sector of the market for the past 5 years, in no small part because of legitimate concerns that inevitable climate regulation will leave them with fuel reserves they can never bring to market and burn. Even Colin Butterfield, who runs natural resource investing for HMC, said he has paused all further fossil fuel investments for fear of poor returns and also because "it's stealing from the future." Moreover, studies have established that abstinence from one of the many sectors in our economy has no discernible effect on returns. Harvard would do better investing according to its values, by ruling out positions that foment environmental harm, and simultaneously avoiding unsustainable investment practices. As the head of HMC has stated, comparing investment returns fundamentally requires considering risk taken. And unless we speedily counter fossil fuel dependence, the economy itself is doomed. Recently, the insurance industry warned that if the world endures two degrees Celsius of temperature increase, systemic problems in insurance will emerge due to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather impacts. Imagine a business world that is not insurable. Clearly, the riskiest thing to do is nothing. University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will take over as Harvard's 29th president this June. Bacow used to teach environmental science, and he certainly understands what the world faces if we don't reduce emissions and re-sequester carbon fast. I ask, and already asked, him to hear earnestly what Harvard students and faculty have been exhorting: to direct HMC to place the considerable heft of our endowment dollars in alignment with the academic and moral leadership Harvard has already shown on so many issues. I am not saying this be completed tomorrow, as the process can take a few years, but it should start now, and it should be put on a tight schedule. Taking this first stance could give leadership insights into other pressing issues like mass incarceration, toxins into our environment, and the exploitation of labor, but let us begin with divesting from fossil fuels now. I am not going public with this call to action lightly or to be impolite. I have tried everything else—diplomatically in the background with other Overseers and outspokenly but behind closed doors in plenary. But this is too important for me to remain silent. It's because I love Harvard that I am compelled to speak with all the force of my position before it extinguishes. Harvard once refused to divest from companies doing business with apartheid South Africa in spite of a moral movement on campus. I marched in the student protests in 1980 and received the same disregard we are dishing out to our future leaders now. After ten years of dismissal, and the election of no less than Bishop Tutu to the Board of Overseers, Harvard finally reversed itself. Let's not repeat this mistake. It's time for Harvard to stop owning climate change. We can make money ethically, with more resilient returns too. We don't just get profit from what we finance in this life, we endorse the activities underlying that profit—there is nowhere to hide from that. It is because we love our country and its most respected institutions that we call out the highest standards to which they must live. Kathryn A. “Kat” Taylor ’80 is a member of the Board of Overseers.

HOOVER, Ala. — “When I dream, I still dream that I’m walking around and being normal.”
Six months after a freak accident in his first football game as a college athlete, Ben M. Abercrombie ’21 remains paralyzed from the neck down. Regardless of what he envisions in his sleep, Ben cannot walk; he cannot breathe without a ventilator. He can flex some muscles in his upper body, but not enough to move his arms. Even that is a recent development.
So, every morning, he wakes up reminded of his immobility. “And I just wait for somebody else to move me,” he says.
After a four-month stint recovering out-of-state, Ben is back in his native Alabama. Twice a week, he loads into the colossal white van parked in his suburban driveway and heads to Spain Rehabilitation Center, where he has begun to re-teach his body to carry out basic motions.
On a pleasant morning in early March, he goes with his parents, Sherri and Marty, per usual. (“Only one time did Sherri miss,” Marty says, “’cause we were having a refrigerator delivered.”) One of his nurses, Daisy M. Golden, comes along.
Golden watches the proceedings quietly, for the most part—but she interjects to explain the trying nature of a debilitating injury like Ben’s. After 35 years of nursing, she knows the long and arduous process of recovery can bring out the worst in people. “I see sides of people that nobody sees. You’d be surprised,” she says.
And Ben, she emphasizes, “is the nicest patient I’ve ever had.”
At the Spain Rehabilitation Center, Ben steers himself down the van’s built-in ramp and into the facility. Everyone greets the family as they make their way through the building.
Ben approaches his physical training with intense focus. He needs to improve, even incrementally, because he is going to walk someday. At least that’s what he says. The science disputes it, but this is his goal; and Ben, historically, has had immense success getting his body to do what he wants.
The training requires a lot of fussing from Ben’s therapists and parents. They readjust his clothes, stick electrode pads to his limbs, reconfigure his body. He doesn’t mind this so much, he explains, so long as they treat him like an adult. “Sometimes, a new nurse will walk in and talk to me like I’m a baby. Like, I’m not a baby,” he says. “I’m just stuck here.”
In fact, until the Sept. 16 hit, Ben was, by all accounts, an outstanding athlete. He was in peak physical fitness, with a passion for sports, for football, for defensive tackles. Big hits were his specialty. Ben craved wins, an attitude bred in his cozy Southern hometown, where football is the center of the tight-knit community.
Ben’s tenacity and work ethic primed him for a successful career as a Harvard football player–until an entirely legal hit snapped his neck, compressing his spinal cord and essentially detaching his brain from the rest of his body.
At physical therapy, Marty and Sherri sit close to Ben, staring attentively at his minuscule movements. Amy Lippy, an occupational therapist who takes care of him, moves his arms up and down.
“Is it burning?” she asks him.
“Yeah,” he answers.
“Is it burning in both hands?”
“It’s burning all over.”
Lippy later explains where this burning comes from: neuropathic pain, which feels like third degree burns, “like everything is on fire.”
At one point during the training, one of the other therapists remarks that a muscle in Ben’s arm is “getting some action,” meaning it’s activating on its own. Marty stands up and bursts into applause.
When Ben takes a break, Marty whispers an explanation. “This is kinda like–we used to watch Ben in athletic events,” he says, with a glimmer of a smile.
“This is what it’s about now.”
Hoover, Alabama is a sprawling, hilly suburb of 85,000, ten miles outside Birmingham. People smile and wave out of habit. An Uber driver cheerfully describes fender benders as “a nice way to meet new people.”
 The town, according to Don H. Hulin, Hoover High’s principal, “centers around the school.”
Everyone is invested in the success of the high school, the largest in the state and Ben’s alma mater. “Community expectations are just extremely high,” he says, “and our kind of motto–unofficial motto–around here is, ‘Champions in all we do.’”
Hulin’s vocabulary is riddled with sports jargon, even when speaking about character and academics. He frames success as a binary–you win or you don’t. His office is crowded with plaques and trophies and photos, and he speaks glowingly about the achievements of his students.
Many of Hoover’s teams expect to play in state championships every year—and win.
“It’s all about a ring,” Hulin says. “They don’t wanna be the one that doesn’t get a state championship ring.”
No sport is as hallowed in Hoover as football.
Every fall Friday evening, the entire town congregates to watch teenage boys play the beloved game. The school’s stadium is too small for the enormous crowds, so the team plays home games at Hoover Metropolitan Stadium, a mile and a half from campus. The stadium seats 10,000.
“Friday nights, with high school football–I mean it’s just, it’s a part of our society,” Marty says. He and Sherri met when he played football in high school in Pleasant Groves, a nearby town. “The cheerleaders, the band, just those crisp fall evenings coming out of a hot summer–a lot of good memories,” he recalls.
Not much has changed since Marty’s days on the field.
“Football is like a religion in Alabama,” says Josh S. Niblett, Hoover High’s head football coach. He speaks seated in his office in the massive athletic wing of the school.
“It’s like a way of life,” Niblett says.
Niblett’s desk is decorated with frames–mostly filled with his family, but there’s a photo of Ben crouched with a football right at the front. Niblett points at the frame and beams. “There’s not many people that make my desk, alright, so I put special people up there,” he says.
 Down the hall, a mural immortalizes high-school Ben on the brick walls. He is grinning and fully upright, shoulder-to-shoulder with teammates.
A former University of Alabama player, Niblett remains in impeccable physical condition. Commanding and charismatic, he often speaks in aphorisms, which he delivers with the magnetic cadence of a preacher.
This makes sense, given he describes coaching as a “ministry.” He believes fervently in the virtue of the program.
Approximately 150 boys participate annually, a commitment that necessitates grueling physical and mental exertion—including weekly “mindset training” at 7:00 a.m. before school starts. The immediate goal is success on the field, but Niblett stresses broader life lessons, too.
“We’re trying to create them so when they take the trash out on Monday–because it’s trash day in Hoover on Monday–that they do it the greatest way that they could ever do it; when they brush their teeth in the morning, or they come into workouts; when they go into the classroom, and they have a homework assignment: it’s all about greatness,” he says.

In the ten years that he has run the program, he has become renowned for his holistic approach to coaching. Lippy describes Niblett as a “really huge celebrity in town.” She recalls a recent time her youngest son ran into Niblett.
“He came over and shook Brady’s hand,” she says, still awed.
Her older son is a freshman on the team, and she doesn’t know if he’ll ever play in a game. But, she says, “It’s a culture I want my kids involved in because it provides such structure and discipline and responsibility to other people besides just their family.”
The kind of esteem Niblett receives also extends to players. Once a year, “thousands of people” flock to the local mall, where the team signs autographs.
And then there are the legends. Like Ben.
“Even when we were younger, people always called him ‘Superman,’” Jayden T. Jordan, a high school football teammate, remembers.
Sherri recalls Ben’s early desire to play tackle football. After years of pestering, she and Marty finally allowed him to graduate from flag football in fourth grade. When he finished his first game, she remembers, he ran off the field abuzz. “‘That was awesome!’ Those were his first words about being able to just hit somebody.”
He’s relished tackling ever since.
As a high school star, he was a vicious competitor, says his longtime friend Drew K. Guffey. Every game, his teammates watched him “just tear people up all over the field.” But the Ben they knew off the field was humble and reserved.
“After the game, he’d walk off the field like nothing happened, you know? Like ‘What’s up guys, what’d I miss,’” Guffey says.
Ben was, according to Niblett, the ideal Hoover athlete. “He’s the kind of guy you’d want your daughter dating and the guy that you want leading your program, the guy that you want to be the face of your program,” he says.
Ben’s friends insist people viewed him this way even before the injury. “Whenever a tragedy happens to anybody,” reflects Guffey, “people only say good things about the person for obvious reasons. But with Ben, that’s the only thing you would say anyways.”
They called him “Badgercrombie.”
That was Ben’s locker room nickname at Harvard, bestowed by a senior player. It pays homage to Tyrann Matthieu, a Louisiana State player known for tenacity—despite his small size. Like Matthieu, Ben’s teammates claimed he resembled a badger, fearless and ferocious.
But the real significance of the moniker is the fact Ben had one at all.
“It’s very rare to me,” says Ryan Crawford, Ben’s former position coach, “for a freshman to have an impact to the point where, you know, he gets a cool nickname.” Freshmen nicknames, he says, are usually somewhat derogatory—“something that they’re kind of picking on you about.”
So having an honorific nickname like Ben’s is essentially “the highest level of respect that you can probably get as a freshman in a football locker room.”

It was a respect earned through ability and effort. Ben preferred to let his performance in practice speak for him. This attitude is unusual for a freshman, says Edward “Isaiah” Wingfield ’21, who plays the same position as Ben. Coming into their first season as college athletes, “The rest of us are talking each other up, talking ourselves up, talking trash. Ben is the guy in the back just waiting to strap on the pads.”
“So we really had no idea he was such a beast on the field, until he started playing,” Wingfield says.
As Ben reiterates in several interviews, he played football with a single goal: “I like to win.”
“I hate losing, like the feeling of losing, and I hate watching people win, especially on my field.”
 This approach to athletics transformed Ben from an antsy flag football player to a varsity star at one of the top 10 high school football programs in the nation; and from there, to a Division I college recruit. So when he stepped into Harvard Stadium, he was ready.
Harvard Head Coach Tim Murphy says he was immediately struck by Ben’s maturity as a player: he “had a high football IQ, was very developed in terms of his skill set, and was a kid that you projected as one of those maybe 10 freshmen that could be on the travel squad early.”
Even outside of practice, Ben spent most of his limited free time obsessively analyzing film, studying his own technique and the Harvard team’s strategy, according to his freshman-year roommates.
By the time the first game of the season rolled around, Ben had earned his way onto the travel squad—a rare achievement for someone so green. “He was the only freshmen on the bus that first road game against URI on the defensive side of the ball,” Crawford says. “But he earned that.”
When Ben played football, Crawford remembers, “it was like a switch was flipped.”
Like in his first game of tackle football, like in state championship games: “Ben excelled once we put on the pads and got to hit. That was his big thing,” Wingfield says.
The rest of the team viewed his playstyle as something extraordinary. But for Ben, it came down to a matter of modest logic. He abided by a simple philosophy:
“It doesn’t hurt if you hit them harder than they hit you.”
Ben wasn’t supposed to be on the field when it happened.
He traveled to University of Rhode Island expecting mostly to play on special teams; during kickoffs, punt returns, and field goals. But then starting safety Zachary J. Miller ’19 went down with an injury. Minutes later, his replacement, Cole M. Thompson ’19, left the game for the same reason. At the start of the second quarter, a mere 15 minutes into the game, Coach Murphy called for his third-string safety: number 32.
Badgercrombie, the big hitter, was ready.
He shared parting words of encouragement with fellow freshman BJ Watson ’21. Watson remembers psyching Ben up: “I was just talking to Ben, like, literally the play before, right before he goes on the field. He was just like, ‘Oh, I just can’t wait to hit somebody; can’t wait to hit somebody.’”
And then Ben sprinted onto the field, legs pumping, muscles surging.
Down in Hoover, Marty and Sherri were having connectivity issues. Harvard’s games aren’t regularly broadcasted, but the Rhode Island team had organized a live stream that Marty proudly managed to hook up to the television.
The feed was spotty. It would freeze and then jerk ahead, freeze and jerk–Harvard makes a play–freeze, jerk–players switch out–freeze, jerk–there’s Ben! Ben, playing in his first game!–freeze, jerk–
Third and fifteen: Rhode Island has the ball. The quarterback takes the snap, and the stadium watches as the play develops–a post corner on the Harvard sideline to big-bodied receiver Marven Beauvais. The quarterback releases the ball, and Ben flies toward Beauvais from behind.
“Everybody knows on the sideline–energy is raised–it’s about to be a hit. Like, we know it’s coming. I’m like, ‘Oh, Ben is gonna kill this man,’” Watson recalls. “And then the sideline says, like, ‘Ooh’ before it even happens”–not because anything’s gone wrong, but in anticipation of the crunch that only a football hit can produce–“because everybody knows it’s about to be a hit.”
And it is. Coach Murphy remembers: “Ben just comes up, just like he did on the high school film, just like he did a thousand times in high school football, and just like he did in practice, and hits the kid in midair.”
Beauvais, the Rhode Island receiver, catches the ball for an 18-yard gain. First down, Rhode Island. But the Harvard sideline is cheering anyway: the Big Hitter has delivered.
For a moment, the team celebrates. And then someone notices something isn’t quite right.
One player isn’t sharing in the excitement. One crimson jersey isn’t getting up.
“He just fell like a ladder, like a… just sort of frozen. And it didn’t look catastrophic, it just looked odd,” Murphy says.
“That’s when we realized that something was wrong,” Watson says. “’Cause he wasn’t moving. So then everybody got silent.”
Back in Hoover, the footage streams clear and uninterrupted. The stillness on the screen is not a malfunction of technology. There are a thousand miles between the Abercrombies and the boy on the screen, but they yell at the television anyway. “Please move, please move,” they beg. The camera moves, but Ben does not.
On the field in Rhode Island, coaches shout for aid and oxygen and prayer. Paramedics sprint onto the field and cart Ben away. The players wait, heads down, confused. Everyone is whispering and players’ knees start digging uncomfortably into the turf and no one knows anything except that Ben is out.
In the hush that settles over the stadium, Crawford recalls, everyone is thinking the same thing. “Any time a player gets carried off on a stretcher, everybody knows that it… you know… it… it… potentially has a chance to be, um, you know…”
“The worst situation.”
The silence metastasizes. There is an empty field and two teams of players, minus one 180-pound freshman.
Still, three quarters remain.
So both teams tentatively line back up at the URI 49-yard line. As Ben’s prone body speeds toward the hospital, someone blows a whistle, and the game proceeds.
Next play: touchdown, Rhode Island.
For the rest of the game, Watson says, even in the locker room, “It was just, like, silent.”
The game began with the infectious buzz of a season opener, something more than a series of runs and passes. But, after the hit, “It was like we were just playing football at that point,” Watson says.
There was no such numbness in Hoover. As soon as the camera panned away from Ben’s body, Marty and Sherri propelled themselves into action. Within minutes, Marty was on the phone with a friend who attended the Rhode Island game in person and was able to put the Abercrombies in touch with the medical team. Sherri searched for flights.
And then, because Hoover is Hoover–close-knit and magnetic–and because Ben is Ben–Superman, the one you want your daughter to date–the Abercrombies called on their community for help.
Six months later, Sherri and Marty sit on the same couch in the same living room from which they watched the Sept. 16 game. Marty is wearing a Harvard t-shirt. He gestures to the TV, now cold and dark, as he describes the helplessness he and his wife felt watching Ben collapse so many miles away. “You can imagine what kind of hell that was,” he says.
His voice begins to shake as he recounts the first moment he had to say out loud, to another person, how terribly wrong the game had gone. “I called Chris DeGreen”—a Hoover minister and close friend—“and told him Ben was injured.”
Marty pauses, chest heaving. Through his tears: “I said, ‘We need you to pray immediately.’”
(Later, Marty apologizes for getting emotional. Even half a year later, “All that–that’s always right beneath the surface,” he says.)
He asked DeGreen to begin a “prayer chain.” By the end of the day, remembers Amy Lippy–Ben’s occupational therapist, who, at the time of the injury, had never met Ben–“we all knew.”
“We were in deep prayer,” Coach Niblett says. “Everybody started thinking about him… our community, word spreads quick.”
Downstairs, where the one-time basement has been converted to a wheelchair-friendly living space, Ben recounts his own version of the story.
“Oh, I remember everything,” he says. “I remember hitting the kid, and right after I hit him, I was like, ‘Well, I’m paralyzed.’ ’Cause I could tell. Like right when I hit him, I just knew.”
Ben couldn’t move anything. He watched his limbs fall around him in slow motion, as though disconnected from his body–“ghost arms and legs,” he calls them.
“It’s really hard to explain, but it was like, I saw my arms go up... like, in a misty vision, go up… and then my legs did the same. Like they were stretching, like stretching up.”
He remembers voices asking if he could feel this or that, but he couldn’t, and then he heard someone pronounce his neck broken.
“And then I was trying to talk. I was like—I opened my mouth and couldn’t breathe and I was like, ‘I can’t breathe.’ I was going in and out of consciousness and they were like, ‘Stay with me!’ and then I passed out.”
Spinal cord injuries like Ben’s are fairly rare in football. But his debilitating accident comes in the middle of a fraught national conversation about the future of the sport.
After all, the injury was “something that was not caused by poor technique on his part,” as Murphy says. The play was completely textbook. Ben played by the rules, the same way he had thousands of times before.
“I would like to have some experts look at it and, you know, kind of make a determination, just looking towards the future,” Marty says, of “how can the game be made safer.”
Marty isn’t the only one. Concern about the safety of football is at an all-time high, although most of the current dialogue revolves around concussions. This summer, a New York Times article examining permanent brain damage in 110 NFL players went viral.
“People are really becoming much more aware of the potential damage to the brain in particular, so you’re seeing it decline in ratings, NFL ratings, TV ratings; you’re seeing a decline in participation among high schools,” says Robert Hohler, a journalist who has covered sports for the Boston Globe since 2000.
Some changes have already been instituted. Two years ago, the NFL implemented a change to their kickoff rule in an attempt to decrease the number of runbacks, a particularly violent kind of collision. (The NCAA has proposed adopting a slightly different rule with the same intent for its 2018 season. It will discuss the proposals on April 13 of this year.) But the NFL rule change did not have quite the impact critics hoped for–ESPN’s statistical arm, FiveThirtyEight, determined the percentage of kickoff returns did not change significantly after the new rule was implemented. Whether the NCAA rule would have a significant effect is yet to be determined.
The Ivy League has gone further. In 2016, all eight coaches in the Ivy League voted to eliminate full-contact hitting from practices during the season, which the New York Times called “the most aggressive measure yet to combat growing concerns about brain trauma and other injuries in the sport.”

Some believe rehabilitating football will take more than rewriting (some of) the rules.
Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and faculty adviser to the basketball team, thinks a lot about the game.
Walton is a central figure for some athletes at Harvard: he hosts athletes at his home weekly, travels with teams on road trips, and acts as a resource for them outside of the classroom. He played football in college, and says he “learned valuable lessons from football that continue to inform and animate my professional life.”
There is, he says, a compelling argument to be made for the cultural benefit of athletic programs in higher education.
Ben’s resident dean Jasmine Waddell agrees. “Athletes bring a lot to the community,” she says. “They bring leadership, they bring health, passion. They’re ambassadors.”
But given the medical risks of playing a game that demands physical collision, Walton and other football fans say they feel conflicted about the sport. “It’s worth having a moral debate around the ethics of the sport,” he says.
“We’re taught that the harder we can hit or the better we can take a hit means that we’re a real man.”
Safety concerns are inherent in a culture that sanctions this kind of mentality, Walton says.
“Why do so many older college athletes and pro athletes want to get back in the game even after they know they may have symptoms of a concussion; why do so many of us risk life and limb often on the football field?” Walton asks. “Because we’ve been conditioned at such an early age that that is what makes us strong, that’s what makes us winners, that’s how we become champions. And we have to do better than that. We owe our young men more than that.”
Walton advocates a revised approach to football–one that focuses on developing technique and strategy as opposed to unleashing aggression, so that the game can “not just become about the savage brutality of trying to see who can land the biggest hit on another.”
But Hohler says even fundamental changes to the game might not stymie swelling national trends.
“I think there’s a cultural shift going on. How many years or decades that may take, in what geographical shape it may take,” he isn’t sure. But this he believes: “It’s precipitating a shift, a cultural shift away from football.”
Hohler’s theory, however, does not seem to fully apply to the Abercrombies–the game paralyzed their son, and yet they still structure their weekends around it, still watch it religiously.
Ben, too, harbors an undiminished love for the sport. “I think football is still the great American sport, especially down south,” he says.
Ben says he doesn’t regret “anything,” not even the hit that took his mobility.
“Because I would’ve done the same thing,” he says. “I wouldn’t have changed my mind or taken the easy way out.”
The Abercrombies believe, fundamentally, in the game. Except that every once in a while, they watch plays with a slight pang.
“I used to love to see hard hits,” Marty says. “Now I don’t enjoy seeing the big hits anymore. When I see one I’m like, ‘Ooh’”–he contorts his face–“somebody could have got hurt.”
For Ben, the feeling is a little different. “Sometimes I see hits and I feel like, ‘How is he not hurt?’ How does he not hurt and I got hurt? Sometimes a hit will look a lot worse, and they’ll duck their heads or something.”
“And how is he not broken and I am?”
“Ben says he doesn’t remember it, but we remember it vividly: Ben opened his eyes and saw us, heard our voices,” Marty says.
The Abercrombies didn’t quite know what to expect when they sprinted into their son’s room in the Rhode Island Hospital, car left running directly in front of the entrance. They only knew he was alive.
“A lot of people that have as severe of spinal cord injuries as Ben don’t survive the first day,”  Marty says. “Most spinal cord injuries are from car crashes,” where medical support is much further away. “If people didn’t get to him for 30 minutes, he could be dead.”
Under the diligent watch of his doctors and parents, Ben began to recover. Eventually–after a bout of pneumonia–he was transferred to the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, which specializes in spinal cord recovery, where he stayed for three months. He returned home in mid-January.
At all stages, Ben had a cadre of visitors.
“I remember I walked in the room,” childhood friend Devin A. Cole says of his first visit to the hospital, “and I just saw him on the bed... and I just... I tried not to show my reaction too much ‘cause I knew that he was going through a lot. But it was really hard to hold back my emotion. It was just unreal.”
“But then he just looked up and said, ‘What’s up, Dev?’ And then it was—it felt normal, like normal Ben.”
Guffey, another old friend, says Ben is on his mind constantly. “I found myself a lot of times waking up this fall and being like, ‘I don’t wanna go to class, I don’t wanna go to practice, I’m tired,’ but I know that Ben would get up and go to class, Ben would love to get up to go to practice.”
After all, he reflects, “I know Ben did not plan on that day in September being his last day of walking.”
“You know,” he adds after a pause. “For a while.”
Like most of those close to Ben, Guffey approaches discussion of the future tentatively. Perhaps because Ben’s plans are so ambitious–in typical Badgercrombie fashion. He is committed to a full recovery, which means walking. “I don’t want to sit in this chair for the rest of my life.”
After all: “I really have nothing else to do.”
 The odds are not in his favor. Dr. Ziv M. Williams, a professor in neurosurgery at Harvard Medical School, says that, “in cases where somebody does have a severe injury and they are still paralyzed within 48 to 72 hours after an injury, the chances of natural, spontaneous recovery is relatively low.” With an injury like Ben’s, “it’s relatively rare for them to regain function if they’re completely paralyzed.”
Marty, too, acknowledges that Ben’s chances of full mobility are statistically slim. “There’s no guarantee that he’ll get to that point,” he says. But he and Sherri are doggedly committed to providing him with the best chance for full recovery. “We’re gonna leave no stone unturned to figure out how we get there,” he says.
When Ben was still hospitalized, they spent practically all hours by his side. To pass the time, they researched every avenue of potential care they could find.
Even with a nurse in the home at all times, Marty sleeps next to his son every night. (“Sometimes he says my snoring is loud.”) And they’ve now completely reconfigured their lives to provide him with constant attention.
The rest of Hoover, too, is invested in Ben’s recovery.
 Lippy reports that she handpicked Ben’s therapists at Spain Rehab Center and drops by the house sometimes to give him extra therapy. A local construction company offered to reconfigure the basement into a living space for Ben. Sherri’s neighbor’s sorority sister’s late husband’s old company, which is located in Florida, provided a residential elevator. And then there are the Hoover connections that led to the electric wheelchair, the MedVac flight to Atlanta, the fire pit, the twice-weekly home-cooked meal deliveries… A head-spinning network of support touches every aspect of Ben’s life.
The Abercrombies, in turn, hope Ben’s story can affect others. Marty believes people who follow his son’s recovery might be able to “reevaluate what’s really important in life without having to go through the traumatic situation that we’ve had to go through.”
His story has captured the sympathy of high-profile football figures like University of Alabama coach Nick Saban and NFL star Julio Jones, and back at Harvard, the entire athletic department is backing Ben in his fight. In December, the football team organized a fundraiser at a local restaurant to help raise money for The Benson M. Abercrombie ‘21 fund, which brought in almost $30,000. The Harvard Varsity Club established the fund to support Ben and future severely injured Harvard athletes.
“It’s pretty breathtaking,” Ben says, reflecting on the support.
If Ben makes it back to Cambridge, administrators say they are thrilled to welcome him.
“The exciting thing about Harvard is that we have the resources to be able to support him if he does want to come back,” Waddell, his resident dean, says. “We have accessible rooms, we have the resources to support him in any way that he would need support if he wants to come back.”
For now, such considerations are a ways off. Mostly, the Abercrombies are optimistic about Ben’s recovery and warm toward his supporters. But not a day goes by that they don’t feel Ben’s pain.
“I would give anything for it to be me in Ben’s place rather than him,” Marty says.
And he has a practical concern: “Obviously, life is busy, people go on with their lives.” He worries about the staying power of Ben’s story. “It’s our hope that he won’t be forgotten.”
Meanwhile, Ben is focused on recovery. His diligence is borne of frustration–the acute frustration of existing in a body that once performed spectacular feats of athleticism, now capable of a few twitches of the arm on a good day.
“I can’t move, and, like, at night, my dad’s snoring keeps me up, and I can’t move to tell him to get up. And he doesn’t wake up if you yell at him, or anything. And my voice isn’t very loud anymore, ’cause it used to be really loud. Like I can’t move to tell him to shut up.”
He can talk, though, an improvement from his initial condition. For the first several weeks after the big hit, Ben couldn’t speak because of tubes running down his throat. During that time, he says, he thought a lot about his current position and his future. “I’d brainstorm what I wanted out of life.”
What does he want?
“A horse farm,” he says without hesitation.  “I definitely want to come back down south.” He and his old friend, Devin, want to work as financial managers for professional athletes. Ben will settle down and start a family.
And his kids–will they play football?
“Yeah, I think so. I think I’d let them play.” He pauses. “I’d definitely teach them the safety of it before.” A short, dry chuckle.
“But I think I’d let them play.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 28, 2018 at 2:45 a.m.
A University-wide task force on diversity and inclusion released its final report Tuesday, calling on central administrators to coordinate efforts across Harvard’s schools to “fully integrate all members of the University into academic, professional, and social contexts.”
The report, which is the final product of the 55-member Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, asks Harvard to “become its best self” through a framework of “Four Goals” and “Four Tools” and a set of eight concrete recommendations. It recommends the University enhance its mental health resources, improve recruitment and retention strategies for faculty, and establish pipeline programs for staff, among other measures.
“When students, staff, faculty members, or academic personnel are integrated into our community in ways that permit them to do their best work, we anticipate that they will experience a sense of full belonging,” the document reads.
The task force discussed “many dimensions of diversity,” according to the report, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, and ideology.
Its recommendations aim to achieve “mutually reinforcing” goals of inclusion and academic freedom, the report says, calling both of these ideals “core to Harvard’s mission.”
The final report is the second document the task force has released to the public. The group published a draft executive summary in Sept. 2017, after University President Drew G. Faust announced she would step down in the coming summer. Faust originally convened the task force in Sept. 2016—a year after a College working group called for its creation—and charged its members with evaluating Harvard’s demographics, institutional culture, academic resources, and existing organizational structures. Allen said the group wanted to release its recommendations before Faust’s departure.
In an email sharing the report with Harvard affiliates Tuesday, Faust wrote she is “deeply grateful for the extraordinary work of the task force and for the insightful, ambitious, and inspiring approaches reflected in its report.”
She also announced the appointment of John S. Wilson Jr. as a senior adviser and strategist to Harvard's president. Wilson, the president-in-residence at the Graduate School of Education and the former president of Morehouse College, will serve as a “point person” for the implementation of the report, Faust wrote.
Faust highlighted the parts of the report she will implement before leaving office, including designating $10 million in presidential funds to new faculty hires and requiring deans and administrators to produce plans to advance inclusion and belonging in their schools or units.
President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow will take over implementation of the recommendations when he moves into Massachusetts Hall this summer. Bacow, a member of the Harvard Corporation—the University’s highest governing body—served as the president of Tufts University from 2001 to 2011. While at Tufts, he worked to diversify the faculty and student body.
Faust wrote she has been “in consultation” with Bacow about the implementation of the report.
“Because I am nearing the end of my term as president, I want to ensure that the University’s leadership transition does not delay the implementation of the task force’s recommendations,” she wrote.
Faust wrote she and Bacow have designated items that can be acted upon immediately and others for “longer-term strategic work” that will fall under Bacow’s purview.
After it released the draft executive summary in September, the task force—led by Government Professor Danielle S. Allen, Kennedy School professor Archon Fung, and Vice President for Campus Services Meredith L. Weenick ’90—conducted outreach to gather feedback from Harvard affiliates.
According to Weenick, the task force met with stakeholders across all of Harvard’s schools—including student groups, deans, and staff—throughout the fall to discuss the draft. The group also created an online "Solution Space" for Harvard affiliates to submit comments or suggestions to the task force that other users could support by voting.
“It was an extraordinary process of collective discussion and deliberation, and so I know that the final report is much stronger because the campus engaged with the discussion draft so thoroughly,” Allen said.
The final iteration of the report still contains many of the recommendations in its draft version, including its first recommendation, which focuses on evaluating the University’s symbols, revising its values statement and alma mater, and creating inclusive spaces.
The report specifically mentions the Smith Campus Center as a space that, in addition to containing administrative offices and health services, should also serve as “a center for programming that supports civil disagreement and productive engagement with one another.”
In her email Tuesday, Faust called the Smith Campus Center a “centerpiece” of efforts to promote interaction across groups at the University.
“It is designed to be a crossroads, a central place for members of the community to gather, and it offers us the opportunity to embody a number of the task force recommendations in its identity from the outset,” she wrote. “I have asked that its art reflect the heterogeneity of today’s Harvard.”
Like the earlier draft, the final task force report emphasizes staff inclusion—particularly in a recommendation calling for University Human Resources to “enable staff talent and improve organizational culture.”
“Such efforts might involve offering services and training to managers directed toward moving more job candidates from underrepresented groups from finalist to appointee, and on the development of diverse teams,” the report reads.
Weenick said staff across groups raised common concerns about “interpersonal relations” in the workplace.
“We discovered through our listening that staff also experience some of the most extreme feelings of not belonging here, so it feels like we have further to go in some respects with the staff,” Weenick said.
The task force also reiterated in the final report a goal of encouraging “responsive curricula” that adapt to student demand by establishing new courses, hiring new faculty, and integrating student input into the process of crafting syllabi.
The task force recommended that the University collaborate with Harvard’s governing boards to increase funding for faculty renewal, cluster hiring processes, and pipeline programs for graduate students to develop into future faculty members.
Thirty-four percent of the University’s faculty are female overall, and 18 percent are minorities. But faculty demographics are very “school-specific,” Allen said, and some schools struggle to recruit both groups.
The Business School, for example, has increased its percentage of minority faculty by just two percentage points over a decade—rising from five percent in 2006 to seven percent in 2016, according to the report. The Kennedy School reported an increase from seven percent to 10 percent, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reported an increase from five to seven percent, and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences reported an increase from one to five percent.
A similarly slow growth rate exists in the percentage of female faculty in these three schools, among others. The Kennedy School reported an increase from 27 percent in 2006 to 31 percent in 2016, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences reported an increase from 35 percent to 37 percent, and the Business School from 22 percent to 26 percent, according to the report.
“If we look at women, you see meaningful growth in many places but not much growth in other places,” Allen said.
The Law School has reported relatively swifter growth in its percentage of female faculty across the last decade—rising from 24 percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 2016.
Though the University has become more diverse overall in the past decade, the task force report calls progress “frustratingly uneven” across schools—and asserts many issues of inclusion and belonging previously remained “unaddressed.” In addition to the “school-specific” discrepancies in recruitment and promotion of diverse faculty, the report also raised issues surrounding interpersonal relations and the culture of the University.
“There are structural aspects of our institution that have come to connect with cultural norms that we believe merit re-examination,” the document reads. “We suggest that leadership and new norms will be required to ensure that necessary hierarchies are nonetheless linked to a broad and deep culture of respect for all.”
The task force went on to describe how, in outreach sessions, Harvard affiliates voiced concerns about the existence of what they called a “Harvard code.”
“[They] said that encounters with tacit social norms are often experienced as privileging particular identities—typically white, male, secular, and politically liberal,” the report says.
The task force also recommended that Harvard build two University-wide centers designed by faculty, with one center focusing on “identity, politics, and culture” and the second on “higher education, inclusion and belonging, and organizational change.”
Advocates for ethnic studies at the College criticized the September draft executive summary, raising concerns that the draft did not explicitly call for an ethnic studies program or center, which advocates have requested for decades. In their most recent effort, the Ethnic Studies Coalition petitioned the University to create such a center and increase faculty hiring and renewal in the field.
Ethnic Studies Coalition founder Juhwan Seo ’17 in November posted about the omission of an explicit ethnic studies center or program on the task force's online solution space, creating a petition for a University-wide research center focusing on race and ethnicity that would serve as a “national hub” for ethnic studies. The petition quickly became the site’s most popular, garnering over 500 votes.
Seo’s petition mentioned Yale, Columbia, and Stanford—three peer institutions with centers concentrating on race and ethnicity—as points of comparison.
Allen said a task force subcommittee looked at comparable centers at peer institutions and worked to gain an understanding of “curricular gaps and absences” within Harvard’s program.
But the task force ultimately decided the centers should be formalized by “pulling a group of faculty together to be engaged in the design process,” Allen said.
“We wanted to make sure that all the intellectual developments of the last few decades could flow into how people think about the work they want to do in this context,” Allen said. “So, we didn’t want to presume an intellectual paradigm—for example, Ethnic Studies.”
Allen said the driving idea behind the centers is to create a base for inclusion and belonging work that covers many goals in the task force’s report.
“The notion is that curricular work flows from that, and work that supports student engagement in the associated academic fields flows from that, and faculty collaboration in these academic fields flows from that, and intellectual communities that can support recruitment and retention of faculty members flows from that—all four of those things,” she said.
The final report expands upon its draft version by introducing a new proposal for enhanced mental health services. The report recommends structural and organizational changes in the allocation of mental health resources to make them more accessible to students across the University.
“The Task Force recommends that CAMHS receive appropriate resources to conduct this strategic planning effectively and that the Office of Institutional Research be equipped to continue the mental health and well-being surveys across campus in a systematic way,” the document reads.
Allen said mental health resources at the University emerged as a key topic of concern during multiple outreach sessions the task force conducted after publishing the draft.
“Right now, that interface appears to be working less well than it might, and it appears to be also having kind of disparate impacts on different groups of students,” she said.
The final report places emphasized political ideology as an axis of diversity—one essential to “academic freedom.”
During their outreach sessions, task force members heard Harvard affiliates describe feeling excluded on the basis of their conservative political views, according to the report. The task force found that conflicts involving academic freedom can often “generate sharp disagreement” on campus.
“We heard a clear theme that many conservative students on campus engage in self-censorship to avoid possible alienation from peer groups,” the document reads. “We cannot afford to presume a necessary conflict between protecting academic freedom and a culture of mutual respect.”
While ideological diversity had been a recurring theme in the task force’s meetings since the group’s inception, Allen said the emphasis on free speech and academic freedom “got somewhat reduced” in the draft version released to Harvard affiliates.
“One of the things that happened is yes, the discussion draft brought to the surface a way in which a theme that had been there hadn’t gotten as much air time in that discussion draft as we thought it had and that we needed to respond to it more fully,” Allen said.
The task force’s remarks on academic freedom and ideological diversity come amid nationwide debate about free speech on university campuses.
“It’s across higher education we are all wrestling with issues with the relationship between speech and mutual respect. It is just a core issue on campuses at the moment and so it was important that we think our way through that question,” Allen said.
The debate has manifested at Harvard in recent months through controversial speakers like Jackie Hill-Perry, an “ex-gay” and outspoken critic of homosexuality who was invited to speak by Harvard College Faith and Action. During Hill-Perry’s visit, protesters gathered in the back of the hall holding signs in silent protest.
In an interview, Allen also touched on another issue igniting controversy across the country: sexual harassment. The national #MeToo movement has raised awareness about sexual harassment in offices, movie studios, newsrooms, and universities—including Harvard.
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences placed Government professor Jorge I. Dominguez on “administrative leave” earlier this month after The Chronicle of Higher Education reported that 18 women have accused Dominguez of sexual harassment over the past three decades.
Though the task force report does not explicitly mention sexual harassment, Allen said parts of the report are relevant to the dynamics underlying sexual misconduct and sexual assault at the University.
“Many people will read this report and think it is not relevant to issues of sexual assault and sexual misconduct and that I think is a deep misunderstanding of the problem involved with sexual assault and sexual misconduct, especially in sort of teacher-student relationships or supervisor-employee relationships,” she said.
Allen pointed to a section of the report outlining a goal for “improved mentoring.” The report asserts there should be “effective training for staff, faculty, and academic personnel” in mentoring relationships.
“Mentoring is such an important part of anybody’s academic or professional development and that depends on sort of healthy relational habits and practices and sexual misconduct and harassment often grow out of unhealthy, underlying relational practices,” Allen said.
Allen said that mentoring, in conjunction with the University’s Title IX policies, is integral to addressing sexual misconduct.
“You need really sturdy procedures for people to make grievances and for there to be responses to grievances and so forth. That point, I do think, our Title IX policies on this campus are a work in progress. Our report does not directly address Title IX, but it is obviously a critical piece of this,” Allen said.
As for the report’s implementation, Allen said she expects there will be “pretty smooth implementation hand-off” between Faust and Bacow once Bacow becomes Harvard’s 29th president.
In order to measure progress moving forward, the report lays out recommendations for improving data collection on diversity and inclusion metrics across schools. Allen said institutional research on these topics, as it stands now, is a “pretty fragmented enterprise.”
“Too often, efforts at diversity, inclusion, and belonging lead to well-intentioned but nonstrategic and uncoordinated ad hoc effects,” the document reads. “The result is ‘diversity clutter’: a host of programs that do not add up to more than the sum of their parts.”
The report also recommends the addition of an “inclusion and belonging module to the faculty climate survey, the staff engagement survey, and student exit surveys at each School.” This survey would be standardized across the University to provide a basis for gathering data about inclusion and belonging, according to Allen.
“What that will permit is it will give us a stronger basis for having that whole campus picture,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Kennedy School has received a $2.5 million gift to support research and programming on inequality and wealth concentration.
The James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Foundation donated these funds to the Kennedy School, according to a press release Tuesday. The funds will contribute to the Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy at the Kennedy School’s Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy.
“To make our economic system fairer, we will need to adopt policies that empower people who have been disadvantaged in economic or social terms to get a fair chance to succeed,” Dean of the Kennedy School Douglas W. Elmendorf said in the press release. “Jim and Cathy Stone’s generosity will allow the Kennedy School to enhance its work on these crucial issues in the years ahead.”
James M. Stone ’69 is the founder and CEO of the Plymouth Rock Assurance Corporation, a group of insurance companies based in the northeast. In addition to graduating from the College in 1969, he obtained a Masters Degree in Economics from in 1970 and a PhD in Economics from Harvard in 1973. His wife, Cathleen D. Stone, is the president of their foundation and sits on the boards of multiple organizations.
The gift will fund eight doctoral students per year across the University’s graduate schools. The donation will also fund the Stone Senior Scholars program—an initiative which will invite 12 leading scholars of inequality to give lectures and coordinate events about economic opportunity and income inequality—and the James M. and Cathleen D. Stone Lecture, a series of public lectures around economic inequality across the world.
French economist Thomas Piketty will deliver the first lecture of the Stone series Friday at the Kennedy School’s JFK Forum.
This is the not the first contribution the foundation has made to research on economic equality. In 2016, the foundation announced it would donate $2.5 million to the Graduate Center of the City University of New York to fund a center for work surrounding economic inequality.
“The concentration and sequestration of wealth at the top can interfere with economic growth and diminish the benefits of mobility,” James Stone said in the press release. “Excesses of concentration and hereditary wealth tend to weaken the middle class and dampen prospects for the poor. Just as important, this trend threatens to undermine the democratic pluralism in politics that has helped create this country’s impressive record of success.”
The donation from the foundation comes as Harvard nears the completion of its record-setting capital campaign, set to end in June 2018. The Kennedy School had raised more than $660 million as of February 2018, surpassing its original $500 million goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council unanimously adopted a policy order supporting the Temporary Protected Status visa program at a meeting Monday.
The TPS program, which Congress established in 1990, grants temporary protections to immigrants from countries experiencing natural disasters or armed conflicts, allowing them to legally live and work in the United States. The Trump administration recently announced plans to revoke TPS for immigrants from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Haiti, and Sudan. Protections for immigrants from Honduras, Yemen, Somalia, and Nepal will end later this year.
Following the release of new federal immigration policies, 19 state attorneys general endorsed a letter urging Congress to grant permanent legal status to immigrants at risk of losing TPS.
The City Council’s policy order—which all nine councillors approved—asserts the city’s support for the letter to Congress, noting that the City of Cambridge has long been “a proud supporter of immigrants.”
In an interview, Manny E. Lusardi, the mayor’s liaison for immigrant affairs, pointed to Cambridge’s history of immigrant-supporting policies, which include free monthly legal consultations for immigrants and the city’s immigration legal defense fund.
Lusardi, who wrote the order, emphasized the importance of these local programs in the face of federal policies targeting immigrants.
“Immigration is local,” he said. “We’re trying to prove that by leading other people in the community and asking them, by example, to step up to do similar programs.”
Mayor Marc C. McGovern, who sponsored the order, said the legislation was an important step towards protecting immigrants in Cambridge.
“I think it’s just another example of our stating our values, and pushing back against the presidential administration we feel is attacking immigrants in our community,” McGovern said.
McGovern also called for the city to surpass its previous commitments to immigrants, saying he thought anti-immigrant sentiment still exists in Massachusetts, despite its “blue” tilt.
“Cambridge has been a sanctuary city since the mid-80s. Crime is at a 60-year low,” he said. “It is not undocumented immigrants that are committing crimes in Cambridge, but folks don’t want to believe the data. There’s so much prejudice and racism, even here in Massachusetts.”
At the meeting, Councillor Quinton Zondervan voiced concerns about  TPS recipients losing their driver’s licenses. According to immigrant advocacy groups, TPS immigrants without licenses will be vulnerable to arrest, since driving after they lose their protected status is prohibited.
“I’m particularly concerned, in this case, because we are changing our driver’s license requirements, which will severely impact immigrants who are losing their Temporary Protected Status,” Zondervan said.
According to McGovern, while Monday’s policy order does not address specific policy issues, it does have “symbolic” value.
“I want people to have a path towards citizenship that is reasonable that doesn’t take years and years,” he said. “I’d like to see them become citizens. They basically are.”

Harvard announced an immediate revision to the last line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s 181-year old alma mater, in a Harvard-wide task force report on diversity and inclusion released Tuesday morning.
The lyrics, which previously read “till the stock of the Puritans die,” will now read “till the stars in the firmament die.” “Fair Harvard,” written in 1836, has only been altered once before in its history. In 1998, the word “sons” was replaced with the word “we” to address concerns of gender inclusivity.
Last April, Danielle S. Allen, co-chair of the University task force on inclusion and belonging, announced Harvard would hold a competition to select new lyrics for the final line of the song.
“The Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging launched this competition to affirm that Harvard’s motto, Veritas, speaks to and on behalf of all members of our community, regardless of background, identity, religious affiliation, or viewpoint,” the task force’s website reads.
The new line, submitted by Janet B. Pascal ’84, was selected from among 168 entries for the task force’s competition by a committee of five judges, among them Kurt Crowley, the associate conductor of Broadway musical “Hamilton.”
“I wanted something that had as much the same rhythm and vowels as possible, so it would sound the same, and the same kind of formal and flowery diction, so firmament just seemed like the perfect word,” Pascal said.
After months of work, the diversity task force on Tuesday debuted the final version of its University-wide report (which included the revisions to the alma mater). The report detailed eight key recommendations, one of which called for “Inclusive Values, Symbols, and Spaces.”
“The alma mater revision is a key part of that,” Allen said in an interview last week.
Pascal said she thinks the alteration to the alma mater means the song better reflects the perspectives of all Harvard affiliates.
“I think it’s a very good thing that Harvard was actually thinking about it enough to decide to change what is a line too firmly focused on one small group, so I’m glad they did,” Pascal said.
In an email response to the release of the report Tuesday, University President Drew G. Faust also referenced her desire to make symbols at Harvard more inclusive.
“The task force recommendations on inclusive symbols and spaces obviously extend well beyond the Smith Center, and I have asked the executive vice president and the deans to develop additional guidelines and policies designed to improve wayfinding on campus and to ensure that public art on campus reflects our commitment to belonging and inclusion, ” Faust wrote in the email.
The revision to the alma mater is one of multiple changes to Harvard symbols in recent years. In 2016, the Corporation approved the removal of a seal at the Law School after outcry from students.
The former seal featured the crest of a slaveholding family that contributed to the endowment of Harvard’s first law professorship more than two centuries ago.
“When it comes time to sing our alma mater, updated at the suggestion of the task force, I will proudly give voice to the song’s new final line—and its recognition that the pursuit of truth and knowledge belongs to everyone at Harvard, from all backgrounds and beliefs,” Faust wrote in her email.

Harvard plans to invest an expected $300 million in a direct lending firm started by three former Harvard Management Company credit specialists, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.
The money will come from Harvard’s endowment; the Boston firm slated to receive the millions dollar-strong backing from the University is Evolution Credit Partners, according to Bloomberg.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment Tuesday on the expected investment.
Evolution Credit, which finances buyouts, acquisitions, growth capital, and recapitalizations, among other services, also provides direct financing to private middle market companies in the U.S. with earnings between $15 million to $100 million, according to the firm’s website.
All three co-founders of Evolution Credit have strong ties to HMC. One of the co-founders, Rene Canezin, previously served as the head of fixed income, credit, and commodities at HMC. Mike Guarnieri, another co-founder and now a managing partner at the firm, worked as a specialist in private credit business at HMC. Joe Lu, managing director and partner at Evolution Credit, is also a former employee of HMC, where he specialized in private credit business.
Valued at $37.1 billion, Harvard’s endowment is the largest university endowment in the world. The endowment has underperformed in recent years; now, new HMC CEO N.P. “Narv” Narvekar is implementing ambitious changes to its management structure in an effort to reverse this trend.
Last January, Narvekar announced plans to cut HMC’s 230-person staff by over half. Narvekar has cut around 100 jobs since he joined HMC in late 2016.
In another change, HMC’s real estate team officially became part of Boston-based private equity firm Bain Capital in February, finalizing a decision made late last year.

Professors and curators at the Harvard Semitic Museum are developing an app to allow museum visitors to experience the Great Sphinx at Giza in 3-D augmented reality.
The app allows viewers to engage with a physical reproduction of Thutmose IV’s “Dream Stela,” which sits between the legs of the Sphinx at Giza, by providing translations and explanations of the hieroglyphic texts as well as virtual representations of the Sphinx over time. In order to view these features, visitors point their phone cameras at the stela and line up an outline with the artifact.
Egyptology Professor Peter Der Manuelian '81, who teaches Societies of the World 38: “Pyramid Schemes,” is spearheading the project.  Manuelian called the project a “way to be sort of a virtual tourist at the site of the Giza Pyramids.”
Thutmose IV constructed the "Dream Stela" during the 18th Egyptian dynasty, though the Sphinx itself was built much earlier, during the fourth dynasty. Semitic Museum visitors can use the app to experience in 360 degrees how the Sphinx looked originally, how it appeared after the stela’s construction 1,100 years later, and how the monument looks to visitors today.
In an interview, “Pyramid Schemes” Teaching Fellow Lauren M. Santini explained the history of the monument.
“The stela says that Thutmose IV had a dream that the Sphinx came to him and said, if you uncover me of sand you will be made pharaoh. So he uncovered the sphinx, he became pharaoh,” Santini said.
Manuelian said the app is “not quite ready for prime time,” and brought in students from his class to test it out this week.
Students said they enjoyed using the app and its ability to enhance their understanding of the monument.
“I think it definitely adds to your experience, because you can still go the museum the normal way, but then you also have the potential to augment reality in this way,” said Aaron Grand ’18.
Jessica Gebhard '20 said she appreciated seeing how the “coloring” and “structure” of the monument has changed over time through the app.
“I like that you can see the different time periods in the background, with how the Sphinx looked with the stela in front of it and without,” Gebhard said.
Casper Dehnavi ‘20 also mentioned that the app helped explain the images on the stela.
“It was nice that there were descriptions of what the images were,” Dehvani said. “Who everybody was, and which images of gods were represented.”
Nonetheless, the beta app, which is not yet publicly available, is not without a few glitches.  Many of the students said they encountered difficulties getting the app to recognize the stela.
Looking ahead, Gebhard said “getting it up and running on different platforms,” like Android, would help improve visitors’ experiences.
Many students and faculty, though, were optimistic about the new opportunities to interact with exhibits that apps like this one could provide.
“Having this sort of engagement with technology, it feels a little more special and a little more intimate,” said Santini.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of about 30 students, Harvard union affiliates, and others crowded the sidewalk outside the Smith Campus Center Tuesday evening to protest the termination of former University Health Services employee Mayli Shing.
The picket marked the second demonstration in support of Shing since she was fired on Feb. 6 and is part of an ongoing campaign calling on the University to rehire her. As she did during the last picket, Shing claimed she was fired in retaliation after she made allegations of workplace racism and sexual harassment.
According to her termination letter, Shing was fired because of “insubordinate conduct in repeatedly disregarding instructions.” The letter specifically cites an incident in which Shing arrived at work 30 minutes before her shift began on Feb. 6, despite having been warned not to do so.
Geoffrey Carens, Shing’s union representative from the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, said two of Shing’s work evaluations, though, commended her for arriving before her regular hours. Carens said the evaluations called her “extremely reliable.”
“It shows how incredibly arbitrary this whole situation was,” Carens said.
At the picket, Shing’s supporters marched in circles, chanting statements like “Survivors deserve justice,” and “No racism at Harvard.” Carens and other organizers distributed noisemakers and signs, and a few crowd members, including Shing herself, gave short speeches.
The Harvard No Layoffs Campaign—a caucus of HUCTW members and allies—and the Student Labor Action Movement, a pro-labor undergraduate advocacy group, jointly organized both pickets.
Since the first event, two new groups have decided to endorse their efforts: the Transgender Task Force, a student group dedicated to supporting transgender people and allies, and Our Harvard Can Do Better, a student group focused on combating sexual assault on campus.
“This is a group of people who are passionate and committed to seeing this through and making sure that Mayli gets rehired,” said Graduate School of Arts and Sciences student Andrew Keefe.
Lauren G. Fadiman ’21, a representative of SLAM, said in a speech to the crowd that she hoped the protest would have a broader effect on how Harvard workers are treated.
“Hopefully with a lot of work and a lot of shouting today on the street we can really see change in Mayli’s circumstances but also a change in Harvard’s workplace culture overall,” Fadiman said.
University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga did not offer comment beyond an earlier emailed statement after the first protest in February.
“As a matter of policy, we do not comment on individual personnel matters, but all complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment are investigated thoroughly and fairly,” deLuzuriaga wrote in February. “Harvard is committed to maintaining a safe, comfortable, and diverse working environment for all of its employees.”
In a speech at the conclusion of the picket, Carens said the groups plan to continue protesting until they achieve their goal to “get justice for Mayli.”
As they left the scene, demonstrators chanted in unison, “We’ll be back, we’ll be back.”

UPDATED: March 31, 2018 at 7:00 p.m.
Harvard faculty members, students, and workers, as well as affiliates of other Boston-area universities braved brisk winds to protest in support of immigration rights outside the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston Tuesday afternoon.
A mix of Harvard professors and faculty at other local universities worked to organize the event, which included a variety speakers from across the Boston area who ranged from educators to union leaders. Organizers gathered a list of demands from protesters at the end of the event to pass along to Massachusetts senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey. The organizers said they chose to assemble in front of the building during the workday because of the building’s ties to immigration policy.
“The point of that is that we wanted to be there during working hours in the federal building where USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] is located and where Immigration Court is located,” said organizer and Divinity School professor Ahmed Ragab.
The protest follows a September demonstration in which professors blocked traffic on Massachusetts Avenue in an act of civil disobedience to protest Trump administration immigration policies. More than 30 professors from Harvard and other universities were arrested. Since the protest, Ragab said he and other organizers have kept an email listserv, which approximately 70 professors have used to plan other immigration advocacy events, including the Tuesday protest.
In particular, protesters advocated for protections for residents covered by the now-endangered Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Temporary Protected Status programs.  Trump rescinded DACA—an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States—in early September. Trump originally set a March 5 deadline for Congress to pass permanent protections for undocumented youth, though federal judges since then have ruled the Department of Homeland Security must continue to renew existing DACA permits. Still, the department is not accepting new DACA applications—and without a legislative solution, the future for current DACA recipients remains uncertain.
The Trump administration also recently chose to end the Temporary Protected Status program for immigrants from Haiti and El Salvador, among many other countries, affecting thousands of immigrants across the nation and dozens of Harvard affiliates.
Organizer and History of Science Professor Sophia Roosth, who participated in a sign-making session hosted by the organizers earlier Tuesday afternoon, said it was important they hold a protest now to “keep the momentum going.”
“We feel that after March 5, there’s been a lot of inattention to what’s going on, and we’re concerned that that’s going to lead to people becoming a bit complacent,” Roosth said. “It’s important even as time continues to draw attention to this really important matter so that it’s not forgotten.”
History Professor Kirsten A. Weld, who spoke at the protest, said she teaches undocumented students in some of her classes and thinks about what her classroom would look like without those students.
“I think their absence would impoverish our community not just for the students who would be deprived of an education, but for all of the other students who could learn from them and could learn from their experiences,” Weld said in an interview after the protest.
Weld added that she thinks she has a responsibility to support her students and show them their professors care about the struggles they’re going through.
“When our students are treated unjustly, our professors are going to stand up and say, ‘This is unacceptable,’” Weld said.
Weld was one of the professors arrested in the September demonstration.
Holding a sign that read “No human being is illegal,” Divinity School student Kat G. Poje said she wants to create an environment where people can learn without the fear of being taken away from their homes.
“This is a way of saying we, as those especially involved in education in the greater Boston area, are against this,” Poje said.
Doris Reina-Landaverde, a Harvard custodial staff member from El Salvador, was one of the speakers at the protest and said she fears for her future employment if her TPS status is revoked.
Her daughter, Virginia Landaverde, a middle school student, also voiced concerns about her family situation during a speech at the protest.
“This is kind of my dream college because my parents work here, so I kind of grew up running around the halls of the Science Center,” Landaverde said of Harvard. “I’ve always wanted to go there, and it’s hard, because I also have to think about other things.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 31, 2018
A previous version of this article incorrectly indicated that Divinity School student Kat G. Poje held a sign that read "No immigrant is illegal." In fact, the sign read "No human being is illegal."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 28, 2018 at 12:20 a.m.
The Office of Student Life chose not to renew a $50,000 grant largely dedicated to funding student group travel this year, leading to financial uncertainty for some campus organizations.
All student groups in good standing, as well as individual students traveling to academic conferences, were formerly eligible to apply for the travel grant, called “The Dean of Harvard College Student Life Fund.”  Administrators have also used the fund to support House Committees in the past.
According to Currier House Representative Amanda Flores ’20, the Office of Student Life never informed student organizations of the travel grant’s expiration. Some student groups had already spent money on travel this year under the expectation the fund would be renewed.
“The Office of Student Life didn’t do anything to tell groups that this would no longer be offered,” Flores said.
Associate Dean of Student Engagement Alex R. Miller wrote in an emailed statement that the program is currently under review.
“The Office of Student Life travel grant fund... has been successful in many areas, [but] there have also been unfortunate instances in which funding was misused,” Miller wrote. “This has caused us to take a thoughtful, yet thorough review of the process for allocation and distribution of the grant, which is currently underway.”
Office of Student Life spokesperson Aaron Goldman did not directly respond to a question asking about the specific incidents that led to the decision to review the fund.
Before the fund’s cancellation this year, student leaders and College officials jointly administered the money. According to the most recent guidelines posted on the Office of Student Life website, those guiding the fund prioritized travel “aligned with the College’s mission to support experiences that foster intellectual, social, and personal transformation.”
Harvard has offered this fund since at least 2013, though in that year the grant totaled only $20,000. In 2014, the College agreed to offer an additional $30,000 for domestic student group travel in response to recommendations issued by a working group. The working group formed that same year after an undergraduate died in a car crash while returning to campus from a mock trial competition.
The Undergraduate Council failed to pass legislation at its Sunday meeting to provide $6,000 in reimbursements for student groups that had already spent money on travel. At the meeting, some representatives said they were concerned allocating UC funds for student group travel could render the Council liable to legal threats should students experience accidents while traveling on the UC’s dime.
Flores, a member of the cheerleading club who co-sponsored the legislation, said Sunday the cut in travel funding could force her club to make budget cuts.
“We usually get about $2,000 to help us pay for nationals, so you know, that’s a big chunk of our budget missing,” Flores said.  “Probably we won’t be able to do stuff in the future because of that.”
In recommending adding more money to the travel fund in 2014, the working group wrote they worried student groups’ desire to avoid high travel costs could  jeopardize undergraduates’ safety while traveling. Now, some undergraduates say the College’s cancellation of the travel fund means student groups will be forced to make exactly the kind of financial calculations the College sought to render unnecessary in 2014.
Kevin C. Fei ’19, treasurer of Harvard Ballroom, said the group wanted to travel by bus to a recent competition, but was unable to do so without the travel grant.
“We had to rent a bunch of cars, which is less safe and less desirable for everyone,” Fei said.
UC Treasurer Nadine M. Khoury ’20, who also co-sponsored the failed legislation, said “multiple” students have approached her asking about the termination of the travel fund.
“There are many people that are personally in debt,” Khoury said. “This is a really big thing for financial accessibility for people who just cannot afford to go on these trips.”
In an interview Monday, Khoury said the Finance Committee usually helps to publicize the existence of the fund to student groups in November after receiving word from the Office of Student Life. This year, though, the committee did not hear anything about the fund from the office, according to Khoury.
Multiple members of the UC Executive Committee declared their intention to push the Office of Student Life  to reinstate funding for the travel grant.
“I advocated at every meeting I could to bring back the grant because I think it’s very important to student life,” UC Vice President Nicholas D. Boucher ’19 said.
College spokesperson Goldman did not directly respond to a question asking whether Harvard plans to renew the travel grant in the future.
“The College recognizes the importance of a thriving student organization community,” Miller wrote.  “We hope that students will take part in student organization travel activities that are safe and aligned with University policies.”
“We look forward to providing an update on the status of the funds in the near future,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Lowell House Faculty Deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin will step down at the end of the 2018-2019 academic year, the two wrote in an email to House affiliates Wednesday.
This spring, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will bring together a committee of students, staff, and members of Lowell’s senior common room to select the new faculty deans, Eck and Austin wrote. The committee will choose new faculty deans before the start of the next academic year.
Eck and Austin wrote they want the new faculty deans to adjust to leading the house during the final year of Lowell’s renovation. Lowell—the fifth of Harvard’s 12 undergraduate residential houses to be renewed—is currently in its first of two years of renovations.
“We think it is important for the incoming faculty deans to be appointed in a timely fashion, to familiarize themselves with the scope and facilities of the new Lowell House, and to make many of the important upcoming decisions,” they wrote.
In an email sent to students Wednesday morning, Khurana wrote Eck and Austin plan to “work closely” with the committee charged with picking their successors.
“We are so sorry to see them move on, and are deeply grateful for their dedication to Harvard College over the years,” he wrote.
Eck and Austin’s decision to step down comes after 20 years as Lowell faculty deans. In the email, they described their stint as faculty deans as “the happiest and most rewarding time of our lives together at Harvard.”
“We do plan to be here to see the House through this next year of our diaspora and there will be time in the year ahead to say just how much we love the Lowell House community,” the two wrote.
News of Eck and Austin’s upcoming departure from Lowell comes at a time of turnover for the leadership of some Houses. Last week, Khurana announced that Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Professor Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras would serve as faculty deans for Leverett House starting next year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kathryn “Kat” A. Taylor ’80, a member of the Board of Overseers—the second highest governing body of the University— publicly called for Harvard to divest from fossil fuels Wednesday afternoon, marking the first time any member of Harvard’s governance boards have called for divestment.
Taylor is the co-founder and CEO of Beneficial State Bank, a California-based community development bank. She was elected to the Board of Overseers by Harvard alumni in 2012, and her term will end later this year.
In an op-ed published by The Crimson on Wednesday, Taylor called for University President-elect Lawrence S. Bacow and Harvard Management Company—the investment branch in charge of the University’s $37.1 billion endowment—to “adopt ethical investment principles.”
“At a minimum, Harvard should direct the Harvard Management Company to divest from fossils fuels to prevent the end of life as we know it through cascading climate-driven disasters,” Taylor wrote. “This single act would not only take steps to address the existential crisis of our time, but it would allow the University to lead its peers, as few, if any, American universities thus far have taken this important moral stance.”
<<<<QUOTES FROM CALL>>>>
The University has faced consistent pressure in recent years from faculty and students alike to divest from fossil fuels.
More than 100 Harvard faculty signed an open letter in April 2014, urging University President Drew G. Faust and the Corporation to divest from fossil fuel investments. As of Wednesday, more than 270 have signed the letter. In March 2015, a group of 20 students stormed and occupied Massachusetts Hall— where Faust’s office space is located to demand fossil fuel divestment. And in March 2017, 20 members of the student activist group Divest Harvard blockaded University Hall to demand similar action.
Despite the mounting pressure, Faust has held firm on her stance on divesting from fossil fuels, arguing that Harvard can better tackle climate change through research.
“While I share their belief in the importance of addressing climate change, I do not believe, nor do my colleagues on the Corporation, that university divestment from the fossil fuel industry is warranted or wise,” Faust wrote in a letter to Harvard affiliates in 2013.
In an email sent to Harvard affiliates in January, Faust announced the University’s plans to be fossil-fuel free by 2050. However, Faust did not discuss the University’s stance on its fossil fuel investments at the time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend, the number 13 spelled bad luck for the Harvard women’s water polo team as it dropped a close game to the 13th-ranked Indiana Hoosiers.
Ranked No. 22 in the nation, the Crimson squad (13-11, 2-1 Ivy) traveled to the Stokes Natatorium in Pennsylvania to compete in the Red Flash Tournament. Building on the work put in during its California trip over break, Harvard showcased its offensive strength to defeat George Washington (10-8) and Saint Francis (12-9, 0-1 NEC) both by six-point  margins. The games came after the Crimson fell to No. 13 Indiana (20-5, 1-1 Big Ten) by only one goal.
“Overall this weekend was great for us,” junior Kristen Hong said. “Even though we were playing in a shallow-deep pool, the games this weekend allowed us to implement what we learned about each other's playing styles from our California trip.”
NO. 22 HARVARD 14, GEORGE WASHINGTON 8
In Sunday morning’s game against George Washington, the Colonials scored the initial two goals, finding the back of the net twice in the opening two minutes. However, Hong scored Harvard’s first goal of the morning match and the team quickly made up the deficit. By minute four, the Crimson led 4-2.
By halftime, the team still lead by two but had amassed eight points. In the second stanza of the game, Harvard continued to dominate. Goals by freshman Olivia Price, sophomore Mathilde Ribordy and captain Sami Strutner—coupled with strong defense—helped the Crimson extend its lead. Price dominated, racking up five goals by herself. Sophomore Angie Varona, freshman Jilly Cronin and sophomore Sofia Carrera-Justiz each recorded two steals.
Goalies captain Cleo Harrington and junior Sam Acker shared time in the net. The duo collaborated to block seven attempted shots, curtailing the George Washington offensive front en route to Harvard’s 14-8 victory.
NO. 22 HARVARD 13, SAINT FRANCIS 7
On Saturday evening, Harvard returned to the pool after a loss to Indiana in the morning. Beginning with a slow first period, Harvard scored five goals in the second quarter of the game to go into the halftime with a 7-5 lead.
In the third and fourth quarters, the Crimson continued to pick up momentum scoring three goals in each. Junior Haley Bowe and Hong led the final charge, both scoring two goals in the second half to lift Harvard over Saint Francis, 13-7.
Aker and Harrington swam in front of the net, each racking up a bevy of blocks. The captain knocked down three shots while Aker prevented six points.
NO. 13 INDIANA 11, NO. 22 HARVARD 10
Squaring up against Indiana, the Crimson displayed tenacity and teamwork, outscoring one of the top ranked teams in the country in the second half of the game. Unfortunately despite finding the back of the net eight times in the final 16 minutes, Harvard was unable to overcome its first half deficit to beat the Hoosiers.
“We lost to Indiana by one goal, but we have another shot at them in two weeks at Harvard so we're excited to face up again,” Strutner said. “It was a great battle though and we played well, so it hardly feels like a loss.”
Hong led the Crimson offense with three goals and was followed by Carrera-Justiz, Strutner and Price, each of whom netted two against the Hoosiers. Harvard’s game total of ten goals against Indiana marks the highest offensive output by the the Crimson against a higher ranked opponent this season.
The weekend’s Red Flash tournament may as well been a scouting match for Harvard as the team will get another chance at both Saint Francis and Indiana on Saturday.
“These were the final games before conference play, which are the ones that actually matter, so we had some good opportunities this past weekend to work on skills we wanted to fine tune,” Strutner said.

Sections
There they are. Your eyes lock across the crowded Cabot Aquarium, just as you swerve to keep from brushing against a sweaty football player’s bare back, nearly dropping your red Solo cup. You make your way to each other and exchange pleasantries. At this point, the party’s drawing to a close, so it’s time to head back and get down to business, right? Wrong. Harvard has been conspiring to keep you a virgin all along.
Tiny, flimsy beds
Unless you live in a luxurious single in the Quad, you’re probably forced to sleep in a narrow twin bed. It’s already small enough for one person, let alone two (or more, wink wink). And if it seems like Harvard gave you a ridiculously squeaky bed frame, chances are they did it purposefully.
Thin walls
There’s nothing worse than heading to the dhall for a hearty morning-after breakfast and having half of your House look at you knowingly. It also sucks to be on the other side of the paper-thin wall, when you can hear your suitemate’s every sound—although it is pretty fun to listen to their awkward pillow talk.
No privacy
You can never quite escape the prying eyes of that one roommate who insisted they move their bed into the common room. Plus, while other schools have RAs, Harvard decided to place actual adult tutors or proctors in every entryway, which can make for some awkward encounters.
The free condoms are a myth
Those condom dispensers in the bathrooms are forever empty. This means that you have to be optimistic about the night’s events and squeeze in a trip to CVS—where, again, you could run into pretty much anyone—at some point on Saturday afternoon.
The pickings are slim
Harvard provides us with a binary social scene: Everyone here is either a recluse or a narcissist, neither of which has much sex appeal. So, even if you’re able to overcome all the previous obstacles, you’re not guaranteed a caring, sexy partner to get it on with.
If we learned anything in Expos, it’s that evidence matters. And the evidence all points to an elaborate conspiracy on Harvard’s part. Don’t be surprised if there’s an email about this from Drew Faust herself in your inbox tomorrow morning.
