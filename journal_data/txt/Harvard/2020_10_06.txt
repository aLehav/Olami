Name one character from “Avatar.” Quickly.
No, not of the “Last Airbender” sort. Name a character from James Cameron’s 2009 film about blue aliens that is somehow such a culturally important movie that it has an entire Wikipedia page dedicated to the box office records it has set.
Despite the fact that “Avatar” held the record for the highest grossing movie ever for ten years (until “Avengers: Endgame” usurped its title), the film has never inspired the same devotion and familiarity as other important films of the 2000s. Commended for its elaborate use of special effects and technology, the praise for Avatar is mostly for its cinematic innovation, rather than its storytelling impact.
Besides the new themed area at Walt Disney World that opened in 2017, and that one time Cirque du Soleil made a Pandora-inspired show that ran from 2015-2019, the epic science-fiction film has stayed relatively outside of the cultural consciousness for the past decade. However, as the chaos of 2020 is nowhere near done with us yet, James Cameron himself has recently confirmed that “Avatar 2” has been entirely filmed, and “Avatar 3” is “95% complete.”
Wait, what?
Apparently, these movies have been in the making for quite some time. Four years before the first “Avatar” even came out, Cameron hoped that if the first movie was successful, he would end up making two sequels. Shortly after the original film hit one billion in box office earnings, a sequel was confirmed in Jan. 2010. By 2012, we were up to three sequels and, as of 2016, the writing team had enough material to reach even an “Avatar 5.”
The rest of the production process, however, has progressed at a significantly slower pace. The first of the sequels has had no less than eight distinct delays, the most recent of which being the global pandemic halting production this past March. However, since the movie was set to be filmed in New Zealand (one of the countries doing the best in the fight against COVID) years ago, the production crew was luckily able to resume filming back in May.
Live-action filming has recently wrapped, which Cameron confirmed on Sept. 22 at the 2020 Austrian World Summit, but the actual premise of the film will remain a mystery. Cameron refused to divulge details in the interview (which, by the way, was conducted by Arnold Schwarznegger) in the interest of maintaining the magic of the reveal. Though we don’t know specifics, we do know that much of the original cast will be returning, with Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana heading the charge and reprising their roles as Jake Sully and Neytiri, respectively. Also worth noting, Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang are returning as well — despite the deaths of their characters in the first film. Though Weaver will reportedly be playing an entirely new character, it is currently unclear how exactly Lang will fit into the sequel. Some new additions to the cast include Kate Winslet (marking her first collaboration with Cameron since “Titanic”), Vin Diesel (though it isn’t confirmed which exact sequels he will be in), and a slew of child actors (who all had to learn how to act underwater, since much of the sequel will feature the previously unexplored territory of Pandora’s waters).
If the current slate of intriguing updates is any indication, there’s truly no telling what exactly Cameron has in store for moviegoers. Though the progress made on the movie is promising, even if all goes well it will still be a while before audiences are able to return to Pandora. With a rumored budget of 250 million dollars, and a massive standard of visual effects to deliver, the current expected release date of “Avatar 2” is Dec. 16, 2022. The rest of the films will each be released two years apart, meaning that the conclusion (at least, before they add yet another sequel) to this epic adventure is set for 2028 — a full 19 years after the original film’s release.
We can only hope that, with such a long wait, the production team took the time to find a font other than Papyrus for the promotional materials.

It may still be 2020, but there are only three months left in this neverending year. As we all could use some escapism right now, here’s some nostalgia straight from the simpler time of 2010 — ten songs that turn ten years old this year.
1. “Monster” by Kanye West
This six-minute long, star-studded rap epic is undoubtedly some of Kanye’s best work. The melodic, haunting, and disturbing production combine with appearances from Jay-Z, Rick Ross, and Bon Iver to create this groundbreaking track. And of course, you can’t listen to this song without being absolutely floored by Nicki Minaj’s iconic verse — which the Village Voice referred to as the verse “that announced [her] manic brilliance to so many.”
2. “Moment 4 Life” by Nicki Minaj feat. Drake
Speaking of Nicki Minaj, her much-anticipated debut album “Pink Friday” (2010) brought with it “Moment 4 Life” featuring Drake. The lyrically poignant song deviates from Minaj’s typical subject matter to shout out the people who helped her get to where she is and to express the realization that she has begun to achieve her wildest dreams — but that this moment will, like all, eventually pass her by.
3. “Whip My Hair” by Willow Smith
When listening to Willow Smith’s unapologetic, explosive “Whip My Hair,” one must remember that Smith was only nine years old when she released her debut single. The song was insanely successful, reaching Platinum status and eventually climbing to number 11 on US Billboard Hot 100. Despite her youth, Smith’s vocal ability was so powerful that it garnered comparisons to Rihanna’s.
4. “S&M” by Rihanna
Speaking of Rihanna, I would be remiss if I failed to mention her iconic song “S&M.” The suggestive lyrics combined with its sultry, smooth production instantly made the song a hit. Rihanna resists subjugation and oppression in the song, presenting herself as a powerful and unapologetic woman with the ability to dominate both inside and outside of the bedroom.
5. “Telephone” by Lady Gaga feat. Beyoncé 
Lady Gaga’s “Telephone” is a song of techno-liberation (a theme she employs way ahead of its time) and resistance of patriarchal desires — Gaga denies a man’s calls, immersing herself in dance and music rather than succumbing to him as he pesters her through her telephone. Gaga originally wrote “Telephone” for Britney Spears, but listening to how her light yet forceful voice pairs well with Beyonce’s distinct timbre, it seems apt that these two icons were the ones to bring this song to the world.
6. “Wavin’ Flag (Coca-Cola Celebration Mix)” by K’Naan
Re-released when Coca-Cola chose the reggae-fusion track as their promotional anthem for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, this song resonated with countless fans due to its poignancy and beautiful simplicity. The inspirational track conveys K'naan's passion in an unrivaled manner, and the anthem spread beyond soccer fans to reach the top of the charts in many countries.
7. “TiK ToK” by Ke$ha
This Billboard Hot 100 #1 track was the anthem 13-year-olds would blast while preparing for the middle school dance. Kesha’s Auto-Tuned energy was contagious and immensely freeing. Time may “tik tok” away, but Kesha reminded us to enjoy our youth, put on some tops from Aeropostale, and dance the night away before our parents had to pick us up at 9:30 p.m.
8. “Last Of The American Girls” by Green Day
Green Day has been pumping out angsty, powerful rock music since 1987, and in 2010, they released “Last of the American Girls.” The song perfectly captures what it felt like for a young generation to live in the 21st century, and the band praised those who refused to “cooperate” with the “establishment corporation” in the years following the Great Recession.
9. “Love The Way You Lie” by Eminem feat. Rihanna 
Eminem and Rihanna’s raw single “Love the Way You Lie” was simultaneously lauded and criticized by reviewers for the way it tackled themes of domestic abuse from the perspective of the two artists. The song received five Grammy nominations and became Eminem’s best-selling single, cementing its place in the 2010s musical canon.
10. “Where’d All The Time Go?” by Dr. Dog 
I can still hear many of the songs that came out in 2010 in my mind as vividly as I did the first time I heard them, raising the question: “Where’d all the time go?” In their song of the same name, rock band Dr. Dog explores this question with a plaintive, melancholic tune that sums up the feeling of suddenly moving into yet another new decade. The result is a track that never loses its emotional relevance.

Happy fall! Just like the leaves, Netflix’s collection of films will be gradually changing this month: The streaming platform has a plethora of new content that will be made available for its subscribers this October. Here are a few selections to curl up with in the chilly weather.
“Hunt for the Wilderpeople” — October 1
Taika Waititi’s critically acclaimed adventure comedy-drama follows Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison), a rebellious juvenile delinquent, and his foster uncle Hector (Sam Neill) as they flee into the New Zealand bush and soon find themselves stranded. The national manhunt that ensues provides a unique bonding opportunity for the two, who team up to evade their pursuers. The film, which premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival, has been widely praised for its heartfelt family-oriented message and seamless blend of adventure and comedy. The two leads’ memorable dynamic and Waititi’s distinctive brand of deadpan humor make for a compelling, heartfelt narrative.
“Stranger Than Fiction” — October 1
In Marc Forster’s 2006 fantasy comedy-drama, lonely IRS auditor Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) begins hearing a disembodied voice that narrates his day-to-day life in real time with unflinching accuracy. Meanwhile, novelist Karen Eiffel’s (Emma Thompson) struggle with writer's block leads her to conclude that a satisfying ending to her book can only be achieved by killing off her main character, a man named Harold Crick. The realization that Karen’s writing and Harold’s reality are inextricably linked soon brings the two together, and the ensuing struggle raises mind-bending questions about agency and storytelling. The film has been praised for its star-studded cast’s endearing performances, and Zach Helm’s witty script.
“Moneyball” — October 14
This 2011 sports drama follows Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), general manager of the Oakland A’s, as he tries to assemble a competitive lineup for the baseball team’s 2002 season. The biographical film, directed by Bennett Miller, also stars Jonah Hill as Oakland Athletics' assistant manager, Peter Brand. Together, Beane and Brand rail against the system and outsmart greedy ball clubs using a tool called sabermetrics, a statistical approach to assessing and recruiting undervalued players. This acclaimed film nabbed six Academy Awards and four Golden Globe nominations.
“The Trial of the Chicago 7” — October 16
Set against the countercultural backdrop of the late ‘60s, writer-director Aaron Sorkin’s latest legal drama tells the story of the Chicago Seven, a group of anti-Vietnam War protesters charged with conspiracy and several other transgressions for riots outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Its ensemble cast features the talents of Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Michael Keaton, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, among several others. The film promises to be both exciting and immersive; beyond this entertainment value, however, it’s also a strikingly timely piece for today’s moment, as nationwide protests against gross racial injustice and systemic oppression continue to go strong.
“Mank” — October (unnanounced)
Acclaimed director David Fincher’s upcoming black-and-white biographical drama will premiere on Netflix at some point during October, though its exact release date has not been specified. The film examines the conflict that arose between screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewizc and director Orson Welles during the production of the 1941 drama "Citizen Kane". The film stars Gary Oldman, Amanda Seyfried, and Lily Collins, among others.
Alternatively, if you’re searching for distinctly autumnal content or a new scary flick, Netflix has announced plenty of upcoming releases that will help you get into the Halloween spirit. Here are a few quick suggestions for seasonal movies coming soon to Netflix:
“Cape Fear” — October 1
Martin Scorsese’s 1991 crime/psychological thriller is now available on Netflix.
“Vampires vs. the Bronx” — October 2
A group of teenagers must protect their neighborhood from a gentrifying brood of vampires in this Netflix horror-comedy.
“ParaNorman” — October 18
The 2012 animated comedy-horror arrives on Netflix just in time for Halloween.
“Rebecca” (2020) — October 21
In a new Netflix adaptation of the classic gothic thriller, a woman is haunted by the spirit of her new husband’s first wife. Armie Hammer and Lily James star.
“Cadaver” — October 22
This Norwegian no-sleep horror entry follows a family staying at a hotel in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster.
“His House” — October 30
"His House" is a new Netflix horror film following a refugee couple who encounter evil in their English town.

In his latest film, the documentary “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue,” famed Chinese director Jia Zhang-Ke (“Still Life” and “Ash is Purest White”) stitches together multiple accounts of the transformation of day-to-day life in the face of the Cultural Revolution from 1966-1976. Jia’s film chronicles an important stretch of modern Chinese history, an ambitious effort that weaves a diverse tapestry of themes — from the repercussions of the ending of arranged marriages, complications in filial relationships, and the rural versus urban cultural divide, to the role that literature and stories can play in transforming a small farming community in the province.
All of the film’s stories play out over the course of 70 years in Jia’s hometown in Fenyang, Shanxi, China. It’s a humble, rural town — and as the film progresses, one is left with the impression that they are not only learning more about the people speaking directly to the camera, but also a community they are being integrated into.
If “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue” can be boiled down to a singular thesis it would be how sweeping change in the last 50 years of Chinese history have left people struggling to keep pace. If anything, “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue” is a deft reminder that the stories of the generations that came before matter, not just as a footnote in an already sullied historical record, but as a means of dealing with the ways Chinese society is changing again with a technology boom and globalization. Just as people had struggled to keep pace in the ‘60s, many are falling out of touch today.
This incredible sense of earnestness propels Jia’s documentary, a feat aided by Jia’s creative crew. Cinematographer Yu Lik-Wai plays close attention to framing his subjects. In one scene, as a writer speaks of the literary changes in the ‘60s, he is framed through a glass window against the tainted reflection of a modern road with cars and shops. In another scene, an elderly man speaks about the transformation of filial relationships in a small farm, as his family prepares dumplings over the dinner table. Editor Kong Jing-Lei also flaunts his work with a dizzying montage that captures a local literature festival, complete with overlapping dialogue, quick cuts, and a mounting musical score to create an ominous sense of impending change.
Unfortunately, sometimes Jia’s efforts produce a maze too complicated for audiences to follow. “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue” covers 18 chapters, each segmented into a topic of conversation, from motherhood to literature to farming. But rarely do these segments and themes register as more than a sum of individual parts. The problem is not the breadth of topics, but the lack of cohesion that holds them together.
Also, while poignant, the ideas portrayed in “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue” sometimes feel inaccessible to mainstream audiences. The film’s press kit features a glossary of 16 historical events and 12 literary works; it would be useful if these were treated as required reading. But excluding such a lengthy, complex backstory is also an understandable decision: “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue” is not a high school history lesson, and it’s not meant to be. Jia helps the narrative economy of his documentary by excluding it.
Another example of this cultural barrier is the film’s use of idioms, which bookmark some of the film’s segments. In Chinese, idioms bear deeper meanings that go beyond word for word translations. The problem is, the film’s subtitles only ever show literal translations — it’s another small hurdle for unacquainted audiences to overcome.
It’s difficult to come up with a final verdict on “Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue.” For mainstream audiences coming in blind, Jia’s documentary will require patience. But for those armed with a basic understanding of modern Chinese history, Jia’s film is likely to strike a more resonant chord as a fascinating — if uneven — story about the resilience inherent to the human condition. Jia’s film was screened virtually at the New York Film Festival, which also featured a premiere of a high definition restoration for Jia’s directorial debut “Xiao Wu” (1997).

“It is a restless moment. She has kept her head lowered to give him a chance to come closer. But he could not, for lack of courage. She turns and walks away.” And so begins Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai’s legendary film, with these sparse, haunting words that augur the bittersweet intimacy and emotional complexity to come.
“In the Mood for Love,” popularly considered Wong’s magnum opus, details the emotional subtleties and private revelations of the connection between secretary Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) and journalist Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai). The year is 1962 in Hong Kong. After moving into the same building and growing closer, the two realize their respective spouses are being unfaithful, a source of shared vulnerability that deepens their friendship and challenges the boundaries of their emotional impulses. In order to better understand their spouses, Li-zhen and Mo-wan try to reenact moments of their relationship that could have led to infidelity. Though both protagonists use these staged interactions as a means of spending time together, neither admit that they are developing romantic feelings for one another.
Wong affirms his mastery of cinematic restraint with stunning visuals that reflect the quiet tension in the protagonists’ relationship. The most poetic sequences are characterized by purposeful absence: Wong employs sparsity as a means of promoting suspense, accentuating emotionality, and subverting expectations. Mo-wan and Li-zhen’s connection often manifests in glimpses of furtive smiles and brushed shoulders.
The film’s alluring power lies in its subversion — in the audience’s inability to distinguish between what is real and what is staged, a phenomenon that reflects the protagonists’ mounting emotional turbulence.
Wong’s shots are at their most breathtaking when Mo-wan and Li-zhen obfuscate the boundary between the real and the performed. One of the most dramatic encapsulations of this ambiguity is a confrontation that takes place between the two protagonists in the torrential rain. Li-zhen, donning a striking emerald dress tessellated with purple blossoms, leans against a brick wall as Mo-wan softly states, “I won’t see you again. Keep a close eye on your husband.” He grips her hand briefly before walking away. Her devastation is apparent in her wistful expression as his silhouette recedes into the empty alley.
The screen fades to black. Mo-wan’s voice fills the darkness, punctuated by Li-zhen’s sniffling: “Don’t be serious,” he assures. “It’s only a rehearsal. Don’t cry! This isn’t real.” Only moments later, as the shot pans from the brick wall to show Mo-Wan comforting a bereft Li-Zhen, is it revealed that this exchange was merely an act. The confusion of performed and genuine longing artfully mirrors the increasingly complicated feelings the protagonists share for one another.
Later, Mo-wan invites Li-zhen to accompany him as he moves to Singapore to start a new life. When she races from her apartment — a chaotic shot steeped in broody, saturated red hues that mirror her heightened passion and anxiety — she is too late. She sits, defeated, in an empty hotel room, a single tear carving a luminous path down her cheek.
The film skips four years. Li-zhen, now a mother, visits her old apartment. Mo-wan, now in Cambodia, visits Angkor Wat. He whispers into a hole in the temple’s stone, a direct reference to when he tells his friend An Ping (Ping Lam Siu) about how in the olden days people spoke secrets into the holes of trees before plugging them with dirt.
Wong’s most powerful decision is his refusal to grant viewers the faux security of an affirmative ending. The film’s final shots — filled with cool blues, greens, and grays — starkly juxtapose the smoky blacks and reds of urban Hong Kong. This visual distinction communicates that the era of the two protagonists’ enchanting connection is over.
The conclusion of the film, however, demonstrates that despite their choice to end their relationship, Li-zhen and Mo-wan’s feelings remain. Through understated yet impactful cinematography, Wong illuminates the tensions of his protagonists’ restrained connection. It is in his quiet, magisterial portrayals of emotion that Wong achieves a towering understanding of the persistence of human longing.

Dea Kulumbegashvili’s feature length directorial debut “Beginning” is a film about entrapment. With minimal dialogue and gorgeous cinematography, Kulumbegashvili portrays the suffocating role women are expected to play in a rigid patriarchal society — a society which only values them as providers for their husbands and children. While “Beginning” hardly treads new thematic ground, it is remarkable in how it conveys them; by leaving the camera as a stubbornly static participant, "Beginning" matches the entrapment of its central character with the entrapment of what viewers see on screen.
“Beginning” unfolds in a rural Georgian (the European one) town, where the central character Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) is the wife of a Jehovah’s Witness missionary, David (Rati Oneli). After religious extremists attack one of their sermons, the police refuse to intervene. Instead, the detective on the case (Kakha Kintsurashvili) begins exploiting Yana in disturbing ways. An already discontented Yana is soon forced to confront the inner struggles in her life, but just like her status in society, she stagnates.
The opening scene is incendiary. The camera sits at the back of a church as David and Yana welcome a community of believers. Five minutes into David’s presentation, Orthodox Christian extremists throw two Molotov cocktails into the building. This whole scene unravels in one unbroken take with a static camera, which compounds a feeling of shock and panic as people clamor desperately to escape. It demonstrates incredible restraint on Kulumbegashvili’s part to leave the camera stationary, and the decision pays off with striking effect: Viewers feel immobile and helpless amid the chaos.
Kulumbegashvili uses a static camera and long takes to emphasize a limited point of view. Cinematographer Arseni Khachaturan films with a squarish 4:3 Academy ratio — an outlier in today’s cinema, where the norm is a 16:9 widescreen. The narrow aspect ratio leaves less space to convey information on screen, making the whole film feel claustrophobic. But it’s also a trait that Khachaturan takes full advantage of with keen framing choices. In fact, he rarely pans or tilts the camera, forcing the audience to pay attention to the limited space available. In “Beginning,” what goes on outside the frame is just as important as what occurs inside it. Sometimes, in the middle of a conversation, a character walks off the frame and we hear echoes of the conversation continuing off-screen. But the camera remains stationary — focused on an empty hallway instead of following the character offscreen — and it can linger there for minutes at a time.
But while there is no doubt that these stylistic choices work harmoniously on a conceptual level, they don’t necessarily translate in practice. Kulumbegashvili’s stylistic choices make viewers feel as though they are never a full participant, but rather than sparking intrigue, the lack of a full point of view ends up feeling frustrating.
This compositional tension is evidently the feeling that Kulumbegashvili wanted to recreate for audiences — for them to identify with Yana’s hopeless entrapment in a life where she is so lost that she can no longer voice what she wants. But in a film with minimal dialogue and quiet delivery, “Beginning” is also an extremely difficult watch. Instead of Khachaturan’s stunning cinematography feeling noteworthy in the moment, the unforgivingly long takes — at one point focused on Yana sleeping on a chair for minutes on end — feel like the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. As a result, when harrowing events occur, the audience feels surprisingly uninvolved instead of shocked and disturbed.
“Beginning” will certainly find its crowd in select film circles, but it feels like the type of film that will be most remembered as a mandatory screening in an entry-level film class a few years down the line — and that’s something viewers can either love or hate. Kulumbegashvili’s film screened virtually at this year’s New York Film Festival, and also at the Toronto International Film Festival.

Like a fine brewer, director Christopher Nolan distills all the best elements of the quintessential action movie in “Tenet.” From the compelling characters to the intricate cinematography, the breathless pace, and the ingenuitive time travel concept, "Tenet" is a gripping action adventure experience.
The aptly named "Protagonist,” played by John David Washington, isn’t suave or cocky — a feat made abundantly clear by his frank authenticity and discomfort around Bond-esque wealth. Washington portrays his character in the sweet spot between the “reluctant hero” and “good guy” archetypes. He’s well-meaning and sincere, and he takes his world-saving mission seriously.
The supporting cast aids Washington in keeping the action grounded and the viewer invested in the grave and uncertain world of “Tenet.” From their initial encounter, the Protagonist and his accomplice Neil (Robert Pattinson) have an understated but genuine chemistry that gives the movie heart. Elizabeth Debicki’s character, Kat, plays with the stereotype of women in action movies. She may act as a sexy reward for the protagonist, but she does not look small or helpless. Kat has depth and grit, and the narrative doesn’t drop her for unexplained stretches of the movie so we can watch men punch things, as Marvel movies love to do.
In “Tenet,” Nolan flips some conventional tropes: The white man is the sidekick, and women can be agents, military leaders, and criminals, alike. The film doesn’t make any forced quips congratulating itself; this is just the way the world is. While “Tenet” might not be perfect, this representation is fantastic.
In another brilliant move, cinematographer and frequent Nolan collaborator Hoyte von Hoytema ("Interstellar" and "Dunkirk") shoots in mostly bright settings. Action scenes are well-light and visible, drawing the eye to all the hard work put in on screen.Contrary to popular action movies, von Hoytema films with a great sense of spatial awareness, so audiences never lose their place in the action. This includes sweeping shots of scenic landscapes, aerial shots over speedboats, and a low camera angle in a car chase scene that helps the action feel tactile and grounded.
While Nolan's fight scenes aren't completely fluid, he uses minimal cuts and ingenuitive takes to create cohesive, easy to follow action. The few cuts he does make zoom into closer shots of the characters, which help elevate the dramatic stakes. There is no shaky cam in sight. Nothing is hidden — least of all the explosions, which go off completely on screen. "Tenet" reportedly had a budget of $200 million, and that price tag can be seen in the attention paid to practical set construction on cars, on boats, and even on planes.
Dialogue exchanges between characters are quick, ensuring a film that is fast paced but followable. The actors are given enough time to breathe, and while "Tenet" juggles several characters and a complicated concept, it never feels like the movie is too eager to jump ahead of itself. Nolan also splices flashbacks into conversations to minimize dreaded exposition. Without breaking the flow of conversation, Nolan's quick flashback tableaus manage to "show, not tell." The pacing is on point, but the sound mixing occasionally makes the actual words difficult to distinguish, which is unfortunate considering the sheer volume of technical terms needed to understand the plot.
Nolan, who also penned the screenplay, often delves into clunky exposition to explain the central concept of inversion. It’s time travel, but it’s not time travel. Note to screenwriters: Throwing in some scientific babble doesn’t make anything clearer. Each of Nolan's many attempts to explain inversion fall short in a different way and, in the end, the average viewer is left at least a little confused. Despite this lack of clarity, the concrete rules that are established for "inversion" aren't broken, which means it's possible to follow the plot, even if the technicalities of the concept are never fully ironed out.
Overall, “Tenet” is mostly held together by clever, well-developed characters, exciting stunts, and a compelling plot. Nolan creates an exciting film where everything can be seen — from massive explosions in broad daylight to tight fight scenes without any shaky cam. These are traits that can be appreciated without understanding the often confusing nuances of “inversion,” and despite a premise that never quite clicks, all the other elements come together to make “Tenet” a fantastic new addition to the action genre.

Each year, the festival circuit is stuffed with beautiful but inscrutable films. While “The Woman Who Ran” veers dangerously close to that territory, it’s never impenetrable. Instead, acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Hong Sang-soo (credited here with the Herculean task of serving as writer, director, producer, editor, and composer) creates a film that, while far from a clear read, uses well composed cinematography and earnest character conversations to push multiple thematic interpretations.
“The Woman Who Ran” unfolds over the span of a few days as Gam-hee (Kim Min-hee) visits three of her friends while her husband is on a business trip, the couple's first days apart since they married five years ago. At first, these visits appear unrelated, dividing Hong’s film into three standalone tableaus. But closer inspection yields subtle similarities in these segments as Hong repeats motifs to form overarching conversations that constitute an intricate web of themes.
The most evident similarity between the visits is that all men are portrayed as self-important nuisances in a film where the major characters are women. Each of the three segments features a man who has his back turned to the camera: a pesky neighbor who complains that the women feed stray cats, a young poet who fervently proclaims his love for a woman weeks after a one night stand, and a narcissistic writer so caught up in his own success that he neglects his wife.
Hong makes sure audiences feel as uncomfortable as the women do in these scenes, as cinematographer Kim Su-min uses very pronounced camera movements and framing. In the COVID-19 pandemic, people might think they’ve grown accustomed to Zooming — but not like this. To say that Hong zooms often is an understatement; he uses it to end almost every shot. The evident artificiality of these shots makes the audience feel like a surreptitious outsider. We might as well be one of the male nuisances begging at the doorbell to be let into these women’s lives. Perhaps Hong is equally interested in portraying third party curiosity of these women as he is with the importance of their lives and their stories.
Kim often uses long, static takes — especially to mark the end of Gam-hee's first two visits, which included awkward interruptions from men who overstayed their welcome. The last encounter plays out as more shy and uncomfortable than awkward, as Gam-hee runs into her ex boyfriend (the acclaimed writer) at a movie theater after years of separation. It’s also the only instance where male and female characters aren’t separated by foreground and background distinctions (earlier, men had been blocky outlines in the foreground with the camera well situated for over-the-shoulder shots). Perhaps these distinctions were a stylistic choice for Hong to single out the importance of Gam-hee taking the time away from her claustrophobic everyday life to retrace her steps.
Gam-hee’s encounter with her ex also helps Hong comment on the dilation of time in middle age. Gam-hee has found herself trapped in a marriage that restricts her and a life that no longer excites her. In each of her visits with her friends, she finds something that she envies about their lifestyle: a house in the countryside with fresh air and scenic views, an upbeat partying lifestyle as an untethered single woman, or a lover who got away. It’s not a far cry to say that she is imagining how her life might have played out in all of these scenarios.
This raises the question: who is the “Woman Who Ran”? Hong most likely refers to a neighbor brought up in the first segment, a woman who left her husband and daughter one night and never looked back. It’s a choice that all these women have likely considered but never carried out. One is recently divorced, one is single and fending off a crazy lover, one is in an unhappy marriage with a spouse too self-absorbed to pay attention, and Gam-hee is in an unhappy marriage with a spouse too self-absorbed to give her any personal time. In the end, all these women want to run from their repetitive mundane lives, or at the very least, to imagine what they might be like without the controlling men currently in them.
Many of Hong's stylistic choices aren't quite self-evident, and some don't fit equally well with every hypothesis. Is the film a commentary on self-absorbed masculinity? On the throes of middle age? On the role of cinema in perpetuating voyeurism? Hong never finds the answers for all of these questions, but one thing is certain: "The Woman Who Ran" sure captivates audiences when it asks them.
“The Woman Who Ran” premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival, where Hong won Best Director, and is screening virtually at the New York Film Festival.

Few words can connote decadence as succinctly as “truffle.” The Alba truffle, which sells for an exorbitant $20,000 a pound, is only accessible to the most affluent clientele. But “The Truffle Hunters,” directed by Gregory Kershaw and Michael Dweck, is not a documentary about luxury, or food, or even luxurious food. It’s a film about how elite sellers have managed to prop up a multi-million dollar industry that sells exclusively to the world’s crème de la crème by exploiting small town elderly truffle hunters in the Northern Italian countryside.
Armed with beautiful cinematography and passionate testimonies from their titular subjects, “The Truffle Hunters” pays tribute to the quiet, unsung individuals responsible for delivering a renowned, coveted good. The truffle industry works like this — truffle hunters and their trusted sniffing dogs foray the forest for truffles, sometimes only finding one or two a week. Once they collect a sizable bundle (roughly every month) the hunters hand the truffles over to local sellers, often for a measly sum of €500 (just under $600). The sellers then find clients from restaurants to auctioneers, who pay unconscionable fees for thousands of Euros. In such a secretive market, there is little that small town hunters can do to contact a wealthy worldwide network of clientele, it’s difficult for them to gauge the real-time market value for their produce, and end up selling the truffles for pennies on a dime.
Kershaw and Dweck paint an industry divided by lines that run much deeper than class. On one side, the hunters display an infectious passion for their craft. None of these men have to continue hunting for truffles, and there's little economic incentive to do so. Many continue to scavenge for truffles well into their 80s, despite lacking the requisite physical fitness to traverse the mountainous terrain. Many love their dogs like their own children; their biggest worry is finding a worthy owner after their death to take care of their loyal hunting partners. On the other side, “The Truffle Hunters” also depicts the immoral depths people sink to for business gains, which include placing poisoned baits to kill off competing sniffing dogs.
Beyond the obvious moral disparities between the hunters and the business-side of the industry, “The Truffle Hunters” also delineates a conspicuous social divide. There's a vivid difference between the people so passionate about their work that they seek it day in and day out — despite their old age and the affluent clients who claim to be knowledgeable on truffles to get by in their social circles. This is perfectly encapsulated in a scene where people are taught how to distinguish a truffle by smell. The striking visual of two well dressed women sniffing at a sliver of truffle at the bottom of a wine glass seems so antithetical to the hard work the truffle hunters put in. It’s clear that this insular society of buyers are oblivious to any of the values important to truffle hunters. They don’t value the preservation of the forest, the sniffer dogs, or even the hunters as human beings. What’s important, of course, is the all-important ability to pinpoint a truffle's smell and finding the best wine to pair it with.
By shooting the documentary like a conventional narrative film, Kershaw and Dweck help audiences invest in their story’s rich themes. Popular documentary tropes, like voiceovers, found footage, and interviewees talking directly to the camera, are all abandoned. In their place is bright cinematography, with an evocative color palette ranging from light pink homes to cobalt blue interiors and luscious green forests. In a documentary, viewers typically react to a series of well presented facts and revelations, but there is always a barrier between viewer and story, between a fact and its subsequent effect on the viewer. That barrier is disbelief; viewers know that they are watching a representation of reality and not reality itself, something they’re reminded of every time they see an interviewee in an all-black room talking directly to the camera. It’s simply not a setup that plays out in real life. In “The Truffle Hunters,” that barrier is removed, as viewers find themselves more free to invest their emotions in a fiction-like reality.
While “The Truffle Hunters” doesn’t break any new ground, its solid universal themes, stunning cinematography, and genuine heartwarming cast of truffle hunters make the film a worthwhile watch. Kershaw and Dweck’s documentary premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and is currently screening virtually at the New York Film Festival.

“Smooth Talk,” directed by Joyce Chopra, was recently revived with a restoration at this year’s New York Film Festival. The film was originally released in 1985, but it deserves to be revisited in 2020. Based on the short story “Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?” by Joyce Carol Oates, the film follows Laura Dern as Connie, a 15 year old whose flirtatious nature alienates her from her family. This family oriented drama eventually transitions into the genre of suspense, as a sinister stranger named Arnold Friend (Treat Williams) shows up at Connie’s house while she’s home alone. With Laura Dern’s multifaceted performance at its forefront, “Smooth Talk” is a realistic portrait of family dynamics and a compelling look at the expectations imposed upon teenage girls as they come of age.
The summer before her sophomore year of high school, Connie spends her time with her best friends Laura (Margaret Welsh) and Jill (Sara Inglis), seeking male attention at the mall or a popular drive-in restaurant. Meanwhile, Connie’s mother (Mary Kay Place) thinks her daughter is headed down the wrong path, and openly prefers Connie’s eager-to-please, “good girl” older sister June (Elizabeth Berrdige). It’s a story that’s been told countless times — a teenage girl’s exploration of her sexuality creates tension in her family — but it’s executed with a sense of authenticity that is not always present in coming of age movies.
While some aspects of the film are exaggerated, like the “good girl/”bad girl” contrast between Connie and her sister, Chopra still creates palpable friction between the family members. June has a penchant for sitting at home and sewing, which is a bit unrealistic, but she’s nonetheless an effective foil to Connie. The most strained relationship in the family is between Connie and her mother, who lends nuance to a well intentioned but unsympathetic matriarch. “I look at you. I look right in your eyes, and all I see are a bunch of trashy daydreams,” is one of her first lines to Connie in the movie. These unnecessarily cruel remarks to her daughter are frequent, and Place delivers them with just enough biting snark.
A young Laura Dern gives an impressive performance that holds the film together, shining through the strong actors supporting her. Dern only just won her first Academy Award in 2020 for her role in “Marriage Story,” but the talent that earned her this recognition is perceptible decades earlier in “Smooth Talk,” when Dern was just a teenager. Her portrayal of Connie is both engaging and relatable; while Connie is written as a girl whose main interest is seeking male attention, Dern accesses a depth beyond this singularity. She wants to maintain a tough exterior — especially in front of her mother — but Dern gradually exposes her character’s vulnerability, showing off an extensive emotional range in Connie’s moments of insecurity.
In the final third of “Smooth Talk,” the film shifts dramatically in tone. A grown man named Arnold Friend shows up at Connie’s house while the rest of the family is out. He tries to coax her into going for a drive with him, and it’s revealed that he’s been stalking her; he knows a frightening amount of information about Connie and her friends and family. He’s convinced they’re meant to be together and will stop at nothing to get her to leave with him. Connie spent the summer wanting boys to be attracted to her. What does she do now that the wrong person is fixated on her? Throughout the film, screenwriter Tom Cole carefully alternates between showing the attention Connie desires (or thinks she does), and the completely undesired attention that goes along with her growing up in a misogynistic world. In one scene, she playfully flirts with a boy who just graduated from her high school, and in another, a group of men in a car harass her and throw cans at her as she walks home. In this way, “Smooth Talk” provides thoughtful commentary on the bittersweet duality of what it means to be a girl coming of age in a patriarchal society.
With Arnold Friend, Connie is reminded all at once how young she really is, and Dern captures her fear and naivete perfectly in this final sequence of the film. Connie’s character development reflects her traumatizing experience with him; by the end of the film, her loss of innocence has changed her, and Dern depicts this evolution with just the right amount of subtlety. In the final scene, “Handy Man” by James Taylor, which is a favorite song of her family, plays; “I fix broken hearts, I know I really can,” he sings. As Connie dances with her sister to the song, “Smooth Talk” shows us all the ways our hearts can be broken — but it also reminds us that they aren’t necessarily irreparable.

Bridgette C. Ramirez ’22 is the president of Mariachi Véritas de Harvard, Harvard’s student-run mariachi band. A member of the organization since freshman year, Ramirez plays the violin and vihuela, a traditional Mexican guitar-like instrument. The Harvard Crimson spoke with Ramirez about her favorite performance, fostering virtual community, and the future for Harvard Mariachi Veritas.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
The Harvard Crimson: So Bridgette, as the president of Mariachi Véritas, could you share with us a little bit about who you are and what Mariachi Véritas does as a band and organization?
Bridgette Ramirez: As the president of Mariachi, I am in charge of being the face of the band on or off campus, trying to find gigs, and actively putting us out there for the greater Harvard and Boston community to know who we are. As a band, we try to put forth a different image of what Mexican culture is by bringing students from all kinds of backgrounds, from all races, ethnicities, nationalities and with all kinds of experiences with instruments into one group — and then put music out for all kinds of communities to listen to and learn from. It’s a small tight-knit community. There are max like 15 of us at a time.
THC: Tell us a little bit about your own involvement in the band. What instrument do you play and what drew you to Mariachi Véritas?
BR: I came in playing the violin. My second year, I decided to take on an instrument called a vihuela. Honestly what I enjoyed most is that this band is a chance to take my mind off of school work and give space to explore something I’m really passionate about, which is music. At the same time, I was getting more exposure to Mariachi history, which is something very close to me, and I just enjoy how everyone is always there. You know each one of the other band members, so it’s like a second family from home.
THC: What’s an anecdote of your favorite memory as a member of the group?
BR: Last year — before we had to leave for quarantine and all — I think of the two years that I’ve been a part of the band, [we had] the best performance that I was a part of. The crowd was incredibly engaged! Before coming to Harvard, before joining the Mariachi band, I’d never experienced what it was like playing before a crowd and feeding off of the energy. At that concert, we had dancers from Harvard Ballet Folklórico de Aztlán come down, and they performed with us. It was just a really great environment. A lot of people were there for the second time; it was really nice to see familiar faces and also new ones. I was just so proud of the entire band because it was completely our efforts and it definitely showed through once we had our performance. It was a really great moment.
THC: You mentioned briefly how this concert occurred before quarantine began. How have social-distancing guidelines impacted your band’s practices and performances?
BR: Up until now, we’ve been mostly holding socials, trying to keep in touch with each other. Typically, we have two-hour rehearsals twice a week, but now we’re holding one-hour rehearsal with the section we’re in and one-hour rehearsal with the whole band. So we’re definitely cutting down rehearsal time a lot because Zoom fatigue is real and we don’t want Mariachi to be just another thing to hop onto Zoom for. Now we have the Day of the Dead, which is one of our most popular days of the year. We’re going to be compiling videos of us performing two to three songs, and we’ll be sending out equipment and traditional face painting in preparation for that.
THC: What do you miss most since quarantine began?
BR: I definitely miss rehearsals, but I think I miss our socials a lot more. Since there are so few of us, we would get to all bond together. Sometimes we would all just sit in a circle and talk at the same time. It’s great. There’s really no way to replace all that time and interaction. That’s been very difficult shifting to the new setting. Regardless of whether or not we’re active, as a group we are always staying connected. Our sense of family definitely shines through regardless of what’s going on.
THC: Once quarantine ends, what would be the first thing that you’d plan for the band?
BR: Our retreats are always the most memorable moments out of the entire year. So I’d definitely plan a retreat for us: just spending a few days cooking together, jamming out together, going to explore the city together. Our retreats have always been a really great memory of our year, so it would be a great way to just reconnect and realize that we’re all still okay and that we’re all excited to be back and be together. We used to see each other a lot throughout a week and suddenly to just cut it off and to not see these people anymore is a huge hole in our lives. Some really quality time together would be the first thing I’d plan for us when we get back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When “Riverdale” actor KJ Apa uploaded a video of himself and castmate Camila Mendes demonstrating one of the show’s newly implemented COVID prevention practices to Instagram, many fans had questions — and justifiably so. The video shows Apa and Mendes gargling mouthwash for approximately 30 seconds; in the caption, Apa writes, “our new normal is washing our mouths before every take of a make-out scene.”
Like most other scripted television shows, production for “Riverdale” has been thrown wildly off course by COVID-19. As the pandemic raged on, “Riverdale” began filming its fifth season on Sept. 14 after its cast and crew completed a two-week quarantine. As videos from the Riverdale set circulated throughout social media, many called into question the effectiveness of a safety protocol that seems to do the bare minimum; one Twitter user remarked, “not sure what mouthwash does against COVID but the Riverdale cast never fails to entertain me.” Not much, it seems: According to the Hollywood Reporter, production of “Riverdale” was paused once again after just two weeks of filming due to a testing gridlock in Vancouver, where “Riverdale” and several other U.S.-based TV series shoot. Nevertheless, Apa’s video led many to wonder what television production looks like in the midst of a global pandemic.
The fall premiere has long been a staple of television: Typically, cooler weather and shorter days signal both the return of beloved shows after long summer hiatuses and the debut of new series piloted in early spring. The vast majority of shows saw production grind to a screeching halt at the beginning of the pandemic, leaving many networks with no new live action content to air in September and October. Some shows, including popular dramas like “Law & Order: SVU,” “Good Girls,” and “Empire” — still in production as state after state gradually shut down — were forced to end their seasons prematurely, leaving their original episode counts unfulfilled and the tail ends of their season arcs incomplete or hastily rewritten.
Many networks have thus far relied on reruns and content acquired from streaming services and international broadcasters to pad their lineups, but more and more casts and crews are now venturing into the studios once again. But how are these bold production teams dealing with the many state regulations and health and safety restrictions posed by the coronavirus pandemic? Just how sustainable are their efforts?
The nature and setup of both daytime and late night talk shows have allowed hosts including Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, Stephen Colbert, and Trevor Noah to continue producing episodes of their shows from the comfort of their own homes. Shows like “The Talk” and “The View” have employed the video call format for months now — perhaps the safest approach to television production in the era of social distancing.
Similarly, a number of scripted series have simply postponed or suspended production, at least in person, until further notice. Shows such as “Pose,” “Russian Doll,” several upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe Disney+ shows, and “One Day at a Time” — which artfully worked around quarantine restrictions by producing an episode relying on animation and voice acting — took this approach. Several notable scripted series have now resumed filming. The ABC Sitcom “The Conners” — believed to be the first broadcast comedy to start producing new episodes — resumed production in mid-August with “minimal crew” and without a studio audience, according to Deadline. Executive producer Bruce Helford has said that certain amounts of personal protective equipment are required in particular zones on set; actors are also frequently tested before entering the soundstage. Similarly, the “Grey’s Anatomy” cast returned to set on Sept. 8; showrunner Krista Vernoff has said that “massive” adjustments have been made to allow for the production of Season 17. “It’s social distancing, it’s masks, it’s visors, it’s masks on the actors between takes and during rehearsals,” she said. Even so, these modifications sound less like “massive” structural adjustments and more like baseline precautions that may suffice for normal office settings, but might not be as effective in the hyper-interactive world of film and TV production.
Are regulations such as these all that can be done to ensure the safety of casts and crews working during the pandemic? Although certainly more difficult in practice, production that occurs almost entirely remotely may not be infeasible. The miniseries “Love in the Time of Corona,” for example, is incredibly experimental in its production, but perhaps a bit too timely. The series, which was conceived of, written, and produced during the pandemic, assembled a cast of people quarantining together in real life and shot wirelessly on-location with crew stationed outside each couple’s home. “Love in the Time of Corona” jumped through an impressive amount of hoops for safety’s sake, but this approach to pandemic-era art might only work for a distinctly pandemic-era show whose characters are social distancing as well. In this way, radical modifications to the shooting process, like having actors operate their own cameras in their homes and directors instruct them from outside via walkie-talkie, might necessarily detract from TV’s escapist appeal: It’s safe to assume that the majority of viewers would probably rather watch characters living their lives freely in a COVID-free reality than characters who are quarantining like them.
And what about reality television? Although several reality shows have continued in a remote format, others have opted for the exact opposite approach. “Big Brother” and “Love Island USA” — shows whose very premises rely on over a dozen people living in very, very close quarters with each other — have pushed through the pandemic. The premieres of both shows repeatedly reassured their audiences that the cast members were keeping safe, with rigorous testing and quarantine measures in place. True, the closed set “retreat-style” settings of shows like these and “The Bachelorette,” which filmed its upcoming season over the summer, create relatively safe environments in which interactions occur only between cast and crew. Still, one has to imagine that even one COVID case would wreak havoc on these cramped sets. “Love Island,” for example, gave each contestant a custom champagne glass with their name on it, so as to avoid cup confusion. Of course, that safety precaution quickly became null and void almost instantaneously as the singles started hooking up.
Like with most industries, the pandemic has presented Hollywood with an unprecedented set of challenges, posing a myriad of questions that producers, directors, and actors have never before had to consider. And producers’ approaches to the pandemic are about as varied as television programming itself. Although filming and production strategies might range from completely remote compliance with public health guidelines to filming environments that seem perhaps alarmingly lax, a common thread runs throughout most of television: One way or another, the show will go on.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard does not care about its students of color.
By now, I am sure most have heard the name David D. Kane. The controversy around Kane began after he decided to invite Charles A. Murray ’65 to speak about his new book to his class, Government 50: “Data.” Murray’s work has been labeled “racist pseudoscience” by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The controversy then intensified when students discovered Kane’s website EphBlog, where Kane has allegedly written many racist blog posts under a pseudonym. Despite student protests, however, the University has done nothing substantial in regards to his status as a preceptor.
I find it difficult to believe that the administration was unaware of Kane’s alleged actions prior to his being hired, but I will try to give them the benefit of the doubt. What I cannot overlook, however, is that this is the latest example of a larger hiring pattern: instructors whose beliefs make them unfit to teach.
This semester Harvard has also employed Diana J. Schaub, who has a history of controversial beliefs, as a visiting professor in the Government Department. In one essay, Schaub states that the decline of Black people in professional baseball is due to the “absence of fathers in the black community.” In another, Schaub argues that “the contemporary phenomenon of angry middle-class blacks derives in substantial part from the erosion of both Bible-based faith and faith in Progress.” And in another, she argued Baltimore’s declining population is due to a low marriage rate and high abortion rate, particularly among African Americans. These essays are, if not outright bigoted, ignorant, and deeply concerning.
Some might think that prior writings on one particular set of issues might not necessarily be relevant in a classroom setting. But the problem is Schaub’s work on that set of issues is key to the class she’s teaching. Part of her research focuses on African American political thought. Harvard hired her to teach a course on African American political thought. How can Schaub successfully teach such a course if her academic work reveals that she holds such bigoted views of African Americans? And it seems she has already made students uncomfortable with her remarks in class.
Experiencing both Schaub’s and Kane’s class at the same time is exhausting for me as a student. To read excerpts of Schaub’s beliefs makes me feel as though I have been betrayed. Professors are trusted to represent the material they cover with sincerity, but in this case, it feels as though I have been lied to and exploited by someone in a trusted authoritative position.
And Harvard allowed this to happen. Harvard put these instructors in positions where they could disguise and push their own beliefs under the veil of academic pursuit.
If Harvard truly did not know about the pasts of these two faculty members, that presents its own problem. One would think that with a reputation to uphold, Harvard would care to invest enough resources to vet instructors before hiring them. So, if the administration truly did not know, I would call on Harvard to vet applicants more stringently and do better.
Or, more likely, Harvard did know. In Schaub’s case, at least, her past work wasn’t done under a pseudonym, and it only takes a quick internet search to find these essays. That leads me to question why Harvard proceeded to hire her anyway, especially to teach a class on African American political thought. Does Harvard wish to make their students of color uncomfortable? Challenging students’ views can be a good thing. But the pursuit of academic discomfort should not entail condoning ignorant bigotry.
The opinions held by instructors wield too much influence not to be heavily scrutinized. So, what Harvard must do now is simple. Fire Kane and Schaub, and any other faculty member with similar unacceptable views. Then, establish a proper vetting system that prevents the hiring of others like them. No more lengthy emails and empty promises. No more half-hearted measures. The voices of students cannot be ignored any longer; it is time they are finally heard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When a staff member tested positive for COVID-19, Harvard University Dining Services workers in Quincy House were told by a manager to go home, but four were then asked by another to stay and serve breakfast to students. UNITE HERE Local 26, the labor union that represents the dining workers, began an investigation into the conflicting instructions and is in discussion with the University to understand the timeline of events.
We hope this investigation proceeds fairly and transparently and that the University has engaged in good faith with the union to arrive at an understanding of what proper safety protocols are and whether they were breached. If so, steps must be taken to ensure that it does not happen again, that the point of confusion is clarified, and that the safety of all workers, students, and other community members are appropriately safeguarded.
But in the short term, the chaos and uncertainty facing Quincy House staff — one of whom reported the day of the test that they were still unsure whether they were expected to report the following day — should remain the focus: Such lack of clarity, both as matter of public health and of respect for workers, is unacceptable.
Particularly as Harvard has gone to great lengths to erect an elaborate testing system with multiple tests per week for employees and students, the politics of which groups live under which regimes of care looms large. In constructing such a system, at the cost, according to University President Lawrence S. Bacow, of tens of millions of dollars, Harvard necessarily has to make decisions about whose care to prioritize and how to do so. In choosing to test HUDS and other workers less frequently, Harvard deprioritizes their well-being.
Harvard has consistently shown itself slow to accommodate the needs of workers through the pandemic. That began last spring, when Harvard shortened contracts for staff unable to work due to the virus, before extending it to the end of June under pressure from unions and activists. It continued, when, in September, privately contracted employees, which includes dining hall staff, reported not receiving the same degree of testing as other campus affiliates. And it appears to be happening again as the collective bargaining-agreement of 1,ooo custodial and janitorial workers is due to expire in November and, despite an active petition requesting a year-long extension of the current agreement, perhaps unsurprisingly, the University has not agreed.
By inviting back only a small fraction of the student body, Harvard made a calculation about how many students it could afford to keep under the aegis of regular testing and a constrained environment. But if those potentially exposed to COVID-19 in Quincy are not sure what to do in the event of a positive test among their dining hall staff, that uncertainty is another indication of a lack of care for clarity and certainty about the rules that apply to Harvard’s staff.
Harvard’s labor community is Harvard’s community. The workers who, in happier times, sustained us through problem sets, midterms, and community nights deserve the freedom to prioritize their health without fearing for their employment. They deserve certainty over employment contracts that should see them through the year. They deserve a system that treats them with the same degree of communication, respect, and concern for their safety as it does students.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Almost every Harvard student of the past decade has contributed to the collaborative literary masterpiece that is the Q-Guide comment section. At the end of the semester, some students use their new-found freetime to craft poetic odes to a great course or professor, while others assemble cutting polemics no less artful — all in wonderful anonymity. A few highlights:
"Don’t be daunted by Ed Glaeser — he’s a cutie in disguise."
"If you have to take this class, it is because you are a sinner, for if you had not sinned, God would not have sent this course as a punishment."
Wedged between these quippy one-liners are essay-length screeds, often quoting directly from lecture or even citing previous Q-comments in delightful cross-generational self-referentialism that contributes to the Q’s impression as a unified work.
But while comments are useful and often amusing, there’s also an unsettling tenor to many of them. Consider a certain low-rated, required class in the Statistics concentration. One student felt so brutalized by one Statistics class that they felt obligated to write 880 words detailing its flaws. They quote reviews from the past several years which complained that problem sets were returned far too late to be helpful. Despite these past reviews, little change was made. We read that this student said half of their problem sets were unreturned at final exam time, and the feedback was inconsistent and unhelpful.
The reviews of many required Computer Science classes can be similarly dispiriting. One jokes that while two professors in the department are “insensitive and more or less own the fact that they are,” the third professor “differs from the two in that he is completely unaware of the effect his course is having on students.” Many of the reviewer’s classmates join them in panning the course materials in their comments, citing not only “minor misspellings / occasional off-by-one errors” but also “typos that actually affect the student’s learning.”
One review says that when these concerns are brought up, the professor “literally said to students that finding errors helps with my ~learning~ and ~depth of understanding~, but if you're like me and learning these things for the first time, all this does is create endless frustration and a shaky foundation for the rest of the CS courses you'll take.”
Another review described one professor explaining his Q-scores on the first day of class with “required+hard=sucks.” Fair enough. But too many of these complaints are not inherently about difficulty. They’re about quality. Harvard’s commitment to teaching foundational technical courses is severely lacking, and the University should be embarrassed.
There are shining exceptions. Professor Blitzstein (Q-score 4.4) read a comment that his otherwise good class was ruined by the lack of a textbook, and responded by writing an entire textbook. Professor Kohler teaches a large, unusually time-intensive CS lecture class but maintains a 4.6 Q-score through incredible conscientiousness and responsiveness to student feedback. But this receptivity is the exception. As I scrolled through the Q Guide, it felt like cohorts of STEM students were shouting their very specific and reasonable complaints into the void, unheeded.
The same University that moves mountains for endowment parity, that obsesses over cross-admit yield rates and USNWR rankings, seems not to have considered that maybe its commitment to excellence should extend to teaching. If the richest university in the world cannot afford sufficient course staff to return problem sets on time, then maybe the development office should start prioritizing pedagogy-restricted donations.
Better teaching would open the pockets of future alumni with a correspondingly better recollection of their college years. It would substantially improve yield, too. It is absolutely in Harvard’s self-interest, even narrowly conceived, to improve the quality of undergraduate teaching, and we should press the administration to appreciate this.
Finally, better teaching is a matter of social justice. My parents both have graduate degrees, and my private school prepared me very well for Harvard; in poorly taught technical classes, I can scrape by on prior knowledge and a well-educated support network. But as some Q-comments explicitly express, poor teaching constitutes an extremely unwelcoming introduction to the technical departments at Harvard that deters people of color from continuing in the these fields: “You will likely not want to continue in CS after the course if you have had little experience in the field before.”
Poor teaching deters underprivileged students from technical majors and widens racial and gendered wealth gaps. Its practical impact on racial justice cannot be overstated, and student activists and Undergraduate Council leaders have an obligation to pressure Harvard to prioritize undergraduate teaching.
It is great that we have a mechanism for providing feedback to professors and TFs, but too often the effort students put into their responses is wasted. Instructors have a gold mine of frequently constructive criticism that they neglect to our great disadvantage. Having the Q-Guide is a great first step, but the University needs to go further.
Professors should be expected, for example, to directly and constructively engage with negative Q reviews in their first lecture. A simple, substantially increased commitment of attention and resources from the University would both pressure and enable professors to solve a lot of the problems I’ve mentioned. I want to call Harvard the greatest university in the world with pride and sincerity, and improving its teaching is, as the Q would say, a necessary prerequisite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student-athletes living on campus began sport-specific training Monday as Harvard Athletics entered the next phase of bringing Crimson sports back to Cambridge amid the coronavirus pandemic.
During Phase Two of the plan, athletes can participate in workouts specific to their sport for up to two hours each day. Still, they must maintain proper social distancing, wear masks, and congregate only in groups of up to ten people, College spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an email.
For the first month of the semester, Harvard did not offer any organized athletics activity to students on campus. Phase One, which began last week, allowed athletes to participate in organized strength and conditioning workouts with their teammates.
Women’s ice hockey player Rose I. O’Connor ’24 took to the ice on Monday for the first time as a Harvard athlete. She and her only fellow teammate on campus — also a freshman — suited up in equipment and had the rink all to themselves.
“We were the first two to step on it. Stepping on a new sheet of ice is so nice — it’s really crisp. You can hear all your edges cutting, too,” she said. “It was definitely special, just like the two of us being there.”
O’Connor, who said she considered taking a gap year, said she was grateful that Harvard made an effort to allow athletes to practice their sport while on campus.
“I would have been really, really bummed if we couldn’t skate or do anything for this year,” she said. “It would have just felt like a year missing sports.”
Prashanth “PK” Kumar ’21, who manages the men’s tennis team, said he and his teammates were grateful to return to Beren Tennis Center on Monday to go through drills and rally with each other.
“Part of our team culture is being grateful for what we have,” Kumar said. “Not every sport is allowed to do their full activity or whatever because — imagine like wrestling or other sports where you have to be in close contact with other people — they’re not allowed to do that.”
Harvard Athletics spokesperson Timothy J. Williamson wrote in an email that he believes the University is unlikely to further lift restrictions on athletics activity. Phase Three, which lifts restrictions on social distancing and groups, runs counter to College-wide policies.

Organizers for Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers are circulating a petition that calls on Vice Provost for International Affairs Mark C. Elliott and the Harvard International Office to act in opposition to the Trump administration’s proposed visa policy change for international students.
Citing national security concerns, the United States Department of Homeland Security issued a “Notice of Proposed Rulemaking” on Sept. 25 that would reduce the amount of time international students can spend inside the country.
If the ruling comes into effect, international students on F and J nonimmigrant visas will be required to apply for a visa extension after staying for no more than four years. If a student were to come from a country with visa overstay rates of over 10 percent, they would be obligated to have their legal status re-evaluated after two years.
“In addition, as proposed, certain categories of aliens would be eligible for shorter periods of admission based on national security, fraud, or overstay concerns,” the DHS notice reads. “DHS believes that this process would help to mitigate risks posed by foreign adversaries who seek to exploit these programs.”
HGSU-UAW’s petition denounced the proposed rule, arguing that it sent an unwelcome message to international students who want to study in the United States.
For Aayush Khadka, a graduate student organizer, the move is the latest in a series of efforst by the Trump administration to make it more difficult for international students to live and study in the United States.
“The proposed rule has the potential to disrupt the lives of all international students and international student workers in a major way,” Khadka said. “I am in the last year of my Ph.D. program, but, you know, the rule won’t even spare me.”
Khadka is from Nepal, which is listed as a country with a visa overstay rate of greater than 10 percent. Should the ruling be implemented, his future in the United States could be jeopardized.
“From the time the rule is implemented, the duration of stay on my I-95 form would change the current duration of status, I guess, to a two year provision,” he added.
Even in his post-graduate career, Khadka would have to travel out of the country to get a new visa or apply for an extension of stay just two years into his professional training — a process that could take up to six months.
HIO sent an email to all international students about the DHS proposal Sept. 29, notifying them that Harvard’s leadership would review the notice and respond in coordination with other academic institutions.
“University leadership is reviewing the proposed rule and will work with colleagues at our peer institutions and national associations in DC to respond to the many concerning provisions of the proposed rule and to support our international community in the best way possible,” the email read.
Francesca Bellei, another graduate student organizer, said she felt HIO’s message to students was not enough and stressed that the University should take more concrete action.
“Unlike the July 6 ruling, there was no strong statement of unequivocal condemnation, there has been no swift legal action,” Bellei said. “I think that’s also because this proposed rule is a lot harder to fight legally, because it is written differently.”
Bellei referred to the University's lawsuit against a July DHS and ICE order that would have forced international students to leave the country if their schools went remote for the fall term. After Harvard and MIT sued the agencies, the order was rescinded.
The HGSU petition also calls on Harvard to communicate with international students about the consequences of the proposed rule and detail the actions Harvard is taking to oppose it. It demands the University host an information session with an immigration lawyer to provide further guidance.
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jason A. Newton called the proposed rule “ill-conceived.”
“The Trump Administration's new proposal to restrict international students and scholars through a proposed rule to limit the duration and validity of visas, and to introduce new reviews by DHS of the academic progress of visa holders, is the latest in a series of ill-conceived policies, orders, and practices to undermine the U.S.’s position as the top destination for the world’s best students and scholars,” Newton wrote.
Newton said the University will submit formal comment to the federal government as the proposal approaches final review.
“The University will participate in this process to share our abiding support for international students and scholars, and in the hope that these views will encourage DHS to reconsider its deeply flawed proposal,” Newton added.

The Systemic Justice Project at Harvard Law School has partnered with Howard University School of Law to launch a year-long initiative exploring the role lawyers can play in creating social change.
Called the Justice Initiative, the project aims to bring together law students, faculty, legal professionals, and activists to advise students interested in justice-oriented careers. It features a series of presentations and panel discussions, as well as a retreat.
Enumale M. Agada, a Harvard Law School graduate who helped organize the initiative, said in a press release that the program has launched in a moment when many Americans are challenging both inequalities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and centuries of systemic racism.
“Our hope is that the Justice Initiative will help encourage this generation of law students to view their role in society as that of changemakers and social engineers and foster a legal education system that better prepares law students to take up these mantles,” she said.
Systemic Justice Project Director Jon D. Hanson said the success of a virtual summer program created in partnership with the People’s Parity Project and Justice Catalyst in response to the pandemic also inspired the endeavor. Zoom meetings made it possible for several hundred law students and lawyers who otherwise might never meet to participate in the Justice Initiative.
“This combination of what's needed and what's possible makes this a pretty special time and more or less the Justice Initiative is a response to that combination of felt urgencies and opportunities,” he said.
Hanson explained the program will consist of three-hour sessions held on Saturdays. These meetings will introduce legal theories, such as feminist theory and critical race theory, that are not often highlighted in law school curricula. Later sessions will then apply these theories to cases law schools often cover.
The initiative will include opportunities, such a career forum, during which students can learn how to find fellowships and get involved in social justice work.
Justin Hansford — director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center at Howard University School of Law — described the partnership between the two schools as a “match made in heaven” in a press release. He noted Howard Law’s legacy of teaching students to be both lawyers and “social engineers” began with Charles Hamilton Houston — a Harvard Law graduate and former Howard Law dean. Houston served as a special counsel to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the 1930s and dedicated his career to fighting racial discrimination.
“We will seek to use law, organizing, and research to create social change,” Hansford said in the press release. “In many ways, this partnership brings us full circle.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scholars discussed the origins and evolution of migration and border politics at a panel discussion Monday evening, pointing out violence throughout the history of American immigration policy.
Panelists at the event, which was hosted by the Mahindra Humanities Center, also highlighted how immigration intersects with issues of women’s reproductive rights, racial prejudice, and criminal activity. The discussion followed recent reports of forced hysterectomies on migrants in a Georgia detention facility, as well as long-standing sanitation issues in detention centers.
The event — the second in a three-part series entitled “Border Inhumanities” — was moderated by History professor Kirsten Weld. Panelists included University of Massachusetts at Amherst Professor Laura J. Briggs, Emory University Acting Professor Nicole M. Guidotti-Hernández, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Associate Professor A. Naomi Paik.
Despite the increased national attention toward immigration policy under the Trump administration, the panelists warned against what they called “Trump exceptionalism”: the idea that issues at the border are new or worse under the current leadership than they were previously. Several panelists alluded to policies enacted by the Clinton and Obama administrations that restricted and criminalized migrants.
“We get the impression that the solution to this is going to be a new president,” Briggs said. “In fact, what we see is Democrats, the Democratic Party, channeling opposition to the kinds of immigration policies that Trump has enacted. And yet, they are not that different from Democratic policies over a long period of time.”
Paik argued that the history of anti-black racism is intertwined with the history of immigration, referencing the 1929 Undesirable Aliens Act that criminalized unauthorized border crossing in the U.S. South Carolina Senator Coleman L. Blease — who led the push for the law in Congress — was a devout segregationist.
“I think it’s really important for us to think about how these kinds of tactics by the state to expel, exclude, and deport people are mobile,” Paik said.
The panelists also argued that those in power have continuously tried to portray and justify this history within a nationalistic narrative.
“It was a strong reminder that everything we're seeing with border inhumanities in our modern day is a repeat of history, and part of the reason we repeat history over and over again is because we never learn history accurately,” said Josephine M. Kim, a Graduate School of Education lecturer who attended the event. “It's intentionally kept out of our history books, and narratives are told from a single perspective only.”
Many migrants have already faced trauma in their home countries, Guidotti-Hernandez noted, such as domestic violence, genocide, and organized crime.
Panelists also described a paradox between the economic necessity of immigrant labor and the criminalization of these marginalized communities.
“Historically, the United States has wanted people’s bodies and labor, but not their reproduction, and not their citizenship,” Briggs said. “And so as long as Mexico and Central America and a host of other places can function — essentially bantustans — as reserves of labor that can be called up at certain moments and sent back at other times, people are welcome.”
Despite a focus on disheartening facets of the country’s immigration system, the panel ended on a note of hope. Guidotti-Hernández said she sees “real opportunities” to help one another and “find our voices” in the current climate.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Author Ebony O. McGee, an associate professor of Diversity and STEM Education at Vanderbilt University, spoke about institutional barriers people of color face in STEM fields during a Gutman Library Book Talk webinar Monday.
McGee’s forthcoming book, “Black, Brown, Bruised: How Racialized STEM Education Stifles Innovation,” focuses on how racial stereotypes affect the experiences of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people in STEM fields. In her presentation, she discussed how the legacy of white supremacy stifles innovation and called on institutions to pursue change, drawing on both historical evidence and her own experiences as a Black former engineer.
McGee said infrastructure developments from STEM fields have historically oppressed minorities, citing design efforts for highways and mass transportation that contributed to segregation. She also described how competition-induced stress in the sciences can be exacerbated for students of color.
“It’s difficult to be a STEM student of any color, but then you also suffer from this kind of minority status stress,” McGee said. “You have what I refer to as racial battle fatigue, where you’re just tired of defending or proving your value in STEM over and over again.”
According to McGee, many universities do not fully address the reality of the institutional obstacles many of their students of color face. In her book, McGee writes about how academic institutions dismiss the experiences of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students through “imposter syndrome” workshops.
“They tell you to breathe and say affirmations in the mirror, and do a yoga pose, but the biggest thing they tell you to do is to change your thinking,” McGee said. “Nine times out of 10 for underrepresented black and brown folks, their thinking is absolutely correct.”
“It is not in their head, and you cannot yoga your way out of a legacy of 400 years of structural oppression,” she added.
James S. Holly, Jr., an assistant professor of Urban STEM Education at Wayne State University, attended the talk and praised McGee for a fresh perspective on the intersection of diversity and global development.
“The biggest argument is that [ethnic minorities] will help global technological competition and competitiveness,” Holly said. “But [McGee] throws that out, saying we've been stagnant because we've been excluding these people.”
Gurlovleen K. Rathore, an evaluation officer at the STEM Advocacy Institute, attended the webinar and said McGee’s work resonated with her own personal experiences within STEM.
“The presentation was also somewhat affirming, because I know as a student as I was coming through the system, I had an internal locus of control. Like if I failed at something, I thought something was my fault,” Rathore said. “But as I kind of went through the bachelor’s and a master’s and a PhD in engineering education, I finally came to the recognition that it was not me.”
“It is that the system is not working,” she added.

With a global pandemic trolling all aspects of the college experience, obviously the hustle and bustle of the one and only Harvard Yard has been disrupted. While the obnoxious tour mobs are temporarily out of sight, out of mind, plenty of masked faces continue to pass through the gates — even after 6 p.m., when only two entrances are open, and Securitas patrols them both. Who are the people behind these masks, and what are they up to?
The Important People™
Back in the pre-corona days, if you were really paying attention, it was easy to spot President Bacow (or, more accurately, his black vehicle parked outside Mass Hall) or Dean Khurana in the Yard. These days, with masks and social distancing, identifying the higher-ups is a little harder; but if you gaze down Oxford Street, you might peep Dean Khurana rolling up to campus on his blue moped.
The Spike Ball Bros
Being a freshman is tough. Before campus became socially distanced and people were actually allowed to hangout together, some underclassmen hoped to connect with lifelong friends through their IM teams. Without this opportunity, our hardcore hobby athletes still need an outlet for their sporty tendencies. Enter the spontaneous, hardcore spikeball tournaments that can pop up anywhere at anytime in the Yard. Watch out, or an aggressively played spikeball might take you down!
The Dorm Escapees 
With the majority of our favorite spots on campus inaccessible at the moment, freshmen and upperclassmen on campus have to get creative with their study spots and socially distanced hangout locations. Not only might they be struggling to focus on their psets with a bed calling out from across the room, but they also might be flirting with insanity after weeks stuck inside. The only solution: Escape the indoors! Many of these brave individuals can be found in the Yard working, lounging, or simply refreshing their memories on the smell of fresh air.
The Tourists
While they might not swarm the Yard in impassable masses at the moment, the tourists are still here, and they’re still walking in our way and getting handsy with the statue. Not even masks can hide their true identities, especially when they start taking pictures of students in their first floor dorm rooms…
The Freshman You Matched with on Tinder 
We’re all lonely these days. Whether you’re on Tinder or you just haven’t admitted it yet, passing through the Yard could provide the perfect opportunity to spot the freshie you matched with. Did they message you at 2:34 p.m. because they have absolutely nothing to do? Did you message them at 4:50 a.m. because quarantine has completely destroyed your sleep schedule? Who cares! This is the time to make your move but definitely from at least six feet away.
Next time you hangout in our favorite yard, keep your eyes open, and you might notice some of these interesting characters. And if you’re really lucky, you’re already one of them and now have an article written all about you! To all those meandering through the gates, stay healthy, enjoy the Yard, and look out for misaimed spike balls.
