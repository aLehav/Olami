After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
America’s relationship with the Jewish state has never been simple. From the first pilgrims, who looked to create a New Israel when they landed at Plymouth Rock, to Theodore Herzl—one of the original Zionists who flirted with the idea of placing the Jewish state in Texas—the United States was frequently associated with the Semitic homeland. When Palestine was announced as the new location, foreign department officials told presidents from Howard Taft to Franklin D. Roosevelt that supporting the Zionist state was against America’s best interests. Against the efforts of the American Zionist Emergency Council—think a 1940s version of AIPAC—the CIA argued in 1947 that the Zionist leadership had an agenda that would threaten “the strategic interests of the Western powers in the Near and Middle East.”
Sixty years and several fateful wars make quite a difference. With its weight fully behind the Jewish state, the United States has hitched its “strategic Western interests” directly to Israel’s future. This leaves America with a heavy political litmus test and little margin to compromise—something that will weigh heavily on John Kerry’s renewed efforts to broker peace along the Gaza Strip.
Support for Israel in America is not only top-down—96 of 100 senators in 2000 signed a resolution expressing support for the state—but bottom-up, with a February Gallup poll showing that two of three Americans sympathize with Israel. The Jewish state gets more than $3 billion from the United States in foreign aid each year; Obama says the U.S. “has no better friend in the world than Israel.” This isn’t a concern in and of itself for America abroad, since other would-be allies are quickly falling in the region. With Hezbollah, a group hostile toward the interests of the West, taking control in Lebanon and Egypt and Jordan falling into turmoil, Israel is the only stable and pro-American country in the region.
The strategic importance of having an ally in the Middle East, a region where the Persian Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom have done little to endear the West to the residents, cannot be overstated. As Turkey becomes more hostile to the United States, with Iran’s anti-American sentiment resonating louder and louder in the region to boot, the progress of the Hillary Clinton administration may quickly disappear. To fix this, Kerry has picked the issue that most divides the region: the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Currently, Israel has done little to express support for a Palestinian state. The Likud Party in power in Israel openly rejects any possibility of Palestinian state and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, less radical on the issue than many in his coalition, will not risk putting it on the table for fear of losing his coalition. Similarly, Obama’s support for the idea is belied by the same dominant Israeli political forces. This leaves little room for compromise on other solutions since a one-state solution will not satisfy Palestinian nationalists who remember the way they were treated by the Israeli government in the Gaza Strip and risks throwing the entire region into chaos.
Thus, for better or for worse, America’s position is set in the dispute. The Israel lobby, led by AIPAC, stands along with the NRA and AARP on the pantheon of powerful Washington lobbying groups. Although he later redacted his comment, Chuck Hagel initially drew accusations of anti-Semitism when he described how “the Jewish lobby” intimidated politicians. Last November, when Israel ordered another round of bombing in the Gaza Strip—bringing the death toll up to 90—a combined zero members of the House and Senate voted to condemn Israel’s action, a reaction the Palestinian delegation called “biased and weak.” Even Rand Paul, who advocates ending all foreign aid, would slowly wean the Jewish state off instead of cutting it off completely.
While strong congressional support brings America closer to Israel, it weakens its position in a region where anti-American sentiment is already quickly ascending. The Jewish state holds immense strategic importance for the United States, but a hardline commitment to it has antagonized possible regional allies. Even as drone attacks in Yemen and Pakistan make it difficult enough for the U.S. to extend an honest olive branch, an uncompromising position on Israel makes it nigh impossible to do so. For that reason, as many have prognosticated, the new peace talks will end the same way that they have each other time: with a very partial mediator unable to reconcile two sides with wildly different positions.
Ultimately, many factors limit America’s ability to pose as a legitimate mediator for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The United States’ legislative ruling body is nearly unanimously supportive of Israel, and political pressure to take Israel’s side limits the extent to which Kerry, like diplomats who struggled to do so before him, may be able to exert pressure on Israel to compromise. The more radical Israeli government and weakened Palestinian state—who enter the talks in the unenviable bargaining position of having little to offer—make reconciliation a distant possibility. This is representative of a larger truth about what has been a haphazard U.S. Middle East policy: For better or for worse, Washington’s fortunes are directly tied to Jerusalem’s.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The start of the school year at Harvard is always a special time. The crisp fall weather graces Cambridge, the environment is relaxed and stress-free, and best of all, whenever conversational skills fail you, you get to ask the other person what he or she did this past summer. Unfortunately, in the countless conversations I have had since the start of the semester, the different answers to this question have left me discontented.
Upon beginning my freshman year last fall, an upperclassman shared some advice: “Don’t get caught up in the Harvard bubble.” This statement, paired with my main goal to travel as much as possible during my college career, led me to travel to Hong Kong over spring break with the Harvard College in Asia Program and then to study in Venice this past summer with Harvard Summer School. As I returned for my sophomore year, I anticipated that most of my classmates had been traveling as well.
I quickly discovered that this was not the case. In the ambitious atmosphere of Harvard, many students feel compelled to get a head start in their career trajectory: If I am pre-med, I should probably stay on campus and do research, and if I want to enter the world of finance, I should get an internship in New York City. In the Harvard bubble, students want to build the most competitive professional application they can, often sacrificing play for work. In turn, many students will forgo travel in order to pursue a practical preparation for their future careers.
While jobs and internships are viable for the summer between junior and senior year—when students have declared a concentration and are more confident with their future careers—I was a bit disheartened when fellow sophomores were speaking about their summers in a lab or office. Freshman and sophomore years should be used to explore and discover one’s passions rather than to prepare oneself for a career that won’t begin for another three or four years. Students have the rest of their lives to work at an internship or job; this is the time to take advantage of our youth and see the world. This is the time to stray away from the bubble’s norm. This is the time to travel abroad.
More students—particularly freshmen and sophomores—should consider traveling instead of summer internships. The growth that results from experiencing life in a new culture is unsurpassable; the marvels of interacting with people who lead such different lives; the culture shock of getting lost on a bustling street with a language barrier; becoming familiar with foreign customs and values. Traveling allows students to leave their comfort zone and challenge their existing mindsets. From the Symphony of Lights of Hong Kong, to the calm, colorful calles of Venice, traveling expanded my worldly perspective, and I realized that although I come from the small town of Dearborn, I am not just a Michigander or an American citizen; I am from this Earth, and it is my duty while living on it to see as much of it as possible.
Nonetheless, many students may not share this wanderlust. Yet even for the practical types who feel confident in the trajectory of their future careers, it can be useful to experience how other countries’ career systems work. By learning about a country’s public issues and social approaches, we are able to apply fresh, diverse ideas to various fields of study. Experiencing life in a foreign country broadens our skillsets and thought processes; traveling has as much personal value as it does practical value.
There is no better time to travel than during the college years—when you are your sole responsibility, when you are exploring your interests and figuring out what you want to do with the rest of your life. When you are free to choose how you wish to spend your summers.  Moreover, and I cannot stress this enough, it is wise to take advantage of the opportunities, programs, and resources that are at your disposal during your time here at Harvard. Almost all travel opportunities can be funded; sources range from the Office of Career Services to the many centers—such as the David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies—which provide funding for particular regions and activities. Traveling is not exclusive to the summer term either; many student-run college programs and clubs offer cost-free chances to travel over winter or spring break. Though many students say they intend to travel in their future, the best time is now, when the responsibilities are limited and the travel is free.
A large aspect of my undergraduate career will be highlighted by my past and future travel experiences, and I would not have it any other way. I have been bitten by the globetrotting bug, and I am already searching for my next destination. The number of stamps on my passport has become a benchmark of my growth in my undergraduate career.  Students should not feel hesitant to pursue endeavors that will contribute to their personal growth as much as their professional growth. Traveling abroad does just that. This is the time for escapades and exploration. As Ellie told Carl in Pixar’s “Up,” “Adventure is out there!” There is a whole world waiting for you to explore it—you just have to pop the bubble.

"Brooke! Stop that!" My hand shot back to my side…but…oh no…not quite completing the task on which my pointer finger was so vehemently focused, I could feel the crusty flake barely clinging to the inside of my right nostril. It tickled in the most annoying of ways, practically screaming to me that it was still there. I shook my head violently from side to side. Nothing. I opened my mouth, sucked in as much air as I could, and forced the air out of my nose in short, hard spurts. Still nothing. The tickling continued, working its way into my brain as an itch that could only be taken care of in one way. I knew what I had to do.
I glanced left and right to check that the coast was clear, taking an extra second to make sure my mom was focused on her telephone conversation. I turned my back, hunched my shoulders slightly, and poked my fingernail into the appropriate nostril wall. Nail outward and first knuckle bent at a 90-degree angle, I maneuvered my finger around and down until it reached the edge of the booger. One last glance at mom and then I was committed. I slid my nail under the flake's edge like a pro, and flicked outward. Immediately, a wave of satisfaction overcame me, revealed to the world only by my mischievous three-year-old smile. I had once again gotten away with picking my nose.
As a child, I struggled with the constant urge to pick my nose. Try as my parents may to break me of my publicly frowned upon and arguably disgusting habit, I simply could not resist the urge to purge my nostrils of anything gooky, flaky, crusty, or squishy. I also could not believe that I was the only person in the world in whose nose one would find such grotesque materials, or alternatively, the only person in the world whom it bothered. But during that time of scolding and hand-swattings, I certainly felt like I was. Only later in life did I find out the truth: According to the infamous Dr. Oz, the average person picks his nose five times an hour. Assuming that somebody is awake for 15 hours during the day, that's 75 times we pick our noses each day! There's even a medical term for the habit of picking one's nose: rhinotillexomania, from the roots "rhino" meaning nose, "tillexis" meaning "habit of picking," and "mania" meaning "excessive enthusiasm." And yet, picking one's nose in public is one of worst things a person can do on the scale of "things a person is not supposed to do in public." It's even worse than farting because at least there is some element of uncontrollability when a person passes gas.
While I am generally all for defying cultural norms and being true to ourselves and our habits, society may actually be onto something with this one. It is a fact that snot and boogers are breeding grounds for germs. Dr. Oz referred to our wet and sticky nostrils as a petri dish for potential viruses, should they somehow make it into our noses. So the problem really is not so much exporting our own germs into the surrounding environment, but inserting germs from the outside environment into a part of our bodies where they will likely grow.
On the other hand, recent research has been conducted investigating the potential health benefits of picking one's nose. Canadian Professor Scott Napper believes that by consuming mucous in the nose, the body is introduced to a harmless sample of germs, which ultimately boosts the immune system. He derives his idea from previous theories indicating that the apparent increase in allergies and autoimmune diseases can be traced to improved hygiene. By eating our boogers, our bodies are potentially exposed to certain bugs, and our immune system learns permanently how to fight off those bugs should they ever cross our paths in more dangerous numbers in the future.
It's true—some of us cannot help but judge that person in the corner who sneaks a quick pick when he thinks nobody is watching. It is the reaction we have been brought up to have. However, the next time you find yourself witnessing such a scene, I implore you to think back to the last time you yourself engaged in the same, satisfying action. My guess is that it wasn't longer than 20 minutes ago.
And if you are a self-admitting nose-picker, don't fret. Nose-picking is a habit enjoyed by people of all ages, genders, personalities, and social classes—even Her Highness Queen Elizabeth II was caught picking her nose on camera in 1996! There are just a few important things you should keep in mind: First, keep your hands habitually clean so that you can pick all day, free of worry about germs or viruses. Second, consider making your potentially annoying habit useful by eating your pickings, and thereby readying your immune system to take on whatever illnesses are thrown at it this semester. Finally, always remember that you can pick your friends, you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the realm of international diplomacy, off-the-cuff comments usually start wars, not end them. Last week, a seemingly offhand remark by Secretary of State John Kerry might have halted the United States’ half-hearted limp toward another imbroglio in the Middle East.
In response to a horrific chemical weapons attack last month, President Obama set out to enforce his “red line” ultimatum and sell another war to the war-weary public. Lacking the support of both the American people and the British parliament, Obama sought congressional authorization for a limited strike—and even that wasn’t guaranteed.
But during contentious negotiations in Geneva between the U.S. and Russia—Assad’s principal backer and main military supplier—Kerry, in an apparent moment of frustration, said, “He could turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week…without delay and allow the full and total accounting.”
The Russians saw an olive branch, and issued a deal that would do just that: Syria would sign chemical weapons treaties, allow inspectors access to facilities, and agree to destroy all its chemical weapons stockpiles by 2014.
While we applaud the peaceful overtures from Moscow and prefer diplomacy over military intervention, the deal requires the continued cooperation of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who may view diplomacy as a stalling tactic for more time to crush the losing rebellion.
Putin has been funding and backing Assad’s war, but he is clearly enjoying his new role as peacemaker. In a charmingly disingenuous and churlish op-ed in the New York Times, Putin made the case for peace couched in the appealing language of international law and order, though he couldn’t resist repeating the ridiculous claim that the rebels had deployed sarin against themselves in an elaborate false flag stunt.
As Hendrik Hertzberg of the New Yorker put it, Putin is “the tsar of all concern trolls.”
But though there is ample reason for skepticism toward Russian intentions, a deal that averts the possibility of another protracted war—at least temporarily—should be welcomed. No matter its source, the goal of preventing a dictator from using chemical weapons on his own people is a just one.
Although Russian and American relations are at a nadir since Edward Snowden’s asylum request and Obama’s decision to cancel a one-on-one summit, letting a righteous peace deal fall apart because of mutual distrust and suspicion would simply be inimical to both Russia and America.
As Dostoyevsky wrote, “Viper will eat viper, and it would serve them both right!”

UPDATED: September 17, 2013, at 1:27 a.m.
Twenty-one professors from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences have been appointed by FAS Dean Michael D. Smith to advise him as he navigates the search for a permanent Dean of Harvard College this autumn.
The new committee, which has yet to meet, is tasked with combing through a list of recommended candidates solicited from faculty members, narrowing the roster of candidates, and, ultimately, consulting with Smith on finalists for the position, according to FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal.
The group will also query Harvard constituents at-large to better understand “what the community thinks are the opportunities and challenges in front of Harvard College and its students, and how these should inform the priorities of the new dean,“ Neal wrote in an email.
Most directly, that outreach will take the form of four on-campus meetings with students scheduled for the fall—one in the Quad Houses, one in the River Houses, and one in the Yard—as well as one meeting with the Undergraduate Council, scheduled for Sept. 22. Members of the committee will also consult House Masters and College staff.
“I feel it is vital that we create multiple opportunities for faculty and students to weigh in on the qualities that the next permanent dean will need to serve the Harvard College community well,” Smith said in a statement to The Crimson. “I’m committed to broad consultation and look forward hearing from the students, faculty and staff.”
Smith formally began the search process during the summer, sending two emails to the faculty asking for names of potential candidates, according to Neal.
Also during the summer, Smith appointed Donald H. Pfister, Dean of Harvard Summer School and a systematic botany professor, to serve as Dean of the College on an interim basis.
Upon taking office, Pfister told The Crimson that, at most, he would likely serve for just one year.
Pfister’s appointment came a little more than a month after Smith announced on May 28 that Evelynn M. Hammonds would step down from the deanship. The resignation came amid pressure over covert searches of the email accounts of resident deans, which were conducted in connection with the Government 1310 cheating scandal. Hammonds formally ended her tenure on July 1, drawing to a close her five-year deanship. 
The search committee for Hammonds’ permanent replacement includes representatives from each of FAS’s three divisions and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as several current and former House masters. 
The committee members, in alphabetical order, are history professor Ann M. Blair ’84, history professor Vincent Brown, SEAS professor David R. Clarke, classics professor Emma Dench, Leverett House master Howard M. Georgi ’68, philosophy professor Ned Hall, biology professor Elena M. Kramer, economics professor David I. Laibson, history of art and architecture professor Carrie Lambert-Beatty, government professor Steven R. Levitsky, history of art and architecture Yukio Lippit, SEAS professor Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan, economics professor Gregory N. Mankiw, biological oceanography professor James J. McCarthy, Mather House master Christie A. McDonald, Eliot House master Douglas A. Melton, English professor Louis Menand, psychology professor Matthew K. Nock, associate history professor Kelly A. O’Neill, assistant astronomy professor Alicia M. Soderberg, and SEAS professor Todd Zickler.

Less than five minutes after Cabot Cafe opened its doors at 9 p.m. on Sunday, more than a dozen people had already come in, ordered coffee, and gathered around the many tables and couches that populate the space.
This year marks the beginning of the cafe’s third full year in operation since Cabot residents Laura S. Hinton ’13, Jesse J. Kaplan ’13, Chandan G. Lodha ’13, and Daniel M. Lynch ’13 founded the space in 2011.
Tian L. Kisch ’15, Cabot Cafe’s marketing manager, said she expected the venue’s first night open to be busy because it offered all sophomores a 50 percent discount as an incentive to visit and sample the cafe’s offerings.
“We want them to see this space as theirs too,” Kisch said.
According to Kisch, Cabot Cafe’s managers have been planning for the 2013 launch since May, coming up with new menu items and playlists to attract more patrons to the establishment.
By contacting student artists to display their work, Kisch said the cafe will provide a new space for Harvard’s most creative students to showcase their work.
“We are proud that, in addition to being a cafe, it’s also an art gallery and performance venue,” she said.
In addition to student-produced artwork, the cafe has revived its “Meet the Team” bulletin board, on which pictures of the student employees are posted. Other features new to Cabot Cafe this year include customized paper sleeves for coffee cups and free chocolate peanut butter cups with the purchase of a drink.
Operations manager Carmen A. Tracy ’15 said that Cabot Cafe’s popularity can be attributed to its unique function on campus.
Tracy said the cafe—which closes at 1 a.m.—fulfills an “unmet need for a social space and caffeine late at night,” noting that the Starbucks several blocks away closes at 11 p.m.
Currier House resident W. Powell Eddins ’16, who said he found the cafe after discovering he would be moving to the Quad last spring, also said he believes Cabot Cafe serves a communal purpose.
“It’s a good social space for everyone in the Quad,” he said.
 Other students who frequent Cabot Cafe said they enjoy its relaxed, yet social atmosphere.
 “It feels cozy, but it doesn’t feel cramped,” said Miranda J. Morrison ’14, adding that its “student-driven atmosphere” distinguishes it from other cafes on campus.
 Though Morrison said she does not enjoy drinking coffee, she is living above the Cabot Cafe space for the third year in a row.
Monica A. Ukah ’16, another Cabot resident, also said she found the cafe to be cute, cozy, and quaint, adding that the drinks are “really good.”

Eighty-six students have declared their candidacy for a representative seat on the Undergraduate Council in the upcoming fall general election, according to Sahil A. Khatod ’14, head of the UC Election Commission.
The number of people who declared their candidacy in the UC elections this year is 11 fewer than did so in 2012.
This year saw a decline in interest among sophomores, juniors, and seniors—14 fewer upperclassmen are running for an open position in this year’s election than in last year’s, while the number of declarations among the freshman class increased by three.
Freshmen make up more than half of the candidates running in this year’s election, although only 12 seats are awarded to first-years—three for each freshman residential neighborhood.
Elm Yard, which is made up of freshman students living in Grays, Matthews, and Weld, will play host to the most contested race of the semester, with 14 freshmen vying for its three open seats. 
The number of candidates exceeds the number of openings in the other Yards as well—13 students are running in Ivy Yard, 10 in Crimson Yard, and 9 in Oak Yard. Apley Court, Hollis, Holworthy, Lionel, Mass. Hall, Mower, Stoughton, and Straus comprise Ivy Yard; Pennypacker, Hurlbut, Greenough, and Wilgglesworth make up Crimson Yard; and Canaday and Thayer form Oak Yard.
A small number of upperclassman Houses, which also get three representatives each, look forward to competitive elections as well. In both Leverett and Currier, four of the five candidates are running having served on the UC in the past.
While most Houses have three seats open, Dunster and Mather have only two, and Kirkland, one. Representatives from those House are currently UC committee chairs, and therefore will not be up for re-election until the spring.
A few representatives face what is likely to be a easy campaign.
No students declared candidacy for the one seat guaranteed to Dudley House, which represents the off-campus contingent of Harvard students. In Adams, only one student is running to fill the three available seats. In total, barring any write-in candidacies, five seats could remain vacant following this round of elections—two from Adams and one each from Cabot, Dudley, and Eliot. 
Currier, Dunster, Leverett, Lowell, Kirkland, Mather, Pforzheimer, Quincy, and Winthrop each have the same number of declared candidates as open seats.
The candidates, who had to submit their declarations this past Friday, can officially begin campaigning at noon on Monday.
Voting begins at noon on Wednesday and ends the same time on Friday.

A year after its inception, Divest Harvard continues to garner support from many students, faculty, and other members of the community for its efforts to force the University to divest its holdings in fossil fuel companies.
 
On Monday, the coalition of students, faculty, and alumni will host an event in front of the Science Center featuring Oliver W. Stephenson ’90 and other alumni speakers.
 
And on Friday, the group hosted a “Teach In,” an information session that featured faculty from across the University—including chemistry professor James G. Anderson and history professor Joyce E.Chaplin—along with Divest Harvard Faculty Outreach Coordinator Hannah M. Borowsky ’15 and Harvard Business School alum Robert K. Massie.
 
Over 300 colleges and universities nationwide are active in promoting the divestment of holdings in fossil fuel companies. The city of San Francisco, Unity College, and Hampshire College are among the institutions that have divested. Last week, the First Parish Church in Harvard Square hung up a banner which read, “We divested, your turn Harvard.”
 
The Divest Harvard movement gained traction last spring when a petition calling for Harvard to divest garnered more than 1,300 signatures and was delivered to the Harvard Corporation. On the Divest Harvard website, the group invokes environmental pleas to justify its calls for the University to immediately freeze its investments in “fossil fuel corporations.”
 
“This isn’t just any problem,” Massie said. “This is a problem about the destruction of life on Earth.”
 
Anderson said that the University would face a host of logistical issues should climate change cause the Arctic to melt, which he said could result in the city of Allston being submerged underwater.
 
“It’s not about global warming,” Anderson said. “It’s about fundamental, irreversible changes to the structure of the world’s climate.”
 
While aware of the concerns of environmentalists, University leaders have not demanded that the Harvard Management Company—which oversees the University’s endowment and financial assets—change its investment strategy.
 
At a forum hosted by the Undergraduate Council and the Harvard Graduate Council last October, University President Drew G. Faust said that HMC is committed to generating funds to support education and research and not to advancing particular agendas. In November, a Harvard spokesperson said that the University is not considering divestment.

The eight senior class marshals for the Class of 2014 represent just four of Harvard’s 12 Houses: three are residents of Cabot, and for the second year in a row, three call Quincy home. One comes from Mather and the last, from Kirkland.
Senior Class Marshal election results were released early Monday morning, with Jennifer Q. Zhu ’14 and Christopher H. Cleveland ’14 named First and Second Class Marshal, respectively.
“I was in complete shock when I found out I would be First Class Marshal,” Zhu, who is the Undergraduate Council Vice President, wrote in an email. “I was on the fence about running, but I was really lucky to have some amazing friends reach out to me and encourage me to consider running, because they knew how much I cared about the school.”
The eight marshals will serve on the Senior Class Committee along with House Representatives, the Class Secretary, and the Class Treasurer. The committee is charged with planning and running social activities and events for the senior class, culminating in Senior Week and Class Day at the end of the year. The committee is also responsible for organizing reunions and other alumni events after graduation.
All eight elected marshals said they are already thinking about plans for the coming year.
“I am envisioning many outings to museums, live shows, and wacky senior bars, as well as study breaks and dance parties,” Yolanda K. Borquaye ’14 wrote in an email. “But I am also excited to hear what the rest of my classmates envision for our final year here at Harvard, so we can make those happen as well.”
Anthony A. Palillo ’14 said he hopes the committee will find creative ways beyond just Boston outings and senior bars to bring the class together and make memories.
“We could have a senior time capsule or something, and maybe also a senior class Tinder-type app,” he wrote in an email, referencing the popular matchmaking application for smart phones.  “At the end of the day, I really just want the class to come together and make memories to last a lifetime.”
In addition to organizing Senior Week, the Senior Class Committee is also charged with finding speakers for Class Day.
When asked who their ideal Class Day speaker would be, the eight marshals named everyone from the Clintons to Beyonce. The Obamas, Tina Fey, Jimmy Kimmel, Ellen DeGeneres, and Jennifer Lawrence also came up as possible contenders.
While Zhu listed big names like Hillary Clinton among her ideal picks, she also cautioned that securing a speaker can be difficult because Harvard does not pay for speaking fees.
“One big misconception about Senior Class Committee is that Harvard provides funding for events,” she wrote, adding that she and Cleveland had already talked to last year’s first and second class marshals about the difficulties of securing a Class Day Speaker.
This year’s group of class marshals represent diverse backgrounds and interests, with members who have taken part in activities ranging from the UC and FOP to Pops Orchestra and PBHA. But all of them expressed gratitude for the opportunity to serve their senior class.
“It means that I have the privilege to work toward the good of my class, now and into the future,” Cleveland wrote. “I consider the position an honor.”
Erin D. Drake ’14 said that for her, “being a Class Marshal means investing in Harvard and investing in the experiences of students like me.”
“Harvard, for better or worse, means a lot to me, and the experiences I have had over the past three years have shaped the person I am and the person I want to become,” Drake wrote in an email.
Zhu, Cleveland, Borquaye, Drake, and Palillo will be joined as class marshals by Akshay M. Sharma ’14 of Cabot, Roland Yang ’14 of Kirkland, and Ginny C. Fahs ’14 of Quincy, also a Crimson magazine editor.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From the sound of the gun, the men’s race of the Harvard cross country team’s season-opener against Yale was effectively a competition for third place.
Crimson seniors James Leakos and Maksim Korolev took control of the race from the start, opening up a 10-second lead over the rest of the pack in the race’s first mile. Leakos finished in first place with an 8k time of 23:32, good for a pace of 4:44 per mile.
Korolev fell back in the last two kilometers of the race, but comfortably finished in second place, crossing the finish line in 23:50.
“The race went really well,” said Leakos, who won the Harvard-Yale meet during his sophomore season and took second place to Korolev last year. “We stuck to the plan—we went out really hard and made them hurt early, strung them out, and just kind of ran away on them.”
The Harvard men turned in a perfect score of 15 at the dual meet, with the team’s five scoring runners taking the race’s first five spots. The Crimson women’s squad also topped the Bulldogs, 20-39.
“It was an exciting opener for the team,” said junior Viviana Hanley, who won the women’s race. “We had a pretty good pack, which was our goal. Coming off last year, when we didn’t have a great opener and Yale beat us pretty hard, it’s really nice to come back to our home course and reverse that.”
In the men’s race, sophomore Tom Purnell led the pack that followed Leakos and Korolev. At about the midpoint of the men’s 8k course, Purnell separated himself from the field into a comfortable third-place finish, leaving senior Kurt Ruegg and junior Will Geiken to compete with Yale’s Alex Conner for fourth and fifth place. Both Ruegg and Geiken were able to pull away from Conner down the stretch, securing the sweep for the Crimson.
“The strategy was for me and [Korolev] to take off and run a really solid first mile, open it up a little bit, and see where it went from there,” Leakos said. “It’s wonderful having [Korolev] as a teammate. I was training with him over the summer, and it’s the best thing in the world having a teammate as good as he is.”
The victory is the third consecutive win for the Harvard men over the Bulldogs. When the Crimson lost to Yale four seasons ago, during Leakos’ freshman year, he fell during the race and sustained a concussion.
“We were coming into that race [four seasons ago] having won the last few years and we blew it,” Leakos said. “For me, that’s when the [Harvard-Yale] rivalry really started. We swore that that was never going to happen again, and we dreamed of the time when we would sweep them. And today, finally after three years, we have.”
On the women’s side, Hanley pushed the pace early and held a roughly five-second lead throughout the race. Senior Morgan Kelly was battling Bulldog senior Liana Epstein for second place until the final stretch, when Epstein pulled away and nearly caught Hanley. Hanley covered the women’s 5k course in 17:56, with Kelly close behind in 18:02.
“I don’t usually front-run, so it was a little nerve-wracking,” Hanley said. “I wasn’t really planning on it—our coach said, ‘Don’t go out too fast,’ but I felt good, so I was just telling myself, ‘Don’t look back, just go.’”
Rounding out the top-five for Harvard were freshman Madeleine Ankehlyi, junior Jennifer Guidera, and freshman Sarah Gillespie, who finished in fourth, fifth, and seventh places, respectively.
A large contingent from the Crimson track and field team showed up at the meet, which was held at Boston’s Franklin Park, to support their teammates. The Harvard-Yale dual meet is the squad’s only home meet, and the location alternates between Boston and New Haven each season. Saturday’s meet was the 100th installment of the storied rivalry.
“It’s a big deal to have the rest of the track team here,” Hanley said. “My roommate biked over, and I’m local so my dad was here, and so was my high school coach. It makes a huge difference; it’s incredible to have the support.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking all 110 possible minutes, the game between Harvard men’s soccer team and visiting Lafayette at Soldiers Field Soccer Stadium was a dog fight throughout, ultimately ending in a scoreless tie. The Crimson had many opportunities late, but could not quite manage to put the ball in net.
The lack of scoring was certainly not due to a lack of energy. Although the game started off slowly for both teams, a fired up Harvard (0-3-1) team was able to get the ball up field throughout the second half of the game, but had trouble putting it in the box, with many opportunities coming from long lob balls that were quickly headed out by the Leopards’ (1-0-5) defense.
“On the offensive side, we are getting good chances, but we have to get more numbers in the box,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said.
Freshman forward Ashi Geberkidane led Harvard with three shots for the game, including a near score at the end of the first extra period. A ball from outside found him in the box and he tried to go nearside, before the goalie smothered it. Geberkidane was just one of a number of freshmen that contributed significantly Sunday afternoon.
Throughout the game the Crimson got tripped up in the box a number of times and attempted to draw penalty kicks to no avail. Overall, the teams were dead even on fouls, 12-12.
Lafayette on the other hand had trouble maintaining possession in its attacking third all game. As a team, the Leopards only took six shots and earned just one corner. Harvard managed twelve shots and attempted six corners, including one to end regulation.
Co-captain goalkeeper Brett Conrad had four saves to earn his first shutout of the season in goal for the Crimson. For the year he has averaged 1.88 goals allowed and secured 20 saves.
“He was very good at organizing, and that’s a big component of keeping it out of the net,” Lehrer said.  “You could hear him and [he took] a big jump forward in that respect—improved at it a lot.”
The goalie was quick to credit his back four for helping with his success. Lafayette was unable to crack through them all game and they were integral in sending balls back into the offensive end after they had been cleared out to keep the pressure on the Leopards’ goalie.
“I think the defense did a great job, just a lot of communication,” Conrad said. “Something we had struggled with was just going the full 90 minutes. We put that effort in and it was just a great team performance.”
After such an energetic regulation, many players on both sides were visibly tired, stretching and rehydrating. Despite the fatigue, both teams came out strong in overtime.
“It’s all part of our philosophy, we like to do a five minute pushup before the game to mentally prepare ourselves to make sure we have the inner fight at the end of the game,” Conrad said.
From the sidelines it was palpable how much this philosophy was in effect. Harvard’s players were involved the whole game, even if they were not on the field, pleading with the referees and encouraging their teammates.
“We see everyone on the team as a leader, and they have to contribute,” said Lehrer.
In the end Harvard was happy to get any result in its favor. The tie snapped Harvard’s three game losing streak, getting it it’s first result of the season. It also was Lafayette’s fifth in six games this season allowing it to remain undefeated.
Despite failing to earn the first win of the season and his first win as head coach of the Crimson, Lehrer remained optimistic about his team.
“I think the energy of the group is phenomenal,” Lehrer said. “When we get our opportunities up front we must make sure that we take them—that we finish them.”
Coming up for the Crimson is a road game at Hartford on Friday, then back to Cambridge for a grass match on Sunday against in-state rival Massachusetts. Harvard certainly believes any of the games are winnable. League play starts Oct. 5 with a trip to New Haven.
“We’re good enough to compete with anyone we play,” Lehrer said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s golf team won the Princeton Invitational tournament this weekend in Springdale, New Jersey. In addition to the team victory, junior Tiffany Lim was the individual champion at the event, winning by three strokes.
“We’re really excited that we won our first tournament of the season,” Lim said. “We’re also just exhausted after 54 holes this weekend.”
The success came at the home course of Ancient Eight rival Princeton, who pushed the Crimson in the Ivy Championships last season, finishing second by only one stroke.
The Harvard girls got off to an excellent start on Saturday with two team rounds of 291 over thirty six holes. By the end of the first day, the Crimson held a seven-stroke lead over Princeton.
“It’s always important to get off to a good start and we did that,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “The team did that as a whole but we were helped out by Tiffany and her amazing first round. Then we just continued that start into the second day and were able to come away with the victory. It’s a really good start for our season.”
As well as the team played on Saturday, one girl stood out from the crowd. Lim’s six-under round of 66 was the course record at Springdale for women and set the tone for her championship performance.
“It was my best round that I have ever shot, certainly in a college tournament,” Lim said. “But I also knew that there were 18 more holes to go for that day and I was just taking it one shot at a time. I tried to do what I did in the first round for the rest of the tournament and I certainly felt helped by the rest of the team putting up good scores.”
Lim largely attributed her success in the first round to a little bit of luck and excellent putting, adding credence to the old Irish golfing adage that you ‘hit for show, but putt for dough’.
“[The secret to the round] was putting,” Lim said. “For me, it was just one of those days when anything I hit was just dropping. It was a very lucky day. I mean, I wasn’t hitting the ball very well but my putts were just falling every time I got up to the green.”
Lim capitalized on her first round with another excellent round of 72 to round out her Saturday with an overall lead of eight strokes. A comeback on Sunday by Columbia senior Michelle Piyapattra made the final margin of victory three strokes. Three shots further back in third place was last season’s Ivy Champion, Tiger Kelly Shon.
Outside of Tiffany, the rest of the team also excelled Sunday. The Crimson was able to add five strokes to its lead from Saturday to come away with a comfortable twelve-stroke victory.
To this point in the season, Rhoads has been emphasizing process over outcomes in training. Evidently the philosophy has paid dividends.
“We have been very much laying emphasis on process,” Rhoads said. “It sounds very simple but when it comes down to tournaments it’s about scoring. [The process] is what they need to do to make the scoring happen. So we’ve gone out and defined the things that are controllable that we need to focus on and made them our focus. It’s along the lines of the things we always say but we have made a stronger push to make us more accountable for those things.”
Appearing in their first collegiate tournament, freshmen Anne Cheng and Nina Fairbairn had strong showings, boding well for Harvard as it moves forward. Fairbairn finished eighteenth while Cheng ended the tournament tied for fourth.
“The freshmen have been very receptive of what the team has to offer them and are very excited about the whole process which is what we wanted for them,” Lim said. “Anne and Nina both had the game coming into the year so it is not unexpected that they played as well as they did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team played 13 sets over just two days in the second weekend of its season. The squad (3-2) headed out west to the Aztec Invitational hosted by San Diego State facing off against the host Aztecs (5-4), Southern Methodist University (6-4), and San Francisco (4-6).
The road trip was the first one to California the team has taken since 2006, facing a slate of opponents commonly considered tougher than their East Coast equivalents.
“This weekend was perfect competition-wise because the teams were just a little bit more skilled than we were in terms of having more training than us,” sophomore middle blocker Caroline Holte said.
As the Crimson broke in its new offensive system, sophomore outside hitter Kathleen Wallace notched a team-high 28 kills over the weekend and freshman setter Corinne Bain paced the team with 53 assists.
SAN FRANCISCO 3, HARVARD 1
Just a few hours after a five-set marathon with SMU, Harvard succumbed to the USF Dons in four sets.
Outplayed offensively in the first and second sets by USF, the Crimson’s attack unit caught its stride in the third set.
“[USF] was really strong,” Holte said. “That team was a lot of tall, strong girls who put up a big block that made it tough for our offense to break through.”
After three attack errors by the Dons and two kills by junior co-captain Kristen Casey, Harvard held a 13-4 lead.  The Crimson never saw its lead shrink below six through the rest of the set, winning 25-16 to extend the match.
But Harvard wasn’t able to catch up with the Dons, who notched a 6-0 run early in the fourth set. Despite the Crimson rallying to close the gap to just three points, 23-20, USF took the set and the match with a kill from their freshman outside hitter, Emily Reed, and a game-winning service ace from senior setter Mackenzie Murtagh.
HARVARD 3, SOUTHERN METHODIST 2
Three Crimson hitters tallied double-digit kills against SMU. Wallace led the pack with 12, while Holte and Bain had 10 apiece over five sets.
Harvard raced out to a 5-0 lead over its Texan opponents, and finished the final set on top, 16-14, despite the Mustangs tying the set three times.
“The reason why I love that match is because it proved our team’s ability to come back after such a roller coaster of a match,” Holte said. “In such a short game, the fact that we could persevere was awesome for our team because we know that we have the endurance to win the match.”
It was the Crimson who first took a 2-0 lead in sets against SMU, winning 25-23 in the first set and 25-19 in the second. Harvard tallied hitting percentages of .297 and .379 in the opening sets.
The Crimson couldn’t complete the sweep though as SMU rallied to take the next two sets. In the third frame, the two teams rallied back and forth for much of the set, with no lead larger than three points, until two errors by Harvard and a kill by Mustangs senior Maddie Lozano gave SMU the winning edge, 25-22. Another win by SMU in the fourth, 25-18, pushed the match to five.
SAN DIEGO STATE 3, HARVARD 1
SDSU handed the Crimson its first loss of the season in four sets, 25-18, 23-25, 25-20, and 25-15.
Casey and sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Shults provided intensity on the attack for the Crimson, with six kills each, but errors abounded as Harvard finished with a .098 hitting percentage.
The match was the third straight in which Harvard dropped the opening set. This time, the Crimson came back to take the second with key kills from Shults and Casey late in the stanza.
“We’ve been practicing running a really diverse and quick offensive system and it’s been definitely one of the things we worked on really hard over preseason,” Shults said.
SDSU came out fiercely on offense, with a hitting percentage of .347, including third and fourth sets above .400.
Aztecs junior Michelle Weber drilled a game-high 18 kills, while teammates Summer Nash and Emily Harris hit 15 and 14, respectively.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The change of scenery did not affect a change in results for Harvard men’s water polo. In a performance similar to last weekend’s, the Crimson traveled to play at an Ivy rival’s tournament, but struggled against top-ranked teams. Harvard went 1-5 at the Bruno Fall Classic at Brown a week ago. This weekend, the Crimson lost its final two matches on Sunday to post a 1-3 record at the Princeton Invitational.
Harvard (2-7) fell Sunday to Johns Hopkins, 11-9, and George Washington, 11-6, to round out the weekend. Harvard defeated a split-squad Navy team, 13-10, and fell to host Princeton, 14-7, on Saturday in the first day of action.
“We’re a little disappointed because we know that we can play better,” co-captain Will Roller said. “We’re still a young team, but all these guys are very experienced players. It all comes down to execution and that’s what we need to do to get to the next level.”
GEORGE WASHINGTON 11, HARVARD 6
In the Crimson’s final game of the weekend, the team continued its trend of sputtering offensively late in the game, as it was outscored 7-4 in the second half.
Harvard trailed the Colonials by three heading into the final period of the game, but was able to score only once in the final period as George Washington pulled away for the final margin.
A different team member scored each of the Crimson’s goals, with sophomores Robbie Fluegge, Noah Harrison, Ben Zepfel, and Blake Lee getting on the board along with junior John Holland-McCowan and freshman Dan Stevens.
JOHNS HOPKINS 11, HARVARD 9
Against the Blue Jays, Harvard could not hold a halftime lead, and fell apart down the stretch en route to an 11-9 loss.
The Crimson led 6-4 at the half, but Johns Hopkins found the back of the net four times in the third and knotted the score at 8 heading into the final quarter. The Blue Jays pulled away in the fourth with three more goals.
“We had positive moments throughout the game,” Roller said. “We had a very good first quarter, but we broke down and had trouble in terms of playing a full game. We couldn’t string it all together and play Harvard’s brand of water polo.”
PRINCETON 14, HARVARD 7
On Saturday afternoon, Harvard consistently lagged the conference rival Tigers. The Crimson fell behind by three goals heading into the half, and could not mount a second-half charge.
Princeton grew its lead to six by the start of the fourth quarter, and added another in the final period for the final margin of 14-7.
Freshman Joey Colton led the Crimson in scoring with two goals, while Harrison added four assists.
“We just had a few slip-ups and it ended up costing us the game,” senior goalkeeper Jimmy Field said. “Sometimes, we’d go down a goal and rather than adjusting we’d let them score again. From there, it would snowball, rather than us coming back and scoring.”
HARVARD 13, NAVY 10
Harvard’s only win of the weekend came in its first match of the tournament, when it took down the Midshipmen. Although Navy is the 17th-ranked team in the country, half of its team spent the weekend competing at the Bruno Fall Invitational.
The Crimson jumped out to a one-goal lead at the half, but then caught fire with eight goals in the second half to separate for good. Harvard’s victory was Navy’s first loss on the young season.
It was a balanced scoring effort for Harvard, as eight Crimson players found the back of the net. Zepfel, Harrison, and Lee, along with Colton and Stevens, each had two goals for the game. The defense did its part too, as sophomore goalkeeper Colin Woolway had eight saves and two steals.
The weekend was not all bad for Harvard, particularly with the win over the Midshipmen and the performance of the defense.
“We had some good ball movement, drew some ejections, and had some nice goals,” Field said. “Our defense plays full team defense and is very strong.”
But the Crimson must continue to improve, as it travels next weekend to face Fordham, Iona, and No. 10 St. Francis, which beat Harvard last weekend.
“We’re a young team, and it’s the beginning of the season,” Field said. “We’re getting used to each other, and we’re constantly working and making sure that we’re coming together.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team just wrapped up its first tournament of the season this weekend, but the Crimson already looks a lot like last season’s Ivy League-winning team.
Harvard hosted its annual fall tournament, the Harvard Chowder Fest at the Beren Center, and invited top teams UC Berkeley, Tulsa, and San Diego to compete as it kicks off its bid to win a third straight Ancient Eight title.
The tournament was not played in the typical dual play format, but rather in a “mock dual” format designed to maximize exposure to different teams and emphasize individual matches over team scoring.
“The idea is to play each match to completion, which gives us a good idea of how they went,” junior Shaun Chaudhuri said. “We want to know things we need to improve on, and what we did well.”
On Sunday, the Crimson played singles against No. 25 Tulsa, which fell to Baylor in the Round of 32 in the NCAA tournament last year.
“By this point in the weekend, we were all hurting,” junior Alex Steinroeder said. “But we all came out and played well, and I thought it was a very strong end to what was a good weekend.”
On Saturday, Harvard played singles against USD, and then doubles against Cal.
The Crimson was able to capture five out of the seven singles matches, all in two sets. Freshmen Sebastian Beltrame and Brian Yeung both easily captured their matches, and sophomore Kelvin Lam also cruised to a 6-2, 6-1 win. Chaudhuri, playing at No. 4, won 6-2, 6-3, and sophomore Nicky Hu took a 6-4, 6-1 win.
Only Steinroeder and fellow junior Denis Nguyen, playing in the top two singles spots, fell to their San Diego counterparts.
In doubles against Cal, Nguyen and senior co-captain Casey MacMaster, who are ranked No. 20 in the country, cruised to an 8-2 victory in the top slot, but three new pairings fell. Yeung and Steinroeder, Hu and Beltrame, and Lam and sophomore Nick Mahlangu all lost close matches.
“Saturday was another strong team outing,” Steinroeder said. “Everyone really showed that they’d been working hard this summer. No freshman lost a match, which was really cool to see.”
Friday’s action featured the Crimson against the Golden Bears in singles, followed by doubles against USD.
Harvard again took five out of the seven singles matches against Cal, who finished last season ranked 17th nationally. Chaudhuri and junior Henry Steer were the only blemishes on the Crimson’s record.
Nguyen looked strong in taking a 6-5, 6-1 win on the first court over the Golden Bears’ Gregory Bayane, and Steinroeder also rolled to a 6-0, 6-2 victory at No. 3. Hu, playing at No. 4, beat freshman Andre Goransson, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3.
Two Harvard freshmen also notched impressive three-set wins. Beltrame rebounded from a poor first set to take down Cal junior Nikhil Jayashankar 1-6, 6-2, 6-4, and freshman Andrew Ball beat Wyatt Houghton, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3.
On the doubles court, Nguyen and MacMaster again rolled to an easy 8-3 win, and the second team of Steinroeder and Yeung took an 8-4 win. Lam and Mahlangu won, 8-5.
“Friday was an impressive performance for our first matches of the season, especially after only starting practice on Tuesday,” Steinroeder said. “We were that strong against that good of a team, and we finished strong that night against USD too.”
Despite the impressive performance, the Crimson still has much to work on—namely, it must find suitable doubles tandems if it wants to repeat the dominance it achieved last year. While the top duo of MacMaster and Nguyen is set, the other spots are in flux as the team works its new freshmen into the lineup.
“I’ve been playing with Brian, and he has a really good doubles game,” Steinroeder said. “We had a good match against USD, and lost tight ones in the other two. If the coaches keep us together, I think we can be good.”
Still, it was a good weekend for Harvard, and gives the team hope as it prepares to get its first look at its conference rivals at next weekend’s Ivy Tournament in New Haven.
“It was really encouraging to see that everyone came ready to battle,” Chaudhuri said. “Our goal is to keep improving each day, and at the end of the season we’ll be leagues ahead of where we are now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Notching its first win of the season, the Harvard women’s soccer team edged out Long Island University Brooklyn, 1-0 at Soldier’s Field Soccer Stadium Sunday afternoon. The Crimson (1-3-1) dominated the Blackbirds (2-4-1) in possession as LIU Brooklyn failed to register a single shot in the second half.
“I think it was a really great result, a really great effort from every player,” co-captain midfielder Peyton Johnson said. “It was great to see the offensive pressure we’ve been putting on come through as a goal.”
Freshman goalkeeper Lizzie Durack saved one of the Blackbird shots in the 16th minute of the opening period.
The opportunity came when Durack passed into the LIU Brooklyn offense but she was able to recover and save a shot from freshman Tori Shinkowitz. The Blackbirds failed to tally any other shots on goal, with their two other shots going high or wide. The game marked Durack’s first start in goal.
“Lizzie had a great game in goal,” Johnson said. “We’re really lucky with the goalkeeping group that we have—we’ve got three, and any one of them can go in the goal.”
The Harvard offense also benefited from freshman talent, with forward Midge Purce netting the match’s lone point.
The goal marked Purce’s second of the season, the first of which occurred in the team’s home opener last Wednesday against New Hampshire in a 2-1 loss.
This time around, the freshman’s goal was enough to snag the win for Harvard.
“[Midge], as a freshman, has come in and not been afraid,” Johnson said. “She’s done a great job finishing her chances. A lot of other freshmen came in…and really made a difference during the minutes they played. Everybody that’s come onto this team has been majorly contributing.”
Purce’s opportunity originated from a long shot by junior midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby.
LIU Brooklyn goaltender Jessica Sexton deflected the ball, sending it to the feet of sophomore forward Emily Mosbacher.
The sophomore dished the ball to Purce, who placed it in the goal. Purce’s goal against UNH also came on a rebound.
“I think we were really encouraged by the goal,” junior midfielder Laura Aguilar said. “It was the first time this season that we had been up, so I think that kind of gave us an extra push…. We’re really excited about the win—we’ve been trying really hard and it was great to finally get a win under our belt.”
While the Crimson’s only goal came in the 37th minute, the Harvard offense tallied an impressive 18 shots, nine of which were on goal.
Notable attempts came from junior defender Marie Margolius and co-captain forward Lizzy Weisman. In the 18th minute, Margolius was able to get off a shot in the 18-yard box, but Sexton performed a kick save to prevent a score.
“I think after a few games of playing together, we were able to put the pieces together,” Aguilar said. “We played great games in the past five days, which is a lot without a lot of time to practice. We’re looking forward to training and working on things we could learn from these past few days.”
Weisman came close to pushing Harvard ahead by two goals when the senior shot on Blackbird goaltender Shannon O’Connor, who subsequently deflected the ball back into play.
When Weisman attempted another shot off of her own rebound, the co-captain got an unlucky bounce when the shot ricocheted off the crossbar and bounced right on the goal line.
“I think that against other teams this season, we had breakdowns for periods of time throughout the game,” Johnson said. “Today, we figured out how to come out strong…. I think in the first 30 minutes or so we weren’t playing our own game, but then we calmed down and started playing at our level.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team opened its season this weekend on a high note, finishing in second place out of a field of 14 teams at the Doc Gimmler.
The Crimson finished the two-day tournament, which was hosted by St. John’s and held at Bethpage Red Course, at four-under par 836, which was 16 strokes behind the winner Yale’s 820.
“We actually did really well”, sophomore Rohan Ramnath said. “Most of our tournaments are 54 holes, and we actually broke the school record by 20 shots. Scorewise, it’s the best we’ve done ever in a tournament.”
Joining Harvard under par were Florida Southern, which finished tied for third with Marquette at two-under 838, as well as Columbia and Temple, which finished at 839.
The Crimson started out the first round with a four-under 276, which put it in third place heading into the second round. But Harvard could not keep up with the Bulldogs, who jumped out to a five-stroke lead over Florida Southern with a 10-under 270, led by sophomore Joe Willis, who fired a tournament-low 63 on the par-70 course. Yale led the tournament wire-to-wire, and carried an eight stroke lead into the final round.
Willis also won the individual medal, besting 75 other golfers and posting a 68 in the third round to finish at 199 (-11). Columbia’s Brandon Jowers challenged Willis for the title, mounting a late charge with a 66 in the third round, but fell one stroke short and ended up at 10-under 200. Temple sophomore Brandon Matthews and Yale freshman Jonathan Dai tied for third at five-under 205 to complete the podium.
But the Crimson also had strong individual performances that propelled it to its second-place finish. Harvard’s finest performances came from its youngest players. Freshmen Kendrick Vinar and Robert Deng, playing in their first collegiate tournament, both finished tied for fifth place at 206. Deng, playing in the first position, shot a 68 in the opening round, and followed that up with two more strong rounds of 67 and 71. Vinar, playing in the fourth slot, tied for the team low in the first round with a 67, and then shot 68 and 71 to tie his classmate.
“The freshman lived up to their expectations,” Ramnath said. “They were highly touted and definitely lived up to it, they really led the way. It’s their first college tournament and they’re already off and running; it’s great. We couldn’t have really asked for a better start to the season; it’s a great way to kick things off. It stings a little bit to lose to Yale, but it’s just the start so we have a long way to go.”
“We’ve had a lot of previous experience in junior events,” Deng said, “and the setting hasn’t really changed that much. I understood the team atmosphere pretty well, and so there wasn’t too much of a transition.”
The Crimson had one other top-20 finisher, Ramnath, who played consistently throughout the tournament to finish tied for 19th at 211. He opened with a round of 70, and then shot 71-70 to finish. Junior Akash Mirchandani and freshman Daniel De La Garza rounded out the lineup for Harvard, finishing tied for 34th and tied for 50th, respectively. Mirchandani finished at 4-over 214, while De La Garza ended up at eight-over 218 in his college debut.
The Crimson placed second out of the four Ivies competing in the tournament. Besides the victorious Yale and the fifth place Lions, Princeton finished in eighth place, at 11-over 251.
It was a positive performance for Harvard to open its second season under head coach Kevin Rhoads, and bodes well for a team that returned its entire roster from last season and added several key freshmen.
The team will next play this weekend at the Windon Memorial, which is hosted by Northwestern and will take place at the Knollwood Club.
“I think we definitely played well considering it’s our first event,” Deng said, “but I believe we could do better. And that has to be with not all of us playing well all of the time. It’s difficult to adjust near the beginning of the season, but once we settle in and get in to the swing of things, we can see some lower numbers.

Things will be on the cooler, cloudier side today, with scattered showers and temperatures in the low 60s for most of the day. On days like this, prevention is the best medicine, so throw an umbrella in your backpack before you leave your room.

Punch season is upon us. From my extensive experience (La Vie accidentally gave me an invitation addressed to another girl once) I am more than qualified to advise sophomores looking to get into a final club. So here are some tips.
1. Call Your Meteorologist
If you want to impress at punch events, you have to master the small talk, and to master the small talk, you have to understand the weather. You can only talk about your hometown, house, concentration, and mutual friend Anne for so long. Eventually you will have to move on to other subjects: the weather. During my short-lived punch season I made the mistake of trying to talk about my greatest fear, death—but really I should have just stuck to describing a cloud that looked like Joe Biden.
2. Get a Cute Date
If you make it as far as the date event, you will need to have a companion on hand to prove you can talk to the opposite sex and to cover for you when you can’t figure out what politician the stratocumulus looks like.  Despite what you might think, blow-up dolls do not count. So you might want to bribe a linkmate to go with you. If you really get desperate, bring a prune and tell everyone you couldn’t find a date. Final club bros love puns, and dried fruit.
3. Buy a Yacht
It’s not necessary, but it’s definitely helpful—not just for punch, but for life. Think of how cool you’ll sound when you tell people you own a 40-foot boat with a built-in waterslide. Forget the P.C.; you’re on a boat.

You've probably heard by now that Former University President Larry Summers has withdrawn his name from consideration for the Chairmanship of the Federal Reserve. But you may be wondering why so many people at Harvard care, or perhaps you're just curious about what the Fed Chair does, anyway. You shouldn't have to ask those questions out loud, so Flyby's asked them for you here; and better yet, we've provided answers. 
First of all, what does any of this have to do with Harvard?
Although Summers went to college at the trade school down the river, he has spent most of his academic career in and around Harvard Yard. One year after getting his PhD in Economics from Harvard, Summers became one of the youngest tenured professors in the University’s history at the tender age of 28. In 1993, Summers won the John Bates Clark Medal, a prestigious award given every other year to a prominent American economist under 40 (and often called the “Baby Nobel”). From 2001 to 2006, Summers served as Harvard’s President, a role in which he oversaw a massive expansion of financial aid and the original planning of an expanded campus in Allston, among other projects. Summers is now a University Professor, a title given to Harvard’s most prominent faculty that allows them to research or teach at any of the University’s schools. As far as undergraduates are concerned, he's set to teach two economics courses in the spring: Econ 1400: "The Future of Globalization" and Econ 1420: "American Economic Policy."
Being the President of Harvard seems pretty cool. Why didn’t he just keep doing that?
 
There’s really no simple answer to this question, and, in some sense, it depends on who you ask. Summers resigned after the Faculty of Arts and Sciences scheduled a vote of no confidence in his leadership, which would have been a huge blow to the University’s reputation and stability, not to mention to Summers personally. The faculty took action after rumors circulated that Summers had fired former FAS Dean William C. Kirby. He also, in many faculty members’ eyes, had failed to defend himself and the University sufficiently against federal fraud charges related to economics professor Andrei Shleifer ’82, who still teaches in the same department.
While those two controversies most immediately preceded Summers’s resignation, they were far from the only clashes with faculty that plagued his tenure, which was the shortest of any Harvard president since the Civil War. Former University Professor Cornel R. West ’74 left for Princeton after he said Summers criticized him for activities unrelated to his teaching, such as making a rap album. And, in what has become the most infamous episode of his presidency, Summers made widely derided (and often misquoted) comments about the underrepresentation of women in higher education at a National Bureau of Economic Research event.
Wow, it sounds like a lot went wrong. How did he end up being considered for one of the nation’s most powerful positions—the chair of the Federal Reserve?
Despite all of the controversy, many believe Summers to be one of the most brilliant economic minds of his time, and his resume certainly supports that. In fact, his experience on the Potomac may be even more impressive than his accomplishments on the Charles. Summers sat on the Council of Economic Advisers in the Reagan Administration, served as Chief Economist of the World Bank in the early 90s, and led the Clinton Administration’s Treasury Department as both the Deputy Secretary and Secretary. After his Harvard presidency, Summers returned to D.C. in 2009 as Director of the National Economic Council under President Obama. In the latter role, Summers was heavily involved with Obama’s stimulus package responding to the 2008 financial crisis. And Obama is widely reported to like the guy, which the President made public when he defended Summers in front of a group of House Democrats in July. Summers’s defenders have rightly pointed out that, even though he wasn’t involved directly in the Federal Reserve, Summers has held several of the very highest economic positions in the executive branch.
Wait, is the Federal Reserve not in the executive branch? Is it not in the government? And what’s the big deal about being the chair, anyway?
The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States, created in 1913 by the Federal Reserve Act. That law assigns the Reserve what is often known as as “dual mandate” (which also corresponds generally to questions of monetary policy): low unemployment and low inflation. But its relationship to the government is a bit odd, even among central banks. (The Reserve’s website calls it “independent within the government” rather than “independent of government.”) Neither the President nor congress have direct control over its activities, which include targeting interest rates, supervising and providing financial services to banks and the government, and maintaining the stability of the American financial system. But the President and congress do get to nominate the Reserve’s Board of Governors, including its chair. Because the chair is the executive officer of the body that sets monetary policy, many consider him (or, perhaps very soon, her) the second most powerful person in the United States.
So, now that Summers is out, what happens next?
The White House has said that President Obama will make an announcement of his nomination this fall, which would presumably give the nominee enough time to clear the senate confirmation process before current Fed Chair, Ben S. Bernanke ’75, ends his term in January. Only the President and his team know what that announcement will be, if anyone knows at all. But many believe that it will be current Fed Vice Chair Janet L. Yellen, who would be the Reserve’s first female leader. Yellen is an attractive choice for many reasons, not the least of which is her extensive experience in both monetary and fiscal policy. She would also likely face a much easier confirmation than Summers would have, and many senators have already backed her in a letter to Obama. Dark horses are not out of the race, however—Obama has mentioned former Fed Vice Chair Donald L. Kohn as a possible successor to Bernanke—and it could still be weeks before Obama reveals his decision.
When he does, at least you’ll know a little bit more about what it means.
The Common App personal essay is the Holy Grail of your college application, but for many, the perfect topic is an elusive target. For those of you who didn’t spend your summer vacation staring at the Common App website, here are a few tips for where to start.
 
The Common App that the Class of 2018 will become all too familiar with is not the one of years past. One of the biggest changes affects the essay’s word limit. For the first time, the Common App will strictly enforce the limit of 250 to 650 words. Additionally, the 150-word activities and extracurriculars paragraph is now gone, so you can focus your time and energy on the bigger essay.
 
Take a look at the new essay prompts:
 
• Some students have a background or story that is so central to their identity that they believe their application would be incomplete without it. If this sounds like you, then please share your story.
• Recount an incident or time when you experienced failure. How did it affect you, and what lessons did you learn? 
• Reflect on a time when you challenged a belief or idea. What prompted you to act? Would you make the same decision again?
• Describe a place or environment where you are perfectly content. What do you do or experience there, and why is it meaningful to you?
• Discuss an accomplishment or event, formal or informal, that marked your transition from childhood to adulthood within your culture, community, or family.
 
Despite the significant changes to the essay prompts, Jim Montague, Program Director of Guidance and Support Service at Boston Latin School, said that he hasn’t changed the essay writing advice that he gives to his students. He still advocates early preparation during both a student’s junior year of high school and the summer before senior year.
 
You’ll notice that the open-ended question is now conspicuously absent from the prompt list. However, if you’re creative enough, almost any essay topic can fit under one of these prompts.
 
“The question that allows students to choose any topic will be missed. It allowed our students to choose something they really care about and write,” wrote Montague in an email. “There are still many ways to respond to these choices, though. Raising the limit on the number of words allowed is also perceived by students to be helpful and allows them to express themselves more easily and completely.”
 
And for those who still have no idea where to begin?
 
“Sit down with someone who knows you well and brainstorm experiences and interests that might form the core of an essay or a direction worth pursuing,” wrote Montague. Get a group of close friends together, bounce ideas off of family members, and don’t be afraid to get creative and express your personality. This is the only part of your essay that isn’t presented as a generic list of achievements, so make it count.
 
A few personal tips:
• Make the essay about you—sure, your grandmother was an incredibly inspiring person in your life, but college admissions officers want to hear your story and not hers. If your essay includes family members or friends, make sure the focus stays on you.
• Pick a topic that will allow your voice to show through the essay. Use humor, lyricism, or whatever awesome writing skills you’ve been honing for the past two decades. Insider tip: if you’re going for funny, have people read your essay and make sure your brilliance and wit translates on the page. There’s nothing worse than an essay that tries and fails to be funny.
• Keep a notebook or file to write down every idea you have, even if you don’t think you’ll choose it. Scattered thoughts can come together in surprising ways, and you may even stumble across a topic for another essay.
• Picking an event in your life can be dangerous territory if you waste a lot of space on describing what happened instead of how it affected you—just be aware of this pitfall. Show, don’t tell!
• If you’re stuck, take a closer look at the prompts and write down every possibility you can think of for each topic. If you’re still frantically searching for a topic, don’t despair; sometimes, it takes multiple rewrites and several dead-end topics to craft the perfect essay.
 
Good luck!
