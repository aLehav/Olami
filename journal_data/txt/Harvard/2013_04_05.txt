The title of “The Place Beyond the Pines” refers to no mystical forest haven. It’s no cryptic allusion either, but simply the Mohawk-to-English translation of Schenectady, a small city in New York. But writer and director Derek Cianfrance’s new film would lead you to believe otherwise. His style brings an otherworldly aura to this cinematic tale of crime and family, a sense that the seemingly small-scale events on screen are part of something greater. It is this distinct aesthetic, coupled with a diverse array of emotive performances, that help keep a sprawling—perhaps sometimes directionless—story feeling like a cohesive, often quite engaging whole.
Ryan Gosling, who seems to be everywhere these days, plays Luke Glanton, a motorcycle racer who spends his nights zipping around a cage in a seedy traveling fair. Cianfrance previously worked with Gosling on 2010’s “Blue Valentine,” and the actor’s character here is much more similar to that film’s Dean or to the quietly disturbed protagonist of “Drive” than to Gosling’s slicker, more loquacious roles in films like “Crazy, Stupid, Love.” and “The Ides of March.” The first shots of the film focus on Gosling’s muscle-bound back, speckled with amateurish body art of varying shape and size. The web of tattoos—indeed, one even depicts a spider web—mirrors the way the tough but reticent Luke is trapped by his mindless routine; however, when he reunites with an old flame, Romina (Eva Mendes), a life-changing complication arises in the form of an infant son he unwittingly abandoned one year earlier.
Suddenly overcome by a driving need to care for Romina and her boy, Luke leaves the circus in Schenectady and begins robbing banks by motorcycle to support Romina. She disapproves but can’t help succumbing at least a bit to Luke’s charm. Yet in the midst of a series of high-octane bike chases, the movie snaps focus suddenly—jarringly, even—to Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper), a straight-laced cop whose fateful run-in with Luke sticks with him for life. Despite having received much acclaim for his Oscar-nominated turn in “Silver Linings Playbook,” in which Cooper proved that he can bring both sensitivity and intensity to a role, he still seems eager to prove himself as a serious actor. This ambition translates well to Cross’s character, who is hungry for a promotion at any price.
As the story winds on like the twisting Schenectady roads, the powerful players in the film seem a bit short-changed. Mendes’s spunky spirit and emotional instability are convincing, but after the first hour she is relegated to gazing off somberly in the background. Ray Liotta is downright scary as a crooked cop in Cross’s precinct; he absolutely dominates his seven-ish minutes of screen time but vanishes as quickly as he comes. Even the central characters—first Gosling and then Cooper—fade away as the plot moves 15 years beyond them to focus on their neglected sons’ tales. In this way, the film cannot focus satisfactorily on any of its characters’ psyches; it comes closest in the way it examines Cross’s traumas and struggles against corruption, but it moves so quickly away from his story that this exploration feels shallow.
It is ultimately Cianfrance’s strong sense of style that holds the meandering film together. Small-scale drama is intercut with sweeping shots of Northeastern forests and Technicolor sunsets, as if to remind the viewer that the focus of the film is not the small machinations and contours of the plot but rather the landscape as a whole. Quiet scenes of romance and reflection are backed by a score (courtesy of Faith No More frontman Mike Patton) that melds shimmering guitar, ’80s electronics, and icy, operatic voices, creating an overwhelmingly ethereal vibe.
“We do what we do, but when we do it together…Shazam!” says Robin Van Der Zee (Ben Mendelsohn), Luke’s partner in crime. The two men find success by exploiting their individually narrow skill sets for all they offer, and Cianfrance, in a way, has done the same thing with his story. Each player, each individual event, donates a small but powerful piece to the whole; the parts may not satisfy, but with a little magic, the sum works much better. By the end of the film, the characters have faded to the background, and for once, style has saved lack of substance.

From the first strains of the floating strings and bells to the fade-in of the colored lights, the cast and crew of the Lowell House Opera’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” transports the audience from dining hall to library to forest. The music, lights, acting, and set design are so effective in creating the intersection of fairy realm and reality that they raise the question, as Puck asks, if the play truly is “no more yielding than a dream.”
This production of Shakespeare’s “A Midsummer Night’s Dream,” which will play until Saturday in Lowell House dining hall, uses Benjamin Britten’s original score. This year marks the centennial of the composer’s birth and also the 75th anniversary of the Lowell House Opera’s existence. The soaring music, performed by the Lowell House Opera orchestra under the direction of Lidiya Yankovskaya, acts almost as another versatile character, adding dimension to the play by underscoring the characters’ lines. Each actor’s entrances and scenes are marked by specific sound effects from the orchestra. Eerie bells and strings accentuate Oberon’s (Gerrod Pagenkopf) quiet yet overwhelming power, whereas the out-of-control, mischievous character of Puck (Joshua R. Wortzel ’13) is supported by the bolder brass instruments and drums. Bottom the Weaver’s (Matthew Wight) transformation into a donkey is accompanied by braying sounds from the wind instruments in the orchestra.
Though the set is not conventional, the scenery certainly helps bring the opera to life. Set and lighting designer Mark Buchanan converted the dining hall into a decorative library in which the human portion of the opera takes place, framing the elaborate chandelier—a permanent presence in the dining hall—with staircases on either side leading to upper levels and a white-washed lattice for the back wall. Costume designer Kristen Connolly accentuated the set’s collegiate appearance by dressing the Athenians in gear befitting university students, with blouses and skirts for the girls and jackets adorned with Greek letters for the men. However, as the opera enters the fairies’ domain, the front lights dim and colored lights illuminate the back wall, bringing an ethereal forest realm to life.
Stage director Roxanna K. Myhrum ’05 did an exceptional job blocking each scene, utilizing the unique space to its full advantage. Two characters central to the play are the fairy king and queen, Oberon and Tytania (Liv A. Redpath ’14), who are in conflict with each other over Tytania’s possession of a changeling child that Oberon wants. To convey both their positions of power and their antagonistic purposes, Myhrum frequently stages Oberon and Tytania in opposite upper galleries. The finally-united couples are placed at either side of the central chandelier, framing the play symmetrically at the end of the opera.
The performers weave their singing with a passionate commitment to portraying their characters convincingly. Redpath sings powerfully and authoritatively as Tytania. She embodies a stateliness and gravity in the fairy world but also a sudden love for Bottom the Weaver as a donkey. At the same time, Pagenkopf conveys Oberon’s power not through sheer volume but through a quiet force, mirroring his calm, slow-moving, yet intense voice with a smoothness and stoicism in his acting and his movements. His display of power culminates as he berates Puck for choosing the wrong Athenian to put under a spell—and thus causing the love confusion central to the plot—all the while staring straight at the audience as Puck lies convulsing on the ground.
Sophie Michaux as Hermia and Sean Malkus as Lysander, against a background of sweeping, romantic music, convey their love at the beginning of the opera so thoroughly that once Lysander is made to fall in love with Helena instead, the heartbreak in Hermia’s voice as she cries, “Oh! Lord!” is distinctly audible. Wortzel, who plays Puck, the only character in the opera without any singing lines, is outstanding at bringing the character vividly to life through his movements. As the opera progresses, he transforms from proper dress to a costume including war paint and a shirt tied as a toga. Wortzel’s cackling laughter and his wild, infectious energy as he runs and jumps from one side of the set to the other accentuates Puck’s character even when he is not speaking.
From the music to the lighting, from the set to the actors and actresses, the careful attention to detail present in every aspect of the opera creates a fantastic and riveting performance of Britten’s arrangement of the Shakespeare play.

A fun throwback to the bright and bold era of jazz, swing, and brass will open on the Loeb Mainstage tonight at 7:30 p.m. The Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of “Wonderful Town,” a classic musical composed by Leonard Bernstein, tells the tale of two sisters from Columbus, Ohio who make the move to the big city. Set in 1930s Manhattan, “Wonderful Town” is a coming-of-age story filled with large musical numbers and big group dances.
“A lot of the shows at Harvard in the past few years have been more modern, experimental rock musicals,” producer David C. Manella ’14 says. There hasn’t been a production of a Golden Age classic musical such as “Oklahoma!” “Bye Bye Birdy,” or “Wonderful Town” very recently. “It really has this heartfelt story to it, but I also think that it’s an excuse for big song and dance numbers,” Manella says.
Director Susanna B. Wolk ’14 is excited about the relatable nature of the plot. “Even though it is kind of old-fashioned...it’s still pretty relevant in that this is kind of an experience that a lot of us will be having as we move to big cities,” Wolk says.
The set echoes the excitement of the characters on stage, and set designer Madi L. Taylor ’16 has composed the cityscape in bright reds, greens, and blues. Wolk says that this aesthetic captures the enthusiasm of a person seeing the big city for the first time.
“I think the city is one of the main characters of the show as well. It has its own personality,” Manella says. Set in a particularly artsy area of Manhattan, Greenwich Village, the show brings together zany characters in a loud, happening atmosphere.
The production’s 17-piece orchestra blasts a jazzy, big band sound, adding life to a fun musical that Wolk anticipates will be a fun and joyful event.

In his most recent column for The New York Times, David Brooks added interesting insight to the inveterate psittacism of elite opinion in the so-called gay marriage debate. His piece, aptly titled “Freedom Loses One,” does not place a normative value on the progression of gay marriage’s inevitability as a component of American society. Rather, it looks at the institution of marriage as a whole and recognizes that such an institution is inherently illiberal in the classical sense. “Marriage,” he writes, “is one of those institutions…that restricts freedom. Marriage is about making a commitment that binds you for decades to come. It narrows your options on how you will spend your time, money and attention.” Matrimony, in short, puts shackles on human liberty and forces two parties to surrender their personal freedom to the caprices of the government. While Brooks does not go so far as to condemn such capitulation (he instead cites Burke’s insistence “that men of intemperate minds cannot be free”), this oft-ignored truth is patently problematic. As such, freedom fighters and gay rights advocates alike should address the real issue—the government needs to stop meddling in the contractual institution of marriage.
Marriage is most certainly an institution, as every defender of “traditional marriage” will go through pains to remind you. But of what sort? Social conservatives will say it is a religious one, and such an assertion would not be untrue. LGBT activists will say it is a primarily government-sanctioned one of societal import, and this reading would also be correct. In American society, getting married comes with a host of tax breaks and the right to take care of children. Then again, so do civil unions. It is somewhat difficult to eloquently describe the value differential between marriage and civil unions, with the current prevailing argument being the rather compelling one that gap between the two is based wholly on discrimination in a two-tiered system.
As it stands, the difference between a civil union and a marriage is really about legitimacy. As gay rights proponents rightly point out, same-sex couples in civil unions miss out on many unenumerated benefits of marriage, like the right to take time off from work to care for a family member or the right to sponsor a spouse for immigration. These inequalities don’t stem from inherent persecution on the part of the codifiers of the civil relationship but simply from the tradition of marriage in this country’s legal system. In other words, marriages are simply seen by the law as more legitimate than civil unions. Last time I checked, government wasn’t really in the legitimacy business; it is constitutionally required to be in the general welfare business. This business deals with the functioning of a healthy society and not intercession into the private activities of sexual intercourse.
Of course, the reasons for government recognition of marriage say little about sex between consenting adults. They are more technocratic, involving financial dependence and the compositions of households. This makes sense—it is in the government’s interest to determine how homesteads are operating. Yet, as it currently stands, people who claim to be “in love” do not have to pass any sort of test proving their societal interdependence. All they need is for their church to sanction them and the government immediately follows. This seems to be a blatant contradiction of the principle of separation of church and state.
Marriage has been under religious purview for centuries. Although social conservatives aren’t quite right in saying that marriage was born as a religious rite, it still stands as an institutionalized component in most belief systems. I don’t see the government issuing certificates honoring baptisms or confirmations. (Nor should they start!)
While religious marriage is based on the principles of heavenly love and eternal commitment of souls, secular marriage is obviously less philosophical. The government does not care if you truly love your spouse before God, nor should it. It cares only if you and your spouse have entered into a civil contract meriting state-provided benefits. And, unlike most churches, the government believes such a contract can be neatly abrogated through a divorce.
This is the key difference between marriage in the eyes of the government and marriage in the eyes of the church. Governments see marriage as a contract, while churches see it as a divine union. This distinction is crucial, and the fact that both relationships use the same terminology is problematic. It lends credence to the notion that a government is overstepping its bounds and regulating morality. In some sense, this is inevitable, as the government is bound in its definition of marriage by many facets of the church. By their nature, churches restrict the freedom of their parishioners, as they try to foster sound moral conduct.
The government should not have such leeway in its actions. Letting it issue so-called marriages allows it to regulate morality. This is not the stated purpose of a government-sanctioned marriage, but the shared lexicon gives it such authority. This needs to change. The government needs to stop dictating conduct and focus on the legal rights engendered through enjoinment in a civil union. The government is powerful enough as it is—let’s try to limit its ability to be sanctimonious as well.

At first, it was manufactured. Kim Jong Un’s brinkmanship on the Korean peninsula appeared an attempt to consolidate domestic support rather than cause any substantive change in the international system. Yet in a country completely closed to the outside world, his domestic actions have dominated the attention of the international news media.
According to a recent article in Foreign Policy, newspaper coverage of the regime has increased by 49 percent in the last 30 days, and web searches of the country have reached their highest point in over a decade, particularly in the United States. But the article also demonstrates the relatively large role of the United States within the crisis.
After all, North Korean propaganda and rhetoric emphasizes the United States, and, by extension, its allies, as the other great enemy along with South Korea. In a recent search of internet traffic, the only states that have covered Kim Jong Un’s actions more than the United States are Mongolia, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea.
With the interesting exception of Mongolia, all of these states have a compelling strategic interest in managing the North Korean threat. South Korea would obviously be the first victim of North Korean aggression. The Philippines and Singapore are both fervent American allies whom the Hermit Kingdom would most likely target soon after South Korea.
This also explains the differences in media coverage between the United States and the rest of the world. The majority of international news sources have analyzed the crisis in a regional context. Outlets such as The Guardian and the BBC have focused more on South Korea’s response than on international perceptions.  The American media, on the other hand, has justifiably emphasized US involvement in the crisis.
These developments show two different aspects about the current state of the international system. The first aspect is the role of the United States, now more than two decades removed from the Cold War that laid the foundations for the current crisis.
In those two decades, the United States, for better or worse, has maintained its position as the sole global superpower. But after a decade of entrapment in foreign conflicts and an unclear doctrine towards interventions in Libya and Syria, the United States still has not established its role as the global leader.
U.S. foreign policy simultaneously emphasizes both activism and restraint: faith in American exceptionalism to defend democracy and disenchantment with the requirements to actually do so. And the question of America’s role as a global policeman, whether valid or not, still lingers without sufficient resolution more than a decade after the invasion of Iraq.
The recent media coverage of the conflict has overcome these ambiguities. By presenting the crisis as our own, the media has placed the conflict within the more traditional policies of the Cold War. An ally of the United States at risk is equivalent to the United States at risk. Whatever the outcome, there is near unanimous agreement that the United States has a role to play against North Korea if war actually occurs. And it very well may not.
And this brings us to the second point. North Korea may be a relic of 20th-century totalitarianism, but it is a relic that has learned to manipulate 21st-century technologies.
Like his predecessor, Kim Jong Un escalated rhetoric and made blustering threats in order to shore up domestic support. Unlike his father, however, Kim Jong Un realized that the more ludicrous his claims or actions, the more he would gain from the international spotlight.
A manufactured crisis to shore up political support thus gained momentum through the international media. The more threats that Kim Jong Un makes, the more attention that he gets. The more attention that he gets, the more powerful he becomes in his own eyes, even if that attention makes him a punch line in the West.
This is the tragedy of North Korea. The benefits of constant media attention have pushed Kim Jong Un to continuously escalate the situation. But rhetoric only goes so far. At a certain point, he must take physical action, like declaring a state of war or closing a jointly-run factory. And eventually action reaches its end goal. War occurs and Kim Jong Un meets his limits, to the detriment of everyone living on the Korean peninsula.

Institutional change remains the resounding theme of public interest discussion across the country, including one conference during Harvard’s Wintersession. Ironically, the charitable organizations that address the effects of systemic problems create a collective barrier to this goal of institutional change. Nonprofits and charities were not created as permanent solutions to institutionalized social and economic ills but rather as mechanisms to alleviate suffering as reforms are undertaken. However, as the number of nonprofits has increased by almost 24 percent and charities by 42 percent in the last decade, broader reforms are largely missing.
I have explored a variety of nonprofit organizations from food banks and shelters to organizations providing education and medical care and, most recently, a group working to bridge the digital divide in my hometown. All of these organizations are addressing symptoms of institutional problems. The irony is that the more successful such organizations are, the less government is pressured to enact meaningful reforms. The more needs these charitable organizations fulfill in society, the more structural change is delayed. In effect, a flourishing system of nonprofits perpetuates the underlying causes of social and economic issues by meeting immediate need.
By no means do I seek to devalue the incredible work of nonprofits. They are, after all, the institutions that keep many families fed and diseases treated. What I fear is that if we continue to view and fund charity as the solution to our society’s gravest ills, we risk a deep-rooted and permanent mode of complacency. We risk the establishment of an unaccountable and unresponsive government. We risk the utter destruction of opportunity in a potentially burgeoning democracy.
When a mother is struggling to feed her children, many Americans see a local food pantry as the solution. In prescribing such an unquestioned and standard response, we risk forgetting what a travesty it is that in 2013—in the United Sates—people go hungry. A food pantry is by no means a solution. Even more, the existence of the food pantry detracts from our ability to see that the problem is deeply entrenched and multi-faceted, rooted in systemic problems plaguing education, development, subsidies programs, transit, and labor. Termed “a moral safety valve” by sociologist Janet Poppendieck, charity creates an illusion of a functioning system. It renders citizens and government more comfortable and consistently replaces public policy. Today we conflate addressing symptoms with solving problems.
Charity and nonprofits are bandages covering wounds. I hope that these bandages do not need to be completely stripped for government to enact concrete and institutional change. Conversely, I hope that these bandages will not turn us into a mummy of superficial alleviations to permanent problems. We must find a way to dispel the present aura of “everything is being taken care of.” No longer should municipalities see shelters as solutions to homelessness. We need real reform of our education, health, legal, and labor systems. For example, using technology-driven “flipped learning” to educate the next generation would require national leadership and financial commitment to expand technology infrastructure, include the internet in every home unit, and implement teacher training. Similarly, a national healthcare overhaul to control costs requires the government’s action rather than charitable funding.
Government that benefits from minimized accountability and institutions that benefit from maximized profits would like to maintain the current system, one in which institutional injustice is bandaged and poverty is normalized. The current model is effective in the sense that it is self-perpetuating and seldom challenged. In fact, many nonprofits are funded in part by the very institutions that profit from the inequities and social ills that underlie so much suffering in our country. We must break this cycle.
The focus of government should be to shape society and institutions that do not perpetuate poverty and injustice but rather create opportunities for people to realize their full potential. I am not calling on government to provide food for the hungry. I am calling on government to enact serious reforms and to shape a system in which mothers have the means to feed their children without a dependence on food banks. We need to eliminate the need for nonprofits and charities. We need institutional change. That is the true test of American benevolence.

Roundtable: Was Tyga a poor choice of performer for Yardfest?
 
This is the seventh instalment in a series of online-only Roundtables. This new content form from the Crimson Editorial Board seeks to present a diverse array of high-quality student opinion on thought-provoking issues.
 
Should Tyga Perform at Yardfest?
 
It is obvious that we won’t be able to get the artists that our peer institutions get during their spring festivals. Last year’s artist lineup was mediocre at best, and the student body deserves better. However, given the current monetary constraints the organizers face, I understand how our lineup is not as impressive as other institutions’. That does not entitle us, however, to lower our high standards of arts and ethics. It does not matter that apart from “Rack City” and “Faded,” Tyga’s prominence has been rather limited, as an artist’s fame usually is not strongly correlated with the artist’s skill. Tyga’s lyrics, on the other hand, are not only meaningless and misogynistic, but also his other commitments, which include a non-sexual role in an adult film, place him at the bottom of the moral ladder, and he should not be given a stage at this institution.
Even though we might not be able to throw “10, 10, 10, twenties, and them fifties” at artists to entice them, we, as a student body, should be able to get artists that have a somewhat stable moral compass and have artistic talent. We don’t always have to go for the big names. Student bands here are very skilled and should be given a broader stage at Yardfest. On top of that, Yardfest could feature cover, indie, local, and other bands that have talent. While we may not have gotten Adele, or Fun, we could have done much better than Tyga.

On the College Events Board’s Decision 
By now, I am sure we have all somehow heard of, partaken in, or chuckled at the war over whether Tyga should be removed from the Yardfest line-up. Whatever one’s opinion is, it is universally clear that things have heated up. Fast. But this is not an issue of diverging opinions regarding if Tyga’s lyrics are misogynistic or not. It is not even about whether allowing him to perform speaks to Harvard’s acceptance of “rape culture.” This is a war of practicality: Is it constructive to fight this at the expense of dismantling the whole of Yardfest? It is a matter of those who think fighting Tyga is worth the time versus those who simply “want to have a good time.”
I absolutely do not agree with the victimization of activists and the mudslinging towards those sharing opinions others might not find worthwhile. But I also do not necessarily agree with expressing one’s dissatisfaction with an artist by taking away from others’ right to enjoy the event and music if they so please. Boycotting can equally suffice as an expression of dissatisfaction. As I am largely ambivalent, I do not wish to argue but rather to provide the perspective of someone who has been on the planning side, one largely ignored in this polarized debate.
For the fall semester, I served on First-Year Social Committee (the freshmen equivalent of the College Events Board). While FYSC was not responsible for Yardfest, there are parallels in both organizations’ efforts to satisfy everyone when it comes to event planning. There is simply no way to please everyone, but we try. CEB tried.  Perhaps misguided, CEB’s decision to invite Tyga was in no way an act of closet misogyny. It was an earnest effort to invite a recognized artist whose songs most people probably have and can party to. Yardfest has long been plagued with the stigma of being “lame,” especially in light of other schools’ spring flings (Yale got Macklemore. The injustice!), so can we really blame them for bringing in a familiar name? And considering how little funding they typically get, those wishing for Beyoncé can keep wishing. It isn’t that this cause is not worth fighting for, but perhaps whom you’re fighting never intended to fight. And in this big social media mess, whom are we even fighting anymore? CEB? The administration? It seems we are only fighting each other.

Tyga at Yardfest and Misogyny in Popular Culture
The controversy of bringing Tyga to perform on Harvard’s campus reaches far beyond the internal bubble of the student body and the administration. I am in no way criticizing the genres of rap and hip-hop, but rather, I am specifically concerned with Harvard’s endorsement of the misogynistic lyrics that comprise some of Tyga’s most popular songs, including “Rack City,” “Make It Nasty,” and his cameo in “Bitches Ain’t Shit.” Not only are these lyrics hateful, but they also promote the objectification of women as sexual objects. I find this incredibly pertinent considering April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and the culture of victim blaming still largely pervades college campuses and popular media as a legitimate means of dealing with victims of rape and sexual assault.
By paying Tyga to come perform these lyrics on our campus, Harvard is condoning his performance and therefore his messages. Frankly, I find this to be a slap in the face for every student group on campus that actively works to change this rhetoric and the discrimination against women that it reinforces. I question what a “true” representation of the student body’s music tastes might have looked like had the CEB done more crowd-sourcing and outreach to a variety student groups on campus, including organizations such as the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and the Women’s Center.
However, this issue goes beyond the walls of Harvard’s campus. Tyga has a large repertoire of music, most of it innocuous in its representation of women, and some of it even favorable. This leads me to ask the question: Why is it that consumer culture has popularized his songs that contain his most offensive lyrics? For me, the controversy surrounding Tyga’s performance at Yardfest is less about him as an artist and more about the culture that encourages, and even rewards, objectifying and violent representations of women. I believe this is an opportunity to engage in critical dialogue about why this trend exists in society and what we can do to change it.
Kathleen O’Beirne ’15 is a studies of women, gender, and sexualities concentrator in Leverett House.
Recognition is Key
The facts about Tyga, this year’s Yardfest headliner, are well established. First, we know Tyga’s music has been accused of promoting sexism and violence, but they are not especially worse than some mainstream artists in the same genre. Next, we know that Yardfest is run by the College Events Board, which is restricted by a budget and forced to make hard decisions; no artist it picks will ever satisfy everybody. Finally, we know that student dissatisfaction with the artist this year is unusually high, enough to prompt the Office of Student Life to recommend that the CEB reconsiders its choice. What is the appropriate way forward?
I do not have the best solution or most representative opinion. But I do know that the way forward starts with a common recognition of an important point: The goal of Yardfest is to be both fun and inclusive.
What does that mean? Just because you have fun dancing to Rack City does not mean everyone does; some people will be truly offended. Telling them to just stay home is not a real solution, only a dismissal. Just as important, calling people who would enjoy Tyga at Yardfest “misogynists” and demanding that the artist refrain from anything offensive while keeping the event enjoyable for all may be an impossible standard for the CEB. Demanding that principles be upheld all the time has practical limitations.
Perhaps this point is obvious, but the discourse I have seen so far has missed it. Maybe it’s a function of how discourse has evolved that one side is too uptight and the other is misogynistic. Either way, the path forward starts with better recognition of the other side’s valid concerns and leaves behind polarizing language.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Thomas M. Menino, the longest serving mayor in Boston history, prepares to retire, leaving an impressive legacy behind him, we look forward to the potential for a new leader to bring a fresh perspective into a rapidly evolving city.
In his unprecedented five terms as mayor, Menino has become a Boston institution.  Challenging Menino in a mayoral race has long been considered a career-ending move—after an unsuccessful bid for mayor in 2009, Sam Yoon ’95, a former city councilor, left the city citing difficulties finding employment, which he attributed to potential employers’ wariness due to his decision to challenge Menino.
Even before Menino became mayor, outsiders in Boston politics have had the deck stacked against them—this will be the first open mayoral race in Boston since 1983.  This openness presents a novel opportunity for new leadership, new direction, and new policies to build, expand, and improve upon Menino’s legacy and redefine the role of the mayor in Boston politics.
Central to Menino’s legacy will be the significant achievements in education reform that have occurred during his time in office; however, inequity persists in the education system, and more progress is required.  Standardized test scores for 10th graders and six-year college graduation rates have increased, but third-grade reading levels remain woefully low, despite programs such as ReadBoston.  Moving forward, innovation within the education system and improving educational outcomes, particularly at the critical elementary school stage, should remain a high priority for the new administration.
A capstone in Menino’s fight for education reform was the historic decision by the Boston School Committee to end busing, taking the step that this newspaper and others had long been advocating.  Though we applaud this historic event, Boston continues to suffer from a dearth of adequate schools, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods.
Huge gaps in quality continue to exist between schools, particularly between the Latin schools and many of the city’s neighborhood schools.  While Boston’s wealthier residents are able to opt out of inadequate public schools into private, often parochial, schools, alternatives are limited for the city’s poorer residents.  We encourage the new mayor to use the neighborhood school system—and the budget savings that ending busing has created—to focus on improving access to quality public education for all of the city’s residents.
Elected to his first official term in 1993, Menino became the city’s first non-Irish-American mayor in over 60 years and the first-ever Italian-American mayor.  During his tenure, the racial tensions that continued to afflict the city in the aftermath of forced busing in the 1970s largely seem to have diffused, a change attributable at least in part to Menino’s presence and popularity throughout the city.
Still, shifting population dynamics and an influx of immigrants since 2000 have generated new tensions that continue to simmer beneath the surface.  During Menino’s 20 years as mayor, Boston has become a majority-minority city—according to the 2010 census, racial and ethnic minorities now make up 53 percent of the city’s population.
Though conditions in Boston’s largest minority neighborhoods have improved since the 1990s, significant achievement gaps persist.  Citywide, despite population gains, minorities continue to be underrepresented both in the workforce—which was over 70 percent white in 2012—and in positions of power. For instance, although Asian Americans have been in Boston for centuries and Chinatown boasts a rich history of political activism, Yoon’s election to City Council in 2005 made him Boston’s first Asian American elected official.  As rumors swirl about potential candidates to take Menino’s place, we encourage new leadership to prioritize measures that address issues of inequity and tension due to Boston’s increased diversity.
Menino’s departure marks the end of an era in Boston politics.  During his tenure, Boston has changed dramatically, and we hope the next mayor will bring an innovative perspective to face the novel challenges and needs of Boston in a new age.

Jason Alexander, the “Seinfeld” star and Tony Award-winning Broadway actor, wears a beige tweed coat low on his shoulders and speaks with a confidence that seems worlds away from his notorious television alter-ego, George Costanza. His teenage son, who accompanied him on the trip, chats with a few Folklore and Mythology professors in the adjacent room. They later tell us that our laughs were impressively loud coming through the Warren House’s burly 19th century walls.
1. Fifteen Minutes: You attended Boston University as an undergraduate from 1977 to 1980 but dropped out the summer before your senior year. What prompted you to leave college?
Jason Alexander: It was a combination of a decision and an inescapable series of events. I finished my junior year, and the summer after my junior year I did a film that ran late. When I missed the first two weeks of school, I called all of my advisors and they said, “Not a problem, but you probably should take a semester off.” And I moved to New York because I didn’t want to go back home. And then a series of things happened: I met the girl who would eventually be my wife and I was cast in the show that would become my Broadway debut. I just started getting work, and that’s when my college advisors said, “We’re teaching you how to have a career. You have a career. Why would you come back?” And I was very lucky and just kept working steadily and never came back.
2. FM: When you were young, you aspired to be a professional magician, but you tabled that dream realizing the need for a more lucrative career with greater chance of success. How in God’s name did acting appeal as a career with greater chance of success?
JA: No. [laughs] Well, a greater chance of success, yes, but it had nothing to do with lucrative—I was a very serious student of magic. I wanted to be a close-up magician, and I studied with a man who was profoundly good. He assessed me, though, and said, “You’re going to have a lot of trouble being a close up magician.” Whenever I try to palm a standard playing card you can always see a corner peeking out from one side or the other...I also have short stubby fingers, too, and you need long ones for coin manipulation. The observation was: this is not going to work for you. And by sheer accident, right after that revelation, my family and I moved a couple of towns over. And the first people that met me were the theater kids who were desperate for one more kid to be in a production they were doing. So that was my instant community. I had never thought about theater, I had never done theater before that. But that’s how I got sucked in. And I quickly realized that theater was in and of itself an illusion. It was just a different kind of magic trick.
3. FM: Much of the humor of “Seinfeld” came from the characters’ wild tirades about apparent trivialities. Would you say it’s made you more inclined to get frustrated about inane or petty things, or at least more aware of them?
JA: Having spent nine years with Larry and Jerry, I think I’m more able to understand what fuels it. I think the brilliance of both of those guys is that they can look at things that you and I look at all the time and they see possibilities; I don’t see those possibilities. I’ll give you the perfect example: the first time I really thought, “Oh my god, Jerry Seinfeld is brilliant” was when he did a joke about newspapers, and how relieved the editors of a newspaper must be when exactly the right amount of things happen everyday to make the paper come out perfectly, so that at six o’clock at their deadline, you don’t go, “Oh, one more thing happened,” and now you have a blank page with two paragraphs.When these guys look at the world and everything in it with the possibility of what’s odd, unusual, or funny about that. Or what are the things we don’t realize...I am more aware of what we think of as petty, inane, silly, stupid. I just don’t have the genius they have for articulating and making fun of them.
4. FM: How long did the new addition to the Guggenheim actually take?
JA: [Laughs] Well, my work on it was a one-stop thing. I thought about it for 10 minutes, wrote down my plans, and that was it. The rest of it took years.
FM: Thanks for that. If you had a dollar for every time someone made that kind of joke around you, would you have more or less money than the combined royalties of all the Seinfeld cast members?
JA: Oh I’m sure I’d have much more. If I could just be paid for every time somebody yells, “George,” just “George,” I’d be doing very very very well. “Shrinkage” would come in second, by the way.
5. FM: What was it like to sing the infamous George Costanza answering machine jingle given your actual musicality and Broadway-renown singing ability?
JA: It was extremely hard. In fact it took a very long time because Larry kept saying, “You’re singing it too well.” It became about how to misphrase it, how to breathe in the wrong places. What you find with singers, no matter where they’re from, if they have any kind of an accent, the accent tends to disappear when they sing. I couldn’t do that for George; his New York accent had to come through. It took about three hours to record that damn thing.
6. FM: What was Stephen Sondheim’s opinion of you when you worked with him on Broadway?
JA: He’s been very complimentary of me. In his book “Look, I Made a Hat,” it’s a review of his work on his own lyrics. He talks about his experience with each of his shows, and he has a lot of interesting things to say about “Merrily We Roll Along,” but one of his criticisms is that he thought essentially its one flaw was casting younger actors in adult roles was that they couldn’t really play anything except essentially who they are. “But,” he writes in that book, “with one notable exception, a very young Jason Alexander, who at age 20 played a middle aged man better than anybody I know.”
7. FM: So you’re now directing with LA Reprise Theater Company. I’ve often heard that the transition from actor to director is a rather natural, easy one. How are you finding it?
JA: Natural and easy and for me far more compelling and rewarding than acting alone, for the most part. Directors get to fire on many more cylinders than an actor. Even when I was an actor in training, one criticism my teachers had was that I should think about directing instead of acting because the best actors see the material they’re working on through blinders. They can’t see anything but their role. I could never really do that.
8. FM: What are you working on now with Reprise?
JA: About a year ago, the financial model that company had been built on broke. We knew we could continue to produce but we’d probably go heavily into debt if we did that. So we made a responsible decision to return donor money and subscriber money, stop producing, and go into a hiatus period of really reassessing the company. We’ve spent the better part of a year reexamining the mission of the company and the financial model of the company and finding a new home. Reprise used to be a company that just revived classic American musicals and now everything is on the table: musicals, plays, new works—it’s a completely different mission.
9. FM: If “Seinfeld” was just coming on the air today, how do you think it’d fare?
JA: Well, if it followed the path it went last time, we wouldn’t get past the pilot. The pilot of “Seinfeld” was made and dropped. “Seinfeld” was not supposed to go to series. But back then...if they weren’t going to produce [a show], they would find a really horrible spot like 10:30 on a Sunday night and they’d show a dead pilot. That’s what they did with us. And I may be wrong about which critic it was, I think it was the critic in TV guide, wrote an article that said, “Boy  that was a really interesting piece, I wonder why NBC didn’t go forward with that.” That engendered another look at it, and that engendered a very small pickup of four episodes, which is unheard of. It didn’t have a big audience, but the audience it did have was men from 18 to 35 years old. That was the demographic that every advertiser wanted, so they could always afford to put the show on the air even though the numbers of people watching it were incredibly small. That wouldn’t happen today. I don’t watch a lot of TV comedy, but there are two shows now, both of which are doing pretty well, that I think are offshoots of the “Seinfeld” formula. One of them is “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” which I think does extremely well. The other one is “New Girl,” you know: three guys, one girl. Stories that are seemingly about nothing, and with very unique voices and sensibilities that you can either like or not like, but the shows are doing very well. That gives me some inkling that maybe if we came on the air today with our sensibility we might find an audience, but I don’t know.
10. FM: Do you see the dwindling presence of laugh tracks in sitcoms nowadays as something we should be concerned about?
JA: No, I think it’s great. People accuse “Seinfeld” of having a laugh track. We never had a laugh track. If a joke didn’t get a laugh, even with a live audience taping, we put the live band on, writers would come out, get in a circle, and everyone would pitch jokes or pitch ideas. [E]very laugh on “Seinfeld” got a legitimate laugh from the audience. But sometimes you’re seeing one shot from one take and another shot from another take back-to-back, and if we didn’t blend the laughs with laugh track, you’d hear a glitch in the tape. I don’t even know how laugh tracks came into existence. It is such a bizarre concept. I guess it’s the carrot that leads the donkey. I’m delighted to see it go bye-bye.
11. FM: What’s all this hoopla about a guest appearance on the television show “Community”?
JA: Is there hoopla? Wow, I think its because you’re here at college. Apparently “Community” is the college show. It doesn’t fare well in any other demographic, but I like those guys; I think they’re great. They said we’re doing this really interesting episode where the cast basically becomes Muppets. There’s a plane crash and they land in the forest and they’re Muppets and my character is called the woodsman, but he’s a former alum of their school who more or less proselytizes life in the woods in a musical number.
12. FM: Well I’m excited. By the way, how’s your Pesach been?
JA: [Laughs] Fairly non-existent, we’re generally not all that participating, but thanks for asking.
13. FM: You’ve also been a prominent public supporter of the OneVoice initiative, which is a nonprofit organization that aims for mutual conflict resolution between Israelis and Palestinians. What prompted you to get so involved? What do you feel is your obligation to the cause?
JA: Just to narrow the definition of OneVoice, it came into existence in the early 90s and was created by an Arab-Israeli and a gentleman who was not Israeli but had done a lot of work in Israel. They realized through their business connections that despite the impression the world had about that conflict, that the vast majority of people in both Palestine and Israel were moderates. They sucked me in because I have been to that part of the world often. I’m intrigued and deeply affected by the people there, on both sides. My commitment has been ongoing, but it’s tough.... I think the extremes on both sides have done a very effective job of silencing organizations like OneVoice. I’m unfortunately a little disheartened by what’s going on there now.
14. FM: Given that art is often seen as a form of communication and humor a way of reconciliation, have you ever thought to use your art as a means to address such conflict as the Israeli-Palestinian one?
MJB: When I was last there, I had a wonderful meeting with the President of Israel Shimon Peres, and he basically said the same thing. He said, “Why don’t we use comedy as a tool here?” And I know he was looking for a funny answer. I said, “The problem, Mr. President, is that it’s called a sense of humor, not a science. There’s only this vague sense that this might be amusing to somebody, and that is too dangerous of a scenario in this situation.” Comedy in and of itself in every situation is offensive to somebody if they want to be offended. If it’s a blonde joke and you’re blonde, you could be offended. Whatever it is, somebody’s eccentricity or a generality is being tweaked for comedic effect.
15. FM: With that said, and stepping back a bit, what’s your go-to joke?
JA: Oh, it’s so wrong...okay. I’ll do it. It’s not my joke, and please remember that I was in the “Aristocrats,” so I’ve told the foulest jokes there are. But the joke used to be so interesting to me because, when I first heard it, the guy that told it had the room. I mean, everything he said was 100 percent kill; nobody wasn’t happy. And then he told this joke, and half the room was in hysterics, and half the room turned on their heels and left. It’s that kind of joke...there’s just something about a joke where half the people love it and the other just go, “You’re sick, you have a problem.”
The joke: What’s the difference between Neil Armstrong and Michael Jackson? The answer: Neil Armstrong was the first man to walk on the moon, and Michael Jackson fucks little boys in the ass.
And that kind of cleared the room.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91, chief operating officer of Facebook, told audience members in a packed Sanders Theater to be aggressive in pursuit of their ambitions. During the Thursday afternoon address, she promoted her “Lean In” initiative, a multifaceted public campaign which encourages people to support women “leaning in” to achieve their goals.
“Stand up if you’ve ever said I want to be number one in my field, I want to be CEO of my company, I want to be president of Harvard University, I want to be president of the U.S.,” Sandberg told the audience at the opening of the event.
Over half of the crowd stood up—the highest proportion of audience members who stood up to this question at one of her talks, Sandberg said. She proceeded to explain that she believes many people think they do not have the ability, skill set, or intelligence to do a job.
“I can’t change how I feel. Part of me is still the girl that sat in this auditorium and walked out saying, ‘I don’t belong here,’” Sandberg said of her own feelings sitting in Sanders Theater as a newly-admitted high school student.
The campaign to support women pursuing their goals is the topic of Sandberg’s recently published book “Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead” as well as the focus of Leanin.org, a global initiative connecting people who encourage women to achieve their aspirations. According to Sandberg, only 14 percent of executive-level jobs and 7 percent of corporate board positions in America are held by women. Forty percent of women in the workforce do not receive a single sick day, she said.
“For the 21st century, the central moral issue of our time is the oppression of women and girls around the world,” said Sandberg. “We have a leadership ambition gap, and until we fix it, we will not solve the leadership gap.” But some audience members said that they were unsure about the universal applicability of Sandberg’s ideas. Rachna Khosla said that she believes Sandberg’s experiences have been heavily intertwined with her privileged background. For example, many women do not have the option of hiring paid child care in order to spend time working hard in their fields, she pointed out.
“I think there is something in her experience that isn’t as global as she probably would want it to be, in terms of coming from a privileged background and having the opportunity to make those types of decisions where you could get child care and then keep working as hard,” Khosla said.
“I think those aren’t choices that a lot of women in the country can make,” she added.
Wentao Xu ’16 identified with the speech for reasons other than gender.
“For me, it was like I could especially sympathize with the disadvantages she had to go through,” he said. “I am an immigrant from a low-income family, so becoming a leader feels like all the odds are against me. But hearing her talk, overcoming that seems like a feasible thing now.”
Sandberg concluded her address by asking audience members to stand up if they could think of at least one thing they would do if they were no longer afraid.
Everyone in the audience, including Harvard University President Drew G. Faust, stood.

In celebration of its annual Islamic Awareness Month, the Harvard Islamic Society kicked off a series of events this week in order to bring attention to Islamic issues and the Muslim community at Harvard.
“We want to present this sense that Islamic values are very much a part of American life,” said Hassaan Shahawy ’16, who is HIS’s Director of Islamic Learning. “We have events that show that it’s not as dual as we think. It’s not Islam versus the West, Islam versus science. The misperception is that the two are at odds with each other.”
The festivities began Monday night with a talk entitled “What Muhammad Stood for,” presented by Lesley Hazleton, author of The First Muslim: The Story of Muhammad and veteran TED speaker. Hazleton spoke about Muhammad’s radical advocacy of social justice and the factors that led to Muhammad’s role as a prophet.
Shahawy described Hazleton as “an agnostic scholar and journalist” who offers a unique perspective on the Middle East.
“We wanted to give a perspective that’s from a very creative source, a very modern person writing about these issues,” he said. “We could have invited a traditional Islamic scholar, but we wanted to present it in a format that Harvard students could receive in a way that’s understandable to them.”
Like other upcoming events, which include a study break, a poetry night, and other talks on Islam, Monday’s talk was aimed at reaching out to both Muslim students and students of non-Islamic backgrounds.
“The more common questions people have about Islam or religion in general, like science and religious fundamentalism, those are the issues that we are covering in our next events,” said HIS Director of External Relations Omar A. Khoshafa ’16.
Shahawy stressed that one of the main goals of the Islamic Awareness Month events is to contextualize the confluence of Islamic and American culture.
“People always see Islam as a foreign phenomenon, but I find a lot of motivation for my American ideals and beliefs from the theology and workings of Islam,” Shahawy said. “I’m pro-evolution, pro-Big Bang, etc., because of my rooting in both American ideals and Islamic philosophy.”
The series of events will conclude with an elaborate Spring Dinner and a keynote address delivered by Comparative Religion Professor Diana L. Eck, who is also Director of the Pluralism Project.
“In us choosing her, I think the message we want to end with is that there’s a lot more in common than you think,” said Khoshafa. “There are things we can contribute, and we’d love to continue the dialogue between faith and non-faith organizations beyond these three weeks.”

As the U.S. presence in Iraq and Afghanistan winds down, a recent report by Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Linda J. Bilmes ’80 predicts that the aggregate cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan will fall between $4 and $6 trillion.
The U.S. has already incurred $2 trillion in direct costs for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, which began in 2001 and 2003, respectively. But according to Bilmes’s report, this figure “represent[s] only a fraction of the total war costs.”
Bilmes added that a large portion of the costs of war will persist despite the ongoing withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan that began in President Barack Obama’s first term. In the report, Bilmes claims that the “single largest accrued liability” of the wars is the projected future cost of providing medical care and benefits to the approximately 2.5 million Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans.
And some of these medical expenses will not materialize for decades, Bilmes said.
According to the report, the medical expenditures for World War II veterans continued to rise until the late 1980s, while those for Vietnam War veterans are still continuing to climb, even though it has been nearly 38 years after the final American troops withdrew from combat.
But what makes the Iraq and Afghanistan wars distinct from previous conflicts, according to Bilmes, is the utilization of an all-volunteer military force, which is more responsive to economic incentives like veterans’ benefits.
Bilmes’ report coincides with the 10-year anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, which began on March 20, 2003.
Although debate over the legacy of the Iraq War continues, Bilmes emphasized one particularly lasting influence of the conflict.
“This legacy is debt—promises and commitments that extend far into the future,” Bilmes said. “The years of conflict have left America still burdened with heavy costs, even with the ground combat phase drawing to a close.”

A recent string of top-down administrative decisions, culminating in revelations Tuesday that Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds broke faculty email privacy policy in authorizing the search of a resident dean’s email accounts, has faculty members calling for a broad reconsideration of their own governance and their role in decision-making at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
Specifically, they said, faculty have not been consulted on a range of important decisions over the last year pertaining to the Government 1310 cheating case, the relocation of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences to Allston, and a number of less visible issues affecting Harvard’s flagship professorial body.
“I think this only highlights a larger problem at this university between the administration and the faculty,” said Ali S. Asani ’77, chair of the Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Department. “I think the searches are just another egregious example of an overbearing University administration.”
Faculty members said Tuesday’s news that secret email searches disclosed in early March were broader and more involved than previously thought exacerbates the strain that perceived top-down governance is putting on trust between faculty and their administrators.
German professor Peter J. Burgard, who is on leave this year, wrote in an email Thursday that while the secret email searches are not directly an issue of faculty governance, they are similar in spirit.
“[B]oth types of action—breach of faculty privacy and failure to consult faculty—contribute to a degeneration of trust between faculty members and the administration: the email searches more blatantly and shockingly, the deterioration of faculty self-governance more gradually but ultimately far more devastatingly for the fabric of the Faculty and the College,” Burgard wrote.
Speaking at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting, history professor Lisa M. McGirr said that the monthly meetings have become something of a “spectator sport” in which faculty watch as administrators break news about their decisions. The shift, she said, points to a “gap between the administration and faculty over our sense of our rights and responsibilities.”
To help remedy this, McGirr suggested that a discussion of faculty governance and communication be docketed for the May 7 Faculty meeting.
Currently, faculty and administrators regularly interact in two types of meetings: Faculty Council meetings and Faculty meetings. The elected Faculty Council convenes on a biweekly basis to discuss items that might deserve consideration by the faculty as a whole at the monthly Faculty meetings. The 18 junior and senior faculty who are elected to the Council are expected to keep their eyes and ears open to faculty concerns and then raise those concerns in Council discussion. Council chair and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith can also propose items on behalf of the administration to be discussed at Council meetings.
The docket committee, a three-person subset of the Faculty Council, then decides which issues should be put on the agenda for discussion among all voting members of the faculty at their monthly meeting. In making decisions about what to docket, the committee tries to balance faculty concerns with administrators’ goals, as well as thematic discussions with concrete proposals, according to history professor Maya R. Jasanoff ’96.
But for history professor Charles S. Maier ’60, the Faculty Council has become too “routinized” to raise real faculty concerns for discussion.
Asani agreed, saying he believes the Faculty Council—and Faculty meetings more broadly—are too closely controlled by administrators for professors to have a free and full discussion. Rather, he suggested, the faculty should discuss the possibility of a new, faculty-only body where they can communicate and debate without administrative presence.
What exactly that new body might look like is uncertain, but faculty members said there is some recent precedent.
After a faculty motion to delay the Massachusetts Hall-proposed closure of the University’s Financial Planning Group failed last May, Burgard convened a group of faculty members to discuss the creation of a faculty senate.
With campus emptying out for summer, that group eventually fell apart, but on Thursday, faculty members said it might once again be an avenue worth exploring.

CORRECTION: April 4, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of junior and senior faculty members on the Faculty Council. In fact, there are 18 elected members, not 22.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Projects ranging in focus from mental health care for children in India to sexually transmitted infection prevention are among the eight finalist proposals for the inaugural Deans’ Health and Life Sciences Challenge, Harvard University announced Thursday.
Alumni, faculty, and industry expert judges chose the health and life sciences finalists from a pool of 54 applications. Each team will receive $5,000, the guidance of an expert in the field, and space at the Harvard Innovation Lab to continue to develop their projects.
Applications were submitted in one of four categories—the redesign of health delivery, changing behavior, computation in data and analysis in health, and stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.
“At the i-lab, we resource any student with an idea, but it’s particularly exciting to support student’s personal and professional aspirations to make a difference in the world around them,” i-lab Managing Director Gordon S. Jones wrote in an email.
Shana L. Hoffman is the leader of the finalist team CareSolver, which made an online platform that creates customized care plans for the elderly, instructing family and informal caregivers on ways to improve the health and wellness of older loved ones living at home.
Hoffman, a student at Harvard Business School, said she appreciated the diversity of the Challenge’s categories, noting that school funding is usually targeted at scientific research in a laboratory.
Other finalist proposals include a mobile application that allows users to share their sexual health information in an attempt to prevent sexually transmitted infections and an organization seeking to improve the pre-hospital system in Bangladesh by connecting users to first-aid and ambulance services.
The Health and Life Sciences Challenge is the last of the three challenges hosted by the i-lab this year to announce its finalists. The President’s Challenge for social entrepreneurship and the Deans’ Cultural Entrepreneurship Challenge announced their finalists March 25 and April 1, respectively.
All three challenges fit the mission of the i-lab because they combine entrepreneurship with social, cultural, or scientific innovation, wrote Jones.
Modified proposals for the three challenges will be presented to alumni, industry experts, and faculty judges in early May. The challenge winners and runners-up will be announced later that month.
President’s Challenge winners and runners-up will split $100,000 in prize money, while each Deans’ Challenge will distribute a $75,000 purse. Harvard will award the prize’s recipients residence and mentoring at the i-lab throughout the summer.
“The Challenges and i-lab are part of an institutional effort to resource students across the University so they can take their ideas as far as they can go,” Jones wrote.
Finalist members across the three challenges said they appreciated the opportunity provided by the resources at the i-lab to take their projects to the next level.
“It was incredibly flattering and humbling...being recognized for an idea that really has the potential to have big impacts,” said Andrew P. Leonard, a student at the Graduate School of Design and another team leader.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hotel workers, activists, and students gathered in front of Cambridge City Hall Thursday afternoon to protest what they characterized as unfair labor practices at the Le Méridien hotel in Cambridge.
Brandishing inflatable clapper sticks, signs, and drums, the protesters, who included Harvard undergraduates, chanted “No Justice, No Peace” in between delivered speeches.
According to organizers, employees at Le Méridien have been seeking a path to unionization for more than a year, but have been blocked by the hotel’s owner, HEI Hotels & Resorts. HEI, which uses investments from university endowments and other funding sources to buy, streamline, and resell hotels, has faced repeated allegations of failure to comply with labor regulations.
Harvard announced in spring 2012 that it would join several of its peer institutions, including Yale, Princeton, and Brown, in deciding not to reinvest in funds managed by HEI. Harvard Management Company President and CEO Jane L. Mendillo indicated at the time that the decision not to reinvest was rooted in “factors related to the HMC portfolio and its strategy and needs,” rather than as a response to criticism of HEI’s labor practices.
On Thursday, a year after Harvard’s move, protesters said their work in supporting HEI employees is far from finished.
“The HEI fight has been a long fight,” said Alex L. Chen ’16, a Student Labor Action Movement member who attended the protest.
Although the Le Méridien workers themselves are not unionized, the protest was organized by UNITE HERE! Local 26, a labor union that represents workers throughout Massachusetts, including Harvard’s dining hall workers.
Bob Boudreau, an employee of Le Méridien, was one of many who expressed his dissatisfaction at the hotel’s response to recent unionization attempts. He noted that Le Méridien employees wanted both an “agreement for neutrality on the part of the hotel” and “an agreement that they won’t appeal the decision” once provided with a path to unionization.
SLAM member Gabriel H. Bayard ’15 said he was pleasantly surprised by the turnout to the event, which organizers estimated at more than 400 people.
“The response has been overwhelmingly positive,” Bayard said.
Protesting students said they saw the rally as a small part of a greater struggle for hospitality workers’ rights throughout Boston and Cambridge. Some attendees called on Harvard to actively support the Le Méridien workers as they seek unionization.
“The Cambridge City Council already backs the boycott,” said Chen, referencing a unanimous vote in October 2012 that resulted in the city of Cambridge boycotting all services provided by Le Méridien. “Harvard should do the same.”
Attendee Matthew E. Stolz ’14 said that the organizers’ “bigger project” was working to help employees of the Harvard-owned DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Boston as they, too, consider unionization.
Last month, DoubleTree workers declared that they would start the process of considering unionization and demanded that Harvard grant them fair process to make that decision.

April 5, 1896: International Sports: A Harvard Man Writes from Athens to Urge their Support
To the Editors of the Crimson:
As a Harvard graduate and former occasional contributor to the CRIMSON, I trust that I may be permitted to trespass upon your space in behalf of a project that I feel a double interest in, both as a Harvard man and as a Greek.
At the International Athletic Congress at Paris last summer, it was decided to hold athletic contests every four years, open to amateurs only, to be known as the Olympic Games. If some lovers of Pindar feel their teeth on edge at this name, as applied to bicycle races and lawn tennis tournaments, we Greeks are to a man delighted that the first of these meetings is to be held in Athens, by unanimous vote of the members of the aforesaid Congress. And doubtless there could be no fitter spot to inaugurate these contests, which will be of incalculable benefit to the cause of athletics all over the civilized world than the land where athletics in their highest sense were brought to such perfection twenty-four centuries ago.
April 1, 1918: Start Liberty Loan Drive Next Monday
Following the participation of the Corps in the Liberty Loan parade in Boston on Saturday, a Liberty Loan campaign will be opened in the University next Monday, April 8, under the direction of R. McA. Lloyd '19. The drive will be conducted in connection with the national campaign which is to start on Saturday, April 6, the first anniversary of the entrance of the United States into the war. A committee of students has been appointed to carry on the drive and to solicit subscriptions throughout the University under the guidance of the manager of the campaign.
March 31, 1967: U.S. Oficial Says Ivies Reject the Handicapped
WASHINGTON, March 30—The United States Commissioner of Vocational Rehabilitation politely accused the Ivy League schools today of discriminating against physically-handicapped candidates for admission.
Mary Switzer said in an interview after her address to the American College Health Association, "I'm quite sure that Ivy League colleges admit a smaller percentage of handicapped students than other colleges. They are not taking the lead in this area as I think they should."
The Ivy League, according to Miss Switzer "takes a pessimistic line: the student should not be admitted if he will have too much trouble adjusting to [the life of] the college community." Miss Switzer conceded that there have been exceptions. "After all," she said, "Helen Keller went to Radcliffe."
April 4, 1980: In the Name of the Law
It could have been a courtroom parody and people would have laughed to see such ignorance. But it was a Boston Municipal criminal court and the drama was real.
The docket for April 3, 1980 listed nearly eleven cases. The eleventh case was that of Emeka Ezera '81, charged with "larceny from the person," arresting officer Pond of the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA), and Heins as prosecuting attorney.
By 10 a.m. over 160 students, faculty and interested persons had jammed Judge Harry Elam's courtroom on the fourth floor. The bailiff called out the defendant's name, and one by one the accused approached the defendant's box, either from the courtroom or the jail entrance.
