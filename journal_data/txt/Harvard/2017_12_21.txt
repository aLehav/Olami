After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last story of her debut collection “What It Means When a Man Falls From the Sky,” Lesley Nneke Arimah writes: “Girls with fire in their bellies will be forced to drink from a well of correction till the flames die out.” Arimah’s stories are full of such girls at every stage of life, who possess every type of fire. Mothers, daughters, grandmothers, aunts, cousins, neighbors, friends, lovers, enemies; love, jealousy, grief, tenderness, resentment, admiration, disappointment, understanding, self-loathing. Arimah renders each character with unceasing compassion, sparkling diction, and a wit that endures through even the direst of situations. She unflinchingly depicts the painful courses of correction her characters experience, while showing us that sometimes, albeit at tremendous costs, the fires find a way to burn on.
The twelve stories in “What It Means When a Man Falls From the Sky” are set in Nigeria, America, and a few fantastical realities; recurring motifs include the Biafra War, and various configurations of Nigerian and Nigerian American families. No matter the particular setting, however, Arimah places her characters in moments of difficult love, wrenching decisions, and seeming helplessness. In “Buchi’s Girls,” a woman who has lost her husband must swallow her pride to support her two daughters. In “Second Chances,” the narrator’s dead mother, whose last words to her were of bitter disappointment, comes back to life for a day. In the title story, a mathematician who calculates grief must confront the tremendous nature of suffering in a dystopian future where nations massacre each other for dry land. The stories abound with absent spouses and dead parents, estranged family and divided households.
The universality of the tumultuous emotions that arise in these situations becomes a prominent theme. In “What Is a Volcano?”, a myth about a feud between the gods Ant and River, Arimah concludes: “River’s grief was so deep it consumed [the other gods], and her grief became their own. …They tore the world apart.” The strength of this deep universal current, however, emerges from the narratives’ rich specificity. Arimah’s stories are first and foremost about people, each of which Arimah chisels into three vibrant dimensions through masterful description. In one scene in “Light,” protagonist Enebeli is summoned to his teenage daughter’s school because she has been sending love notes to a boy during class. Arimah writes, in a brilliant line of free indirect discourse from Enebeli’s perspective, “The only thing that saves the boy from Enebeli is that he seems as confused about the girl’s attention as everyone else.” Such a thought from a father transcends borders, cultures, eras.
Arimah turns her keen ear to a captivating range of voices and narrative techniques. When using the third person, she toggles smoothly between different levels of narrative distance while remaining anchored in the protagonist’s experience. In the first person, her characters speak with a candid, unpretentious, often wry self-awareness. Sometimes, as in the longer stories “Glory” and “Wild,” both of which involve agonizingly prolonged dinners gone awry, Arimah depicts dialogue and scene in precise detail. At other points, as in “The Future Looks Good,” the essence of a woman’s life is given in a single sentence: “Her grandmother, overworked to the bone by the women whose houses she dusted, whose laundry she washed, whose children’s asses she scrubbed clean; overworked by the bones of a husband who wanted many sons and the men she entertained to give them to him, sees her son to his thirteenth year with the perfunction of a nurse and dies in her bed with a long, weary sigh.” This command of language is further maintained from sentence to sentence, clause to clause, with original, evocative metaphor. An embarrassed woman walks with her “head bowed so low she’d have gravel and leaves in her hair.” Men dart in and out of a girl’s life “like a lizard’s tongue.” Infatuation “can flip, the turning over of a mattress to hide an embarrassing stain.” These little dazzling insights make Arimah’s writing, at the most basic level, an immense pleasure to read.
Individually commendable, the collections’ technical and thematic aspects culminate in the its most important characteristic: the way in which it implicates the reader in the tensions of every revelation and decision, every story’s human urgency. At all levels, from individual word choice to the curation of stories, Arimah demonstrates rich imagination and a fierce love for both language and people. Her characters span the whole bursting range of humanity; that they understand themselves to be fatally flawed makes them all the more understandable and unforgettable in their struggles against circumstance, the past, and themselves. There is no naivete: The characters often lose the battle, sometimes with horrendous consequences. But the fight, in Arimah’s hands, means the world.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard graduate students said they were relieved and excited after a provision that could have drastically increased their federal tax burdens did not make it into the final version of Congress’s tax plan for next year.
The provision would have repealed a tax exemption on “qualified tuition reductions” given by a university to its employees and paid graduate students. Many had feared that this provision—depending on its interpretation—would cause Harvard’s tuition grants for graduate students to be counted as taxable income. A tax expert estimated that taxing Harvard’s tuition grants would quadruple graduate students’ federal income taxes from roughly $3000 to $12,000 per year—over one third of their $35,000 annual stipends.
Though the tuition reduction tax formed part of the bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month, it did not appear in the Senate’s later version of the tax bill. And lawmakers decided not to include it in the final tax plan, which they approved Wednesday.
Multiple graduate students said they were glad the tuition reduction tax does not appear in the final plan.
“It was a very exciting news as my girlfriend and I would have been seriously affected by the new tax,” Jae Hyeon Lee, a physics graduate student, wrote in an email. “The new tax would have reduced severely our disposable income and left us feeling financially distressed.”
Other students said they were angry at the lawmakers who proposed the additional taxes for graduate students.
“I want to know what person thought of this so that I can donate my paltry stipend to getting them out of office,” graduate student John Froberg, who studies molecular biology, said.
The decision not to include the tuition aid tax in the final law comes after weeks of opposition from university administrators around the country. In November, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 criticized the tax plan in an email to Harvard affiliates.
“The resulting tax burden would be grossly disproportionate to the stipends received by most students,” he wrote.
Graduate student groups, too, vehemently opposed the bill, organizing rallies and phone banks to ask legislators to vote against it.
Dakota “Cody” McCoy, a graduate student in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology department and founder of the activist group GSAS Action Coalition, said the provision would have been “disastrous” for graduate students’ education.
“We hosted a big call-a-thon with the proposed graduate union, where we all just got together and just made calls, ate pizza, and told our representatives ‘look, this would be disastrous for our education,’” McCoy said.
Harvard Graduate Student Union-United Auto Workers, Harvard’s student unionization effort, also organized a series of call-a-thons and urged students to phone their representatives.
“Graduate students put up quite a fight across the country and a lot of that was focused on graduate student unions,” economics graduate student Justin Bloesch said.
Despite their relief, some students said they have mixed feelings about the bill’s passage. They said they worry about other provisions included in the legislation.
“One the one hand, it’s good because that means that graduate students don’t face a literally crippling tax increase, but on the other hand I think the rest of the bill is absolutely horrific for the country,” Froberg said.
The new tax plan, in particular, will levy a tax on Harvard’s endowment. Several students said they were concerned changes to the endowment might detrimentally impact graduate students more broadly.
“Anything which harms Harvard’s endowment negatively affects grad students,” Froberg said.
Bloesch noted the University is “rightly very concerned” about the endowment provision.
The endowment tax comes less than a year after unusually low returns on the endowment caused Harvard to increase graduate students’ stipends by an atypically small amount. While GSAS usually increases students’ stipends by around 3 percent, this year’s increase comprised 1.5 percent.

The tax bill Congress passed Wednesday represents the biggest change to the United States tax code in 30 years—and it likely means a major financial hit for Harvard.
The plan introduces taxes on the University’s previously tax-exempt endowment returns, potentially costing Harvard around tens of millions in added federal taxes every year.
Since Republicans first proposed the tax overhaul in November, administrators and graduate students have spoken out against certain provisions included in various iterations of the bill. Lawmakers scrapped some of those proposals, but others—like the endowment tax—made it into the final version.
After the tax plan passed Wednesday, University President Drew G. Faust issued a statement condemning the legislation, writing she was “deeply concerned” by the bill.
“We will assess the damaging impacts of this tax legislation moving forward,” Faust wrote.
The tax plan is now headed to President Donald Trump’s desk to await his all-but-certain signature. As Harvard affiliates—from top administrators in Massachusetts Hall to graduate students in Dudley House—work to understand and respond to the tax plan, here’s a brief explanation of what the bill entails and how it could affect Harvard.
The provision likely to have the biggest impact on Harvard is the new tax on private colleges with endowments over $500,000 per full time student. Harvard is one of 35 institutions that falls into this category, meaning it will have to pay  a 1.4 percent tax on its endowment returns every year.
Faust previously estimated that, if the plan had taken effect in fiscal year 2017, the University would have had to pay nearly $43 million to the federal government.
A second provision with potentially large consequences for Harvard, however, did not make it into the final version of the bill. The tax plan Congress passed Wednesday does not repeal a tax exemption for “qualified tuition deductions” for graduate students, meaning graduate students will not have to pay significant additional taxes under the new plan.
Faust said in November that federal taxes on university endowments would be a “blow at the strength of American higher education” and would diminish Harvard’s ability to provide research funding and financial aid.
The new tax on Harvard’s endowment returns comes at a time when the University posted 8.1 percent endowment growth in fiscal year 2017, the lowest rate of growth among Ivy League schools.
Brad R. Balter, a managing partner of Balter Capital Management, said he thinks it will be difficult for Harvard to find loopholes around the new tax on endowment returns without facing public backlash. As a result, Harvard’s investment strategy is likely to change, he said.
A spokesperson from Harvard Management Company, which stewards Harvard’s endowment, declined to comment for this story.
The bill is unlikely to significantly affect Harvard’s graduate students in any way.
The bill originally contained a provision that suggested treating graduate students’ tuition wavers as taxable income. This proposal—which generated alarm on Harvard’s campus and across the country—could have quadrupled taxes for graduate students.
That provision did not make it into the plan passed Wednesday, however. In wake of the bill’s passing, several graduate students said they felt relieved by the final version of the tax plan.
In a statement soon after the bill passed Wednesday, Faust wrote she was “deeply concerned” by the new legislation—in particular, by the new tax on endowment returns.
“The provision will constrain the resources that enable us to provide the financial aid that makes college more affordable and accessible and to undertake the inquiries that yield discoveries, cures, innovation and economic growth,” Faust wrote.
She added, though, that she was glad to see “adjustments” in the final tax bill, in part referencing the preservation of tax-free tuition for graduate students.
Prior to the bill’s passage, administrators criticized the legislation and argued students’ tuition waivers should not be counted as taxable income. In an email sent to students in November, University Provost Alan M. Garber ’77 warned the bill would “broadly reduce benefits that support higher education.” He called the “tax burden” the bill would impose on graduate students “grossly disproportionate” to their stipends and sharply criticized the endowment tax.
Faust, too, took up the fight, making several trips to Washington to personally defend Harvard’s tax-free endowment, meeting with legislators like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to urge them to oppose the plan.
But her efforts bore little fruit. On Wednesday, Faust wrote the University will closely monitor the impact of the tax plan going forward.
It's unclear when the bill will become law, since Trump may delay signing the bill until the start of 2018 in order to buy time for Congress to address automatic spending cuts the bill would trigger.
Regardless of whether he signs the bill in the final days of this year or the first days of the next, the plan will take effect for the 2018 fiscal year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: December 24, 2017 at 1:40 p.m.
Longtime Harvard donor and journalist Win McCormack ’67, the owner and editor-in-chief of the New Republic, has endowed a new professorship at the Harvard Kennedy School in an attempt to ultimately improve political discourse across the nation.
Archon Fung, the academic dean of the Kennedy School, will be the first person to hold this position, formally titled the Winthrop Laflin McCormack Professorship of Citizenship and Self-Government. Fung, who joined the Kennedy School faculty in 1999, currently serves as the Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Citizenship. His research focuses on democratic governance.
The Kennedy School announced McCormack’s endowment of the position in a press release Monday. In the release, McCormack said he hopes the new position will help to foster a political environment at the University—and in the United States—that promotes civil discourse across party lines.
In an interview Friday, McCormack said he thinks the endowed professorship is especially needed given the current political climate in the country.
"The Constitution was set up to acquire consensus and compromise, and we have a political party that currently rejects the idea of consensus and trying to reach consensus and compromise," he said. "That would be the Republican party."
While at Harvard, McCormack studied Government and lived in Kirkland House. He graduated cum laude.
In an interview Wednesday, Fung said he is thrilled to assume the professorship and that he thinks this endowment will greatly aid his future research. Fung said McCormack’s gift will allow him and his colleagues at the Kennedy School to more effectively examine democratic policies and institutions around the world.
Fung also said he thinks this endowment marks a sign of support for the entire Kennedy School and its mission.
“A lot of philanthropists these days in foundations and private philanthropy are more eager to fund specific project work that feels more like an investment that they could see a return on in the next year, whereas endowing a professorship is a different proposition,” Fung said. “[University President Drew G.] Faust puts it this way: It’s much more belief in the mission and purposes of the institution, rather than a transactional thing.”
McCormack’s endowment comes at a time when it is “especially important” to be researching democracy, Fung said. He pointed, in particular, to the current political environment in the United States, as well as in Western Europe.
He said that, though he thinks there used to be a broad consensus around what constituted “center-left and center-right values” in the United States and Europe, he thinks that—across the past two years—political triumphs achieved by people he called “insurgents” have upset that balance.
“What we’ve seen in the last year or two in Europe and the United States and other places—but especially in Europe and the United States—is the unexpected political victories of insurgents who upset the center-left and center-right political parties and politicians,” Fung said.
In the press release, Douglas W. Elmendorf, the dean of the Kennedy School, broadly agreed. Elmendorf said he hopes McCormack’s gift will help remedy what he called a current lack of consensus in domestic politics.
“Dysfunction in the United States and elsewhere has made it more difficult for policymakers to address our challenges in a constructive fashion, and progress toward democratic governance has stalled in many regions of the world,” Elmendorf said in the release. “Mr. McCormack’s generosity will allow Harvard Kennedy School to redouble our efforts to improve the effectiveness of democracy around the world.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Kyle Juszczyk ’13 is headed back to the NFL’s Pro Bowl. This time, the former Crimson and current San Francisco 49er has earned a spot as the NFC’s starting fullback.
Juszczyk appeared in his first pro bowl last season as a member of the Baltimore Ravens. In that game, the fullback caught five passes for 43 yards as part of the AFC squad’s 20-13 victory. He also tacked on eight rushing yards on three handoffs.
After four seasons with the Ravens, Juszczyk headed to the Bay Area this offseason to join the 49ers on what could end up being a four year deal, depending on team options.
In his first season with San Francisco, the fullback has caught 24 passes for 220 yards and one touchdown to go along with 31 rushing yards. Juszczyk has appeared in 12 games this year, nine of which he started. He is also nearing 1000 career receiving yards, as he has racked up 989 over the course of nearly five years.
Before joining the professional ranks, Juszczyk was a two-time All-American at the tight end/halfback position in coach Tim Murphy’s offense. He also garnered three All-Ivy League selections while at Harvard.
Juszczyk is the Crimson’s all-time leader among tight ends in  receiving yards, receptions, and touchdown receptions. His career marks of 1,576 receiving yards, 125 catches, and 22 receiving touchdowns rank seventh, sixth, and third all-time, respectively, among all Harvard players.
The only other Harvard football alumnus to appear in multiple Pro Bowls is Matt Birk ’98. Birk, who earned six Pro Bowl selections, played 14 seasons as a center for the Minnesota Vikings and the Baltimore Ravens.
Juszczyk is one of over 30 former Harvard football players to play in the NFL. Currently, he is joined by Cam Brate, Nick Easton, Ryan Fitzpatrick, and Tyler Ott.
The Pro Bowl, the NFL’s yearly All-Star game, will be played on Jan. 28 at Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Fla.
