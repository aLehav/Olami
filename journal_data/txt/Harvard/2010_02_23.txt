“Dear God, I Hate Myself,” the new album by Xiu Xiu, refuses to be classified. Just like the group’s previous albums, their seventh release is influenced by everything from noise to indie rock, but manages to blend these sounds in a unique way. Though “Dear God, I Hate Myself” can be difficult to listen to, the innovation and power of the album is undeniable.
Lead singer and songwriter Jamie Stewart arranges his music to prod and engage listeners. Underneath Stewart’s vocals—which alternatively whimper, sing, and shout—layers of instrumentation and programming juxtapose guitars, drums, a banjo, a cello, and synthesizers, among other noisemakers. “Apple for a Brain” is composed particularly with provocation in mind, its bouncing beats and chirping drums suddenly giving away after two minutes into what seems like a completely different song. This is far from an isolated example of the group disregarding musical conventions—just one of the reasons why “Dear God” is far from accessible.
The torment within the album’s lyrics is similarly troubling, and made obvious right from the start. The very first words of opener “Gray Death”—“Beat, beat me to death”—quickly establishes the album’s grim mood. The most biting song on the album, “Chocolate Makes You Happy,” is also one of the most surprising. Neither its title nor its relatively simple melody hints at its lyrical perversity: “Chocolate makes you happy / And it keeps you awake / As you unbutton your top pants button / Bewildered by the pain.” The song then moves from a seeming indictment of sweet-toothed hedonism to a depiction of the torment of an eating disorder.
Driven by a guitar and a snare drum, the title track is the most conventional and catchy of the dozen songs on “Dear God.” There’s a fascinating incongruity between the bleakness of the refrain and its catchiness, as though Stewart wants listeners to sing, “Dear God, I hate myself,” without realizing quite what they’re saying. Additionally, the title track’s rhythms are thoroughly danceable. An underlying, distorted hand-clap beat, is accompanied by emphatically-strummed guitar. Both occasionally spiral into seemingly extemporaneous electronic interludes, but the base beat always returns. The meter brings to mind the driving compositions of New Order, whose music has been influential on Xiu Xiu’s development.
As the foot-tapping rhythms of the title track demonstrate, “Dear God, I Hate Myself,” continues the band’s habit of making songs that shout and lament over a din of schizophrenic, yet somehow coherent compositions. But the band also continues to experiment, as on the song “Cumberland Gap,” where the twanging of a banjo surprises listeners as it accompanies Stewart’s vocals, both moving over the same notes in unison. The song is a reworking of a famous folk tune named for a pass in the Appalachian Tennessee, an origin which reveals another of the group’s diverse influences: bluegrass music. Though it’s the shortest song, “Cumberland Gap” stands out as one of the album’s shining moments.
“Dear God, I Hate Myself,” for all its pain and aggression, seems like a sort of purgation. Stewart opens the floodgates, rapidly pouring out all his anguish, then ends his songs just as the trickle of emotion falters. There are no songs longer than four minutes, as Stewart avoids allowing his message to dilute into thin, drawn out tracks. Though this can be overwhelming, it is also somewhat cathartic and gives the feeling of healing through expression. Xiu Xiu’s risk-taking and continued diversity of influence add another layer of interest to a fascinating album. While certainly not easy to listen to, “Dear God” proves that Xiu Xiu are doing their best to turn what seems to be a potentially destabilizing pain to very productive ends.

Martin Scorsese has made a habit of crafting films that employ genre tropes to illuminate the human condition. From “Raging Bull,” the sports movie that focused on the violent imperfections of human nature, to “The Departed,” a police procedural/gangland thriller that studied loyalty, betrayal, and identity in a disconcertingly harsh light, he has always found a way to push past the cliché, the obvious, and the mundane. With “Shutter Island,” Scorsese turns his attention to a new genre: the psychological thriller. A mind-bending, atmospheric film with a couple of vertigo-inducing twists and turns, “Shutter Island” nonetheless fails make a deeper statement in typical Scorsese fashion, and suffers for it.
Starring Scorsese regular Leonardo DiCaprio as the righteous but troubled federal marshal Teddy Daniels, the film is set in a hospital for the criminally insane off the coast of Massachusetts. A patient has recently escaped—“evaporated straight through the walls,” according to Dr. John Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley—and Daniels and a partner are sent to investigate. Of course, the story proves to be far more complicated and includes a number of subplots such as a revenge mission on behalf of DiCaprio’s murdered wife, and the ever-deepening suspicions that the hospital is more sinister than it appears.
From the opening, mist-shrouded shot, Scorsese sets a moody, foreboding tone. A score of crashing, discordant strings and staccato horns underpins a visual palette of slate grey and brown, only interrupted for several disconcertingly Technicolor hallucinatory sequences. Scorsese has ever been a master of setting the tone—see, for example, the perfectly balanced grime and gaudiness of “Goodfellas”—and “Shutter Island” is no exception.
The acting is similarly excellent. DiCaprio, who continues to grow as an actor under Scorsese’s tutelage, turns in one of his more powerful performances. Though his character may seem to fall into the standard trope of a hardened hero plauged by a traumatic past, DiCaprio effectively portrays Daniels’ spiraling instability as his perception of the world grows more uncertain. Meanwhile, Kingsley and the rest of the hospital staff exude a menacing solidarity that complements the film’s sinister audiovisual elements perfectly.
All that remains, then, is to mould these disparate elements around a central narrative. And this is where the film runs into trouble. The movie is based on Dennis Lehane’s novel which should have served as fertile ground for Scorsese to build a genre classic on, but instead “Shutter Island” stumbles into a forest of clichés. The first warning sign comes when the captain of DiCaprio’s ferry to the island requests that the marshals make their way ashore quickly. Asked why, he glances at the roiling grey sky and pronounces: “storm’s coming.”
There are far too many similar incidents—well-worn visual tricks like the slow, spinning reveal of a chair’s occupant, DiCaprio ludicrously sensing the presence of his wife’s supposed murderer by stating, “I can feel him,” and so forth. These jarringly trite moments punctuate “Shutter Island,” to the extent that it ends up feeling more than a little stale.
Attempts at the type of overarching themes that usually elevate Scorsese’s films are disappointingly cursory. Daniels’ violent tendencies lead only to a brief meditation—“God loves violence…it’s what we are,” declares the hospital Warden, musing on humanity—a mere shadow of Jake LaMotta’s trials in “Raging Bull.” Scorsese dabbles with a few bigger ideas, but never latches onto something really worth saying.
All that remains, then, is that final twist, the one guaranteed component of any film of this genre. “Shutter Island” pulls it off convincingly, in a heart-wrenching though overlong series of revelations which will leave even the most prepared audience members reeling.
It isn’t enough. As a pure-and-simple psychological thriller, “Shutter Island” should be lauded. It has all the necessary ingredients: a consistently dark tone, emotionally powerful reveals, and mind-bending twists aplenty. And from any other director, that might be enough to satisfy. But from Martin Scorsese, we have come to expect something more. We expect a coherent and thought-provoking message. We expect great ideas, new innovations, broken boundaries. We expect, in short, a film that is different, one that will stay with us well past the final fade-to-black. And it is this essential point where “Shutter Island” is found lacking. It is competent, but also vaguely utilitarian—fun while it lasts, but slight in lasting impact. And that, from Scorsese, is simply inadequate.                                                                              —Staff writer Daniel K.

“You have to be subtle with the comedy in movies,” says Craig Robinson, who plays warehouse manager Darryl on NBC’s “The Office” and has starred in films such as “Knocked Up.” This sentiment is somewhat surprising, however, given the over-the-top nature of his upcoming film, “Hot Tub Time Machine.”
Slated for release on March 26, “Hot Tub Time Machine” promises to give audiences a unique comedy experience. As the movie’s title implies, the plot concerns a hot tub which possesses the unique ability to transport its users through time and space. The movie begins when four friends—three middle aged men, Adam, Lou, and Nick, (John Cusack, Rob Corddry, and Robinson respectively) and their younger, introverted, and videogame addicted friend, Jacob, (Clark Duke)travel to the ski lodge of their childhoods in order to escape from the grind of their adult lives. The trip is initially a disappointment; however, after a night of heavy drinking in a hot tub, the four awake to find themselves transported through time to the year 1986. The group is then presented with the exceptional opportunity to remake their lives with the knowledge of their future still present in their minds.
The outlandish plot offers the characters the chance to confront unique and hilarious situations as they try to “kick some past,” as the film’s tagline states. The cast acknowledges, for example, that little heed is paid to the theoretical laws of time travel in the movie. When asked about how the hot tub is able to travel through time, Duke, of “Greek” and “Superbad” fame, says, “There is little to no explanation.”
The 1986 world in which the four men have landed is also a bit of a shock, though younger audiences will not have trouble keeping up. Duke says that the film “is not like a Ken Burns documentary about the eighties. You’ll be able to keep up, I promise.” Robinson, in turn, believes that audiences will love the feel of the movie as they will, “get to take a trip back,” and “see the ridiculousness of the hairstyles and fashions.”
Some critics, however, have speculated that the movie’s plot and premise are thoughtless and juvenile, while others claim that the movie will attempt to ride on the coattails of other successful crude comedies such as “The Hangover.” But though the movie’s comedy may not be overly refined, Robinson assures that “people will be surprised by how clever [the movie] is. There’s a lot of good in there.”
Calling the movie a knockoff of “The Hangover” may also be a bit unfair. Though both movies recount the tales of four men who take a trip to get away from their average lives, Robinson claims that “the only similarity [between the two] is that there are four guys.”
As with all things, it is impossible to please everyone. Some moviegoers may be put off by the film’s lewd or juvenile approach to humor while others will see the movie for that very reason. But regardless of whether or not the film proves to be a critical or commercial success, Duke believes that “there are a lot of people that are looking forward to this movie,” and says that, for the most part, “people are going to enjoy the ride.”

“They should show this to everyone going to Japan,” said Charles D. Teague ’74 as he walked out of the screening of “From Brazil to Japan,” a new documentary directed by Aaron Litvin ’04 and Ana Paula Hirano Litvin, focusing on the new trend of Brazilian immigration to Japan. By crafting a film that highlights the personal experiences of such a journey, the Litvins illuminate both the struggles of immigration as a whole as well as the emotional issues that arise from an ever-globalizing world.
On Tuesday, February 16th the documentary was screened in the TSAI Auditorium of the CGIS South building as part of Harvard’s Brazilian Film Series. It was followed by a question and answer session with the directors. In the audience there were many Brazilians and Japanese, including Mika Iga, Vice Consul in the Consulate General of Japan in Boston.
Over the course of the film, the Litvins tell five immigration stories in a way that is both nuanced and unique. “From Brazil to Japan” follows several families of Brazilian migrants over the course of three years, May 2006 to May 2009, as they move from São Paulo to a new life in Japan. Aaron Litvin explains their reason for choosing this format, saying, “There were many journalistic accounts as well as academic sociological articles about this Brazil-Japan trend, but there was no comprehensive work that followed the same people over time to show the actual developments, changes and experiences.”
In the documentary, the immigrants narrate their own stories, which include many touching, humorous, and heartbreaking moments. The voices of the filmmakers, on the other hand, are not discernable. “That was very conscious decision,” says Aaron Litvin. “We didn’t want to appear and we didn’t want our questions to appear. We decided to not have any external sound added to the film to try to make it as direct and transparent as possible.” This technique creates a sense of authenticity, as the audience gets to know to characters as they tell of their successes, disappointments, hard work, frustrations and personal growth.
Co-director Ana Paula Hirano Litvin says, “At the beginning, the documentary consists more of formal interviews in question and answer format. Then as we got to know the families, and became friends, they became comfortable with us and the camera, and they would talk about their experiences without us even asking. Sometimes we would just stay over at their apartments, cook together, and sleep on their floors. Some of our best scenes were filmed spontaneously at one or two in the morning.” Because of this special relationship between the filmmakers and subjects, the documentary is able to represent an immigration experience from the inside, exposing its full emotional tension.
When asked what inspired him to work on an immigrant story specifically, Aaron Litvin says, “My parents are immigrants from Moscow, who arrived to the U.S. a few years before I was born. Twenty years ago, a documentary in a similar style was made about my family, telling the story of Jewish migrants from the former Soviet Union. This triggered my interest in making a film about immigration.”
Aaron Litvin was a Latin American Studies concentrator in the Romance Languages and Literatures department at Harvard. The idea for a film about Brazil and Japan grew out of Litvin’s senior thesis, entitled “Brazilian Okazaki, a case study of Brazilian migration to Japan.” During his time as an undergraduate, he visited Brazil and studied abroad in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Okazaki, Japan.
“As an undergraduate in Okazaki, I wished I had a camera to capture the lives and experiences of the individuals I had met. I found it limiting to just do a thesis in writing that wouldn’t show their lives and that few people would read. I wanted to create something vivid, and I wanted more people to have the opportunity to learn about this movement,” says Aaron Litvin.
Following graduation, Litvin received a Fulbright scholarship to pursue a masters in sociology at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. He made the documentary as he finished his graduate work, explaining, “Whereas the research is trying to make generalizations and conclusions, the idea of the movie in parallel is to find the singularities, differences, diversity within this group. If there was anything we wanted to show, it is how different the experience is for each person, and how the expectations shape the experience.”

Boasting the tagline “art too bad to be ignored,” the Boston-based Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) hails itself as “the world’s only museum dedicated to the collection, preservation, exhibition and celebration of bad art in all its forms.” The small-scale volunteer-run MOBA received a surprising amount of media attention when it held its first public exhibition in March 1994. The museum then opened its first permanent gallery space in October 1995 next to the men’s room in the basement of the Dedham Community Theater. In May 2008, they expanded to a second gallery space in the Somerville Theater in nearby Davis Square.
To gain entry to the Davis Square gallery, visitors must buy a ticket, not to the gallery, but to a movie playing at the theater, regardless of your desire to actually watch said movie. After entering the theater, the gallery itself is inconspicuously tucked away, located downstairs and down a hallway. It contains about thirty works of bad art drawn from the MOBA collection of over 400 pieces. Some had been rescued from the trash, others purchased at antique fairs, yard sales, second-hand stores or thrift shops, even a few donated by the artists themselves.
You might think, then, that any piece of junk you come across could qualify as bad art. But MOBA won’t settle for just any third-rate canvas; only 10 to 20 percent of submissions are “bad enough” for the MOBA board and there are rigorous rules dictating what will be considered. No works by children, no commercially-produced paintings, and no tacky tourist art are permitted. Nor are kitschy paintings on black velvet, paint-by-numbers, or latch-hook rugs accepted. “Any of the aforementioned may be compelling,” reads the introductory wall text, “but are probably better suited for the Museum of Questionable Taste, the International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration.” Above all, submissions must be sincere attempts to make an artistic statement, not just spoofs competing for the “worst in show” award.
Talent or virtuosity does not preclude admission into the pantheon of bad art, nor does artistic ineptitude alone ensure it. The works that are included vary in style and medium, but most share certain characteristics. First off, bad art tends to be figurative. Garish, unnatural colors seem to be a prerequisite. And much bad art just contains bad subject matter (take, for instance, a bovine form precipitating down what appears to be a waterfall in “Suicide,” or George Seurat relieving himself in the pointillist-style “Sunday on the Pot with George?”).
Many of the works on display in the MOBA galleries are accompanied by tongue-in-cheek wall labels that cite a laundry list of famous artists as possible influences, mocking art historical commentary, and criticism. One label, for instance, compares “The Lady with Big Pants” to Goya’s “Nude Maja,” while another pretends that a painting entitled “The Last Dance” may be, “an atypical, late work by iconoclastic French painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.”
But perhaps the biggest joke of all is that, despite the “bad” tendencies that run through many of the works in the collection, the badness isn’t always apparent. Try as the curators may to establish guidelines and standards for what makes bad art, I’m not sure that it’s all bad, or frankly, all that different from what you might see at a regular art museum. Compare “Out of Joint,” an expressionistic portrait of a seated mustachioed man set against a mustard and teal colored background, to an Egon Schiele self-portrait, for example, and you might have a hard time guessing which one lives at the MOBA and the other at the Met. Leafing through the comment book, I saw that many visitors, like me, couldn’t help but compare the art on display to “good art” and found that the distinctions weren’t always obvious. “Who is to say what is good and bad? Expression is what matters,” wrote one reviewer in the comment book.
The questions that MOBA provokes about aesthetic judgment and the role of the museum are the very same questions raised by many modern and contemporary artists like Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, and Hans Haacke, who turned a critical eye to the context in which their work was exhibited. Indeed, this practice of institutional critique is one of the key influences in the artistic developments of the late 20th century. Is MOBA, then, with its humorous take on the way in which museums assign aesthetic value, participating in this same discourse of institutional critique? What does the very fact of creating a bad art museum say about the over-intellectualized realm of contemporary art? And if MOBA is more interesting for its idea than for the actual works on display, can it be regarded as a piece of conceptual art itself? Is the Museum of Bad Art, in short, a work of good art?

The Abstract Expressionists claimed the canvas as a physical embodiment of their psyche and the Minimalists examined the relationship between the viewer and object. Roni Horn, in the three decades of work currently being shown at the Institute of Contemporary Art/Boston (ICA), attempts to reconcile the two. Horn, a Rhode Island School of Design and Yale University alumna, has been working as a visual artist since the 1970s, garnering critical acclaim, awards, and one-person exhibits at major institutions. Despite the immense body of work, range of time, and differing mediums that the mid-career retrospective includes, “Roni Horn aka Roni Horn” is cohesive in its examination of the ambiguity and contradictions of perception.
The ICA—with its waterfront location, glass and metal architecture, and massive windows streaming natural light—not only stands up to, but compliments the exhibit, holding its own against the Modernist juggernauts Tate Modern in London and Whitney Museum of American Art where “Roni Horn aka Roni Horn” had previously traveled. The building itself opened at the end of 2006—the first new art museum built in Boston in nearly 100 years.
In “Still Water (The River Thames, for Example),” the architectural space best enhances Horn’s work. Fifteen close-up color photographs of water encircle the room, and the ICA supplies a sixteenth image with its floor to ceiling view of the harbor. While this could be construed as distracting in some cases, this intrusion of the gallery space prods the viewer to notice the work’s dualities of motion and stillness, change and permanence, and similarity and difference in relation to the Boston Harbor.
With footnotes of Horn’s meditations on the images below each photograph, there is a repeated application of text in an unexpected medium. The footnotes call attention to three separate, but linked relationships: Horn and the photograph, Horn and the viewer, and the image and viewer.
Working out of the tradition of Minimalism, Horn’s work has traces of the movement—seriality, utilitarian materials, and austere simplicity and beauty. Perhaps some of the most Minimalist pieces in the exhibit, collectively called “White Dickinson,” six bars of cast aluminum and white plastic stand propped in a room evenly spaced from each other. Despite the solidity of the bars, this propping invokes fragility and impermanence, producing an enigma.
Like a piece by influential Minimalist Donald Judd, “White Dickinson” forces the viewer to recognize his relationship with the work, noticing the subtle changes in light and color depending on his position. But unlike Judd’s repeated metal rectangles, all of these bars are separate works, each a different height with a different Emily Dickinson quote embedded in the aluminum. By inserting language, Horn injects her own personality and thus her own hand, breaking the fabricator assembly, non-artistic touch, and industrial mold of Minimalism.
Horn has stripped away text, but still alludes to this discussion of artistic relationships, memory, and change through image and juxtaposition alone in her most recent piece, “a.k.a.” The work consists of pairs of framed photographs of the artist at various stages of her life. Like the photographs of the sea, each image is incredibly different despite being joined by the common denominator of subject matter—in this case, a frontal headshot of Horn.
Within each pair, the photographs contradict and complement one another. Horn, as a late adolescent blanketed with curly brown hair, is juxtaposed with Horn in her middle ages rendered androgynous with her grey crew cut. The composition of each of the photographs—Horn’s head tilted to opposite sides—produces a reflective quality; one image could be flipped across the vertical axis to cover the other. This mirror-like possibility literalizes the actual mirroring of subject matter. The similarity and differences within the pair are simultaneously stressed.
These pairs are repeated to form a set, leaving the viewer to decide how to engage them—as a whole or a succession of couplets—and thus reemphasizing the uniqueness of perception. By casting herself in these pairs for the viewer’s scrutiny, Horn establishes a double-fold relationship between her and the viewer, as well as the object and the viewer. Horn succeeds in rendering photography, which is automatically singular and permanent, multifaceted and ephemeral.
The ICA presents “Roni Horn aka Roni Horn” neither by time nor medium, fittingly letting the viewer traverse and experience the significant collection on his own. A progression in style can be detected between the earlier and more recent works, just as a unity in message can be grasped from the group. Horn spectacularly balances coherence and novelty even in three decades of her work,w while the ICA proves that it can handle such a major exhibition in its relatively new location and building.

February 24-March 6
Lowell House Dining Hall
Directed by Michael A. Yashinsky ’11
Music directed by Channing Yu
Produced by Ryan M. Kichler
Love is complicated enough as it is, but throw politics into the mix and, inevitably, it will remain unrequited. The plot of composer Giacomo Puccini’s “Tosca” explores political intrigue and its ruinous influences on the lives of happy people. This haunting opera pits the police baron Scarpia against lovers Floria Tosca and Mario Cavaradossi, a singer and painter respectively. Set in Napoleonic Italy, the story will be brought to life by the Lowell House Opera—albeit with a twist.
“I believe I’m staying true to the essence and meaning [of the opera],” says Director Michael A. Yashinsky ’11, “but I’m moving it into the twentieth century.” Yashinsky has set his rendition of “Tosca” in fascist Italy, where Mussolini will reprise Napoleon’s tyrannical role.
Yashinsky says that the temporal and geographical shift of the opera has been an artistically liberating move. “If Tosca is in a panic, she can call her friend on the phone. It’s closer to real life, and that’s what this story is about: real people undergoing terribly real stories.”
The opera, which will be sung in Italian with projected English subtitles, features a cast mainly composed of professional vocalists from around the Boston area, with undergraduates primarily included in the chorus. Because of the opera’s strenuous demands on the performers, LHO in fact retains a double cast for this production.
“It’s been a crazily short process,” says Yashinsky of rehearsal, which began just after winter break. He is, however, confident that their dedicated work has been thorough. “School and opera,” he explains. “That’s how we live.”

Elephants, antelopes, birds, and zebras stampede down the aisles of the Boston Opera House, sweeping up the audience in an exciting rush of colors, feathers, fur, and African drumming. From this high-energy, visually explosive opening scene, the Broadway national tour of “The Lion King”—which runs through March 21—dazzles. In a spectacle of lights, songs, puppetry, and dance, the musical’s timeless story unfolds with stunning images and special effects. Despite a few weak performances and a pace that drags towards the end, “The Lion King” remains a successful and entertaining experience that’s worthy of its hype.
The musical—based on the 1994 Disney film, making its Broadway debut in 1997—has won seven Tony awards, including Best Musical. Featuring the music of Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, the show was originally directed by Julie Taymor, also known for her 2007 film “Across the Universe”.
The plot centers on Simba, a young lion who­—with the aid of his animal friends Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, and Rafiki—must reclaim his rightful throne after his father Mufasa is murdered by his jealous uncle Scar.
Easily the most remarkable element of the show is the technical construction of its costumes and props. Actors dressed as blades of grass sport spindly wicker frames around their waists that resemble a more fluid version of hoop skirts, swaying and swirling like reeds in a gentle Sahara breeze. The coarse spines of hair snaking along the hunched backs of the hyenas create spooky, spiky silhouettes.
Best of these designs, perhaps, are the diaphanous birds which are suspended at the top of long, wiry poles carefully manipulated by graceful actors below. Whether colorful and exuberantly used—as in dazzling high-production numbers like “Hakuna Matata”—or charcoal gray and hauntingly employed—as buzzards circling a carcass in Scar’s elephant graveyard—the airy bird-puppets are some of the most elegant technical elements in the show.
Some of the show’s actors are particularly adroit at realizing the creative possibilities afforded by this intricate attire. Scar (Brent Harris), for instance, does a particularly skillful job of inhabiting his body as a lion, making excellent use of his elaborate costume to leap, prowl, and slink like a true feline.
Also impressive is Jerome Stephens Jr., who plays the young Simba. Though only a skinny boy of nine, he manages to pack a musical punch. While his lines largely read as formulaic and somewhat trite (“I just want to be brave like you, Dad,” he insists cloyingly to his father), and the development of his character is confined to the wild, wide-eye child role, he’s undeniably a vocal powerhouse packed in a pint-sized body.
Less successfully, the characters of Timon (Tyler Muree) and Pumbaa (Ben Lipitz) dutifully serve their function of lighthearted comic relief, but both actors appear to be consciously straining to imitate the precise vocal accents and delivery style of their cinematic predecessors (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, respectively). Worse, Zazu’s (Tony Freeman) over-acted comic antics and Rafiki’s (Phindile Mkhize) bouts of verbal incomprehensibility quickly grow tiresome.
Certain performance numbers, however, are downright spectacular, like the well-known tune “I Just Can’t Wait to be King,” which features 18-foot high tent-like giraffe neck-puppets that bow and bend to the audience, even nuzzling a few lucky theatergoers in the front row.
The instrumental talents in the show are also not to be missed, as the orchestra boxes on the right and left sides of the stage contain a single bongo drummer in each, thus engaging the space beyond the main stage with the work’s pounding African heartbeat. The orchestra is best appreciated on intensely percussive numbers like the sinister song “Be Prepared,” and in brief, yet beautiful interludes which usually accompany transitional movement scenes.
While overall the show’s dialogue remains rather predictable and plain, a brief scene between Zazu and Scar allows time for the exchange of a few clever remarks. As a depressed Scar complains about his now famine-and-disease plagued kingdom, he moans, “I feel so empty,” to which the disdainful Zazu quips, “You’re a regular Ennui the Eighth, sire.” Later in the same scene, when Scar tries to rally himself by insisting, “I need to buck up,” Zazu once more dryly retorts, “You’ve already bucked up royally”.
A few additions to the plot prove unnecessary, such as the musical number entitled “The Morning Report,” which is a sunny but vapid tune led by Zazu that appears to have been added solely for the enjoyment of the under-6 crowd, as it proves content-less and only weakly amusing. And at a total run time of two hours and 45 minutes, plenty of opportunities for cutting superfluous scenes exist.
Ultimately, however, even the show’s somewhat lagging pace and occasionally less-than-stellar acting can’t detract from the overall sense of magic and spectacle created by the work. “The Lion King” provides the perfect mid-winter retreat to sunny Africa, offering a lush and immersive musical escape to the color and fantasy of an exotic land.               —Staff writer Clio C.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Let’s get the band back together one more time,” says Damon Albarn, in a heavy faux-American accent, of the sentiment that led to Blur’s brief but stunning reunion last summer. Albarn clearly knows that what he’s saying is more than a little cliché. Yet it’s an absolutely sincere statement, and the group have thoroughly earned that sincerity. Though there seem to be as many bands reuniting as forming these days, the Blur reunion felt particularly special. “No Distance Left to Run,” the new documentary chronicling the British band’s career and reunion, proves just how special it was.
Directed by Dylan Southern and Will Lovelace, “No Distance Left to Run” tells two stories simultaneously: an overview of the band’s original life from 1989 to 2003, and the story of their reunion, including their huge concerts at Glastonbury and Hyde Park. The film is structured rather curiously, frequently interrupting the narrative of the band’s career to show footage from 2009’s warm-up gigs and jumping from the youthful teenage version of the band writing their first album, “Leisure,” to the seasoned veterans touring their greatest hits around Britain. As such, the film can be a little confusing for those who don’t already have a pretty good idea of what Blur achieved, and is only really appropriate for fans of the band. For these fans, however, “No Distance Left to Run” is perfect in just about every way.
The dual narrative structure is absolutely critical to the film’s success. Frankly, if “No Distance Left to Run” had been purely chronological, it would have been rather depressing. As the film shows, being in Blur was far from an easy job. Despite the fact that they were one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, Blur seemed to have far more moments of resignation, anger, and bitterness than of elation. Early in their career they lashed out against their record company, the hollowness of grunge culture, and the pervasive influence of America on British life. At the peak of their success they resented the label of “Britpop,” hated the pressures of fame, and were constantly faced with the greater success of their perennial rivals, Oasis. Later, guitarist Graham Coxon’s alcoholism, singer Albarn’s heartbreak, and growing internal tensions drove the band to change their sound and, ultimately, break up.
What both the film and reunion gigs prove, however, is that all of these troubles no longer need to be dwelled upon. Through a series of interviews with the four band members, “No Distance Left to Run” probes their feelings on their career and reunion, clearly revealing how important getting back together was to all four members. On meeting with Coxon again, Albarn says, “All that rubbish on both sides seemed to have evaporated.” Bassist Alex James talks about playing “Tender” at Glastonbury as a life-changing experience. The shy and awkward Coxon is particularly fascinating. Of the aftermath of Albarn throwing him out of Blur, he mumbles, “The idea of bumping into any of them was terrifying,” showing just how bad things had gotten for the group. Regarding the reunion and its high-profile nature, however, he says, “I think we all really needed to be very public about this healing process. And the music was a big part of the healing process.”
By interspersing the present with the past, “No Distance Left to Run” places the focus squarely on this healing process, on how the bitterness of the past turned into the joy of last summer. Even when the group is talking of their absolute lows, such as when a visibly moved Albarn explains how “Beetlebum” describes other people’s (and presumably his) experiences with heroin, right around the corner is another gig or interview of the band once again enjoying themselves. Though this focus on redemption could have been cheesy, in reality it’s entirely appropriate. Just as the film shows, Blur’s image was transformed by their reunion. Albarn’s final words at the end of the film perfectly place the focus on how Blur’s camaraderie was restored—“At the end of the day, what we have done, which so many bands who split up didn’t do, is we managed to come back intact and do the best gigs we’d ever done, and that for me is what is different about us. The fact that we did that is testament to our original friendship.”
In addition to the documentary, “No Distance Left to Run” includes a superb live recording of the first of Blur’s two Hyde Park gigs. The band are in absolutely phenomenal form, moving through a diverse greatest hits set that includes their most famous songs while featuring astonishing performances of lesser known tracks like “Oily Water” and “Trimm Trabb.” The concert is the perfect accompaniment for the documentary, proving once again how remarkable and joyous the reunion was. At the beginning of the encore at Hyde Park, Albarn tells the audience, “We feel privileged to be able to do nothing for so many years and then come back to this.” As “No Distance Let to Run” proves, through their character, their history, and always through their music, Blur have fully earned such a privilege.

Cormac McCarthy’s “The Road” is one of the few recent novels that has achieved commercial as well as critical success. Given McCarthy’s elegant minimalist style and simple, episodic plot, I wondered how this post-apocalyptic novel was capable of capturing the national imagination. It was only after attempting to read Philip Roth’s 1997 novel “American Pastoral,” however, that the merits of “The Road” became apparent. One can learn important things from a novel without even finishing it.
Though I only read the first section of Roth’s novel, I was immediately overwhelmed by its heavy fog of exhausted and demoralized irony. “American Pastoral” is replete with characters who lack consequential or connected outer lives, and who also lead hollow and phlegmatic inner lives. These characters are trapped in listless, “nether lives,” in which neither their exterior jobs nor their interior fantasies and dreams inspire them.
The novel is narrated by Roth’s authorial alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman, who examines his high school’s star athlete—a man nicknamed “the Swede” (although he, like the narrator, is Jewish). On the very first page Roth explains that the Swede gave the neighborhood the chance to “enter into a fantasy about itself and about the world.” Zuckerman explains, “Our families could forget the way things actually work and make an athletic performance the repository of all their hopes.” Essentially, the community nourishes their impoverished inner lives with the successful outer life of the Swede.
In the first chapter, which takes place years after they have graduated high school, the Swede, who wants help writing a memoir about his recently deceased father, invites the elderly Zuckerman to dinner. Zuckerman is captivated by the opportunity to explore what he dubs “the substratum,” his term for the deep and authentic life of the mind. This quest for the profound proves devastating as the Swede only discusses the happy, superficial lives of his family and does not even mention grieving for his father. During the dinner scene, Roth juxtaposes paragraphs in which the Swede relates inane family anecdotes against extended interior monologues tracking Zuckerman’s overwrought reactions to the disappointing way the meal develops. The chapter concludes with the narrator’s self-questioning rant, “Why the appetite to know this guy?... You’re craving depths that don’t exist. This guy is the embodiment of nothing.”
The dinner conversation dramatizes Roth’s self-destructive tension between the inner and outer life, which paralyzes the novel. Ironically, Zuckerman himself lacks a self-sufficient inner life and must search for the nonexistent inner life of the Swede to justify his own mental existence. While the Swede hopes to resolve the troubles of his inner life with the accomplishments of the outer life, the remaining characters are cut off from meaningful action.
Roth harshly ironizes the suburban middle-class conception of the “American Dream.” The comfortable amenities of bourgeois existence have drained the characters of meaningful “substrata” as well as worthwhile exterior vocations. While Roth successfully dramatizes how American values leave his characters trapped in hollow nether lives, all the reader is left with is an aftertaste of tired irony. None of the characters share any significant connections with other people. “American Pastoral” shows a bitter landscape of spiritual aridity in which Roth’s sardonic probing almost dehumanizes his characters. The overbearing irony of Roth’s enervated vision of America might easily fatigue his reader.
In contrast to “American Pastoral,” Cormac McCarthy’s novel “The Road” has room for love, purpose, and human heroism despite being set in a post-apocalyptic world. “The Road” centers on a father and son who try to survive while traveling through a ravaged American landscape that has been destroyed by some unspecified disaster. Both the inner and outer lives of the father and son are essential to the novel’s message. The external scenes where the pair hide from a band of roaming cannibals or chase a thief who stole a shopping cart holding their only food are filled with a basic human vitality that is lacking in “American Pastoral.” Moreover, a simple exchange in dialogue in which the father asks his son if he is cold is saturated with more genuine inner life than one of Zuckerman’s page long self-examination.
While I suspect that the commercial success of McCarthy’s work may be due to the tropes of science fiction and action rather than its literary merits, that does not diminish the power of McCarthy’s intensely human portrait of a father and son. Where Roth and many other contemporary novelists write about an ironic and dehumanizing world that leaves characters externally disconnected and spiritually enervated, McCarthy embraces humanity in all of its weakness, madness, and strength. Some people may find detailed digressions on spiritual exhaustion profound, but this reader found it merely exhausting.

Michael Beard’s life is a series of contradictions. He is a Nobel Laureate, but also a scientific fraud. He is the chief of a climate research center, but doesn’t believe in global warming. Riding on the coattails of his own youthful contribution to Einstein’s groundbreaking work, Beard is thoroughly dissatisfied with his life and disillusioned with the society that continues to laud him for the sole professional achievement he made decades ago. Ian McEwan’s latest novel introduces Beard just as his fifth marriage is dissolving, when an accident provides him with a final chance at personal and professional redemption as an advocate for the health of the planet. While providing a comedic portrait of global warming as a political issue, “Solar” is also an exploration of man’s ability to guide his own life in the modern world.
At the outset of “Solar,” Beard is neither a champion of alternative energy nor persuaded by the dire warnings about rising seas and melting ice. Beard refuses to be won over by the emotional appeals and mass hysteria about a phenomenon that has little immediate impact on his daily life. As one of Beard’s mistresses laments, to take action against global warming “would be to think about it all the time,” something that “daily life would not permit.” But when he is presented with the opportunity to regain his former professional glory as a champion of solar power and the global warming movement, Beard conveniently forgets these concerns and finds his faith in climate change.
As in “Atonement” and “Saturday,” McEwan employs a series of seemingly random accidents to set his characters on paths that they would not have otherwise contemplated. The main accident in “Solar” is a sudden and unforeseen death that enables Beard to recast himself as a friend of the environment. But “Solar” complicates the theme of accidental change that McEwan returns to so often by incorporating a new idea of willful self-deception. Though Beard believes that “barring accidents, life does not change,” he is constantly going through self-imposed reincarnations of his character. Beard is unaware of these changes in himself because he is able to convince himself that his new persona always existed.
With each chapter, Beard discards the unwanted pieces of his former life in order to strive for some higher plane of personal or professional achievement. Beard is “a man of science” with “an automatic respect for internal consistency.”  He knows truth to be “impregnable,” but he also knows that he can abandon his old life in order to inhabit his own reality. Beard believes that after learning “the tricks of managing, of simply being” he will reach “the calm plateau” where he will finally be content. But as he progresses through life, Beard is frustrated with the “pseudo-work” he uses “to mask his irrelevance” and is “well aware of the singularity by which the tiny vehicle of his talent, a child’s tricycle say, had hitched a ride behind the juggernaut of a world historical genius.” Beard’s whole life has been spent unsuccessfully trying to surpass his youthful self who captivated the world with his brilliant achievements.
The futility inherent to Beard’s personal quest for fulfillment and professional crusade against global warming is personified in his own bodily decay. Beard, the lifelong womanizer, neglects his body against his better judgment and the repeated urging of his doctors. Repeated resolutions to lose weight, exercise, and cut back on his daily drinking fall by the wayside as the vinegary scent of potato chips, cool sensation of a scotch-on-the-rocks, and plush comfort of a hotel bed overwhelm Beard’s reptilian brain. This subtle allusion to the problems inherent in collective action against global warming is the site of McEwan’s true argument on the issue. While “Solar” incorporates amusing jabs at hippie environmentalists communing with nature, McEwan is clearly concerned with man’s inability to unite in the face of common adversity, regardless of whether that includes the melting arctic ice.
As “Solar” comes to a close, Beard is forced to confront the various deceptions and half-truths that have defined his life. A chameleon, Beard nevertheless begins to lose control of his relationships, of the image he projects on the world, and of his own beliefs and emotions. The man who shunned commitment and love in favor of status, pleasure, and freedom realizes that the only true solace resides in the personal relationships that endure life’s changes. McEwan’s writing becomes increasingly fatalistic and forlorn as the novel progresses, and Beard realizes that even the “highest ambitions” cannot save him from “another night of unmemorable insomnia.” The environment of “Solar” is populated with miserable individuals who enjoy employment without understanding their purpose, and who embrace causes unprepared and unable to make a difference. Through Beard, McEwan hints that satisfaction is derived from the daily accomplishment of one’s own goals, rather than a perpetual search for a better future. But while living in the moment might allow for immediate happiness, it prevents the reflection necessary for addressing problems of the future, whether that problem is global warming or finding a companion in life.

One could easily consume Don DeLillo’s “Point Omega” in a single sitting. Constructed of deliciously clear prose, the deceptively short fifteenth novel from the award-winning author of “White Noise” clocks in at a mere 117 pages, each of which gives the impression of a schoolboy’s essay that fell too far below page count; the line spacing feels tampered with, the sheets seem to contain a curiously low ratio of text to paper. Between each of the six sections lies a blank page—more space, another pause.
It’s as though the book is working against an inclination to condense—a reasonable concern for a story that, despite its size, centers itself around big questions, such as the unknowable power of space and time to erase, restructure, recreate. As usual, DeLillo’s concern for the shadow of self-consciousness falls over this work, altering the gravity of his story’s simple plot.
On September 3, a man visits a small dark room in New York’s Museum of Modern Art to witness “24 Hour Psycho”—a video installation by Douglas Gordan exhibited during the summer of 2006—as he has supposedly done every day. As Gordan’s title implies, Alfred Hitchcock’s seminal film has been slowed, and the man relishes the new perspective, the ability to circle the projection screen, scrutinizing and observing in a typically unattainable way. Two men—one old, one young—walk in, and he imagines them to be kindred spirits, sorely interpreting their departure ten minutes later as a personal snub. He wishes for a female companion to discuss with him the black-and-white, soundless film in this quiet, dark room, hidden inside the busiest museum in the busiest city, a tangle of manmade structures and concepts.
In decided contrast to this shadowy room is the location of the bulk of the story’s chapters, in which the aforementioned pair of men reappear as Richard Elster, a former scholar employed by the military to “conceptualize,” and Jimmy Finley, the young filmmaker who wishes to record Elster’s account of his experience in one, long take. After initial resistance to the idea, Elster invites Jimmy to stay with him in the vast remoteness of a Western desert—“Not a long visit, he’d said.” But the arbitrariness of such adjectives becomes apparent as days turn to weeks and then, presumably, into months. When Elster’s daughter Jessie comes to stay, at the behest of her mother who worries about Jessie’s new male companion, her presence offers Jimmy a new way to see Elster and her father a point of focus. However, we learn that all such points fade in and out of focus.
The first chapter opens: “The true life is not reducible to words spoken or written, not by anyone, ever. The true life takes place when we’re alone, thinking, feeling, lost in memory, dreamingly self-aware, the submicroscopic moments.” This, the abstract framework, is the most important aspect of DeLillo’s novel, more so than a development of characters or the lack thereof, the progression of plot or its absence altogether.
For DeLillo, the tension between individual consciousness and history, inner reality and outer reality, is at the core of his characters’ existences. “We’re a crowd, a swarm,” Elster says. “We think in groups, travel in armies. Armies carry the gene for self-destruction. One bomb is never enough. The blur of technology, this is where the oracles plot their wars. Because now comes the introversion. Father Teilhard knew this, the omega point.”
The omega point is the ultimate development of complexity and consciousness, toward which all intellectual evolution must be heading, a position free from the constraints of space and time.
Somewhere between the overwhelming structure of the city and the natural expressions of time manifested in the desert, between the two, exact days that mark the beginning and end of the book and the melting of months that comprise its body, DeLillo tries to grasp the blend of individual and society. There exists a communal desire to understand others while trying to maintain one’s sense of self.
The novel’s final section takes place on September 4. A woman arrives on this day, stands beside the man to watch the film. “She said, ‘What would it be like, living in slow motion?’ If we were living in slow motion, the movie would be just another movie. But he didn’t say this.’” By this day, the movie’s slowness no longer lends him clarity; he can’t be certain of the details he’s witnessed, is unsure of the number of times he’s watched a particular scene. On any scale, then, things begin to blur after a while, one becomes unsure of one’s self.
Minutes later, the man tells the woman that as a young child he would often multiply numbers in his head. She responds that she would watch the ways lips formed words, and could decipher their messages without hearing: “The face had brightened slightly when he talked about the numbers he did in his head as a kid. Not brightened but sort of loosened, her eyes showing interest. But the story wasn’t true. He did not multiply large numbers in his head, ever. This was something he said sometimes because he thought it would help explain him to others.”  Between these two, an understanding is exchanged, a balance between individual thoughts and interactions with the rest of the world. Its brevity does not diminish its seeming importance. “Point Omega” demonstrates that DeLillo is a master of his craft, not simply because he understands what it can do, but because he also feels its restraints.

On “Impossible,” the second track from his debut album “Love & War,” Daniel Merriweather sings, “I know I said some corny lines / That you probably heard a thousand times.” Agreed. But it’s no surprise that producer Mark Ronson’s R&B protégé isn’t exactly unpredictable. Much like Ronson’s previous collaborator, Amy Winehouse, Merriweather makes music that’s all about immediacy. Every song on “Love & War” feels like a single, relying on a simple, catchy melody that inevitably builds to a climactic but predictable bridge. If you’re 30 seconds into a track and not bobbing your head, you might as well skip it.
Merriweather, however, certainly deserves a chance to prove himself. Though he has the unenviable job of following Winehouse and Adele out of Ronson’s stable, if each song is left to stand on its own merits, Merriweather’s work proves to be exactly what he was presumably trying to deliver: a collection of good-to-great soul-pop songs. It’s a hit-or-miss endeavor, but Merriweather hits more than he misses.
The opening track, “For Your Money,” suggests a different direction from what the album actually ends up taking. The Bowie-esque piano intro, relatively abstract lyricism, and Sean Lennon’s fuzzy electric guitar suggest a rock edge the rest of the album simply doesn’t deliver. However, it is certainly an excellent opener, and while the tracks to come are different, they do not necessarily disappoint.
Sometimes, even songs that seem to have gone off-track are salvaged by unexpected contrivances from Ronson and Merriweather’s well-stocked bag of tricks. For instance, “Change,” the lead single, overcomes a chorus that evokes John Mayer with its hopelessly generic political statements—“Ain’t nothing gonna change / If nobody’s gonna wake up and start asking who’s in charge.” The infectious piano loop—worthy of early Kanye West—irresistibly fun brass accents, and merrily chirpy background singing make up for the lyrical missteps.
“Water and a Flame” runs a risk inherent in featuring Adele—namely, that Adele will steal the show—but avoids disaster by pairing the two singers toward the end, making it more of a seamless collaboration than a chance for one to outshine the other. “Could You,” meanwhile, has a chorus that references “My Girl,” but its bluesy guitar work and “doo-bee” falsetto bridge separate it from The Temptations’ original. The success of this bridge section is characteristic of an album whose best lyrical moments are impassioned, wordless cries.
It seems that words aren’t quite Merriweather’s thing, nor do they need to be. Standout track “Impossible” is proof enough that Merriweather doesn’t need to say anything particularly compelling to craft a memorable soul-pop number. A playfully hypnotic bass line, punctuating guitar and gratuitous strings give the cliché chorus—“There ain’t nothing, nothing / Nothing impossible for your love”—a renewed immediacy.
At times Merriweather reaches beyond Ronson’s impeccably polished production to make something that feels new, as with the self-deprecating amble of a highlight, “Cigarettes,” and the surprisingly poignant, slowly-building “Live by Night.” Though many choruses are frustratingly unoriginal, “Chainsaw” thoroughly breaks this pattern with the bizarre refrain, “Giving myself to you is like giving myself to a chainsaw.” Though this line falls flat, Merriweather has the benefit of a sound big enough to command some melodrama, and, even when he overreaches, he overreaches with a brazenness that’s fun to listen to and more than a little endearing.
Final track “Giving Everything Away for Free” is one of those overreaches, ultimately a little too stripped-down for Merriweather’s style and a little too egotistical to communicate the feeling of selfless love he’s going for. But by then, “Love & War” has already succeeded, and it’s easy to spot him a throwaway track. Those looking for Winehouse’s male counterpart may be disappointed—Merriweather has an expressive voice with a surprising upper register and a certain reckless charm to boot, but he ultimately can’t match Winehouse for alluring audacity. Even so, what Merriweather proves is that with a catchy melody, impassioned vocals, and some soul, the same corny lines still sound good the thousandth time.

Only when discussing indie rock can two people express their love for artists so completely different as MGMT and Bon Iver and still feel comfortable saying they like the same genre. Yet despite the nebulous nature of the term, the many facets of indie rock are represented on L.A. band Local Natives’ debut LP, “Gorilla Manor,” crafting a well-tailored snapshot of many of the most prevalent and exciting trends in indie music today.
On album opener, “Wide Eyes,” Local Natives present a clear mission statement. The driving drums pulse under electronica-influenced rim clicks and the determined picking of the guitar line. This drum track is instantly reminiscent of the Dodos and the National, bands that have pioneered the now-popular “big drum” sound pervasive throughout much of indie rock. The bass is melodic, driving the song as much as the guitar. Due to their spaced-out reverb and ethereal interval, the constantly harmonized vocals are reminiscent of Fleet Foxes. The song is comprised of carefully constructed parts that build, then segue seamlessly, always driven by the throbbing drums and the wandering bass.
The songs on “Gorilla Manor” are layered in such a way as to eschew the idea of a limited role for each musician. The melody of “Warning Sign,” a Talking Heads cover, is sung completely in harmony. This mirrors a trend seen in many bands like Grizzly Bear to dispense with a specific lead singer and instead focus on harmonies and dual vocalists. On “Stranger Things,” furious strings cut in and out to build the tension, and the guitars layer at the end of the track, becoming an indistinguishable, blissed-out mass. This is just one example of how the songs layer many small parts for each instrument one on top of the other.
The album reaches a pinnacle on the stunning “Who Knows Who Cares.” A reticent, finger-picked guitar figure plays alone, punctuated only by extraneous string noise, before the wide-open piano chords punch in, bouncing off the uninterrupted guitar. One of the vocalists begins singing the melody before the other drapes a gauzy harmony on top. The opening is enchanting enough to repeat for another three minutes, but Local Natives refuse to rest on their laurels. Instead, the song swings into a taut rock groove with punchy electric guitars and a gurgling bass. The drums cut in and out, adding tension and release at the perfect moments and then letting the track build slowly upon itself with each soaring harmony before the ultimate release of blazing guitar and fist pumping high notes. The joyful climax of its chorus, worthy of Arcade Fire, is a phenomenal emotional release.
On “Gorilla Manor,” Local Natives don’t present anything the audience hasn’t heard before. Instead, they encapsulate the current state of a genre that is characterized by its indefinable nature. This is enjoyable and intelligent indie rock circa 2010, and the album, while nothing new, is still powerful. In its remarkable breadth, the album offers one possible definition of indie music: a music where people can bring sounds together without regard to genre or what these sounds may connote. Local Natives embrace this freedom on “Gorilla Manor,” and the result, while familiar, is too well-made not to be enjoyed.

The cover of Shearwater’s new album, “The Golden Archipelago,” features strikingly dramatic imagery. A man on a canoe, completely covered in a white sheet, follows a golden, sunlit pathway toward a lush island. It suggests a reversion to an innocent and natural life, immediately hinting at the album’s anti-societal theme. Unfortunately, after appreciating the cover, it is probably best to leave “The Golden Archipelago” alone, as the album fails to achieve the quality of music necessary to back up such a powerful message.
Formed in Austin, Texas, Shearwater are named after the graceful bird that inhabits several tropical islands. Co-founder Jonathon Meiberg, the singer, guitarist, and driving creative force behind the band, imbues his music with a romantic touch derived from his love of nature. His music overflows with emotion and spirituality, attempting to contrast nature’s purity to society’s artificiality.
Shearwater’s romanticism is perfectly reflected in the opening thirty seconds of the album. Before even a note is played, a profound tribal song, reminiscent of a prayer, greets the listener. This prologue segues into the first track, “Meridian,” which continues to be a testament to the group’s talent. Shearwater expertly create a rich texture through guitar and multiple percussive instruments, including bells, while Meiberg lyrically juxtaposes the peaceful ocean with violent warfare. Cymbal rushes wash powerfully over the listener, simultaneously invoking the sound of ocean waves and exploding bombs. The effect is powerful and thought-provoking, and if the rest of the album was as inspiring as the opening, Shearwater would have created a masterpiece.
This promise is never fulfilled, however, as far too often the remaining tracks fail to distinguish themselves from where the album started. The once fresh and complexly layered sounds quickly become stale and pedantic. “Hidden Lakes,” to take just one example, maintains an aura that is reminiscent of “Meridian,” which primarily derives from Meiberg’s unchanging singing style and the repetitive nature of the underlying music. Not only is the lack of variety monotonous, it also detracts from the merits of each individual song, as each seems incapable of saying anything original.
Not only do the songs lack variety, but the emotions of the album frequently feel forced. In particular, Meiberg strains his voice ad nauseum to create melodrama, manipulating his deep baritone to sound as though it comes from a heavy trance. While at times this is an asset, his voice becomes more and more affected as the album progresses, until it reaches an unbearable level of pretension. The zenith of Meiberg’s vocal affectation can be heard on “God Made Me,” where he abhorrently accentuates every note with an exaggerated swell of his voice.
Accompanying Meiberg’s affected voice are his equally affected lyrics. A particularly insufferable track is “Corridors,” which depicts a man being tortured by the man-made world. At the climax of the song, Meiberg screams out, “Chain him to the burning carousel / Till the horses tire / Blast away the bearings of his life / Till his eyes are wild / Till his eyes are white.” This violent imagery is the epitome of how appalling Meiberg’s hatred for the man-made can be. Yet his overbearing words suggest that he is trying too hard to let us know just how much he cares.
The imagery of the lyrics throughout certainly has deeper meaning, and there is much to explore on “The Golden Archipelago.” The deluxe edition of the album includes a fifty-page booklet, “The Golden Dossier,” to accompany the carefully crafted songs. The dossier contains pictures of foreign islands and birds, and excerpts of explorers’ memoirs that have traveled to such islands. One excerpt in particular, where an explorer speaks of shooting natives, was clearly chosen to add to Meiberg’s already overdrawn sloganeering, which after listening to the album is already tiresome.
Amidst the plethora of blunt, hackneyed messages from Shearwater, they seem not to have focused enough on developing the music. Despite a few strong tracks and some occasionally thought-provoking imagery, when faced with the prospect of re-listening to “The Golden Archipelago,” it’s much more tempting to put on something a little less heavy-handed.

Shifting shadows welcome the viewer to “The Glass Menagerie,” Tennessee Williams’ 1944 play about family and failure. Hung from the ceiling of the Loeb Experimental Theater, sewn plastic figures glisten against thick sheets of cloth. As the audience enters, the wonderful and mysterious sculpture—designed by Sara J. Stern ’12—sways and sighs. It looms over the neat and trim set and veils it with a hesitating shade.
Such shadows are the perfect introduction to Williams’ play, where the hopes of a St. Louis family shatter under a soft mist of melancholy. Their hazy promise is mostly carried through in this production, directed by Megan E. O’Keefe ’11. O’Keefe’s “Menagerie,” which runs through Feb. 27th, is well acted and well thought-out. If the show occasionally stumbles into melodrama, it is only because O’Keefe tries too hard to clarify details that could instead remain a little foggy.
Living in humid, jazzy 1930s St. Louis, the Wingfield family spends much of their time wishing they were elsewhere. Amanda (Caroline R. Giuliani ’11) constantly relives her past as a Southern Belle besotted by male attention. She wants the same youth for her 23 year-old daughter, Laura. But Laura (the wide-eyed Rachel A. Stark ’11—a Crimson news editor), who is slightly disabled and cripplingly shy, instead devotes her days to her collection of glass animals. In and out clamors Tom (David J. Smolinsky ’11), Laura’s exuberant and adventurous younger brother, who dreams of a life more exciting than his job at a shoe factory can offer.
The family’s only beacon lies in an ever-elusive gentleman caller, Jim O’Connor (the pleasant and jocular Anthony J. Sterle ’11), whose presence, they hope, will cure their ills.
This tight plot is really an illustration of weightier emotions. “I have a poet’s weakness for symbols,” says Tom, who often acts as the play’s narrator. As they despair and shout across master painter Snoweria Zhang ’12’s well-crafted backdrop, Williams’s characters are really grappling with the tragedy of their own lives.
Layers of despair call for both depth and nuance, and luckily the production is graced with a skilled cast. Smolinsky, in particular, moves from rowdy son to introspective poet with invigorating ease. His monologues come across both poignant and casual; he is the production’s most likeable character inhabited by the show’s most capable actor.
Giuliani, too, does a fine job of capturing Amanda’s fading beauty, though her fast talk makes her lines sometimes difficult to follow. When she intentionally slips into a Southern drawl halfway through the play, her performance improves greatly.
Much of the production rests on making the audience a part of the crumbling Wingfield household, and O’Keefe craftily invites the viewer in. The seats are pulled in several feet from the wall, so that the Ex, already a small and snug performance space, here becomes even more intimate. When Jim and Laura share a charming dance toward the end of the play, the close setting makes the ethereal moment all the more fleeting.
But at times, such efforts at intimacy tend toward the pedantic. Midway through the play’s intermission, Stark emerges from backstage and begins to toy with the hanging sculpture. Her inviting looks and teasing air seem to beckon viewers to play along. Some audience members joined in, but the rest of the room froze. It’s one thing to slip into Laura’s world, another to be dragged.
Occasional stylistic choices, like a saccharine soundtrack mostly culled from the 2001 French film “Amélie,” also slightly encumber the production. Stark’s character is already painted as sweet, which she plays to full effect, so the added cuteness comes across heavy-handed.
Williams called “The Glass Menagerie” a “memory play,” which suggests that the piece should run more on its atmosphere than concrete facts. Williams himself has a poet’s weakness for symbols, and the play needs a certain fragility to keep it from being overly melodramatic. The current production in the Loeb sets the right mood and proceeds with confidence. When it plods, it also does so with charm.

What defines the ambiguous distinction between a national and a world citizen, and how do institutions such as art museums influence the shifting interplay between local and global identity?
These concepts of politics, art, citizenship, and culture converged at the Kennedy School on February 16 in a discussion entitled “Representing Americanness?: Museums, the Nation, and the Globe.” Presented by The Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations, the Office for the Arts at Harvard, and the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, the event’s speakers examined the role that museums play in bridging the gap between domestic and international concerns.
Experts assembled from across the country to form a mosaic of perspectives and opinions. Speaking during the event were Elliot B. Davis of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Kathleen A. Foster of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and Timothy A. Burgard of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Each participant presented a separate statement, delving into a particular aspect of the afternoon’s themes before briefly convening as a panel for a question-and-answer session.
Davis took the opportunity to speak about a significant new addition to the MFA emerging from its recent renovation: a new American Wing, which is set to open in late 2010. This new effort will showcase works from North, Central, and South America in a chronological manner to evoke a sense of exploration and engagement in its visitors. “However you explore this wing, we do hope you will find something of great interest to you,” Davis said.
Meanwhile, Foster continued the discussion by exploring the role that museums played in fostering community, citing evidence from her hometown of Philadelphia. She illustrated art’s potential to unify by recounting an instance in which the inhabitants of Philadelphia joined together to prevent an outside collector from purchasing Thomas Eakin’s painting “The Gross Clinic”—which holds cultural and historical significance for their city—from the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
“Philadelphians recognized that there was something special about their own history,” she said. “The power of the community to act together was affirmed.”
According to Foster, art institutions are fundamentally linked to local identity. “There really is no such thing as a universal museum. I think every museum from small to large is really a local institution,” she said. Broadening the scope of the discussion, Burgard presented a more critical and incisive assessment. He condemned what he saw as a “protracted and self conscious attempt to fix a uniform American cultural identity” within museums.
Burgard argued that “we might question the motivation, validity and relevance of [this attempt] in an era of increasingly complex cultures and conflicts. Indeed, once outside the confines of the customs line at an airport, the perception of a dichotomy between American and non-American or even un-American validates assumptions that it instead ought to challenge.”
Moreover, he criticized the homogenous image of the United States and the traditional projection of a national culture. Yet he qualified that position with a vision of a future in which museums will cultivate more meaningful interactions with the international sphere.
“Museums could play an important role fostering at once national and international citizens, especially since only one quarter of Americans own a passport whereas one third of Americans visit an art museum every year,” Burgard said.
Ultimately, the speakers had more in common than their obligatory quips about Tuesday’s less-than-stellar weather—each recognized the art museum’s ability to represent what it means to be an American. Closing remarks by Ivan Gaskell, a curator at Harvard’s Fogg Art Museum and a senior lecturer on History, left the audience with a series of dramatic and tantalizing questions.
“Do we want our museums to foster the critical faculties appropriate for citizenship, or do we want them to foster docility?” Gaskell asked. “Which is the better safeguard of order and liberty?”

Omara Portuondo is a Cuban music and film superstar whose career has spanned over 60 years. The U.S. leg of her “Gracias” tour, which will make a stop at Sanders Theater on February 26, will mark the first time that a Cuban performer has been granted a visa to perform in the United States since 2003. Born in 1930 to a wealthy Spanish mother and a black, pro-athlete father during a time when mixed-race marriages were forbidden, she blossomed into a gifted singer and dancer, going on to perform with the well-known Buena Vista Social Club and to win a 2009 Latin Grammy for her latest album “Gracias.” In an email to The Harvard Crimson translated from Spanish, Portuondo anticipates her return to the states by answering questions about performing at Harvard, her longstanding career, and the future of Cuban music.
The Harvard Crimson: Do you think your mixed-race background is and has been a large influence in your musical style and performance over the course of your career?
Omara Portuondo: My parents taught me to feel and to be the same as everyone, even if they lived in a period where black and white people could not get married. They didn’t understand the differences between people, and they educated us with these values. Ever since I started music, when I was only a little girl, all the people who I’ve worked with have been from mixed races, cultures, and influences. The Buena Vista Social Club is the best example for that, as well as my own musicians.
THC: You have had a long, extraordinary career lasting for over 60 years. How have you remained devoted to your music for such a long time? How do you stay inspired to perform?
OP: I enjoy what I do. I enjoy the recordings and challenges that arise from recording with different musicians. I love music and I can bring it all over the world through tours. Contact with the audience is always very special and gives me lots of energy; that’s what inspires me and excites me every day.
THC: Do you think that the Gracias Tour will be your last major tour, or do you still have plans to continue touring around the world?
OP: Well, I can’t say that, only nature can say it. In order to [keep] touring I need to be healthy! That’s the most important thing. If health is with me, I still have lots of projects, and I really hope I can continue to tour.
THC: Do you feel honored to be the first Cuban artist in six years granted a visa to perform in the US? Why do you think you were the first Cuban artist allowed back in such a long time?
OP: I feel really honored that we can bring our music again to the United States. Now a lot of Cuban artists will also have the opportunity, and this is the most important thing. Music knows nothing at all about frontiers.
THC: What song is the most special to you to perform for audiences?
OP: I enjoy all the songs from this last album, but it is true that there are two or three songs that cannot be missed: “Dos Gardenias,” “Veinte Años,” and “Besame Mucho.”
THC: For American college students interested in learning more about your music, performances, and legacy, which of your records would you recommend starting with?
OP: Maybe the last one, ˝Gracias.˝ I celebrate 60 years of my career with it, and I wanted to play important music for me. For the occasion, I invited different musicians like Richard Bona, Avishay Coher, and Trilok Gurtu. I would also recommend my first solo album, “Magia Negra”; with this one, young people will know that we used to listen to music from all around the world. On “Magia Negra” we played North American music with Bossa Nova influences. That was what we used to listen to, along with our own Cuban music.
THC: What is special to you about performing in Boston, and, in particular, at Sanders Theater?
OP: It is really special for me; Boston is a very special city. With Buena Vista Social Club, we had the great opportunity to visit a few times, and I really have very nice memories from here. I’m really happy to come back. Sanders Theater is a really nice theater where artists can enjoy playing, and I’m sure that it will be the perfect environment to present my last album “Gracias.” I’m happy, and it is an honor for me.
THC: What are your opinions on the state of Cuban music today? You and many of your colleagues represent, in a way, the old guard of Cuban music. Do you like the new direction that Cuban music is headed?
OP: Cuba is full of different styles and different ways to perform music; it has always been like this. Now it is rap, hip hop, reggaeton... I admire everything that is done with the heart and with quality and feeling. It is true that I belong to another older generation, but “today” belongs to young people, and now is their moment. The best example is the pianist on tour with me, Roberto Fonseca. He loves jazz, [and] he is a virtuous man. We have to help new generations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the summer of 2009, film student Alexandra E. Zimbler ’10 visited her grandmother in Saint-Malo, Brittany, to interview her for her documentary thesis film in Visual and Environmental Studies (VES). She had planned to make a film about her grandmother’s life in a nursing home, but found her main character in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. “She didn’t have her memory any more,” Zimbler said. “I went to her old apartment, looking for photographs, anything that would give me clues about her life and her past. I found some original letters that she had written to my grandfather in 1951 and 1952. That was the key.”
These discoveries inspired Zimbler to intercut her documentary project with fiction segments based on her grandmother’s correspondence. Six months later, after arranging to take her fall exams in absentia, Zimbler flew to Paris with the director of photography for her project, Alexander E. Berman ‘10. The two held auditions for the fiction scenes six hours after arriving in Paris, and began shooting the next day.
From within the Film track in VES, Zimbler benefits from a department steeped in tradition and generous with its grants. While not as career-oriented as other school’s programs, the track offers students both conceptual grounding and creative experience in an economy increasingly hostile to independent filmmakers.
CONCEPTS VS. CAREERS
Filmmaking can be one of the more precarious fields for undergraduates to enter immediately after graduating. Would-be documentarians face difficulty getting funding outside Harvard, and those looking for work on fiction films encounter their own set of obstacles. “You can’t get a job on a set unless you’ve had job on a set,” remarked Robb Moss, a lecturer on nonfiction filmmaking in the VES department and the director of documentaries “Secrecy” and “The Same River Twice.”
To avoid financial pitfalls, Zimbler hopes to apply for fellowships and grants from Harvard that will allow her to pursue a documentary about children and sports after graduation. “I’ve been thinking about going to China, to [the] Ukraine, to different places in Russia. I seem,” she said with a smile, “to have this fever about filming abroad.” Between the obvious costs of travel and permits, and Zimbler’s affinity for more expensive recording material—her thesis, “Dear George” was shot on high-definition digital video and Super 16—she’ll need those grants.
To complicate matters, the VES film program is not structured to channel students directly into the industry. Because the Film/Video field teaches film as a concentration within the liberal arts, the methodology of the Harvard film program often varies wildly from how film is taught in undergraduate film schools such as the ones at New York University, the University of Southern California and the University of Califonia in Los Angeles.
“In film schools, there is a notion that they’re trying to get you jobs, and that this is an experience that leads you into the industry,” Moss said. “Courses are broken down into the industrial mode: there are courses on cinematography, or scriptwriting, or producing, or directing. We don’t do that. We are interested in film as a way to know the world, as any other discipline here would.”
Berman would agree. “You don’t necessarily get the screenwriting and dramaturgical education that you would in a film school,” he said. But Harvard’s methodology has its own advantages. “You don’t get dogma or pressure to conform to a certain dramatic structure,” he added. This creative license is one of the chief benefits of learning filmmaking at Harvard.
In addition to the strong conceptual education that students receive, Harvard’s filmmaking program is exceptional in its age and establishment. The Film track of VES was founded early, in 1969. Despite its small size, it boasts several notable graduates, including Mira Nair ’79 (“The Namesake”) and Darren S. Aronofsky ’91 (“The Wrestler”).
This established foundation has also supported the birth of new film programs at Harvard University. In 2005 the VES department diversified their programs with a new Film Studies track, which focuses on analysis and theory rather than production, and created a PhD program in Film and Visual Studies this past fall. This chain of development is a rather unusual one. At other universities, film studies departments long predated filmmaking courses.
ON LOCATION
The university’s location is another draw for filmmakers. Harvard is a well-situated center for nonfiction film production, as is the Boston area in general. Oliver A. Horowitz ’08, a VES teaching fellow, pointed out this advantage. “Not to say that Boston is the epicenter, but Boston is a huge, huge bastion of nonfiction film,” he said.
Many of the big names in documentary—including Moss, Ross McElwee, and Aflred Guzzetti—teach in the Harvard VES program. Beyond Harvard’s campus, Boston is also home to celebrated documentary filmmakers like Frederick Wiseman (“Domestic Violence”)—“kind of the godfather of cinéma vérité,” in the words of Horovitz—and Errol Morris (“The Fog of War”), compared by critic Roger Ebert to Alfred Hitchcock and Federico Fellini. The high concentration of filmmakers in the area is due in part to the number of colleges and universities, many with strong film programs, located in the Boston area.
This film presence can offer a myriad of options to VES graduates like Horovitz who decide to remain in the area. Upon graduating, Horovitz became the first Teaching Fellow of VES 50: Fundamentals of Filmmaking. But due to the Massachusetts Film Tax Credit luring major studios to shoot in Boston, he also has had the opportunity to work on commercial film. “It’s great,” said Horowitz. “I’ve TA-ed here, and on Fridays I’ll PA [work as a Production Assistant] on a hundred-million-dollar movie.”
Damien S. Chazelle ’08, a VES graduate, took advantage of what Boston had to offer in a different way. He worked the energy of the Boston jazz scene and cityscape into a full-length feature film. His film, “Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,” began as his senior thesis and showed at New York City’s celebrated Tribeca Film Festival in 2009.
Chazelle could not have realized his project without continuing support from the Harvard community. A fellow VES concentrator, Jasmine A. McGlade ’07 produced “Guy and Madeline,” while his former roommate Justin G. Hurwitz ‘08 composed the score. Even now in Los Angeles, Chazelle is living with other students from Harvard. “There’s still a kind of community that continues after gradu “Because at the end of the day, that’s what it’s all about: finding collaborators whom you trust and who are going to make you a better filmmaker.”
SCREENED FROM THE OUTSIDE
While nurturing students’ personal development, the Harvard community can also isolate them from the outside world. The “Harvard Bubble” is a commonly acknowledged problem amongst students. Although Boston is a center for nonfiction film, many students feel they have not experienced it as such. “Boston’s a really cool film community, and I wish students took more advantage of it,” said John P. Harrison III ’09. “It’s kind of hard to escape the Harvard campus.” Eliora M. Noetzel ’10 has had exactly that difficulty. “I’ve not been to many film festivals, because getting off campus is not something I do often,” she said. “We’re lucky to have the HFA [Harvard Film Archive] here, and we have a lot of people that come here specifically to present work, so we don’t really have to leave.”
In some ways, this shelter effect can be beneficial; as students, Harvard filmmakers do not have to face the harsh realities of the suffering film industry. As a newcomer, McGlade has already encountered difficulties in finding a distributor for “Guy and Madeline.” “This year, last year, financially everyone’s taken a hit, and distributors aren’t taking the same risks that they used to,” said McGlade. “It’s been a really tough year for independent film.”
Film industry professionals feel similarly. Patrick Jerome, Director of the Boston International Film Festival, reported that many film festivals—like CineVegas and the Hollywood Black Film Festival—have been cancelled this year. “Film festivals depend on a good economy to survive,” Jerome said.
In response to the economic downturn, the number of films produced a year has been dropping. In 2008, 520 films were produced by the major studios. The projection for 2010 is between 300 and 400. From the point of view of a distributor, the bar has been raised. “You’re making fewer films, and being more careful about the ones you’re choosing, so it’s harder to get funding,” McGlade said. “People aren’t getting the same amount of money for deals.”
Robin Dawson, who was Massachusetts State Film Commissioner for 10 years and is now the Executive Director of the Boston Film Festival, has a more optimistic view for the future of independent film. “I think the independent industry will start to maybe benefit from the studios putting out less films a year,” she said. “I anticipate that more indies will be picked up and distributed by the studios.”
REELING IN FILMS
Boston itself, however, has been somewhat sheltered from this effect due to the Film Tax Credit, which was instated in 2006. Since its implementation, there has been a steady increase in the number of films produced in Boston. “Boston, as a result of a tax break for films, is kind of crazy. It’s become this huge haven for feature films,” said Horovitz. Martin Scorsese’s “The Departed” and “Shutter Island” are two such films shot in Boston since the tax credit.
From Horovitz’s perspective as a Production Assistant working on high-budget fiction filming in the area, shooting has noticeably taken off in the last year or two—but not only due to tax credits. “People are realizing it’s much easier to shoot in Boston than in New York,” he said. “In New York, there’s so many permits you have to get, and it’s so bureaucratic.”
Moreover, productions are ironically smoother in Boston because Bostonians are so unused to them. “In places like the Village, people are so overloaded by film shooting there, they just hate it,” Horovitz said. “Boston [is the] opposite. People are so excited to have films here, they just love it. Last year, people were like, ‘Oh, my God, Mel Gibson’s coming here, that’s awesome!’ The people are great.” It seems that film in Boston—and at Harvard—will continue to thrive.

The Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) performed Beethoven’s Third (“Eroica”) and Fourth Symphonies under James Levine on February 19 with an ironically self-possessed mood of adolescent naïveté. Cleverly and convincingly, the BSO managed to make the Beethoven symphonies come alive with a sense of artistic honesty and real intensity of spirit.
The two symphonies, often pointed to as the first flowering of Beethoven’s full Romanticism, are suffused with an emotional variety and exuberance that often gets suffocated under the reverence bestowed upon them as artistic milestones. An institution as well established as the BSO and a conductor as august as Levine could easily compound the problem, but they proved to be far too skillful to fall into such a trap.  They chose to take on a role—not that of the priestly stewards of sacred sound, but almost that of a preternaturally talented youth orchestra playing the “Eroica” for the very first time. It is high praise rather than understatement to call the performance “fun.”
In some sense, repertory concerts are artistically riskier than premieres. Both performers and listeners tend to engage new music with greater spontaneity and sincerity. To the audience, novelty grants the right to have an opinion; to the musicians, it offers a chance to experiment, play, and even occasionally be less than perfect.
In contrast, performances from the standard repertoire, like the Beethoven symphonies, offer dozens of ways to lapse into ceremonious inauthenticity. The audience, aware that they are listening to a top orchestra under a celebrated conductor performing the masterworks of one of the greatest composers, strains to rise to the occasion with a reaction of appropriate greatness. When the quality of the composition and the technique of the performer are beyond dispute, the audience’s response is a foregone conclusion, and the concert becomes a set of protocols rather than a genuine performance.
For the performers, then, the challenge of crafting a concert of canonical anchors like the Beethoven symphonies is to avoid easy recourse to the habit of flawless dignity. Consummate artistry involves not only the meaningful realization of a composition, but the further ability to destroy and then resurrect its grandeur—to connect with the inner greatness of the work while stripping away the pomp that surrounds it. The goal is for the audience to like it not because they are supposed to, but because they can’t help it.
Levine is excellent at making Beethoven into less of a god and more of a human. He visibly and audibly revels in the symphonies, and one of the many joys of being in the concert hall rather than listening to a recording is in catching the gleeful brio Levine exudes. Sitting rather than standing at the podium (due to well-chronicled health problems over the past four years), he swivels fluidly back and forth like a six-year old left alone in a big office chair, dancing his feet across a wooden support bar like some frenetic organist pedaling a Reger fugue. Occasionally, you could hear him calling “Dyet! Dyet! Dyet!” in the syncopated passages of the first movement of the “Eroica” or loudly exhaling a sensual, satisfied “Syaaah!” at the climax of the second movement of the Fourth. While a certain sort of listener might find those noises distracting, it is energizing to realize that the even best conductors love the music they do because it fills them with the same sort of impulse to sing along and dance that anyone catches from music they love.
The Fourth Symphony actually preceded the Third on the program, a decision that allowed the concert to end with the somewhat more invigorating finale of the latter—but also prevented the subtler charms of the less frequently performed Fourth from disappearing beneath the pyrotechnics of its younger sibling. Levine’s rendition of the Fourth danced ahead at a quicker pace than most performances, particularly in the second and third movements, but on the whole the sprightly tempo allowed a refreshing balance of line and punch where one is normally sacrificed for the other.
The emotional gamut spanned by the “Eroica” gave it the flavor of a show piece, but that never cheapened it—in fact, the extra swagger affected by the BSO is really something missing from other interpretations.  Sterling solo and ensemble work in the wind section stood out in the third movement, as in the symphony as a whole. Even in the dolorous intensity of the second movement, the emphasis on the starkness of the horns turned Beethoven’s exploration of grief into more of a public ritual of loss than an introverted sorrow—another interpretive move that helped the concert transcend the typical Beethoven performance.
As the BSO, like all orchestras, works hard to expose new audiences to the world of classical music, repertory concerts continue to play a disproportionate role in drawing first-time listeners. As the music world tries to balance the demands of sustaining the canon with its mission to discover and promote new works in the classical tradition, it becomes all the more pressing that repertory concerts speak with the same immediacy and freshness as “new music” performances if there is to be any audience left at all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Taking food from Annenberg is a daring endeavor. On one hand, the ready-to-go, cooked food is an inviting target for swiping and eating later. On the other hand, Harvard University Dining Services forbids students from taking food outside of the dining hall. As the students and HUDS clash, awkwardness, confusion, and hungry stomachs prevail. It seems clear that HUDS must get a better handle on dining hall food theft and regulate the current black market of hot meal smuggling. Although bagged meals are provided, Annenberg has no substitute for missing a hot meal. Allowing students to take a regulated amount of food out of their dining hall will remedy this problem and eliminate the awkwardness and ambiguity.
The reason people take food is that it is cooked, unlike pre-ordered HUDS meals, and easy to steal. My HUDS, a service that allows students to order bag meals that they can quickly pick up, is a helpful option; however, eating a cold ham and lettuce sandwich is a much different experience than eating a steaming hot eggplant parmesan sandwich. We are paying a hefty fee for our meal plan, with an individual dinner for a guest costing fifteen dollars without tax. We should be able to get the most out of this price. It makes little sense to drain our limited BoardPlus, or spend actual cash, on cooked food when there is a good, “free” alternative. (Thus, stealing is in some ways a compliment to the taste quality of HUDS cooking.) Additionally, the food presented in a buffet style seems to be begging to be taken out in as many Ziplocs and Tupperware containers as possible. The ease makes students often feel it is their right to take food out of the dining hall.
In fact, the stockpiling of edibles that frequently occurs in response to this situation is regrettable. HUDS purchases food to accommodate the size of the freshman class, while possibly assuming that some might be taking a little bit of food out of the dining hall. However, those students who hoard enormous quantities of food into their bags are putting a strain on the dining hall and costing the university. It should not be overlooked that HUDS does a great job of keeping costs down as the percent change in board costs has been lower than peer institutions like Yale and Stanford over the last few years, but the increased food consumption should not dramatically affect costs. Most Annen-burglars are not hoarders: They just want to take the occasional item because they know they will be hungry later and do not want to spend extra money buying food outside the dining hall. Annenberg’s prohibition of this kind of “stealing” is unfair.
A compromise between Annen-burglars and HUDS regarding food removal could be reached if the university gave every student a medium, reusable plastic container with the approximate food capacity of a single plate at the beginning of the year. The container could be called EAT, Exiting Annenberg Tupperware, and every freshman would be encouraged to only take food out of Annenberg in an EAT.
Ideally, an EAT box would be about the size of half a bread loaf and would only hold about a standard plate’s worth. This would allow students to possibly take a burger, some pasta, or a few brownies but nothing that would truly strain the cafeteria. Thus, the net effect could be that less food gets taken out than that which is removed under the current system. Former thieves can leave their criminal pasts behind and find redemption in the new system of taking food. And as the commonplace act of taking food out of the dining hall becomes regulated, actually invidious food stealing could be punished deservedly.
Granting official recognition to Annen-burglary will also help Annenberg keep sanitary conditions up, given that a chief concern of HUDS is that food taken back to the room will go bad. To address this problem, Annenberg should support the EAT program by offering to wash and clean the containers.
Would there still be people trying to cheat the system? Of course. But these burglars should face tougher penalties as a result. With this clear distinction, the now ambiguous and unfair system of taking food out of our dining hall will disappear. A compromise between now-hungry criminals and concerned HUDS enforcers can make the overall dining experience a more positive one.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For many, “queer” is not an immediately definable word. Some people only know the word from “Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” and thus derive the meaning from a show centered on fashion and style. To some it means “homosexual,” while to some it means “gay,” and still to others it may imply bi- or pan-sexuality. As such, we applaud the Queer Students and Allies’ recent decision to change its mission statement to include the more widely encompassing terms “questioning and allied students,” as well as QSA’s initiative to incorporate more ethnic and cultural identities into its work. We feel that QSA’s revamping of its goals is a positive step toward creating a more comprehensive and representative student group that will thereby be better able to cater to its members and Harvard’s population as a whole.
We hope that the QSA will follow this announcement with actions that show it truly desires a broader and more diverse base of members. The new mission statement implies that the QSA intends to move in a more inclusive direction, rather than remain mainly a support group for queer students. As such, we feel it would be an excellent move on the QSA’s part to host campus events that not only promote awareness of queer culture and issues but also are directed at students of all sexualities in an attempt to promote greater intercultural understanding and acceptance.
Specifically, the QSA should focus on breaking down the stereotypes associated with LGBTQ issues, from issues of social justice to everyday life. It is important for people to know that the problems faced by these groups are not simply ghettoized or sequestered to one portion of the population. We feel it is important, therefore, to focus on outreach not only to persons struggling with issues of sexuality but also to those who want to know more about the queer culture, and perhaps help those who need it in “coming out.”
Moreover, the QSA would undoubtedly benefit from spreading awareness about queer culture and issues to the rest of campus. Positive public relations, especially in this time of tumultuous social change, is something from which the QSA could greatly benefit. We applaud the QSA in rewriting its mission statement to promote its goal of becoming a more open, inclusive community. Identity is a complicated entity, and this is a development that, if handled correctly, will hopefully lead to a more thorough and open on-campus dialog about issues of identity and sexuality.

Fielding reader outrage over Kelly Clarkson’s shameless slimming on the September cover of Self, Editor-in-Chief Lucy Danzinger crafted an online retort. After insisting that cover shots on her monthly glossy are fastidious constructions—products of “art, creativity, and collaboration”—rather than documentary snapshots, she proceeded to distinguish between journalistic “news photographs” and other images, like Clarkson’s, that “inspire women to want to be their best.” “Did we publish an act of fiction? No,” Danzinger asserted. “Not unless you think all photos are that. But in the sense that Kelly is the picture of confidence, and she truly is, then I think this photo is the truest we have ever put out there on the newsstand.”
According to Danzinger’s diagnosis, Clarkson suffers from a brand of bipolar disorder: Her external self, marred by unsightly bulk, both obscures and undermines her inner self, which is effervescent, confident, and considerably slimmer. Thin on the inside, heavy on the outside, Clarkson’s appearance must be altered to evoke her “truest” inner essence. While truth generally refers to an objective, verifiable (or, at least, not unverifiable) fact, Danzinger’s bizarre definition conflates truth with artfulness, alteration, and artificial reality. In Danzinger’s logic, manipulating Kelly’s cover shot with computer software only makes her look more like herself—or rather, more like her “best self.” Here, the camera does not capture reality: It manufacturers its own, transforming Clarkson into the imitation of some other, skinnier person.
It’s difficult to believe that Danzinger actually believes her own doublespeak. “Whether she is up or down in pounds is irrelevant,” she stresses; yet, the cover’s Photoshop crash diet affirms just the opposite. Clarkson’s weight is eminently relevant—so relevant, in fact, that by Danzinger’s account, an untoned tummy will not only prevent the magazine from selling, but, more disturbingly, will forestall the revelation of Clarkson’s “spirit” and “personality.” Inner beauty, it seems, is conditioned on outer beauty; lacking the latter, the former becomes inconsequential. The text on the cover—“Stay True to You and Everyone Else Will Love You, Too!”—only exacerbates the irony of the accompanying image and Danzinger’s equivocations. Extolling Clarkson’s inner virtues, Danzinger’s words ring hollow when compared with the magazine’s actions, which expose the superficial as all-important and all there is.
Clarkson’s slim down, though significant, remains restrained, at least relative to her airbrushed counterparts. Take, for example, a Ralph Lauren ad, run in Japan this fall, which features model Filippa Hamilton, her waist truncated to a grotesque extreme. So obviously distorted, the image becomes comical; it is difficult to imagine a viewer mistaking Hamilton’s form, stretched and squeezed to impossible proportions, for anything but a caricature of the feminine. The image’s shock derives not from the revelation that the culture industry fetishizes female thinness—that, unfortunately, is old news—but that it has assumed such consummate control over the definition of the female body, to the point where even the absurdly artificial is marketed as natural and ideal.
In the space of the cover shot and the advertisement, the subject has lost control over her own image. Imagistic distortion has become so normalized that unaltered photographs now run with special headlines, reinforcing the status of the non-airbrushed as an aberration. That the camera can serve as an instrument of fakery and fraud should not come as a surprise. Combined with our ability to laugh at Hamilton’s fun-house form, opining on irresponsible Photoshopping feels a bit overdrawn. The crux of the problem, however, lies not in extreme examples—here, the illusion is obvious—but in more discrete imagings, like Self’s September cover. Such subtle alterations, inconspicuous enough to pass as sincere, have profound implications, both for our sense of ourselves and for our sense of the real.
Indeed, although viewers can easily dismiss Hamilton’s head-to-waist ratio as obscene, Clarkson’s retouching toes a decidedly finer line. The cover shot exploits photography’s promise of absolute transparency, passing off a visual chimera—half-human, half-computer—for the real deal; Danzinger’s admission, of course, only followed in the wake of controversy. The image, in fact, seems more accurately classed as a painted portrait than a photograph. Yet, while the viewer approaches the former with suspicion, understanding its status as a selective idealization of reality, the latter medium demands the viewer’s complete credulity. While Danzinger acknowledges that the image is artful—the product of good lighting, stylized poses, and an ever-euphemistic “postproduction process”—she neglects to mention that this artfulness is masquerading as authenticity.
As graphic artist Barbara Kruger enjoins over a photograph of a woman’s face, fragmented in the reflection of a shattered mirror, “you are not yourself”—a caption seemingly readymade for Clarkson’s cover and Hamilton’s advertisement. Reality, it seems, sells neither magazines nor designer jeans. Female consumers desire products that promise to improve upon their biological givens, even if the standard to which they aspire is unrealistic or, worse yet, consciously fabricated. Treatments that purport to rejuvenate, lift, and strengthen—to transform us into our “best selves,” as Danzinger would quip—are tolerated, even demanded, so long as they make us look more “natural,” where “natural” denotes an ineffable standard of bodily perfection. Hopefully, one day, photographs can reflect the real without caveat; until then, ridiculing Hamilton-esque hack jobs is the best a critic can do.

The aim of public diplomacy is to communicate America’s policies abroad and to engage international audiences about all things American. The problem is, we’re failing, and that’s to the detriment of our national security as well as commercial, cultural, and education interests.
America’s public diplomacy has a budget of about one billion dollars a year and a staff of thousands of foreign service officers and civil servants who are engaging in, among other things, broadcasting in 53 languages, staffing exchanges, deciding on Fulbright fellowships, and building websites. Since 2001, budgets and staff have increased and, in all fairness, exchanges, broadcasting to Arabic-speaking countries, and Internet tools have improved.  But the question remains—are we better able to communicate with the world today than we were before 9/11? The increased budgets, augmented staff, and more modern websites were necessary but insufficient upgrades.
And that is a travesty, because the U.S. is the world’s driver of technology. Google, Twitter, Facebook, and the iPad were all born in America. Likewise, other goods and services produced by American corporations are equally popular in the U.S. and abroad. And American culture—from movies to music to TV—is a key American export.
In terms of the public sector, U.S. government programs are also the envy of the world. NASA, the U.S. government’s space agency, is the unquestionable leader in exploring our universe. The National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide much of the cutting-edge medicine in the world. And those are just two of a host of extraordinary government programs.
A recent Gallup survey of Global Perceptions of U.S. Leadership shows that the median approval of American leadership in the world jumped from 34 percent in 2008 to 51 percent in 2009—a change that is attributable to the change from the Bush to Obama administration. This buttresses the common perception that President Obama is at least as popular with international audiences as with American ones.
But despite all this, our ability to communicate with the world is still broken. How can we channel the international popularity of our president to engage international audiences?
One of the biggest criticisms is misguided—that American policies stink to some of our key audiences, and if we are going to reengage in a meaningful way with the world, those policies must change.
Let’s talk about this “policy question” for a minute. During the Cold War, it was in the interest of key European allies and the U.S. to position nuclear weapons on European soil, an act that caused much disdain among rank and file European populations. But America and our allies went ahead with these installations. We didn’t change our policies to encourage people to like us. Rather, we stood our ground in favor of our national interest and earned the respect, if not the admiration, of our tentative audiences. There are lots of lessons to be drawn from this on how to engage hostile audiences, but instead, there seems to be a knee-jerk reaction to blame policies as an easy way to explain away the more complex problem.
Because there are procedural problems that need work, since 9/11 a bunch of well-meaning and very smart people have looked at this issue and identified a few things that need fixing. One compelling and frequent finding concerns the nature of our messages to our key audiences. The consensus maintains that our messages are at best poorly received by “the Arab street,” and in some cases, insulting. Not only do we have an inadequate number of Arabic-speaking foreign service officers but our communications are also hindered by an absence of meaningful cultural sensitivity. Another common finding is that there is “insufficient” bureaucratic coordination from the White House.  Additionally, there are too many educational and cultural exchanges with historical Cold War allies and too few with people of countries less friendly to America today. Our international broadcasting has few devotees.
America needs a new way of communicating with the world. We don’t just need new tools, although some new tools will be useful. We don’t just need to fix the bureaucratic process, which is rife with power plays between the State and Defense Departments. These are just some of the problems; the fixes are wonky, legislative, and statutory.
We need a call to action—we need a nod from our president that demonstrates how important it is for America to effectively communicate with the world and to remind us that Americans traveling and living abroad are as much U.S. ambassadors as the Senate-confirmed official representatives.
Let’s end this debate about why America has an international communications problem and start figuring out how to fix it with common-sense solutions, new technology, and a new generation of diplomats to tell our story to the world.

Making life easier for students who want to get meals, exercise, or do laundry without facing fickle Cambridge weather, Winthrop House has given students direct access to a formerly locked basement.
The House removed tables and chairs from the basement last week between the H entryway and the I and J entryways in Gore Hall. Winthrop students had asked for access to the area as recently as last Friday in a series of messages over the House’s e-mail list.
But House administrators cautioned that the basement’s opening was only “temporary.”
“The basements will be open as long as nothing disappears from the basements. So don’t steal anything!” a Winthrop House Committee member wrote in an e-mail over the House list last weekend.
The H entryway houses the dining hall, while a gym and laundry room are in the J entryway. The I entryway is located between the two.
The basement had been locked so that Winthrop superintendent David Simms could store furniture that would otherwise be susceptible to theft or loss, according to Winthrop House administrator Joanna G. Miller.
Despite references to “tunnels” over the Winthrop e-mail list, only a basement has been opened—not one of the underground Harvard University Dining Services tunnels that connect several River Houses, according to Miller.
Those tunnels, which run under Mill Street, allow underground access from the Lowell and Winthrop House dining halls to the loading dock between Eliot and Kirkland Houses. HUDS uses the tunnels to move and store food for Lowell and Winthrop Houses, and as a space for washing dishes.
But for undergraduate residents yearning to navigate the River Houses subterraneanly, opening the HUDS tunnels will continue to be just a pipe dream, according to Miller.
“Those aren’t areas students would ever be able to use,” Miller said.
Unlike in other River Houses, Winthrop residents cannot traverse their House underground, as many of the entryways are not connected by accessible basements.
The entryways are fragmented into three groups: A and B are connected; C, D, and E are linked; and H, I, and J are newly enjoined.
Christian E. Free ’10, who lives in H entryway, said he did not know that the basement had been opened, but said that he was “very glad” now that he will have underground access to the laundry room.
“It’s nice to not have to trudge outside when the weather’s not too good,” added fellow H-entryway resident Trevor A. Groce ’10.

Jeff Garlin—a comedian who plays Larry David’s manager on the HBO series “Curb Your Enthusiasm”—will be honored as the first “Immediate Gratification Player of the Year” at an IGP comedy show on March 6.
The Immediate Gratification Players, one of two Harvard improvisational comedy groups, inaugurated the award earlier this year.
Garlin is slated to perform a guest monologue at the IGP’s show. The event will include an awards ceremony, where instead of receiving a medal or trophy, Garlin will be awarded his own red-and-yellow necktie, an IGP hallmark.
Best known for executive producing and co-starring in “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” Garlin also provided the voice for the spaceship captain in the movie “WALL-E.” He has appeared in television shows including “Arrested Development,” “Everybody Loves Raymond,” and “The Daily Show.”
Garlin is joining the ranks of Justin Timberlake and Wyclef Jean—two other celebrities recently selected as honorees of the year by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations, respectively.
“There are other groups who bring celebrities to campus, but what’s different about our award is we’re trying to celebrate someone who is a comedian first and foremost,” IGP Czar Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 said.
Levin-Gesundheit added that Garlin was selected because he began his acting career in improvisation. Garlin was a member of The Second City, a well-known improv theatre in Chicago that has housed celebrity comics including Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch.
“He’s done improv comedy, he’s done stand-up comedy, he’s produced movies and directed,” said IGP member Benjamin W.K. Smith ’12, who also heads On Thin Ice, Harvard’s other improv troupe. “He’s done it all in terms of the comedy scene.”
Though Garlin is the first to receive this honor, Levin-Gesundheit said he hopes the troupe will give additional “Immediate Gratification Player of the Year” awards in the coming years.
“We’re hoping to give this award as much as possible, devaluing it to the point where it basically means nothing,” Levin-Gesundheit said.

The Cambridge City Council elected Councillor David P. Maher as the mayor of Cambridge for the 2010-2011 term yesterday, after seven deadlocked attempts.
The Council also voted unanimously to elect Councillor Henrietta J. Davis as vice mayor.
Before the final motion to make the votes unanimous, Maher received six votes, more than the majority necessary to be elected. Davis followed with three.
In his inauguration speech, Maher emphasized the large impact that the current struggling economy is having on both individuals and businesses in the Cambridge community.
"Immediately, we have to get the city financial situation straightened right away," Maher said in an interview during a brief recess after the election.
As mayor, Maher will also chair the Cambridge School Committee, where he said he is ready to address an outstanding proposal that Cambridge ought to establish a middle school. Cambridge currently has kindergarten through eigth grade schools, but no middle school system.
The mayoral election process was expedited last night when Councillor Marjorie C. Decker motioned to move the voting process to the top of the agenda.
"We have to ask ourselves, if there is no mayor, and there [are] no committee assignments to chair, then what does the City Council do?" Decker said. "We cannot effectively advocate for public policy."
Prior to the formal elections, Decker gave a speech during which she publically explained her decision to change her vote from Councillor Kenneth E. Reeves ’72 to Maher.
Decker said she had previously described the mayoral election process as a "combination for the game of chess and the T.V. show "Survivor."
"It’s not pretty," she said of the procedure governing the mayoral election process, “but these are the rules that have been given to us.”
Former Mayor E. Denise Simmons followed Decker in acknowledging that the complicated procedures has its benefits.
“Although the process seems a bit difficult, it is the process, and it is democracy, and it gives us an opportunity to continue to discuss with each other in an informal context,” Simmons said.
“When someone wins, someone loses; I want to say that we all win because we have outstanding individuals that [ran] for mayor.”
Simmons added that because she has had experience serving as mayor, she recognizes that the person to take on the position has taken on both responsibility and privilege.
Maher said that despite the long race, he still believed he “did it the right way.”
In his inauguration speech, Maher reflected on his first political campaign in 1987, when his slogan was “a young and energetic voice for the future of Cambridge.” But, Maher said, that time of youth has passed and it is the force of experience that has gotten him this far.

Former Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson, Jr. managed to maintain a sense of humor while speaking at the Institute of Politics yesterday about the recent financial crisis and his personal experience with decision making in the difficult environment.
Last night’s event was sponsored by the Center for Public Leadership and the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business & Government and moderated by Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen before a full audience.
Paulson—who graduated from Harvard Business School in 1970—said that when he first assumed his post as Secretray of the Treasury, he recognized problems building up in the financial system and that the United States was “overdue” for a financial crisis.
“I don’t know what will cause the crisis, but after the fact it will be painfully obvious,” he had told the former President George W. Bush.
Dealing with the financial crisis was “an all out race to stave off disaster,” Paulson said last night. He added that he never let himself think about the possibility that the financial system would fail, although it was “on the brink” at times.
Paulson also said that he was able to pick up on potential problems that might not have affected constituents for another four or six weeks, but that Congress was often hesitant to address issues without immediate implications.
“It’s very difficult to get Congress to act on anything that is big and complex and controversial if there is not an immediate crisis,” he said.
“What is the best way to get action in Washington before things build up the way they did?” Gergen asked.
“David, I don’t know,” Paulson responded, prompting laughter from the audience.
In his conversation with Gergen, Paulson said that in the months preceding the economic crisis that dominated 2007, the most important action he took was to work on building relationships with the President and with Congress. He also stressed the importance of fast decision making with incomplete information once the actual financial downturn hit.
“In a number of instances, we were forced to make decisions very quickly, and we knew that sometimes they would have unattractive consequences,” he said, adding that such decisions had to be modified as events unfolded.
The event ended with questions from the audience.
Kennedy School student Sebastian M. Litta asked whether Paulson thought that the greed of both bankers and ordinary people would eventually go away or whether greed would cause another financial crisis.
Paulson responded that while editing his memoir—“On the Brink: Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System”—he had changed the word “greed” to “profit motive.” According to Paulson, this desire for profit would not dissipate, which is why regulatory systems are necessary.
Several undergraduates in attendance said they enjoyed the event overall.
“It’s great to get a first-hand perspective because he was in the center of this [economic crisis],” Claudio X. Gonzalez ’13 said.
But Alexandru Chivescu ’13 said that he wished Paulson would have discussed more explanation for some of Paulson’s decisions.
“It was pretty general, which was okay, given the nature of the venue,” Chivescu said. “[But] I definitely wanted to know more about the decision he made concerning Lehman Brothers.”

At least nine downspouts—vertical pipes located on the outside of buildings, which carry rainwater from rain gutters to ground level—went missing from Eliot and Lowell Houses last week. Each pipe is valued at roughly $500.
On the morning of Feb. 18, Eliot House Building Manager Francisco Medeiros noticed that roughly ten feet of the bottom half of a twenty foot downspout on O entryway was missing. He immediately reported it to Harvard University Police Department.
The next morning, during a weekly tour of the buildings’ exteriors, Lowell House Crew Chief Luis Colon noticed that ten downspouts were missing from several Lowell entryways, according to Lowell House Building Manager Robert Sammonds. Colon subsequently told Sammonds, who immediately informed HUPD.
While Sammonds said that there were ten downspouts stolen from Lowell House, HUPD Spokesman Steven G. Catalano said that only eight were reported missing.
Catalano said that the Eliot House theft likely took place between Feb. 3 and Feb. 17, and that the Lowell House theft likely took place between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15.
The reasons for the thefts remain unclear, but Catalano wrote in an e-mail that it was likely due to the value of the copper pipes.
"The theft of copper products is not an uncommon occurrence and has peaked within the last few years with the increase in recycle value of copper," he wrote. "We generally see one or two copper thefts on campus each year."
Sammonds also thought that the theft was probably related to the pipes’ market price.
"Someone must have thought they were worth something, but it wasn’t worth their effort," he said.
Both Medeiros and Sammonds said they thought it was unlikely that students had committed the crime.
"If it was just one missing, I would say it was just kids," Sammonds said. "But with ten missing, I thought differently."
Medeiros noted that it would be difficult to such hide large pipes. "I have to check all the student rooms," he joked.

In front of an amused, though small, audience, Young America’s Foundation spokesman Jason Mattera mocked feminism and homosexuality during a panel at the Conservative Political Action Conference last Thursday in Washington, D.C.
Some conservatives on campus said that Mattera misrepresented their views on such issues.
“When liberals talk about diversity, they never mean offering students a wide variety of ideas, including conservative ones. Their version of diversity is bizarre,” he said, citing various college courses—including classes on “Native American Feminism,” “Cyber-Feminism,” and “one that deconstructs the feminist new black man”—to prove his point.
But Mattera’s comments were not characteristic of Republican attitudes in general, according to Mark A. Isaacson ’11, president of the Harvard Republican Club, who attended CPAC, but not the panel at which Mattera spoke.
Isaacson described the talk as “a few poor attempts at clever one-liners, rather than a discussion of diversity.”
“Comments like [Mattera’s] don’t accomplish anything other than eliciting some nervous laughter, and do absolutely nothing to attract new young voters or build the Republican Party,” he said.
Women and Gender Studies concentrator Andrés Castro Samayoa ’10 said he personally took issue with Mattera’s notion of diversity.
“For me, diversity is being able to appreciate and welcome various points of view,” Castro Samayoa said. “I’ve had the opportunity to study something that has expanded my horizons and allowed me to see the world in a new light.”
“It’s perplexing to see someone say that the study of feminism doesn’t speak to diversity,” he added, calling Mattera’s view on feminism narrow.
Linda Ellison, a lecturer in the Women and Gender Studies Department, said that feminism encompasses a diversity of issues that have implications beyond courses on theory.
“You don’t just read a book, take a test, and leave it in class—it’s something you can take to the streets,” she said.
According to Ellison, some of her former students have found practical uses for the feminist and diversity theories they learned in her classes.
Katherine A. Thurber ’11, who took one of Ellison’s classes last year, is planning to spend this summer in Uganda, where she will help establish a malnutrition program with the Harvard Global Hunger Initiative.
“The class gave me a new perspective on the importance of sexuality and gender,” Thurber said. “You have to look at a lot of different viewpoints to have an understanding of different issues and responses.”
Currently, Ellison teaches a class titled “Cultures of Reproduction,” and she said that conservative students in the class seem to have approached class themes such as abortion and premarital sex with an open mind.
“They are thinking about their values in a way they’re not used to,” she said. “Their belief systems are challenged, and it’s a challenge they’re willing to take on.”
Isaacson said that young conservatives should not condemn others’ perspectives.
“Exposure to a diversity of opinion, of course, is valuable—no matter what your politics are,” Isaacson added.

Despite the apparent improvement of the fiscal climate, the number of Americans facing unemployment continues to rise—and several Harvard economists shared their insights on its ramifications for the jobless.
The New York Times reported on Saturday that individuals who formerly enjoyed the comforts of a middle-class lifestyle—dubbed the “new poor”—are now on the brink of poverty and subsisting on savings, unemployment benefits, and various forms of public assistance.
The recession has disproportionately affected “men, workers from goods producing industries, young workers, and non-college workers,” according to Economics Professor Lawrence F. Katz’s prepared testimony for a Congressional hearing about the road to economic recovery.
There is a connection between the education level of workers and the economic downturn’s effect on their employment status, according to Christopher L. Foote, visiting economics lecturer.
Expanding on this theme, Senior Economics Lecturer Jeffrey A. Miron said that he is not worried about the job prospects of Ivy League graduates because the “top of the pecking order” will have more job options as a result of their elite backgrounds in education.
But blue collar workers and those without higher education will have to wait longer for employment opportunities, according to Miron.
In addition, if people remain unemployed for a long period of time, they will “get poor, suffer, and be more willing to consider jobs that are not their ideal jobs,” Miron said.
Since December 2007, around the start of the recession, employment has fallen by 8.4 million jobs. The unemployment rate continued to rise during 2009 despite a stabilization of the job opening rate, according to Katz’s report.
As a result of the increase in the unemployment rate, the amount of public assistance necessary to help the jobless has risen—which has played a role in the United States’ ballooning budget deficit, according to Miron.
But Foote said that the problem of public assistance for the unemployed is not as serious as most suggest.
“We’ve had recessions in the past,” Foote added.
Some labor experts have mentioned the “powerful expansions” that generally follow economic downturns of great magnitude—but there remain doubts that hiring will be able to absorb the millions of unemployed people, the Times reported.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the last two regular-season games of her college career, Harvard women’s hockey senior Randi Griffin bid farewell in decorated fashion. Netting a total of four goals against St. Lawrence (15-12-7, 11-8-3 ECAC) and No. 6 Clarkson (20-9-5, 14-5-3), Griffin helped the No. 4 Crimson (18-6-5, 13-6-3) clinch pivotal home-ice advantage in the upcoming playoffs and inch closer to the dream of hoisting a national championship.
On Friday night against St. Lawrence, the Crimson’s failure to convert on a power play early in the second period gave the Saints a 1-0 lead going into the third off. Harvard freshman Jillian Dempsey responded with her 10th goal of the season at 12:37 in the third period to tie the game. A delay-of-game penalty against St. Lawrence gave Griffin the ideal opening to showcase her skill and resolve as a veteran player.
With 25 seconds remaining in the game, Griffin sealed the Saints’ fate, outmaneuvering goalie Maxie Weisz on a penalty shot for the win.
And if Friday’s performance wasn’t enough of an indication of Griffin’s progress over the course of this season, then Saturday’s showing against powerhouse Clarkson laid all doubts to rest. Griffin lit the lamp on three separate occasions in the second period, posting her first-ever career hat trick—a natural hat trick, given that her goals came in succession in one period.
The Golden Knights’ Dominique Thibault robbed the Crimson of a win with a game-tying goal at 13:35 of the third, and Harvard later failed to capitalize on two penalties in overtime. But with Griffin’s top-notch performance and the 3-3 draw, the Crimson secured a third-place finish in the final league standings and thus home-ice advantage in the first round of the ECAC Women’s Hockey Tournament.
Harvard kicks off the playoffs against sixth-seeded Princeton (13-12-4, 11-7-4) this weekend.
“I think it was one of those days where the puck was on my stick, and the shots were going my way,” Griffin said of her success. “Some days they go in; others, they don’t. I was just fortunate.”
The seemingly good fortune shouldn’t fool anyone who’s been tracking the senior’s game play and dedicated work ethic throughout the season. Griffin also attributes her success to pinpointing the weaknesses in her game early in the summer months and putting in long hours to correct them.
“[For me], the summer leading up to the season involved working a lot on conditioning and consistency,” Griffin said. “That’s something we also didn’t have depth in as a team coming in. Everyone had to step up.”
Griffin’s season has been ripe with impressive showings against tough teams, including other game-winning goals against Dartmouth, Providence, and Union, but the forward struggled early on to fine-tune certain aspects of her game.
“One of my weaknesses has been my shot,” Griffin said. “I tend to score more in practice than in games. That has to do more with my hesitation, because I tend to want to [over]think when the puck is on my stick. In the past weeks, since I’ve been on the top two scoring lines, I’ve had coaches tell me that I have to get the puck off my stick much faster. And that definitely paid off against Clarkson.”
This weekend’s win against St. Lawrence and tie against Clarkson also allowed Griffin to play a part in making NCAA sports history, as Crimson coach Katey Stone tied Laura Halldorson’s record for all-time NCAA wins with 337.
“It felt really good [to be a part of the accomplishment],” Griffin said. “Coach is a very humble person, and that wasn’t her focus at all going into the games. It’s a great achievement for her.”
Griffin now has the chance to help Stone surpass the record with a win against the Tigers this weekend, and the momentum the senior has accumulated recently could be a huge asset. But Griffin is careful not to get complacent.
“Honestly, nothing’s really changed,” Griffin said. “I’m hoping to continue working hard. Hopefully, the puck will keep going in.”
Beyond her modesty and perseverance, Griffin is known for the distinct niche she occupies as a veteran member of the team.
“Randi’s not the most vocal of the seniors,” said teammate and junior forward Kate Buesser. “But she makes a big difference just bringing the Harvard hockey spirit alive. We have our captains, and then we have Randi, being a great complement to the other seniors. You can tell just by talking to her that she’s really here for the team and committed to helping us get back to the national championship.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Glancing at the whole of something doesn’t mean you understand all of its parts. Imagine this: you assume that Australia doesn’t have any decent winter athletes just because its total medal count—two—falls far behind winter powers such as the United States, Germany, and Norway, the current medal leaders. Then you’d be denying the existence of Australian Olympian Torah Bright, who took gold in the women’s half pipe, beating all the top U.S. riders in the process.
Likewise, it would be foolish to look at the Harvard ski team’s ninth-place finishes and assume that a top ski team, like the University of New Hampshire or Middlebury, could easily beat them in any given event.
To do so would be to discount the women’s Nordic team, a squad that has emerged this season as a consistent contender and a threat to some of the top programs in the country.
This past weekend at the Williams Ski Carnival, the team placed fifth in the 5k classic and sixth in the 5k free event.
To understand the magnitude of these results, it’s important to understand the caliber of the opponents they beat.
Take the University of New Hampshire for instance, whom the Crimson topped in the classic event. The Wildcats, lurking just behind the power struggle between the University of Vermont and league’s pacesetter Dartmouth, took third in the overall carnival scores and finished ninth at the NCAA Championships a year ago.
The win over Middlebury was arguably even more significant. The Panthers, as their website boasts, are the only NCAA team with two alums skiing in Vancouver, including Nordic skier Simi Hamilton, and the team took the eighth spot in last year’s national championships.
In addition to recent success at the national level, both of these schools—along with all of Harvard’s other Carnival competitors—have a clear advantage over the Crimson in one critical area.
Snow.
While last Tuesday’s snowfall satisfied many students’ long desire for a white winter, that day of frosting would hardly cut the cake up North, where ski resorts abound, and deep snow covers campuses all winter long.
All of which makes it even more impressive that Harvard’s skiers have been able to beat them in Nordic events.
And the way the Crimson has engineered these results suggest that it has a recipe for future success.
Unlike many upstart teams which are driven by one superstar and a lot of average-to-bad role players, the Harvard women’s Nordic team has ample competition at the top.
It doesn’t even have a top skier but rather a trio of top racers in captain Audrey Mangan and freshmen Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy. The three have exchanged places all season. Mangan led the way at the early races and the Williams Carnival races, while Tofte led the charge in the University of Vermont and Dartmouth Carnivals, with Kennedy right behind her. Junior Cara Sprague is not far behind these three and finished second on the team in the 15k free event in the St. Lawrence Carnival. Continued development of interchangeability will allow Harvard to compete against larger teams with great recruiting resources and a larger supply of reserves.
“It’s been great getting to know them and seeing the team coming together like a great group of friends,” Mangan said. “It definitely helps to have teammates that can push you a lot in practice. I’m really proud of them.”
And that’s where the freshmen come in. Because while Mangan’s career at Harvard ends this coming weekend at the EISA Championships, Tofte and Kennedy will be a big part of the Crimson’s success for years to come. Their emergence can help Harvard notch improved finishes, and these results can attract stronger recruiting classes in years to come.
But as Mangan’s skiing career closes out, her successes were hardly in vain. Not only has the senior turned in impressive performances on her own, but her improvement over her three years on the team (Mangan ran track freshman year) suggest that the Crimson may be better at developing talent than one might expect from its urban location.
And so long as the team keeps improving, its underdog status might prove attractive to recruits looking to make an impact. It’s not really fair to make the “any smart athlete would choose Harvard for its academics” argument when strong institutions such as Dartmouth and Williams sit above them in the standings, but an academic reputation certainly can’t hurt either.
So if the Crimson Nordic women’s success this past weekend went right over your head, don’t worry about it. It’ll happen again soon enough.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Always expect the unexpected.
I’ve probably heard this proverbial phrase a million times from my parents, but growing up, I really didn’t experience the so-called “unexpected”. What is it, and just what exactly does it mean?
My formative years seemed to embody the definition of a “normal” childhood: biking around town, taking violin lessons, doing well in school, and so on.
As I wrapped up my freshman year last spring, it appeared that everything was going just as I had planned. I thoroughly enjoyed my classes (yes, even Expos), I made new friends, and I finally found my extracurricular niche on campus as a Crimson Sports Board editor.
Like any ambitious freshman, I wanted to impress my superiors on the Board. I picked up stories that nobody wanted, and when I was elected, I picked up three beats–women’s basketball, track, and men’s volleyball. I picked up two more going into sophomore year, including the highly-coveted football beat.
Most importantly, though, I thought that I had my career plans all figured out. I would wrap up college, enter medical school, and fulfill my dream of becoming a doctor.
But all of this changed last summer.
Always expect the unexpected.
In the most unexpected time–early August last year–and in the most unexpected of places–on a bench in a research lab at The National Institutes of Health–I realized that something was missing; Despite setting all of those lofty goals for college and beyond, I had left behind one important part of me: my music.
All throughout high school, I was able to balance my academic pursuits with my violin studies. I took violin pretty seriously; I practiced three hours a day, and commuted three hours each way to study with a renowned professor (ok, maybe my childhood wasn’t that normal). By senior year, I seriously thought about becoming a violinist.
But with the lack of a performance program at Harvard, my inability to master the art of time management, and the lure of Harvard’s academic offerings, my musical ambitions quickly faded away and consequently fell down my list of priorities.
On that August morning though, it suddenly hit me that I wanted to give violin a chance as a profession. So why the change?
I guess the root of my indecision stems from my desire of avoiding the “what-if” question.
What if I’d only chosen medicine, and not liked it? What if I’d only chosen violin, and decided that it wasn’t for me? Given the difficulty of both professions–and the sheer amount of time needed for them–is it possible to be successful in one without precluding the other? If I love both, why must I give one up?
Regret has always been the one thing I’ve tried to avoid most, and that feeling of uncertainty dawned on me once again. A year later than expected, I was essentially back to square one. At a crossroads and forced to choose a path, I was afraid of making the wrong decision.
For the first time, I didn’t know how to handle the unexpected. So I did what I felt like then was the unthinkable: I took the fall semester off.
What made my decision so difficult wasn’t disappointing my parents, who come from a culture where academic life was the only path to a successful life, but rather, the fear of Harvard leaving me behind.
In particular, I was nervous about losing the friendships I had developed, the work I had put in as a Crimson sports editor (including giving up my beats), and just, in general, being out of the Harvard “loop”.
But obviously, soul searching took precedence, and leaving the comforts of the Harvard bubble was the only solution.
For an entire semester, I practiced six hours a day. I did nothing but play the violin, and music quickly became a part of my life again.
I occasionally got my fill of Harvard by emailing with blockmates and perusing The Crimson website. I even got to watch the Crimson’s thrilling come-from-behind victory at Yale on national television.
Before I knew it, the fall semester had come to an end, and I now find myself back in Cambridge with newly defined goals influenced by passion rather than expectations.
It’s been over a month now since my return, and it’s amazing to see just how much has changed for me over the course of a semester.
I’ve finally overcome that feeling of uncertainty. I’ve learned that music and medicine, at its core, are intrinsically connected in the sense that both serve as therapeutic treatments–one for the soul, the other for the body. I’ve learned that, with the right guidance, time management, and a bit of luck, it is indeed possible to become a doctor by day, violinist by night. As Yogi Berra said, “If you come to a fork in the road, take it!”
And I intend to do so.
From a sports point of view, I was impressed with just how many new players have dominated the Crimson sports scene. With freshmen such as Louis Leblanc, Victoria Lippert, and Kyle Casey leading their respective teams, I quickly had to learn—and relearn—a lot of names as a Sports writer. No more Chris Pizzotti ’08-’09 and Sarah Vallaincourt ’08-’09 tearing up the gridiron and ice, but rather, new faces like juniors Collier Winters and Liza Ryabkina leading the Crimson to successful seasons.
At the same time, I find it equally astonishing just how much has stayed the same. The anxiety I had of being left behind was quickly put to rest as I was welcomed back by my community in Currier House. My fellow editors at The Crimson made me feel like I hadn’t even left at all, as I felt as comfortable as ever walking into the Sports Cube to talk about sports.
In retrospect, my time away was at times difficult, frustrating, and lonely. Yet, it allowed me to discover what I’m most passionate about, and what I truly strive to be.
So what else did I learn from this whole experience?
Always expect the unexpected.

If you often have to put sleep down as a scheduled activity in your iCal, if you frequently miss meals because they aren't time-efficient, or if you panic when your shower is two minutes longer than planned, you might be a Harvard student—at least, according to this article in Harvard Magazine.
The article, which discussed the lives of over-scheduled Harvard undergraduates, highlighted the schedules of various students and noted that "students today routinely sprint through jam-packed daily schedules, tackling big servings of academic work plus giant helpings of extracurricular activity in a frenetic tizzy of commitments."
So why do we do this? What's so scary about having blank spots on our schedules?
“There are just so many opportunities available that if you're not doing something you feel like you're missing out on some opportunity." Carolina B. Beltran '13 told us. "Also, we're all overachievers and we want to maximize our time and get the most."
Beltran participates in a Christian fellowship group, is a director for the Summer Urban Program, and is the political chair for RAZA. When we asked how she thinks this culture of cramming affects her fellow students, she said, "Students don't know how to slow down and just take an hour for themselves, sit down and just breathe, or relax. They always feel like they have to be moving or doing something. I think in some sense that's good, but I think that a lot of students are unhealthy. I know people that don't sleep and skip meals all the time."
We Harvard students are certainly not unfamiliar with sleep deprivation. The article stated that varsity athletes, representing about 20 percent of undergraduates, seem to be the only sizable student category to sleep and rise at roughly conventional hours, according to Harry R. Lewis ’68, professor of computer science and former dean of Harvard College.
In our effort to be the best, we often hurt ourselves, Beltran said. "Students here need to learn how to take care of their bodies and their mental and emotional health."
So as you think about the six midterms, four papers, 25 hours of meetings, and that inconvenient activity know as sleep that you have to fit in next week, relax. We're all in this together. Take a break, see a Broadway show, take a trip out to Boston like you've always thought about doing, and for everyone's sake, remember that showers are never a waste of time.

An earlier version of this post stated incorrectly that Carolina B. Beltran '13 was featured in the Harvard Magazine article. In fact, she was not mentioned in the article.

UPDATED: Feb. 24, 2010, 8:03 p.m.
Around 10:40 p.m. yesterday, one of our correspondents walked by Bartley's and noticed that the front window had been shattered. As we reported earlier, the window was boarded up by 12:27 a.m.
So what happened outside of Bartley's last night? Here's the story, as promised.
According to Bill Bartley, the legendary owner of Mr. Bartley’s Gourmet Burgers, two "semi-intoxicated" college-aged males broke the glass yesterday around 9:30 p.m. While Bartley said he would not reveal their names, he confirmed that the two men were Harvard students. [UPDATE: Bartley now says he is not sure that the men are Harvard students.]
Most of the window remained intact, but the men left behind a circular hole in the glass storefront.
"It's just like what usually happens," Bartley told us. "They're wrestling and someone's butt goes through the glass."
After the accident, which took place while the restaurant was still open, one of the two students came forward and took responsibility for the broken window (five gold stars for you, perp #1). According to Bartley, that student convinced his cohort to return and "do the right thing" (hmm, maybe 3 gold stars for you, perp #2). Had the perpetrators tried to escape, though, they still could have been caught: the well-known burger joint is equipped with a security camera.
In Bartley's 38 years at the restaurant, the large 7 by 10 foot glass window has been broken about 4 times. The other, smaller glass window has been broken several times as well. "It is the nature of operating in a college town," Bartley said.
But the large window, which will be replaced on Thursday, is here to stay (insurance is expected to cover most of the damages). Bartley told us that the artist who has painted the colorful "Bartley's" on the window in years past will be called back to paint the new window.
Bartley said he could not imagine the restaurant any other way, adding that he would probably have to consult with Harvard and the city historical commission if he ever wanted to change the exterior of the building.
He also had some advice for the next drunken college student who decides to break a Bartley's window: "You should be breaking glass on Friday and Saturday nights. Not Monday nights. I'm there on Friday and Saturday nights when all the glass breaking should be happening. Not a Monday night. You kids should be studying."

“Yes, yes, we all know this already. Pfoho is the best house on campus,” said the former Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler with great conviction. His blockmates found it almost impossible to reveal the news. The housing assignments had arrived earlier that morning, dictating the lives of those four men for years to come. They had been placed in Adams. Pfoho was now only a dream.
This is just the beginning of a hilarious video, uploaded to YouTube on Monday, in which Pfoho flaunts its stuff using a comic clip that features Adams House, Hitler, and Hitler’s three blockmates.
The video, which employs a popular Internet meme, shows a scene from "Downfall"—a World War II film released in 2004. In the scene, Hitler berates his comrades in German after learning some disappointing news. The meme plays on the viewer’s inability to understand German and substitutes humorous English subtitles for the original dialogue.
With Housing Day around the corner, Pfoho’s video has started off the annual tumult of Housing Day propaganda. Last year, Mather House released its own popular video, which has accumulated 13,909 hits on YouTube.
Most students are adamant about not being Quaded, but Pfoho turns that on its head with its new video. Hitler, wanted—no, needed, Pfoho. And instead he got Adams.
In the video, Hitler provides a convincing case to make even the most adamant residents of Adams and other River houses question the quality of their homes. Boasting quiet meals, natural light, spacious rooms, clean interiors, and excellent parties, Pfoho is the only place Hitler wants to call home.
At the end of his emotional rant, Hitler slumps into his chair exhausted. With a soft voice, filled with sorrow and loss, he utters these bitter words: “I might as well transfer to Yale… FML."
