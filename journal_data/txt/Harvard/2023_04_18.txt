After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Boston Ballet’s showing of the iconic ballet “Don Quixote” fully lived up to its grand reputation with a cast that utterly dazzled, radiating pure technical precision and fierce energy. The show ran from March 16 through 26 and was the company’s first performance of the famous ballet in over a decade.
The show was staged by Rudolf Nureyev in 1982 for the Boston Ballet — with the famous ballerina and choreographer starring as Basilio in their original production — and features a larger-than-life cast of characters and a plot brimming with just the right balance of story and dance. An ailing Don Quixote (Paul Craig) follows his fancies of saving the beautiful Dulcinea (Chisako Oga) from wicked monsters, traveling into the village with his squire Sancho Panza (Isaac Abika). There, the headstrong Kitri (also played by Oga) wishes to marry flirtatious barber Basilio (Derek Dunn), but her father Lorenzo (Alec Roberts) won’t allow it, instead insisting that she marry a nobleman (Lawrence Rines Munro). Various hijinks ensue as Don Quixote involves himself in the conflict and the pair elope, following a wild chase through the Spanish countryside that culminates in a faked death, a hilarious duel, and a glorious wedding.
Everything was utterly exemplary, from the spectacular performances of the leads to the beautiful sets and costumes to the stunning soloists and corps de ballet who danced with great technique, artistry, and flair.
The prologue started off strong, with the ailing but chivalrous Don Quixote dreaming of adventure and damsels in distress among the books of his study. The performance was immediately captivating — the costumes and sets were utterly gorgeous, perfectly complementing the dynamic, expressive dancers on stage.
Craig captures the essence of the eponymous character amid his delusions of grandeur, at once embodying a silly old man and a dashing knight. Akiba’s animated performance as Sancho Panza was also superb as the focus of hilarious pantomimes and slapstick throughout the ballet. Ballet is an inherently performative art, and pantomiming is thus a crucial part of telling the story of the ballet. “Don Quixote” utterly succeeded in this aspect; the humor was sharp and witty, garnering lots of laughs from the audience throughout the ballet.
The opening scene of Act I was bursting with energy, with every dancer at the top of their game. “Don Quixote” is an incredibly difficult ballet, requiring its dancers to have impeccable technique, precision, stamina, and artistic flair, and the Boston Ballet dancers rose to the challenge. Munro’s performance as the preening nobleman Ganache was especially memorable, and his affected mannerisms and self-important airs perfectly captured the frivolity of his character.
However, the leads stole the show. Dunn’s energetic performance as Basilio exuded charisma and charm, and he demonstrated the breadth of his skill in the many challenging yet flawlessly executed jumps, turns, and partnering sequences performed by his character. His dramatic faked death in the third act was a delight to watch, and the audience was in an uproar as he leapt back to life.
Oga was radiant as Kitri; her energy and spunk were infectious, imbuing each scene with greater liveliness. A naturally petite dancer, Oga nonetheless captured all attention when she leapt on stage with her gravity-defying leaps, whip-fast turns, precise petit allegro, and expressive acting — with many well-placed moments of sass. Her execution of the famous Kitri solo at the end of Act I was utterly spectacular, exhibiting both her explosive energy and phenomenal control as she hit every single beat in the iconic turn sequence.
A soloist at the Boston Ballet, Chisako Oga has been featured in several prominent roles already. Fans of the Boston Ballet may recall her role as the elegant, sylphic Snow Queen in this past Nutcracker season, where she stood out among a sea of soloists. It was immensely satisfying to see such a deserving ballerina be given the opportunity to perform such a star role, and she absolutely blew it out of the water.
Thanks to the superb acting and artistic directing, the audience could clearly sense the romantic tension between Kitri and Basilio, witnessing the characters’ growth from amorous, fickle lovers to a mature young couple.
The second act was excellent as well, and the audience enjoyed more humor and pantomime with the troupe of travelers, although some of the acting scenes became slightly harder to follow as the story’s complexity grew.
Another phenomenal aspect of Act II were the special effects, especially in the dream scene when a ghostly specter of Dulcinea emerged to tempt Don Quixote into adventure. The glittering dryads also performed several lovely variations, including the Queen of the Dryad’s carefully controlled Italian fouettes (Viktorina Kapitonova).
The wedding scene in Act III in this production felt a tad too long. The ballet ran a full two hours and 48 minutes, including two 20 minute intermissions. Nonetheless, the dancers were still at the top of their game, demonstrating their remarkable stamina. However, the audience may not have that kind of endurance, and the ballet certainly could have benefited from trimming down the intermissions quite a bit.
Boston Ballet truly goes above and beyond in all aspects of the performance. The dancing was flawless and full of energy, the orchestra swelled at just the right moments, and the props and sets were vibrant and evocative of the whimsy of Don Quixote — such as an amusing two-person horse costume and the 30-foot tall mobile windmill. “Don Quixote” is not a show to be missed, and audiences will utterly enjoy this delight of a ballet.

Part of the North American Tour of “Hadestown,” the musical retelling of the Greek tragedy of Orpheus with music, lyrics, and book by Anaïs Mitchell, came to the Hanover Theater and Conservatory in Worcester, MA from March 28 to April 2. Featuring strong performances and creative choreography, the North American Tour is mostly successful in bringing the gorgeous musical to life.
The cast is an asset to the production. Chibueze Ihuoma in the leading role of Orpheus brought a palpable earnestness and naivety to the character, making his disillusionment over the course of the story even more heart-wrenching. His performance was particularly stunning during the desperate ballads “Wait for Me” and “If It’s True.” Ihuoma also had a subtle but touching chemistry with his love interest Eurydice (Hannah Whitley) as the two demonstrated a very clear and natural romance onstage even when they were not the focus of the scene. Whitley’s performance was convincing throughout, and played a delightfully gentle but abrasive iteration of Eurydice.
Nathan Lee Graham brought a sense of camp to the character of Hermes. Though his performance was entertaining and his vocal talent was clear, his choice to playfully overdramatize Hermes provided some tonal incoherence throughout the show. This negative effect was most egregious when Hermes gargled after Orpheus’s impassioned toast about hope for the future in spite of strife during “Livin’ It Up On Top.”
In fact, issues of comedic timing continued throughout the show. Several emotionally powerful moments were sacrificed for laughs. Eurydice’s and Orpheus’s reunion and Hades remembering the song of his love are particularly perplexing examples — ill-timed humor completely undercut their potential power. The end of Act One — where Eurydice went into Hades’s (Matthew Patrick Quinn) office to sign a contract — is similarly uncomfortable, as this production suggested a distinctly sexual dimension to Hades’s manipulation of Eurydice, but unfortunately was uninterested in investigating this exploitative dynamic further, as the moment was quickly forgotten in Act Two in favor of Persephone’s (Lana Gordon) admittedly brilliant rendition of “Our Lady of the Underground.”
Though some of these aspects could have benefitted from more workshopping, the staging of the show on a fairly small stage was impactful and creatively done. The band performed live onstage for the whole show, and their ad lib interactions with the cast brought a vibrant, genuine aspect to the world. Though there were some strange moments in the pair work between Eurydice and Orpheus, and Hades and Persephone, the alternate uses of camaraderie and stillness during Orpheus’s numbers and sharpness and sternness during Eurydice’s helped to visually establish the world and these characters’ opposing philosophies.
From beginning to end, the performance of the ensemble was excellent, both in creating the world of Hadestown and supporting the principal characters’ arcs. Ensemble members Jordan Bollwerk, Jamal Lee Harris, Courtney Lauster, Sean Watkinson, and Cecilia Trippiedi (in the March 28 performance) were entertaining and convincing in the large range of performances they give and support, and they were engaged for the entire time they were onstage — which was brilliantly demonstrated during “If It’s True.”
Though it may be an influence from “Hamilton,” the revolving stage was well used — and since there was no stage elevator, the platform mechanism used to bring actors above and below the stage, which was central to the Broadway production of “Hadestown,” the North American Tour adapted to include a large opening and closing door. The change was smooth, and it was effective at maintaining the dramatic atmosphere.
The work of lighting designer Bradley King was also effective, with different colors emphasizing different characters during the loud ensemble numbers, and seamless transitions between raucous vibrancy and candlelit “I Want” songs during the first act. The only uncomfortable moment was when the workers’ headlamps shone bright lights directly into the audience’s eyes during “Wait for Me,” but thankfully this passed quickly and was forgotten in the wake of the stunning transition into Hadestown as the stage enlarged, revealing a stylized view of pipes and lighting, creating the impression of a behind-the-scenes look at the underbelly of the stage.
There were some minor problems with costumes, designed by Michael Krass. The majority of them looked quite cheap, with thin fabrics and a lack of structure, but the colors were well-articulated to show the different characters’ worldviews. Ironically, the exploited workers’ brown leather overalls were the most convincing. Similarly, the strap for Orpheus’s guitar did not fit and so it frequently threatened to fall, though Ihuoma handled it professionally throughout.
Ultimately, despite some minor points that may have benefited from further ironing out, the North American Tour of “Hadestown” features great performances, creative staging, and production choices that add more texture to the already touching and cathartic musical.

Reviving the Past: The Attic Brings 70s Fashion Back to Harvard Square
In the unfortunate event that Claire Saffitz ’09 — renowned pastry chef, author, and YouTube personality behind “Dessert Person” — could only enjoy one food for the rest of her life, she would go back to the basics.
“Probably bread and butter,” Saffitz said in an interview with The Crimson. “Every time they have, like, good butter on homemade bread or something like that, I just am convinced it’s the best thing I’d ever eat. And I don’t think I would ever get tired of it.”
Since Saffitz’s time at Harvard, much has changed — Adams House, her former residence hall, is undergoing renovations, Café Pamplona has long since closed its doors, and STEM students find themselves walking over the bridge to Allston for course meetings. Perhaps surprisingly though, even more has stayed just the same.
From dinners with her sophomore seminar leader Tim at local restaurant Daedalus to various courses with English professor Glenda R. Carpio, Saffitz’s Harvard bears a remarkable resemblance to the one loved by current students.
“I had so many good memories of my time at Harvard and I loved, I loved, living in Cambridge. I just loved the kind of atmosphere and the amount of, a sort of like, cultural opportunities there,” Saffitz said.
“I regret that I actually didn’t take advantage of it more,” Saffitz finished. Despite her regrets, Saffitz is — in many respects — a Harvard success story. As a decorated pastry chef, author of two baking books (“Dessert Person” and “What’s for Dessert”), and well-known YouTube personality of Bon Appétit “Gourmet Makes” fame, Saffitz represents the joyful accomplishments that can come from pursuing the arguably unconventional path.
“I felt like at Harvard, at least at a time when I was a student, there were sort of set tracks and I didn't really fit into any of them,” Saffitz said.
When asked about her career prospects while in college, Saffitz said that she was interested in journalism, which presented some challenges: “I remember just not really feeling like I had a lot of support or like there was just sort of a kind of built in support system for people that wanted to pursue that like there was for people who wanted to go into finance or medicine or law.”
For students aspiring to medical school, graduate degree programs, or the stereotypical Harvard-to-New-York-consultant pipeline, there are often more extensively curated and visible career resources available. But for Saffitz, a Humanities concentrator whose only post-graduate North Star appeared to be the desire to do “something involving writing and literature,” the future was a bit blurrier.
Like many prospective graduates, “I didn’t really know what I wanted to be,” Saffitz said.
“There’s so many more career paths out there than is recognized by undergraduate students and that was a really important thing for me to realize,” she explained.
“I had been out of undergrad for a couple of years and I just remember thinking to myself, like, the only thing I really seem to have a sustained intense interest in is cooking and baking.”
“And I thought to myself, if I want to pursue this, I should probably explore it now.”
Going on to study at both École Grégoire-Ferrandi, a French culinary and trade school, and McGill University, where she earned a master’s degree in History, Saffitz discovered ways to combine her sustained interest in academics with food.
That being said, she acknowledges that turning one’s passion into their profession is not always sunshine and rainbows. The adage “Choose a job you love and you’ll never work a day in your life” was clearly not created in the 21st century.
“It’s not necessarily always a healthy thing to tell people that, like, you have to find happiness in your work or that has to be the source of your happiness,” Saffitz said.
“My first boss said something to me very, very true. She said, if it wasn’t work, they wouldn’t pay you.”
“There’s deadlines and there’s pressure, and not every part of it is creative — like not 100 percent of what I do is being in the kitchen, you know, creating a recipe — not even close.”
“There’s a lot more that goes into work that is undoubtedly work. But if that thing can be at the core of what you do, then I think that’s great.”
Looking back on her career, more than a decade after she was one of countless black caps lining the Yard for Harvard Commencement, Saffitz seems to have made the right choice.
“I find it very reassuring that, you know, after 10 years of having this be my career, I still love it just as much now as I did, you know, before I even sort of went to culinary school,” Saffitz said, “That passion has not diminished.”
In fact, it has transformed: While she describes herself as “a bit of a social media skeptic,” her YouTube channel and Patreon allow her to engage meaningfully with audiences everywhere. By merging recipe creation with digital media, Saffitz can visually demonstrate techniques which may be restrained by print publication.
“I think teaching is what I’ve become most passionate about. You know, as far as my work, so I love being able to teach and empower homemakers through videos,” Saffitz said.
For undergraduates feeling anxious or overwhelmed by the infinite number of choices post-graduate life offers — or for those getting lost in the weeds as another spring semester breezes by — Saffitz stresses the importance of slowing down.
“The best advice that I could give someone at this stage is probably the advice that I would give myself — which is to relax a little bit, you know? You don’t have to have it all figured out,” Saffitz said.
“It’s easy to look at someone else and think that they have it all figured out. But I think everyone’s pretty much at the same point, which is like, figuring it out as they go.”
From her experience, “A lot of it made sense only in hindsight.”
In weaving through culinary school, academia, and YouTube stardom, Saffitz said, she kept coming back to one question: “Am I happy doing this right now?”
“And if the answer was yes, then I would continue to do it.”

Fonda Lee, who made a name for herself as the author of the fantasy series “The Green Bone Saga,” released “Untethered Sky” on April 11, a novella that follows a hunter and her bird on a quest for revenge. Unfortunately, Lee fails to live up to her reputation in her newest work, as “Untethered Sky” falls short due to its lack of an interesting main character and proper world-building. This is a true disappointment, as the book’s great highlights are overshadowed by its shortcomings.
“Untethered Sky” is a fantasy adventure that follows the story of Ester, a young woman who dreams of becoming a ruhker — one of the elite hunters who track and kill the deadly, human-eating manticores that plague her kingdom. Despite the fact that ruhking is rarely done by women, Ester is determined to prove herself. Her motivation is fueled by the tragic loss of her mother and younger brother, who were killed by manticores when she was just a child. Ester is tasked with training Zhara, a fearsome and powerful young roc, to help her hunt the manticores. Along with her friends Darius and Nasmin, Ester is given the opportunity to join the most ambitious mission ever assigned to ruhkers: The Great Hunt.
Ester’s determination to become a ruhker is admirable, but her character feels somewhat one-dimensional. Her singular focus on becoming a ruhker leaves her personality underdeveloped and uninteresting. Although she demonstrates bravery and determination in hunting the manticore that killed her family, her character lacks the depth necessary to make her goal emotionally satisfying. Overall, “Untethered Sky” would have benefited from a more multifaceted portrayal of her personality — for example, a more extensive exploration of her strong connection with nature, which the book alludes to but never handles in depth.
Although Esther’s character was somewhat lacking, the character of Darius — one of Ester’s closest friends and her love interest throughout the novella — is more nuanced and interesting, despite the romantic plot being underdeveloped. Like Ester, Darius is consumed by his desire to become a successful ruhker, but what makes his character more lifelike is his evident love for his roc. Although Ester loves Zhara, Darius’s bond with his roc, Minu, is palpable throughout the pages, creating a touching connection between roc and human that was less present in the relationship between Ester and Zhara.
Although “Untethered Sky” offers some strong moments and characters, the overall plot is somewhat uninteresting. The story’s focus on the Great Hunt and Ester’s aspiration to become a ruhker, though providing a clear goal for the characters, makes the plot feel somewhat formulaic and predictable. The book’s occasional twists and turns are not enough to fully captivate the reader’s attention. Additionally, the world-building is lackluster, leaving many unanswered questions about Ester’s kingdom and its culture. While the concept of the ruhkers and their rocs is intriguing, the setting and political tensions are not well-explored. This could be due to the brevity of the novella, but the story would have benefited from a more complete understanding of its world and culture.
Despite its shortcomings, “Untethered Sky” includes several standout scenes, such as the brutal murder of Ester’s mother and brother at the beginning of the novella. This scene is expertly crafted, evoking intense emotions of grief, fear, and horror. Lee’s decision to include unsettling details adds to the situation’s visceral realism and heightens the impact of the tragedy and the horror a young Ester must have felt. This scene serves as a gripping introduction to the story and expertly establishes Ester’s motivation for becoming a ruhker. It is a testament to Lee’s skill that this scene remains vividly etched in the reader’s mind long after the book is finished.
“Untethered Sky” introduces some fascinating concepts and creatures, most notably the rocs at the center of the story, as well as some emotionally powerful scenes. However, the novella fails to do these concepts and scenes justice as its underwhelming main character and world-building ultimately drag the story down.

A drumbeat pounds as combat boots march quickly through the room to stand on the bottom two steps, one person on each. Soon, the shouts begin. The Roman commoners are hungry. They demand corn. And they find Caius Martius at fault.
“Coriolanus,” Shakespeare’s tragic tale of class struggle, war, and ego, runs from March 30 to April 23 at the BCA Plaza Theater. Director A. Nora Long’s vision is brought to life in the modern-verse adaptation crafted by Sean San José. This original adaptation of Shakespeare’s timeless classic proves that lessons from the past remain strikingly relevant today. Presented by the Actors’ Shakespeare Project in collaboration with Play On Shakspeare, this adaptation’s changes in language, casting, and stage direction successfully reimagine “Coriolanus” while staying true to the original plot.
Martius, despite being considered an enemy of the people, wins the title “Coriolanus” through a military victory at the town of Corioli. While he is encouraged to vie for the highest political office, he struggles to display the humility owed to the public. Ultimately, he marches on his own city, Rome, but is persuaded not to attack. Yet, in the end, he is killed.
“Coriolanus” is a male-dominated story. The key players, with the notable exception of Coriolanus’s wife and mother, are all men. Traditionally, even the female characters would have been played by men. Long’s adaptation turns this on its head; as the first scene begins, one choice is immediately obvious: the introduction of an entirely female cast. This is not the first time an adaptation of “Coriolanus” has had the male parts played by women. In this case, however, while it was inspiring to see women in roles they may not have traditionally been cast in, this adaptation failed to reimagine the content of the characters’ performance for a female actress. There is further potential for innovation and refurbishment of the original story through the use of female characters. While the first step of using female characters was taken, the further step of changing the characters as a result of that creative decision was not taken.
Right off the bat, the women stand on the steps, partially immersed in the audience. Clothed in army green cargo pants and black topics, the play erupts with the fervor of impassioned common people. Emily Woods Hogue’s minimalist costuming evokes the toughness of a military culture while allowing the focus to remain on the acting over the costumes.
Then, Coriolanus (Genevieve Simon) enters the stage. With a seething smile and boatloads of swagger, Coriolanus’s cockiness oozes across the theater. Shakespeare may not have imagined Gaius Martius wearing Doc Martens, but the effect is the same: a tough, seasoned warrior, with an added touch of sass. Simon’s fiery performance carried much of the emotional power of the play.
The show plays with the boundary between present and past — changing much of the language, but keeping the Roman setting. San José’s updated language keeps all of Shakespeare’s wit, while becoming more accessible to contemporary audiences. Similar to Shakespeare’s original poetic style, the cadence and rhyme carry viewers from one scene to the next. San José was successful in creating dialogue that entertained, amused, and moved audiences, while preserving the beloved aspects of Shakespeare’s original text.
The technical design plays a large role in successfully creating this striking performance. Throughout the production, the actresses navigate the performance space through no fewer than three exits and entrances. Further, audience members are kept on their toes by surprising creative technical choices. Lights go up, briefly reminding viewers of the reality they left behind when the show began, yet also pulling them into a time far away.
Foreboding drum sound effects, designed by Mackenzie Adamick, amplify the drumbeat of combat boots navigating the stage, like the sound of a distant army approaching. Aside from these sounds, sound effects were limited, allowing viewers to focus on the eruptive emotion portrayed by the dialogue. This high-intensity, emotional drama offers moments of poignant silence; the emptiness punctuating the power of speech.
Cristina Todesco, the scenic designer, paints an abstract, versatile landscape upon which the drama plays out. By the end of the show, the black box looks nearly the same as at the start. Audiences stare at abstract, partially torn Roman inspired paintings. The paintings seem inspired by the Romantic period; art reimagining another period, the same effort undertaken by the adaptation as a whole. The only discernible difference lies on the raised platform at the back of the theater. Where once five chairs previously lied tipped over with two standing, they now all stand upright.
This production successfully introduces a freshness to “Coriolanus,” leaving viewers thinking about issues of government and society relevant to the present moment. However, the production missed an opportunity to lean further into a female lens, thus leaving some of its potential for innovative performance untapped. Nonetheless, this production of “Coriolanus” is a moving reflection on universal themes of pride, humility, and the power of the common people.

How does a convent of nuns find itself intertwined with nightclubs and gangsters?
Directed by Leigh Barrett, the lively musical comedy “Sister Act” runs from April 7 through May 14 at The Lyric Stage Company of Boston. Although in a theater of only 244 seats, the show takes on the energy of the Broadway production with a talented cast and calculated set.
Inspired by the 1992 film of the same title, “Sister Act” follows Deloris Van Cartier (Yewande Odetoyinbo), a lounge singer who sees her partner commit a crime, takes on the guise of a nun for protection, and unexpectedly becomes the leader of an odd-sounding church choir. Odetoyinbo plays a perfect Deloris, emulating both the secular and religious versions of the character until both identities inevitably fuse into one. Her strong belt and confident air are infectious and believably portray her character’s empowering and transformative impact on the nuns.
Along with Odetoyinbo, the entire cast has impressively sharp comedic timing. Their character work is thorough, as everyone on stage is fully engaged in every part of every scene, making strong choices that result in a hilarious performance.
The quartet of the antagonist Curtis (Damon Singletary) and his goons (Jackson Jirard, Cristhian Mancinas-García, and James Turner) contribute significantly to the show’s comedic success. Their clumsy and uncoordinated behavior helps surprise the audience with unexpected, skillful moves during dance breaks. Their beautiful harmonies in songs like “Lady in the Long Black Dress,” and “When I Find My Baby” get the audience into a groove so infectious it makes one forget that their entire goal is to kill Deloris.
Deloris’s knight in shining armor, Eddie (Davron S. Monroe), is also an impressive singer, which is particularly astonishing during his solo “I Could Be That Guy,” featuring two on-stage quick changes that were done effortlessly.
The technical aspects of the show are meticulously planned for the perfect effects. The staging is done on a thrust stage, which could’ve made scene changes difficult, but instead helps make the show cohesive, as different scenes were set on different areas of the stage. The theater also made the show more intimate, as actors were able to enter and exit through aisles between the audience, fully immersing them into the show.
The production has a lot of high moments, but the biggest show stealers are the nuns. The quirky and hilarious ensemble makes the crowd holler with just a change of facial expressions and their purposefully bad singing. The production successfully makes every nun her own special treat. Their individuality is emphasized, which is hard to do considering they’re all wearing the same habit and don’t have individual spotlights. This choice adds to the excitement, as the abundance of ensuing nonsense creates a sense of hundreds of nuns on stage instead of a dozen, but it also emphasizes the themes of the show, revolving around the balance of discipline and fun.
The head nun, Mother Superior (Cheryl McMahon), has a gentle, soprano voice that strategically contrasts her greatest nuisance, Deloris’s strong, alto voice. Sister Mary Robert (Kira Troilo), another soprano powerhouse, is a nun who has to find her voice, and when she does, the ensemble numbers never sound the same again. Even Monsignor O’Hara, played by Todd Yard, has funny moments where he functions less as a priest in the church and more as a manager for his Catholic girl group.
The entire show is incredibly lively, with shimmery outfits and 1970’s sounding music, looking like a scene straight out of a disco. The finale just furthers this feeling, as it is joyous and celebratory, even bringing out the antagonists to sing and dance along with the rest of the cast. The set, music, and entire cast create an amusing and entertaining experience — the appropriate effect of a musical comedy. The Lyric Stage Company of Boston’s production of “Sister Act” has something for everyone and is a definite must-see.

On his new single “Ghost of Chicago,” Noah Floersch bounces both into his verses and into our hearts with a song fun enough to dance to, but poignant enough to leave listeners pondering its story over and over again.
“I was never looking for her till I found her now I find her everywhere” opens “Ghost of Chicago,” first teased on TikTok earning almost two million likes. In his unique intro, Floersch describes the feeling of falling into sudden obsession with a love interest, and in doing so gives the listener their first taste of a song unlikely to escape hums and whistles for weeks to come.
In a mainstream industry filled with over-processed vocals, Floersch stands out — the first verse feels like it could be sung to you in your kitchen. Yet this only improves the effect of his honestly gorgeous voice; as he slips in and out of falsetto on the chorus line “She’s the Ghost of Chicago,” Floersch doesn’t just sing the words, he captures their lament. While not performing any vocal backflips, Floersch achieves a simple sort of expressive beauty throughout the track.
Paired with this emotion-filled singing, Floersch’s refreshing lyrics only complement his voice. Whether its playing cleverly with rhymes, as with the lines “She's haunting me and honеstly / I'm honored to be haunted by thе likes of she,” or giving the listener a taste of a compelling story, like the chorus does with “She's the ghost of Chicago / She got lost somehow / She gets married tomorrow / Oh, and I'm going down,” Floersch manages to extract surprising amounts of ingenuity out of only a few words.
Long time musical partner and producer Ross Grieb also performs his role well, with the build-up instrumentation of the song matching Floersch’s vocal buildup, and the seamless integration of different instruments creating a satisfyingly unified sound. To a lone piano Grieb adds a hi-hat, guitar, bass, and a wonderful muted trumpet — which began as a TikTok duet with @aliii.catt and ended with Floersch inviting the original creator onto the song. In its music and in its theme, “Ghost of Chicago” grows continually, with every step adding a reason for the listener to move along with the groove.
Scrolling through Floersch’s TikTok feels a bit like discovering little fields of gold: A beautiful melody here, some hard-hitting lyrics there, but “Ghost of Chicago” manages to combine all his best aspects into one, neatly packaged piece of art that just leaves one question — when do we get more?

A title like “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” begs several questions. Who’s afraid? Why alligators? What makes this particular stage play “3D”? A Boston University New Play Initiative Production, written by Jay Eddy, directed by Shamus, and produced by Boston Playwrights’ Theatre and the Boston University College of Fine Arts School of Theatre, the self-described play with music “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” fearlessly grabs these questions by the scales and delivers an absurdly delightful exploration of loneliness, fear, and change.
The show focuses on a couple, Happy (Leah Kreitz) and Sweetness (Katherine Perry), and their move to the swamp for Sweetness’s job at a nature magazine. As the couple settle in, greeted by their friends (Zach Fontanez and Sam Plattus), the alligators, and other wildlife who p0pulate the swamp (Maurie Moore, Kendall Mcshane, Savannah Scott, and Ernesto Garrido Gonzonales), Happy begins to reckon with her feelings of isolation, desperation, and fear, which the happy-and-sweet couple learns to embrace together. Part absurd comedy, part chilling horror, the show expertly crafts a meaningful and entertaining confusion.
The play is filled from start to finish with poignant messages, frightening horror, and powerful punchlines. With only eight cast members, each actor must pull their dramatic and comedic weight, and each actor succeeded. While very archetypal characters can often feel static, these characters are quite three-dimensional — earning the “3D” title — and carry a depth to offset the frequently ridiculous exterior. Nonetheless, the balance of cartoonishness, meaning, and harrowing horror would benefit from reworking. Actors opted for a comic, unrealistic tone and style, which served its purpose for most of the show but at times fell flat.
Scenes are interspersed with thematic music that blends rockabilly, blues, zydeco, country, and funk. The actors also serve as musicians, and their instruments are strewn about the edges of the stage, adding an extra layer of energy to the performance. The music breaks up what could be an otherwise disjointed flow of events and emphasizes key elements of the narrative.
The final culmination of comedic-yet-scary, horror technical elements seemed incomplete. Dynamic red lighting, shadow puppetry, and musical sound effects created the perfect ambience — but they didn’t last long enough.
The interactive nature of “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” delivers on its promise of a “3D” production and makes the show a true gem. Beach balls and an inflatable alligator thrown into the audience bring the narrative straight to the theatergoers. At the same time, the concert-like atmosphere breaks down barriers between performers and audience members. During certain musical numbers, signs invite audience members to sing along, casting aside the austere aspects of absurdism and embracing the ability of audience and cast to create art together — making the show more fun for everyone.
Visually, “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” is stunning. Upon walking into the black box theater, patrons are immediately met with a vibrant, elaborate barrage of blues, greens, and yellows from set to props to costumes. Designed by scenic designer and props artisan Ami Okazaki, the set is an amalgamation of colorful doors and windows resembling a house. It only abstractly resembles what it means to convey, suitable for a play that does the same. Though the set is static, it is well-dressed with creative props and vibrant set pieces — including furniture represented by labeled moving boxes — which make the stage feel alive. The opening, closing, and sometimes barricaded doors allow for dynamic chase scenes and quirky interactions. Each detail in the scenic and prop design supports the cast in their zany interactions, and no bauble goes unused or unnoticed. All of the objects onstage are essential to the excitement and absurdity that make “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” thoroughly enjoyable.
The costumes, masterfully designed by Michael O’Herron, meld actors and set into one coherent concept. Glittery, frilly alligators visually contrast nasty, scary interiors. Cartoonish visors represent the other two alligators in key moments. In contrast with the colorful but regular clothes of Happy and Sweetness, the alligators stand out as outlandish and surreal. These lighthearted caricatures engender real fear, deepening the thrilling tension that drives the show as a whole.
The Boston University New Play Initiative’s Production of “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” is as shocking as it is meaningful. In the show, cartoonishness intentionally masks fear, speaking to a post-pandemic audience. Simultaneously a dream, nightmare, and blues concert, “Alligator-a-Phobia in 3D!” manages coherent disjointedness and delightful absurdity, making it worth the watch.

Freevee’s “Jury Duty,” the first four episodes of which aired on April 7, is a new documentary-style comedy reminiscent of “The Office.” It is deadpan, ironic, and wonderfully sarcastic, keeping the audience chuckling at the sheer absurdity of the events. The first half of the season indicates that the show will be strong and leaves viewers waiting for the next episodes.
The show’s concept is unique as it follows the jury process through the eyes of Ronald Gladden, who is both a contractor and the only person on set who is not an actor. Gladden is under the impression that they are filming a real documentary and everything happening around him is rooted in reality. In actuality, everyone around Gladden is acting. The show follows an entire trial process from jury selection to arguments and, eventually, the verdict.
One of the standout features of the show is the superb acting, which brings to life an eccentric cast of characters. From the cyber-crazed dork to the ultra-religious virgin, the actors embrace the absurdity of their roles with nuance and skill. Even James Marsden, who plays a parodied version of himself, delivers a performance that is both hilarious and endearing. Together, the characters create a vibrant and memorable world that keeps viewers engaged and entertained.
In particular, Cassandra Blair gives an excellent performance as she plays Vanessa Jenkins, one of the less erratic characters in the show who at first appears to blend into the background of the more eccentric characters. However, Blair’s excellent comedic timing provides a breath of fresh air among the crazier characters. She comes across as one the most entertaining jurors, despite having a smaller role.
The writing in the show is also a key factor in its success, as it deftly balances the absurdity of the concept with genuine moments of emotion and humor. With the hilarious antics of the jurors around Gladden, the show never fails to keep viewers engaged and entertained. The trial the writers created for the jurors to participate in is ridiculous without being unbelievable as the plaintiff, defendant, and their lawyers clash in the courtroom while both utterly failing to present a sound argument. Although the basics of the trial and concepts are scripted, the show also heavily relies on actor improvisation.
A review of the show wouldn’t be complete without discussing Ronald Gladden. As just an ordinary guy trying to make a little extra cash, Gladden clearly had no idea what he is for with the pure chaos that would ensue. However, even as a nonactor, Gladden manages to be thoroughly entertaining. His truly genuine reactions just make the absurdity even funnier as he tries to make sense of the insanity around him, such as the chair pants invented by fellow juror Todd.
What comes across clearly is that Gladden is just naturally charismatic. He has a carefree and outgoing personality as he tries to make friends with his fellow jurors and unite the group. He embarks on several side quests trying to serve as foreperson and help his jurors navigate their personal relationships.
"Jury Duty" is a clever and entertaining show that delivers laughs while also keeping viewers engaged with its unique concept and well-executed performances. It's refreshing to see a show that doesn't take itself too seriously while still managing to deliver genuine moments of humor. With its excellent writing and talented cast, "Jury Duty" is definitely a show worth watching. Whether the viewer is a fan of mockumentaries or just in the mood for a good laugh, this show is sure to deliver.

Based on a 70-page segment from Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” the musical “Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812” follows ingénue Countess Natasha Rostova’s arrival in Moscow, where she meets the rogue Anatole. Meanwhile, Pierre, a sensitive and existential man, searches for higher meaning. The recent Harvard production of “Great Comet,” directed by Samuel F. Dvorak ’23, aimed to create a unique and emotional experience for both the artists and the audiences.
“I think it's a beautiful story about characters finding the meaning of life — finding community and fellowship and each other,” Olympia M. A. Hatzilambrou ’24 said, who plays the titular role of Natasha.
With a moving and relentless score, this “electro-pop opera” promises to be unlike anything most audiences have ever seen — with the orchestra uniquely positioned onstage among the actors — providing an immersive experience.
The show is emotional and resonant, following the entangled lives of Russian nobility in the midst of the French Invasion of Russia.
“It shows that even though the world is a very dark and scary place, you can find beauty and meaning and the small moments of human connection,” Dvorak said.
With a cast of seventeen actors and a production team of over seventy people, “Great Comet” promises to be one of the biggest musical events of the semester, if not also the most technically demanding.
“I mean, it's by far the most challenging and demanding piece of theater that I've done here in my four years here. I'm about to graduate. I'm moved by and compelled by it,” Dvorak said.
Connor C. Riordan ’23, who joins the cast of “Great Comet” as Anatole, called the music “incredibly difficult to learn” and described the complex choreography by Kim as another technical challenge.
“This show requires more emotional range from me than I think I’ve ever had to use on stage,” Hatzilambrou said.
Her soaring solos call upon her classical opera training while remaining in the musical theater register. She remarked that it is “cool to experience new techniques.”
“I am just overwhelmed with joy seeing so many beautiful scenes happening and choreography and beautiful music happening on stage,” publicity producer Texaco Texeira-Ramos ’26 said.
“This is the best student show that I have ever been a part of at Harvard,” Riordan said, who has been participating in theater at Harvard since his freshman year. “I truly believe that it is one of the best artistic experiences that anybody will have on campus during their time here.”
The word “opera” may spark trepidation in the average audience member, but “Great Comet” is truly a unique production that viewers of all kinds will find meaningful.
“It really is a show that I think is so human and real, and no matter what your background in literature or theater is, or if you're interested in literature and theater, I think you will be entertained by the show and by the work that the students put in,” concluded Dvorak.
“It's been an honor to be in this cast. And it's an honor for you to come see it and we hope you will come,” Hatzilambrou said.
An ambitious undertaking and an unusual concept, “Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812” might not be the theater-goer’s usual fare, but the uniqueness of the show and the passion of its cast and crew make it worth a watch.

In 2016, then-CEO of Panera Bread, Ron Shaich (HBS MBA ’78), bought a majority stake in Tatte Bakery & Cafe.
Then priced at 7.5 billion, Panera is a multinational conglomerate company. Shaich justified the purchase as an endeavor to “upset the applecart of our apathetic dining habits by providing high-quality, soul-satisfying alternatives to fast food, in settings that feel more like Parisian patisseries than elementary school cafeterias,” according Boston Magazine's interview with the former CEO. The acquisition naturally brought up questions about Shaich’s vision for Tatte and similar restaurants in his portfolio.
Did Shaich aim to grow Tatte into a multinational corporation like Panera with millions of brick and mortar stores, potentially compromising its artisanal, local touch? Or did he instead intend to support local growth so that Tatte can better serve its communities without the forced tradeoffs that accompany rapid growth on a national scale?
After Shaich sold Panera to German conglomerate JAB for 7.5 billion in 2017, he turned his focus towards building his wellness-focused investment firm. According to Shaich, buying and purchasing Panera Bread was “Act II” of his investing plan. Starting in 2017, Shaich turned his focus to supporting wellness-inspired restaurants with his $300 million investment fund, Act III Holdings. Through Act III, Shaich bought Panera’s interest in Tatte Bakery & Cafe, as well as Cava Group, Zoë’s Kitchen, and experimental vegetarian seasonal food chain, Clover Food Labs.
With his new investments, Shaich seems deeply concerned with prioritizing customers and their restaurant experience. His past executive experience indicates his desire to scale these new ventures. It should feel “like a spa for your insides,” said Shaich in the same interview with Boston Magazine.
In other words, Shaich is interested in the cultivation of restaurant ethos — high-scale dining experiences that simultaneously provide a wholesome, artisanal experience of individualized, healthy living while at the same time scaling to regional, national, and multinational levels.
Tatte was founded in 2007 by Tzurit Or, an Israeli former producer who left a 12-year film career to start life in the US. Her main focus, according to the Tatte website, is to “grow the brand while protecting the smallest of details, maintain the highest standards, and hold fast to our shared mission: To Inspire, Care for, and Nurture life. Every Day.” Since 2007, Tatte has grown to span 12 locations in Boston and 10 locations in Washington, D.C.
Or’s resistance to trends and emphasis on restaurant culture seems to be a pivotal part of Tatte’s mission and Shaich’s own vision. In this sense, Tatte’s growth aligns with Shaich’s vision for growing his ventures: “You figure out what’s going to be sustaining and why. None of that is fad-oriented or focused on what happens to be hot this week,” he told Boston Magazine.
In this way, Shaich’s support of Tatte as part of his investment thesis stands at direct odds with activist investing — a phenomenon in publicly traded companies. An activist investor is typically a specialized hedge fund that, according to Investopedia, “buys a significant minority stake in a publicly traded company in order to change how it is run.” This investor’s goals “may be as modest as advising the company management or as ambitious as forcing the sale of the company, divestitures or restructuring, or replacing the board of directors.”
Shaich publicly opposes activist investing, instead staying laser focused on the long run. Indeed, according to The Street, his slide deck title for The Deal's annual corporate governance conference in 2018 responds directly to the modern climate of activist investors: “Building Companies of Value in a Short Term World.” Today, four years after the founding of Act III, navigating a lawsuit, and a pandemic, Shaich seems to be sticking to his investment thesis: Tatte continues to hire experienced, passionate individuals who stay true to Tatte’s artisanal vision in its growth, including Lyh-Rhen Lam, the Vice President of Concept, Creative, Brand Services, whose interest in food and design led him to work with several local businesses before joining Tatte. On the other end of the scale, many of Tatte’s executives have experience at multinational food and beverage corporations and global management consulting firms, and they bring their scale and expertise to building Tatte’s sustainable, authentic brand.
A prevalent trend, activist investing and corporate restructuring for the sake of growing fast and for profit dangerously renders investors like Shaich few and far in between. However, in his purchase of Tatte as well as Clover, Life Alive, and beyond, Shaich seems to be staying true to the mission of scaling with integrity. The firms still harbor nutritional and creative control of their menus, with input from Shaich himself, who describes his body as a “temple.” In his daily life, he tries to “eat well” and is very conscious of his diet.
As an example of this value-aligned investing, Shaich’s own vegan chef for seven years is now the current director of Life Alive. Shaich’s strategy serves as a model for scaling with integrity, preserving the values that business owners like Tzurit Or built and launched Tatte with in the first place.
Today, stepping into Tatte in Harvard Square feels different from entering a fast-food chain, even in bakery form. Amidst the atmosphere of modern, upscale wood-infused architecture, students and tourists alike converse candidly in line. Tatte, with its glass cases of freshly baked pastries and desserts, and its delicious house lattes carefully “poured with heart,” seems cozy and artisanal — a familiar family chain relative to the Starbucks down the street, whose sterile seating layout and impersonal printed menus contrast the warm, handwritten-chalk menu, worn-leather couch, and conversational aesthetic of Tatte’s interior.
So the next time you hear “Panera owns Tatte” or negative generalizing statements about acquisitions of smaller, local firms by larger ones, consider possibilities outside of activist investing. Tatte is an important case study in understanding investing relations as non-intrusive, intentional, and value-forward projects — processes where big is not necessarily better, and local firms are able to maintain and preserve their brand identities and individuality after the acquisition, and in this case, serving the Boston community to the best of their ability.

Sometimes, there is no greater pleasure than a goofy anthology of comedic writing. Luckily, “Being the Boss, and Other Short Plays” written and directed by Turandot Shayegan ’25, provided just that. Created as an extension of pandemic shenanigans, the set of three comedic, stand-alone, one-act plays ran from March 30 to April 1 at the Adams Pool Theater. While many creatives struggle to translate their quarantine fever dreams into reality, Shayegan’s production embraces the absurdity fostered by quarantine, allowing its very incoherence to be the throughline connecting one play to the next.
A chair, a table, and a lounge chair sat center stage as guests filled in with bubbly commotion. However, it was not until a dimming of the lights and a trumpet blare that the first act, “Troubles in Therapy,” began. In this jaunty take on the traditional headache of couples therapy, Olivia F. Data ’26 portrayed Sally Clark, an eccentric 61-year-old woman who is resolved to swindle her husband Jim Clark (Austin D. Kaufman ’25) to become the queen of Narnia — an opportunity she discovered thanks to her spam folder. Doc Garner, an exhausted therapist played by Kian Attari ’23, wants nothing but to get the two stooges out of his office. The two following plays stay consistent with Shayegan’s slapstick pattern; in “Prompting a Play,” Jack T. Flynn ’26 portrayed an encouraging director who installs a walkie-talkie system to prevent his actors from messing up their lines, but the prompter (Attari) mixes up the roles of police officer and suspect. Finally, the production ends with “Being the Boss,” a story of how a seemingly ludicrous businesswoman Celeste Rushmore (Data) gets her way despite the anxiety of her assistant John Winterburn (Flynn). Against his wishes, she emerges victorious from a negotiation with Louisa Durgle (Joy R. Ho ’26) equipped with nothing but long consonant sounds, alliterative puns, and copious fish analogies.
Throughout “Being the Boss, and Other Short Plays,” Shayegan’s absurdist writing lives in the comfortable intersection of weird and wacky. Her dialogue is colorful, her characters are loveable, and her analogies are downright unforgettable. While there is much to be enjoyed in this bite-sized production, the comedic resolutions of particular scenarios are often predictable — the couples therapy episode produces the anticipated bickering and the officer-criminal role reversal was not entirely unexpected. Yet, there is nonetheless a lively charm that accompanies the viewing experience; Shayegan’s writing and directing possess a bright quality that lets a reluctant whimsy in even as we’re guffawing loudly at the onstage clamor.
Perhaps no one better embodied the dichotomy between the strange and the silly than Data; her portrayals of wonky soon-to-be divorcée and eccentric diva were positively enrapturing. From her animated voice work to over-the-top physical comedy, Data’s full acting arsenal was on display. She owned each of her characters, turning the lunatic fantasies of each into her own. Similarly, Kaufman fully embraced his roles, deftly adapting his voice work between roles. Ho matched his ferocity with equal skill; the chemistry of their physical comedy on-stage during “Prompting a Play” was a recipe for laughter.
Flynn masterfully showed his range within his less prominent roles, highlighting his penchant for comedic timing. At once earnest and optimistic in “Prompting a Play,” he became effortlessly exasperated in “Being the Boss.” Meanwhile, Attari’s performance perfectly complemented the onstage bickering in the first two acts, adding fuel to the mounting ridiculousness onstage. Both actors expertly stoked the fire ignited by other characters.
The choice to hold the production in the Adams Pool Theatre was remarkably fitting; the small stage was the right size to be fully commanded by the actors without seeming crowded, and the flanking mirrors prevented the performance from feeling claustrophobic. The tech crew, Haley M. Stark ’25, David C. Brown ’25, and Maranatha Paul ’26 chose lighting that bordered on the conservative, favoring minimal illumination so the audience’s eyes could roam between characters instead of fixating on only one. Music composed by Emil R. Massad ’25 found its bravado in its simplicity and en pointe comedic timing; melodic choices complemented the onstage banter appropriately without overpowering the actors.
Overall, “Being the Boss, and Other Short Plays” was a pleasant watch that found its joy in the wacky. Shayegan managed to accomplish a feat few can boast: She brought her quarantine musings into real life — and real laughs.

Director Jamie Lloyd's minimalistic production of “A Doll’s House” opened at Broadway’s Hudson Theatre on March 9th. Originally written in Norwegian by Henrik Ibsen, the play features an inherently female-driven narrative — but this production, an English translation by American playwright Amy Herzog, is the play’s first adaptation by a woman. Herzog condenses “A Doll’s House” into a 105-minute intermission-less tour de force that centers its main protagonist Nora Helmer, played by Academy Award-winning actress Jessica Chastain, in a way that is almost reminiscent of a one-woman show.
A doll in a music box, Chastain slowly spins round and round. The actress is motionless as she sits on a dark turntable in the middle of the New York City stage, while audience members are slowly trickling in. One by one, Chastain is joined by her fellow cast members. The set is bare and the grim ambiance palpable. This show does not rely on stereotypical Broadway glamor. Stripped away from any possible distractions, Tony-nominated Lloyd and Obie-winning playwright Amy Herzog self-reportedly set out to break down the play to its most quintessential questions of human agency, gender bias, and the contrast of love and deception.
The production centers on Nora Helmer as the audience views the world through Nora’s eyes and witnesses her relationship and friendships exclusively from her perspective. While Nora is traditionally seen as a noble victim of male manipulation rather than an active participant in her own tragedy, in this production, Herzog highlights the ways the protagonist plays an active part in building her surrounding world which ultimately traps her, commemorating both social dynamics and gender stereotypes. Oddly, it is empowering that Nora’s life is not merely happening to her; she is neither naive nor oblivious to her surroundings or circumstances. Nora is not a victim, she is a human being.
Lloyd demands a lot of his actors — and yet so little. The production features no props, barely any costumes, and limited movement. When the actors discussed the act of smoking a cigar, the mere dialogue sufficed. The same holds for the famous last scene in which Nora and Torvald return their wedding rings. It was satisfying that the lack of props was not curtailed with exuberant gestures but instead shifted the audience’s attention away from the physical objects to deeper meaning. At first the absence of props caused slight confusion, but eventually it succeeded in highlighting the importance of the spoken word. Due to Lloyd’s generally spectacular directing, the few less than ideal directorial choices stuck out. Especially striking was the staging of Nora’s dance, which Chastain performed while sitting on a chair. Chastain’s serious demeanor paired with her committed delivery kept the scene from becoming a comedic bit — nevertheless, the reasoning behind this odd directorial choice is unclear. Whatever Lloyd wanted to achieve did not work.
Apart from little mishaps, Lloyd’s direction remains crystal clear and powerful, successfully putting a new spin on an old theater classic. The casting perfectly underlines the production needs. Chastain, despite being a Juilliard graduate, is primarily known for her on-screen work. Her delivery shines in its subtlety and honesty, perfectly complementing the minimalist setup of the show. Chastain’s performance is the backbone of the show. Shows rarely rely so heavily on the talent of its main actor and thankfully, Chastain delivers a masterclass in acting and endurance. Taking on an iconic role is no easy feat, but Chastain masters the challenge; her nuanced portrayal of Nora showcases a fundamental understanding of the character which will enrich and inspire how theatermakers and audiences understand and perceive Nora Helmer in the future.
Arian Moayed’s portrayal of Torvald Helmer perfectly embraces his close-mindedness as well as his controlling and manipulative personality. Moayed delivers the pivotal scene in which Torvald discovers his wife’s lies powerfully, perfectly tracing the arc from anger to fear and belated compassion without relying on aggressive violence or screams. When he cursed at his wife, saying “you bitch,” the delivery carried a shocking sense of disgust and hatred. The rest of the cast complements both Chastain’s and Moayed’s performances beautifully; especially striking is Michael Patrick Thornton’s heartfelt portrayal of Dr. Rank. Even when faced with death, Thornton’s Dr. Rank never quite loses his love and compassion, making his scenes with Chastain one of the highlights of the show.
“A Doll’s House” is a well-rounded standout rendition of a theater classic that particularly shines in its stellar casting. The show is undoubtedly one of the best plays on Broadway right now. The must-see production runs through June 10 at the Hudson Theatre in New York City.

“In my experience, ambitious people fall quickly. But not you. You have a talent for survival.”
This is how the eponymous heroine of Costanza Casati’s debut novel “Clytemnestra” is described by one of her enemies. Casati’s novel retells the story of Helen of Troy’s twin sister, Clytemnestra — a strong warrior, mother, and queen with a knack for survival. The novel follows her as she navigates the male-dominated world of Ancient Greece, clinging onto her autonomy despite a life of tragedy. Although the book sometimes struggles under the weight of its multiple storylines, “Clytemnestra” still tells a compelling and unique story about one of Greek mythology’s most notorious female figures.
The novel’s strength lies in its ability to weave many complex stories into one linear narrative by centering all of these episodes on Clytemnestra herself. Clytemnestra is often portrayed as a side character or villain in Greek mythology, but in this novel she takes the center stage. Classic Greek heroes such as Theseus, Odysseus, Jason, and Achilles thereby become supporting characters in Clytemnestra’s compelling storyline rather than dominating the narrative. While literature and art has typically depicted male Greek heroes as courageous or exemplary, “Clytemnestra” instead highlights their horrible deeds and sexist beliefs. As Clytemnestra quips about Theseus, “Heroes like him are made of greed and cruelty: they take and take until the world around them is stripped of its beauty.” The novel shows how the heroes of some stories are the villains of others — and vice versa.
Casati’s careful consideration of different perspectives allows the reader to sympathize deeply with Clytemnestra. In Greek mythology, Clytemnestra is often remembered for being insane — a wretched woman who, blinded by a need for vengeance, murders her husband. But in Casati’s novel, she is a fiery figure, still fueled by a burning desire for revenge, but never painted as delusional. “Clytemnestra” shows how she is shaped by trauma yet still bravely holds onto power in a time when women were seen as subhuman. Casati’s clear feminist stance makes this retelling fresh despite being based on stories that are thousands of years old.
Casati, who was a scholar of Ancient Greek literature for over five years, balances informative descriptions of the Ancient Greek world with an entertaining and accessible style. Her research is obvious in every page of the novel, and the setting, characters, dialogue, and mythology are all incredibly detailed and historically accurate. Yet the novel never becomes too complicated in its descriptions of the past; the prose is lyrical in its simplicity.
While “Clytemnestra” is well-researched with an interesting premise, sometimes its multiple plotlines can be difficult to follow. There are large time jumps — ranging from a few months to fifteen years — between sections of Clytemnestra’s story. Not much character development occurs off the page, making it feel as if the characters simply aged for the sake of the plot. Various side characters who move in and out of the story hint at enticing plotlines — but instead of adding to the world of the story, these aspects distract the reader from the central plot. The novel’s time jumps and side characters, while faithful to the original Greek myths, ultimately make the story feel clunky.
Overall, “Clytemnestra” is unique due to its fresh, well-researched story with an intriguing heroine. The concept of revisiting a Greek myth with a feminist twist is not necessarily unique, but “Clytemnestra” still manages to break new ground by investigating the motives of a woman who has historically been marked as a villain. The novel is perfect for those interested in learning more about a misunderstood figure in Greek mythology, and Casati will be an author to watch in the years to come.

Complex, enigmatic, but undeniably compelling in its ephemeral images and bold creative choices, Dong Li’s poetry collection “The Orange Tree” showcases the expansiveness of the lyric voice and its capacity to cross borders, generations, and cultures. Dong Li, a recipient of the inaugural Phoenix Emerging Poet Book Prize for 2023, is unafraid to probe the recesses of familial sacrifice, national trauma, and cultural belonging to create a collection rife with images of immense suffering and extraordinary beauty.
The collection’s close attention to visual detail stands out immediately. Li presents images through lush descriptions that create intricate patterns of association. He transforms ordinary objects into multifaceted conduits that thread together narratives across generations and gather emotional momentum as the poems progress. In the poem “The Orange Tree,” the titular tree in “Grandfather’s house” becomes a symbol of generational movement as “each generation planted their own orange tree.” Li takes this central image of the orange tree in creative and unexpected directions, slowly turning it into a symbol of remembrance as the poem progresses to the present day. Through Li’s evocative writing, a simple item becomes charged with memory and emotional weight.
These patterns of association become even more complex as they broaden beyond personal histories, expanding to accommodate both national and cultural memories. In the poem “The Orange Tree,” the simple image of oranges falling ominously parallels the rhythmic footsteps of marching invaders during the Nanjing Massacre as “the Oranges fell at night, one after another, soft on the ground./ The Japanese Army invaded the old capital.”
Moving deftly through historical events — from the Cultural Revolution where the speaker’s mother “survived famine on orange peels” to the Tiananmen Square Massacre with the “orange-red faces of the young guards” — this intricate braiding of visual and lyrical associations unifies these major events in a narrative that feels fluid while still remaining cohesive.
It is in these representations of trauma that the delicacy and complexity of Li’s lyrical voice shines through. In the poem “Live, By Lightning,” the discomfitingly surgical image of “bayonets drawn in and out” is amplified by the imperative “listen” and the transition to the second-person “they would find you” later in the poem. The perspective switches constantly from the third-person — “he would never stand up again” — to the impersonal — “a strange / face flies through fine silhouette.” Rather than being confusing, these numerous points of view make the events more immersive, as the reader is simultaneously internal and external to the narrative. It is through this middle ground that everything feels more strangely lush; the suffering feels engrossing and inescapable.
The poetry’s lyrical quality reaches its peak in the juxtapositions between natural imagery and human activity in “The Army Dreamer”:
“the crossing never again
day slides against the anguish of night
time shredding the mind
fog and rain in the mountains
army dreamer on a white horse
a sleeve of twilight pierced the waters”
Numerous contrasts illuminate the images which shift back and forth — from the macroscopic “night” to the microscopic “mind,” the dark “night” and the luminous “white horse,” or even the blur of “fog and rain” in opposition to the sharp clarity of “twilight pieced the waters.” These rich images are more atmospheric than semantic, creating a reading experience that activates the imagination. Li’s poetry resists any straightforward interpretation. Instead, it encourages the reader to explore its numerous possibilities and the emotive force that drives its images. The poetry moves beyond a recounting of history and charges its scenes with an ethereal quality, giving Li’s words a transcendental effect.
These vivid images are reinforced by the collection’s inventive typography and visual features. The poems are marked with traditional Chinese calligraphy placed alongside English words, prompting readers to consider the English words in the same pictorial context, especially if they cannot read Chinese themselves. This use of Chinese calligraphy is also complemented by Li’s inclusion of empty space. Some pages feature single lines, while on other pages, the words are scattered across the page in a manner symbolic of the mood the words invoke. For example, in “Live, By Lightning”, the stanza “Time sinks in the river / he could be dead / was he already memory” is placed at the bottom of a page that is empty for all but one other line, viscerally recreating an image of sinking.
Because of its lyrical intensity and free-flowing associations, the poems can at times feel enigmatic and esoteric. However, Li’s use of patterns and carefully arranged typography ensures that readers never feel lost amidst the stunning images of this haunting collection.

Spanish Ran, a Bronx native and multi-talented hip-hop producer, has become a staple in the underground scene with his ear for up-and-coming talent and distinctive, throwback production style. In a recent in-depth interview with The Harvard Crimson, he opened up about his journey, influences, and passion for music, as well as his experiences working as an A&R in the music industry and the challenges he has faced along the way.
Before fully immersing himself in music production, Spanish Ran worked as an intern at Def Jam with famed hip-hop photographer and executive Lenny Santiago.
“I started interning at Def Jam and then when Lenny S. left Def Jam, he was like, 'I'm going to Roc Nation, you can stay here or you can just come with me and you can be my right hand,'” Spanish Ran said. “I got my first opportunity by signing Rapsody.”
After signing Rapsody, Ran helped expedite the signing of Chicago rapper Vic Mensa. He also championed the Buffalo-based Griselda Records as a collective of up-and-coming talents to watch. The producer recalled first discovering Griselda rappers Westside Gunn and Conway the Machine and playing their track — “The Cow” — for Jay-Z in the Roc Nation office.
“I was playing ‘The Cow,’ crazy, blasting loud like, 'Listen to this Conway verse,'” Ran said. “Jay would walk by back and forth just looking around like, 'Who the fuck is that?'”
Spanish Ran's full time transition into production was driven by his experience with the record label system and a desire to participate in the conversation as an artist.
“It was based on frustration really,” Ran said. “I'm already in it. And I'm seeing and I'm hearing it. I'm like, ‘You know what, let me take a step back and really just focus on myself and bring something to the table myself.’"
This shift marked the beginning of his journey as a full-time producer, allowing him to focus on his craft and developing his unique sound.
Born and raised in the Bronx, Spanish Ran's early influences included legends like Wu-Tang Clan, Dr. Dre, and DJ Premier. As he grew older, his appreciation evolved to include artists like J Dilla, Madlib, and The Alchemist. According to Ran, The Alchemist in particular inspires him to remain relevant by consistently adapting to new sounds and working with younger artists.
"He got better in time,” Spanish Ran said. “Like he's always been good. But as his peers are starting to drift away, he evolved way more."
Ran’s first project, "Spanish Sauce," released with Sauce Heist in 2019, was a significant milestone in his career. Released on vinyl, it was a moment that humbled the producer as he recalled the project's creation in his home.
“We did this in the crib, in the house, like just a room and a mic and our focus,” the producer said. “No big studio, no nothing, I just know how shit's supposed to sound now and I did what I had to do with it.”
Seeing his work on vinyl and watching people from around the world spin his records was an awe-inspiring moment for the producer.
“Seeing people spinning it, or playing it, or reposting it from Switzerland to Sweden, and all these places that's not the Bronx, we can take this to the world now,” Ran said. “Music has always been universal, but when you do it in a room in the Bronx, and then you see the same work that you did getting played in a country that you haven't been to yet? It's humbling.”
The producer emphasizes the importance of consistency and dedication to his craft.
"I pretty much make beats every day like brushing my teeth," he said. His daily routine involves working in the morning, hitting the gym, and seeking inspiration from the latest releases, as well as staying connected to the music community through social media and word of mouth.
In the future, Spanish Ran plans to expand his reach within the East Coast underground while staying true to his roots. He's excited about his upcoming release with rapper Tree Mason, set to drop on April 20.
“I'm also working on two other albums by a guy by the name of WateRR from Chicago and another album with Al-Doe in July,” Ran said. “Those three are all different, but the work on it is crazy. I can't wait for people to really listen to it.”
As his career progresses, Spanish Ran aims to be a leading figure in the hip-hop community, both as a producer and as a mentor for up-and-coming artists. His passion for music and the culture is evident in the way he speaks about his work and his aspirations.
"I’m gonna make sure that I'm gonna be the best at it,” he said. “Because I'm not gonna just do this half-assed, I'm gonna make sure I’m gonna be one of the best."

Nowadays, it seems like nearly everything in TV and film is being remade. In the past few years we’ve seen remakes of classic movies like Little Women (2019), A Man Called Otto (2022), and Emma (2020), or TV reboots of shows like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Saved by the Bell, and Gossip Girl. Now, Harry Potter — a beloved staple of popular culture — is next.
If Harry Potter is already a cult classic, why is HBO trying to remake it?
While a Harry Potter TV series has been in the works with HBO Max (where the Harry Potter 20th anniversary reunion special aired last January) for a few years, it has only now been officially confirmed, and set to stream on their new streaming platform Max in a series of releases over a ten-year period.
Remakes often swing two ways with audiences: Either they improve on and bring a fresh wave of appreciation to the original piece, or they fail to achieve the classic just-right feeling that the original piece garnered in its time.
Because of Harry Potter’s undeniable and beloved place in the fabric of modern popular culture, a TV remake runs the risk of feeling like a desperate attempt to maintain the relevance of Harry Potter universe, riding on the wave of the success of the “Fantastic Beasts” movie series and the Broadway play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.”
However, given the success of these extensions of the Harry Potter franchise, it doesn’t seem likely that the TV series remake will be a flop. According to Bloomberg, the TV series will be organized such that each book takes up a whole season, which means at least seven seasons of the show are set in stone.
JK Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books, will be involved in the series as an executive producer to maintain the accuracy of the TV show compared to the original series.
It looks as if this remake is set to please and perhaps make up for any — although likely sparing — letdowns the Harry Potter movies made amongst fans in the past.
In the past, TV show remakes of books that have been already made into movies have generally garnered positive reviews. The Netflix show “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” which came out in 2017, achieved the success that the movie of the same name did not. Author Daniel Handler was involved in the making of the show, which was not the case for the movie, and this created a noticeable difference. Many viewers felt that the show captured the essence of the book perfectly, with lines in the show taken almost directly from the books.
In 2024, Disney+ will be releasing a TV series of “Percy Jackon and the Olympians” which preemptively appears to be more faithful to the original series than the movies were. The TV series has cast age-appropriate characters and will be executively produced by the author himself, Rick Riordan, who had limited engagement with the movies and has famously shared his disdain for the 2010 movie adaptation since their release.
It is possible that the Harry Potter remake will see a similar form of praise that “A Series of Unfortunate Events” received and Percy Jackson appears set to receive.
Unlike Riordan and Handler’s somewhat estranged involvement with their series’ remakes, this TV adaptation of the Harry Potter series doesn’t seem to be JK Rowling’s version of the remake, because the author was involved in the initial movie-making process as well. Therefore, the TV show isn’t necessarily being made to redeem the movies, which are considered excellent adaptations in their own right.
However, the author has mentioned that she is committed to adding a new level of detail to the visual adaptation of the stories that the movies did not provide. Maybe Harry Potter fans will be able to see more depth or screen time given to their favorite side characters from the books, like Ginny Weasley or Peeves.
Fans of Harry Potter will definitely have to reckon with the unfamiliarity of the new faces that are likely to play these beloved characters. Given the fact that the later books in the series were released in tandem with Harry Potter movies, it’s likely that their overlap helped make the portrayals in movies feel so accurate to the characters in the books.
Just as past remakes have polarized fandoms, fans will probably have a love-hate relationship with the Harry Potter remake as well. Nonetheless, an HBO Harry Potter remake might be just what the Potterheads want and need as it continues to bring the stories to life and spread the love of the series to those who have not encountered Harry Potter yet — and if not, maybe it’s the perfect excuse to cancel your HBO subscription.

This review contains spoilers. 
At the Brattle Theater in Cambridge on April 6, Wicked Queer Film Festival spotlighted Aino Suni’s “Heartbeast,” an intense story of infatuation turned obsession between flawed young artists.
“Heartbeast,” a mostly French-language film, follows Elina (Elsi Sloan), an aspiring rapper who has to move from Finland to France so her mother can move in with her new boyfriend. Elina quickly becomes obsessively enamored with her mother’s boyfriend’s daughter, Sofia (Carmen Kassovitz), a privileged dancer struggling to keep up with the high expectations of everyone around her.
Suni’s direction makes “Heartbeast” a must-watch. The film’s highly saturated, vibrant color palette aptly portrays the high running emotions and tensions of the main characters. For example, the stunning blue sky during a fraught outdoor family lunch features mostly static camera work as the characters ignore, insult, and misunderstand one another. This makes the film’s few scenes with dark, strobe lighting and those with quiet, muted moments of connection stand out in the bazaar.
This contrast is particularly evident when Sofia and Elina first share a connection. In a quiet scene at night outside where Elina helped Sofia through an anxiety attack, Elina watches Sofia dance and is inspired to frantically write a song in her honor. The contrast between the quiet nighttime scene, and Sofia’s chaotic, dramatic dance performance in the dark broken up by flashing lights creates a sense of breathlessness — further emphasized by shots of Elina with a bright spotlight on her back as she scribbles frantically, writing Sofia a love song. This dicotomy perfectly encapsulates the film’s thesis about the overlap and generative power of art and obsession, as in this moment Sofia creates a connection with Elina and shows off her talent for dance, while Elina is inspired both to get closer to Sofia and to take her music more seriously.
The slow escalation of Elina’s obsession with Sofia is well-paced, as she starts out as largely sympathetic. Initially, Elina’s insecurity masks a lot of her psychotic tendencies, her harm of those around her steadily going from regrettable mistakes to disturbingly intent. On the other hand, Sofia is introduced as very self-centered, as she lavishes Elina with attention only when she is bored or stressed. But over time, this is tempered by revelations of how overwhelmed and burdened Sofia is by her father and dance school’s expectations. And as the film continues, her selfishness becomes a function of how she is devoted to her craft and desperate to be successful.
The film opens by underscoring Elina’s shyness as she hides at a party and then becomes too overwhelmed to freestyle with her friends, despite being an aspiring rapper. During the title credits, as she walks home in the dark and raps passionately to the city skyline. The camera follows her from behind, creating a strong image of a desperately aspiring but insecure young artist, for whom fame and recognition are just out of reach. Sloan’s acting — with an understated affect and careful use of body language when Elina is calculating how to manipulate someone — is powerful throughout.
Elina’s actions become more and more reckless and dangerous as the film continues, however, causing active harm to everyone around her as she tries to keep Sofia to herself. Sofia tolerates and even enjoys it at first, craving her undivided attention when she isn’t occupied with her dancing, and only begins to become concerned after it threatens her life. But instead of devolving into a stereotypical flight of the victim or a cheap slasher, Sofia’s sociopathic disregard for other people’s feelings becomes clearer as Elina’s actions become more horrifying. Sloan’s deadpan expressions and flat, coaxing voice while Elina manipulates the people around her is chilling, and in combination with the natural, expressive manner Kassovitz brings to Sofia, their devolving relationship is electric to watch.
The motif of the song that Elina crafted for Sofia — which effectively began Elina’s obsession — supports the arc of the film exceptionally well. The song appears in full three times — one with only Elina frantically scribbling the lyrics cut with Sofia dancing, later in full when Sofia unwittingly plays the song in front of all her friends at a party, and then onstage at a performance, where Sofia hears a new, extended version and realizes that not only is Sofia in love with her, but Elina will do anything to control her. Sofia’s reaction to this moment characterizes the film, as its choice to avoid stereotypes, trite messaging, or a neat ending makes “Heartbeast” a magnetizing watch.

Emerging from Rochester, New York, Eto has steadily carved a niche for himself within the underground hip-hop scene over his two-decade-long career. Renowned for his distinctive storytelling and matter-of-fact delivery, he has worked with the likes of DJ Muggs, V Don, Ransom and 38 Spesh. Eto's foray into the rap game began at an early age and he has been relentless in his pursuit of stardom ever since. His music conjures up images of contemporary mobster films, drawing listeners into his meticulously woven narratives of street life in Rochester.
Eto's introduction to music began with his mother, who instilled a love of words in him from a young age. Despite dropping out before high school, Eto continued to develop his vocabulary and hone his skills as an artist. Eto attributes his wit and vast lyrical ability to his mother's influence.
"I gotta thank my Mama,” Eto said. “She was pretty strict with me. I would say definitely she is to blame for my ways.”
Eto first began experimenting with producing and rapping in his mother’s basement in Rochester. In 2020, the rapper teased a yet unreleased project called “Mama’s Basement,” which he produced entirely by himself. Eto jokingly recalled the early days of recording at home, emphasizing his mother’s constant support.
“I drove her through hell, she would stomp on the floor,” the rapper said. “When she got upset she would speak in Spanish, but she was the biggest supporter indeed. She loves all my friends.”
When asked about his creative process, Eto emphasizes the importance of the beat in bringing his stories to life.
"Really, it has to be the music, the beat,” the rapper said. “There's no way I'm going to write if I'm unsure of the beat."
Over his 20-year career, Eto has collaborated with some of the most notable names in hip-hop, such as producer V Don, with whom he has been working since 2007. Their first project together was released on MySpace and laid the groundwork for their future collaborations, including their fan-favorite album "Omertà," released in 2017.
“Me and V Don have been working together since ’07,” Eto said. “We released our first song together when I met him on MySpace.”
This year Eto plans to release his new album “Kings Highway,” which features a collaboration with the legendary Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon. This project, he believes, will stand alongside “Omertà” and “Hell's Roof,” the rapper’s 2019 tape with DJ Muggs, as one of his most significant works to date.
“By far, outside of me and V Don’s ‘Omerta,’ ‘Kings Highway’ is going to be my biggest,” Eto said. “It's going to be my breakthrough.”
While preparing for the roll out for “Kings Highway,” Eto also revealed that he has begun work on a sequel to “Omertà” with V Don.
“‘Omertà 2’ on the way,” he said. “I'm probably like eight records in. I got featuring Ransom, featuring Conway the Machine, and featuring Crystal Caines.”
Eto’s dedication to his craft has not gone unnoticed, as he has amassed a significant following both locally and internationally. Reflecting on his career of over two decades, the rapper shared that a solid work ethic has been most instrumental to his success as an independent artist.
“It is crucially imperative that once you got the ball bouncing to not stop,” Eto said. “We have a lot of work to do.”
Aside from his solo endeavors, Eto is also committed to uplifting his hometown of Rochester. He has been a long-time friend and collaborator with fellow Rochester rapper 38 Spesh, with whom he created the “Flour City” series, a trilogy of songs that pay homage to Rochester. Eto shared plans to record a full-length album with Spesh after the rapper finishes up his nationwide “Beyond Belief Tour” this summer.
“We completed the ‘Flour City’ series, the three-part one, because we wanted to name the album that,” Eto said. “Once this tour is done, he just included me in the tour, we’re definitely gonna start this album of ours that we've been talking about for awhile now.”
Despite the challenges that come with being an independent artist, Eto remains focused and continues to make strides in the hip-hop world. With a string of successful projects under his belt and a new album on the horizon, there’s zero doubt that Eto will continue to captivate listeners with his gritty brand of storytelling and lyrical prowess. As Eto himself states, “We're not going to stop grinding.”

For Annika Huprikar ’24, music feels like a second language. A junior in the Harvard-Berklee College of Music five-year dual degree program, Huprikrar is pursuing a BA in Computer Science from Harvard College as well as a Master’s of Film Scoring from Berklee College of Music.
Her energy and passion for music were striking as Huprikar remarked on her experience in her dual degree, and how she splits up her time.
“I usually try and take half of my coursework in CS every semester,” she said. “Honestly ideally, I would like to really pursue music more than CS; I know that by myself.”
Pursuing an Earth and Planetary Sciences secondary, which takes up one class slot a semester, Huprikar explores liberally with her one remaining class slot, having taken courses in art history, government, and comparative literature. In addition, she takes two classes in film scoring at Berklee each semester, learning among others how to write for Brass or score a video game.
With a complete studio setup in her dorm room, including a full-length 88-key MIDI controller and two 5’’ KRK Rokit Studio speakers, as well as an audio interface and a mic, Huprikar can experiment with sequencing and mixing at any time of day. The setup is symbolic of how comfortable and ingrained music is within her everyday life.
“The great thing about these projects at Berklee is that they feel less like homework and more like you’re working on a continuous thing,” said Huprikar. “It’s really, really fun.”
Huprikar started playing piano at the age of six. Classically trained, she considered piano to be “her sport.” In high school, Huprikar entered the competition circuit as well as discovered the joy of composing. After noticing patterns in the classical scores she’d be playing growing up, Huprikar endeavored to create her own, more modern-leaning compositions.
In high school, she wrote a violin, cello, piano trio, then expanded to orchestral pieces.
A “mainly self-taught” scorer and conductor, she learned to use Sibelius and Dorico to notate her compositions, and then would conduct student groups in playing her work.
Nearing the end of high school, Huprikar realized that music production, and specifically film scoring, which brought together her fascination with film and music, piqued her interest more than pure piano performance.
She loved watching movies, and was specifically entranced by Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack in “The Dark Knight Rises”: “it has such grit to the score,” she stated. Inspired by Zimmer, she realized that she could marry her interests in film and music and started paving her own path in the film scoring world.
A long established practice for Kuprikar is scoring silent scenes: movie sequences stripped of sound. Her mentors — one in LA and one in New York — would give her scenes without music from films that have already been scored. The exercise, then, would be to score the scene in an original way, to push her creative boundaries.
“The test,” Huprikar said, is to really get creative, think about things in a critical way; what are you seeing visually and how do you then take that and transform it into sound? musical narrative?
She chose the Harvard-Berklee Dual Degree Program because she felt that it offered direction beyond classical performance or theory, which differed from that offered at traditional music departments — even Harvard’s very own.
“I’m trying to do as much as I can out of class.”
To that end, Huprikar has been involved in the First-Year Musical, “The Fortunates,” and The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers. She also shared that she had been asked to score some student projects. She makes audio backings for friends’ short films, and looks forward to upcoming senior theses where she will likely have the opportunity to collaborate with peers in the TDM or AFVS departments.
Originally from Chicago, Huprikar loves musicals, often watching them while growing up with her parents and friends. To this end, Hurpikar tried composing with lyrics for the 2021 First-Year Musical, where she worked with casted performers to personalize her score to the vocal ranges of the actors themselves after having worked one-on-one with them.
Although she realized she was not as interested in composing for musical theater or working with lyrics, she still appreciated the experience.
“Writing with lyrics in mind versus instrumental makes it like a different battle. It’s challenging.”
An avid and relentless explorer even within the music industry, Huprikar keeps her eyes set ahead and upwards. Now, she stays busy with Harvard and Berklee assignments, scoring competitions, and independent projects within and outside of the Harvard ecosystem. Most recently, her work was recorded, then premiered alongside seven other pieces at Sanders Theatre by Ensemble Veritas, a professional choir.
“It was like a masterclass rehearsal recording session.”
When asked about whether she would pursue music full-time, Huprikar was enthusiastic.
“I mean, every industry has its uncertainties. But I think there’s no mistake or misunderstanding that Fine Art and Music is a very risky, unstable industry. But I love music so much that I’m not averse to taking that path,” she said.
To that end, she sees her studies in CS as supplement to her ultimate goal of music. Studying technology, to her, has given her a path to understanding how to understand and conceptualize abstract backend processes in relation to music.
Understanding signal processing and how to apply effects — distortion, for instance — on different audio tracks to create the desired sonic effect on a theoretical, conceptual level allows her to get closer with music and interact with it through a different lens.
“It makes me more open minded and more willing to actually learn the technological know-how to work in music.”
Even though artificial intelligence presents Huprikar with a unique opportunity to merge her academic interests in Computer Science and Music, she shared that she never intended to study their interaction.
“I believe in technology corrupting the authenticity of the human creative process,” she said. I can do automations of things that I need to be done. But when it comes to the actual creative compositions idea, I want that to come from me.
Huprikar intends to graduate Harvard College with a degree in Computer Science in 2024 and complete her Masters in Film Scoring from Berklee in 2025. Afterwards, her dream is to live in New York or L.A. scoring films, attending festivals, and expanding the scale of her musical explorations.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For 50 years, students and faculty have repeatedly organized to expand Ethnic Studies at Harvard. We’ve made some progress, but much work remains to be done: “Cluster hires” and administrative efforts to expand faculty position offerings are not nearly enough. At Yale, students enjoy the benefits of a full-fledged undergraduate degree program in Ethnic Studies, and our colleagues at Princeton have gained from our faculty losses.
With students having organized for Ethnic Studies at Harvard just last week, we should think critically about the fight to promote this curriculum beyond the walls of our University. It may be in our best interest to refocus attention towards planting the seeds of an ethnic studies education earlier — in our elementary and secondary schools.
Massachusetts House of Representatives Bill S.288/H.542, referred to the Education Committee this February, calls to “promote racially inclusive curriculum in schools,” establishing a fund to incorporate the histories and contributions of marginalized and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups into the curriculum of K-12 schools.
Why should we care? Significant evidence shows that developing cultural competence and an appreciation for society’s diversity and historical nuance within students early on is vital. A 2021 Stanford study found that ethnic studies curriculum in the San Francisco Unified School District had a “remarkably prolonged and strong positive impact,” helping students “increas[e] their overall engagement in school, probability of graduating and likelihood of enrolling in college.” Moreover, the study demonstrated that ethnic studies had increased students’ sense of belonging and relevance in their communities.
I’m keenly aware of the salience of race in debates over K-12 curriculum. This is not a piece whose goal is to strike down every qualm with critical race theory or add fire to the flames of a hyperpolarized discussion that’s been broken beyond repair. Rather, I aim to set terms for a more well-intentioned conversation over the educational and social-emotional merits of a racially-inclusive curriculum, putting aside racial dog whistles in the pursuit of maximizing students’ wellbeing and education.
While ethnic studies may seem like a nebulous pursuit, particularly for younger students, we can visualize it through Terry Kawi’s metaphor of windows and mirrors. According to Kawi, an English and Language Arts teacher from California, racially-inclusive education would provide both windows — frames through which students experience cultures and lives apart from their own — and mirrors — opportunities for students to see themselves reflected in the narratives that they learn — in their pursuit of a balanced education.
Beyond the benefits that racially inclusive curricula yield for students, K-12 ethnic studies in Massachusetts may just be the catalyst for a sustainable push for the subject at Harvard. Preventing burnout and sustaining momentum as we fight for a formalized Ethnic Studies curriculum at the College requires a student body confident in the field’s pedagogical value. If we know that ethnic studies programs at the primary and secondary levels work to uplift students and drive engagement, expanding these frameworks at the K-12 level could help the department find a stronger footing at Harvard.
Perhaps this doesn’t concern you — perhaps you may not see the need for a specialized Ethnic Studies department at Harvard. After all, why is this specific educational niche one that we ought to promote?
Harvard is synonymous with the gold standard. Whether we as students agree with its educational relevance or not, Harvard is the paragon of academic excellence. Our curricular offerings run the gamut, and at a school where every admitted class of students currently on campus is majority non-white, the absence of a department devoted to the critical analysis of our student body’s diverse racial and ethnic perspectives is inexcusable.
Whether one chooses to study Ethnic Studies at Harvard or not, the existence of a department on campus that willfully and rigorously investigates corrupted historical, scientific, and political narratives is critical. The only way that Harvard will continue to live up to its academic reputation is to develop students and push forth a curriculum that embodies critical, constant questioning.
We must recognize that the lack of Ethnic Studies on campus is symptomatic of a national unfamiliarity with and antagonism to critical education on race and ethnicity. Absent rigorous educational reform at the K-12 level (through legislation like the Massachusetts State Act to Promote Racially Inclusive Curriculum in Schools), Harvard students may continue to arrive on our campus lacking the cultural competence and complete education necessary to appreciate and sustain our diverse community.
We know that empowering younger students with the windows and mirrors to see their own experiences and the experiences of others reflected in their education yields remarkably positive educational outcomes. So perhaps it’s time for us organizing for Ethnic Studies to expand our audience, vying not only for a balanced education at Harvard, but also for the Harvard students of tomorrow.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A year ago, Harvard authorized double concentrations for the first time. The move was a welcome increase in academic flexibility, allowing students to pursue multiple interests simultaneously without the more complicated requirements of joint concentrations.
The introduction of double concentrations also means that students can spend a lot more of their class time just meeting requirements. With most concentrations requiring 10 to 14 credits, a double concentrator can now fill up more than two thirds of their 32 total class slots with requirements. A highly ambitious student can even try to rack up two concentrations, one secondary, and a language citation.
Double concentrations and language citations seem to represent a choice by Harvard to permit students to take on a lot more structure in their course load than the basic requirement of one concentration, if they choose to do so. Nevertheless, the administration remains unwilling to permit one particular type of course-load structure: multiple secondary fields.
This incongruity exists despite the fact that concentration requirements are not only more numerous than a secondary’s four to six courses, but they usually also involve more difficult requirements than a secondary. In simple terms, Harvard allows students to be experts in two subjects and dabble in another, but not to be experts in one and dabble in two. In one fell swoop, Harvard has both added flexibility to its curricular requirements and created a glaring inconsistency.
As far as I can tell, it is not clear why Harvard has failed to create double secondaries — whether it is an oversight or a deliberate feature of curricular design. Double secondaries would likely be quite popular. More than 50 percent of students currently complete a secondary field, and because most require few courses, many students likely already complete the requirements for multiple secondaries but have to arbitrarily choose one to be officially awarded.
Perhaps administrative higher-ups determined that double secondaries would be too popular or easy to get and are thus less deserving of recognition than double concentrations. Indeed, one could argue that students who already have one secondary would be better off choosing their remaining classes without seeking to satisfy additional requirements.
This view would be hard to reconcile with permitting double concentrations, but perhaps administrators perceive that an additional concentration requires so much effort that only the truly passionate will pursue them. By contrast, double secondaries would be too easy to obtain for students with merely a casual interest or a desire to improve their resumé.
However, those arguments are unconvincing. For starters, because they require so many additional courses, double concentrations are much more restrictive of course choice than double secondaries. As for academic rigor, it is not necessarily easier to be competent in three subjects (demonstrated by a concentration and two secondaries) than to have deep competence in only two: their relative difficulties will vary from person to person.
Harvard should thus extend its good sense in allowing double concentrations to the realm of secondary fields. The most coherent option would be to allow up to three secondary fields, at least for single concentrators, since three secondaries’ requirements would add up to roughly as much as a second concentration.
What, then, will become of students’ unstructured exploration of different academic subjects? I think it will live on. First, many students choose to come to Harvard in part because it offers the option to take varied classes outside of structured requirements. There is no reason to believe that they will stop doing so simply because they would have additional structured options. Second, it is precisely because students already engage in this sort of exploration, pursuing various disciplines without worrying about recognition on their degree, that many likely already meet the requirements for several secondaries. Allowing multiple secondaries would only give official acknowledgement to this exploration.
Ultimately, the introduction of double concentrations, despite the inconsistency that I’ve highlighted, is a good thing for students. But Harvard mustn’t stop at concentrations when prioritizing flexibility in student requirements. It’s time to take the next logical step in ensuring that students can design the best academic plan for themselves. It’s time to permit multiple secondaries.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In popular media, like the film “The Social Network,” Harvard is portrayed as a hub for networking. Students flock to career fairs to connect with top companies while fielding numerous LinkedIn requests from peers — happily accepting them all in case we truly are speaking with the next Mark Zuckerburg.
But why are we so driven to make these social connections? What is the value of this hustle?
Networking is intrinsic to human biology. Evolutionarily, our primate ancestors began associating in groups of males and females for greater protection and safety in numbers. This social structure has prevailed across the evolutionary lineage, appearing in both primates and humans today.
From a neuropharmacological perspective, social connections cause our bodies to release oxytocin, the love hormone, which subsequently triggers the release of serotonin, the happy neurotransmitter. Together, these two substances reinforce social behaviors through our brain’s reward circuits.
Our acuity for complex social connections through networking stems partially from our ability to recognize and respond to emotions. Mirror neurons in the brain allow us to relate to the emotions of others by ‘mirroring’ the physiological responses associated with them. This ability seems to provide the basis of empathy, which helps us build strong relationships and shmooze potential employers.
But, how do we decide which relationships we should make, and with whom? Social connections are most evolutionarily favorable when the benefits exceed the costs. Many animals — including insects like ants, which dynamically organize themselves in living bridges — weigh costs and benefits in deciding to act. For primates, often the benefit of social groups is protection, while the cost is competition for resources within the group.
But the cost-benefit analysis of Harvard networking seems to diverge from the animal kingdom, as luckily, many of our basic needs — in both protection and resources — are already met (there are plenty of FlyBy sandwiches to go around). We thus have the potential to make connections with anyone and everyone with little or no consequence; we are afforded the luxury to choose. Rather than networking for survival, we network for problem set buddies, friends in high places, and critical professional connections that can help us secure selective dream jobs and future plans.
This element of choice can lead to some negative consequences of social interactions.
Take for example imposter syndrome, the nagging perception of feeling undeserving. Harvard’s extremely low acceptance rate and the talented student body it recruits make students sometimes wonder: “Why the heck am I here?” or “Do I belong in this social network?”
Imposter syndrome can cause anxiety and stress, and subsequently decrease levels of good hormones, including testosterone, which may limit one’s drive to take risks. Evolutionarily, this perception may have motivated us to strive towards perfection, but it comes at the cost of spiraling negativity.
While networking may help to combat imposter syndrome by finding social groups that we are comfortable with, it can also potentially exacerbate the feeling if our peers confirm our fears and don’t include us in their networks.
The complexities of balancing the positives and negatives of social connections, as well as maintaining awareness of the potential pitfalls have led some scientists to try and determine a ‘friendship limit.’ Perhaps the most famous of these is Dunbar’s number, which, based on the size of various primates’ neocortices (a part of the brain believed to be responsible for social relationships) and their group sizes, posits that humans can have a maximum of 150 meaningful social connections, with nesting circle sizes of 15 good friends and 500 acquaintances.
While this calculation is quite controversial, it nonetheless highlights the importance of making friendships of quality over quantity. It is important to be aware of your role in social situations and consider whether this role aligns with your core values.
Connecting with people is one of the great joys of living in a society. It has enabled us to achieve remarkable things, like entomologists collaborating to collect millions of insect specimens or engineers sending people to the moon. We are in a unique period of time where every person is a node in a truly interconnected network — we are, in essence, an evolutionary masterpiece!
As my column comes to an end, I’m grateful to have been part of your reading network over this semester. While I have examined empirical evidence behind Harvard culture and traditions, there is still much unknown about how we function in our daily lives, and much to question. I hope this column has encouraged you to continue to reflect on the how and why of our actions, and to stop and think about the beauty, and complexity, of the natural world around us!

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 40 students, staff, and supporters rallied in Harvard Yard Friday in support of unionizing undergraduate workers after the University rejected the campaign’s request for voluntary recognition April 7.
Two months after the public launch of the Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union, a group of roughly 15 organizers delivered a neutrality agreement on April 3 to the University’s Office of Labor and Employee Relations that included a request for voluntary recognition.
Four days later, Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul Curran emailed Koby D. Ljunggren, the president of Harvard’s graduate student union — which has voted to affiliate with HUWU — to inform organizers the University would not agree to voluntarily recognizing the union effort.
“The University is steadfast in its position that every eligible student be given the opportunity to make their voices heard on this important matter,” Curran wrote.
Without voluntary recognition, HUWU will have to gain majority support through an official union election conducted by the National Labor Relations Board.
At Friday’s rally, attendees and organizers gave speeches and broke into chants, such as “HUWU, woo-hoo, recognize our union too!” and “An undergraduate workers union: it’s not too much to ask!”
When HUWU organizer Syd D. Sanders ’24 mentioned Curran’s reply during a speech at the rally, the crowd responded with boos.
“Shame on Paul! Shame on Paul!” attendees chanted.
Ljunggren said in an interview after the rally that while the chant was not planned, the Office of Labor and Employee Relations often does not adequately “respect the rights of workers,” adding that “there is a lot of disdain and discontentment from the actions of that office.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment for this article.
At the rally, Sanders said in a speech that Harvard gave serious consideration to recognizing the unionization effort, which he said was “a show of our strength.”
Ljunggren said in their interview that the four-day period that Harvard took to reject HUWU’s voluntary recognition request indicates that the University was “seriously considering and actually having a discussion about” whether to grant recognition.
“At the end of the day, there was no voluntary recognition in part because it’s something Harvard has never done before and I think they just don’t want to start now,” Ljunggren said.
“Most of the time it’s like a one-day turnaround where they’re like ‘No, not interested,’” they added.
The petition comes just weeks after the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers voted to affiliate with HUWU should they win official recognition and ratify their first contract with the University. HUWU will receive organizational support from HGSU-UAW until their first contract is signed.
“We are happy to welcome you into the fold as part of an amalgamated local that has the tools and power to fight for HUWU’s demands and win,” HGSU-UAW organizer Alexandra C. Stanton said at the rally.
HUWU expects to file an election with the National Labor Relations Board in the next few weeks. Once they file, the NLRB will verify that at least 30 percent of eligible employees have signed union authorization cards before an election is conducted.
More than 170 undergraduate workers have signed union cards as of Sunday night. HUWU estimates there are 277 eligible workers who can be represented by HUWU in total, allowing them to determine they have collected cards from around 62 percent of workers.
While organizers had previously suspected the University would contest the total number of eligible workers to prevent HUWU from surpassing the 30 percent threshold, Ljunggren said they “don’t feel there’s any will from the University to mount a big campaign against this effort.”
When the grad student union was pushing for unionization in 2018, the movement was “tough on the University,” Ljunggren said.
“I think the University does not want to repeat something like that,” they added. “I think they want to get it right the first time.”
In an April 6 interview with The Crimson, Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said should a majority of workers vote for a union during an NLRB-directed election, the University “will act in good faith.”
Harvard has not yet responded to the neutrality agreement itself. At the rally, Sanders said that if Harvard agreed to neutrality, they would be agreeing “not to retaliate against organizers and abstain from union-busting practices.”
“It’s not going to be easy to win these things,” Stanton said. “Harvard will fight you like hell every step of the way.”
“Harvard is a business and it operates just like any other big business,” she added.
Sanders said organizers specifically planned Friday’s rally at the end of National Student Employment Week, for which Harvard held events distributing free merchandise and food.
At the rally, speakers from HUWU as well as HGSU-UAW, Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers, and the union representing Harvard’s custodial workers, 32BJ Service Employees International Union, called on Harvard to raise wages and ensure workplace stability.
“There is no reason workers who work 20 hours a week feel scared to ask their bosses about a raise when they’ve been in their jobs for years,” said Marcus W. Knoke ’24, who currently works at Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study as a multimedia intern.
A major issue that HUWU has targeted is what it sees as the lack of an official process for hiring. Workers said they do not sign contracts when employed.
“Undergrads deserve to know if they’ll be employed year to year, if worksites will reopen, if they’ll be able to live off the wages they’re provided because not everyone at Harvard is rich,” Ljunggren said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to confirm whether undergrads sign contracts when employed by Harvard.
HUWU joins another unionization campaign on campus: Harvard’s non-tenure-track preceptors and postdocs, who began their card campaign in early February. HUWU organizers speculated that Harvard is more concerned about Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers’ union drive than that of the undergraduates.
“I think that they’re in a state of being quite overwhelmed by other organizing campaigns on campus, specifically the Harvard Academic Workers Union, because there’s about 6,000 of them and they’re making a lot more money than us,” Sanders said.
HUWU organizer Austin Siebold ’23 said the University should be “pretty worried” about the push for unionization on campus.
“All together, to me, if I’m Harvard, it paints a pretty troubling picture,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard students, faculty, and alumni gathered to learn about advocacy for ethnic studies during a series of events held last week.
The events, part of the inaugural Ethnic Studies Week, continue a decadeslong push for the creation of a degree-granting ethnic studies department at Harvard that has inspired demonstrations, proposal submissions, and letters to administrators.
Ethnic Studies Week was organized by the Task Force for Asian American Progressive Advocacy and Studies in conjunction with the Harvard Ethnic Studies Coalition and the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard.
Zoha A. Ibrahim ’26, a TAPAS co-coordinator, said Ethnic Studies Week is a continuation of affirmative action advocacy from last semester around the high-profile Supreme Court lawsuit brought against Harvard that would ban race-conscious admissions.
“Last semester, we did a lot of advocacy with affirmative action, and I think affirmative action and ethnic studies are very much intertwined,” Ibrahim said. “So I think we really wanted to just use this week as a chance to build momentum.”
Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences hired three new professors — Taeku Lee, Erika Lee, and Jesse E. Hoffnung-Garskof ’93 — in mid-2022 as a part of an ethnic studies cluster hire, but the University still lacks a formal ethnic studies department.
TAPAS co-coordinator Rebecca S. Zhang ’26 said Ethnic Studies Week was organized in order to “reinvigorate interest” in advocacy in the wake of a new incoming University president and FAS dean.
“With the cluster hire and the new EMR lecture hires, I think we also wanted to make a statement that, first of all, we’re really grateful for these hires and we’re super glad that everyone’s coming, but also, we want more,” Zhang said. “I think that’s really important to say because I think that what we have now is not enough, and we want to make that clear.”
A Harvard spokesperson referenced outgoing FAS Dean Claudine Gay’s 2019 statement committing to “building ethnic studies at Harvard” in response to a request for comment.
The week’s programming kicked off with a teach-in, which featured a presentation on ethnic studies and Harvard’s history and a discussion with guest speakers, including current and past undergraduate and faculty advocates for the department.
Attendee Priyanka Mukhara ’26 said it was “shocking” and “just very interesting” to learn that Harvard lacks an ethnic studies department “despite all its resources and connections.”
“The fact that students continuously age out or graduate, so the movement has to restart again — it made me see how ethnic studies is a very people-dependent movement, and I think that’s a big strength and a big weakness,” Mukhara said.
On Wednesday, TAPAS hosted a panel discussion featuring Mai Du, an advocate for ethnic studies in K-12 schools, and Jane Sujen Bock ’81, who sits on the Board of Directors of the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard.
In an emailed statement, Bock wrote that it is “infuriating” that Harvard still does not have an ethnic studies department after 51 years of student activism.
“It’s wonderful that Dean Gay’s cluster hire is bringing three star Ethnic Studies faculty to Harvard in the next couple years, but that doesn’t begin to make up for the great scholars who have recently left or are about to leave,” Bock wrote.
“Unlike every other comparable institution, Harvard is failing to meet the needs of its students in this area and is harming its ability to contribute to a changing world,” she added.
Du, who grew up in Vietnam, said she is an advocate for ethnic studies because she “experienced firsthand” re-education camps under Communist rule.
“There are just certain academic content and studies that have not been very reflective and accurate to the history of all people,” Du said.
Du said incorporating ethnic studies in curricula is important for students’ mental health and academic performance.
“You’re more motivated to go to school because you see yourself in textbooks,” she said. “You’re learning about yourself and your families, and your lived experiences are honored, embraced, and uplifted.”
Currently, Harvard offers a secondary field in Ethnicity, Migration, Rights and a field of specialization in ethnic studies within the History and Literature concentration for undergraduates.
Ibrahim said she finds it frustrating that other institutions have more courses related to ethnic studies, while Harvard only offers EMR as a secondary.
“It deserves to be a full-fledged entity and it deserves to have departmentalization and funding,” she said. “And all those things help Harvard students and they will end up helping Harvard in the long run.”
Zhang said this year’s inaugural Ethnic Studies Week was a jumping-off point for further student activism and organizing around ethnic studies.
“We just wanted to gather people together who are interested in ethnic studies and want to help advocate for it,” Zhang added. “So I think this week was kind of a starting point for us to hopefully build on for future advocacy.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Department of Peace held its inaugural Cultural Impact Award ceremony Saturday, hosting philosopher and former Harvard professor Cornel R. West ’74 and presidential candidate Marianne D. Williamson at a two-hour long event at Sanders Theatre.
The Department of Peace is a social justice organization that aims to bring together activists and leaders to discuss topics including politics, culture, academics, and the environment. The group is not affiliated with Harvard.
In addition to Williamson and West, the ceremony featured sportswriter Peter Gammons and Bernard Franklin, the managing director of nonprofit Uncornered and a former fellow at Harvard’s Advanced Leadership Initiative. Soul band MFSB also gave a performance during the event.
West has long had a contentious relationship with Harvard and has left the University twice: first, in 2002, after a high-profile dispute with former President Lawrence H. Summers, and for the second time in 2021 after Harvard allegedly denied his request to be considered for tenure.
After his second departure, he returned to Union Theological Seminary, where he is currently serving as professor of Philosophy and Christian Practice.
During his remarks Saturday, West described the long-running tradition and importance of music to Black history and the role that it has played in helping fight injustice. Music has enabled Black people to “stay in contact with their dignity, their humanity, their sense of perseverance,” West said.
“Black music is the greatest artistic breakthrough in the most barbaric of recorded times and the 20th century. No other century has generated such levels of barbarity and bestiality of 150 million of our fellow human beings dead in the name of some ideology,” he added.
West emphasized the importance of listening to all voices, especially those from marginalized groups.
“I come from a tradition that says a condition of truth is to allow those suffering to speak. If you’re not hearing the voices of the least of these, you’re not going to be truthful,” West said. “You’re going to have a lot of mendacious formulations.”
Williamson, who staged an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, launched her campaign for the 2024 race in March. Williamson, an author and spiritual leader, came to prominence as a frequent guest on the Oprah Winfrey Show, leading to her reputation as Winfrey’s “spiritual advisor.”
In her speech Saturday, Williamson said the U.S. is “not a peaceful society because we are a violent society.”
“The reason we don’t have peace in the United States is because we do not have justice. We do not have criminal justice. We do not have racial justice. We do not have environmental justice and we do not have economic justice,” Williamson said.
Williamson said the existence of poverty is one example of injustice in the U.S.
“Poverty is an expression of violent economic policies when 39 percent of Americans in the richest country in the world are now skipping meals in order to pay their rent,” Williamson said.
Williamson pointed to four methods of establishing peace. These included expanding economic opportunities for women, increasing educational opportunities for children, ameliorating violence against women, and eliminating unnecessary human suffering.
“You can have all these wonderful conversations where we talk about the importance of peace, but we as a generation need to do more than say what we already know,” Williamson said. “We need to do something about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former acting United States Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen discussed the growing threat of antisemitism at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday evening.
The event was moderated by Setti D. Warren, who was recently appointed permanent director of the IOP. At the forum, Rosen, who graduated from Harvard Law School in 1982, discussed how antisemitic incidents have risen sharply over the past decade, as well as his experience as chair of the Virginia Commission to Combat Antisemitism.
“Some of the urgency that I see now is, it feels like there isn’t a day that goes by that we don't hear of some kind of episode,” Rosen said during the event.
Rosen, who is Jewish, said he believes recent cases of antisemitism are more extreme than those he recalled from his childhood.
“I don’t really remember this being a big issue or a big problem,” he said. “It’s not to say it ever went away.”
Referring to recent antisemitic incidents in New York, Rosen said he is concerned that hate crimes and hateful sentiment are taking place “on the streets of a major American city” — not just confined to fringe groups.
“For 2022, it was up to 219 incidents on college campuses,” Rosen said about displays of antisemitism. “This isn’t again a problem of the far corners of our society — it’s on our college campuses.”
Rosen and Warren also discussed the inadequacy of Holocaust education in the United States. Warren said “startling” portions of millennials and Gen Z adults have minimal knowledge of the Holocaust or believe it is a “myth or over exaggerated.”
“It’s a testament to the failure somewhere in our educational system,” Rosen said.
Rosen proposed four areas of improvement in efforts to combat antisemitism: antisemitism reporting databases, Holocaust education, security and law enforcement responses, and government policies on discrimination.
On the issue of improving Holocaust education, Rosen discussed recommendations proposed by the Virginia Commission to Combat Antisemitism, including adding curriculum on the history of antisemitism and implementing remembrance days into the school system.
Rosen also suggested creating antisemitism courses and centers at state law schools.
“The tools of the law are actually somewhat powerful,” Rosen said, adding that legal approaches are “not a panacea, but it’s one of the things to be done.”
Besides tackling antisemitism through legal measures, Rosen said it is important to combat the negative “cultural” impacts “when a professional football player or musician or somebody makes a very public antisemitic comment.”
“One of the things we really have to do is not just denounce these episodes but ensure that they aren't through the side door, normalizing it and making it socially acceptable,” Rosen said.

Harvard undergraduates joined tens of thousands of runners from across the globe to complete the 127th Boston Marathon on Monday, starting from Hopkinton — a town in the MetroWest — and moving toward the finish line in Boston’s Copley Square.
The Boston Athletic Association has hosted the marathon annually since its inception in 1897, when it was first organized by United States Olympic Team Manager John Graham. The race has almost always been held on Patriot’s Day — currently designated as the third Monday of April — which commemorates the first battles of the American Revolution.
This year’s race also marked the 10th anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings, when extremists killed three people and injured hundreds more after setting off pressure cooker bombs at the race’s finish line. The city has since observed One Boston Day every year on April 15 as a day of remembrance of the tragedy.
To participate in the Boston Marathon, runners must have a qualifying time of at most three hours for men ages 18–34, and three-and-a-half hours for women of the same age range. Runners who fail to meet their qualifying time can still participate on behalf of a member of the Official Charity Program by fundraising at least $5,000 for a charity of their choosing.
Almost all of the participating Harvard students qualified for the race through fundraising.
Five of the students running, Maia J. Alberts ’23, Andrew C. Holmes ’24, Jacob R. Jimenez ’24, Michael D. Wallace ’22-’23, and Crimson News editor Paz E. Meyers ’25, ran for the Harvard College Marathon Challenge — a group of Harvard affiliates that fundraises for Boston-area youth and families through running. Funds raised will be donated to the Phillips Brooks House Association, a Harvard student-run public service organization.
Annie Miall ’23 ran for Mass Eye and Ear — a teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School. Miall said she raised $10,000, double the minimum required to qualify.
Bridget S. O’Kelly ’23, who only found out she would be running in the marathon last Thursday, made it into the race through less conventional means.
O’Kelley said she was at a Winthrop House Senior Common Room event in February when she happened to tell an alumnus that she was training for the Providence Marathon, adding she particularly wanted to run in the Boston Marathon.
“I’d seen my brother run it, and it’s a really big deal in Boston,” O’Kelley said.
“And then he was just like, ‘Well, I can get you a spot,’” she added.
After months of back-and-forth between the two over email and efforts by the alum to secure the spot through his contacts, it still wasn’t confirmed by the final Wednesday before the race. She reached out to her contact thanking him for his effort, which she assumed was unsuccessful.
“And then on Thursday I got an email that just said: ‘You’re in.’ Basically he had contacted some people who were really high up in the BAA — some former Harvard alum,” O’Kelley said, adding she was told she was the last entry when she checked in for the race on Friday.
In an interview prior to the start of the race, Miall said she associated the marathon with a sense of solidarity.
“The entire city of Boston is running — it’s not just the runner,” Miall said.
“I was just so, so moved by everyone coming out to support us running, especially everyone who helped me get this far — my friends and loved ones,” she added. “I think I burst into tears of joy five times. Maybe more — only the spectators will really know.”
Jimenez wrote in a message that he felt a sense of pride running the race as a Harvard student.
“It was very special to have a Harvard jersey and get cheered on as ‘Harvard’ by so many strangers, and I’ve never felt more proud to be a student and member of the Boston community,” he wrote.
Alberts said two standout moments from the race included seeing her blockmates — whom she heard cheering from afar — and when one of her friends “hopped onto the course” to run a stretch of it with her.
“It’s been kind of like a dream,” Alberts said.
Correction: April 19, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Annie Miall ’23 is a member of the Harvard College Marathon Challenge. In fact, she is not a member.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Law School Space Law Society hosted a conversation on the ethical and legal concerns of space mining with three space policy experts in Wasserstein Hall on Monday.
The talk kicked off the fifth annual Space Week, a series of outreach events held by the Space Consortium, an organization of space-focused faculty and student groups at Harvard, MIT, and other Boston-area universities.
Boston College space law professor Alissa J. Haddaji, who founded the Space Consortium, moderated the discussion.
The panelists inclided Erika Nesvold, a co-founder of the nonprofit JustSpace Alliance, which advocates for equity and ethics in space; Frans G. von der Dunk, a space law professor at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln; and Michelle L.D. Hanlon, an air and space law instructor at the University of Mississippi.
During the discussion, Nesvold discussed the nature of space mining and its significance to humanity.
“Mining in general is extracting valuable non-living material from the environment,” Nesvold said. “On Earth, that can be anything from salts to coal to diamonds to metals. But in space the kinds of things we're interested in are platinum-group metals from asteroids because they’re rare on Earth.”
Nesvold also said some resources — like water — might be extracted to support development in space.
“NASA’s current ‘Moon to Mars’ program means that they want to go back to the moon first through the Artemis program — talking about Artemis I and II — and that would teach us a lot of things about how to live in space, how to extract resources, how to use those resources,” she said.
Hanlon described legal concerns surrounding space mining, explaining that Article II of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits nations from claiming sovereignty over any part of outer space. But according to Hanlon, 23 nations have signed the Artemis Accords, a 2020 agreement that states resource extraction is not the same as claiming territory — which would make space mining legal under international law.
Hanlon said she expected space extraction would happen eventually regardless of legal uncertainty.
“If we are going to expand off of our Earth, we’re going to need to use resources,” she said. “The understanding that that is going to happen, I think, is clear. The question of what we call what our relationship with those resources is is an ethical one.”
Von der Dunk discussed balancing public and private interests, including “public interest in space, safety, security and international peace, the environment and sustainability and even science.”
“This general public interest of humankind should be preserved and protected, but has to be balanced with the bona fide interests of the private sector,” he said.
Nesvold challenged the idea that resources in space are unlimited.
“All the resources we’re talking about are finite resources. As much as people looking for investors want to talk about space being infinite and there being infinite resources, these are finite, limited resources, they’re not going to last forever,” Nesvold said. “How much do we owe it to future generations to not take everything valuable right now?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard honored Edwin Bush Jourdain Jr., Class of 1921, a Black College graduate who led efforts to dismantle the University’s segregationist freshman dorm policy, with a portrait in Winthrop House’s Senior Common Room.
Situated alongside photographs of other prominent civil rights leaders, the portrait was unveiled March 31 at a celebratory gathering attended by students, Jourdain’s living family, and Vice Provost for Special Projects Sara N. Bleich.
Jourdain’s son, Spencer C.D. Jourdain ’61, selected an image of his father from his time as a student at the College for exhibition.
In remarks at the event, Bleich cited a landmark University report released last year that detailed how the institution of slavery shaped Harvard. The report named dozens of Harvard leaders and donors who enslaved people and are today memorialized on Harvard buildings.
“The report also identifies some of the really courageous individuals, some of the first Black students at Harvard who pushed back, who drove toward equity. And Edwin Jourdain is one of those people,” Bleich said during the ceremony, according to the Harvard Gazette.
While Jourdain was studying at Harvard Business School, William J. Knox Jr., Class of 1925 — an incoming Black freshman and a childhood friend of Jourdain — had his housing assignment rescinded soon after he arrived to take his in-person exams. Jourdain had lived in a freshman dorm just four years prior.
This led both men to meet with Dean of Freshmen Philip P. Chase, who responded that University President Abbott L. Lowell, Class of 1877, said he could not compel white students to live with Black students.
Refusing to accept Lowell’s position, Jourdain confronted him directly about his segregationist housing policy.
Lowell maintained that the University’s southern and western demographic would be discomforted by integrated housing, and he said he would rather exclude the comparably fewer Black students from campus residential life than exclude them from the University entirely.
“Dad loved Harvard more than any other person I ever met in my life,” Jourdain said in the ceremony, according to the Gazette. “He had a way of being calm, and that’s what I see when he was confronting President Lowell. He knew who he was, and he had a long history of abolition in his family.”
To combat Lowell’s policy, Jourdain helped to found a social organization of Black men at Harvard called the Nile Club.
The group pushed to end segregation on campus, and in conjunction with media attention garnered by petitions and efforts by Black alumni, the University banned housing discrimination on the basis of race in 1923.
Jourdain would go on to become the first Black alderman of Evanston, Illinois
The portrait unveiling comes as some undergraduates this semester have pushed to dename Winthrop House due to its namesakes’ ties to slavery. In February, hundreds of Harvard affiliates signed a petition in support of denaming.
Student organizers submitted an official denaming proposal to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, though the FAS has not yet responded to their request.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Many Harvard College students opened their emails Sunday in hopes of learning whether they had been accepted to the Harvard Institute of Politics’ competitive Director’s Internship program.
Instead, a number of the program’s applicants have yet to hear back even after the program’s stated decision deadline, student leaders said, while some who have been accepted are unsure if they can afford their summer expenses through the program’s stipend.
“As the executive team, we have received many messages from students concerned about the confusion, lack of communication, and inconsistencies with this year’s Director’s Internship rollout,” IOP President Amen H. Gashaw ’24 said in an interview Monday.
“All host decisions will be shared with students before April 16, 2023,” the Director’s Internship application website reads in bold.
The IOP Director’s Internship is a 10-week summer program that matches more than 200 students with internships in politics, government, and public service. Interns work 35 to 40 hours per week in an unpaid role and receive a stipend of $5,000 — or $5,500 in high-cost areas — from the IOP.
During the pandemic, U.S. inflation rates reached levels not seen since in decades. Still, the Director’s Internship stipend has remained at its pre-pandemic base sum, even after IOP student leadership and internship hopefuls have raised concerns with IOP Director Setti D. Warren.
“We recognize that rising prices have made cost of living difficult to sustain for many students, especially in cities where public service positions are concentrated, including DC and NY,” Gashaw wrote in a statement Thursday.
Warren reaffirmed his commitment to exploring options to meet the financial needs of students in an April 6 statement to The Crimson.
“I am committed to changes necessary to ease financial burden and increase opportunity and I welcome conversations with student leaders to continually reevaluate and strengthen the program,” Warren wrote.
“Making these summer internship opportunities accessible, regardless of financial circumstance, is core to the impact of this program. We strive to support as many students as possible with robust funding both through the Director's Internship and the Summer Stipend programs,” he added.
On Wednesday, four days before the Director’s Internship deadline, the IOP announced students would be able to apply for up to an additional $1,000 of funding through the Priscilla Chan Summer Service Stipend if they are on need-based financial aid from the College.
IOP Vice President Pratyush Mallick ’25 raised concerns about the short turnaround between this announcement and the stipend’s Sunday application deadline. Mallick noted that the application required a 750-word statement.
“It came so late, and it required an additional application. That was the tough part,” Mallick said in an interview. “What I wish had happened is we could have transferred applications to whoever reviews Priscilla Chan and then gone through the supplementary funding process.”
As summer approaches, Gashaw said many Director’s Internship applicants remain confused about their internship prospects, which she attributed to disorganization within the internship program.
Throughout the application period, the Director’s Internship program has repeatedly pushed back application deadlines for internships. Thirteen of the program’s internships now feature Wednesday application deadlines, three days after the program’s stated Sunday decision deadline.
The Director’s Internship program has run three rounds of applications this semester in addition to these extensions. According to three IOP student leaders, the changes to the application timeline were unplanned but were the result of a lack of coordination and clear deadlines between the IOP and organizations hosting summer interns.
Gashaw said the program should prioritize greater transparency and accessibility to applicants.
“I think one thing we want to account for moving forward is that any supplement opportunities we offer are available to every single applicant,” Gashaw said.
Among prospective IOP Director’s interns, some remain unsure how they will afford the costs associated with their internship even with the stipend.
“The $5,500 stipend is definitely not enough to live in such an expensive city,” said Nghia L. Nguyen ’26, who will be based in London as part of the program.
Adelaide E. Parker ’26, a student seeking to participate in the program, said the current stipend fails to cover the costs of housing and groceries in light of inflation-caused price increases.
“I definitely don’t think that the stipend is enough to cover expenses, especially if you’re living in D.C., which is where most of these jobs are,” Parker said.
Interns are expected to work 35 to 40 hours per week for 10 weeks, in some cases putting the $5,500 stipend below equivalent compensation under the minimum wage in cities like New York, where 40 hours of work per week across 10 weeks would net a minimum of $6,000.
“If I end up doing a Director’s Internship job, I definitely will have to either do tutoring work on the side or contribute some of my own money to housing,” Parker said.
In an interview, IOP Treasurer Carter G. Demaray ’25 said Director’s Internship funding is “an issue,” adding that he hopes the IOP will meet the “good standard” set by the Phillips Brooks House Association, which offers a $6,000 fellowship stipend.
“Our team is united in striving to better support students in public service internships, and doing so is the very reason the Director’s Internship program exists,” Gashaw said, referencing the IOP Student Advisory Committee’s efforts.
Two IOP student leaders indicated that the stipend will likely not increase this summer, but they said discussions with Warren remain ongoing.
Nguyen said overall, he is still relieved that the Director’s Internship offers a stipend.
“A stipend helps if I get the job because many internships in the political world are so unfortunately unpaid,” Nguyen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A revived lawsuit filed by Tamara K. Lanier against Harvard over its possession of daguerreotypes she alleges are of her enslaved ancestors will proceed to discovery, a Massachusetts state judge ruled at a hearing last Thursday.
Lanier first filed suit against Harvard in 2019, alleging that the Harvard Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology wrongfully possesses daguerreotypes depicting Renty and Delia, two enslaved people whom Lanier claims are her ancestors.
The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court partially overturned a lower court’s decision to dismiss the suit and ruled that Lanier had the grounds to sue the University for emotional distress in June 2022.
At Thursday’s hearing, Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Christopher K. Barry-Smith ruled from the bench against Harvard’s December 2022 motion to strike clauses from the Lanier team’s third amended complaint filed in October 2022. These clauses claim that the University violated the rights of Renty and Delia by continuing to hold the daguerreotypes and that it breached its duty of care to Lanier by “publicly and cavalierly dismissing” her ancestral claim to Renty and Delia.
Barry-Smith noted that a standard case typically takes a year to go to trial from this point, though he added it could differ in this instance.
Barry-Smith also ruled that Lanier did not need to provide further details to support her claims of emotional distress, saying that the “same set of facts” could be used to determine whether Lanier’s allegations will “rise to the level” of negligence “or worse.”
Barry-Smith did not provide a ruling on Lanier’s requests for relief, as he needs to know if he has the discretion to do so under Massachusetts statutes. He said he will issue a decision “very soon,” adding that his inclination is to wait until trial to rule on what relief Lanier is entitled to.
During the hearing, Harvard’s defense attorney Anton Metlitsky reiterated arguments made in the University’s December 2022 motion to dismiss Lanier’s emotional distress claim. Metlitsky said that Lanier’s request for the restitution of the daguerreotypes to her family is a “form of relief just cannot be available” after the SJC maintained in June 2022 that Lanier does not have a legal property claim to the daguerreotypes.
If Lanier had only brought the property charges in the initial suit, and not the charges of emotional distress, Mitlitsky said, “the case would be over. We wouldn’t be here.”
Lanier’s team argued that the case should proceed to trial and a jury should decide whether she had equitable grounds to repossess the daguerreotypes as a form of punitive damages.
In addition, Metlitsky argued during the hearing that the University seeks to keep the daguerreotypes for educational purposes and “show them in context.”
“That is not possible when there is a legal cloud hanging over the title,” Metlitsky said.
One of Lanier’s lead attorneys, Benjamin L. Crump, argued that Lanier, rather than Harvard, should educate the public about the history of Renty and Delia.
“Ms. Lanier has always wanted to have those daguerreotypes to be used to educate the public on the evils of slavery,” Crump said. “What she has a problem with is that Harvard feels, because of their arrogance, that they’re in the best position to use the daguerreotypes.”
After the hearing, Lanier said in an interview that she was “over the moon excited” that the case will move forward.
“I was a little apprehensive going into the hearing, but the moment the judge started speaking, I just felt that he had really thoroughly reviewed the Supreme Court decision and that decision is a stinging indictment of Harvard,” Lanier said.
Joshua D. Koskoff, one of Lanier’s attorneys, said in an interview after the hearing that he is interested in collecting testimonies from former University President Drew G. Faust and current University President Lawrence S. Bacow about their justification for maintaining possession of the daguerreotypes and for their treatment of Lanier.
Peabody and Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson Rachael Dane wrote in an emailed statement that the University is “hopeful the Court’s ruling will allow Harvard to explore an appropriate home for the daguerreotypes” that makes them “more accessible to a broader segment of the public and to tell the stories of the enslaved people that they depict.”
The daguerreotypes were commissioned by Louis Agassiz, a Harvard biologist that researched polygenism — a pseudoscientific and racist field that maintains race determines genetic superiority.
Susanna M. Moore, a descendant of Agassiz, expressed her support for Lanier’s case and called on Harvard to return the daguerreotypes to Lanier in an interview after the hearing.
“It seems to me that in certain circumstances, moral authority needs to take the upper hand over technical issues with the law, and it’s about time for us to recognize what slavery meant in this country,” she said.
Lanier’s daughter Shonrael Lanier said in an interview after the hearing that the yearslong legal process has been “bittersweet” but is hopeful that the discovery and trial will allow the world to know Renty “for the man that he was and not for what the man that Harvard claims that he is or isn’t.”
“It’s been over 170 years in the making,” Koskoff said. “Finally, we’re going to get to tell this story to a jury.”

So you got accepted into Harvard but can’t make it to Visitas? You’ve got nothing to worry about! There are tons of amazing resources out there that will help you get a better idea of what life at Harvard looks like. Coming from someone whose first time on campus was quite literally her move-in day, here are a few things I found useful:
Following @flybyblog on Instagram, visit our wonderful webpage, subscribe to Harvard Today immediately. This is not even my usual Flyby propaganda. I genuinely did read up on blog articles as a prefrosh not only for amusement but also to get a feel for the school culture. Who wouldn’t want to go to school where the content that resonates most with the student population is either about midterms or being single and lonely? Just kidding! We are all really happy to be here.
Take a virtual tour of our wonderful campus. It truly will not matter whether you tour the school in-person or online because I promise you: everyone will be equally lost once they move in. Just remember, the Yard is grassless for the majority of the school year so take those pretty pictures with a little grain of salt ;(
Talk to current students. Not only is this an amazing way to make new friends, it is also undoubtedly the best way to get real insight into what life is like on campus. You can always DM someone on insta, too.
In the same vein, watch Harvard vlogs on YouTube, TikTok, etc. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the school if you don’t know any upperclassmen. Honestly speaking, Christine Lee ’23, who also happens to be a beloved member of Flyby, single-handedly made me excited for freshman year. Her YouTube channel is not only so aesthetic but it is such an amazing resource if you want to see what life at Harvard is like.
Check out the First-Year Experience website. This resource is probably best for logistical things like dorm life, programming, or campus resources, and you email them with any questions you may have.
Sit back and relax! You are going to learn everything you need to know about Harvard once you get to campus. So, take this time to relax, hang out with your hometown friends, and be proud of yourself for how far you've come.

Sure, Visitas is a great time to explore Harvard, but it’s definitely not the only resource available to you. Remember, you’ll have the next four years to experience the wonders and struggles of college life so don’t worry at all if you aren’t able to visit campus before move-in. I can’t wait to welcome all of you next semester — get hyped for college but also make sure to spend some time enjoying the rest of your senior year of high school!

You signed up to host for Visitas, but how can you be the best host on campus? How do you make your prefrosh love Harvard? How do you make them commit? Here are Flyby’s dos and don’ts to accomplish all of the above and more:
DON’T: Go MIA just when they arrive on campus.
It’s easy to forget, but Harvard is a very confusing and very easy-to-get-lost-in place when it’s your first day on campus. Asking a prefrosh to go from the Science Center to Weld might very well have them asking Google if there’s a metalworking space on campus. You might think your prefrosh can find your dorm without a hitch, but chances are that they’ll need someone to walk them to your room or, at the very least, very detailed text instructions.
DO: Coordinate with your guest before they get to campus.
Contact your guest as soon as you can to discuss any details about their stay. When do they plan to arrive? Where will you be the morning of their arrival? Do you plan to spend any time with them? What should they bring? Will there be other guests in your suite? Surprises are fun, but not so much when it’s your first time in a new place.
DON’T: “Forget” to throw out your trash for the third week in a row.
Pretty please clean your room. An overflowing trash can and an unvacuumed floor might be a truer depiction of college life than anything your suite will look like after it’s cleaned, but your prefrosh deserves another few months before being scarred by that image. Pre-Visitas is also the perfect time to spring clean pre-reading period and finals, so unleash those cleaning supplies and pretend that your prefrosh’s decision about Harvard is resting on whether or not your floors are gleaming.
DO: Plan to make your guest at home!
Your guest should bring a sleeping bag and/or a few blankets with them, but it doesn’t hurt to be prepared just in case. It’s likely that your guest will forget at least one item they’ll need during their stay, so put aside some extra blankets and chalk as well as some time in your schedule to take them by CVS for any forgotten toiletries. Also, be sure to decide where in your suite — on your floor? On the couch? — your prefrosh will be sleeping (as well as where their luggage will go) and plan accordingly. Planning ahead also has the bonus of helping you maintain the facade of a mature, totally entirely functional college student. (This bonus sadly does not apply if you know your guest personally.)
DON’T: Leave your guest high and dry.
It’s likely that your guest doesn’t know anyone else on campus, and many prefrosh travel alone for the first time for Visitas. Above all, your guest needs your support. You’re busy — your final paper due on Monday and a million for-prefrosh club events have made sure of that — but it’s their first time on campus, and you signed up to be there for them. You don’t have to babysit them, but make sure you’re still semi-available. Answer their questions. Set aside some time to spend with them. Be the host you would have wanted.
DO: Give them a personalized tour of Harvard.
Give them your unofficial (but totally, 100 percent better) tour of Harvard, complete with stops at your favorite study spot and the best BoardPlus location on campus. Take them places their Visitas IDs might not let them (within reason, though). Show them the parts of campus that make your experience unique; if you were matched as host and guest, it’s likely that you have at least a few things in common — your favorite parts of campus might well be their favorite parts in a few years’ time.
DON’T: Monopolize all their time.
This hardly needs to be said, but your guest visited campus to learn about Harvard, not become besties with you (unfortunately, because you’re amazing). Make sure your guest has the chance to meet other prefrosh and to participate in Visitas sans your influence. Weigh in where you can, but let them get their first true taste of independence, too.
DO: Help your guest make the most of their Visitas experience.
There are too many events on the calendar, too many places to be. If your prefrosh is unsure of where to go, help them out! Help them decide on a Visitas schedule that works well for them. Let them know that it’s okay to skip their 20th club event to hang out with other prefrosh. Help them discover the parts of Harvard that won’t show up on any schedule or map. Peer pressure them into committing. Be there for them when they’re confused or lost or distraught. The happier your guests are, the more satisfied you’ll be with yourself as a host.
No matter how your hosting experience turns out, we can guarantee that your prefrosh is so, so grateful that you’ve given up some of your space and your time to make them a place on campus. Try to be the best host you can, but don’t overthink it; as soon as your guest settles in on campus, the hard part is over. Good luck, and Happy Visitas!

Calling all prefrosh: Do you want to minimize the number of annoyed upperclassmen zooming past you on their way to lectures while muttering “It’s bring your kid to school day again” because you were blocking their way? Do you want to avoid embarrassing calls to your Visitas host begging them to pick you up because all the red-brick buildings look the same? Would you like to not miss that one cool mixer with free pizza because you ended up in Cabot House instead of Cabot Library? As a notoriously navigationally challenged person (let’s just say that my friends typically assign someone to walk with me to places), I am the perfect person to tackle this struggle.
Google Maps is a gift from the heavens and you should unapologetically embrace it
Reality check: I recognize that I alone will not suffice in making you swallow your pride and use this life-saving app. You want to prove to yourself that you were always meant to be here by using your “natural instincts” to find Sanders Theatre. But I’ll let you in on a little secret: You are destined to fail. I have been attending this college for almost nine months and I still pull out Google Maps to get to the Northwest Building or Eliot House. It took me almost two months to memorize the locations of the Yard’s lecture halls and even longer to figure out the paths to them from different campus spots. You are not getting it in three days, no matter how many years you spent as a boy scout. The Internet Gods have graced us with a digitally mapped college for a reason. Take advantage of it.
Make your host your designated guide
All Visitas hosts voluntarily signed up to have you live with them with absolutely no bribing by the college. They were definitely not promised more extra credit and food. Chances are, they’re excited about serving as your temporary Harvard guardians (I know I am), so give them the opportunity to showcase it. The scheduled tours, while entertaining and worthwhile, serve more as overviews of the history of Harvard than orientation tools. Ask your host for an unofficial tour if you happen to have overlapping free time. It will be more condensed, they can take the time to help you establish mental shortcuts for all the buildings, you will get a taste of the Harvard community, and you will learn some not-admissions-office-approved facts about the fun shenanigans that make Harvard a not-so-typical smart people college. (Ask about the foot.)
Don’t trust PassioGo to get to the Quad
By Quad we refer to the upperclassmen houses of Pforzheimer, Cabot, and Currier, located on the former residential campus of Radcliffe College, a 15-minute walk from the Yard (hence the Quad Discourse). There are always some self-proclaimed Visitas connoisseurs (who spent too much time memorizing the Harvard website) that will suggest taking a brief stroll to the Quad to “get the full Harvard experience.” Besides the apparent lack of reasons to do so, given that unless students are housed there, they only go for parties, it is a guaranteed recipe for disaster, thanks to the numerous small and confusing alleys of Cambridge. PassioGo is an app that allows you to track the available Quad shuttles, which theoretically makes the trip easier — but its dysfunctionality is so notorious that it has been immortalized in many Harvard Sidechat memes.
Seek the wisdom of the old and experienced
This one bears the best results within the Yard and requires a short crash course in “How to Spot a Harvard Student and Avoid Tourists 101.” Let’s say you have just found some potential targets and are ready to intercept. How can you be sure that they aren’t as confused as you are? Some features that lead to immediate disqualification are: wearing one of the Harvard Tour stickers, carrying professional cameras, and touching the foot of the John Harvard statue. You are looking for young adults whose eyes are 75 percent dead and 25 percent counting on being in Forbes’ 30 Under 30. Upperclassmen can seem intimidating, but they have been in your place and understand your stress, so don’t be afraid to walk up to them and politely ask for directions. I would advise you to stay away from those that seem to be running while muttering curses because they are probably already 10 minutes late to their math section and not happy about it.
Travel in groups
Misery loves company, and embarrassment is more tolerable when it is shared with others. Once you manage to make your first friends on campus, set a meeting spot from which you will walk together to all the events you are interested in attending. This will ensure that even if you accidentally find yourself next to the Charles River instead of Annenberg, the memory will be saved as a fun moment of solidarity and laughter, rather than a traumatizing event. Also, two brains work better than one and if each member of your group remembers the location of one major Yard building, you might just be able to escape the need for Google Maps after all.
Pray you don’t get Freshman-Quadded
If your assigned host lives in Greenough, Pennypacker, or Hurlbut, you should receive financial compensation for emotional damages. They are often labeled the “Freshman Quad” because they are the only first-year residential buildings outside of the Yard and make the daily life of unsuspecting newbies a mini Odyssey. Even my teachings may not be sufficient to save you. May the Crimson Gods be on your side. And I would stay away from the trashcan next to Barker Center during the daily stroll to the yard. (Perhaps I am being slightly overdramatic, they are only two blocks away from the main campus.)
Whether you decide to embrace your tourist-like appearance or choose to make the most of your disorientation by admiring the scenery, one thing is for sure: your Visitas experience will definitely elevate your survival skills. Armor yourself with a good sense of self-deprecating humor and channel your inner Dora the Explorer and you are guaranteed to have a good time. And remember: when in doubt, Google it!
