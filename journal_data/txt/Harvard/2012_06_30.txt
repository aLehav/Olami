After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite initiatives to centralize its workforce, the Harvard Library System will not be significantly reducing its approximately 930 person staff, according to an emailed announcement from Harvard University Library Executive Director Helen Shenton and Senior Associate Provost for the Harvard Library Mary Lee Kennedy.
“We are pleased to share that, due to the Voluntary Early Retirement Incentive Program and the Schools' careful management of vacancies, nearly all library staff members with roles designated as Harvard Library Shared Services or Support Services will have a position in the new Harvard Library organization,” Shenton and Kennedy wrote.
Shared Services consist of Access Services, Information and Technical Services and Preservation, Conservation and Digital Imaging Services, while Support Services consist of Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, Project Management and Communications, according to a university spokesperson.
Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers director Bill Jaeger said that the news was well-received by library workers, who were alarmed by University announcements in January warning there could be potential layoffs.
“Members of our union were really glad to see the tone of the announcement,” Jaeger said.  “A lot of people in our union are seeing this basically as a correction to the stark announcements that were made back in January.”
According to Jaeger, the announcement was received as a confirmation that there would be no mass layoffs.
“It looks to us as though some of the slightly more significant changes are going to be at the middle managerial level, where there might be somewhat fewer middle managers as some of the small and medium sized libraries work together differently and are arranged into clusters,” Jaeger said.
Shenton and Kennedy’s email also explained that new elements of the Library organization would be announced in the near future, noting that Shared Services or Support Services staff members would soon be contacted with information about changes to their occupation.
Jaeger said that the HUCTW was not currently concerned about how this would be handled.
“At this point, it doesn’t feel like we’re going to have our members forced involuntarily into job changes that would cause them problems or that do not interest them.  It seems like a lot’s going to be done by working it out voluntarily,” Jaeger said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard presented Samuels & Associates, Harvard’s real estate partner for the Barry’s Corner Retail and Housing Commons project, to Allston residents Wednesday. The presentation, made during a Harvard-Allston Task Force meeting, reflected further progress on the part of the University as it resumes its development in the neighborhood.
Joel Sklar and Leslie Cohen represented Samuels & Associates on Wednesday night, telling residents that their company is dedicated to fulfilling the needs of the community, creating a more vibrant street-level, and respecting the existing neighborhood.
Cohen said that in the Barry’s Corner project, like in all Samuels and Associates’ mixed-use projects, they will “start from the streetscape and build up.”
“We will look at the uses that we need to activate the street, to activate the community,” said Cohen.   She said that they will look to weave Barry’s Corner Retail and Housing Commons into the fabric of the community.
Barry’s Corner is one leg of Harvard’s plan to create an academic hub in North Allston, which includes the construction of a state-of-the-art science research facility. Harvard officials have said that the University hopes the Commons, comprised of apartments and retail businesses, will bring Harvard closer to realizing its goal of transforming Western Ave.—the street on which the Commons and science center will sit—into a “main street” environment.
Harvard resumed planning in late 2011, nearly two years after University President Drew G. Faust halted construction due to financial constraints caused by the 2008 economic recession. Harvard announced earlier this month that it plans to resume construction in 2014.
During the presentation, Cohen and Sklar described Samuels & Associates’ work on three other relevant building projects—The Fenway Triangle, The Mecca at Grove Hall, and The Launch at Hingham Shipyard.
The presentation detailed feedback and requests on potential development from Allston residents, such as “create a mix of unit types and sizes,” and “establish connections between the grove of trees and Smith Field.”
“We are really taking our cues from the BRA work session with the task force and really from the feedback we are getting here we are going go back and role up our sleeves and get to work and come back with some ideas,” said Cohen.
Cohen and Sklar concluded the presentation by emphasizing their willingness to listen to the community’s opinions of the Barry’s Corner complex.
Task Force member and resident Brent C. Whelan ’73 said that despite some concerns about the nature of the project, he found Samuels & Associates "to be genuinely interested in talking to the community about their plans.”
Whelan said that he thinks the mixed used housing project planned for Barry’s Corner is “relatively high end," a result of a project which, Whelan believes, is driven by profit.
“Their idea of the public is narrow,” Whelan said of references to the “public” in the presentation.  He said that the "public" should be defined as the community as a whole rather than simply the residents in the new mixed-use housing.
The proposal for mixed-use housing at Barry’s Corner would allow members of the general public to rent units at market rate.
Harry E. Mattison, a Task Force member and Allston resident, also raised concern that mixed-use housing would segregate the community by including facilities that would not available to other Allston Residents.
“It sounded like a gated community with private, resident-only services” he said.
At the meeting’s end, Kevin Casey, Harvard's associate vice president for public affairs and communications, also discussed two possible relocation options for tenants that currently work at 219 Western Avenue including a Harvard Ceramics Program.  No final decisions have been made.
Casey said that relocating the program would make way for the Commons’ new mixed-use housing and enhance the “pedestrian environment” of Barry’s Corner.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Harvard forward Andrew Van Nest ’12 will be playing for the Boston College Eagles next season as a graduate student fulfilling his last season of eligibility. The 6’10”, 230-pound forward was part of a senior class, along with former co-captains Keith Wright ’12 and Oliver McNally ’12, which oversaw the transition of the Crimson basketball program from traditional doormat to Ivy League champion under the tutelage of Harvard coach Tommy Amaker.
Coming into his freshman season, Van Nest was the highest ranked member of the Class of 2012 to matriculate to Harvard. During his senior season at the prestigious basketball prep school Northfield Mount Herman, high school home to current Crimson standouts Laurent Rivard and Matt Brown, Van Nest received offers from Davidson, Northwestern, and Penn, and was considered by many to be a steal for Amaker and his coaching staff.
Shoulder surgery derailed his freshman season, as Van Nest missed every game, and despite his recovery, Van Nest never regained his previous form and struggled with injuries the remainder of his career.
Van Nest only saw action in one game his senior season, in a win against his new teammates at Boston College on Dec. 29, 2011. Under Harvard and the Ivy League’s eligibility rules, Van Nest would have been required to take a year off of school in order to return and play for the Crimson next season. Though rare, fifth-year seniors such as quarterback Collier Winters ’11 and Ivy League Defensive Player of the Year defensive lineman Josue Ortiz ’11 have seen success in the recent past.
Instead, Van Nest remained in school and graduated in May. Under NCAA eligibility regulations, his freshman season counted as a redshirt leaving him with an extra year of eligibility which he will fulfill with the Eagles in the 2012-13 season while pursuing a graduate degree.
Boston College is looking for a turnaround season after going 9-22, and 4-12 in the ACC, last season.
