After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few days ago, as I was organizing my bookshelf, I came across a book that I read in my freshman year, a work which many Harvard students read at some point during their four years here: Friedrich Nietzsche’s “On the Genealogy of Morality.” Seeing the book reminded me of the discussion that seems constantly to permeate today’s political discourse, including conversations among many students at Harvard—the question of how we, as members of contemporary society, should remember the historical figures of our past, especially when individuals hold perspectives that appall us today.
As I flipped through the pages of Nietzsche’s book, I couldn’t help but be struck by the same dilemma when considering the awesome complexity of Nietzsche the philosopher.
In this particular work, Nietzsche puts forth his view that our existing system of morality obscures the true and natural instincts of human beings in favor of a “slave morality,” where self-denial of human desires has become the basis for both religious piety and our conception of goodness. In short, the work invites us to ask ourselves how humanity developed moral values that emphasize restraint rather than the satisfaction of our instinctual pleasures. This central thesis is brilliant and prompted me to think deeply as few other works have done. In reading it, I could see clearly why it’s taught in so many introductory classes at Harvard alone.
Yet, as captivating as Nietzsche is in his insights about the fundamental questions of human nature, he is equally frightening in his blatant prejudice, ranging from his polemics against the Jews to his tirades against the Chinese. The complexity lies in the fact that the same thinker whose analysis of morality is so profound could simultaneously hold such revolting views. Yet, philosophy and humanities and social science departments from across the country continue to teach his work. And they should. To throw him out because of his mistakes would prevent students and scholars from experiencing him at his finest. It would disregard the enormous good that his writing has accomplished in advancing philosophy, and the value that he has added to our society.
When judged alongside other historical figures, Nietzsche turns out to be the rule rather than the exception. This is important to note, especially as our society considers reevaluating people from the past. Almost every individual from a previous era held views that would be considered unacceptable now; if our litmus test for honoring historical figures included the criteria that they must have been as tolerant and open-minded as Americans today, few, if any, of the greatest change makers in history would be spared.
For one, George Washington, the father of our country, would certainly be toppled from his perch on Mount Rushmore for having owned slaves; so too would Abraham Lincoln, who famously said as President that if he “could save the Union without freeing any slave [he] would do it” — that he would not object to keeping human beings enslaved if this was required for a reunited nation. Not to mention FDR, who — even after helping to lead America through the Great Depression and the Second World War — can still be considered immoral for his internment of 100,000 Japanese Americans without due process. Even Martin Luther King Jr., one of the greatest champions of civil rights, wrote that being gay was “a problem” that required the attention of “a good psychiatrist”; his views of BGLTQ identities were questionable, at best, by today’s standards.
If we are sanctimonious enough, the monuments to Washington, Lincoln, FDR, and MLK can be disqualified from having a place of honor in our society. So too can the great people of our time (whose defining actions and movements have yet to come), as our descendants look back on us. As students at Harvard, we may think that our views are morally and ethically sound — the best that they can be. Yet, as difficult as it is for us to imagine, we can be assured that future eras will inevitably find faults with our thinking and see us as appalling in some way.
Where we draw this line in our generation will determine whether we continue to commemorate those who deserve the recognition. And certainly, Washington and MLK should continue to be honored for their work in forming a more perfect union. As scholars who understand the complex nature of human minds—and the differences in the views of various eras—we must err increasingly on the side of caution as we evaluate the figures of our past.
We should first remember the good that they have done and undertake the careful balancing act that a rigorous study of history necessitates; the fairness of our evaluation will depend entirely on our ability to accept that many individuals whose views were objectionable to modern society still contributed in great measure to it—that these figures, although deeply flawed, built and saved our republic, and in some way, laid the groundwork for the country that we have today.
On that note, I think it’s fair to say that Nietzsche has done us a great service. For, if nothing else, he provides us with a prime example of the duality inherent in even the most brilliant people and reminds us that our greatest fallacy is to think, somehow, that we are perfect.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I used to love introducing myself and having conversations with new people. I would talk about how my mom randomly decided to name me after a professional volleyball player, even though she had never really watched or played volleyball. I would tell them about my home in a tiny village on a small island in the middle of the South Pacific. And I would share with them my love for basketball or the reasons why green is the best color in the world.
But after my first couple of weeks at Harvard, I quickly learned that no one cared.
I soon learned that I needed to re-work my introductions so as not to bore people to sleep. No longer did I mention fun facts about the origins of my name or about the island I was born and raised in. And, no longer did I reveal my favorite sport or my favorite color. Instead, my introductions were redesigned to include the number of times I represented my island at national academic competitions. I refrained from passionately explaining my reasons for joining particular clubs on campus and instead spoke about the amount of work I was doing in these clubs, because that’s what people were more interested in hearing. And so, I learned that the trick to making friends at Harvard was not to friendly introduce myself. It was to establish my power and my intellect.
At Harvard, the most important thing that we are taught is how to expand our social networks for personal gain. The importance of networking is drilled into us through different academic advising sessions and even through conversations with upperclassmen, who swear it is the only way to move up the ladder in life. On top of this, the Office of Career Services has a whole webpage dedicated to advising students on how to “make connections,” defining networking as “nothing more than talking with people who can provide you with information, advice, resources, and possible contacts related to your fields of interest.”
But this creates a culture of transactional relationships and absurd standards. Relationships that are only pursued if there is a potential, mutual benefit. Standards of achievement that a person needs to meet before earning the friendship of others. And it is all because we are taught not to listen or care about the quirky, little things that make people who they are. Rather, we are trained to assess a person based on the potential “resources” that they may have to offer in the future.
In this way, truly genuine relationships are not formed. With this pressure of assessment, I’ve felt forced to prove myself to people I do not yet know. Rather than introducing myself anymore, I introduce my achievements and potential for success by listing past accomplishments or talking excessively about my big plans for the summer. It is almost like I am a college applicant again, but this time my peers are the admissions officers and I am desperately waiting on an acceptance letter into their friendships.
So, I don’t talk about my favorite foods or try to start the debate about who the best Avenger is. I don’t mention funny childhood memories or share my deep, personal secrets with others. Instead, my conversations with people are a monotonous reciprocation of complaints about the amount of problem sets, papers, and extracurricular work that have yet to be completed or the little amount of sleep that is achieved on a daily basis.
When asked about my day or my well-being, rather than recount a funny joke that my TF told in section or confess how much Skyping my family made me miss home, I spit out this rehearsed mantra of all the work I have to do and all the deadlines I have to meet, as if to subtly prove my capabilities and my work ethic. And so, I keep a mask on — a mask that veils who I really am, because I don’t think anyone really cares to know. Even worse is the expectation that I am not to venture behind other people’s mask, but rather judge them based on the attractiveness of the mask that they present.
If this is the case, how can we really be sure that the people we call our “friends” truly care for us? We need to stop promoting social networking in the interests of materialistic personal gain, and instead start taking the time to genuinely listen and understand each other. Rather than trying to figure out if that big summer internship pulled through, why don’t we stop to genuinely ask others how their day was or ask how they’re doing? Because at the end of the day, everyone wants to finally rip off their uncomfortable mask and know that someone actually cares.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May 2016, then-University President Drew G. Faust announced extensive new penalties intended to discourage students from the classes of 2021 and beyond from joining unrecognized single-gender social organizations. These social groups were given the option to either remain single-gender or alter their membership policies to accept students of all genders.
The sanctions began to take effect with sorority and fraternity rush this past academic year, with sororities in particular reporting far lower pledge numbers than recent years. In response to the sanctions, all-female final clubs and sororities have either changed their membership policies to align with the College’s goals or disbanded. The Crimson reported on August 24 that there are to be no more all-female social groups at Harvard.
Although the sanctions policy applies equally to all-male and all-female groups, conversations surrounding the sanctions unambiguously focused on all-male social groups. In a University-wide report published in 2016, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana justified the report’s ultimate recommendation to sanction club members by stating that the male final clubs “propagate exclusionary values that undermine those of the larger Harvard College community” and that the most “entrenched” final clubs “send an unambiguous message that they are the exclusive preserves of men.”
And entrenched they are. Out of all the all-male final clubs, none were founded in the last 100 years. By contrast, all-female social groups on campus only formed in the 1990s and early 2000s. This has led to a large disparity in access to financial and alumni resources between all-male and all-female groups.
The most obvious example of this imbalance lies in the physical spaces owned by the clubs. While most of the all-male groups own clubhouses worth millions, none of the now transitioning all-female groups possess nearly as much property or commensurate financial resources.
To this point, a number of all-male social groups — including the Porcellian Club, A.D. Club, and Fly Club — are lobbying Congress to force Harvard to remove the sanctions — an initiative that has likely cost tens of thousands of dollars this year alone.
As a result of these disparities, the all-male social groups have a much larger alumni base and correspondingly far more resources to fight the sanctions. Unsurprisingly then, the final sanctions have not impacted these male final clubs to nearly the same degree as their female counterparts.
While members of the class of 2021 may be dissuaded from joining these clubs due to the sanctions, it remains unclear how the College will apply the sanctions — even after the announcement of a new implementation policy last spring — and adjudicate whether or not an individual has actually joined an unrecognized single-gender social organization.
The onus to change Harvard’s social scene remains, as of now, on the final clubs themselves. Many of these groups have been stalwart in their commitment to being all-male.
We have opined in favor of the sanctions, but noted that because all-female social groups counter the hostile environment inherent in a male-dominated social scene, they should be treated differently. We recognize the importance of female spaces on campus and encourage the University to do its best to support the formerly female clubs as they transition toward being recognized student groups. We also believe the University administration needs to answer for the results of the policy it enacted.
In light of these recent shifts in Harvard’s social scene, we would ask Dean Khurana: Do you believe that the sanctions have had their desired effect? Is Harvard better off now that women’s spaces are gone, while male clubs remain?
We commend the goal of creating an inclusive social environment at Harvard, but question whether the sanctions have attained it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s brand-new graduate student union is wading into state politics to advocate for a sexual assault prevention law currently under consideration by the Massachusetts state legislature.
In late July, the union’s Time’s Up Committee — a sexual harassment-focused advocacy group — organized a phone bank to make their case to legislators, who may vote on the bill either this fall or next year.
The union committee, established by Harvard Graduate Students-United Automobile Workers in May 2018, held the three-day phone bank in support of Bill H.4810, the third version of that legislation that has circulated since 2016. If Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 signs it into law, the bill would mandate that Harvard and other academic institutions undertake campus-wide climate surveys on issues of sexual harassment and assault every other year.
In addition to setting up phone bank stations on-campus, HGSU-UAW also distributed a script to union members off-campus.
Though the phone bank is the union’s first large-scale advocacy effort since the University recognized HGSU-UAW after a precedent-setting vote in May, union members previously delved into political activism in the run-up to the Nov. 2016 unionization election. After President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban affecting certain Muslim-majority countries prevented several Harvard affiliates from entering the United States in Jan. 2017, union members called for the creation of a hotline that would offer advice to students affected by the policy.
Union spokesperson Ege Yumusak ’16, a Philosophy Ph.D. candidate, wrote in an email that the union’s new recognition and partnership with the United Automobile Workers has provided “a platform for international representation” that has bolstered advocacy efforts.
“As organizers within this larger framework, we participate in the fight to end sexual violence in any way we can using the representative power of unions in addition to our collective bargaining power here at Harvard,” Yumusak wrote.
The Facebook event announcing the phone bank noted that Harvard last conducted a campus-wide climate survey in 2015. That survey found that 31 percent of senior undergraduate women at the College had experienced some form of sexual assault at Harvard, prompting then-University President Drew G. Faust to dub the survey results “deeply disturbing” in an email to students, faculty, and other Harvard affiliates.
The 2015 survey formed the basis for recommendations a University-wide task force on sexual assault prevention released roughlya year later. Among other measures, the task force recommended that Harvard administrators conduct surveys “at regular intervals to measure and inform ourselves about how well the University and the Schools are accomplishing our goals.”
Harvard has since implemented a number of the group’s proposals. But it has yet to conduct another climate survey.
John B. Gabrieli ’16, who worked with State Rep. Lori A. Erlich to develop the bill, said the legislation was originally meant to address concerns that public data about sexual assault on college campuses is inaccurate due to underreporting. The organization Gabrieli co-founded, Every Voice Coalition, has been advocating for campus climate survey legislation in various forms for four years.
“The only sexual assaults that have to be reported publicly are sexual assaults that happen publicly and are reported to police,” Gabrieli said, speaking generally about universities. “Even if it’s reported to the university, and even if the university finds the perpetrator guilty, that still doesn’t have to be reported publicly.”
“Almost all the students that we talked to themselves knew friends, family members, and people on their college campuses had been affected and felt that the public data was dramatically underreported and silencing their experience, or misrepresenting it,” he added.
While Harvard does not release information about the outcomes of individual sexual assault cases, the University’s central Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution do publish reports that aggregate anonymized statistics about sexual assault each year. Harvard saw an uptick in reported instances of sexual harassment during the 2016-2017 academic year, according to the most recent published data.
In addition to mandating that Harvard and other academic institutions conduct regular surveys, the bill also requires that survey data be made public. In a July press release, Erlich said publicizing results more frequently will allow lawmakers and students to better assess the frequency of sexual harassment at colleges and universities around the state.
“We know that something must be done, and to do so we must start by understanding the fullextent of the problem not only on one campus, but on every campus across Massachusetts,”Ehrlich said.
The campus climate bill has garnered support from other Harvard student organizations in addition to the union. In April, eight Harvard groups — including the Harvard College Democrats, the Harvard Republican Club, and anti-sexual assault advocacy group Our Harvard Can Do Better — endorsed a rally for an earlier version of the bill. Representatives from MIT, Boston University, and other area colleges also attended that demonstration in Boston.
Though distinct versions of the resolution passed both the state House and Senate, both bodies must reconcile the differences and approve the bill’s final form before they send it to the governor’s desk. Gabrieli said that, if the legislature does not pass the bill this fall, Every Voice Coalition will work to reintroduce it in the 2019 legislative session.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Janet Yellen on Thursday lent her support to Harvard and its race-conscious admissions policies as the lawsuit alleging the College discriminates against Asian American applicants inches ever closer to a high-profile and high-stakes trial.
Yellen, the first woman to serve at the helm of the Federal Reserve, joined a group of 17 other expert economists in filing an amicus brief that defended Harvard's use of race in its admissions process. The brief — whose signatories include two Nobel laureates, former chief economists of federal agencies, and a number of university professors — advocates for the soundness of Harvard’s statistical analysis of its admissions data.
That analysis, conducted by University of California at Berkeley professor David E. Card and submitted as part of the lawsuit, concluded Harvard does not discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
Students for Fair Admissions, the anti-affirmative action advocacy group that is suing Harvard for its admissions policies, previously criticized Card's analysis in court filings. SFFA conducted its own statistical analysis of the admissions data and came to the opposite conclusion.
Yellen and the gaggle of economists wrote in their brief that “[Card’s] statistical analyses in this case were methodologically sound, and that the criticisms of his modeling approach... are not based on sound statistical principles or practices.”
Experts say the lawsuit could come before the Supreme Court and decide the fate of affirmative action in the United States. Across the past several months, supporters and opponents of the University have filed scores of amicus briefs arguing both sides of the issue.
Higher education is so far siding with Harvard. Dozens of College student groups filed briefs in support of the University in late August, as did 16 top American universities in late July.
The federal government, however, is taking the opposite tack. The Department of Justice made its partiality for SFFA clear late last month by asserting in a scathing "statement of interest" that Harvard's admissions office perpetrates “unlawful racial discrimination."
Since SFFA first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, the University has repeatedly denied that it discriminates against Asian-American applicants.
“Harvard does not discriminate against applicants from any group, and will continue to vigorously defend the legal right of every college and university to consider race as one factor among many in college admissions, which the Supreme Court has consistently upheld for more than 40 years,” University spokesperson Anna G. Cowenhoven wrote in a statement.
The suit is slated to go to trial in a Boston courthouse on Oct. 15.

The New York University School of Medicine generated national headlines and some glowing editorials when it announced over the summer that it planned to go tuition-free.
Harvard, though, has no plans to follow suit.
NYU's School of Medicine recently decided to grant full-tuition scholarships to all M.D. students without attention to their level of financial need or academic merit. The scholarships do not include the roughly $29,000 in room, board, and living expenses that NYU estimates students will still need to pay each year.
The move came after the school raised $450 million of the $600 million they needed to completely cover tuition — $100 million of which came from Kenneth G. Langone, the founder of Home Depot.
Harvard Medical School Dean George Q. Daley ’82 wrote a letter to students this month reviewing Harvard’s current scholarships for its medical students. He criticized the approaches of other schools but did not mention NYU by name.
"Some schools have abandoned the principle of need-based scholarship support and are diverting aid from students in need to students with ample means to pay for their education, often those who already enjoy considerable socioeconomic advantages," he wrote.
He also mentioned that Harvard Medical School graduates have the third-lowest level of student debt of all American medical schools, hovering at $105,389.
Edward Hundert, Harvard’s dean for medical education, said Harvard’s financial-aid programs attempt to provide more need-based aid, rather than merit aid or scholarships that do not factor in financial need.
“What we're trying to do is make sure that, as we allocate our scholarship funds, that we do it based on the calculated ability to pay of people who apply, so that we don't get into the possibility that a students from a family of considerable means is getting more of our aid relative to a student of more limited means,” he said.
Under Harvard Medical School’s current tuition scheme, all students receive a scholarship that is equal to their financial need as determined by federal formulas — minus $33,950, the school’s “unit loan” that it expects all students to take out annually.
Asked whether he is worried prospective students will now choose NYU over Harvard for financial reasons, Hundert said he thinks students will make that decision based on which school would be the best fit for them.
“We believe that students should try to select whichever learning environment suits them the best,” he said. “I really feel strongly that students should try to find that best learning environment for them.”
Julie Fresne, a senior administrator at the Association of American Medical Colleges, wrote in an email that she would like to see more schools go tuition-free but that it might be financially difficult for many institutions.
“We believe many schools would like to be able to offer such a generous program. However, it takes tremendous support and commitment, not to mention very generous donors, which isn't realistic for all schools,” she wrote.
Harvard Medical School has confronted financial difficulties for the past several years. The school has seen an operating deficit nine out of the last 10 years. The deficit stood at $44 million during the most recent fiscal year.
Correction: Sept. 7, 2018
A previous version of this article misquoted Edward Hundert. It has been updated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Division of Continuing Education has added two new fields of study, a joint bachelor’s and master’s degree program, and several new master’s capstone tracks.
The two new fields of study, Development Practice and Data Science, bring the number of Extension School graduate offerings to 23 areas of study.
“The field of data science has become incredibly important, incredibly hot,” said Henry H. Leitner, associate dean of the Information Technology master's program at DCE and a senior lecturer in Computer Science.
Leitner said data science courses have been offered at the Extension School for around four years now, but that the discipline's surging popularity pushed it towards the status of an official field of study.
Harvard introduced a version of Computer Science 109A: “Data Science 1: Introduction to Data Science,” the undergraduate data science course offered by the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, at the Extension School several years ago. Though not an introductory course, it reached its 90-student cap every year — and sometimes within a day of online registration opening, according to Leitner.
“It’s increasingly important for companies to hire people who specialize in this niche. Everyone wants to be in on this, every company wants people like this,” said Scott Gorlin, who teaches a new advanced Python for data science course required of all data science degree candidates at DCE.
Though data science has been gaining traction for a while, development practice — which addresses larger global challenges in sustainable development such as climate change and access to clean water — is still a relatively new field of study at the school.
“There’s been a major shift in the field of sustainability at large,” said Thomas P. Gloria, director of the graduate sustainability and environmental management program at DCE.
“To continue to innovate and update our curriculum, we’re now offering this updated development practice field of study to keep current and make our graduates successful within the field of sustainability,” Gloria added.
Students have demonstrated high levels of interest in both development practice and data science courses this year. Around 40 students are enrolled in, but not yet admitted to, the development practice field of study, Gloria said. Two students have transferred from the more general sustainability offering to development practice, according to Gloria.
Though students will not be admitted to the data science field of study until they successfully complete two prerequisite courses, Leitner estimates around 80 people will be formally enrolled by the end of this academic year.
Rodrigo Vargas, a first-year DCE student who works at an asset management firm, said he looks forward to the chance to take more data science courses.
“My job, I think it requires deep knowledge of [data science],” Vargas said. “Improve my skills in real-world scenarios, learn different techniques, models, and how to approach problems — that’s what I’m looking for.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When former University President Drew G. Faust formed a committee to "review" the forcible arrest of a black Harvard student last spring and undertake a "systematic examination" of school policies, she declared the group must proceed with "special urgency."
The committee should "work intensively" to complete and deliver recommendations to her successor, Lawrence S. Bacow, before the start of the fall semester, Faust said.
That hasn't happened.
Instead, the committee announced Thursday that it plans to conduct further "focus groups" with students before offering suggestions to Bacow.
Law School professor Annette Gordon-Reed, the committee chair, wrote in a letter to Bacow Thursday that — since its formation in April — the committee has collected information and reviewed feedback from University affiliates regarding the arrest, which roiled campus, drew national headlines, and sparked allegations of police brutality. But Gordon-Reed wrote the group is not yet ready to conclude its work and will instead offer final guidance later this fall.
Katherine G. O’Dair, the College’s dean of students, emailed undergraduates Thursday to invite them to apply to serve on the focus groups, which will be capped at 15 participants each. Gordon-Reed wrote that the committee is forming the groups in order to “ensure broad levels of student engagement” in the review process.
“While the outreach we conducted over the summer was helpful, we feel strongly that we need much more input than we were able to obtain while students were away from campus,” Gordon-Reed wrote.
Cambridge Police Department officers forcibly arrested a black undergraduate on April 13 — the night of the College’s annual spring concert — after responding to calls about a naked man standing on Massachusetts Avenue. In the physical altercation that followed, officers tackled the student to the ground before arresting the undergraduate, who was likely under the influence of narcotics, on charges including indecent exposure, disorderly conduct, assault, and resisting arrest.
A later CPD police report states the student clenched his fists and began making aggressive moves toward the officers, spurring them to tackle him. But eyewitnesses stated that CPD’s version of events was incorrect and that the officers acted “without provocation.”
A video of the incident later published by CPD shows the student standing still, surrounded by four officers, while the officers briefly speak to him. The student turns around and takes two steps towards one officer before taking a step back and raising his arms to chest-level. Another officer then tackles the student from behind.
While the student remained on the ground, at least one CPD officer punched the undergraduate in the stomach five times in an “ineffective” attempt to unpin the student’s arms and handcuff him, according to the CPD police report.
The arrest spurred widespread condemnation of CPD’s actions, as well as the actions of other University departments meant to assist students in crisis.
Hours after the arrest, the Harvard Black Law Students Association released a statement calling the incident an example of “police brutality.” In the days following, a group of undergraduates formed a new advocacy group called Black Students Organizing for Change. The group held a protest in Harvard Yard and circulated a letter criticizing Harvard administrators for not speaking out against the arrest.
Faust created the review committee shortly thereafter.
Gordon-Reed wrote Thursday that the committee unearthed several “themes” in the feedback it collected, including misunderstandings regarding what students expect from emergency response services and concern over “dangerous drinking” at the spring concert.
Hilda M. Jordan ’19, a leader of BSOC, wrote in an emailed statement, that, while she is sympathetic to the committee’s desire to gather more student input, she had expected the committee to complete its work within Faust’s original timeline.
“As a student I am concerned with the inability of Harvard's committee and administration, both past and present, to keep its word and ensure that students on this campus feel safe and heard,” Jordan wrote.
Harvard spokesperson Aaron M. Goldman declined to comment on the committee’s work, pointing instead to Gordon-Reed’s letter to Bacow.
Though the meeting times and details of the focus groups have not been announced, Gordon-Reed wrote in the letter that the committee looks forward to presenting the recommendations to Bacow “in the coming weeks."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School Dean John F. Manning ’82 has approved several changes to the school’s Low Income Protection Plan, a program that helps HLS graduates who work in low-paying legal careers pay back their student loans.
The enhancements — approved last month — include expansions to certain leaves or periods of unemployment, increases in dependent care allowance and childcare expenses, and a rise in the LIPP Participant Contribution Scale, which determines how much LIPP participants pay towards their student loans according to their incomes.
“The LIPP enhancements were the result of many people working together to make reasonable and sustainable changes,” Kenneth Lafler, the Law School's assistant dean for student financial services, wrote in an email. “The proposals ultimately suggested by the Coalition to Improve LIPP were themselves the result of a process of refinement through numerous meetings with the staff of Student Financial Services.”
Lafler also wrote that a survey designed by the Law School's Student Financial Services helped inform the alterations. The survey garnered input from almost 2,000 alumni, according to Lafler.
The Coalition to Improve LIPP, a group formed last year by Law students, released a series of proposed changes to the program in early 2018. Many of the enhancements Manning approved are almost identical to the changes the coalition suggested. In one example, the overall transition time between jobs during which LIPP participants may still receive assistance tripled from eight to 24 weeks.
Participants will initially receive 12 weeks of transition time — a change the coalition suggested. LIPP graduates can earn an additional 12 weeks as they enter their fifth year of the program, which slightly differs from the coalition’s proposal to allot an additional two weeks of transition time per every six months that a participant remains involved with the initiative.
Rachel Sandalow-Ash ’15, a second-year Law student and president of the coalition, said the changes form “an important first step” to improving the LIPP program.
“It’s clear that the Financial Aid Committee and Dean Manning did really listen to and consider the proposals that the Coalition to Improve LIPP, along with the 38 student groups that supported these proposals, brought to their attention and that they implemented things that are really going to help people,” Sandalow-Ash said.
She said the group is excited about the expanded transition time, as well as increases in the dependent care allowance and childcare expenses.
“We think this is a welcome recognition of the fact that childcare is really expensive and constantly becoming more expensive, and we very much hope that this change will enable more LIPP participants to be able to have families if that’s something they want to do,” she said.
The increase in dependent care allowance allows for $8,000 per child, up from $6,000 for the first child and $3,600 for each additional child. This matches the proposal put forward by the coalition.
The allowance for child care expenses increased “to cover actual documented child care expenses of up to $20,000 per child, from the current allowance of 10% of total family income per child,” though “the existing 10% allowance per child will still apply” for LIPP participants who have a family income over $200,000.
Still, Sandalow-Ash said there is more to be done. She specifically criticized the changes to the payment contribution scale.
“The changes in the participant contribution scale barely accounts for inflation, if at all, so we’ll definitely be urging the administration to take action on that — to lower the student debt burden facing graduates every month,” Sandalow-Ash said.
In response to criticism regarding the contribution scale, Lafler wrote that the Law School has increased benefits by 15 percent every year and that “thoughtful planning and budgeting” goes towards ensuring that LIPP “remains strong.”
“Many other law schools have been forced to significantly reduce their loan repayment assistance benefits over the past several years,” Lafler wrote. “We do not ever want to be in this position at HLS, which is why we must make sure that changes to LIPP are carefully considered and measured so that HLS can continue to provide the same benefits to all graduates of the J.D. program.”
Correction: Sept. 7, 2018
A previous version of this article misstated the increase in dependent care allowance and incorrectly indicated that the increase did not exactly match a proposal put forward by the Coalition to Improve LIPP. It has been updated.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Kennedy School's fall Institute of Politics fellows took the stage at the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Thursday to offer a shared conviction — that, under the Trump administration, America has strayed into a political Twilight Zone.
“You might be lulled into thinking this is normal,” said Mitch Landrieu, the former mayor of New Orleans. “This is not normal. In 30 years, I’ve served in office. My dad served in office. I’ve never experienced anything quite like this.”
“Whatever side of whatever argument you are on, this is not a normal period,” said Washington Post chief correspondent and new senior fellow Dan Balz. “We don’t know where it’s ending. We don’t know where it’s going.”
Thursday's panel, moderated by IOP Director Mark D. Gearan ’78, was meant to address the current “moment in time." Speakers discussed Senator John McCain’s high-profile funeral, to which the president was not invited, and the anonymous opinion piece criticizing Trump penned by a senior White House official and published by the New York Times this week.
Many fellows were quick to call these developments “extraordinary.” They also offered blunt critiques of the current administration and Congress.
Margaret Talev, a senior White House reporter for Bloomberg News, stressed that explosive reports about the administration will “come to head during the midterm elections.” 
“The definitions of the Republican party is at stake, control of Congress is at stake, the direction of the second half of the term of the president is at stake and Democrats are trying to figure out who is going to run in 2020. That is at stake. The control of the Supreme Court is at stake,” Talev said.
Fellows also emphasized the importance of civic engagement in the run-up to the November midterm races and encouraged students seated in the audience to register to vote.
“I’m optimistic because I will always believe in America,” Landrieu said. “There’s lots of ways for citizens to participate, but you have to engage because democracy does not survive alone.”
Kennedy School student Tyra J. Walker said conversations about the upcoming elections are important “at this critical time” in the country’s history.
“Like a lot of the fellows mentioned, we are on the eve of probably one of the most important elections a lot of us will witness in our young adult lives — that’s whether we’re undergraduate students or Kennedy School students or students at any of the other graduate schools here,” Walker said. “I think these conversations are the ones we need to keep having.”

An 80-year old woman died this afternoon after being struck by a vehicle in an apparent hit-and-run in a parking lot, spurring the Cambridge Police Department to spend hours seeking the driver responsible.
CPD identified a suspect in the death late Thursday night: Ashley Monturio, 41, of Pembroke, Mass. At the time of the incident, Monturio was driving a white Infiniti QX 60 SUV, according to police.
Officers found the victim, Romelia Gallardo, in the parking lot of the Cambridge Housing Authority building in Cambridgeport around midday Thursday. Police said Gallardo appeared to have been using a walker when she was struck. Police transported her to CHA Cambridge Hospital, where she was officially pronounced dead.
According to local police, Monturio fled the scene following the crash. Middlesex County District Attorney Marian T. Ryan and CPD Commissioner Branville G. Bard Jr. said Monturio has been arrested and charged with leaving the scene of an accident causing death.
CPD will continue investigating the incident will continue in conjunction with the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office and the Massachusetts State Police.
“It’s a tragic incident and our deepest condolences go out to the victim, her family and friends in the LBJ Housing community,” Cambridge Police Department spokesperson Jeremy Warnick wrote in an emailed statement.
The L. B. Johnson Apartments, located adjacent to the scene of the crime, is an apartment complex that offers public housing to elderly and disabled individuals. The building is owned and managed by the Massachusetts Public Housing Authority.
Late Thursday afternoon the scene of the accident was empty save for a few cars left in the parking lot and a number of local television news vans. A light drizzle fell.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Black Law Students Association announced Thursday afternoon that it is neutral regarding the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court after a letter from some group members praising the judge drew notice during his confirmation hearing Wednesday.
The letter, addressed to Senators Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chair and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, respectively, praised Kavanaugh for his work with Harvard BLSA.
Eight current and former BLSA members — seven of whom graduated from the Law School last year — signed the letter, which referred to an event where Kavanaugh “encouraged” and “mentored” BLSA members.
The statement from Harvard BLSA Thursday clarified that the group has neither endorsed nor condemned his nomination.
“Kavanaugh openly discussed how he supported BLSA, referencing an event during which he ‘encouraged’ and ‘mentored’ BLSA members to apply for clerkships,” the BLSA statement read. “Harvard BLSA neither supports nor endorses Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination.”
During the hearing Wednesday, Sen. Michael D. Crapo (R-Idaho), a Law School graduate, introduced the letter signed by current and former Harvard BLSA members and asked that the letter be submitted to the record.
“This is a letter that exhibits Judge Kavanaugh’s commitment to fostering diversity in the legal profession,” Crapo said.
Crapo then went on to read aloud excerpts from the letter. It was submitted without objection.
Though the letter states that it is not an official statement from the organization and only represents the views of the individuals who signed it, Crapo did not mention this fact.
“Please note that this letter is not a statement from BLSA as an organization,” the letter reads. “The students who have signed below write to express appreciation for the Judge’s enthusiasm on this issue and hope that his efforts will be taken into consideration.”
Later on in Wednesday’s hearing, Kavanaugh responded to questioning from Sen. Cory A. Booker  (D-N.J.) regarding race by saying that he reached out the Black Law Students Association at Yale to recruit members to apply to clerkships.
“I started — on my own — going to the Yale Black Law Students Association every year starting in 2012. I think I’m the only judge who has done something like that or certainly one of the few. And I just cold called them, cold emailed them and said I’d like to come speak about minority law clerk hiring because I’m told there’s a problem,” Kavanaugh said.
Kavanaugh’s hearing is set to continue Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recalling the Harvard senior's humor and friendship, more than 100 students and friends came together Thursday evening to celebrate the life of Courtney S. Blair '19.
Blair, an Economics concentrator who lived in Dunster House, died suddenly over the summer at her home in Georgia. Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana wrote in a July 6 email that Blair was a “beloved member of the College community” and that her loss is “heartbreaking.”
At the gathering, held at the Spee Club, friends and former roommates stood up one by one to share stories of meaningful experiences they shared with Blair. The anecdotes, both funny and serious, underscored the unconditional love Blair held for her friends and the joy she brought to everyone who knew her.
Attendees aimed to paint a full picture of Blair’s time at the College, ranging from first encounters during the admitted students weekend, Visitas, to late-night conversations in her dorm room.
“I think there was such a broad range of stories shared that just expressed so many different sides to her,” said Emily Corrigan ’19, a close friend of Blair's who helped organize Thursday’s memorial service. “It was just a really touching representation of Courtney and a really nice way to remember her and I think people really needed it.”
Midway through the service, a group of Blair’s friends performed an emotional rendition of “Hallelujah.”
Pictures of Blair lined the walls of the clubhouse Thursday. Flowers and candles lay scattered around the upstairs room in which the service was held. Students snacked on Fruit Gushers — one of Blair’s favorite foods, according to Corrigan.
Undergraduates who had known Blair pressed into a large upstairs room to remember and to say goodbye. So many of them came that the crowd overflowed into the adjacent stairwell.
“The fact that so many people were here, too, was just a testament to how much Courtney touched all of us,” Corrigan said.
During her time at Harvard, Blair worked at the Harvard Shop, was a member of the Spee, participated in the boxing club, and tutored students in economics and statistics. This past summer, she worked as an intern for the Boston Consulting Group in her home state.
At the service, multiple attendees mentioned Blair's drive and predicted that she would have been the CEO of a major company, had she lived.
Several attendees said the event was meant to bring people together to create a “sacred space” to allow everyone to cope with the loss. After the service, some students lingered in the Spee to more informally share memories of Blair.
Dozens lined up to sign the guest book for the event.
“I think it was really important to have people come together to just process it and be there for one another because this all happened over the summer,” Corrigan said. “No one really got the chance to get through it and it’s hard to do on your own.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a tough 3-2 overtime loss in its season opener against Albany, Harvard men’s soccer (1-2) looked to bounce back as it kicked off its 2018-19 home campaign with games against Providence on Monday and No. 22 UMass Lowell on Thursday.
The Crimson came out on top 2-1 in a tightly contested match versus the Friars to start off the week, before falling 2-0 to the River Hawks last night.
Harvard is gunning for its first Ivy League championship in almost a decade, with its last title coming back in 2009.
No. 22 UMASS LOWELL 2, HARVARD 0
After a thunderstorm delayed kickoff and thoroughly wet the playing surface, the Crimson fell by a score of 2-0 to UMass Lowell (4-0-1) on Thursday night at Jordan field.
Despite a promising start for Harvard, the River Hawks showed their quality over the course of the 90 minutes, with the Crimson unable to keep pace with the nationally-ranked program. Freshman forward Nico Garcia-Morillo almost found the back of the net early on, as he was played into a one-on-one situation in the third minute, but senior keeper Zach Rowell got down well to deny the striker. This early shot on goal proved to be the one of the best chances for Harvard on the night.
Harvard had stretches of possession throughout the game, mostly early on in the first half, but it struggled to apply sustained pressure on the UMass defense, rarely getting into the opponent’s 18-yard box.
“I think we started the first 20 pretty solidly,” said midfielder and captain Sam Brown. “We had the ball for a bit, they were in the same formation as us so we matched up pretty well against them. We generated some good chances in the first half.”
UMass broke the deadlock six minutes before the half through junior Roko Prsa. The midfielder rose up to meet a ball in the air with an overhead kick after the Crimson failed to clear its lines, firing past junior goalkeeper Jorma Görns to put the River Hawks ahead in the 39th minute.
Görns got to see his first minutes of the season, and the first of his Harvard career, after sophomore goalkeeper Matt Freese was forced to leave the field with an injury to his left arm in the 32nd minute. Freese came up with a big save on the ground versus sophomore Mayele Malongo before the striker clattered into him, ending his night early.
“When you have a player go down, it’s a difficult blow,” head coach Pieter Lehrer said. The goalie is a big part of your group.”
UMass started to take control of the game early on in the second half, creating a handful of chances in the first 10 minutes of the second 45. The Crimson came close to conceding an own goal after a cross bounced around the box before finally striking the post and going out of bounds to safety for a corner.
Harvard finally cracked under the River Hawks’ near-relentless pressure in the 57th minute, as Prsa bagged his second goal of the night. The midfielder put a curling free kick into the Crimson’s 18-yard box, where it skidded across the wet surface, seeming to catch Görns by surprise. With his feet not set correctly, he attempted to make up for it, getting a hand on the ball, but it was only enough to push it into the net, doubling Harvard’s deficit.
Despite being marred by an unlucky mistake after being called from the bench, Görns had a solid game in goal, coming up with important saves throughout the game, and finishing the night with 3 stops in just under 60 minutes.
The Crimson came painfully close in the 70th minute, after an early cross whipped in from the right flank found junior forward Philip Hausen at the back post. With the goal gaping, the midfielder couldn’t find the finish needed, heading into the ground rather than into the back of the net.
In the 86th minute, Harvard almost sparked a comeback through freshman forward Alex Debayo-Doherty, who split two defenders with some tricky dribbling before firing at the bottom corner from 20 yards. Rowell stretched well to deny the freshman his second goal of the campaign.
“The guys work hard, they fight hard in training,” Lehre said. “They’ll rebound well. They do a great job of seeing what they did well, what they need to improve, and making the changes and coming back tomorrow.”
HARVARD 2, PROVIDENCE 1
A strong, disciplined defensive display from the Crimson was the difference in this one, as the hosts dispatched Providence (1-2-1) by a score of 2-1 on Monday in their first home match of the season. First half goals from sophomore forward Cesar Farias Jr. and senior defender Jack Miler proved to be enough for Harvard to seal its first win on the year.
With the temperature on the pitch hovering around 92 degrees fahrenheit at kickoff, the referee had to call for cooling breaks at the halfway point of each half to ensure the safety of the players.
While the Crimson struggled to connect its passes early on, Providence seemed to have control of the game for most of the first half. Harvard’s defense came up with some big tackles to stop Providence on the break, while Freese was kept fairly busy in the net, making 4 saves in his first career win.
The Crimson opted to attack almost exclusively by utilizing its wide men, which ended up paying off. Farias Jr. was able to break the deadlock in the 37th minute, after a beautifully placed diagonal ball found sophomore midfielder Sebastian Lindner-Liaw on the left flank. He crossed with his second touch, finding Farias Jr. at the back post, who finished coolly first-time for Harvard’s first home goal of the season.
Providence came close at a few occasions in the first half, most strikingly in the 19th minute. Freshman midfielder Kevin Vang collected the ball at the corner of the box, taking on the defense with a series of step-overs and firing a curling shot towards goal, but he was denied by the crossbar.
As the seconds ticked off the clock at the end of the first half, sophomore midfielder Paolo Belloni-Urso whipped in a corner kick, which was met in mid-air by Miler, who redirected perfectly into the top corner to grab his first goal of the season, as well as his first ever in a Crimson jersey. With just three seconds remaining at the time of the goal, Harvard went into the half up 2-0.
The youth ended up being the difference for the Crimson, with one goal and both assists coming from sophomores. Freshman midfielder Håvard Hjermstad looked dangerous whenever he had the ball on the right flank, while fellow freshman forward Debayo-Doherty put in a good shift up top.
“We’re obviously pretty young but everyone is really talented,” Brown said. “It’s early in the season so we’re still building confidence and still building chemistry. I think if we stay positive, everything will come together a little bit more.”
