After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A small cast and crew of students are bringing Sophocles’ “Electra” to the Adams Pool Theatre on April 12 and to theaters around the world this summer. Director Isaiah O. Michalski ’21 and producer Lily W. Grob ’22 seek to bring to life a dialogue on gender that remains relevant, despite the centuries separating the source material from its audience today.
“It’s a play in which we see women talking about gender and in which the ideas are nuanced. These are by no means easy characters or somehow the ideal members of society. These are really, really difficult people,” Michalski said.
Out of the cast of seven, four main characters are women. The titular Electra mourns the death of her father after her mother murders him. Without much action, the dialogue-driven story centers around an emotional journey.
A. Balim Barutçu ’19, who plays Electra, says family is a crucial theme of the story.
“How our mothers and fathers and siblings are forever etched into our mettle, our spirits, is something that I’ve been thinking about with this character,” Barutçu said. “What are the boundaries of love and hatred and how do they coexist? Part of the emotional mission or message of this show is that most emotion exists in a gray area, as do concepts like justice and morality.”
In order to explore the play’s dynamics of emotion, gender, and family, the production has taken a deeply collaborative approach to interpreting the story.
“I’m coming at it from a male perspective, so we’ve relied super heavily, firstly, on Lily, who’s also creative producer, but also with the cast together to build the concept,” Michalski said.“So instead of coming at the play with a set idea of who these characters are, after our first read-through we spent a few hours just discussing, what is this play about, who presents as what gender and why, and how do their different roles in government or family relate to their gender?”
The show will run in the Adams Pool Theatre April 12 to 14 and again on May 4 as a part of the Arts First Festival. The Arts First performance, which will take place outdoors, will also incorporate Pablo Eduardo’s sculpture “The Furies.”
“The Furies are actually a big part of the show. They represent justice, and they are three females who, in acting for justice, torment people. They fit really well with the Oresteia, which ‘Electra’ is a part of, a collection of Sophocles,” Grob said. “ The statues themselves are in agony but they’re so strong. There’s also something scary and unnatural about them which captures the mood.”
Over the summer, the production will take “Electra” to theaters in London, Berlin, and Istanbul. Several members of the cast and crew have international ties, including Barutcu and Ece Hakim ’21 who will deliver their scenes in Turkish at the Istanbul performance.
“We want to connect [the show] back to the roots of wherever we are,” Grob said. “We want this to be a show that everybody can relate to the emotions of. Our main focus is not the technical aspects. It’s nothing more than the emotions and the characters at the heart of this. Even if they spoke in complete gibberish, anybody can relate to what they’re feeling.”

I recently rediscovered “The Two Faces of American Freedom” by Aziz F. Rana ’00, and I have to say, it makes for fascinating reading. Fundamentally a history of American democracy, Rana’s book probes a central question of our national past: How have we straddled the line between republic and empire?
In the book, we learn that it was by splitting our focus between internal and external objectives. The internal focus of American power, Rana argues, was always on securing economic independence and political equality for members of the civic community — an idea that he calls “freedom as self-rule.” It was our common commitment to this kind of liberty that produced some of the most radical political innovations in our history. The founders, for instance, weren’t just rejecting monarchy. They were declaring a right to equal membership in the political community — a right that, in theory, applied universally. This idea, Rana shows, would prove bountiful later on. Before the close of the frontier in 1890, non-citizen immigrants could vote in over 20 states and receive land grants from the federal government — both ideas almost unthinkable in President Donald Trump’s America.
The gifts of liberty, though, were always limited to the narrowly defined political community. Rana emphasizes how economic independence and participatory power in politics historically went hand-in-hand with the evacuation of American Indians, the enslavement of Africans, and the conquest of foreign land — Mexican, Hawaiian, and for shorter stints, Cuban and Filipino. This is what Rana calls our external commitment: a pattern of projecting our collective power on those deemed outsiders.
This tension — between a robust sense of liberty internally and a disregard for that principle externally — frames Rana’s diagnosis of our present-day political illness: that we have become mesmerized by the fruits of our global police power, even letting it corrupt our core commitment to liberty as self-rule. Rana’s phrasing is especially compelling: “empire, so to speak, has become the master rather than the servant of freedom.”
As Americans, we navigate a unique political culture in which our civic language of rights, checks, and balances seems to contradict our historical record of interventionism abroad. The cultural consequences are often vexing, as when Democratic presidential candidate Pete P. M. Buttigieg ’04 — the mayor of South Bend, Ind. — tweeted, “I did not carry an assault weapon around a foreign country so I could come home and see them used to massacre my countrymen.” Our norms of internal liberty and civic responsibility remain tied to our experiences of war abroad.
We might lend our concerted critical attention to this relationship as the 2020 election approaches. This means staying alert to the way that terms like “national security” have started to replace ideas of freedom and rights-bearing — since George Washington’s time, our most important national gifts.
This doesn’t mean scrapping — as some on the left might envision — our entire political inheritance. I have written before in these pages on the exceptionalism of our American experience. I, like Rana, stand by the idea of liberty as self-rule (an original American invention). That idea welcomed millions of immigrants to American shores, promising land and a vote. It is worth studying today, when both parties still agree that such policies are incompatible with our national security and labor standards.
Our challenge is not to punish ourselves for the sins of our past but to rein in the empire, to make it the servant of liberty and then phase it out.
There is certainly reason for optimism. Politicians are paying more critical attention to our foreign military commitments now than at any time after 9/11. The recent vote in the Senate to end U.S. support for the war in Yemen was an important symbolic shift, even if Trump may veto the measure. The exit of U.S. troops from Libya this week may mean the tide is turning, that we are finally reining in the empire.
We can extend these gains into civic and social life too, by ending “catch-and-detain” tactics at the U.S.-Mexico border and limiting our appeals to police power in interpersonal disputes, where we often rehearse old settler habits against racial minorities. These kinds of encounters are the vestiges of our empire, which exerted force upon outsiders even as it protected the freedom of insiders. To universalize the promises of settler liberty, we need to part with those imperial vestiges.
I maintain that Rana’s reading of history is a powerful one for the present day, when politics forces us to choose, falsely, between two visions of America: one that ignores our national sins and another that cannot forgive them. In “The Two Faces of American Freedom,” we find that America has always been both a safeguard of liberty and a rogue conquistador, a land-hungry slave power and a democratic deliverer. This is something like Bill Clinton’s famous view, that “there is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.”
What is wrong with America today is our imperial thinking, which has captivated the public mind with foreign wars and security concerns. If anything can cure that thinking, it will be a radical love for liberty, extended beyond the settler society to all.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes I feel like I’m a passenger on a train traveling at the speed of light. I’m stuck barreling towards the end of the semester, at high risk of crashing but perfectly incapable of slowing down or getting off. Keep reading if this resonates with you.
What seemed like every morning before high school, my mom would look down at me as she poured boiling water into my instant oatmeal. “Adam,” she would caution, “you have to learn how to slow down. You’re spreading yourself too thin.”
I knew I was overextending myself, but what else was I supposed to do? As a student in this high-pressure world, I had by that point internalized the idea that the only way to succeed was to do everything. When I arrived at Harvard, a microcosm of the eager high school go-getters, nothing really changed. We here at Harvard pride ourselves on being hopelessly overcommitted.
Yesterday, I texted a friend taking a much-needed semester off. She is — as expected — thriving. I laughed to myself as I casually remarked to her, “It is so dumb, the speed at which we live our lives.”
It’s true: Looking out the window on our train, can we not help but notice how fast the world is going by? When’s the last time you read something and really digested it? The last time you took a second to learn about something your friend is passionate about, or took time to tell someone about something you find meaningful?
When’s the last time you called your mom? The last time she picked up the phone and asked what you needed, and you just replied, “Nothing, just wanted to say hi.”
It’s hard (and quite unrealistic) for me to write an op-ed about slowing down the train. After all, central to the ocular metaphor I opened with was the fact that the train can’t be slowed down. You can’t just “hop off.” You’ve picked your classes, made your extracurricular commitments, scheduled your phone interviews, and replied “going” on Facebook RSVPs.
I know what you’re thinking: It is well within our ability to flake on friends, call in sick to extracurriculars, and skip classes. But, we all know that flaking isn’t really fixing the problem.
After I have a bout of “free spiritedness” and impulsively shelve my schedule for the day, after I skip working on a problem set in favor of blacking out for the night, or after I push off texting a friend back about “catching a meal,” I still struggle to find some relief from the immense pressure of life at Harvard.
Frankly, that’s because being “hopelessly overcommitted” is part of our reality here at Harvard. Even if I swear that next semester will be “better,” I will probably find myself on the same high-speed train next semester.
Before I knew it, my seven semesters left at Harvard turned into five, turned into three, and will soon turn into one. I’ll be barreling towards a destination that is in fact the end of a chapter in my life. As graduation becomes all too real, I’ll have cause to reflect on what I really saw as I watched the world speed by outside my window. The people I met, the routines I lived, and the transformations I underwent for four years will be but a blur as I prepare to reframe my life for the real world.
So, pay more careful attention to the world passing by outside your window.
Capitalize on the moments you have to take in the world around you. Instead of scrolling through your Instagram feed as you walk to class, take a second and observe the vibrancy of life in Harvard Square. Sacrifice a few minutes before bed to ask how your roommate’s day was, and actually pay attention when they answer you. Call your parents and check in on them when you’re taking a break from your problem set. And for God’s sake, if you’re going to be drunk at El Jefe’s at 2 a.m. on a Saturday night, crack jokes with the other drunk burrito-eaters and maybe you’ll make a new friend.
Treat your time here at Harvard as an end in itself: as a chapter in your life that doesn’t have to be but a stepping stone to the next best thing. If you can’t slow down the train, you can at least take a deep breath and ask yourself how you can be a better witness to the beautiful experiences you’re presented with every second of every day.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Editor:
While University President Lawrence S. Bacow has much to say about the heckler’s veto, he apparently has nothing to say about his use of agenda-setting powers to continue to suppress a full reckoning with institutional failures over the accusations regarding Government Professor Emeritus Jorge I. Dominguez.
The administration has resolutely ignored or refused student requests to launch an external review of how allegations went unaddressed for 36 years. In doing so, they have avoided discussion of how, and even whether, changes to the University’s Title IX policies over the past few years would have triggered an investigation into incidents like the alleged groping of an administration staff member in 2015.
While I cannot speak to the specifics of the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, it is therefore unsurprising that protesters turned down invitations to air their grievances at another time and place. Bacow’s op-ed calls on the University community to provide a model of reasoned dialogue for a national public discourse that “has become so coarse,” yet fails to note that coarse discourse on campus and elsewhere is in large part due to a more fundamental breakdown in mutual trust — trust that must be regained by institutions of authority rather than demanded of students and citizens alike. Thus far, the experience of the Government Department suggests that polite, convenient protests and attempts at civil dialogue result in having concerns ignored rather than being placed on the agenda for debate.
In contrast, when the supply of future applicants and tuition dollars are on the line, the Harvard administration has responded with alacrity. Allegations of a major conflict-of-interest involving head fencing coach Peter Brand, linking the University in spirit to the Varsity Blues admission scandal, saw Harvard launch an independent investigation within days.
Perhaps Bacow can provide The Crimson with an alternative explanation of why a breach of trust with applicants to the College takes clear precedence over a major breach of trust with students in the Government Department and the entire campus community. Yet as trust lies at the core of civil debate, clear efforts to restore that trust would carry far more weight than lecturing us about the dangers of inconveniencing the administration.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hundreds of students and alumni recently signed a letter addressed to top University officials calling into question Harvard Divinity School’s decision to deny Ahmed Ragab tenure. The letter claims he would have been the first Muslim faculty member at the Divinity School accorded that status, and that he is the first faculty member in a decade to be denied full professorship without the review of an ad hoc tenure committee.
This incident should sound familiar. In February, three student and alumni groups wrote letters to University President Lawrence S. Bacow calling into question the coming departure of two faculty members who specialize in Asian-American Studies. One of those professors accepted a position elsewhere, while the University declined to put up the other for tenure.
It’s difficult for us to opine on any of these incidents specifically, shrouded as they are by the mystery of academic politics and processes, especially as they relate to employment. But we can say with confidence that these incidents reflect a moment on our campus in which students and their allies are calling the University’s labor practices into question.
The graduate student unionization process has been symbolic of this broader discontent. The negotiating process — nearly six months old with no end in sight — has been plagued by slowdowns and roadblocks. Discontent with the pace of negotiations, among other issues, led some 150 supporters of the burgeoning union to rally outside Massachusetts Hall in March to deliver a petition demanding more frequent bargaining sessions and a third-party arbitration process for cases of discrimination and sexual misconduct.
As students rally behind Ragab and the two Asian-American Studies professors, they draw upon this activist energy. In particular, they seem to suggest that tenure decisions have seemed — though bureaucratic opacity prevents any concrete conclusions — to run counter to a strong desire to increase the diversity of specialities and faces on Harvard’s faculty. The University must respond in earnest to this growing tide of activism and discontent. As such, we call on the University to take three broad actions.
First, the University needs to take stock of its labor practices and think critically about the way they affect those who make this University the intellectual powerhouse it is. Certainly, this is not the first time community members have asked the University to consider these issues. But now, today, the range and volume of students’ voices on this topic should ring loudly in the ears of administrators.
Second, the University should make its labor practices more transparent. The University’s approach to unionization should be clear to the student body. We should not wonder where the University stands on the majority of the 80 proposals brought by the union, while only two articles appear to have been publicly agreed on. And the University should lead the way in making academic employment practices, especially tenure, more transparent.
Third, the University should directly and specifically address the petitions, protests, and statements students and other community members make about labor practices openly and honestly.
In a moment of heightened student activism and unrest — the drivers of which go beyond labor movements to include divestment campaigns, condemnation of faculty behavior, and the continued interest in the introduction of an ethnic studies department — the University needs to respond to students openly and with good faith. Veritas may be only a word, but it represents a powerful idea. The calls of students, too, represent an idea: an admirable commitment to seek justice and call out injustice, no matter the source. It’s time for the University to listen.

The Harvard Business School satellite health clinic is slated to close on May 31, Harvard University Health Services director Paul J. Barreira said in an interview last week.
The Business School’s satellite clinic is located at the heart of its campus, roughly a mile away from the the Harvard Square clinic in the Smith Campus Center. The Square clinic will now serve as the only University health center for Business School students.
Barreira said conversations about the move took place between the Business School and HUHS this past fall and winter. He cited the increased number of services offered in the Smith Campus Center location and also the growing connections between the Business School and the University as two of the main reasons for moving the clinic space.
“Several reasons contributed to this decision, including increasing space constraints at HBS, the wide array of services available at the Smith Campus Center, and the growing diversity of joint degree and cross-registered HBS students who are traveling throughout Harvard,” Barreira wrote in an email statement to The Crimson.
Jana Kierstead, the executive director of the MBA and doctoral programs, also credited the rising number of joint degree students as part of the reason for the satellite clinic’s closing.
“We have now have 10 percent of our student body doing joint degrees and they are taking classes all across campus,” Kierstead said.
Located in the Smith Campus Center, the Harvard Square clinic acts as the hub for HUHS. It currently offers primary care and internal medicine, counseling and mental health services, behavioral health, as well as other speciality services. The Harvard Square clinic also houses Urgent Care — a 24/7 service open to Harvard affiliates in need of immediate medical attention.
The Business School clinic, however, is limited to providing services Monday through Friday.
Business School patients have been informed of the the different steps they can take in order to maintain their care in the midst of the clinic’s relocation. They are provided with “opportunities to connect” with HUHS Chief Medical Officer Soheyla Gharib if they need medical advice when deciding on new primary care providers under the new system, according to HUHS Spokesperson Michael Perry.
“We have every confidence that patients will experience a seamless transition of care from the HBS clinic to the Harvard Square clinic,” Perry wrote in an email to The Crimson.
Despite the closure of the HBS satellite clinic, the two other satellite clinics — located at Harvard Law School and Longwood Medical Area — have no plans to close anytime soon.
“When the HUHS Law School Clinic was renovated a few years ago, the space for the clinic was thoughtfully planned and a significant investment was made by the Law School to support an HUHS presence on their campus,” Perry wrote. “The Medical Area Clinic serves three schools in the Longwood area: the Medical School, the Dental School, and the School of Public Health, and is heavily utilized.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard launched its search for a new public service dean last week, nearly a year after the former assistant dean for public service, Gene A. Corbin, left the post.
In an April 5 online job posting, the role is now titled “Assistant Dean for Civic Engagement and Service.” College Dean for Administration and Finance Sheila C. Thimba — who has served as Interim Dean of Public Service since Corbin’s departure — wrote in an emailed statement that the College plans to also hire a “faculty director” for public service who will oversee the assistant dean’s work.
During Corbin’s 15 years at Harvard — first as the executive director of the Phillips Brooks House Association, then as the public service dean — he piloted a series of initiatives aimed at encouraging undergraduates to pursue service during the school year, on breaks, and after they graduate.
In the months following Corbin’s decision to step down last spring, administrators announced a review of the College’s public service initiatives. At the time, Thimba said the position needed some updating after Corbin’s long tenure.
Thimba wrote in her statement Thursday that the review produced several changes to the way the College approaches public service initiatives, chief among them the addition of an additional administrative role. The “faculty director” will oversee the Phillips Brooks House Association and the Mindich Program in Engaged Scholarship; the assistant dean will direct the Center for Public Interest Careers and the Public Service Network.
“We are eager to meet with both external and internal candidates who can bring a broad range of experience that will help guide new and innovative programming to meet the needs of our students,” Thimba wrote.
The search comes at a time when few Harvard undergraduates pursue careers in public service after graduation. Only 3.5 percent of the Class of 2018 annual senior survey respondents indicated they were going to pursue post-graduate work in public service. The year before, 6.0 percent said they planned do the same.
The assistant dean job posting lists a host of responsibilities, from fundraising to meeting regularly with directors of public service fellowships. It also requires that candidates have at least eight years of “progressively senior leadership roles in a non-profit, educational, or public-serving organization.”
The College will begin reviewing candidates’ resumes on May 13, according to the job posting. Until administrators select a candidate, Thimba wrote she will continue to serve as interim dean.

The percentage of female and underrepresented minority faculty at Harvard has remained largely stagnant over the past year, according to the University’s annual Faculty Diversity and Development report released Wednesday.
The report, produced by Senior Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity Judith D. Singer's office, outlines trends in the number of female and minority ladder faculty within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and across Harvard’s eight professional schools. Those figures have steadily increased since 2004.
The University’s ladder faculty comprises both tenured professors and those on the tenure track, including assistant and associate professors.
Singer said in an interview Thursday that the goal of the report is to ensure Harvard affiliates are aware of the most current data on faculty demographics.
“If you can measure something, you can hold people accountable,” Singer said. “So part of what we're doing with these annual reports is we're hoping this goes up on bulletin boards all over campus.”
The percentage of tenure-track faculty who identify as underrepresented minorities increased this year to 13 percent from 11 percent in 2018, continuing a 15-year trend of gradual growth, starting at 8 percent in 2004, the earliest year included in the report.
The percentages of tenured women and underrepresented minorities at the University remained constant from last year at 27 percent and 8 percent, respectively, though both of those figures have risen since 2004.
The University has not set out to grow the ranks of its ladder faculty since the 2008 economic crash decimated Harvard’s endowment, freezing faculty salary raises and halting ongoing faculty searches.
That lack of overall growth poses difficulties for the University as it attempts to diversify its faculty, according to Singer.
“When you're increasing in size, it's a lot easier to diversify, because you're not only just hiring to replace, you're hiring because you're increasing in size,” she said. “When we were growing, there was real opportunity, but we weren't necessarily as deeply committed to it. Now, we're deeply committed to it, but we're not growing.”
The report uses 2004 as a baseline to examine longer-term trends in faculty diversity, which Singer said could appear slow on a year-to-year basis.
“We will change this University one hire at a time, one promotion at a time,” Singer said. “That's how we make change.”
Ultimately, Singer said her primary concern with the report was that faculty could be “too satisfied” with the increases in women and underrepresented minorities over time.
“If I have any concern, it's that people will look at these numbers and say, ‘Gee, we're doing so well. We don't need to worry about this anymore,’” Singer said. “In fact, I had somebody say that to me, and I had to explain why that was not the case.”
The report also contains information about initiatives each school has undertaken during the current academic year to diversify its faculty. The Harvard Kennedy School, for instance, implemented training to help faculty “identify” unconscious bias in order to understand how it can lead to “biased decision making.” The School of Public Health held a series of professional development events to support tenure-track underrepresented minority faculty.
Despite the new initiatives, Singer argued that the University still has "more work to do.” She said administrators, including University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay, remained “deeply committed” to diversity efforts.
In a March interview, Gay said that finding prospective faculty members from underrepresented minority groups can sometimes require “more work,” but that those efforts are necessary to stem the commonly cited “leaky pipeline,” in which minority and female professors leave the profession due to a lack of mentorship and support.
“There are probably some fields where progress will be slower, but I think progress is still possible if we’re willing to put our shoulder to the wheel and actually get this work done,” Gay said.

Nekesa C. Straker will serve as the new senior assistant dean of residential life and first-year students starting next academic year, Associate Dean of Students Lauren E. Brandt announced in an email to undergraduates Thursday afternoon.
“In her new role, Nekesa will be responsible for leading the First Year Experience (FYE) office, which will include everything from managing the Resident Deans of First-Year Students, overseeing residential life initiatives to help orient and support the incoming class, and coordinate housing assignments for first-year students,” Brandt wrote.
Straker’s responsibilities will include training residential staff, overseeing pre-orientation programs, planning freshman Convocation, coordinating undergraduate advising, and sitting on the Administrative Board, according to Brandt’s email.
Straker wrote in an emailed statement that she is excited to bring her "enthusiasm" to the job.
“I am excited to bring to the Yard my enthusiasm for supporting students throughout their first-year residential experience and it’s an honor to be joining such a talented team,” Straker wrote. “I am looking forward to beginning in June and getting to know the students that make up the Harvard College community.”
Straker currently oversees residential life for undergraduates at Boston College as its director of residential education, a job she began in 2015.
“In that role she has been responsible for managing the day-to-day experience of residential life for 7,600 residents spanning across 14 residential communities,” Brandt’s announcement reads.
Before her work in Chestnut Hill, Straker held related administrative positions at Seattle University, DePaul University, and New York University — where she concentrated especially on freshman life — and worked for the admissions office of a private K-12 school system in Seattle.
Straker — who is originally from New York City — completed her undergraduate degree at Vassar College and graduate coursework at Seattle University. She is currently finishing a doctorate in higher education leadership at Regis College.
The new hire follows a year of major administrative restructuring at the College. The Dean of Student's Office, led by Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, formed as the result of a July 2018 merger between the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life. Administrators said they decided to make the changes to centralize administrative oversight of residential and social life for College students.
Straker will begin her tenure June 17.

Harvard Management Company — the firm that oversees the University's multi-billion dollar endowment — is now investing in a new cryptocurrency, Blockstack, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings released Wednesday, a move some experts have said is still unusual for investors of its magnitude.
Harvard-affiliated investors purchased 95.8 million “stacks tokens” in the firm’s initial coin offering. The purchase price was not included in the filings. If valued at the average price for all 395.2 million tokens the firm has sold so far — about 12 cents — Harvard’s newly purchased tokens are worth about $11.5 million. The new investment makes up less than 0.05 percent of Harvard’s endowment, which is valued at nearly $40 billion.
Ronald A. Glantz ’62, senior advisor at Bitcoin and digital currency-investment firm Pantera, said that no investment manager should have more than 2 percent of their assets in blockchain — and even that small percentage needs to be diversified across multiple currencies.
“If Harvard believed that blockchain was the future, then they should buy 50 companies because most of them will fail,” said Glantz, a self-described “believer in the blockchain.”
Robert J. Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale and Nobel Laureate, said blockchain-related investments are in vogue at the moment, but may be overhyped.
“You can’t prove they were wrong for doing it. As people who take risks in investing, they might be right. I just have a sense that the enthusiasm for blockchain is a bit out of proportion,” he said.
New York University professor and former Managing Editor of The Crimson David L. Yermack ’85, said the decision to invest in cryptocurrency is relatively new for a large institutional investor like Harvard.
Both Shiller and Yermack said the investment, even if it may be risky, is a step toward increased diversification of Harvard’s portfolio.
In addition to Harvard, Yale has also reportedly recently invested in a cryptocurrency fund. Both Yermack and Glantz said others would follow.
“You’re going to see more and more of this from the leading schools,” Yermack said, though he also noted that it might be “decades” before investing in cryptocurrency became standard practice for university endowment managers.
HMC spokesperson Patrick S. McKiernan declined to comment, citing the company’s policy of not commenting on specific investments.
Blockstack was founded in 2017 under the umbrella of Blockstack PBC, a company founded in 2013. The firm filed with the SEC Wednesday morning, laying out the details of its planned offering.
At least one member of Blockstack’s board of directors is a Harvard alumnus — Albert E. Wenger ’91 studied economics at the College.
This may not be the first time Harvard has invested in cryptocurrency — last October, a report in The Information, citing an anonymous source, said that HMC and several other university endowments had invested in a cryptocurrency fund.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Association of American Universities released its second national sexual misconduct survey April 2 in collaboration with Westat — a research firm that faced employment discrimination charges in 2014.
The AAU and Westat first collaborated on the Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct — which looks at students’ experiences with sexual harassment on college campuses — in 2015. Harvard participated in the inaugural survey, and its results have heavily influenced Harvard’s approach to combating sexual misconduct.
This year marks the second sexual misconduct survey collaboration between the AAU and Westat, with 33 institutions including Harvard participating.
The discrimination allegations against Westat date back to 2009, when the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs conducted a routine audit of Westat’s employment policies, practices, and record keeping. The OFCCP found statistically significant hiring disparities for race and gender. In 2014, Westat and the OFCCP entered a conciliation agreement to resolve the violation.
In the settlement, Westat paid $1.5 million in back wages and interest to 3,651 affected applicants. The firm also agreed to make 113 job offers to the original people impacted by the former hiring practices as positions became available.
Westat Senior Study Director Susan Chibnall — the project director for both the 2015 and 2019 AAU surveys — wrote in an email to The Crimson that Westat has since modified its procedures to operate in accordance with guidance from the OFCCP.
“Westat is a majority female company with a strong representation of minorities. Our policies and actions are, and always have been, in conformance with Equal Employment Opportunity and our Affirmative Action Plan,” Chibnall wrote.
Pedro Ribeiro, vice president for communications at the AAU, wrote in an email to The Crimson that the AAU had engaged in a “competitive open-bid process” when it selected a research firm to partner with.
Ribeiro wrote that Westat’s previous successes in large-scale survey projects, its ability to deliver a lower overall cost, and its option for customized questions for each institution were all factors that led to the AAU’s selection.
“We believe that the issues raised by the settlement have been resolved, including the payment of restitution,” he added.
Harvard played no role in hiring Westat to administer the survey, University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain wrote in an emailed statement.
“While Harvard was not responsible for the selection of Westat as the vendor to administer the survey, it is our understanding that the matters resolved by the 2014 Department of Labor settlement predate the administration of the 2015 survey by several years,” Swain wrote.
“Harvard students should have every confidence in the impact they can have through participation in the 2019 AAU survey that is currently underway,” Swain added.
Swain, Chibnall, and Ribeiro all stated that Westat’s settlement with the OFCCP is a thing of the past — and they all encouraged students to take the AAU survey in 2019, citing the importance of the data collection in informing efforts to combat sexual misconduct.
Since the 2015 AAU survey was administered, Harvard has seen several changes to its sexual harassment prevention efforts, including increased staffing within the University Title IX Office and the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response; the separation of the Title IX Office and the Office for Dispute Resolution, which investigates formal Title IX complaints; and new school-specific trainings for students, faculty, and staff.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Brazilian artist Oscar Araripe discussed his bright and colorful collection of paintings “Flowers for Harvard” — on display in Leverett House this week — Thursday night at Leverett Library Theater.
Araripe’s friend Peter B. Rodenbeck ’61 also spoke at the event, which was part of programming organized by Leverett House Faculty Deans Brian D. Farrell and Irina P. Ferreras to foster interaction between Araripe and Leverett students.
At the talk, Araripe said he had previously studied at Harvard in the 1960s to escape political persecution at the hands of the Brazilian military, which controlled the government at the time. He had been elected to the student union at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and was vocal in his opposition for the government. Araripe was not allowed to attend classes and feared arrest or death, according to a pamphlet distributed to audience members.
Reflecting on his return to Harvard, Araripe said he received two scholarships to study at the University, which “saved” his life.
“These scholarships was very important in my life,” he said. “It saved my life because at that time I was punished by the dictatorship in Brazil.”
Though Araripe was not a full-time artist at the time, he said his experience at Harvard shaped his appreciation for painting. He said he visited the Fogg Museum frequently.
“The first time I saw the great masters in painting was here at Harvard,” Araripe said.
Araripe added he believes art is important in all areas of life.
“I think that art gives the direction and the solution for all kinds of things — political, economical, social. I believe strongly in this. I work in this, in solutions through art,” he said. “I believe in the government of the poet.”
Leverett resident Luke G. Melas-Kyriazi ’20 said he appreciated the addition of Araripe’s art to the House.
“The hallway downstairs has always been kind of drab and just not very exciting. And now it’s really nice to have lots of stuff in it. Especially, the paintings are kind of colorful and they really liven up Lev[erett],” he said.
Lincoln J. Craven-Brightman ’20, another Leverett resident, also said he believed the new art enhanced the House environment.
“I’m super for bringing more art into the house life,” he said. “It’s nice to have some environment where I feel less stressed. It adds something. I don’t know if its quantifiable.”
The weeklong programming on Araripe’s art is part of a new artist in residence program by Farrell and Ferreras, who stepped into the roles of faculty dean in July 2018. Farrell said he hopes to prioritize the arts and international culture in Leverett House.
“We thought, we have this beautiful gallery space, it was designed to hang art, and we just immediately thought this was a good way to start our series of residences, of artists-in-residence in the House,” Farrell said in an interview Thursday.
This past fall, Leverett hosted saxophonist Bill Pierce. Ferreras said the duo hope to host a new artist every semester, giving students the opportunity to engage with artists through lectures, workshops, and casual interactions in the dining hall.
“The idea mostly is to bring the people that visit Harvard to the houses too,” said Ferreras. “Because normally these people visit and they get advertised, but they don’t go to the houses...you’re at Harvard but you can be close to the students by going to the houses, not just in a big auditorium.”
“Our hope is that it gets to be embraced by the students and it’s all about making connections,” Ferreras added. “I don’t know if it’s something that’s being done in other houses. It’s something that came out of our passion.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a surprise appearance, University President Lawrence S. Bacow participated in an hour-long forum about fossil fuel divestment Thursday, an event he previously said he would not attend.
The forum — hosted by Divest Harvard and the Harvard Political Union — also included Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy Cornel R. West ’74, English Professor James T. Engell ’73, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry James G. Anderson, and a Boston financial advisor Karen Shapiro.
On April 4, Bacow declined Divest Harvard’s invitation to attend the student-led forum through an email from his chief of staff. Just two days earlier, Bacow agreed to attend a private discussion with faculty members concerned about Harvard’s continued investment in companies tied to the fossil fuel industry.
The same day Bacow declined to attend the student-led forum, roughly 30 protestors from the Divest Harvard and the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign interrupted a John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum event where he was speaking, forcing the talk to move to a classroom.
At the end of the event, Bacow said he was not encouraged to meet with the protestors again, but he ultimately made an appearance Thursday.
A portion of the forum was dedicated to discussion among the faculty members and Bacow about the possibility of divesting from fossil fuels.
Engell, who said he supports divesting Harvard’s holdings in the fossil fuel industry, noted that the issue of fossil fuel investments has a “stop watch.”
“This is not merely a matter of social change,” Engell said. “This is a matter of planetary fate in the long term.”
Bacow spoke about his past work in environmental economics and policy, and advocated for other means beyond divestment for resolving climate change and fossil fuel reliance.
“We need to engage with those whose behavior we need to change,” Bacow said. “We need to engage with industry. We do that through our scholarship; we do that through our teaching.”
Bacow also explained how previous instances of divestment — such as the University’s divestment from the tobacco industry in 1990 — differ from fossil fuels. He said that tobacco divestment included a complete ban on interacting with tobacco across all spheres of the University, including barring it from campus and prohibiting research funded by tobacco companies in Harvard labs. He said this sort of full-scale divestment is not possible for fossil fuels.
“The day after, if we were to divest, we’re still going to turn on the lights,” Bacow said. “We would still be dependent on fossil fuels.”
Other faculty members on the panel discussed recent decisions by other institutions of higher education such as Stanford University and Middlebury College to divest from the fossil fuel industry as well as the political consequences of Harvard’s divestment from fossil fuels.
“When are the moments in which Harvard can have immense influence in society and decide to be an ethical thermostat rather than apolitical thermometer?” West said.
Ilana A. Cohen ’22, a member of Divest Harvard who moderated the panel, said it was an “invaluable night.”
“I think that that was an unparalleled kind of opportunity that I'm very appreciative that we had the chance to see out in real life tonight,” Cohen said of Bacow’s presence on the panel.
After the moderated portion of the forum, Harvard affiliates asked questions of the panelists.
HPDC member Salma Abdelrahman ’20 accused Bacow of prioritizing dialogue with the fossil fuel divestment movement over the prison divestment movement.
“I just wanted to call out what racism looks like,” Abdelrahman said.
In response, Bacow said that he had met with the prison divestment group “multiple” times but that “civil conversation” ended when the activists laid out their demands. In a March meeting with the group, Bacow told HPDC members that he responds to “reason,” not “demands.”
Bacow also said that Harvard faculty and affiliates have produced prominent scholarship about mass incarceration.
“This is something that, unlike the fossil fuel divestment issue, which has been on the agenda of the Corporation and the University for a long time, to my knowledge, has not been before us previously,” Bacow said.
Thursday’s forum comes ahead of a revitalized “Heat Week” campaign set to take place during the last week of April.
“Heat Week” originally began as week-long protest organized by Divest Harvard in April 2015. Hundreds of students and several faculty members blockaded Massachusetts Hall for a week, occupied the Harvard Alumni Association headquarters for two days, and blockaded University Hall multiple times.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winthrop House tutors Carl L. Miller and Valencia Miller filed a lawsuit against Eliot House Faculty Dean Gail A. O’Keefe in Massachusetts Superior Court on Thursday, alleging that O’Keefe made defamatory statements both about their “professional reputation” and their response to a confrontation between them and a College student on April 3.
The Millers’ complaint and jury trial demand charges O’Keefe with two counts of defamation resulting from an email she wrote Monday evening to Eliot affiliates and a text she wrote to Winthrop Resident Dean Linda D. M. Chavers earlier this semester. The Millers are seeking monetary damages and “such other relief as the Court deems just and equitable.”
The first count of defamation in the Millers’ suit alleges that O’Keefe’s text to Chavers included “false and defamatory statements” about the Millers. Specifically, the Millers claim O’Keefe misrepresented the nature of their decision to leave Eliot, where they previously served as tutors before moving to Winthrop.
O’Keefe allegedly wrote to Chavers on March 7 that the Millers were asked to leave Eliot at a mid-year meeting in 2012, according to the complaint. The complaint states that the Millers informed O’Keefe they planned to leave that year and stayed through the rest of the 2012 spring semester “to maintain continuity for the Eliot community and limit undue stress.”
“I’m happy to explain further, but Carl and Valencia were asked to leave Eliot House at their mid-year meeting in 2012,” O’Keefe wrote in the text. “We have plenty of documentation, and indeed, current tutors here who remember quite well the precipitating circumstances.”
The complaint states that O’Keefe’s statements in her text to Chavers “targeted” the Millers “because of the perception that Plaintiffs supported Dean Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein.”
Winthrop Faculty Dean Ronald S. Sullivan, Jr. has recently faced student backlash for his decision to represent Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein in his Manhattan sexual abuse case.
O’Keefe wrote the text to Chavers shortly after Carl Miller called Harvard police to report graffiti on the exterior of Winthrop House, according to the complaint. The graffiti consisted of slogans criticizing Sullivan’s decision, including “Down w Sullivan!” and “Whose Side Are You On?”
Hours before the vandal spray painted Winthrop, Danu A.K Mudannayake ’20 — an activist who has been outspoken in her calls for Sullivan to step down from his faculty dean position — and a group of other College students distributed flyers in Winthrop. The complaint states that Miller saw Mudannayake and the other students that night and exited the building when they did. Mudannayake wrote in an online post Tuesday that Miller followed her throughout Winthrop House.
Mudannayake, who is also a Crimson design editor, has called for Sullivan to resign in blog posts and at protests, arguing his representation of Weinstein conflicts with the responsibilities of a faculty dean.
Chavers declined to comment on the lawsuit, writing in an email that she is “far too busy supporting and ensuring the personal and academic well-being of the students of Winthrop House to comment on such matters.”
The second count of defamation stems from an email O’Keefe sent over the Eliot House listserv Monday. In the message — which the complaint quotes in full — O’Keefe wrote that the Millers acted “unprofessionally and dishonestly” by filing a police report against Mudannayake on April 3.
“The two Winthrop tutors acted totally unprofessionally and dishonestly. Here at Eliot we would never condone nor allow tutors to make a public attack on an undergraduate, let alone in such a blatant and clumsy political way,” O’Keefe wrote Monday night. “The College should be a place where students can protest without fear of retribution, intimidation or bullying. Eliot House is a place where we stand by your right to be heard.”
The complaint states that O’Keefe’s email over the Eliot listserv also “targeted” the Millers “because of the perception that Plaintiffs supported Dean Sullivan’s representation of Mr. Weinstein.”
Mudannayake — who also filed a police report April 3 — and the Millers offered divergent accounts of what happened in the Winthrop dining hall that evening. Mudannayake said Carl Miller photographed and videotaped her as she ate dinner with a friend; the Millers wrote in emailed statements that Mudannayake harassed them and their child.
The Millers’ suit comes two days after their lawyer — George J. Leontire — sent a letter to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Lawrence S. Bacow, among other University administrators, to criticize O’Keefe’s email to Eliot residents. In the letter, Leontire wrote that the Millers planned to file a Title IX complaint about the confrontation with Mudannayake.
“To my knowledge, no Master/Faculty Dean has ever used his or her superior faculty platform to publicly attack and defame a tutor,” Leontire wrote. “Dean O’Keefe’s actions represent an affront to the norms and values that Faculty Deans strive to uphold.”
O’Keefe declined to comment on the suit.
Mudannayake, Sullivan, and the Millers did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday evening.

Every third Monday of April, approximately 30,000 runners from around the world flood the streets of Boston in order to accomplish a lifelong goal years in the making — participating in the Boston Marathon.
As the world’s oldest annual marathon, the race attracts many hopefuls. This year’s competition received 30,458 applicants who had met the qualifying times for their respective age groups. From that pool, only 10 were allowed to be accompanied by a teammate in a wheelchair.
This year, Harvard University senior Jacob Russell and Edinboro University senior Patrick Dewey will be among these select few.
Jacob Russell, 21, and Patrick Dewey, 22, began their journey to the Boston Marathon as early as elementary school. Both from Cooperstown, New York, the two first met each other after being placed in the same kindergarten class. Upon learning of their mutual passion for classic rock music, the two bonded immediately.
“We might have been two of the only five year olds into classic rock,” Russell jokingly recalled.
A passion for music initially sparked their friendship, but it was a decision by their kindergarten teacher that would create a lifelong bond.
Dewey was diagnosed at an early age with cerebral palsy, a disability which permanently impairs muscle coordination. His diagnosis also required him to use a wheelchair for mobility. Of his classmates in kindergarten, only certain members were permitted to transport Patrick from class to class: Dewey made certain Jacob was the first classmate allowed to do so.
“The teacher knew that we were really good friends,” Dewey commented. “She knew this would be a good way of forming a bond.”
The two remained close throughout the years, yet their relationship became more difficult to maintain as the two entered high school. Russell began taking part in varsity athletics including sports such as wrestling, track and field, tennis, and cross country. Due to Patrick’s disability, he was no longer able to be with Jacob during these activites—a barrier the two had not yet encountered.
Russell was determined to find a way to be able to include his childhood friend in his new endeavours. It was in this pursuit that he stumbled upon the story of “Team Hoyt” in an article written by Sports Illustrated. A father and son team, Rick and Dick Hoyt have competed in 72 marathons together, 32 of those being Boston Marathons, despite Rick’s cerebral palsy.
Jacob was inspired.
“When I read about Team Hoyt, I just thought it would be a great way for us to do something together and for Patrick to be able to experience competition,” Russell said.
The pair have since competed in 15 races and two marathons together. The transition from individual racing to competing as a team has had its bumps though.
The team raced their first marathon together on a sweltering 90 degree sunny day in Poughkeepsie, New York. Midway through the race, Dewey’s footrest on his wheelchair began to come loose. Russell managed to trek on a few miles before the footrest began sparking against the ground. Upon multiple stops in order to repair the wheelchair with a roll of duct tape, Russell began cramping. Under normal circumstances, Russell might have let his physical limits get the best of him, but he pushed on for his best friend.
“Normally, if I was running by myself and my legs were in the condition they were due to the cramps and spasms, I might have just quit,” Jacob said. “It’s easy to say I can fail myself and cut my losses, but I couldn’t let Patrick down.”
Jacob, though, doesn’t rely on Dewey just for motivation. Still embracing their love for classic rock, during their races, Dewey hums hits from the pairs’ favorite artists such as Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, and Deep Purple in order to help Jacob endure the intense mental strain a marathon imparts on runners.
Russell has become so accustomed to running with his childhood companion, doing so without him feels unnatural. Due to the limited number of wheelchair racing tandem spots, Russell ran the Boston marathon without Dewey last year. While he remains proud of this accomplishment, he knew it wasn’t complete without his best friend by his side.
“It’s so much better to run with Patrick than individually,” Russell said. “It [the Boston Marathon] was cool to do and I got to say I did it, but I wasn’t satisfied with it in the end.”
The team is able to compete in this year’s marathon largely due to their support from The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp foundation, a program that provides fun, engaging camping excursions for children with disabilities. Dewey has been a part of the program since he was seven. Despite the team raising $10,000 for the charity, Dewey argues it is The Hole in the Wall Gang Camp that has given him the most.
“We really owe it to Hole in the Wall to allow us to be on their fundraising team and on their race day team,” Dewey said.
When searching for a charity to race for, the team discovered that The Hole in the Wall Gang was the ideal match for them. Not only did the team look to give back to an organization that has provided Dewey with so many opportunities, but both believe the foundation’s mission aligns with their own.
“It worked out really well with our mission which is to show that disabilities can’t stop people’s will for competition,” Russell said.
Although running a marathon is an incredible feat for anyone to accomplish, Russell has found a way to go above and beyond, running with a deeper purpose.
“Some people say that success in racing is just a blue ribbon,” Russell said. “But running with Patrick has taught me that success is more than just a blue ribbon. It’s doing something that is meaningful and that we can do together through persistence.”
Dewey will receive a degree in communications from Edinboro University, while Russell will graduate with a degree in history and government from Harvard University. For now though, accompanied by the sweet sound of Aerosmith, the two are just looking forward to completing the journey they began in kindergarten class so many years ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
We were so close, guys. USC. Stanford. Hell, even Yale – as if last weekend’s bashing from the batter’s box wasn’t enough. In the midst of the largest admissions bribery firestorm in collegiate history, it seemed like Harvard would emerge from the ashes scot-free, our sole offense being that one of the paid test-takers at the center of the scandal was a Harvard alum. But alas, our innocence was fleeting. Just as the Crimson was ready to saunter away from the quagmire that is Operation Varsity Blues, we were hit with an admissions scandal on our own front piste.
Now, nothing is definitive, and Harvard’s independent review into the allegations is still ongoing – but here’s what we know. In 2016, Crimson fencing coach Peter Brand’s Needham, Mass. home was bought by businessman Jie Zhao for almost $1 million, about $400 thousand over its market value. Zhao’s son, a fencer, was subsequently accepted to Harvard’s Class of 2021, where he proceeded to join the Crimson fencing team. Zhao then sold his newly-acquired home at about a $325K loss, having never lived in it himself.
A sketchy story? Certainly. Definitive proof of bribery? Perhaps.
Regardless of whether or not the real estate irregularity was carried out with malicious intent, the situation points to a much larger systematic concern – the victimization of college students, especially student-athletes. According to The Boston Globe, Zhao’s son had no clue about his father’s home transaction; he was left completely in the dark. Sound familiar? To anyone who’s been keeping up with the Varsity Blues news, it certainly should.
Almost all of the cases being brought forth by federal prosecutors follow the same pattern: a wealthy parent solicited the help of a notorious college counselor, who then, without their child’s knowledge, rigged testing results or bribed coaches to get that high schooler into college. Now, whether these students’ claims of ignorance are true is anyone’s guess – but regardless, they were victimized, their names forever blacklisted because of their parents’ actions. And if you are finding it difficult to feel bad for these wealthy students, keep in mind that because of the wrongdoings of authority figures, the names of these students will always be followed by an asterisk reading parents paid their way into college. These six words will almost certainly overshadow any academic achievement, any victorious fencing bout, any accomplishment that these implicated students achieve.
And then there’s the athletic side of things – not only does this scandal victimize students, but it speaks to a much larger pattern of coaches’ disregard for their most valuable assets: college athletes. Rick Pitino’s funneling of money from Adidas to his basketball players. The existence of “paper classes” for athletes at UNC. The Rajin’ Cajun’s falsification of its football players’ standardized testing scores. Yes, in all of these cases, student-athletes ended up on the wrong side of the scandal – but it was their coaches, their administrators, and their parents that put them there. This newest fencing controversy is the same story that has been told time and time again, in which a coach or other authority figure, in what are disguised as actions meant to benefit college athletes, end up instead marring students’ names.
Unless steps are taken to hold college coaches to a higher standard, this story is one that is destined to be repeated many more times. In the words of FAS Dean Claudine Gay, “where there are opportunities to clarify practices and strengthen procedures, we must act on them, and do so with a sense of urgency.” Harvard has already announced that its coaches will undergo training on the university’s conflict of interest policy – certainly a step in the right direction, but one that must be followed by a stride ten times as long. It is high time that authority figures, rather than the athletes over whom they wield authority, face the consequences of their actions. Until coaches become the standard bearers for, rather than victimizers of, college athletes, the somber sound of the varsity blues is a harmony that will continue to play on every field, every court, every piste.

On Sunday afternoon, students gathered in Tercentenary Theater for the College Events Board’s annual outdoor music festival Yardfest. The College made a series of changes to the event this year, including moving it from Friday evening to Sunday afternoon and instituting no-guest and no-re-entry policies.
Yardfest featured two student artists, Extra Extra and Maybe There’s Life, along with two headliners — pop artists Bazzi and Kiiara. Hundreds of students flocked to Harvard Yard to hear the performers, eat dinner, and spend time with friends throughout the four-hour event.


Lincoln A. Hart '21 of music collective Maybe There's Life — one of the student acts chosen to perform during Battle for Yardfest — performed part of an original rap song. The other student act, Extra Extra, also performed a number of original songs and covers before the featured performers took the stage.


The College Events Board introduced one of the headliners after the performances by student artists. Student members of the CEB helped choose the headliners, set up and swipe students into the venue in Tercentenary Theatre, and publicize the event.


While waiting for the headliners to perform, students helped themselves to dinner and refreshments set up by Harvard University Dining Services around the Yard, while others mixed and mingled. Some attendees played giant games including chess, checkers, and jenga that the CEB had set up around the perimeter of the event.


Pop singer and songwriter Kiiara, who was the concert’s opener this year, started with one of her hit songs, “Feels.” She performed a long set, including her songs “Messy” and “Heavy,” before closing with her debut single, “Gold,” which topped the Billboard charts at number 13 in 2015. The crowd screamed the lyrics while she sang.


Students danced during the annual Yardfest concert. The outdoor music festival was enhanced by spring weather, with the temperature peaking at 69 degrees on the Sunday afternoon.

 
Pop singer and songwriter Bazzi performed one of his songs, "Star," in front of a galaxy background as the light faded from Tercentenary Theatre Sunday evening.


Students danced to Bazzi's beats during the college-wide event, a rare chance to let loose amidst the bustle of everyday life as a student.


By the end of Yardfest, night had fallen. Students waved giant glow sticks and sang along as the the stage lights illuminated Bazzi from behind when he ended the concert with a performance of his hit single, "Mine."
