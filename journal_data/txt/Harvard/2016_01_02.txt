After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Stephen Silva, who provided Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev the gun used to kill an MIT police officer in 2013, was released last Tuesday after a federal judge ruled he had spent sufficient time in prison.
In his testimony, Silva said he lent Tsarnaev, a childhood friend, an illegal gun that Tsarnaev said he would use to rob drug dealers from Rhode Island. Instead, the firearm was used to kill MIT police officer Sean A. Collier a few days after the Boston Marathon bombings in April 2013.
Silva was arrested in July 2014 on counts of heroin trafficking and possession of a gun with a defaced serial number, and eventually pleaded guilty to his charges. Silva’s arrest was unrelated to the Boston marathon bombings.
In the recent ruling, U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf said he had reduced Silva’s sentence because of his willingness to cooperate with prosecutors during Tsarnaev’s trial earlier this year. Indeed, Silva’s testimony during the trial offered a counterargument to the defense’s claim that Tsarnaev’s older brother, Tamerlan, was responsible for the operation and acquired the gun himself.
Silva had already served 17 months since his arrest in July 2014.
Prosecutors said Silva was unaware of the brothers’ plan to bomb the 2013 marathon, and Silva told the judge he regretted his actions. He also told reporters he wanted to offer “his deepest condolences” to the Collier family.
In June, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was formally sentenced to death for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, which left three dead and hundreds wounded. Days after Tsarnaev and his brother set off two pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon’s finish line, police cars raced across Cambridge in pursuit of the brothers, leading to a shootout that left Tamerlan dead. A subsequent manhunt for Tsarnaev left much of the Boston area, including Harvard, on lockdown, and Tsarnaev was eventually captured in Watertown.
The office of Judge Mark L. Wolf declined to comment on the ruling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MINNEAPOLIS—The first line for the Harvard men’s hockey team is no stranger to making headlines. And rightfully so. For the second straight season, the Crimson’s star trio of Jimmy Vesey, Kyle Criscuolo, and Alex Kerfoot has wreaked havoc on its opponents, this time entering 2016 with 41 points through 10 games.
But in Harvard’s first contest of the new year Friday evening, it was the fourth line that stole the show. Entering Friday with a combined three points, Lewis Zerter-Gossage, Jake Horton, and Devin Tringale left with 10, as all three found the back of the net in a 7-3 rout of Ferris State in the opening round of the 25th annual Mariucci Classic.
“It’s awesome,” said Tringale, the junior whose second-period goal extended the Crimson’s lead to 5-2, all but squashing any hopes of a Bulldog comeback. “We put in a lot of work. From the first line to the fourth line, I thought we all played with a lot of energy tonight, and it’s nice to get rewarded for the hard work once in a while.”
Harvard (7-1-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) manhandled FSU over the first 15 minutes of play at the University of Minnesota’s holiday tournament, outshooting the Bulldogs (8-9-4, 7-7-2 WCHA) by a 20-3 margin over that span. But after winning a power play near the end of the frame, the FSU offense finally sprung to life, generating 16 of the game’s next 21 shots, including two goals—courtesy of its own fourth line, no less—to cut the Crimson’s lead to 4-2.
Momentum continued to turn in the Bulldogs’ favor less than 30 seconds later after freshman center Trevor Recktenwald scored their second goal, as senior defenseman Desmond Bergin drew one of three penalties he amassed in the period, leaving FSU with an opportunity to climb within one.
But the Bulldogs failed to take advantage, as sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen made two of his 34 saves in the contest on the ensuing power play to maintain his side’s two-goal edge. And with 2:30 remaining in the frame, Tringale provided the dagger, turning a Zerter-Gossage feed right above the crease into his first goal since Feb. 28, 2014.
“We’re not surprised,” said Kerfoot about the fourth line’s offensive outburst. “We see them in practice every day, and we know how good they are. Everyone in our lineup is a really good hockey player.”
Zerter-Gossage’s assist to Tringale provided the finishing touch on a career day for the rookie from Montreal. The freshman opened the scoring just over eight minutes into the contest with an impressive redirect of a Clay Anderson blue-line slapper and followed it up with a helper to Horton, who upped Harvard’s lead to 3-0 on a wrister near goaltender Charles Williams’s right post.
The Crimson exploded for a total of seven goals in the win, matching a season-high set in its season opener against Dartmouth on Halloween in Hanover. And just like in its rout of the Big Green, Harvard received its production from seven different goal-scorers.
After Zerter-Gossage was Vesey, who scored his ninth of the season from the edge of the right circle 12:42 into the contest after receiving a feed through the slot from Kerfoot as the junior darted his way up the left wing.
Then 1:45 into the third period, Seb Lloyd joined Tringale and Horton as the third member of the Crimson to score his first goal of the season on Friday. Collecting a Sean Malone shot that missed wide behind the net, Lloyd beat Williams on a wrap-around to up Harvard’s lead to four.
Eight minutes later, fifth-year senior Colin Blackwell—playing in his first game since Nov. 14 after missing the Crimson’s last six contests—capped his side’s scoring with a one-timer just north of the left dot that ricocheted off the left post and in.
Harvard’s victory, paired with a 3-2 Minnesota win over UConn in the nightcap, means that the Crimson and Gophers will square off in the championship game of the Mariucci Classic tomorrow night at 8 p.m. EST (7 p.m. CST).
An arena with a capacity of 10,000 people, Mariucci remained largely empty for the majority of the bout between Harvard and FSU, who calls Grand Rapids, Mich., home. But following the final whistle, the hometown fans flooded in to see the hosts play UConn in the second game of the night.
Knowing the type of atmosphere a championship game against Minnesota has the potential to draw, Kerfoot knew exactly who he was rooting for before the Gophers even took the ice.
“I want to play Minnesota. I mean we came all the way out here. I want to play at 7:00 in front of a packed house,” Kerfoot said.
“I mean if we play UConn, that’s fine—they’re a great team,” he added. “But...it’s not every time you get to come to Minnesota to play in the finals of the Mariucci against them. That’d be pretty special.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
MINNEAPOLIS—Alex Kerfoot has gotten his wish.
After the Harvard men’s hockey team knocked off Ferris State in the opening game of the 25th annual Mariucci Classic on Friday, most members of the Crimson stuck around for the nightcap between Minnesota and UConn, waiting to learn their championship game opponent.
But before the the Gophers and Huskies could even make it to the ice, Harvard’s top-line center made it clear who he wanted to see in the final.
“I want to play Minnesota. I mean we came all the way out here. I want to play at 7:00 in front of a packed house,” Kerfoot said.
“It’s not every time you get to come to Minnesota to play in the finals of the Mariucci against them,” he added. “That’d be pretty special.”
Surely enough, the Gophers (8-8-0, 3-1-0 Big 10) pulled through. Just 31 seconds after UConn (5-11-1, 3-7-1 Hockey East) tied the game at two early in the third period, junior forward Hudson Fasching answered with a goal of his own to launch the hosts into the finals for the first time since 2013.
Minnesota will be chasing its 14th Mariucci Classic title Saturday night (8 p.m. EST), but standing in the way of the current Big 10 frontrunners might be the best team the Gophers have seen all year, according to head coach Don Lucia.
“They’re very talented,” Lucia said of the Crimson. “It’s going to be one of those games where we better have everybody play well tomorrow to give ourselves a chance. We can’t have a couple lines not play well [against] as good a team like Harvard.”
The No. 7/7 Crimson (7-1-3, 4-1-3 ECAC) steamrolled Ferris State (8-9-4, 7-7-2 WCHA) in its first game of the tournament, as seven different players found the back of the net in a 7-3 victory. All four lines got in on the action, as Harvard received goals from all three members of the fourth line, co-captains Jimmy Vesey and Kyle Criscuolo on the first, the newly-returned Colin Blackwell on the second, and sophomore Seb Lloyd on the third.
“Our coach compared them to Michigan,” Fasching said. “They’ve got skilled forwards, [and] they’ve got guys that have ability and could come at us hard, so we’ve just got to be prepared for that.”
The comparison revolves around the two sides’ explosive offenses, as Harvard and No. 10/10 Michigan both rank among the top 10 nationwide in scoring. Nonetheless, as part of their recent string of success, the Gophers beat the high-flying Wolverines, 3-2, in Ann Arbor on Dec. 12. After getting out to a disappointing 4-7 start, Minnesota has now won four of its last five and can move above .500 for the first time this season with a win over the Crimson.
Fasching, an alternate captain playing on the second line, has played a big role in the Gophers’ tear. The Burnsville, Minn., native has scored in three straight games and four of the last five, putting him in the team lead with nine goals on the year.
Joining Fasching on the second line is sophomore left winger Leon Bristedt, who is tied with Fasching for the team lead in points with 15 (eight goals, seven assists). And centering the line is freshman Tommy Novak, a Nashville Predators draft pick who leads the Gophers with 10 assists on the year.
Including Novak, five freshman forwards were featured in Minnesota’s lineup on Friday, with at least one appearing on each line. The Gophers also have a rookie between the pipes in Eric Schierhorn, who has started every game for Minnesota this year.
In fact, only three players on this young Gopher roster were with the team when it last won the Mariucci Classic in 2013, and only one—senior fourth-liner A.J. Michaelson—received playing time that season. Thus, just about everyone taking the ice Saturday night will be chasing their first title in the historic holiday tournament.
This is the fourth time Harvard has participated in the Classic, but prior to Friday, the Crimson had been winless through six games at the tournament. Harvard will be chasing its second consecutive title in a holiday tournament, after having won the Shillelagh Tournament in South Bend, Ind., in November.
“If you can point out a couple big games or tournaments to highlight and get excited for, it helps with motivation and consistency throughout the year,” junior forward Devin Tringale said. “To win two tournaments in a row like this—it would be great, and it’s kind of what we expect out of ourselves with the caliber of team we have this year.”
A near-capacity crowd is expected for Saturday night’s championship bout at Mariucci Arena, which is capable of holding 10,000 people. But even in a hostile road environment, coming off its seven-goal outburst on the Olympic-sized ice, the Crimson enters its final game in Minneapolis as the likely favorite.
“We want to play good teams, I think our fans want to see us play good teams, and certainly Harvard’s one of those teams that’s going to be there right at the end of the year,” Lucia said. “The way they looked [last night], they look like a team that can win a national title.”

When you left high school and found out winter break at Harvard was 5+ weeks long, you were probably thrilled. Your whole life leading up to now you’ve been used to a solitary one week of break spanning exactly from Christmas Day to New Year’s Day, and thus couldn’t imagine the endless possibilities awaiting you during this glorious vacation time. But now you’re here. And sadly, Christmas is now over. You don’t even have getting drunk on New Year’s Eve to look forward to anymore. Most of your friends are probably going to head back to their schools in the next week or so. And you still have 3 long weeks of winter break left. You’re starting to get...dare I say it? BORED. If this is you, keep on reading because flyby has the solutions for you.
Redecorate Your Room
You’re a grown-up now and chances are your room decor might not reflect that. Take charge of your life and create the room you’ve always wanted for yourself. This is your opportunity to spend hours on Pinterest looking at great ways to transform your room, only to eventually abandon those plans for a much more minimal transformation following the reality check that a quick glance at your bank account gave you. This can be very time consuming and can be a great way to get to know yourself as a person, especially now that it’s #newyearnewme. Added bonus: this self reflection might even help you be all set to talk about yourself when you decide to get started filling out all those summer applications.
Note: Flyby is not liable for any angry reactions from parents if you take this too far.
Start a Craft
Finishing a project can bring you a sense of satisfaction you haven’t been able to experience through academics this past semester. Yes, it can be a feeling greater even than the joy that arises from successfully finishing all 8 seasons of a TV show on Netflix in a week. Plus, crafts can make great presents for friends or significant others. Or you know, just to hang in your dorm room if you’re lonely and single. (See Flyby Matchmaker for solution).
Plan for Spring or Summer Break
This option has at least two benefits. One, you’ll have the peace of mind of knowing what you’re doing with your life in the coming months and won’t have to scramble to find a job or internship with the guy your dad went to highschool with and talked to twice in his life. And two, in true Harvard fashion, you can start the, “Well I’m doing [insert opportunity that will literally never matter after you apply to graduate school] this summer.”

Learn How to Cook
While no one can deny that HUDS food is great, we all sometimes crave food that doesn’t just have a cold slice of cheese on top of it. And if you don’t want to break the bank and visit a Harvard Square business, you can now use your newly honed skills to prepare a non-microwaved meal. Along with being a great survival technique, cooking is also really fun. Once you get a little more experienced, you can start experimenting with stuff. Plus, you can play your favorite music and invite a friend to cook with you!
Workout
You no longer have any excuse to not workout. The “I have to (pretend to) write a paper” and “I should really catch up on sleep” excuses are a thing of 2015. It’s 2016 now, and you have almost a month to keep your New Year’s resolutions that you will undoubtedly forget as soon as you get back to school. So make one of them to be in better shape. After all, you’re going to need stamina and strength to run from class to class in the tundra that awaits us. Winter is coming kids. Even if it might not seem like it...
