After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“If I was who I was before, / Then I’d be waiting at your door,” Maggie Rogers begins “Give A Little,” the first song of her debut album, “Heard It In A Past Life.” It’s the first of many hypotheticals scattered throughout the album’s lyrics, as Rogers tends to write in the conditional tense. Sometimes she uses them to bargain: “If you leave the light on.” Other times, they express frustration: “If only I could give in / If I could get out.” Occasionally, they pose tentative questions: “If you’re giving up, would you tell me?” Mostly, they go unanswered, with no one on the other end to reply. But the one in “Give a Little” does the work of resolving itself right away: “But I cannot confess I am the same.”
“Everything has changed” is the evident subtext of “Heard It In A Past Life,” which references a transformative, life-altering shift in its own title. Perhaps this uncertainty explains why Rogers favors the conditional and the subjunctive — both tenses allow her to slip easily from one reality to the next. Indeed, a certain unreality accompanies the dramatic life shift that characterized Rogers’ overnight ascent to pop star status, ever since the fated day Pharrell Williams listened to a demo of Rogers’ song “Alaska” two years ago in a masterclass at NYU, when Rogers was a senior in college. Halfway through the first verse, Williams’ face morphed from impassive to stunned. By the first chorus, he was visibly moved to tears. “I have zero, zero notes for that,” he told her after the song ended. “I’ll tell you why. You’re doing your own thing. It’s singular.” The video of the masterclass, with over 3.2 million views to date, went viral, catapulting Rogers to the status of Internet sensation. The rest is history, told in the usual banalities of fame: A meteoric rise to stardom, a record deal with a major label, the use of the phrase “the rest is history” in articles just like this one.
For most aspiring musicians, that trajectory of instant prestige is the career equivalent of a golden ticket. But being thrust unexpectedly in the public eye is no fairy tale — there is no opt-out of Internet stardom, which comes with its own unforeseen traumas. If this story had happened to anyone less pragmatic or less patient, her celebrity might have dissipated after a few months; others like her, presented with the opportunity to sustain a livelihood out of one viral moment, have been known to succumb to burnout or fade into the ether. But “Heard It In A Past Life” is a testament to Rogers’ patient commitment to authenticity, both artistic and personal. Three years later, this confessional album is the long-awaited product of Rogers’ diligence and unyielding commitment to her aesthetic mission. And it is luminously, ridiculously, singularly good.
So what, exactly, is Rogers’ “it” factor? For one, her technical songwriting and mixing background translates into excellent production value, breaking boundaries as she experiments with unconventional combinations of eclectic genres. She blends folky, sound effect-heavy percussion (she’s known to integrate unconventional sound clips, like samples of finger snaps and mourning doves) and electro-synth chords that wouldn’t sound out of place at a dance club (inspired by a study abroad in Europe). On top of all this, Rogers transitions elegantly between an emotive middle register and an ethereal falsetto, each note resonating with a soulful vibretto.
On top of sonic mastery, “Heard It In A Past Life” also espouses a particular commitment to authenticity — a tricky term applied to records like this one, with so many industry veterans credited as producers alongside the singer herself. One frets this stacked production team might have borne a case of too many cooks in the kitchen, yet each track resonates with an authorial candor that feels uniquely her own, recapitulated from the bygone archives of her Bandcamp juvenilia. Rogers believes in, to quote one of her own manifestos, “the power of vulnerability.” The phrase seems, at first, oxymoronic — susceptibility as strength feels like a paradoxical equation — but like any adept songwriter, Rogers knows that emotional honesty is the currency of good art. Over the course of 12 tracks, some more confessional than others, she cleverly weaponizes vulnerability into frankness that disarms and empowers.
Rogers is a skilled conduit for emotion, translating sentiments into concise verse. Her lyrics reward close reading, without sacrificing melody or mangling prosody, as syntactically complex verses often do. Rogers pairs lyrics with mimetic, symbolic chord progressions. In “Alaska,” chorus oohs imitate shallow intakes of breath, while Rogers narrates, “inhaling” and “exhaling” in alternate lines. Verses in a minor key give way to major key choruses in “The Knife” with the suddenness of realization. “Overnight,” which thematizes rapid life change, features a repeated incantation. “I’m all right,” Rogers promises, more to herself than anyone else. “I’m still here.” The same repetition characterizes the anxiety and keenness of a new crush. “I couldn’t say it to myself / I couldn’t say it to myself,” she reiterates in “Say It.” Simple anecdotes, like a series of panic attacks in “Back In My Body” or the catharsis of nature in “Alaska,” connote weighty feelings that transcend the strictures of their telling.
Elsewhere, Rogers works as innovatively with more cerebral lyricism as she does simplicity (perhaps proof of an English degree made manifest). “The Knife” opens with the terse description of spontaneous awareness: “The knife of insight tore its way in me / A brash collision without sympathy.” As a songwriter, she dexterously handles double entendres. In one song, falling water works as a dual symbol, both helpless to gravity (“I’m like falling water, set me free”) while also an unstoppable force (“falling water, coming down on me”).
All of this is to say, Rogers is an incredibly talented musician, with instinctual storytelling facility to boot. The album exemplifies her ability as much as it also reveals a story pulsing beneath the ebullient folk-tronic percussion and layered metaphors. That story hints at a much fuller picture, one of a young artist struggling from darkness into the light. Perhaps that’s why the “viral Internet success” Cinderella story has always felt too tidy as a narrative. One can’t help but wonder whether the album is addressed from Rogers to herself — both as a battle cry and as a battle won, after an uncomfortable moment under scrutiny in the spotlight. “Come out of the darkness,” she coaxes in “Retrograde,” quoting “Bella Donna,” which Stevie Nicks wrote as a solo stint after exhausting years of heartbreak and band infighting, about a woman who “is so tired, so the woman disappears.” Rogers, returning from a similar disappearance, seems to harbor the same resignation at times. “I am finding out / There’s just no other way / that I’m still dancing at the end of the day,” she sings in “Light On.” Chances are, though, Maggie Rogers will be dancing for much longer than she thinks.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ali Farag ‘14, a three time first team All-American squash player while at Harvard, rallied back from two games down to defeat World No. 1 Mohamed el Shorbagy at the 2019 J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions in New York City on Thursday.
When the new rankings come out in March, the 26-year-old will overtake el Shorbagy and become the top-ranked squash player for the first time in his career.
The match was tight throughout, with el Shorbagy’s thrilling 12-10 win in the first game setting the tone. It was only fitting that it went the full five game distance, although the final point ended in inglorious fashion.
El Shorbagy — the tournament’s champion in 2015 and 2016 — called for a review on a shot that Farag deemed unreturnable because his opponent occupied the space in front of him. Farag won the review, embraced his fellow Egyptian, and raised his arms to the sky, seemingly in disbelief.
After becoming the No. 1 ranked junior player in the world and then spending his freshman season at American University in Cairo, Farag joined the Crimson and was immediately dominant. He played from the No. 1 position for three consecutive years and won two CSA individual national championships with a semifinal finish in his junior season.
In Farag’s senior season, Harvard had perhaps its best squash season ever. With the Egyptian leading the team, the Crimson went undefeated and won 12 of its 18 matches by 9-0 scores. Three of those unblemished wins came in the team’s CSA team championship matches as Harvard won its first Potter Cup since 1998 in decisive fashion. Farag swept Trinity in the national championship game, 3-0 (11-1, 11-5, 11-5), to conclude his Crimson career.
Farag’s influence on Harvard squash has gone beyond the time he spent playing for the Crimson. He became the pioneer of Egyptian squash at Harvard, convincing junior Saadeldin Abouaish to come stateside. Five years after Farag graduated, there are now four Egyptian squash players on the Crimson, two men and two women.
Given the impact Farag has had on Harvard’s squash program, it is no surprise that the current team, which is 6-0 and has throttled teams by a combined 54 games to three, watched his showdown with el Shorbagy with bated breath and erupted when he won the match. The feeling, apparently, is mutual. The champion, who still wears an H on his back during matches, tweeted a simple response to his Crimson successors’ elation:

In the five days following Christmas, the Harvard baseball team left behind the mistletoe and eggnog to travel to the Dominican Republic for a trip that proved to transcend baseball.
“It was an amazing opportunity,” said coach Bill Decker. “It was really a tremendous experience — baseball was obviously part of that experience — but I think the more meaningful things might have been everything we did off the field.”
“We really packed a lot into those couple of days,” added sophomore pitcher Chris McGrory. “Each day, we played a game and then did some sort of community service.”
Over the course of the trip, the team participated in various community outreach projects, from painting a house in an impoverished village to visiting a local orphanage. The time spent playing with the children at the Casa de Amor orphanage was especially meaningful for the Crimson squad.
“The orphanage was probably the most impactful part of the trip for me,” said McGrory. “To see the fun that the girl I met, Maria Luisa, had with a slide and an inflated ball reminded me of the relative unimportance of material goods.”
“It was powerful; it was really powerful,” noted Decker about the experience. “When you look at your teammate with the child he’s teamed up with, and he looks at you with the youngster you’re teamed up with, it’s really meaningful. And for me, it was really awesome to watch our guys and their interactions with the kids.”
Positive interactions with members of the community extended onto the baseball field as well, as Harvard matched up against three Dominican teams: the Dominican Army, the LBL Allstars, and Paulino Academy. The Crimson fell to the Dominican Army and beat the LBL Allstars and the Paulino Academy team, but what was more important was the camaraderie with the Dominican ballplayers.
“There was a healthy, friendly competition on the field,” Decker said. “But through other interactions like the lunches that we had afterwards, [our players] really got to know who they were. After the game, it was picture-after-picture, getting to know some of the players from the other squad.”
“[The Dominican teams] played with great energy and passion,” added McGrory. “They had a really stress-free and loose style of play, one that I hope we can take back to Ivy League play. They played very confidently, and were just having fun with everything they did on the field.”
The matchup against the LBL Allstars stood out in particular due to the venue — a local field that proved that passion for the game is much more important than the quality of the dirt.
“The playing surfaces weren’t great,” Decker had to say, “but the atmosphere was there. The atmosphere was there.”
“The game was in an awesome environment — a village ballpark — and the whole neighborhood came out to watch the game,” added McGrory. “There was a ton of energy, a ton of passion.”
The competition was top-notch as well, and served as good preparation for the season as the team began the early stages of training.
“We played against three teams that were loaded with former minor leaguers and major leaguers,” Decker said. “There were also the guys that were coming up, some young kids that are going to be signed for quite a bit of money. I thought we trained fairly well — our guys did a particularly nice job in the second two games — and while we never over-extended anybody, the training that they did was awesome.”
Beyond the physical training that came with three days of baseball and one sunrise workout on the beach, the team experienced the mental and emotional training of becoming one unit.
“The things that we did down there were collectively team bonding things,” Decker said. “We were trying to create a culture where guys can invest in each other.”
“I think that getting outside of our comfort zone is going to make us a much closer team, both now and come springtime,” McGrory said. “When we face challenges during the season, it’s good that we got to know each other outside of the everyday Harvard life of baseball and academics.”
Coach Decker summed up the trip quite simply: “I thought our guys did a nice job on the field, but I thought they were fantastic off the field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men's hockey team hasn't won both games in a weekend all season. On Saturday night, the Crimson has a chance to change that. After having stymied Clarkson in overtime the day before, Harvard (9-6-3, 6-5-2 ECAC) faces league bottom-feeders St. Lawrence (3-19-1, 1-9-1), a team that has not won a contest since Dec. 7.
The Crimson swept the Saints last year, once in a 4-3 overtime result and once in a resounding 5-0 decision at home. In addition to a weekend sweep, the team has another thing to look forward to tonight: co-captain Michael Floodstrand (99 GP, 9–19—28) is playing in his 100th career game.
