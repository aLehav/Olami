After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cambridge’s crime total hit a five-year high in 2021 with 2,598 serious crimes reported, according to the Cambridge Police Department’s annual crime analysis.
The report — created by CPD’s Crime Analysis Unit and releasd last Friday — reflected spikes in reported hate crimes, drug overdoses, rapes, larcenies, and auto thefts, among other crimes. The increase marks the second year in a row in which crime totals rose, following an 8 percent increase in 2020 on the heels of a 50-year record low in 2019.
Despite the rise in serious crimes reported, incident totals remain lower than in previous decades: Prior to 2014, the total had not fallen below 3,000 crimes in any year for which data is available.
Crime in Cambridge also continues to fall below national averages: The analysis showed that Cambridge reported nearly 1,000 fewer serious crimes than an average of cities with comparable populations in 2020, the most recent year available.
Across all drug types, Cambridge saw 351 reported overdoses and 35 deaths, its highest total in at least a decade. Of these deaths, 34 involved the use of opioids, per the report. Massachusetts is experiencing an opioid crisis that only continues to grow despite health and safety measures, reaching an all-time high in opioid-related fatalities in 2021.
A special report on drug overdoses showed record highs in reported opioid overdoses, both fatal and non-fatal.
Larceny and auto theft made up the majority of the increase from 2020, with 74 additional larceny incidents and 45 additional auto thefts reported in 2021. In particular, 95 additional larcenies from motor vehicles were reported as compared to 2020, for a total 0f 446. According to the report, this was primarily due to thefts of catalytic converters: a component that reduces vehicles’ carbon emissions, primarily targeted for its precious metal content.
According to the Boston Globe, CPD receives a call about catalytic converter theft almost every day — reflecting a regional trend so severe that the Massachusetts legislature is exploring a bill intended to stymie the thefts. The department issued an advisory in January 2022 warning residents about a string of catalytic converter thefts concentrated in northern Cambridge.
The report noted that while auto thefts rose in 2021, levels remain “staggeringly low” when compared to 20th-century highs — in 1974, over 5,000 cars were reported stolen in Cambridge, compared to 129 in 2021. About 40 percent of vehicles reported stolen in 2021 have since been recovered, according to the department’s analysis.
Incidents of reported fraud fell precipitously in 2021, with less than half as many cases as in 2020 — a change from 1,376 to 628 reports. Per the department’s analysis, this drop is primarily due to a decrease in fraudulent unemployment claims — categorized as a form of identity theft — which spiked at the pandemic’s height.
Robbery and burglary remained close to historical lows, with 68 and 197 incidents in 2021, respectively. There were no bank robberies reported in Cambridge during 2021, per the analysis — down after a rash of four in November and December 2020, two of them in Harvard Square. Harvard Square was struck by three bank robberies in the spring of 2022.
Thirty-six rapes were reported in Cambridge throughout 2021, the city’s highest recorded total since at least 1993, the earliest publicly available record on CPD’s website. Of these, nearly half were committed by acquaintances, while incidents involving strangers remain “extremely low,” according to the report.
Hate crimes also spiked in Cambridge across 2021, with 35 total incidents reported — the highest since at least 2004 and more than double 2020’s total of 15. Race and ethnicity-related hate crimes made up the majority of this increase, with 15 additional incidents taking place compared to 2021.
Two Harvard affiliates reported they were targeted by anti-Asian hate crimes in the spring of 2021, part of a pattern of escalating violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders around the country sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the report, there was no distinct pattern to the hate crimes which took place in Cambridge, and nearly all were unrelated incidents.
In an email, CPD spokesperson Jeremy C. Warnick wrote that the department would use the report’s analysis to better allocate police resources, particularly those aligned with social justice.
“By providing specific services to residents in the community who would be better served through a social justice approach than what could be afforded to them through a conventional criminal justice approach, CPD hopes to ultimately address any underlying issues and best support the short and long-term health and success of our residents,” Warnick wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 80 percent of Harvard faculty respondents characterized their political leanings as “liberal” or “very liberal,” according to The Crimson’s annual survey of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in April.
A little over 37 percent of faculty respondents identified as “very liberal”— a nearly 8 percent jump from last year. Only 1 percent of respondents stated they are “conservative,” and no respondents identified as “very conservative.”
The Crimson distributed its survey to more than 1,100 members of the FAS and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, polling tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty on their demographics, academic life, and viewpoints on other issues, including Harvard governance.
The 111-question survey garnered 476 responses, including 333 that were complete and 143 that were partially filled out. The anonymous survey, a link to which was emailed to nearly every member of the FAS, was open from April 11 to April 26. The Crimson did not adjust the data for possible selection bias.
The first, second, third, and fourth installments of The Crimson’s 2022 faculty survey explored faculty views on sexual harassment, Covid-19 response, tenure, and University governance, respectively. This fifth and final installment examines the political leanings of the faculty and their positions on Harvard’s responses to climate change and the Ukrainian crisis.
When asked whether they would support increasing ideological diversity among faculty by hiring more conservative-leaning professors, only a quarter of respondents were in support. In contrast, 31 percent opposed hiring conservative professors to increase ideological diversity, while 44 percent of respondents said that they neither supported or opposed it.
Just over half of faculty respondents supported extra vetting for former Trump administration officials seeking appointments within the FAS, but a plurality opposed barring them entirely from these positions.
Around 56 percent of surveyed faculty indicated they strongly or somewhat support greater screening, while 19 percent of surveyed faculty are strongly or somewhat opposed to it. Nearly a quarter indicated they neither support nor oppose it.
More than 40 percent of surveyed faculty, however, disagreed that Trump administration officials should be barred from receiving appointments within the FAS altogether. On the other hand, 30 percent of respondents indicated they support barring former Trump officials from FAS positions, and 29 percent neither support nor oppose.
Last September, Harvard announced it will allow its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire, putting it on the path to eventually divest from the industry.
Since its founding in 2012, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard has been advocating for Harvard to pull its fossil fuel investments, holding numerous protests and taking legal action against Harvard. Fossil fuel divestment activists with Harvard Forward, an alumni campaign, also gained seats on governance boards in 2020 and 2021.
Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow has not publicly announced a timeline for the University’s withdrawal from fossil fuel industry investments.
A vast majority of faculty supported Harvard’s decision to wind down its investments in the fossil fuel industry, with 67 percent strongly supporting and 21 percent somewhat supporting the move.
However, 57 percent answered that they either somewhat or strongly disagree that Harvard is “doing enough to fight climate change.”
When asked to give feedback on Harvard’s climate action, many faculty respondents called for bolder action and more transparency about its plans.
One faculty respondent said the University could have made a more “fulsome, positive commitment to divest” but has not shown an interest in anything other than “maximizing return on investment.”
“It is a good step,” the faculty member wrote. “But [it’s] a belated step, executed in the most cowardly manner possible, which removes much of its teeth.”
A few faculty respondents said any action Harvard makes to divest from the fossil fuel industry will not make a significant impact on the state of climate change overall, while others argued that Harvard has no moral obligation to divest.
In addition to questions about climate change, the survey also polled the FAS two months after Russia initially invaded Ukraine on Harvard’s response to the war.
Four days after the invasion, Bacow denounced Russian Vladimir Putin’s “wanton aggression” and pledged to spread awareness and “speak against cruelty.” The Office of the Vice Provost for International Affairs also posted a list of resources on its website for affiliates affected by the crisis.
In March, a group of Ukrainian, Russian, Belarusian, Kazakh, and American students garnered more than 650 signatories in a petition asking for academic and mental health support, financial aid, and immigration assistance. Two organiers said they did not receive a response from Harvard. University spokesperson Jason A. Newton had declined to comment on the petition.
In an April interview, Bacow defended Harvard’s response to the Ukrainian crisis, saying Harvard has “done a lot to try and help people understand where we’re at, the resources that we've made available to students.”
A majority of faculty respondents — 54 percent — neither agreed nor disagreed that Harvard has “adequately responded” to the ongoing war in Ukraine, with 26 percent supporting Harvard’s efforts. Meanwhile, 19 percent indicated they thought Harvard’s response was inadequate.
When asked for feedback on measures the University has taken in response to the crisis, many faculty wrote that they were unaware of such a response from Harvard.
Some respondents criticized what they saw as the bias in Harvard’s support for foreign countries in crisis. One of them called the University’s response “biased.”
“Why the outpouring of support for Ukraine but not other global humanitarian disasters (most of which occur in countries in the Global South)?” the faculty member wrote.
Other faculty members claim that Harvard is lagging behind its peer institutions in its support for displaced scholars. A few respondents said they did not believe Harvard should assume a political position in the geopolitical conflict.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
For its 2022 Faculty Survey, The Crimson collected electronic responses through Qualtrics, an online survey platform, from April 11 to 26, 2022. A link to the anonymous survey was sent to 1,182 FAS and SEAS faculty members through emails sourced in March 2022 from Harvard directory information. The pool included individuals on Harvard’s Connections database with FAS affiliations, including tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty.
Of those faculty, 492 faculty members accessed the link, and 476 participants answered at least one question. A total of 333 participants fully completed the survey.
To check for potential response bias, The Crimson compared respondent demographics with publicly available information on faculty demographics provided by the University — information regarding gender, race and ethnicity, SEAS affiliation, and ladder versus non-ladder status. Overall, the respondents to the survey were in line with the demographics of the broader faculty.
Of survey respondents, 42 percent identified themselves as women, and 25 percent identified themselves as faculty of color. Based on data in the 2021 FAS Dean’s Annual Report, women and faculty of color make up 39 and 26 percent of FAS faculty, respectively.
According to the report, 42 percent of the FAS are senior non-ladder, non-ladder, or visiting faculty. Among the respondents to The Crimson’s faculty survey, 49 percent indicated that they are non-ladder faculty.
Of faculty who were sent the link to the survey, 140 — or 12 percent — are affiliated with SEAS. In comparison, of respondents who indicated their divisional affiliation on the survey, 7 percent reported an affiliation with SEAS.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Management Company advocated for new environmental disclosure rules under consideration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, while pushing back against the proposal’s broadest reporting mandate in a letter to the SEC.
In a letter to SEC Secretary Vanessa A. Countryman on June 6, HMC Chief Compliance Officer Kathryn I. Murtagh wrote that HMC supports the proposed requirement that publicly-traded companies disclose emissions data and other climate-related financial information.
“We have known for quite some time that climate change poses significant risks to both individual businesses and the financial system as a whole,” Murtagh wrote. “Disclosure of material, climate-related financial information by corporations is essential for investors to be able to identify and manage climate risks effectively.”
The proposed regulations, released March 21, would require all companies registered with the SEC to provide information annually on climate-related risks to their business, including their greenhouse gas emissions. As an investor, HMC would have access to these environmental reports.
The new rule would also mandate the release of financial data detailing the economic impact of efforts to transition to carbon neutrality, as well as climate-related events, such as flooding and wildfires.
In her letter, Murtagh endorsed the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions categorized as Scope 1 and Scope 2 — but cautioned against a mandate on disclosing emissions in Scope 3.
Scope 1 incudes direct emissions from sources controlled by an company; Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from the purchase of energy; and Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions in a company’s chain of production.
Murtagh wrote that while the requirement is reasonable for companies with self-set goals of reducing Scope 3 emissions, it may prove unfeasible for others.
“We urge the commission to exercise caution before adopting a broad-based requirement for Scope 3 emissions,” the letter reads. “We believe that the difficulties in obtaining the necessary data from third parties and methodological uncertainties around calculating Scope 3 emissions are real and could make the required materiality determination quite costly for registrants.”
Some activists have since criticized HMC’s position on Scope 3 emissions. In a June 21 Twitter thread, Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard called the letter an attempt at “lobbying against any teeth for the policy.”
“Thousands of investors and financial experts recently called for the SEC to mandate corporate carbon emission transparency,” the group wrote. “And then there was @Harvard, lobbying on behalf of corporations seeking to hide their full carbon footprint.”
HMC previously wrote to the SEC last summer, in June 2021, supporting increased environmental disclosure requirements, calling current voluntary disclosures insufficient to understand climate risks. In those proposed guidelines, though, HMC recommended that the SEC “consider a limited number of mandatory disclosures,” naming only Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as metrics that should be required.
The June 2022 letter comes amid a transition of the University’s endowment — valued at $53.2 billion as of 2021 — to greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050. Following years of public pressure, HMC committed to allowing all its remaining investments in the fossil fuel industry to expire, effectively divesting the University’s endowment from fossil fuels, in November 2021. HMC reported in February that its internal operations are set to be carbon neutral for the fiscal year 2022.
Yevgeny Shrago — the climate policy director at Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy nonprofit — said while the latest HMC letter “captures the right things” in its overall support of the proposal, its argument that the Scope 3 requirement would be overly burdensome is “puzzling.”
“If companies are already doing it, the hardest work has already been done,” Shrago said. “New disclosing companies, that’s an incremental addition, they just have to onboard suppliers, build additional information about customers.”
Shrago also noted that the SEC’s proposal includes provisions that would make emissions disclosure easier by allowing the use of estimates where exact data is too costly or difficult to obtain. The new rule would also allow for Scope 3 emissions to be presented as a range, rather than an exact figure.
“A registrant may use reasonable estimates when disclosing its [greenhouse gas] emissions as long as it also describes the assumptions underlying, and its reasons for using, the estimates,” the proposed rule reads.
Madison E. Condon, a professor of environmental law at Boston University, also noted that the Greenhouse Gas Protocol includes a detailed guide for calculating emissions based on standard information that most businesses already track.
Condon wrote in an email that the proposal will be a “very strong rule” even if the Scope 3 requirement is limited to companies who have already committed to reducing those emissions.
“Many companies have announced targets or choose to report Scope 3 already, and would therefore be covered anyway,” she wrote. “And the rest of the rule is just as, or more, important as emissions — getting financial statements aligned with sustainability claims and goals, this is all very important.”
Connor Chung ’23, a member of Divest Harvard, said he thought it was “profoundly strange” for HMC to recommend against the required disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, as it would not require them to provide any information to the SEC.
“Harvard Management Company wouldn’t really need to lift a finger as the reporting burden is on corporations,” Chung said. “It’s baffling why Harvard would be wanting less information that, for most companies, makes up a majority of their greenhouse gas emissions.”
HMC declined a request for comment, referring back to its letters to the SEC.
Shrago — who was actively involved with Harvard Forward, a student and alumni campaign that promotes climate consciousness and increased transparency on the University’s governing boards — said that HMC’s opposition to Scope 3 disclosure suggests a reluctance to fully consider the carbon impact of its investments.
“They’re worried that once they have that data, they’re gonna have to use it,” Shrago said.
