After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Arthur the aardvark and his friends made their television debut in 1996, the same year that most current freshmen were born. Side by side, the PBS cartoon animals and members of the Class of 2018 learned how to read, make friends and tackle more difficult issues, including dealing with bullies and reaching for personal success. Indeed, countless stories in The Crimson over the past few years have pinpointed the “type A” personalities, high stress levels and need for perfection ingrained in many college students today.
While “Arthur” originated as a book series by author/illustrator Marc Brown, the television platform was critical in enabling the characters to explore their identities through movement, monologues and, most significantly, music. In fact, two musical interludes presented in “Arthur” give insight into the workaholic, ambition-driven tendencies of many students of this generation. The first, “Library Card,” features jazzy beats and a catchy refrain that will stick in one’s head for weeks (or even months). “Having fun isn't hard, / When you've got a library card,” Arthur and his classmates—a motley crew of bunnies, mice and other shrews/rodents/people—chant loudly and infectiously more than a dozen times throughout the song. This line becomes a mantra, one that viewers not only internalize via its incessant, upbeat repetition, but also bring to the outside by acquiring library cards of their own.
In this way, “Library Card” conditions the viewer to accept the library as a space for reading (fun!), perusing books for leisure (fun!) and general fun (fun!). Throughout the song, the show’s characters name drop authors including Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Ray Bradbury and stories including “The Giving Tree," "Jumanji," and "Where the Wild Things Are" to encourage the viewer to reach beyond his or her reading level, try new genres and always keep reading. As one character sings, “I could stay in this place / For hours and hours.” The library, introduced as “the” place to be, remains the place to stay for as long as possible, as work and play collide.
Now that the show has taught its audience that work always equates with fun, it goes a step further and transforms how the audience member should view her workload as a means for personal achievement. In a reggae-laced song, “Lucky Pencil,” protagonist Arthur details the discovery of said writing utensil and the subsequent neuroses he develops for fear of losing the magic graphite wand. Since using the pencil, Arthur’s success in school has skyrocketed. “I used it once, / And got an A in math, /  Then I got an A in history,” he gloat-sings over the relaxed and bouncy brass background music, which feels too low key for Arthur’s tightly-wound desire for accomplishment. In fact, Arthur feels so linked to the me-culture of ambition that he simply forbids his friends to use the pencil. When they intone, “Can we use it?” he replies immediately, “No. No. No.” This exchange occurs twice and is interspersed throughout, as Arthur focuses on his goal of “not one single mistake” and the fear that “my luck will run out /  When that pencil is gone,”  anxieties that hit close to home for many students. Members of our generation, perhaps, developed personal needs for academic perfection and some sort of “lucky” token object or pre-exam ritual as a consequence of watching Arthur do the same.
By the end of “Lucky Pencil,” however, Arthur has whittled down the pencil to “a nub” and can no longer use it for his tests. Though Arthur’s internal tension and compulsive behavior to write with the pencil only when absolutely necessary has been rising with this realization, the background music continues its stress-free and almost tropical patter—the resultant dissonance makes Arthur seem all the more crazed, as the upbeat melody belies his tightly-wound nature. Arthur ultimately faces his demons when the pencil is unusable and he must take a test without it.  “I took a test without it, /  And the very next day, / Found out with no lucky pencil, /  I still got an A  / It was me and not the pencil, / Without doubt  / I feel so lucky /  To have found this out,” he, once again, brags. Arthur, your serious A-mania—ambition, As, aardvarkness—has influenced a generation of students, pencil or no.
In terms of IQ learning, children will find a way to the library with or without “Arthur,” but “Arthur” was effective in introducing the library through both drama and music, elements which supplemented what the library would be like when a child gets there and which reinforced that it is a great place to be.
What “Arthur” touched upon more successfully in “Lucky Pencil” was the emotional intelligence side of learning. The dramatization and music, which showed how nothing bad happened to Arthur without his lucky pencil, enabled children to see for themselves that  Arthur still could get an A without a totem. It would have been very difficult for words alone, either from an adult’s talking or from just a song, to convince a child that it would be okay to let go of obsessive compulsive behavior.
Most people agree that the rise of digital entertainment has shortened our attention spans. And most people agree that there is nothing wrong with educational entertainment in moderation. What we cannot overlook, however, is that music can convince both young and old to follow a strict agenda. Let’s just hope that “Lucky Pencil” is helping our generation balance emotional intelligence and more wrote success.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Forty-nine years ago this past Saturday, President Lyndon Johnson delivered a speech at his alma mater, Southwest Texas State College, before signing into law the Higher Education Act of 1965. Johnson took the opportunity to recall his years as a student, when he had to work his way through school. Then, he reflected on his first job, as a teacher.
“I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School,” he said. “And I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor.
And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this Nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.”
Fortunately, thanks to programs created by the Higher Education Act, college is now within reach for far more Americans. When Johnson delivered his remarks, about 45 percent of new high school graduates attended college. In 2009, 70 percent did. That number, however, has since declined, and last year stood at about 66 percent.
This decrease is a sign that the way we pay for college is still flawed. As economist Heidi Shierholz said in an interview with the New York Times, “It’s another part of the long-term scarring process of the Great Recession that has been partly hidden.” When the economy struggles, the prospect of college dims for American students–largely because college means significant debt.
Recently, the crisis surrounding student loans has received more attention, and not just from the cause’s main crusader, Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Treasury Department, hardly Senator Warren’s biggest ally against the student loan industry, is now anxious that student loan debt has what Bloomberg terms “worrying similarities to the U.S. housing-market bubble.”
That concern highlights the trouble with having $1.3 trillion of unpaid student loans weighing on the economy. As the Huffington Post put it, “The more money that households devote to paying off student loans, the less they have to buy houses, start small businesses or save for retirement.” Moreover, “A recent survey by the Federal Reserve revealed that nearly half of Americans said they had to curb their spending last year in order to make payments on student loans.”
In short, the United State needs to reboot its model of financing higher education. Writing in the New York Times last month, Eduardo Porter discussed several policies the U.S. could pursue that would reduce costs for students, and potentially reign in its average yearly tuition, enormous by rich-world standards. As in many arenas, we have some things to learn from our parent democracy across the pond.
First, “the British government imposes tight quality controls to make sure higher education is up to scratch.” That way, it avoids spending money on degrees not likely to lead to what the U.S. Department of Education terms “gainful employment.”  For-profit colleges in the U.S. are particularly guilty of awarding less-than-useful degrees, and the government has already started to improve its record on this score. Consistent and continuing public relations and regulatory pressure will be crucial to reigning in costs and ensuring that higher education fulfills its promise of social mobility.
A second advantage of the British system is that students are only required to “pay back…9 percent of their annual earnings over £21,000 ($34,000).” Notably, this percentage is similar to the upper limit that the Affordable Care Act says Americans at or below 400 percent of the poverty level should expend on health insurance. As Porter notes, “the Obama Administration is moving, timidly, in this direction” on student loans.
Finally, the British cap university tuition. This regulation is likely a pipe dream, particularly after last week’s elections. Getting the Federal government to refinance student loan proved hard enough in a nominally Democratic Senate.
The British system is not without its flaws. Tuition increases have raised concerns about affordability and debt, and funding changes have disproportionately targeted humanities programs. Overall, however, it represents a more equitable model for making college affordable, and some current problems may require only relatively minor course corrections.
The idea that college should be available to all Americans is not one we can give up on. A recent op-ed in The Crimson made a strong argument for eliminating tuition at Harvard and other wealthy schools. But in 1965, President Johnson set the bar even higher. He urged his audience to remember “that that the leadership of your country believes it is the obligation of your Nation to provide and permit and assist every child born in these borders to receive all the education that he can take.”
That obligation is yet to be fulfilled in whole, but concrete steps towards that goal are clearly possible. All that we need now is the political will.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A few weeks ago, I heard about an event organized at my alma mater by Student Labor Action Movement—a group that has advocated for immigrants' and workers’ rights, and one that meant a lot to me during my time at Harvard. Now, SLAM was calling for our administration to cut ties with Teach For America. As an alum of both Harvard and Teach For America, and as a Chicana proud of having grown up in East Los Angeles, the child of two Mexican immigrant parents, I feel it is my responsibility to share my thoughts.
While the root causes of poverty are complex, for my family, education was the path out of it. My mother was the first in our family to attend college. One of ten children, she graduated from Roosevelt High in East Los Angeles, attended her local Cal State University, and became an educator—a role she has served in for 30 years. As a teacher, my mom had the know-how to set her own children up for success in school. Because she’d advocated to have us tested for gifted programs early on, for example, we were tracked into honors classes through middle school, and AP classes thereafter. In this way, my mom was my first great teacher. But she would not be my last.
As a student, I was lucky enough to have many terrific teachers—individuals who believed in my abilities, despite what society said about the unlikelihood of my academic success due to the color of my skin. They were teachers who challenged me with rigorous material, worked diligently to provide the supports that would enable me to meet their high expectations, and always dreamed bigger for me than I did for myself. With their support, I graduated at the top of my class and was admitted to Harvard.
Though a top performer at my school, I arrived on campus underprepared. But through the same grit and perseverance my educators had nurtured in me, I rose to the new challenge. And I thrived. As graduation approached, I made my own decision to join Teach For America because I knew that I wanted to be an advocate for kids who faced similar challenges to my own; what better way to do it than become a teacher myself?
All of this brings me back to the puzzling logic laid out by a group I once rallied alongside in pursuit of justice. According to SLAM, TFA undermines public education. They argue that attracting more teachers to the profession hurts it. They argue that if colleges like Harvard eliminate TFA as an option for its graduates, students in those communities are better off. They throw out terms like “neoliberal” and “privatization” without attending to the very real, very damaging impacts their demands would have if met.
Every day, our country defaults on the promise of equal educational opportunity, chronically under-serving communities like the one where I grew up. To change this, we should be asking how to create more path-changing learning opportunities like the ones I had. We should be thinking about how to attract the very best into teaching, supporting all teachers to fulfill their potential so students can fulfill theirs. We should be celebrating every effort to get more minds thinking about how to address educational injustice. Outstanding teachers come from all backgrounds, and I am grateful to the opportunity Teach For America provided me to serve my own community as an educator—and now as an educator coach. TFA allowed me to work alongside a diverse, inspiring force of teachers and advocates fighting to end educational inequity. Through it, I’ve had the great privilege of leading a classroom of my own, one full of passionate, talented, low-income students of color whose potential runs deep, yearning to be unleashed.
I deeply respect SLAM’s efforts to fight for economic justice by seeking better working conditions for workers, wage increases, health-care benefits, and unionization—this is why I supported the group’s efforts in my years as an undergrad. After all, the workers they advocate for are often the parents, guardians, and relatives of our students. And so I wonder why SLAM would advocate against a program doing so much to serve the children of these families: children who will most likely become low-income wage workers unless we disrupt an education system perpetuating the systemic oppression of such marginalized communities.
Every day, I give thanks for my teachers, for the veteran educators and visionary school leaders I lock arms with, for the parents, neighbors, and community allies who work tirelessly to ensure that our students and families have the supports they need, and for each and every teacher committed to serving children with backgrounds like mine across the country.
To have any shot at making their work count, we must stop these attacks and refocus on what it will take to support and learn from each other as we all work to give students the opportunities they need. Just as we demand and hope for the best from our kids, let’s demand the best from each other: an open, honest, and productive dialogue on how we can collectively deliver on that unfulfilled promised of educational excellence for all. Together—and only together—we can give our students the futures they deserve.

UPDATED: November 10, 2014, at 7:36 p.m.
When our professors speak in one voice, we should take notice. Last week, members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved by unanimous vote a complaint against the University’s new health benefits policy for non-union employees. These changes, which will introduce deductibles and a co-insurance model, were inaugurated with little discussion and scant justification. They have raised serious concerns among professors, who worry about how the policy will affect them, their families, and other staff. The University is more than a corporation, and it should not behave otherwise. Though the open enrollment period for next year’s health plans has already begun, the administration should scrap the changes and respond substantively to FAS concerns.
The University claims its plans are intended to reduce its health-care spending and encourage employees to consume services more wisely. Under the new system, employees would pay deductibles of up to $250 an individual and $750 for a family. They would be responsible for 10 percent of their own expenses–up to a cap of $1,500 for an individual, and $4,500 for a family–for non-routine, non-preventive care. For the first time, the University would also offer health-savings accounts to employees who wanted to opt out of traditional forms of coverage.
History professor Mary D. Lewis, the sponsor of the motion adopted by FAS, has called these measures “regressive.” She and others argue the health benefits change burdens junior faculty and those with pre-existing conditions. While we cannot evaluate those claims, we agree that Harvard must do its best to shield sick and lower-rank employees from the impact of cost-containment. We also think it significant that all the FAS members present at the meeting sided with her. If the University wants to maintain its commitment to put people first–engaging with its employees and treating them with respect–the course of action is clear.
After the vote, President Faust told the Crimson she would be “replying in due course.” So far, the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, has said nothing. Our employees and their families deserve better than evasion and silence. Now is the time to make things right. The University should cancel its plans and engage in a dialogue with its non-union workers.
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: November 10, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the cap on personal expenses for a family would be $6,000. In fact, it would be $4,500.

Business leaders, including the former president of Trader Joe’s grocery chain and the general manager of Reddit, shared their experiences in social entrepreneurship with more than 400 participants at this year's Igniting Innovation Summit on Saturday.
The conference, organized and run entirely by Harvard undergraduates, took place in the Northwest Laboratory building. Attendees, who hailed from both the U.S. and abroad, listened to keynote speeches and participated in panel discussions throughout the day.
One panel, titled “The Future of Food,” featured a sophomore from MIT who founded his own company at the age of 15. Kris Bronner, co-creator of UNREAL candy, said inspiration for innovative ideas often comes from everyday situations.
“Where in life are the things that you ask, why is it this way?” Bronner said. “People are always going to have the same ideas as you, no matter where you are in the world.”
But, he added “it’s those crazy people who are like, ‘I’m going to go do it,’” that overcome their initial fears of failure to implement good ideas.
“The people who have failed the most are the ones who succeed in the end,” he said.
The former president of Trader Joe’s, Doug Rauch, also emphasized the importance of failure in producing success in a keynote address later that afternoon.
“If you’re not willing to fail, and if you’re not willing to take a risk, the odds of you stumbling upon the next really innovative thing are really slim,” Rauch said.
Attendees said that they were impressed with the Summit’s level of organization and the quality of its speeches and seminars.
“I had a really great time thinking of new ideas and new innovations that I hope to implement sometime this year,” said Tim Makalinao ’18, adding that the “event was very well organized.”
Providing entrepreneurs with ideas that they will put into practice in the real world was a priority for event organizers, according to Jane Chung '15, co-director of the Summit.
“In the end [the summit] is about inspiring people to be a part of something that’s beyond themselves, really encouraging them and giving them the strength and community to make [their dreams] happen,” she said.

Harvard Arab Weekend brought together entrepreneurs, businesspeople, journalists, and academics to discuss resolutions to pressing issues, including the role of entrepreneurship, across the Arab world during the three-day conference this weekend.
The weekend featured a range of panels and workshops on topics such as energy, education, arts, and entertainment.
Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman of Wamda Ventures, a new venture capital fund focusing on technology investments in the Arab world, was one of the keynote speakers at the conference. He said he deemed entrepreneurship and education two of the most pressing challenges in the Arab world.
“The entrepreneurial culture is something that is required for us to be instilled in our education system,” Ghandour said.
Ghandour said youth would be better equipped in the job market if they have critical thinking skills, instead of merely technical skills, which he said is the norm in the current system.
Fadi Majdalani, a partner at global management consulting firm Strategy&, affirmed the prospects for youth living abroad to return to the Arab region, during his address with Ghandour.
“I think that the impact that each one of you here can actually have back in the region and the impact that you can have on the society over there is much much more than a similar job would allow you to get in the West, because we are starting from a much lower point,” he said.
During a panel discussion entitled “Women in Business,” four female panelists expressed optimism toward women’s influence in the growing startup sector in the region.
Panelist Maali Alasousi, founder and chairwoman of Tamkeen for Development Organization, which aids poor women and youth in Yemen, said small businesses in the Arab market have a promising future.
“I think there are a lot of opportunities for youth and for young business owners and for people who start their own business, especially in the [Middle East],” she said. “Working at the grassroots, this field has not been fulfilled very well.”
IIiana Montauk ’06, director of Gaza Sky Geeks Accelerator, discussed women’s ability to be leaders.
“From my experience in Gaza, women work in teams and they work together cohesively.” Montauk, who described Silicon Valley, Harvard, and Gaza as the three places in the world that had “a really high density of passionate, smart, hard-working, and adaptable people,” said this spirit of teamwork is a great advantage for women in the Arab world.
“When you are going to launch a company, you are going to have to be able to work together as a team. That’s the difference between running a little small business, like a shop, and launching a big company,” Montauk said.

David W. Johnson, longtime senior preceptor and head teaching fellow for Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” which consistently draws one of the highest enrollments at the College, will depart Harvard at the close of the academic year.
Johnson and his wife, Anne Pringle, an associate professor in the Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department, will be moving to Wisconsin at the end of the academic year.
Economics Department Chair N. Gregory Mankiw, who leads Ec 10, said he regrets the loss of Johnson, who he said is “a fantastic teacher and [has been] very influential and charismatic—he has a lot a lot of energy.”
“The whole class appreciates how much he deeply cares about teaching economics,” Mankiw said. “Sadly, this will be the last year that Harvard students will benefit from that.”
Mankiw said the move was prompted by Pringle’s search for a teaching position, after she was not offered tenure at Harvard.
“[Pringle] didn’t get promoted to a tenured position, so she started looking for jobs, and she got a great job at the University of Wisconsin, and David got a job there as well,” Mankiw said.
Johnson wrote in an email that he will serve as a senior lecturer in the Economics Department and Pringle an associate professor of botany at the University of Wisconsin—Madison.
As senior preceptor and head teaching fellow, Johnson is responsible for staffing Economics 10 sections and training all section leaders, as well as preparing the course materials.
“David’s departure is a huge loss,” Economics Director of Undergraduate Study Jeffrey A. Miron wrote in an email. “He has been an incredible asset to Ec10.”
The Economics Department is currently beginning the search for Johnson’s replacement.
“There have been many people that have had the job over the years, and I am sure that we will find someone who is great,” Mankiw said.
Johnson said he will miss students and the diversity of the undergraduate community at Harvard.
“The admissions office gets it right here—they continue to send us extremely talented young people of every country and creed, each with as much to teach us as we can teach them,” Johnson said.

Undergraduate Council representatives passed legislation Sunday evening that expressed concern over a recent study that photographed certain classes without the knowledge of professors or students, and requested that the University release the relevant findings.
Last week, Vice Provost for Advances in Learning Peter K. Bol, in response to a question posed at a meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, admitted that he had authorized a study that used cameras to track attendance for several classes.
At their General meeting Sunday, Council representatives criticized the study, passing legislation to formally request that Bol’s office provide more specifics about the study and when those students who were photographed would be notified. Bol said at the Faculty meeting that the photographs had been destroyed, but wrote in an email afterward that students who were part of the study would be notified “in short order.”
“Who thought this was a good idea, first of all,” UC Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy '16 posed to the Council, which then delved into debate over what legislation would accomplish. Some worried that the  legislation was not clear as to how the information it requests should be released.
Brett M. Biebelberg ’16, the Council’s Rules Committee chair, however, suggested the possibility that the University may have not provided all the relevant or accurate information on the study. Alluding to the 2012 cheating and subsequent email search scandal, in which then Dean of the College Evelynn M. Hammonds doubled back on her original response to the breadth of the searches, Biebelberg suggested more information may need to be released.
Though Biebelberg made clear that he was not accusing any official of lying about the study, he appeared skeptical.
“There have been breaches of trust by the University in the past. I don’t think that trust has fully been rebuilt. I think this incident serves as proof of that, and therefore I think it’s reasonable to raise questions about the totality of information that’s been released,” Biebelberg said after the meeting.
The Council also voted to introduce an amendment to its constitution, which would guarantee that funds allocated to student groups who do not pick up checks by the end of the academic year be spent the following year.
Representatives have until the Council’s next meeting to vote, but a vast majority of those present Sunday voted in favor of the measure.
Council leaders also announced that they had scheduled a meeting with Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, following increased frustration at perceived delays. Council leaders will also meet with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana discuss the possibility 0f a new grant that would be possible if the College would take on the cost of $36,000 the UC currently spends on Drug & Alcohol Peer Advisors and Phillips Brooks House Association. The UC would use the freed-up funds to support events hosted by multiple student groups.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 11, 2014, at 6:45 p.m.
When Brianna J. Suslovic ’16 came to college as a freshman, she joined Queer Students and Allies, which she described as the most “initially accessible umbrella organization” for BGLTQ students at Harvard. But by the end of her sophomore fall, Suslovic had decided to disaffiliate from the group.
Suslovic, who became QSA’s communications and outreach chair in her freshman spring, said that although she enjoyed her time with the organization, one of the primary reasons she withdrew from QSA—an organization founded “to promote community”—was because she did not find it as inclusive as she hoped.
“There were people who didn’t feel comfortable in QSA,” she said. Conversations among group members could be unwelcoming, she added, particularly for newcomers to the queer community who may not know the norms and language prevalent in the group.
Although other queer community members acknowledge concerns regarding inclusion, they point out that in recent years, new official and unofficial spaces have emerged to meet the needs of a diverse population. While the evolution of these groups has provided students with an unprecedented number of ways to engage with the queer community, this growth also raises questions about the role of institutional support and the importance of collaboration across groups.
INTERSECTIONAL INCLUSIVITY
Differences in students’ identity—from interests, backgrounds, gender, and even perception of their sexuality—have led to tensions in umbrella groups like QSA.
“It does divide the community in a certain way, because obviously if you have a really large group, not everybody is going to like each other [or] be on the same page,” said C.Z., a sophomore in Eliot House and a board member of QSA who was granted anonymity by The Crimson because she has not yet come out at home.
According to C.Z., QSA and other queer organizations have been traditionally white and male-dominated, which has prompted concerns about exclusivity.
To rectify this, she and other students have rejuvenated Girlspot, a QSA subcommittee for queer women which had previously been inactive. Now also a Girlspot representative, C.Z. said she believes such small groups address unmet needs in the community.
“The creation of a lot of small intimate spaces that are directed to serve specific minority communities is a very valuable tool,” she said.
W. Powell Eddins ’16, who founded the QSA subcommittee Harvard Undergraduate BGLTQ Business Students earlier this year, cited similar reasons.
Eddins, co-chair of QSA as well as co-president of HUBBS, said that he was frustrated that QSA did not provide support for queer students interested in business. According to Eddins, QSA is “very anti-corporate.”
“There is no recruiting pathway for BGLTQ students [at Harvard], and other schools have one,” he said.
While HUBBS is currently a subgroup of QSA, Eddins said he is hoping to make it an independent organization in the future.
Other organizations designed to cater to sub-groups within the queer community include HBASIS, a group formed last year for queer students interested in the sciences, and BlackOut, another recently revived group for queer and black students.
The issue of inclusivity in Harvard’s queer community also involves political outlook, according to Suslovic, who said the perceived radicalism in the community can alienate newcomers.
Eddins concurs, adding that he thinks “there is a competition within the queer community in being the most progressive...which contributes to a community of ostracization and hostility.”
Yet others like Sasanka N. Jinadasa ’15, a member of Gay Lesbian Or Whatever, a group for queer students of color, think this is, to some extent, unavoidable.
“Everything trans and queer people do is politicized, for better or for worse,” Jinasada said. She added Harvard’s demographics, which tend left of the political spectrum, are reflected in many student groups and might add to this outlook.
DISCONNECTED SPACES
While students say that the creation of new and spin-off groups has increased inclusivity, some said they believe that this has caused fragmentation within the community.
Suslovic said part of the problem is that many of these groups are too small to effectively function. But Joshua D. Blecher-Cohen ’16, a member of the queer Jewish group BAGELS, said that if students with a common identity wish to create a space for themselves, the size of the group should not matter.
“[The groups] don’t need a certain quota to exist,” he said. “You can’t say, ‘Oh no, your queer group, your queer interest isn’t valid—you don’t reach a certain number of people.’”
Another issue is collaboration between different groups. While Director of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life Van Bailey said that student groups are “intentional” in their collaborations, Suslovic argued that queer groups should move beyond co-sponsorships of events and certain “surface-level interactions” to pursue meaningful dialogue about inclusion and accessibility.
Blecher-Cohen acknowledged the need for communication and cooperation between the student groups, and said that the Queer Advisory Council, founded a year ago, helps to address these concerns. The QuAC, as it is called by some students, was established to bring representatives from queer organizations together to discuss community issues.
“[The QuAC] provides a space where student leaders can talk to each other about programming and opportunities for substantive collaboration,” said Blecher-Cohen, a former co-chair of the council. “As the QuAC grows, that will happen more and more.”
Despite some feelings of disjointedness, however, students overwhelmingly believe that smaller queer groups play an important and necessary role in the queer community.
“It’s nice to have that intentional queer person-of-color space,” Christopher Frost ’15 said, referring to BlackOut, of which he is a member. “I don’t think that it takes away or detracts from any other group on campus.”
SUPPORT FROM THE TOP
Concerns regarding inclusion and intersectionality are not new, according to Marco Chan ’11, co-President of the Harvard Gender and Sexuality Caucus, a queer alumni organization, who served as co-Chair of QSA from 2008 to 2011. In 2010, QSA altered its mission statement to include a broader range of identities.
However, compared to his time at Harvard, Chan said that groups formed to fulfill these niche interests and needs now benefit from two trends—the growing experience of queer group leaders on campus and nationwide and increased institutional support from entities such as the Office of BGLTQ Student Life.
According to students and administrators, the office—formed two and a half years ago—helps to address inclusivity issues by providing a safe space for a range of queer community members and bridging the subgroups that have emerged.
Blecher-Cohen, a current intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, said that opportunities to have conversations that are less politicized have increased since the creation of the “Quoffice,” which has an educational purpose. “[The Office of BGLTQ Student Life provides] a space where queer people have an incredibly wide range of opinions,” Blecher-Cohen said.
Some students said they think the office does not play a unique role in the queer community. Bailey, the director of the office, said that the Quoffice will be launching and reforming initiatives this year.
“The past few years have been about conversations and relationship building,” Bailey said. “Now we’re building.”
According to Emelyn dela Pena, assistant dean of student life for equity, diversity, and inclusion, the College can assist inclusion within communities by providing staff training and cultivating a “culture of learning.”
She said that the Office of Student Life has accounted for intersectionality in its approach, citing regular communication and collaboration among the three diversity offices—the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Women’s Center, and the Harvard Foundation—and the recent hiring of diversity fellows tasked with working with all three offices to implement diversity initiatives.
MOVING FORWARD
While many students said they would like the queer community to continue to strive toward inclusivity and solidarity, they acknowledge the complexity of this aspiration.
“I feel like with any community, it’s very hard to say that everyone should coalesce into this one idea of what it means to be something,” Frost said.
Although complications may arise, Blecher-Cohen said it is important to keep in mind that student cooperation and activism can and have already led to positive changes in the queer community. He gave the example of the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, which according to Blecher-Cohen was founded in response to student activism and advocacy for a dedicated institutional space.
Jinadasa, another intern at the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, agreed that the formation of the office marked a step forward for the community.
“I can feel a tangible difference on campus, just from having that institutional support,” she said.
The QSA is also changing its structure to be more welcoming. According to C.Z., these changes include hosting more casual and less politicized discussions focused on sharing experiences, altering the role of the political co-chairs to emphasize their responsibility for inviting speakers, and increasing newcomer participation.
C.Z. said attendance at QSA general meetings has increased this year—with a large number of freshmen attendees—which she believes shows that the organization’s changes have been positively received.
Despite these improvements, Blecher-Cohen said he hopes the community continues to grapple with these issues.
“Inclusivity is never something you reach and it’s done,” he said. “It’s something that—for every new action, every new event, you need to be thinking about it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Crimson entered the weekend 5-0 in five-set matches on the season. Two matches and two days later, the squad pushed that record to 7-0.
Despite late game drama, the Harvard women’s volleyball team’s nine-game winning streak is alive. By besting hosts Princeton and Penn, both by scores of 3-2, the Crimson (17-4, 10-2 Ivy) kept pace with first-place Yale in Ancient Eight competition. With the victories survives the hope of bringing home the team’s first Ivy League title since 2004.
“We keep winning these close matches because we understand what an amazing opportunity we have at hand,” junior Caroline Holte said. “We let the opportunity to win the Ivy title fuel us. Every single person on this team gives 100 percent of themselves physically and emotionally to each point.”
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
If defense wins championships, then Harvard’s final two points against the host Quakers (8-15, 5-7) made a loud statement across the Ivy League. Thanks to a pair of blocks from middle blocker Caroline Walters and outside hitter Jennifer Shults, the Crimson clinched a five-set victory at the Palestra.
But such drama was only necessary because of a Penn surge that erased a 2-0 Harvard lead. At the end of the fourth set, it was the Quaker defense that pushed the match to a fifth game by forcing consecutive attacking errors.
Walters headlined the Crimson attack with 15 kills in addition to two solo blocks and five block assists. Junior Kathleen Wallace, along with sophomores Grace Weghorst and Corie Bain, also contributed more than 10 kills.
“Offensively, our system is always to hit aggressively until they start to dig us,” Holte said. “If they begin to hit us…we can make adjustments and place shots around their defense. We definitely achieved these offensive goals.”
The two teams were neck-and-neck throughout the contest. Harvard and Penn recorded the same number of kills, 66, and the same number of errors, 27. The largest margin of the match was four points, and the Crimson only reached this gap with the last point of play.
“The fifth set is much quicker compared to others, so you really cannot waste any time or any points,” Wallace said. “That sort of quickness and decisiveness of the set is what lights a fire in our team.”
HARVARD 3, PRINCETON 2
In Princeton, N.J., the Crimson survived a late push from the Tigers (13-9, 8-4) thanks to Wallace’s 15 kills and Bain’s ninth triple-double on the season.
The match seesawed back and forth, with Harvard winning the odd sets and Princeton winning the even. But this formula ultimately led to victory as the Crimson took the fifth set with a fitting final kill from Wallace.
“As with any team sport, one player alone cannot accomplish success without others,” Wallace said. “Our setters Corie Bain and Hannah Schmidt worked really hard to give me and the other hitters great sets, and those sets gave me so many options for where to score points.”
After going up, 2-1, Harvard had an opportunity to take the match without advancing to a climatic set. But a combination of two kills from the Tigers and two offensive errors from Bain let Princeton force a fifth game.
“We regroup by talking through what we need to adjust,” Holte said. “Physically, we discuss what offensive players we need to shut down…. Mentally, we remind each other to remain confident and calm and lean on each other.”
The first set was the most closely contested of the match. After the Tigers shot to an early lead, the Crimson clawed back to gain control and ultimately tied the game at 19. For the next eight points, the teams traded scores, but aided by a pair of kills from Wallace, the visitors took the set.
With two games remaining, Harvard is locked in a dead tie with Yale, whom the Crimson has beaten twice. But the Bulldogs have yet to play Princeton, the third-place team in the Ancient Eight.
“The prospect of the title has really given our team the motivation to fight through those tough matches,” Wallace said. “That’s especially true given this past weekend.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last sound of the Harvard field hockey team’s season was thunderous applause.
For the final minute of a 4-1 victory over Columbia, the Crimson fan section shook the stands of Jordan Field with a spontaneous mix of pounding feet and yelling voices. The noise could have been a reaction to the team’s dominant performance over the Lions, or it could have been for Harvard’s four seniors, whom the program recognized with plaques after the Senior Day game.
But the applause that broke out celebrated something larger, namely the end of a season in which Harvard (10-7, 4-3 Ivy) clawed to the top half of the Ivy League and earned its first overall winning record since 2004.
“We spent the last whole year just prepared to make this a winning season,” senior Caitlin Rea said. “Having three years of losing seasons, it’s amazing to finish with such a high.”
Even though the game against Columbia (12-5, 5-2) marked the Crimson’s Senior Day, it was sophomore forward Marissa Balleza who stole the show. Balleza scored a hat trick within 41 minutes to help Harvard jump out to a 4-0 lead.
Aside from the Senior Day festivities, the game had crucial importance for the rest of the Ancient Eight. The Lions entered Cambridge in a tie for first place with Princeton, but after the loss to the Crimson and a win by the Tigers, Columbia ended the season in second.
“We established what kind of intent and attitude we needed to show up with today,” said Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden. “The team had a very clear mission. They didn’t want Columbia to win an Ivy League championship on our home field.”
Throughout the game, the Crimson found success on the counter-attack. Harvard’s first goal began with a long pass from midfielder Elizabeth Warner to back Elizabeth Jacobson. After spinning around her defender, Jacobson found Balleza near the edge of the striking circle, and Belleza’s top right finish beat the goalkeeper.
The imbalanced score line misrepresented parts of the game that featured competitive end-to-end action. At several stages of the match, the Crimson struggled to clear the ball, and this difficulty led to dangerous probing by the Lions. Columbia earned nine penalty corners compared to Harvard’s two, and the visitor’s lone goal came off such an opportunity in the 59th minute.
By the time the Lions got on the board, though, the Crimson held a 4-0 advantage. Balleza scored the team’s fourth goal in the 41st minute with a first-time finish off a cross from teammate Ellie Cookson. It was her third goal of the game and team-leading ninth on the season.
“I’ve been frustrated with my play [recently] and not being able to get shots off,” Balleza said. “Today I thought, all right, it’s the last game of the season, we have to give it our all. I was just trying to rip some shots.”
Balleza’s second goal of the game, which came in the 24th minute, followed a similar model. After collecting a ball that was bouncing around the goalmouth, senior Noel Painter found Balleza for another quick hit.
After the final whistle, the Harvard crowd stuck around to recognize the four seniors on the team. Catriona McDonald, Kaitlyn Boudah, Rea, and Painter had played a combined 257 games and recorded 130 points.
“Playing with my best friends for four years has been an amazing experience,” Rea said. “It’s pretty tough leaving it now, and it feels so soon. [It’s] definitely an emotional day.”
The win over the Lions capped off an impressive final four games that included tight matches against conference-leading Princeton and nationally ranked Boston College. By beating Dartmouth and Columbia over the past two weekends, the Crimson ensured a winning record in the Ivy League for the first time since 2007.
“There’s no reason why Harvard field hockey should not be successful,” van Herwaarden said. “We have fantastic athletes and a fantastic school behind us…. With the right work and the right attitude, we can accomplish a lot. This season is the first of many great seasons to come.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Uncertainty filled Soldiers Field as the clock wound down on the Harvard men’s soccer team’s contest against Columbia Saturday night.
Following a Dartmouth victory earlier in the afternoon, the Crimson faced a simple scenario. In order to keep its hopes of an Ivy League championship alive, Harvard needed to win. Yet with just seven minutes remaining, the game remained scoreless.
The lack of activity on the scoreboard was hardly a surprise, however, as the Crimson had failed to register a single shot on goal. But in the 84th minute, junior forward Tim Schmoll proved that one shot would be all that the team would need, lifting Harvard to a 1-0 victory over the Lions.
“We knew at halftime, and even going into the game, that this was going to be a game where we just needed to fight,” junior forward Tim Schmoll said. “We just needed to grind it out.”
In its last two contests, the Crimson has produced two goals on just two shots on target, squeaking out a tie against the Big Green last weekend and now a victory. But to earn the latter, Harvard (10-4-2, 3-1-2 Ivy) needed a little bit of luck.
With 6:40 remaining in regulation, junior defender Michael Klain delivered a towering throw-in into the box, but the threat diminished when junior co-captain Mark Ashby barely got his head on it.
The ball skipped to the right of the goal, and Columbia (7-7-2, 2-3-1) looked poised to make a clearance. But showing a lack of judgment, Lions’ defender Bryce Terrill reached up with his left hand and swatted the ball down to the ground, giving the Crimson a penalty kick.
Without hesitation, Schmoll stepped up to the dot, and the 6’6” forward delivered. With Columbia goaltender Kyle Jackson diving to the right, Schmoll powered a shot into the bottom left corner of the net, then kicked over the corner flag in celebration.
“Tim was fantastic on his [penalty kick]—very composed,” Harvard coach Pieter Lehrer said. “He’s always like that in training, and he’s like that as a person—very calm and collected.”
Behind the leadership of its seniors, the Crimson closed the book on a perfect 9-0 season at home with the win. The last time Harvard achieved such a feat was in 2008—a year when the Crimson reached the second round of the NCAA Tournament.
“It’s a fantastic class, and they lead the entire group,” Lehrer said. “Anything that the players need advice on, the seniors are the first to give it. They’ve had a massive impact on the quality of this team.”
While the Crimson managed just one shot on goal for the game, the Lions tallied seven. But junior goalkeeper Evan Mendez was there to stop every one of them—with none bigger coming just seconds before Harvard’s goal.
After junior defender Andrew Chang surrendered possession of the ball deep in his own territory, Columbia defender Rhys Williams had room to run. The sophomore darted toward the 18-yard line, initiated a give-and-go, and then launched a rocket at Mendez.
But Mendez, en route to his third shutout during Ivy play, used both hands to swat the chance away. The ball then bounced out to senior captain Kyle Henderson, who initiated the counter-attack that led to the goal.
“Like any good goalie, you don’t want to notice [Mendez] until it’s a big moment to make a save, and that’s what he did,” Lehrer said. “It might have been his best game.”
The Crimson would need each and every one of those seven saves to preserve the result. This has been the case all year long, as all six of Harvard’s conference contests this season have been separated by just a goal.
Heading into the season’s final weekend, the Crimson trails conference leaders Princeton and Dartmouth by two points. But according to Lehrer, Harvard has already been approaching every game as a “must-win.”
“It was a very typical Ivy League game when a lot’s on the line,” Lehrer said. “[It was] very physical and very emotional—much like a playoff game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It may not have come out on top at the end of the day, but the Harvard men’s water polo team had a lot to be pleased with this weekend.
Despite losing to Brown in the championship game of the CWPA Northern Championships, the Crimson (21-8, 7-4 CWPA) put up a strong fight, defeating longtime rival St. Francis and cross-town foe MIT Saturday afternoon. Harvard entered the championship tournament as the No. 6-seed amongst the seven teams in the CWPA Northern Division.
“Obviously we would have liked to have won the championship game today,” junior goalie Colin Woolway said. “But I think overall we are happy with where we are at and are pretty confident going into Easterns in a few weeks.”
BROWN 9, HARVARD 6
An early scoring frenzy put Harvard in the hole early, falling behind 6-1 in the first half. Despite a strong second half, it wasn’t enough to forge a full comeback and defeat No. 11 Brown (24-6,11-1).
Following four straight goals by the Bears, Lee was finally able to put one away for the Crimson, but it would be the only goal Harvard scored in the first two frames.
But the team was able to turn things around in the second half, outscoring Brown, 5-3, in the final two quarters. Lee sparked the Crimson’s scoring with a goal early in the third, and sophomore Joey Colton and senior co-captain Max Murphy added to the Harvard’s total to cut the lead to three.
Because of its strong performance at the Northern Championships, the Crimson will compete as the No. 3 seed at the CWPA Eastern Championships in two weeks.
“Our main goal this year, and for the past three years I’ve been on the team has been to win this championship,” co-captain Max Murphy said. “The winner of the Eastern Championship goes on to the NCAA Championships in California, so that’s something that we’ve definitely been striving for and setting our eyes on this year.”
HARVARD 11, ST. FRANCIS 10
All season long, the Crimson has battled with St. Francis (14-11,10-2), but up until this weekend Harvard had been unsuccessful at upending the Terriers. However, in its second consecutive overtime contest, the Crimson was finally able to finish off St. Francis by a slim one-goal margin in order to move on to the championship game.
The game started off similar to many for Harvard this season, with the Crimson trailing in the first half, 5-2. It was able, however, to inch back in the second half. After tying the score at five early in the third quarter, the game went back and forth as Harvard and the Terriers traded goals in the fourth until the Crimson sent the game into overtime with a goal with 2:55 left in the fourth quarter.
Harvard took a quick lead in the overtime period, giving it an 11-9 lead that St. Francis could not overcome.
“We felt like we should have won the last game too that we lost in overtime at their place,” goalie Colin Woolway said. “Stuff like that just comes down to the wire and one moment can decide the outcome of the game. We put ourselves in a position to win the game and that was enough.”
HARVARD 14, MIT 8
In its quarterfinal game of the tournament, Harvard took the lead early and held on throughout the contest to beat the Engineers (14-15, 4-8). Offense has been a strength for the Crimson all season, with a record of 18-4 in games when the team scored 10 or more goals, and that held true again on Saturday.
Junior Blake Lee continued his goal scoring attack, leading the team with five goals. Lee has consistently been a strong offensive force for the team all season.
Woolway held resilient against a tough MIT offense led by junior Ory Tasman, keeping the Engineers scoreless in the final quarter to secure the victory.
This week’s win was the third time Harvard has defeated MIT this season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A freshman, senior, and a pair of sophomores brought home hardware this weekend as the Harvard women’s tennis team ended its fall season with a bang. The Crimson won both singles categories and took home the doubles win at this weekend’s Harvard Invitational. The Invitational, held Friday and Saturday at Harvard’s Murr Center, pitted the Crimson against Boston University, Cornell, Pittsburgh, and Syracuse.
“We all practiced hard after regionals [in October],” Harvard sophomore June Lee said. “Everyone had some tough matches before getting to the finals, so everyone fought hard and we just wanted to represent Harvard in the best way possible.”
The A Flight singles competition featured four Crimson players. Each Harvard competitor won her first match on Friday. Lee ousted Cornell freshman Priyanka Shah in straight sets, 6-2, 6-1, while Ellen Jang-Milsten defeated her BU challenger, 4-6, 7-5, 10-4 in a freshman showdown.
Crimson rookie Annika Ringblom gained the edge against Syracuse, 4-6, 7-6, 10-8. And sophomore Monica Lin capped off the Crimson first-round sweep by besting her Pitt opponent, 6-2, 6-3.
In the quarterfinals, Jang-Milsten and Lin advanced after beating Cornell adversaries in straight sets, but Lee and Ringblom fell short. In Saturday’s final, Jang-Milsten prevailed in a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 match against Big Red’s Lizzie Stewart. The No. 54 recruit captured her second title of the fall season after having won the singles championship at the Cissie Leary Invitational in September.
“Ellen has been a remarkable freshman for us this semester,” said Harvard head coach Traci Green. “She’s really showed a lot of poise on the court. Ellen works really hard and it’s great to see all of her hard work pay off. All of her matches were very tough this tournament. It was great to see her battle through all of her circumstances and find a way.”
In the flight B singles, Harvard sent four more athletes to the quarterfinals. Senior captain Sylvia Li, junior Amanda Lin, and sophomore Danielle Mirda each played to straight set victories while junior Amy He ultimately fought out a hard-earned win after dropping the first set.
In the semifinals, Li bested Pittsburgh senior Molly Wickman while Mirda was victorious against a Cornell rookie. Both Crimson victories came in straight sets while teammates Lin and He both fell in the same fashion.
The Crimson was again unable to set up an all-Harvard final, with Li achieving a win while Mirda fell to Wickman’s twin sister, Amanda. In the matchup of seniors on Saturday morning, Li was victorious in a tough fought match. She eventually won against her opposition from Pittsburgh in straight sets, 7-6, 6-4. The Cupertino, Calif. native won her first singles crown since the Harvard Fall Classic her freshman year.
“It’s been a pleasure to see Sylvia develop over the years,” Green said. “She’s come a long way. Even though she didn’t play her best, she found a way to pull through and that’s the kind of leadership we need going into the spring season.”
Four Harvard players competed in the quarterfinals of doubles play. The flight A and flight B singles champions teamed up, while the couplings of Ringblom and Mirda, Amanda Lin and He, and Monica Lin and Lee also advanced. The pairings of Ringblom and Mirda, as well as teammates Lee and Lin both advanced to the semifinals while the other two Harvard teams failed to make it to Saturday’s play.
The third set of semifinals was the charm for the Crimson, as both teams were victorious. Ringblom and Mirda defeated a team from Syracuse, while Lee and Lin dominated over Pitt. In the final, it was the sophomores Lee and Lin who brought home the title, winning by a score of 8-2.
“This is the first time we’ve played together in a tournament,” Lee said. “We practiced the last two weeks together and everything was going pretty smoothly. We wanted to work on being aggressive and communicating well. We really clicked as a team.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team concluded its fall season this past weekend, with team members competing at both the ITA National Indoor Championships in New York and the Tribe Invitational, hosted by William & Mary.
While co-captain Denis Nguyen and sophomore Brian Yeung fell short for the Crimson on a national stage at the ITA Championships, the rest of the squad performed well at the Tribe Invitational and captured several All-Tournament awards.
ITA NATIONAL INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS
While most of the team traveled to William & Mary, Nguyen—who became Harvard’s first All-American since 2005 with his run to the semifinals of last season’s NCAA singles tournament—and Yeung headed to Flushing Meadows, N.Y. for the ITA National Indoor Championships to compete in doubles.
In addition to Nguyen and Yeung, two doubles pairs from defending Ivy champion Columbia also represented the conference in Flushing Meadows.
Nguyen and Yeung, who started playing together this fall, qualified for the tournament after earning doubles champion honors in the ITA Northeast Regional Championships in October. The duo was one of just 20 doubles pairs competing at the event.
On Thursday, Nguyen and Yeung went up against Alex Lawson and Billy Pecor of Notre Dame, but fell short in a close three-set match, 6-4, 4-6, 1-0(3).
Despite the first-round loss, the pair found success in the consolation round, taking down Deni Zmak and Jaime Sanchez from Embry-Riddle, 6-3, 6-4, and followed that up with a 6-3, 3-6, 1-0(7) win over Ian Dempster and Robbie Mudge from NC State.
Nguyen, who partnered for the past three seasons with Casey MacMaster ’14 to form a formidable doubles team that ranked as high as sixth in the nation last year, said that playing with Yeung remains a work in progress.
“The partnership is going great so far,” Nguyen said. “It’s been refreshing to play with a new face and new personality, and getting used to a new person’s name. But we just need a little more match experience together so that I can better understand his tendencies and what he’s like under pressure.”
TRIBE INVITATIONAL
The rest of the Crimson went to William & Mary to compete in the annual fall season-closing Tribe Invitational, and the team turned in a strong performance to wrap up the first segment of its year-long campaign.
The tournament featured players from the Tribe, Penn State, and Old Dominion, and it featured a mock-dual format over two days designed to maximize the number of matches played.
On Friday, Harvard took on the Nittany Lions in both singles and doubles. In singles, the Crimson took six of eight matches, highlighted by sophomore Sebastian Beltrame’s 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 win over No. 29 Leo Stakhovsky.
Freshmen Grant Solomon and Jean Thirouin also picked up victories; Thirouin’s came in dramatic 4-6, 6-4, 10-7 fashion over Christian Lutschaunig.
In doubles, Harvard won all three matches over Penn State. The top tandem of junior Nicky Hu and Beltrame won, 8-4, co-captain Alex Steinroeder and freshman Kenny Tao followed suit, 8-5, and junior Conor Haughey and Solomon cruised, 8-2.
“Last year when we played Penn State at this same tournament, we lost most matches to them,” Steinroeder said. “So we’re very happy, and it’s good to see such improvement from last year.”
The Crimson also played doubles against the Monarchs, picking up one of three contests. Beltrame and Solomon took their match, but the other two Harvard duos fell short against their Old Dominion counterparts.
On Saturday, Harvard took seven of its eight singles matches against the Monarchs, with the only loss being Beltrame’s defeat at the hands of No. 42 Carlos Lopez Villa. Six of the Crimson’s seven wins came in two sets.
In doubles, Harvard also turned in a strong showing, winning two of three over the Tribe. Hu and Beltrame fell in the top spot, but Steinroeder and Tao, along with Haughey and sophomore Andrew Ball, successfully captured their matches.
On Sunday, the Crimson prevailed in four of six singles matches against William & Mary. Beltrame took first singles, Tao and Ball cruised in two sets, and senior Shaun Chaudhuri came back to win a three-setter over Will Juggins.
Steinroeder also won, 6-4, 6-3, against the Nittany Lions’ Roman Trkulja, and Solomon fell in two sets.
Beltrame and Steinroeder, who went undefeated in singles on the weekend, both earned All-Tournament honors, while the team of Steinroeder and Tao took home All-Tournament doubles accolades.
The weekend presented a solid final opportunity for the Crimson to get quality matches in and solidify potential doubles pairings.
“I think the guys learned a lot this weekend, and we got some good matches in,” Steinroeder said. “We also made good progress in determining doubles pairings. I think four of six spots are set, but third doubles is up in the air.”
Harvard will now break for the winter until Jan. 17. Its spring season will start the same way its fall ended, as the squad’s first match comes against William & Mary.
“I think we progressed well this fall,” Steinroeder said. “Everyone has stayed healthy, and it’s been really good to see the freshmen develop…. If everyone [trains hard] over winter break, then we should be a pretty good team come spring.”

Last spring we were all entertained by “IVY,” a web series directed by an angsty Harvard kid about the angst of Harvard kids. Unfortunately, “IVY” has been taking its sweet time with its long-awaited second episode, and in its stead has emerged a new web series “Absent,” from the makers of Ivory Tower. As of now, there is only a teaser trailer for “Absent.” Nevertheless, as we eagerly await the series’ first episode, we’ve taken this golden opportunity to compare the two web series against intricate and foolproof criteria.
Number of attractive people
IVY: Ollie’s nose ring is adorable. DK is adorkable. Layla is flawless, both physically and in the way she casually turns down her pot dealer when he tries to ask her out. Harley is beautiful but doesn’t seem to realize this—yet. And Luc manages to rock a tiara and still look breathtaking.
Absent: Has Skip Ros ‘17, so everyone else is irrelevant.
WINNER: ABSENT
Number of contemplative looks in the distance
IVY: Around four.
Absent: Innumerable.
WINNER: ABSENT
Best background music
IVY: Upbeat jazzy synth-pop chords and M.I.A. singing “Come Walk With Me.”
Absent: Light piano broodingly playing in the background that is drowned out by the angsty conversation and basically disappears.
WINNER: IVY
View of Charles in the background
IVY: Looks pretty good.
Absent: Still looks pretty good.
WINNER: TIE
Most awkwardly delivered lines
IVY: Beefy rower dude, to Harley, as she tries to sneak out quietly after a one-night stand: “Bye, Amy.”
Absent: Random guy, with no context whatsoever: “You said there were… others?”
WINNER: IVY
Best one-liners
IVY: Ollie runs into his ex-boyfriend and they have an awkward conversation in the snow. Ollie’s ex-boyfriend: “The last time we ‘hung out’ you flaked on me and I walked in on you cheating on me!” Ollie’s response: “I know, I was there.”
Absent: Random girl, with no context whatsoever: “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?”
WINNER: IVY
Best awkward pauses
IVY: “Which topic are you writing your paper on?” the TF asks Ollie. After a long awkward pause, Ollie stutters, “Um, well, I really like this one about mimesis.” The TF digests this for a moment, then says, “Well they’re all about mimesis in some way, so…”
Absent: Dude turns around, seems surprised at something we cannot see, and says: “Oh. Uh. Hey.”
WINNER: IVY
Most realistic scene
IVY: The time when DK is “working” with Layla in Lamont. Layla looks over at DK’s screen briefly and, exasperated, says, “Get off BuzzFeed and start working.” DK asks incredulously, “Then how will I ever know why 2013 was the best ever year for redheads?” Was “IVY” eavesdropping on my conversations with my friends in Lamont? At least I know why 2013 was the best year for redheads, which is more than DK will ever know.
Absent: Really, none of them.
WINNER: IVY
Level of angst
IVY: People smile, bake muffins (unsuccessfully), occasionally get locked out of their own dorms, have awkward conversations with their TFs and their ex-boyfriends and their bed companions of last night’s one-night stand. Typical college stuff, really.
Absent: No one smiles. We see individual people speaking to others - but we can’t see who they’re speaking to. A brunette girl says exasperatedly to her friend sitting behind her, “You don’t have to do this by yourself, Michelle,” as she plays with a flip phone (maybe that’s why she’s so angsty?). “What the fuck is going on?” a man asks angrily as he looks up from the book he was reading - presumably something rife with angst. “WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING HERE?” demands a very angry looking girl. Skip Ros ‘17 looks intently into someone’s eyes and imparts deep wisdom: “It could affect all of us, or it could affect...you.” And at the very end, a mysterious blonde girl is seen throwing herself on a bed, tearing at her hair and screaming in pain/frustration/angst. So. Much. Angst.
WINNER: Absent

College life doesn’t leave a lot of time for leisure reading. Between midterms and papers, extracurricular activities and socializing, it’s hard to find time to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. However, the calm of the post-midterm lull might be a good time to take advantage of the University’s extensive library system as well as the beautiful, well-stocked Cambridge Public Library. It is rare to live in such close proximity to publishing writers, so we’ve put together a short list of recently published novels and nonfiction by Harvard College faculty.
Jamaica Kincaid, See Now Then
Many of you might be shocked to hear that the celebrated novelist Jamaica Kincaid is teaching a class here this year, African American Literature from the Beginnings to the Harlem Renaissance. You might be familiar with her more famous works, namely Annie John and Lucy. Be sure to check out her latest novel, See Now Then, and maybe have a chat with her during office hours.
James Wood, The Fun Stuff and Other Essays
You may know the brilliant literary critic by How Fiction Works, his glittering book reviews in the New York Times, and his popular class, Postwar American and British Fiction. You may not, however, be familiar with his latest work, The Fun Stuff—a collection of essays on contemporary literature. Wood might be a good place to start with leisure reading. His nuanced, highly informed passion for contemporary literature is infectious, and will surely reignite old readerly passions.
Stephen Burt, Belmont
Lauded poet and critic, Stephen Burt is teaching Literature and Sexuality, and a Poets class at the College in the Spring semester. His latest collection of poems, Belmont, was very well received by critics and readers alike. Just one piquant glimpse of his poetic mastery:
“If you mock us, Pan,In whom we also believe, do itAs gently as you can.”
The People on the Bus
Afsaneh Najmabadi, Professing Selves: Transsexuality and Same-Sex Desire in Contemporary Iran
Najmabadi is a WGS and History Professor at the college. Since the mid-1980s, the Islamic Republic of Iran has permitted and even partially subsidized sex reassignment surgery. Najmabadi explores this surprising toleration of transgender people in her historical and ethnographic research. Very interesting given the recent visibility and discussion of trans rights in the media.

You probably thought you were fine skipping the majority of your 200-person lectures last semester (hey, you got an A- anyway), but it turns out that someone was watching. People are crying Big Brother because, in a move reminiscent of a certain former dean's lack of respect for privacy, the University approved a study monitoring lecture attendance that involved photographing students without their knowledge. The results of the study have not been released, but we can guess what they probably caught you doing when you did show up:
1. Sleeping. We know you’ve been there.
2. Facebook stalking that special someone from your entryway. Also, praying that none of that someone’s friends are sitting behind you.
3. Zoning out. While staring blankly in the direction of the professor doesn’t actually help you learn, it does at least make you look like you’re paying attention, so maybe the professors behind the secret camera couldn’t tell.
4. Various embarrassing and unsubtle actions: Nose picking, crotch scratching, outfit adjusting… yeah, we saw you. And we’re judging you.
5. Reading Flyby. Because there’s no better time than lecture to catch up on what really matters at Harvard that day.

Good morning, Harvard! It’s Monday, which means you can probably count the number of things you currently like about life on one hand. Here are some things that will hopefully make you feel a little bit better about your day:
1) Harvard-Yale weekend is 11 days away! We get to finally show off all our Crimson apparel without feeling judged by the outside world, pretend we care about sports, drink and party on repeat, and remember the fact that we have two more days of school after H-Y weekend while Yale doesn’t!
2) This NYTimes Thanksgiving cooking guide that will make you drool. Who doesn’t enjoy looking at high-def photos of that one meal of the year where no one will judge you for eating 10 helpings of mashed potatoes and 4 slices of pumpkin pie?
3) A baby hare looks like this and is called a leveret.
4) This picture that Humans of New York took in Washington Square Park (sorry in advance for the next 10 million hours you’ll waste flipping through these pictures).
IN THE ATMOSPHEREIt’s going to be a nice day today! It’ll be a high of 59 degrees and there’s a zero percent chance of rain, and that’s awesome because we’ll take anything we can get to make Mondays a little less miserable.
