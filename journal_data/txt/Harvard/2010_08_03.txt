CAMBRIDGE, Mass.—I wonder if Martha C. Engler felt lonely when she died last month, at age 100 in West Roxbury. To a young snoop like this reporter, her life seems profoundly disconnected and a Google search yields no trace save her obituary in The Dorchester Reporter. Like the Reporter’s other obituaries, Ms. Engler’s reads like a resumé:
“Beloved daughter of the late Rudolph & Eva (Harfmann) Engler. Survived by many dear friends. Retired children’s librarian. Past prefect of the Immaculate Conception Sodality. Past President of the Mattapannock Women’s Club of South Boston.”
Although these fragments of sentences and lives are eerily evocative in their own right, it was a different type of morbid curiosity that initially led me to the Reporter’s obituary page. Community newspaper obituaries are the pinnacle of doom in modern society—the most doomed section of the most doomed newspapers in an industry that seems summarily doomed. While the obituaries in The New York Times or The Boston Globe have quirky characters, skillful prose, and huge (if languishing) corporations on their side, it’s entirely likely that the Martha C. Englers of 2015 will go un-commemorated.
It’s not only their loss. It’s easy to look askance on neighborhood newspapers, which are often distributed for free and rely heavily on coupons, Little League victories and the fluctuations of the local restaurant industry for their content. Boston is home to more than 30 of them, and they reflect the city’s atomized history. Although Boston’s neighborhoods have always had their own identities, as the city’s population grew in the 1970s and 1980s, many of them started their own newspapers to cover local topics and provide micro-targeted advertising for small businesses. The city also has a slew of ethnic newspapers, which reflect the concerns and prejudices of old Boston, and show that certain cultural identities remain salient. The obituaries in these prove just as quirky, if not as brutally clinical, as the ones in the Dorchester Reporter.
Some features of Boston’s community newspapers will survive the industry’s painful shift to digital media. Coupons, local news coverage, and targeted advertising are even more effective on the Internet than they are in print. Death notices, though, pose a different problem. Small newspaper obituaries require a captive audience—people generally do not scour the Internet for such announcements to read in their free time. The form is already fading into obsolescence; we chronicle our lives in such detail on Facebook, Twitter and our blogs that a summary upon our death seems redundant. Indeed, Facebook now offers the option of “memorializing” the pages of dead users, freezing the status updates and wall posts for posterity.
It’s a shame. These pieces provide some of the rawest insights that the media has to offer into a rapidly vanishing city. As individuals are priced out of the neighborhoods where they grew up, the sharp contours of Boston’s wildly diverse, culturally distinct neighborhoods are being replaced by the flat surface of a bland, gentrified metropolis. There’s also a populist appeal to these obituaries that should not be overlooked—if former spies and concert trombonists deserve eulogies in The Times, why not a children’s librarian? Her Spartan characterization only adds to her appeal. For all we know, the real Martha C. Engler might have been crotchety, selfish, or cold. But as far as The Dorchester Reporter is concerned, her life can be aptly summarized in five subject clauses. Reductive? Probably. But it also leaves room for us to find a bit of ourselves in Ms. Engler—and that unintended poignancy is certainly something worth eulogizing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK, NY – While I set up the shot for the final assignment of my internship I glance again at the sunset. As the sun dips below the New Jersey buildings across the Hudson and the sky dissolves from a dazzling orange into a dark starlit tapestry, I suddenly realize that I’ve hit the twilight of my summer vacation. It’s almost August. My internship is basically over. In a week I will be heading to Europe for one final summer adventure before school starts up again in the fall. After I complete this assignment, for the first time in a while, I will have absolutely nothing to do.
Which is why after we wrap I bid farewell to my former co-workers and, being single myself, decide to wander around the white party for Jewish singles in Riverside Park that I have been filming. After taking in the scene and mingling for a few minutes, however, I come to realize that in the midst of these hip denizens of Manhattan, I’m the perhaps the only person here who is still in college.
And this scares me. It is a glimpse of what my summer nights will one day begin to look like.
To be sure, people in their late twenties to early thirties are far from elderly, but in my myopic, adolescent outlook on life these young professionals can no longer be considered young. They have already entered the real world. They are at least somewhat self-sufficient. Most of them have officially chosen their career paths, and the ones that did not pick academia have thus totally eschewed the concept of a summer vacation.
As a twenty-one year old still incubating in university, I soon find myself as the center of attention of the older women at this party. But this is a curse far more than a blessing. An encounter with a cute girl six years my senior that begins with an epic Twizzler swordfight quickly devolves into a career counseling session after I divulge my interest in attending law school. (“Divorce law is depressing,” she says, referring to her own profession. “Don’t do divorce law.”) A gaudy middle-aged woman in an ill-fitting white blouse asks for my sign and gets far too giggly when I reveal that I’m an Aquarius. (“I’m an Aries!” She shrieks. “You’re water and I’m fire. We go together perfectly!”)
After numerous painful and hilariously awkward moments like these, I come to discover how truly lucky I am that I do not have work in the morning. The mixer is slated to end at 3 A.M. but most of the guests will be out of here long before then. Yet I could stay here for hours, flirting with the graduate students and the unemployed women as they discuss their ex-husbands until dawn. I need to relish everything I feel at these moments of aimlessness, I realize, because, quite simply, moments like these are ephemeral.
I find an iron railing to lean on at the edge of the party. From there I watch as a few intrepid singles make their way down to the playground with their new romantic partners. They take off their shoes and swing like children from the monkey bars in their white shirts and dresses. I stand above them and smile as I look to the buildings lit up like fireflies across the river and savor the taste of the evening air.

BOTHA’S HILL, South Africa—“So wait…you mean you’re not a medical student?”
Though I’m inwardly groaning, I smile and nod at this tall, overdressed woman. She appears to be the substitute dietician, and she appears to know everything about me—from my name to the fact that my co-intern departed last week. I’ve never laid eyes on her before in my life.
“Right. I’m pre-med. I’m still in college.”
It’s about 10 A.M. on a Thursday. I’ve been at work at the HIV clinic for 90 minutes, and it’s already been a long day. I can predict exactly how this conversation will go: for the umpteenth time since my arrival in South Africa, I will have to explain that no, although I’m 21 years old, I’m not yet in medical school. We Americans do things differently.
The novelty of this conversation has long worn off, and I would much rather be playing peek-a-boo with the two-year-old boy sitting in the waiting room in front of me. He doesn’t understand a word of English, but things are simpler that way sometimes. Peek-a-boo transcends the English/Zulu language barrier, and for this reason, Thursdays—the day when the pediatrician is on duty in the clinic—are my favorite days at Ethembeni.
Then the dietician drops the second-most common question I am asked in South Africa: “So, what’s different about our country compared to yours?”
This is a question that I find unnecessarily difficult to answer.
The education system, obviously, is a difference I spend a lot of time talking about. The fences that line middle- and upper-class neighborhoods also come to mind. I have never seen such a concentration of electric fences in such a widespread area as I have in my travels around the greater Durban area. There’s greater poverty here, of course, and we don’t have HIV clinics like this at home because there’s no need for them. Throw in the obvious stuff—different language, different majority race, different indigenous animals—and I can generate a pretty good, if uninspired, list.
But after that, I start to get stuck.
Well then, surely the food or the TV shows or the rhythm of life? Every evening here, I walk home from the hospital, check my email, read a little bit, eat dinner (last night: spaghetti bolognese), and watch television with the family I live with (their favorite shows: Survivor, Gossip Girl, and Will & Grace). Sounds pretty much like what I would be doing at home, except here, I get to watch a beautiful sunset over the Valley of 1,000 Hills every night, and though it’s the middle of winter, we still go to the beach on the weekends. So there’s that, at least.
Eventually, the dietician grows bored of our conversation. Maybe it’s just that I’m grumpy—close to 100 patients come through the clinic each day, and registering them and sorting through their files is a monotonous task in this computer-less system—and not willing to engage in intellectual debate this morning.
I turn back to the little boy. He’s been tugging at his mother’s skirt, but upon realizing that my attention is back on him, he toddles over to my desk, and we resume our game of peek-a-boo.
Or maybe it’s just that things really aren’t so different after all.

BEIJING, China—Beijing is perhaps the most intimidating example of the modern city that I have ever seen. Highways ranging from 10 to 14 lanes run straight through the center of the city, and major roads can only be crossed through underground passages. The exhaust of factories and cars creates an impenetrable smog and there are tall, concrete apartment buildings and shiny new office complexes as far as the eye can see.
Yet, sometimes, you’ll manage to stumble upon an entirely different world. If you get lost or off the main track, you might happen upon narrow, winding streets with small, traditional houses and a hive of activity. People are outside playing cards and talking to the neighbors while sidewalk vendors hawk basic goods and tasty foods. The smells, sounds, and sights of these hutongs, traditional alleyways and narrow streets of Beijing, paint a sharp contrast to the silent and heartless concrete jungle that makes up a large portion of the city.
Now this is not to say that much of the development is welcome; a modern city with amenities and accommodations fit for the 21st century is something that everyone deserves to live in, and economic development inevitably will bring about urban transformation. But sometimes, in the interest of preserving a special part of China’s heritage, the government should set aside areas as protected for historical purposes and make sure that they stay as they were.
A connection to a country’s history and origins is essential for forming a national identity and informing views on the past and future. In the old neighborhoods of hutongs, everyone hangs out with their neighbors and a strong sense of community develops. People internalize the neighborhood and it becomes a part of their experience and their life. As the entire nation moves to apartment buildings, its important to preserve some of the old city to still have that understanding of what a traditional Chinese community used to be, and what, exactly, progress has meant for the society.
A recent New York Times article documents how the historic Gulou neighborhood, north of Tiannamen Square, will soon be demolished to make way for the “polished tourist destination” of “Beijing Time Cultural City.” Residents are mixed on the changes, but some intellectuals and historians are fighting to save the space. As Yao Yuan, a Peking University professor, puts it, “this is not about preserving a historic monument. It’s about saving a living, breathing community that has evolved organically over hundreds of years.”
The Gulou area is one of the last neighborhoods of its kind in Beijing; its loss would be another blow to the heart of the city. Granted, this will mean a few less apartment buildings and maybe the loss of a tourist complex and new department store. Yet with its staggering growth, China will have no lack of any of these amenities even if it does set aside some areas for preservation. The small sacrifice now will have immense returns when this generation’s grandchildren are still able to see a little bit of old Beijing.

MUMBAI, India—Riding the train in Mumbai is what expats call “an experience.” The cobweb of local lines is how most locals navigate this congested city, and trains, in fact, are iconic in Indian films.
The Indian train system is epic. It is considered the backbone of the economy and transports about 6.9 million passengers a day across Mumbai. The stations—a chaotic tangle  of train tracks, stairs, and overpasses—are also emblematic of the railway system’s political disarray.
The general guidelines for train-riding recommended to all visiting Americans generally include: 1. Make sure it’s Sunday midday when it is most quiet. 2. Go with someone who knows the train system. 3. Buy a first class ticket. 4. Sit in the ladies car. 5. Only do it once.
I did not heed the instructions exactly. Nevertheless, riding my first local train (on a Wednesday evening during rush hour, without a fellow female escort, in second-class), I discovered affection and pandemonium in the ladies car.
Rush hour in the ladies car is a little like a girls’ bathroom during a high school dance. Sweaty women pack together, pushing and shoving for space, gossiping, adjusting their hair and outfits, admiring jewelry that sellers bring around on something that resembles a clothes hanger. A few women remove their hijabs to wipe sweat from their necks. Loud giggling girls are jostled aside by aggressive women holding children. Whenever I travel alone by train, I am the only foreigner in the car. But squished together with students in school uniforms and women in saris, I am just another one of the girls.
About three stops away from my destination, I ask the women around me which side I must exit from, and then start pushing toward the door. If I wait until my stop to attempt to get to the exit, I’ll never make it–I’ll be trampled by a flood of women pressing to board the train. But in the ladies car I am always in good hands; when I ask for my stop, a few women will take it upon themselves to fuss over me, to thrust me in the right direction, and to prod me off the still-moving train as it pulls into the station, to be absolutely sure I get off just in time.
The unexpected sense of camaraderie that I have discovered in a foreign (and formerly intimidating) daily activity is both perplexing and wonderful. To all the women who have helped me find the right track, who have shoved me towards the door, who have jumped off the moving train while clutching my arm, and who have made me feel at home on the Bombay Western railway, I thank you.
