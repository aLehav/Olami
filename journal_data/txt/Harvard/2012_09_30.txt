After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Philip V. Streich ’13, a Leverett House undergraduate, died on Tuesday in an accident at his family’s farm in Platteville, Wis., Leverett administrators announced in an email to students on Sunday.
Streich was widely known at the College as a scientific prodigy who had co-founded two companies. He started nanotechnology firm Graphene Solutions as a teenager, before coming to Harvard, and was the founder and CEO of clean energy company Streich Solar Industries.
At the time of his death, he was on leave from the College, pursuing his scientific businesses.
Streich was also known for the awards he won in science competitions including the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair prior enrolling at the College.
“His energy, intelligence, and talent were apparent to all who knew him,” Leverett House Master Howard M. Georgi ’68 and Resident Dean Lauren E. Brandt ’01 wrote in their email.
The email said that a gathering in Leverett House Junior Common Room will be held Sunday evening in memory of Streich and his family will host a memorial service in Princeton, N.J.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An Evening with Champions, a Eliot House-based charity event that raises money for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute’s  Jimmy fund, celebrated its 42nd anniversary with star-studded list of competitive skaters this weekend.
Over the past four decades, the student-organized event has raised over $2.5 million for the cancer institute. Though this year’s total has not yet been calculated, last year the show collected a record $86,000 for the Jimmy Fund.
Paul S. Wylie ’90-91, a 1992 Olympic Silver Medalist, and Emily A. Hughes ’11-12, a 2006 Olympian, co-hosted the event. 
“When I was younger and coming up in the ranks I remember that the elite skaters would come to this event,” said Jeremy D. Abbott, a three-time national champion who headlined the event. “If you were invited to an Evening with Champions it meant you were really good.”
The event, which was hosted at the Bright Hockey Center, attracted both Harvard students and community members, although it did not sell all of its seats.
“We may not have Yuna Kim’s name to bring in a lot of the audience members, but we still have a very talented cast this year,” co-chair Amanda J. Black ’14 said. 
The EWC team raised money for the Jimmy Fund through ticket sales, corporate sponsor donations, a silent auction, and Skating with Champions—a new contest that gave skaters who raised the most money a spot in the evening’s show.
Skating with Champion’s winner Caterina Alf raised $4,000. Overall, the contest raised $10,000. 
“It was only the first year [of the contest], so hopefully we’ll get even more money from that in the future,” Black said.
With music ranging from Beyoncé to Footloose, the show included a wide variety of skating styles. Jason L. Brown elicited laughter from the crowd as he skated to “Can’t Touch This.”
This year, there were two current Harvard students in the show: Blake K. Rosenthal ’14 and Christina H. Gao ’16.
Now a long-time Harvard Tradition, EWC draws many of the same skaters year after year. Audience members and former ice-dancers Nancy Albert and Richard J. Albert have been coming to the show since it first began 42 years ago.
“We love to see the skaters achieve some measure of success, and it’s fun to watch the kids,” Richard said. “My wife and I still ice-dance and still love it. Also, we still have all of our joints, so we still can.”

A chorus of “shaloms” greeted attendees of Galit Hasan-Rokem’s lecture on the interplay between Greco-Roman folklore and rabbinic interpretation of the Bible on Friday at the Barker Center.
The roughly twenty guests at the event, titled “Singing with Sirens,” were welcomed with complimentary Middle Eastern-style sandwiches, wraps, brownies, and soft drinks. The audience represented an array of backgrounds, including guest professors from Hebrew University in Jerusalem and students at the College.
“I am excited to come and have a discussion with eminent scholars and bright graduate students whom I’ve met here,” said Hasan-Rokem, a professor emerita of folklore at Hebrew University.
Discussing the relationship between Greco-Roman folklore and ancient rabbinic texts, Hasan-Rokem talked about the interdependence of the cultures, emphasizing the influence of a specific figure from Greco-Roman folklore: the sirens.
The sirens and other Greco-Roman tropes, Hasan-Rokem said, influenced the rabbinic view of women as alluring and punishable. She noted that the oral transmission of information in rabbinic culture facilitated the incorporation of new voices and ideas. 
Stephanie P. Spence ’14, a Near Eastern languages and civilizations concentrator, said the lecture shed light on on how ancient folklore influenced rabbinic interpretations of the Bible. 
“It allows us to piece together the symbiosis of the cultures and show how we can allegorically read the Bible and pull from the other cultures,” she said.
The lecture also served to reach out to surrounding fields, reflecting Hasan-Rokem’s belief in the importance of interdisciplinary studies.
“Studying the folklore of different cultures is an interesting way of studying critically the cultural diversity of a country,” she said. “It entails not just the most hegemonic or dominant and hierarchical studies of texts.”
This interdisciplinary focus appealed to the Harvard professors who brought Hasan-Rokem to give the talk.
“This year’s seminar is a perfect opportunity for everyone to come together,” said Rachel L. Greenblatt, associate professor of Near Eastern languages and civilizations and head coordinator of the seminar. “What Jewish studies has been trying to do in general for the last few years is to really work with other departments in the humanities.”
Hasan-Rokem will spend the rest of the semester at Williams College in western Massachusetts.

For history teaching fellow Sandy I. Plácido, one of the organizers of the Reconsidering Caribbean Diaspora conference at the Barker Center over the weekend, the conference was “definitely a personal and an academic interest.”
 
Plácido, whose family is from the Dominican Republic, focuses on the Caribbean in her academic work. The conference, she said, aimed to bring together a “newer, younger” generation of scholars who study the Caribbean Diaspora. 
 
“Because all of the presenters are graduate students, our idea was to bring together young scholars who are doing work on the Caribbean and Caribbean diaspora, to speak to this issue and maybe challenge the concept of diaspora as well,” she said.
 
The conference included a keynote address and roundtable discussion Friday night, followed by a series of eight panels on Saturday, where 24 graduate students presented papers on the Caribbean. 
 
Robert A. Hill, a professor emeritus in history at the University of California, Los Angeles, was the keynote speaker.
 
 “If you want to talk about race in the 20th or 21st century, you have to default to an American discourse of race. They control the discourse of race,” he said. “In other words, we are dealing with a form of intellectual and cultural imperialism.”
 
Hill also discussed discrepancies across different demographics of membership within the Universal Negro Improvement Association, an organization founded by Marcus Garvey in 1914 which he has studied extensively. 
 
“Why? We don’t know,” he said. “So get to work!”
 
Aisha M. Beliso-De Jesús, an assistant professor of African American religions at the Divinity School who participated in the roundtable discussion, spoke about the changing notion of diaspora. 
 
“We have started thinking about diaspora…as the globalized relationships of power, not only within a few different cases, but in the ways people imagine homeland, and experience and think about it,” she said.
 
Adom Getachew, a graduate student from Yale, said the multidisciplinary nature of the conference gave it wide appeal. 
 
“Of course, a lot of us here are specialists who are interested in this for very specific reasons, but hopefully if we do our job right, the idea is that anyone who is interested in modern intellectual history or culture should find something important about this topic,” she said.
 
Christopher S. Taylor, a graduate student from Western University in Ontario whose family is from Barbados, agreed with Plácido’s sentiment about the conference’s dual meaningfulness.
 
“The personal supports the academic, and the academic supports the personal,” Taylor said. “My life and my work are symbiotic. You can’t separate the two; it’s who I am.”

Maternal mortality took center stage at the Harvard School of Public Health in a forum discussion moderated by reporter and Huffington Post columnist Lisa Belkin last Friday.
The discussion, which was co-hosted by HSPH and the Huffington Post, included advocate and former model Christy Turlington Burns, Dean of the School of Public Health Julio Frenk, and Coordinator of the Dean's Special Initiative in Women and Health Ana Langer.
The forum drew a crowd of about 40 people and was simultaneously broadcast live through the HSPH online forum, which allowed experts and activists from around the world to participate in the discussion and ask questions in an effort to pool resources and knowledge about maternal mortality.
“I look forward to hearing what other groups of professionals are doing about this issue,” said Holly E. Rawizza, a research fellow at HSPH who said she has been involved in women’s health projects in Africa for seven years.
“Women are the key solution to the problem,” said Frenk, emphasizing that women can serve as advocates for themselves and others to increase awareness of issues related to maternal health.
Drawing from his experience as former Health Minister of Mexico, Frenk said that maternal mortality can serve as a stepping stone in a broader campaign to address women’s health in the developing world.
HSPH student Sara C. Jenks said she appreciated that Frenk recognized that maternal mortality is the tip of the iceberg in understanding women’s health. “I thought it was really fascinating when Frenk mentioned how women who don’t die during childbirth will be the ones who will have other diseases later in life,” Jenks said.
Langer stressed the importance of attacking the problem on both medical and social fronts. “Women are not considered an asset that is valuable enough to invest what needs to be invested in terms of eradicating preventable maternal death,” she said.
As director of the Maternal Health Task Force program, Langer said she hopes to promote the training of a new generation of health experts in countries heavily affected by maternal mortality.
Burns, founder of the campaign Every Mother Counts and director of the documentary film “No Woman No Cry,” emphasized the importance of advocacy. “Information is empowerment,” she said.
Burns, who is best known for her modeling career, said during the forum that she believes that people need to understand maternal mortality as a “global tragedy” where “everybody is a stakeholder in the life of everybody else.”
In an interview with the Crimson, Burns said that her mission is far from accomplished. “I’ll be out there, I’ll do what I can to have more of an impact,” she said.

In preparation for Harvard football’s first night-game of the year, the staff and clergy at Memorial Church gathered for the inaugural Sparks House tailgate, braving the rain that put a slight damper on the celebration.
 
“Bummer about the rain,” said Lucia R. Hulsether, a second-year student at the Divinity School and seminarian at Memorial Church. “It was a little bit of a bust the first day,” she added, “but look for us next home game—you have a rain check.”
 
Despite of the inclement weather, there was a strong turnout from Memorial Church’s congregational community and freshmen students who intended to use the tailgate as an opportunity to hold a joint entryway study-break.
 
“Rain can’t stop fun and fellowship,” said Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, the recently appointed Pusey Minister and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals.
 
“There’s a biblical verse that says wherever two or three are gathered, I am one in the mix,” he added. “All you need is two or three people and you have fellowship.”
 
Matthew J. Disler ’16, one of the attendees, said that several of his freshmen community events have previously been hosted at Memorial Church.
 
“My entryway has spent a lot of time in the Church both for study breaks and for Community Conversations at the beginning of the year,” he said. “It’s really cool, I’m glad they make the space available. I’ll probably be attending future tailgates.” 
 
The tailgates were designed to create an opportunity for students to get to know the Church and its community, part of a larger initiative to better integrate the Church with the student body. The event was originally slated to be held at Sparks House, but was moved to the Church due to the rain.
 
Christine E. Whiteside, an administrative assistant, likened the Church to a colonial New England meetinghouse.
 
“The meetinghouses were places of worship first and foremost, but they were also the central meeting point for everything else that happened in the community,” she said. “That’s what we hope Memorial Church can be more like. We want it to be welcoming—where people can celebrate, study, worship, sing, and tailgate.”
 
Nathaniel P. Katz, the Epps Fellow at Memorial Church, emphasized the community-building benefits of the tailgates and of MemChurch Café, which will replace the former Wednesday Tea tradition.
 
“At the end of the day, the idea behind the Tea—hospitality—will never expire, but in that iteration it was really dependent on [the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes] and his spirit,” Katz said. “I’m hoping that the tailgates are going to be a sort of new, visible, engaging opportunity for people to explore the Church community.”
 
The tailgate was the first in a series of events that Walton and the Memorial Church staff plan to host at Sparks House over the course of the semester.
 
“We’re going to be throwing parties for every football home game and absolutely for the upcoming basketball season,” Walton said. “I might even paint my body for that,” he added.

The Harvard field hockey team put together its first winning streak and earned its first Ivy League victory along the way, defeating Brown (2-6, 0-3 Ivy) in a tense 1-0 battle on Saturday afternoon at Brown.
But the Crimson’s streak came to an end one day later, as Harvard (3-5, 1-2 Ivy) fell to Quinnipiac, 3-1, on Sunday at Jordan Field.
QUINNIPIAC 3, HARVARD 1
In the second leg of back-to-back games, Harvard stumbled against Quinnipiac (6-4) on a drizzly Sunday at Jordan Field.
In open play, not much separated the two teams—the number of shots and penalty corners for both squads were nearly identical.
But the Bobcats enjoyed a substantial advantage in the execution of their penalty corners, scoring three goals and rarely encountering much trouble from the Crimson’s attacks.
“We knew ahead of time their corner attack is something that’s very difficult to play defense on because they use the numbers situation, and they take care of the rebounds,” coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said.
Though Harvard scored its only goal of the day off of a penalty corner, cashing in on freshman Elizabeth Jacobson’s redirection of a pass from junior Bridget McGillivray, the team was unable to muster many more serious threats to the Quinnipiac cage from their nine other penalty corner opportunities.
“We depend on [penalty corners] quite a bit [for offense],” van Herwaarden said. “It’s any given day from that perspective. We will work on it because we have to get more out of our corners.”
The Bobcats were much more clinical with their finishing. The first goal of the game came from Cate Colucci, who put a rebound in the back of the cage after two saves from co-captain Cynthia Tassopoulos.
The second Quinnipiac goal came off of a wide-open slashed effort from Amanda Danziger, and the third was a deflection to the top of the short side of the cage from Jess Rusin to put the game out of reach with under three minutes to play.
HARVARD 1, BROWN 0
After beating Bryant last Monday, the Crimson carried its momentum to Providence, as Harvard scored late and Tassopoulos recorded her second shutout of the season.
The only goal of the day came from the stick of senior forward Emma Keller, assisted by sophomore forward Noel Painter in the 65th minute.
“It was really close to the end of the game,” Painter said. “[Sophomore Caitlin] Rea got the ball in the center and she went to pass it. I got the ball and passed it to my right to Emma who [shot it] and she nutmegged her, got through the goalie’s legs and into the back of the cage.”
The Bears controlled much of the pace in the first half, outshooting the Crimson, 10-6, as Tassopoulos, who entered the weekend with the eighth best save percentage in the nation, improved on her mark of .800 by making seven saves, five of which came in the opening half.
The momentum shifted over to Harvard in the second frame, as the visitors outshot Brown 8-5 in the period. Keller, Rea, and Jacobson all led the team with three shots apiece.
“Our defense was rock solid especially against their forwards,” Painter said. “Cynthia did a great job in net, she had some really key saves that helped us get our momentum, and I think our momentum in the second half started in the backfield with their outletting and their working up through the mid[fielders] and through the forwards.”
The Crimson was able to withstand a late push by Brown, holding the Bears off on penalty corners in the final seconds of game. Brown ended up having nine total corners to Harvard’s five, and outshot the Crimson, 15-14.
Despite its losing record more than half way into the season, van Herwaarden was pleased with the progress the team has made thus far and expects positive results from its efforts soon.
“We’ve already shown significant improvement,” van Herwaarden said. “I think it’s time that we right now trust ourselves a little bit more and believe in ourselves that the improvement is there. We should consider ourselves being good enough to compete with every team in this nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With his in-depth report of Barack Obama ballin' on the FBI basketball courts, Michael Lewis, who shadowed the President for six months, inspired us to do some digging into Obama’s past pick-up career. Described as “the trash-talker with a left-handed jump shot” by NPR, Obama has now transformed his ‘trash-talk’ into some of the most eloquent speeches given in American history. Will Obama’s loud mouth come out in his upcoming debates against Mitt Romney? What other parts of his game has the Commander in Chief incorporated into his presidency?
 
In a Dallas Morning News article comparing the two 2012 presidential candidates, Obama’s former classmate, Hill Harper, said, “If there was any knock against Barack, he pulled his socks up a little too high and his shorts were a little too small.” Well, we think (and hope) that the President’s style has definitely improved with time and a White House stylist. Although the image of Obama knocking back jump shots at Hemenway Gym in ’80’s style gear is still pretty awesome. 
 
While at Harvard Law School, Obama played for the Black Law Students’ Association. In one of the team’s scheduled games, the President was starting at center against the opposing squad from Wapole prison. Obama reportedly asked an inmate what got him to Wapole, and he received the reply, “Double murder.” The President ex’d his signature jump-shot-trash-talk combo. It seems that even the future leader of the free world can be shaken by an intimidating opponent. Maybe Mitt should take some notes. 
 
The President’s opponents have ranged from inmates to Secretary of Education and former captain of the Harvard basketball team Arne Duncan. One aspect of Obama’s game has remained the same, and that is his love for a challenge. In all his time on the basketball court, whether it be with Washington elites or other HLS students at Hemenway, the President does not like to have others take it easy on him. Lewis was told, when he himself was participating in one of Obama’s pick-up games, that if anyone  did not play hard, he was not asked to play again. 
 
Even though Obama’s love of basketball has moved from Hemenway to the FBI, its intensity has stayed the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was not the Middle Ages nor even yet the middle of the season, but the Harvard football team was on a crusade of its own Friday night, and there was nothing Holy Cross could do to stop it.
Despite playing in a driving rain under the lights at Harvard Stadium, the Crimson (3-0) offense was absolutely dominant, scoring a program-record 49 first-half points before pulling its starters for the final two quarters of the 52-3 rout.
Harvard moved the ball with ease as the Crusader (0-4) defense simply could not get itself off the field. The Crimson went nine for nine on third downs during the half, scoring touchdowns on all six of its possessions and adding a touchdown off a blocked punt for good measure.
“I didn’t see a single positive thing we did on that field tonight,” Crusaders coach Tom Gilmore said.
In his first-ever start, junior wide receiver Ricky Zorn led the team with a career-high six catches for 99 yards. Senior quarterback Colton Chapple hit Zorn over the middle on a 10-yard slant for the game’s first score just 2:11 into the contest, and from there, Harvard was off and running.
The Crimson outgained Holy Cross 394 yards to 92 during the first two quarters as Chapple threw for 260 and four touchdowns while adding a three-yard rushing score as well.
The four touchdown passes placed the senior one shy of the Crimson all-time record, which he tied last season against Bucknell.
Junior tight end Cameron Brate grabbed two of those touchdowns, finding a seam over the middle and beating a linebacker on the first and getting open in the left corner of the end zone on the second.
By the time the clock wound down to halftime, Harvard had already put the game away, surpassing the points record it previously set on Nov. 5, 2005, at Columbia. The victory gave Harvard a bit of revenge for its 30-22 season-opening loss to Holy Cross last season—its only defeat in its last 13 games.
“Harvard’s a very good football team,” Gilmore said. “I give them all the credit in the world.... It’s rare you can find a team that can execute that consistently at that level.”
SOLID STAN-DIN
One of the most impressive performances during the victory came from true freshman Paul Stanton Jr., who had two big sets of shoes to fill Friday night.
The first pair came as a kick returner, as Stanton was giving the job of replacing preseason All-American Seitu Smith, who was out Friday night.
Against the Crusaders, the rookie proved to be a more than suitable fill-in. On his first-ever collegiate touch, Stanton ran the opening kick back 42 yards, setting his team up with solid field position to begin the game.
But it was in the backfield where the freshman really shined. He took over the bulk of the groundwork late in the second quarter and immediately impressed, rushing for 33 yards on his first two carries to set up Harvard’s seventh touchdown.
“He gave us a huge lift,” Murphy said. “He showed us he’s a real player at this level.”
In the second half, Stanton continued to play well, finding big holes and breaking numerous tackles to help him collect 43 more yards on just six carries—a 7.2 yards per attempt average.
The freshman set himself up for a potentially increased workload down the stretch, which could give the Crimson a powerful one-two punch similar to the one it had last season with current senior Treavor Scales and Zach Boden, then another freshman standout running back who has not played this season.
“We would like to balance the running game [in the future],” Murphy said. “But it’s not an easy decision to take Treavor off the field.”
TOTAL D-OMINANCE
Not to be overshadowed by the offense’s record-breaking performance was the play of the Harvard defense, though the unit struggled on the Crusaders’ opening drive. A blown coverage allowed a 65-yard pass to Nate Stanley down the right sideline on Holy Cross’ first play from scrimmage, and the defense then allowed Reed Apfelbaum to get wide open in the end zone on the Crusaders’ next play.
But Holy Cross quarterback Ryan Laughlin underthrew Apfelbaum, the road team was forced to settle for a field goal after two more Crimson stops, and from there, the Crimson defense dominated the rest of the evening.
The unit held the Crusaders to a 3-for-16 conversion rate on third down (1 for 8 in the first half) and allowed just 2.7 yards per carry. Under consistent pressure—Harvard had four sacks on the game—Laughlin completed just 8 of 24 passes for 40 yards after the opening bomb to Stanley.
“It started first with stopping the run, which is the staple of our defense,” said fifth-year senior defensive end John Lyon. “It was very exciting to be able to go out there and have a great defensive effort like we did. Our defense has a lot of pride, and that’s something that we want to try to do each week.”

The Harvard men’s soccer team dominated Yale in many aspects of the teams’ contest Saturday night under the lights at Soldiers Field Lacrosse/Soccer Stadium—but not the one most important measure. The Crimson outshot the Bulldogs, 23-11, and tallied a whopping 20 corner kicks. But Harvard couldn’t capitalize on the outpouring of shots, tying Yale, 0-0, and extending its winless streak to five games.
“We came out and our first priority was to get the shutout and we did that, so we’re happy about that,” co-captain Scott Prozeller said. “But we’re definitely not happy about the result.”
With Harvard unable to get one past Bulldog goalie Bobby Thalman in regulation, the teams went to overtime. In the extra period, Yale (3-4-3, 0-0-1 Ivy) packed its backline and prevented an aggressive Harvard team from breaking the deadlock.
Twice the Crimson (1-5-2, 0-0-1) nearly beat Thalman, but luck was not on its side. Junior Kyle Henderson’s rocket of a shot left the left post shaking, and Harvard failed to take advantage of an overtime error in which Thalman bobbled and then dropped the ball in front of net.
“We knew we’d have a lot of the ball, [and] we knew we’d create a lot of chances off of set pieces,” Harvard coach Carl Junot said. “I think the message is that it’s not good enough though. We need someone to step up and win us the game.”
Following one of the hardest non-conference schedules in the nation, the Crimson showed an offensive fluidity on Saturday that had been missing through much of the season so far.
Harvard kept the ball in Yale’s half for most of the game, with junior defender Ross Friedman’s throws and sophomore defender David Barna’s free kicks sailing into the box time and again, creating opportunity after opportunity.
“We’ve been playing some of the very best teams in the country, and when you do that, they limit your chances,” Junot said. “We believed we would be creating a lot of chances, just because we’ve been testing ourselves against the best.
“We have that kind of quality in our team, so I don’t think we’ve changed anything,” Junot added. “It’s just a matter of being able to execute what we’ve been working on a little more cleanly.”
Defensively, holding midfielder Prozeller and a solid back-line kept in check by co-captain Richard Smith limited the Bulldogs’ chances and forced freshman goalie Joe Festa to make only four saves all night.
“We communicated well, dealt with their big guy up top,” said Prozeller, referring to Jenner Fox. “We were organized and contained, so I think defensively it was a good performance.”
Festa got his third start of the year as he has shared time with classmate Evan Mendez. Festa has the edge in save percentage, .769 to .636, and Mendez has already received two red cards in his five starts. But Junot is not ready to give him the full-time job just yet.
“I think the answer right now is healthy competition at goalkeeper,” Junot said. “Both goalkeepers have played big games and both have done well in different games, so I don’t think there’s a single answer right now. More than likely we’re going to rely on both keepers throughout the rest of the year.”
Referee Chi Chi Ogbenta kept control of a feisty game between the two bitter rivals, dishing out five yellow cards and not allowing any physicality to escalate.
Around the Ivy League, Cornell and Brown both won, cementing their spots as the favorites in the Ancient Eight.
After a winless 2011 conference campaign, the Crimson is somewhat of an unknown commodity but appears to be hitting its stride entering Ivy League play.
“You can’t drop points in the Ivy League, and we have at least one now,” Prozeller said. “But we’ve got to win games. You have to win games to win the Ivy League, so that’s our goal moving forward.”
With a cohesive defense and the offensive looking stronger, the final step for Harvard is to find someone who can capitalize on the abundance of chances and create some noise offensively.
“We have guys that have scored goals and can score goals,” Junot said. “We’re playing well and we’re creating opportunities. When goals aren’t being scored, the key is to keep creating opportunities. Eventually they’ll start going in.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s volleyball team split the first two home games of its Ivy League season this past weekend, earning its first conference win over Penn after falling to Princeton a day earlier.
Against the Quakers (6-8, 1-2 Ivy), the Crimson rallied to a five-set win, 16-25, 25-15, 17-25, 25-22, 15-13, Saturday evening at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“Moving on, this is a great confidence booster,” said freshman outside hitter Kathleen Wallace after Harvard’s win over Penn.
The night before, Harvard finished on the other end of a five-set match against the Tigers (6-7, 3-0), who defeated the Crimson, 25-23, 22-25, 24-26, 25-21, 15-8.
Harvard (4-10, 1-2) will continue its homestand with matches against Brown (3-9, 0-3) and Yale (7-5, 3-0) next weekend.
HARVARD 3, PENN 2
A wave of joy and relief swept over the Crimson after sophomore middle blocker Caroline Walters punched in the match point to clinch Harvard’s first five-set win of 2012.
“Because we’ve lost a few fifth games [this season], I think we were all really tense near the end,” said junior right side Erin Cooney.  “But when we won that, there was so much excitement and emotion.”
The Crimson and the Quakers traded blows early as momentum shifted frequently between the two teams.  The Quakers opened with a 25-16 first-set win, before Harvard responded, 25-15, in the second.
After losing the third set, 25-17, the Crimson fought to stay in the match.  Harvard responded to an early 13-6 deficit with a 6-0 run to keep the set close. Down 20-19 later in the set, the Crimson notched three straight kills before Penn tied the set, 22-22.
But Harvard won the last three points to take the fourth set, 25-22, forcing a fifth.
“I think it was a really big game-changer for us because we were down a lot,” Cooney said. “Being able to come back from that and bring it to a fifth game really gave us the momentum to win.”
A back-and-forth fifth frame involved seven ties and four lead changes.  But the Crimson seized control at just the right moment, scoring the final two points of the match to edge the Quakers, 15-13.
“I think this is the best way we could have [won our first Ivy League game of the season], overcoming our fifth-game barrier,” Wallace said.  “I think we’ve proved to ourselves that we can win the fifth game when we compete.”
Wallace and captain outside hitter Taylor Docter led Harvard with 14 kills apiece, and Docter, senior setter Beth Kinsella, and freshman setter Hannah Schmidt each recorded their second double-doubles of the weekend. Kinsella and junior setter and defensive specialist Natalie Doyle had a team-leading 19 and 18 digs, respectively.  Cooney also contributed 13 kills for the Crimson.
Penn’s junior libero Dani Sheperd, who leads NCAA Division I players in digs per set, tallied a game-high 25 digs.  Quaker sophomore outside hitter Emma White had 16 kills, tops for both squads.
PRINCETON 3, HARVARD 2
The Crimson dropped a close first set, 25-23, before edging the Tigers, 25-22, in the second.  In the third set, Harvard rallied from two set points and won the next four points to win the game, 26-24, off of a kill by freshman middle blocker Caroline Holte.
“I think that was the most fun point of the game because we proved we can come back from a deficit,” Holte said. “We found it within ourselves rather than focus on the other side. We decided to win.”
But Princeton responded with a win in a back-and-forth fourth set that involved five lead changes, sending the match to a fifth game.
The Tigers carried their momentum to the fifth and opened the set on a 7-1 run before wrapping up the match with a 15-8 set win.
Docter led the Crimson with 18 kills, while sophomore libero and outside hitter Kristen Casey led all players with 21 digs.  Kinsella and Schmidt also recorded double-doubles.
For Princeton, freshman right side and middle blocker Kendall Peterkin and tri-captain outside hitter Lydia Rudnick led all players with 27 and 25 kills, respectively.
Friday night marked the second five-set loss in Harvard’s first two matches of the Ivy League season.  The Crimson lost to Dartmouth, 3-2, in its Ivy League opener on Sept. 21.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the second installment of a new weekly series, we break down the ins and out of the Harvard football team. This week, we dissect how Crimson receivers have been getting open against opposing defenses.
Through three weeks of play, senior quarterback Colton Chapple has averaged nearly 10 yards per passing attempt en route to seven touchdowns through the air compared to just one interception. Five receivers have eight catches and over 140 yards thanks to their ability to spread opposing defenders out and find the open space that is sure to come as a result. Even Brown's preseason All-American cornerback A.J. Cruz could not stop the potent Harvard attack.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After failing to score in regulation, the Harvard women’s soccer team wasted little time finding the back of the net in the extra period. Just over four minutes into overtime, sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke dribbled down the right side of the field and centered to sophomore midfielder Meg Casscells-Hamby, who drilled the ball into the upper right of the cage, giving Harvard a 1-0 win over Yale on Saturday at Soldiers Field Soccer/Lacrosse Stadium.
“The season is still alive,” said junior co-captain Peyton Johnson, whose squad lost its Ivy opener last weekend. “We knew coming into this game that our Ivy League hopes rode on this game, and from here on out we are chasing that. The [outcome] of the game re-instilled the belief that we have in this team in the best way possible.”
Both the Crimson (4-3-2, 1-1 Ivy) and the Bulldogs (5-5, 0-2) struggled to put the ball away for most of the match, with Harvard taking 25 shots (nine on goal) compared to Yale’s five.
In the first seven minutes of play, senior defender Taryn Kurcz, working off a through-ball pass, fired a shot toward  goal, but freshman goalkeeper Rachel Ames blocked the attempt.
The Crimson had another chance on goal later in the first half when senior midfielder Alicia Johnson crossed the ball into the 18-yard box to find sophomore forward Erica Garcia, who volleyed a shot just high of the crossbar. Harvard outshot Yale, 9-3, at the end of the first half.
“At halftime we had started off really strong, and then in the last 15 minutes or so it had become a more even game,”Johnson said. “So we were determined to come out with the same intensity we had in the beginning, and I think we definitely did that.”
With the ball predominately on the Bulldog defensive half during the second 45-minute period, the Crimson offense had many looks on goal, the first of which came five minutes into the half when Casscells-Hamby nailed a shot just left of the goalpost. Another attempt occurred in the 57th minute, when Casscells-Hamby crossed the ball into the box where Urke volleyed a shot into Ames’ hands.
In the 72nd minute of the match, Johnson rocketed a shot off a loose ball in the 18-yard box but missed to the right. Harvard’s final attempt on goal of the second half came from junior forward Elizabeth Weisman, but Ames stopped the shot.
In total during the second half, the Crimson had more scoring opportunities, outshooting the Bulldogs, 13-1. Despite several key throw-ins into the 18-yard box by senior midfielder Aisha Price and three corner kicks from Johnson, Harvard failed to capitalize and entered into overtime with the score tied at 0-0.
Entering into a 10-minute overtime period, the Crimson continued to relentlessly pressure the Bulldog defense.
“We forced 45 straight minutes of pressure [in the second half], not letting them out of their defensive half,” Johnson said. “Going into overtime there wasn’t even kind of a game plan or any motivational speech. We had all the momentum we needed, and it was just a matter of breaking through.”
Harvard’s first offensive attack came in the third minute of overtime when Weisman powered the ball down the middle of the field.
She fired a shot on target that Ames fumbled before regaining possession. Thirty seconds later, Yale had an opportunity on goal, but Bulldog freshman forward Paula Hagopian missed a shot just high of the crossbar.
Finally, in the fifth minute of overtime, sophomore midfielder Lauren Urke centered the ball from the right side, and Casscells-Hamby found contact and powered a right-footed shot into the goal, ending the game with a Crimson victory.
“I think we’re just going to continue to work on connecting between the midfielders and the forwards so that we can do what we want to do, which is put the ball in the net,” Urke said.
In 90 minutes of regulation play and six minutes of overtime, Harvard outshot Yale, 25-5. Although the Bulldogs had the edge over the Crimson on corner kicks, 5-3, the Yale offense never had a single shot on target throughout the match.
“We definitely wouldn’t have been able to do as well as we did in the game without the backline,” Urke said. “They did awesome at not only stopping the attack but winning the ball and taking the ball.”
With the win over its rival, Harvard improved to 1-1 in Ivy play, one game back of undefeated Princeton, Penn, and Columbia.
“It’s a historic rivalry, so we always look forward to this game,” Johnson said. “I’m glad it went the way it did.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One squad relied on depth; the other relied on experience. But when all was said and done, both the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams notched 13th-place finishes at the Paul Short Invitational this past weekend, hosted by Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa.
With many of the squad’s elite runners held out of competition for the week, the men’s team put its deep roster on display at the invite. Toeing the line against one of the largest fields it will see all season, the relatively inexperienced Crimson squad scored 421 points to finish just two behind 12th-place Duquesne University.
On the women’s side, some familiar faces led the way for Harvard. Junior Morgan Kelly was the team’s first finisher, coming in 26th place with a time of 21:00. The women’s squad tallied 414 points en route to its 13th-place showing.
In the absence of classmates Maksim Korolev and James Leakos, who finished in first and second place, respectively, at the Harvard-Yale dual meet two weekends ago, junior Kurt Ruegg paced the Crimson men on Friday.
Ruegg crossed the finish line in 24:37 to come in 25th.
“Kurt’s put in a great summer of training,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “He’s really fit, and I think he’s only going to get faster as the season goes.... It’s really exciting.”
Saretsky said that the men’s top seven finishers from the Harvard-Yale meet, including Korolev, Leakos, and senior Jakob Lindaas, were held out of Friday’s race to avoid overuse and injury.
“We’ve got a long season ahead of us,” Saretsky said. “The meets that matter most, the meets that count, are at the end of the season. We’re gearing everyone up for that. I feel really good with where we’re at.”
Behind Ruegg for the Harvard men was freshman Thomas Purnell, who finished 41st with a time of 24:52.
“I thought [Purnell] had a great, great showing,” Saretsky said. “Going under 25 minutes in his first 8k is a great way to start the season.”
Despite his impressive finish, the rookie’s collegiate debut was not as seamless as it appears on paper.
“At one point, [Purnell] passed me and was like, ‘How much [distance] is left?’” Saretsky said. “He was running like a freshman out there, but as he gets more races under his belt, I think he’ll really come into his own.”
Classmate Christopher Allen was 45 seconds behind Purnell, covering the 8k course in 25:37.
“The entire freshman class has done an outstanding job of handling the transition [to college competition],” Saretsky said.
Rounding out the scoring for the Crimson were senior Sean Pohorence and sophomore Andy Gonzalez, who placed 114th and 133rd, respectively.
The rainy weather in Bethlehem leading up to the invitational made for unfavorable racing conditions. Runners had to find steady footing as they navigated the muddy five- and eight-kilometer trails on Lehigh’s Goodman Campus Course.
“It had rained heavily the night before and morning of the race, so the all-grass course was extremely muddy and slippery,” sophomore Alaina Alvarez said. “The course itself was moderately challenging and increasingly hilly, finishing [with] the last 2k mostly uphill.”
Alvarez and the rest of the women’s team had a solid outing at the invitational as well. Though the squad was outclassed by Ancient Eight rival Cornell, which won the women’s title with 55 points, one member of the team turned in possibly the best outing of her collegiate career.
“Morgan Kelly had an outstanding, breakthrough performance,” Saretsky said. “I’m really proud of how she performed.”
Saretsky said that Kelly, who has consistently been one of the Crimson’s top runners, was nursing a cold last week but was able to shake off the symptoms and compete in the race.
The other scoring runners for the Harvard women included Alvarez and classmates Viviana Hanley and Whitney Thornburg and senior Briana Jackucewicz, who finished in 61st, 70th, 155th, and 102nd places, respectively.
The Paul Short Invitational gave the Crimson teams a chance to race against nearly 700 runners competed at the meet.
“It was a tremendously large field,” Saretsky said. “It’s a great experience for our team. To have that under our belt is going to set us up really well for the rest of the season.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team was in striking distance throughout the weekend, just four strokes off the lead entering the final day of competition at the MacDonald Cup.
But the Crimson couldn’t make up any ground on Sunday, beginning and ending the day in fifth place. Harvard shot a 572 (+12) in the tournament, finishing eight behind host Yale.
Overall, the Crimson finished behind Hartford, St. John’s, and Notre Dame along with the Bulldogs.
“One of our goals this year was to be in contention a few times going into the last day to feel the pressure of trying to win,” junior captain Theo Lederhausen said. “We definitely were in that position [Sunday]. We certainly had a chance and didn’t lose by much, so any weekend where you get close to winning like that is a good weekend moving forward.”
Fifteen teams competed at the Course at Yale in New Haven, which was recently named the No. 1 college golf course in America by Golfweek magazine. Conditions were difficult during the weekend, with the practice round cancelled on Friday due to 1 ½ inches of rain.
“When we teed off, the ball was just going to hit the ground and stop, so you are losing a lot of distance,” junior Seiji Liu said. “That really changed the way you are going to approach this course, so we just recalculated our strategy, and it worked out. It paid off for us.”
Liu was the overall top scorer for Harvard, shooting one-under-par 139 after an even-par 70 on Sunday. He was tied for the second in the tournament with Bulldog junior Brad Kushner and trailing the individual leader junior Niall Platt of Notre Dame by one stroke.
“I just focused a lot on process and control and staying in the zone,” Liu said. “I was very sharp mentally this weekend, and that contributed a lot to tackling this difficult course that we normally have trouble with, so it was nice to be able to execute on that.”
Sophomore Akash Mirchandani displayed consistency over the weekend, shooting a 71 (+1) in both rounds for an overall 142, good for a tie for 15th overall.
Lederhausen completed his final round shooting a 70 to finish tied for 22nd place with 143 (+3).
“I stayed even-keeled pretty well throughout the weekend, and I definitely fought it out,” Lederhausen said. “I had a knee injury that I was dealing with; [Saturday] was really difficult [as] I was in a lot of pain, but I just kept playing solid and fought it out.”
Freshman Un Cho finished the second round with a score of 78, eight strokes higher than his first-round performance. That moved him into a tie for 39th place overall at eight over.
“[Sunday] he might have felt a little more pressure, which is understandable,” Lederhausen said. “His driving has been sometimes a little inconsistent throughout the season, so that caused him some problems today, but other than that I thought he played great.”
Junior Kevin McCarthy, who finished fifth among the Harvard golfers both days and therefore did not factor into the scoring, tied for 67th place at 14 over.
Rain shortened the originally scheduled 54-holes, as an 18-hole round was cancelled on Saturday and the field set out to play one single round for the day.
Central Connecticut led the pack after one round with a one-under-par 279. Hartford and Harvard were tied for fifth, four shots off the Blue Devis.
Liu was the top scorer for the Crimson in round one, shooting a one-under-par 69, good for a tie for ninth place.
On the first day of his second collegiate tournament, Cho shot even par, one behind Liu and tied for 13th place.
“He definitely showed his potential,” Lederhausen said. “He’s fitting in well with college golf so far and adjusting to it well.”
Mirchandani and Lederhausen rounded out the scoring for Harvard, with scores of 71 and 73 to tie for 19th place and 34th place, respectively.
For the Crimson, this tournament was also step towards the culmination of the transition to new head coach Kevin Rhoads.
“It was a really good showing for us based on how hard we’ve worked this entire season and how we’ve built up as a team under new leadership,” Liu said.
Liu attributes much of the success to structural shifts in practice that haven’t been implemented as much in past, which includes several 18-hole qualifying rounds during the week to keep up competition and motivation as well as skill-building days to focus on strengths and address member’s weaknesses.
“I think it came together,” Liu said. “[There was] a lot of positive things we saw this weekend.”

A new and exciting development: Today, the Lowell bells rang a slightly off-pitch but still recognizable version of Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe." They followed it up by what sounded to this Crimson editor like a bit of the Dropkick Murphys' "Shipping up to Boston."
We're really, really hoping they'll play "Rumor Has It" by Adele. Please.

Students interested in learning more about Greek cuisine—the mother of all Mediterranean diets—are invited to attend chef and cookbook author Diane Kochilas's food event on Thursday.
Sponsored by the Food Literacy Project and the Harvard Hellenic Society, the event will feature live demonstration and tasting of different types of mezes, or small Greek dishes. According to Kochilas's website, Greek cuisine relies heavily on ingredients like extra virgin olive oil, honey, yogurt, and seafood that are thought to have many health benefits.
Kochilas's website speaks to her interest in Greek food.
"My life's mission is to do for Greek cuisine what Julia Child did for French cooking: to bring my deep knowledge and passion for the Mediterranean's healthiest food to an American audience," the website reads. 
In addition to serving as consulting chef at three Greek restaurants in New York City, New Jersey, and Chicago, Kochilas has written 18 books on Greek cuisine and has appeared on TV shows like "Throwdown with Bobby Flay," "Bizarre Foods," and "PBS News Hour."
 
The event, which is limited to undergraduates, will be held at Hastings Room in Pforzheimer House from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Thursday. Students can RSVP here. There are very few tickets remaining, so reserve fast!

Those in leadership positions self-report lower anxiety levels and have cortisol levels 27 percent lower than non-leaders, according to a recent study by seven academics from Harvard, Stanford and the University of California at San Diego.
To test these findings, Flyby walked around Harvard Yard and randomly asked 20 people whether they considered themselves leaders or non-leaders and how stressed they were on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the most stressed. Exactly half identified themselves as leaders and, interestingly enough, those leaders reported higher stress levels than their subordinate counterparts. On average, leaders rated their stress at a 6.9, while non-leaders gave themselves a 5.7. Now, we wouldn't presume to have conducted a scientific survey, but it does suggest that, more so than elsewhere, leadership at Harvard means serious business!

Despite a recent dip in investment, Harvard's endowment is still doing alright at a respectable $30.7 billion. So just how much is 30 billion? Flyby took some time to investigate, and here's what we found:
Americans squandered $30 billion in lost cell phones in 2011. A big chunk of these damages occurred on Christmas and New Years. Happy holidays.
British consumers own £30 billion of unworn clothes. Technically that translates to $46.5 billion in US dollars, but regardless of the currency, that's a whole lot of sartorial waste.
As of June 2012, more than 30 billion apps have been downloaded from the Apple App Store. And so the legacy of Steve Jobs lives on in our collective distraction.
Greece needs another €30 billion in bailout money. Among other things.
An estimated 30 billion songs were illegally downloaded between 2004-2009. Given the coexistence of college students and the internet, we can't really say we're surprised.
It takes 30 billion watts of electricity to power the internet. The numbers aren't yet in on how many of these watts are used to power all the cat videos on YouTube.
It has been suggested that solving the world food crisis would cost $30 billion annually. So stop complaining about HUDS and enjoy your beef fajita fettuccine.
