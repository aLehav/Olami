After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
By the time Herman Koch’s protagonist chillingly invokes 9/11 in the final act of his unsettling “Dear Mr. M,” the Dutch novelist has already stacked a stunning number of familiar macabre tropes upon one another. A very partial sampling, in roughly chronological order: An unknown stalker writes lascivious letters to a famous author; a drunken 30-something stalks the gorgeous high school senior with whom he briefly had an affair; a cynical teen laughs while filming the sudden death of his physics teacher; and an aging megalomaniac belligerently defends his Nazi-sympathizing father. Taken as discrete plot developments, these moments feel trite at best, constants of a postmodern mystery landscape that aims more towards peddling pastiche than conjuring something new. Koch, however, is so capable a literary technician that he somehow manages to mold his collection of clichés into an enigmatic and unique intrigue that is simultaneously political and timeless, pulpy and profound.
The reader first glimpses Koch’s curmudgeonly protagonist, the titular Mr. M—a literary titan whose glory days are behind him—through the lens of the author’s downstairs neighbor. This creepy voyeur, about whom Koch reveals virtually nothing for the first half of the book, addresses a series of prying letters to the septuagenarian author, commenting on the beauty of Mr. M’s much younger wife while picking apart the bourgeois routine into which the once-creative wordsmith has fallen. The neighbor is at times unrelentingly cruel, bluntly criticizing the writer’s “mediocre intelligence,” highlighting obnoxious quotes from his most self-serving interviews, and even detailing the complicated means by which he plans to weasel his way into Mr. M’s apartment, summer home, and mail. At first glance, Koch’s novel seems like a by-the-book (if not particularly sordid) epistolary thriller, in which the breathless reader hopes that Mr. M can pacify his obsessive neighbor before the maniac kills his whole family!
Koch, however, tends to operate in a far more meta-modern mode. The author’s immensely popular 2009 novel, “The Dinner,” begins in a similarly clichéd form—a lurid dinner conversation between four morally ambiguous individuals relayed by a middle-aged history teacher—before devolving into a complex interior game of unreliable narrators and constantly shifting perspectives. Formal unpredictability is arguably the main attribute that has elevated Koch to such a vaunted position in the genre. In “Dear Mr. M,” it’s difficult to explain just how Koch architects his move away from his initial “found letter” cat-and-mouse game without revealing too many of the twists that make the book so exhilarating. Broadly, Koch complicates the opening section with a novella-length 1970s flashback sequence, which plays out a sinister love triangle between the letter-writer; his high school girlfriend, Laura; and a charming teacher at the school, who disappears under suspicious circumstances. To further fracture any sense of genre tradition, Koch reveals that Mr. M wrote his most popular novel as a speculative true-crime episode about the unsolved case.
So the neighbor has tracked down a literary enemy who misrepresented him in a famous work, has moved in downstairs, and is planning to take his sweet revenge to the tune of Koch’s slimy and salacious prose? No, not even close. In fact, Koch reveals in the early goings that the letter-writer’s becoming Mr. M’s neighbor was actually a coincidence: “In a novel, it would be completely implausible. Too much of a coincidence…. There’s only one place in which we accept coincidence, and that is in reality.” Let the meta games begin! For the rest of the book, Koch teases the reader with more of these morsels of literary theory, slyly commenting on his own plot developments and shifts in perspective as he tests the reader’s patience for ambiguity. Is Herman a killer? Is Mr. M in danger, or is he also hiding something? Who is actually in control of the narrative? Is Koch himself intentionally manipulating his reader to a degree that entirely undermines any coherent plot?
And then there’s 9/11, used as an extended metaphor that perhaps most acutely captures Koch’s modus operandi, his impressive ability to create confound readers’ expectations over large swaths of text. Koch prints the entirety of an interview that Mr. M gives comparing his writing to the World Trade Center catastrophe: “There is a fifteen-minute gap, a naïve eternity, between the first plane and the second…. As a writer, I’m much more interested in those minutes …. The naïve belief in the accident.” In his slow revelation that the neighbor is the subject of Mr. M’s novel, his conflicting versions of the 1970s love triangle, and his constant interior comment on the ridiculousness of the genre in which he is trapped, Koch plays on the assumption that someone will explain it all away eventually, that what looks like a morass of confusion will become a clear struggle between good and evil.
The only problem with Koch’s fascinating intertextual machinations is that his characters are repulsive to a degree that it becomes increasingly difficult to find common ground with them or trust their perspectives. The neighbor is a certifiable sadist regardless of whether or not he’s capable of killing, Mr. M is full of hot air, and the women in the book are rendered so lifeless by the male protagonists that it is hard to tell whether the sexism comes from the characters or, far more problematically, from Koch himself. Koch ties everything up and does so with flair, but readers are still left wondering whom to trust, why they were taken on such a ride, and whether humans are just downright nasty. But even this limitation appears intentional. After all, 9/11 wasn’t an accident but rather an endlessly confusing mess of ideologies and perspectives that continues to torture us 15 years on. It’s a gutsy metaphor for a mystery author to make about the trajectory of his own text, but with a novel this haunting it somehow works.

Ever since its October 2011 release, “American Horror Story” has been widely praised for its ability to blend unique, unexpected plot lines with an all-star cast. The show relies on the use of shock factor and frequent slips of nudity to attract viewers, as well as a cliffhanger at the end of every episode to make sure people tune in the next week. Last Wednesday, “American Horror Story” aired the premiere of its sixth season—six being a significant number in the world of horror—and demonstrated why many shows choose to cap their number of seasons at five.
The episode follows a multiracial couple who move to an eerie farm house in the-middle-of-nowhere, North Carolina, and (shocker!) begin to uncover that their house is, in fact, haunted. Not only is this disappointing, seeing as the first season of “American Horror Story” was actually titled “Murder House,” but it goes against the very essence of the show: A house being haunted is not unexpected or unique at all. Unlike “Murder House,” however, instead of being haunted by ghosts or goblins, the farmhouse is invaded by middle-aged white men sporting Puritan outfits and hoisting pitchforks. While white men are currently a rather frightening population in America, the series’ execution renders them comical, and I find myself amused rather than jumping in fear.
Interestingly, all of the episode’s happenings are explained in the style of a documentary, although the actors providing the commentary are not those experiencing the actions themselves. While this is probably an artistic choice which will make more sense in episodes to come, it is currently failing at its intended purpose. In fact, the premiere leaves many unexplained components. This may often be a useful tactic in keeping a viewer interested, but it is so greatly overused here that the episode simply renders one more and more perplexed.
“American Horror Story’s” past seasons have included psychotic happenings in asylums, a coven of sexy witches, and a very well-coiffed Matt Bomer. This season has included a farmhouse and the appearance of a bloody pig. Perhaps my expectations were too high. One thing the show did get right, however, is that it finally gave Sarah Paulson an adequate head of hair. Perhaps, however, they should have spent less time treating their actors to balayage highlights and more time crafting a gripping plotline.
I will continue to watch this season, primarily because Lady Gaga is expected to return, but also because I would like to see if Jessica Lange can finally, on her sixth attempt, play an interesting character. “American Horror Story” also has a habit of uncovering as they go, so while the season six premiere might have been terrible, its following episodes might still hold promise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Imagine, for a moment, being the king of some long-forgotten realm in its prime. Tired from a day of decision-making, you decide to follow the royal dog into the city. After a few twists and turns, the dog eventually stops at a traveling fair. You decide to visit the fortune teller, who prophesizes that one of your generals plots against you. Disgusted with this lunacy, you leave the caravan without paying and return to the keep to continue running your kingdom. The next day, after you decide to try eating strange mushrooms, the Devil possesses your dog and speaks to you.
This could all happen to you within your first few turns of “Reigns,” an indie game developed by Nerial Studios and recently released on Steam, iOS, and Android to the tune of a few bucks. The game places the player in the throne as the chief and principal decision-maker of the kingdom. Your decisions are brought to you in the form of cards; each card, presented by a character with their own mysterious motivations, is stylishly crowned with a minimalist depiction of that character (more on style later). Gameplay is relatively simple; you say yes or no to each decision, which has short-term and sometimes long-term consequences for your kingdom. You are responsible for managing meters representing four pillars of the realm: Faith, People, Military, and Money. If any of these fall to empty—or, in an interesting twist, if they rise to full—your king is deposed in some way or another and you take up the role of his successor.
Aside from flipping cards, the game employs an intermittently relevant combat mechanic with a similar binary choice presented to the player: defend or attack. This is fun at first and even tense for the initial few rounds. Ultimately, however, I found that there was not enough choice or nuance involved to keep me interested. Combat quickly became an annoyance, something that stood in the way of my return to the zany world of choices that awaited me.
And the world is certainly zany. The heart of the game lies in discovery: Meeting new characters or finding new lands adds cards to the deck, which helps to keep the game from stagnating, as well as encouraging players to make different decisions. I found myself making choices that weren’t necessarily in my kingdom’s best interest with hopes of discovering a new character or item to spice up the game.
In my experience, however, these encounters come most often from pure luck as opposed to any kind of planning. There’s no guidance given to the player other than three goals for each reign. When your king takes power, any accomplished goals are replaced with new ones. These are often fairly cryptic—“Recruit the doctor,” “Discover a new world,” and so forth. These are snappy titles, to be sure, but they don’t offer a lot in the way of guidance. Often the path to accomplishing them becomes clear only on the exact turn that they can be achieved. This is fun the first few times, but when discovery is the lifeblood of the game and it’s possible to go a few reigns without discovering anything, one starts to wish there was some way to move it along.
I’ll switch gears briefly here to talk briefly about presentation. It’s actually pretty good looking; characters are represented by sharp, easily distinguishable minimalist art. The cards are bright, and the angular geometric art style is quite impressive. The game doesn’t have a lot in the way of eye candy, but what it does have is consistently easy on the eyes. The soundtrack goes much the same way; it’s good but nothing incredible.
Here’s the thing though: “Reigns” is not a game I can really enjoy playing for more than half an hour at a time. That doesn’t mean it’s a bad game; there’s just not enough there to make it worth it. If you’re a completionist, someone for whom getting to 100% discovery is fun in and of itself, maybe you disagree. But for me, there’s not enough variety. There’s only so much yes-and-no-ing I can do before it starts to feel repetitive, even with new flavor text on events that more or less do the same thing as other events.
I played “Reigns” for a total of 40 minutes. I started out really enjoying the journey: It was fun to manage the bars, see which choices led to which outcomes, and try to survive for as long as possible. But that got old after about half an hour. It was still nice to see how long I could survive, what new thing I could see that run. But I was still doing, fundamentally, what I was at minute one. Maybe there’s more to the game than I got to; but if there is, the game clings a bit too much for my tastes to its theme of minimalism—which extends to the tutorial—to offer any reassurance in that regard.

In Vladimir Nabokov’s short story “Signs and Symbols,” a man suffers from “referential mania,” a rare disorder that causes its sufferer to imagine that everything in the universe—idle chatter, birdsong, newspaper articles—refers to him. Events within the story are interwoven with seemingly extraneous references, such as labels on jam jars, blurring the line between the newly created world of the story and the pre-existing world of memory. Nabokov’s writing reveals how utterly meaningless the term “original” is—every work of art relies on the one preceding it, either as inspiration or antithesis. While this creative genealogy is essential, it has often been maligned, as “inspired by” and “based on” are increasingly interpreted as “knock-off.” Nowhere is this more evident that in Hollywood, where the recent surge of remakes has caused critics to lament the death of a medium. As is often the case, however, the implications are much more complicated.
Hollywood is a cultural behemoth, and while its vast capital allows it to create lavish blockbuster hits, it is also difficult for a giant to follow with the delicate two-step that is today’s culture. The #OscarsSoWhite boycott is one such example. While a lack of racial diversity begins long before award shows, with allegedly unfair hiring practices and a dearth of minority writers, the controversy soon centered on the Oscars. It quickly became clear that change does not come quickly to such a large cultural institution. The blockbuster business model, in which studios focus on a handful of big-budget films, necessitates tried and true formulas; if one film fails, the entire studio goes down with it. For this reason, Hollywood tends to rely on the safety and cultural capital of memory, and even when women or minorities are cast in leading roles—a “risky” move—they are cast into films like “Ghostbusters” and “Star Wars,” the fame of which ensures that audiences will flock to see them no matter what.
Disney is a prime example of the remake market, and it has been outspoken about its plans to create a steady stream of remakes until 2019. Is Disney simply out of ideas? Or is there another reason for the lavish barrage of remakes? Once again, the answer lies in the business model: A film has essentially a single shot at success, one that can either end spectacularly or disastrously. Once the verdict is out on social media, there is little chance for the film to redeem itself. Television, on the other hand, is much more flexible; when Donald Trump began his run for president, “Scandal” was quick to create an analogous character, and then take him down, fulfilling the fantasies of their liberal audience. “Game of Thrones,” one of the most successful TV shows of all time, relies on tantalizing its audiences to create buzz. Whereas film is the one-night stand of media, a TV show is a long term-relationship, in which both parties are equally invested. This type of investment is primed to take advantage of social media, in which endless memes, fan theories, and recaps generate cultural momentum for TV shows, often resulting in a snowball effect in which the number of viewers increases between seasons. Films, however, don’t work this way, because someone who has not seen the first film is unlikely to see the sequel.
It is for this reason that Hollywood panders to topical appeal, as opposed to plot appeal. While the trillions of superhero film remakes are a mishmash of sequels, prequels, and reboots, they are never marketed this way; instead, they are treated as a “new version” of events, ones that require no familiarity with the previous film but rather only a familiarity with characters. It is for this reason that Disney’s reboots are so successful: They draw upon a certain nostalgia, as well as a guarantee that their middle-class, value-seeking audiences will get the most of their money. Many film critics lament this fact, alleging that this “pandering to the masses” will cause a decline of the film medium.
This “problem” is nothing new. In the middle of the 19th century, German critics lamented the fact that their avant-garde music was misunderstood by the masses, who allegedly preferred classic formulas to the pioneering work of “true” musicians. These artists failed to grasp the idea that a medium can exist on multiple levels, from the plebeian to the profound; the existence of “common” music does not preclude the existence of “true art.” Furthermore, what is often seen as a destructive influence in one era is hailed as an innovation in another; history is replete with examples of artists who failed to find fame in their own eras, only to become astoundingly well-known after their deaths. While the artists’ work itself remained unchanged, the way in which audiences interpreted this art slowly shifted.
Viewed from this lens, the medium of Hollywood is arguably the purest or the most sordid form of art, depending on how one views audience opinions. Unlike niche-art, which often serves the artist’s sensibilities more than the audience’s, big-box Hollywood cinema is not shielded from the power of its viewers. It is precisely this audience that has allowed the remake industry to continue; if audiences wouldn’t pay to see these films, it would make no sense to continue to make them. And while it might be true that many Hollywood films today are formulaic, one must also consider the fact that recreations and remakes have long been part of the history of film. “Scarface” is one such example—a remake that went on to become a hallowed classic.
While the financial aspects of cinema causes many studios to cement themselves into reliable money-making formulas, this should come as a surprise to no one who refers to the film “industry.” Cultural production is a business like any other, and the remake strategy has been a veritable gold mine. Despite our so-called desire to explore the future, nostalgia and past memories retain a strong pull. It is this appeal that Nabokov understood so strongly: The human mind will always be drawn to untouched, hallowed memories, a safe space amid the rankling controversy of today. Hollywood allows us to relive the past in a new way—while making a hefty profit all the while.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first few weeks of school are always buzzing on campus, and Harvard’s indie folk-inspired quintet the Lighthouse Keepers has contributed to the excitement this fall. Consisting of Abby L. Westover ’17, Ella M. Duncan ’17, Colby S. Knight ’17, Aidan R. Chavez ’18, and Matt Matsudaira ’17, the band published a single, “In a Moment,” on Sept. 3. The group now has an EP album coming out at the end of this school year and has performed at multiple venues on campus, including Yardfest last spring, but they trace their roots back to the humble basement of Matthews Hall, where three of the members met during their first year on campus.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you guys first come together to form the band?
Colby S. Knight: So it was just the three of us—me, Ella, and Abby—in the beginning. Our first gig was Arts First our freshman spring, which was just kind of an outlet for us to create a name for ourselves, because Abby literally needed to fill out a name for us to sign up, and thus we were born. I invested in a cajón which is this drum-box-thing that you play on, but because I play guitar in the band, I just sat on it and kicked it with my foot while playing guitar.
Abby L. Westover: And [he was] singing. Which was super impressive. Super impressive.
CSK: But it became clear pretty quickly that was unsustainable…. I knew Aidan through the Oak Club and knew that he was a drummer. I asked if he wanted to come play music with us one day, and he just fit right away and it totally worked. We asked another friend of ours, Matt Matsudaira, to play bass for us. And then finally, we had a full band sound, and that’s where we are now.
Ella M. Duncan: And just one more thing about the name. The first song I remember playing with Abby and really feeling connected was called “The Lighthouse Tale” by Nickel Creek and [I remember] thinking, “Wow, this is really something we could continue.”
THC: You also have a Christmas album. Why a Christmas album?
ALW: So the Christmas album we recorded on our iPhones, in the span of one evening our sophomore fall, in Colby’s living room. It was the day before I was leaving for home for Christmas, but we just wanted to have a little gift to give our families.
Aidan R. Chavez: That was the second gig I had with the Lighthouse Keepers, and I was like this is weird playing Christmas music, but it was one of the most fun times I’ve ever had. Everyone loves Christmas music, and it was such good energy.
THC: What are some of the greatest challenges and advantages of being in college and your own band at the same time at Harvard?
ALW: Being in some sort of band was something I thought about in high school that would be really cool to do in college but didn’t think was actually going to happen. But once we started to really play on campus last year, people would come to our gigs to see us and learn about us, then they would ask us to play at other events and venues on campus. As opposed to being in the real world, where you have to take a lot more initiative to go find new things, your gigs are really facilitated nicely in a college environment.
EMD: And I think [that with] the culture here being so busy, sometimes it’s hard to go against the grain of doing something purely because it’s fun and it’s not necessarily because it’s toward a direction of a career or a post-grad. It’s just basically because we love it and we like to share it with others. And that’s a really simple concept but to actually internalize it and feel good in the moment doing it is probably more difficult than I would like, but I think a lot of people resonate with that pressure.
ARC: Also, I played a ton of drums in high school, and it was a big part of my life. And freshman year, it fell off the radar at Harvard. Even if music is really important to you, a lot of times you get really busy at Harvard, and it’s hard to put aside your studies and whatever extracurriculars you’re doing, and your whole life essentially, just to go play music. I definitely struggled with that. But it’s super worth it. If you feel like you’re losing touch with something you like to do—especially if it’s music—try to find some friends and make sure it happens…. It’s really important. Also, Colby looks just like Drake Bell.

In a one-night-only performance of Antonín Dvořák’s grand opera “Dimitrij” on Sept. 16, the chaos and despair of tsarist Russia took over the New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall. While director Gil Rose’s decision to stage the three-and-a-half-hour opera for a contemporary audience tested the endurance of even the most seasoned opera enthusiasts, the performance nonetheless tugged at all the right heartstrings and struck just the right tone in what was ultimately an artistically impressive performance of “Dimitrij.”
Based on the true story of the impersonation of the assassinated son of Ivan the Terrible in 1605, “Dimitrij” is a tale of love and power. It begins in the aftermath of the death of Tsar Boris Godunov, with the Russian state desperate and tsarless. Enter Dimitrij (Aleš Briscein)—the self-proclaimed son of Ivan the Terrible—and Marina (Dana Burešová), his ruthless and proud Polish bride. Much of the first act surrounds the uncertainty about Dimitrij’s identity, which is ultimately confirmed by his would-be mother Marfa (Irina Mishura). Once Dimitrij becomes Tsar, tensions begin to emerge in the royal marriage that mirror those between Russians and Poles. Just as the love between Dimitrij and Marina begins to fade, the false tsar saves and charms the beautiful Xenie (Olga Jelínková), daughter of the late Godunov. The rest of the opera follows this love triangle as Dimitrij’s marriage disintegrates and jealousy drives Marina to murder Xenie, leaving Dimitrij to confess his wrongs and face execution accordingly.
To be clear, the four-act grand opera is not for the faint of heart. Conversations between characters extend for 40 to 45 minutes and yet can be summarized in a sentence or two. Suspense builds and builds and is ultimately broken, but there are times when the sheer length of the opera tests the limits of a modern audience’s attention span. The trend among contemporary operas has been to condense their lengthy source materials in order to accommodate the changes in the makeup of their audiences. One is left to wonder whether or not Odyssey Opera would have benefited from such a revision of Dvořák’s libretto, especially considering the fact that curtains rose at 7:30 P.M. Indeed, there were multiple instances throughout the performance in which dialogue verged on the redundant, suggesting that perhaps director Gil Rose would have been well-advised to streamline the interactions for the sake of fluidity.
With that said, the performance was often not only impressive but even stunning. The first overture crescendoed as the brass added a discordant desperation to complement the sadness of the strings. The chorus set the tone of a Russia in virtual ruins before the entrance of the solemn yet charismatic Dimitrij. Briscein’s rendering of the title role was effortless; the native Czech tenor imbued his character with the dignity and strength that makes him so complex. His performance was supplemented by those of the female leads (Burešová and Jelínková), who served as foils to one another—one strong and ambitious and the other melodious and graceful. The actors all took the stage with opera in hand and read from music stands, but the lack of staging was not necessarily amiss, as it allowed the music to deliver the pathos.
The tendency toward minimalism extended even to the actors’ dress. While this aspect of the opera was unremarkable at first blush, since all the performers wore suits and dresses rather than costumes, the color scheme nonetheless related a rather telling narrative. In fact, the only actors who wore anything with visible color were the three leads, and each color choice was clearly carefully made. Dimitrij wore a red tie that symbolized his passion and strength. Marina’s golden shawl characterized her lust for power. Xenie’s blue dress underscored her natural purity: She was the only person on stage who did not wear anything black, a fateful omen of her ultimate death. These wardrobe choices, while small, often served to trace the opera’s emotional arc.

Alexander Brettin seems a little cynical. It’s an attitude at odds with the stoner persona he lovingly cultivates for himself; for evidence of this, look no further than the name of his brainchild, Mild High Club, a pun only a pothead could love. He even goes so far as to describe his latest release, “Skiptracing”; in a tweet, “a private reserve shelf bud of a record... its [sic] dense, crystallized, tasty, laughable, layered, hallucinogenic. Novice beware.”
Leaning into the pothead stereotype, Brettin relies on the word “crystallized” often to explain his aim in creating “Skiptracing.” Speaking to music blog Reverb Party, “With ‘Skiptracing,’ I wanted to push the technology to the limit and make an ultra clean record that sounded crystallized at any volume,” he said. It sets “Skiptracing” apart from Mild High Club’s previous effort, “Timeline.” “I felt like ‘Timeline’ was an experiment in simply making a record,” he said. “Timeline” offered a baroque twist on the work of Ariel Pink and Mac Demarco, both of whom conjure up the faded specter of 70s AM rock so that they may murmur ironically over it.
Brettin’s forebears are more variegated than either Pink’s or Demarco’s, and he’s less bashful about the dorky idolatry that fuels his music. Both of these qualities served him well on “Timeline,” but he fully gives rein to them on “Skiptracing,” preoccupied with seamlessly synthesizing his inspirations: “the full discography of Steely Dan, ‘Breakfast in America’ by Supertramp, ‘Skylarking’ by XTC, ‘Holding You, Loving You’ by Don Blackman, and ‘The Pavilion of Dreams’ by Harold Budd.” Playing “spot-the-influence” with most artists is idle work, but pastiche takes on a remarkable primacy in Mild High Club’s music. “Nothing is truly original anymore… I believe it’s a melting pot of what you’ve acquired,” he said. True or not, it’s a bleak statement, one that makes Brettin come across as rather defeated and prompts the question: What now?
If “Skiptracing” is the answer, not a whole lot. “Skip tracing” is “the process of locating a fugitive that cannot be found at their place of residence or usual hangouts,” and sure enough, the album (allegedly) centers on tracing the development of American music. Given this premise, one might expect “Skiptracing” to be a thrilling odyssey through a plethora of diverse musical periods. It’s not. For an album that purports to be a journey, “Skiptracing” is startlingly inert. Brettin plucks so many disparate styles from their contexts and homogenizes them, draining them of their life and color. The end product is smooth and inoffensive but also painfully dull.
Brettin’s lyrics provide no way out either: In keeping with the plot, they are onanistically all about music itself. “Someone wrote this song before and I could tell you where it’s from,” he lazily croons on “Homage,” before explicitly pointing out the chord progression of the verse. On the title track he sings, “this tonality doesn’t disagree, ought to be chromatically pleasing me,” his vocals rarely rising above a sigh. The title track makes for a promising opening: When the loopy guitar solo drifts in after the cowbell-laden bossa nova chorus, the song approaches the sublime. Yet the rest of the album fails to build on its strong start, choosing instead to grow more diffuse and indistinct. “Whodunit” breaks up the monotony, with frenzied drums that skitter around claustrophobic ambient swells, but its function seems to be to clear out a room—to scare off anyone expecting a reversal in the remaining ten minutes. The next track, “Chasing My Tail,” dawdles to such an extent that one can barely detect a melody, and all that the last substantial track, “Chapel Perilous,” has to show for its existence is a bizarre interpolation of “When You Wish Upon A Star.”
It is tough to tell where Brettin went wrong. Admittedly, his “melting pot” approach did not seem like it would yield anything spectacular, and his focus on presentation rather than content was risky. Whatever the case, “Skiptracing” lacks vibrancy, consistency, and cohesion. It works well as background noise or something to space out to. But taken in one sober, attentive sitting, the tone of “Skiptracing” feels like slowly descending in a busted elevator that can still pump in muzak. The skip it ends up tracing is a point to its proceedings, a reason for it to have been created in the first place, and it comes out empty-handed. The album’s conclusion is telling: “Skiptracing (Reprise)” merely slows down the first few seconds of the title track and superimposes its bass line over street noise. We’re right where we started—probably because we’ve been ambling in place the whole time.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts hosted its first #mfaNOW event, an all-night celebration of contemporary art intended to draw in the city’s younger crowd. Lines to enter the museum snaked around the block, and some patrons waited for over an hour. The party ran from 6 p.m. on Saturday to 9 a.m. the following morning, and the galleries remained full long into the morning. A highlight of the program was Christian Marclay’s 24-hour-long video work “The Clock,” a montage of views of different clocks and watches showing every minute of an entire day that, by the artist’s stipulation, must be viewed in real time: An overnight at the museum is thus the only time most people will ever see the portions of the video running between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m.
Oftentimes, museums are as quiet as churches, but on Saturday music from several DJs pulsed through the MFA’s contemporary art wing. One of the museum’s restaurants became a dance floor, while other spaces transformed into studios where attendees could make their own collages inspired by the museum’s current exhibition of works by artist and writer Frances Stark. Outside on the MFA’s lawns, Linda Apple, director of volunteer and community engagement at the MFA, presided over live performance art and graffiti-making. Later on in the night, tired museum-goers rested outdoors on inflatable cushions in the warm September night. “We wanted to get a younger audience into the museum,” she said. “The Frances Stark collage exhibition is really geared toward that [demographic]….It’s very cool, and I think it has a very interesting vibe that will appeal to a younger audience.” Amid the bustle of the crowd and synth-driven bass music, there was little sign of what Apple called the museum’s core audience: visitors 40 and older who belong the MFA’s membership program.
Many of the younger visitors at the all-night party, however, said that they also visit the museum on calmer days. Monica Ricci, a senior at University of Massachusetts Boston studying criminal justice, and Amanda Veriano, a junior at Bunker Hill Community College studying nursing, both spend time at the museum throughout the year. “I’m a regular,” Veriano says. “I usually come to the museum two or three times a semester depending on the exhibits they have, but I didn’t think there would be so many people here today. It’s not normally this”—Veriano searches for an adjective—“popping.” Ricci said that she enjoyed Saturday night’s programming. “I feel like more museums should have events like this, because it’s a great way to attract people,” she said.

Inman Square is just a brief walk down Cambridge Street from Harvard Square—but in that short span, a quieter atmosphere replaces the manic rush of students and tourists who usually crowd campus. And the Lilypad, a tiny performance space and art gallery at the heart of Inman, is a far cry from the frenzy of university life. The venue hosts writers, musicians, and artists and, according to its website, brings audiences “The Most Original Live Music in the World. Every night.”  The Lilypad, which is indeed open daily, offers performances ranging from live music and poetry readings to film screenings and yoga classes. “The concept for the Lilypad originated in a dream that we have been trying to realize for the past ten years,” said Daniel Sarver, manager of the Lilypad. He also acknowledged the ambitious nature of the performance space’s artistic mission: “Through our existence we hope to show people that yes, this can be done.”
All of the Lilypad’s diverse events take place in a small one-room storefront off Cambridge Street, whose walls are currently covered by oceanic murals by local artist Dan Mayzee. A smattering of benches and chairs take up most of the floor space. In the front of the room, a rounded alcove holds performers, creating an acoustic space reminiscent of a radio studio. The room is sparsely furnished, but the small cash bar is well-stocked with craft beers, hard ciders, and inexpensive wines.
The Lilypad provides the community with space for unusual forms of creative expression. On a recent Wednesday, for instance, the Lilypad hosted “Keyword,” a new monthly show asking writers, musicians, and artists to contemplate a word. September’s prompt word was “ink,” and local hosts Maura Johnston and Nick Cortezi invited three writers and one musician to respond to the theme. “It’s a topic that has a lot of different connotations, like the classic psychological idea of the ink blot,” Johnston said. “You can talk about print, you can talk about tattoos, you can talk about writing, you can talk about just looking at a blot that is on your page and trying to figure out what you see in it, and I wanted these four artists to be invited here tonight to do exactly that.”
Audience member Patrick Burke, a Cambridge resident, was quite taken with the prompt: “I actually really liked the idea. It’s some of the most creative stuff you can do, so it’s cool to see where people take it. Midway through a lot of these pieces, I’m starting to think, ‘How would I have taken the prompt?’” An occasional visitor to the Lilypad, he mentioned that the venue has changed significantly since his first visit two years ago, when the space was set up as a mosh. Sarver also mentioned the Lilypad’s lack of a fixed identity. “The Lilypad is always changing,” Sarver said. “My goal is that every time someone comes in, the Lilypad will be a little different, a little better, but still feel like home.”
The interpretative performances during Ink were emblematic of the Lilypad’s taste for wide-ranging creative expression. The venue’s typical musical offerings are heavy on jazz, but not explicitly tied to any particular genre. Daily live music can come in the form of a band’s album release, a Sunday jazz jam, or a solo folk rock performance. “Our programming is based on presenting music or art to the community that we think is important, relevant, and interesting regardless of genre and style,” Sarver said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The early 2000s saw Scottish pop-rock artist KT Tunstall’s debut album, “Eye to the Telescope,” go platinum on both sides of the pond. Twelve years on, she’s back with a renewed sense of self. Before gracing the stage of Boston’s Royale nightclub, KT sat down with us to talk about her recently-released album “KIN,” finding personal fulfilment, and her long-lasting friendship with former Spice Girl Mel C.
The Harvard Crimson: How does it feel to be touring again?
KT Tunstall: It feels amazing. I loved the last record, but it was very down-tempo. I was touring these beautiful sit-down theatres solo. I was wearing a suit—it was a very classy affair—but ultimately I got completely burnt out; even if an audience are really enjoying themselves it’s very difficult to be reciprocal with the energy when they’re sitting. So it was so amazing going out this May to start doing the summer festivals with “KIN.” We were playing little sweatboxes for 250 to 300 people: You could have wrung my jeans out when I came off stage because I was absolutely drenched, but at the same time completely energized and fired up. I felt so full of fulfilment and joy, which was a completely different feeling after playing the theatre show where I didn’t sweat or jump around as much. People say to me after these recent gigs, “How do you do it? How do you have the energy?” Personally, I feel more energized when I come off than before I’ve gone on. I’ve been through a lot of self-reflection over the past few years, and I’ve come to think the meaning of life is joy. That’s what you should be looking for in your life. Seeing how the fans are responding so strongly to content and the subject matter of these songs has just been extraordinary.
THC: This new record is a departure from the past three releases.
KTT: For sure. It’s up there with the first record in terms of being a very upbeat pop-rock, big chorus album. In some ways it does feel like I’ve taken three records to write my second album. It’s a really great feeling of going full circle, coming around back to making music because I love it, without the pressure of a record label or what the fans want or what will get played on the radio. There is definitely a relationship with that first album, but at the same time I’ve come around to “KIN” as a very different person. There’s a total mojo renewal that I didn’t have before. So in my mind, it’s a much better place to be making music from.
THC: Was it a conscious decision to come back to the first album’s vibe?
KTT: No, not at all. I was planning to take a five-to 10-year hiatus from making records: I was burnt out, I didn’t really want to do it, I wasn’t attracted to making other records or writing or touring. My dad had passed away, my marriage had broken up, and life was totally upside-down in London, so I sold everything I owned and moved to California. I was expecting to take a long time out from my solo career, but after about a year of driving around listening to the likes of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, I started writing these really big pop-rock choruses. At first I was resistant, but really you’ve just got to respect the fact that your inspiration has come. The material was so strong that I would have been really foolish not to follow up.
THC: And you’re living full time in the LA area now?
KTT: I’m an official resident of Venice Beach! I lived the first half of my life in Britain having to wear thermal underwear in the middle of May and never leaving the house without a cardigan, and now, finally, I’ve been rewarded in the second half of my life where I can go and eat my breakfast outside every morning surrounded by palm trees. I love it.
THC: Does your Scottish heritage still influence you?
KTT: There’s something so precious about knowing somewhere. It’s like having a really old friend who knows you: It’s a very easy relationship. I love knowing the bends in the road, the trees and the landmarks. A lot of it is about the Scottish landscape for me. It’s very special.
THC: The new album was released on Sept. 9. What’s the story behind the name “KIN”?
KTT: The whole album is about coming through a lot of difficult challenges and actually being in a better place at the end of it—using music to become wiser, more compassionate. You learn through that process who the people you really want in your life are, and I realized that the people I really love and who really love me are kin.
THC: I watched the video for “Hard Girls” earlier today. How did you get Mel C involved in the project?
KTT: Oh man. It was one of the most fun videos I’ve ever filmed. Mel and I met at my agent’s birthday party about 10 years ago while we were on the dance floor busting some moves. She’s an extraordinary person—I don’t know how she’s kept her head through the absolute insanity of being a Spice Girl and the unbelievable success they had. She’s just a lovely person and such a good laugh, so she was such an obvious choice when it came to casting for the video. I was so pleased that she was up for doing it.
THC: Speaking of collaborations, you have a track with [English singer-songwriter] James Bay on the new record. How did that come about?
KTT: It was such a stroke of luck! We met at a New Year’s Eve gig and he was so sweet—he was telling me that he’d been to a bunch of my shows before he was famous. It’s just crazy to think that there was an unknown James Bay watching my gigs!
THC: And finally, you’ve played here in Boston before—does anything about the city stand out?
KTT: Oh, totally—one of my favorite memories of Boston is walking down the street, looking up, and seeing a hawk flying right down the middle of the street. It then picked up a pigeon and took it right up to the top of a building. It turned out it was a vermin control program in which they were bringing big birds of prey into the city to eat all of the pigeons. It was one of the most awesome things I’ve ever seen—I thought I was in Jurassic Park.
KT Tunstall’s new album, “KIN,” is out now.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s a plot that could easily have been ripped from the headlines: a young gay couple attacked on the street while kissing. Telling a story typical of the kind of violence the BGLTQ community faces daily, the premiere of Diana Son’s “Stop Kiss” nevertheless surprised New York audiences in 1998. Now, from Sept. 22 to 24, the production comes to Harvard’s Loeb Experimental Theatre, where director Casey J. Durant ’18 aims to put on a production that goes beyond violence and politics to deliver a deeply human love story.
“Stop Kiss” is the unfolding story of the relationship between Callie, a traffic reporter, and Sara, a schoolteacher, two young women living and working in New York City. The two are walking through the West Village one night, when they share their first kiss; suddenly, a bystander attacks them viciously, leaving Callie badly injured and Sara in a coma. The play is nonlinear, slipping between the aftermath of the attack and the relationship preceding it from scene to scene.
For Durant’s first attempt at directing, she purposefully chose a play that speaks to the struggles of a group that is often underrepresented in our culture. “Something that was really important to me going into this process was to highlight stories that don’t always get told in theatre,” Durant says.
She says it was equally important to find a script that was not only a political statement, but that also told an engaging and intellectually stimulating story. “It was really important to me that the two women in this play are really complex, fully-fledged characters, as well as showing this beautiful and healthy lesbian relationship on stage.”
Actress Peryn E. A. Reeves-Darby ’18, who plays Callie, agrees. “Any story which is not considered the ‘norm,’ which is not what you see on ABC Family—it’s good to see that,” she says. She feels that the production holds something valuable for everyone, even if one disagrees with the principles underlying the production. “The show will really make people think,” she says. Even if you don’t necessarily agree with everything we’re saying, it’s such a good show, it could open your mind to new things.”

I wouldn’t be at Harvard without generous assistance from women at every stage of my life.
Take my mother, who set aside her professional career to homeschool me and my three siblings—an extraordinary gift I’ll never be able to fully repay. Then there’s the female scientist who invited me to work in her lab—where I was mentored by a female grad student, whose letter of recommendation was a highlight of my college application.
Female teachers, professors, and advisors of all kinds gave me invaluable guidance and assistance throughout my life, and continue to do so in my classes and research at Harvard.
So when a hand-written invitation to a reception hosted by the all-male Porcellian Club slipped under my door, I knew I couldn’t accept it. Of course, I was honored that such an august group had even noticed me. And I admit I’m tickled by the idea of being in a club that boasts alumni like Charles Sumner, Robert Gould Shaw, Teddy Roosevelt, and the Winklevoss twins.
My curiosity was piqued, too; I’d love to get a glimpse of how the famously secretive organization operates, and thank the mysterious acquaintance who got my name past the punch selection cabal. (I heard this would be an open punch, but I was the only one in my suite of five male sophomores to get a letter.) However, it would be wrong to accept the hospitality of a club I do not intend to join, and I owe too much to too many women to acquiesce to the Porcellian’s staunchly defended single-gender policy.
To become a member of a club committed to a form of social bonding in which women are unable to participate would feel like a repudiation of my female mentors’ kindness. Indeed, it would be a poor way to express my debt of gratitude to the women who helped me get into Harvard in the first place. And as a man in a society where simply putting a female name at the top of an academic job application makes it less attractive, it seems wrong for me to use women’s generosity as a springboard to get into this oldest of old-boy networks.
More selfishly, I don’t want to limit my friend group unnecessarily. Setting aside high-minded considerations of personal obligation, let alone appeals to abstract concepts of justice and equality, I’m disinclined to commit so much time to a social group drawn from only half of the College’s amazing student body.
Some of the most fascinating and impressive people I’ve met at Harvard have been women. One female friend’s international work in drug policy taught her how to win allies among ambassadors and drug dealers with equal assurance; another immigrated to the U.S. in eighth grade, speaking no English, and within a few years was doing biochemical research; another launched into advanced math classes, earning top grades while gaining a reputation for being friendly and entertaining.
Finding and connecting with people like these is all I wanted from social life at Harvard, and getting to know these friends has been the among the best of my experiences here. I wouldn’t forgo the opportunity to spend more time with them—and other women like them—even if the myths about the financial prospects of PC alumni were true.
Growing up homeschooled, my siblings and I spent most of our childhoods playing games together; our mother, as a part-time referee, always taught us to value fairness and inclusivity. I am encouraged by the recent changes to final club membership policies that move closer to these ideals, and I would be honored to participate in the punch process as soon as it becomes possible for my non-male friends to do so as well.
As Groucho Marx didn’t almost say, I wouldn’t belong to any club that would have me as a member—unless it would also admit the scintillating, accomplished, and generous women I’ve been fortunate enough to know.

Taking heed of employee feedback and the recommendations of an outside review, Dorm Crew has introduced significant and positive changes for its employees. This year marks the first in which the pre-orientation program provided dinners, and this fall will see a significant increase in wages in hopes of retaining more employees. While these changes represent progress towards increasing the value of student work opportunities on campus, much more can be done to better equalize the playing field of term-time employment opportunities for students.
In recent years, the College has turned a critical eye to its own issues of diversity, assembling a working group that ultimately published an extensive report highlighting imbalances in student life, academic offerings, and faculty representation. This report indicated that, despite Harvard’s efforts to create a diverse student body in which all feel they are full members of the community, the University is still not immune to the many structural inequities that permeate the our society.
These structural inequities manifest themselves throughout campus, but one significant way in which they clearly influence student life is in the different work expectations faced by students from different socioeconomic backgrounds one they arrive in Cambridge. Many students from lower income backgrounds are already keenly aware of the sacrifices they have to make in order to make ends meet, sometimes at the expense of academic work and extracurricular involvement. These grievances highlight the struggles that some undergraduates with term-time jobs face. We believe that the diversity and inclusion working group’s recommendations for action should serve as an impetus for positive change in this area, and we are glad that these suggestions are starting to take root.
In the case of Dorm Crew, an increased wage means student workers will be able to work fewer hours, freeing up precious time for going to office hours and club meetings, or simply studying. This will likely increase interest in Dorm Crew, as well as  the program's rate of retention. Other student work opportunities, however, do not offer comparable wages. Though the pay increase may seem like an unalloyed good, it is important to consider that these changes may have a coercive effect on lower-income students’ approach to potential employment.  They may be pigeonholed for the sake of money into cleaning toilets, a job that can erect an uncomfortable power dynamic between them and their peers who may be pursuing other avenues of employment. Ultimately, equitable pay across student work opportunities is crucial for maximizing choice and minimizing any deleterious effects of term-time employment opportunities.
In the same vein, we believe that Harvard should look more broadly into financial aid to evaluate whether existing supplemental programs are adequate. After freshman year, startup grants and coat funds are no longer offered, which may push students towards taking on jobs that hinder them from making the most of their college experience in later years.

Our hearts were full of gratitude towards American women of color this summer.
I saw, for the first time in my life, a television screen filled with so many women of color like myself. The shades of their skin—so similar to my own and that of my community—took center stage as a symbol of the best that our country has to offer.
And I—an older brother—watching the Olympics with my two sisters, two young Latina women who spend hours in the pool and on the soccer field, I felt pure joy at the American exceptionalism on screen. 
Simone Biles controlled the gymnastics stadium, winning multiple gold medals and proving her unparalleled talent. Simone Manuel became the first African American woman to win a medal in a swimming event, and the prize was a glimmering gold that represented victory over an ugly, hateful past. Michelle Carter embraced her femininity towards the United States’ first medal in shot put.
And finally, Laurie Hernandez won the silver medal on the individual beam just days after helping the American team take gold in the women’s all around in gymnastics. The Puerto Rican girl from Jersey put it all out there to become second in the world, at just 16-years-old. By any standards, Hernandez is a shining example of excellence.
On the international stage, she represented American excellence. To us, and quite possibly all the brown people watching from East LA to the Bronx, Laurie Hernandez represented Latinx excellence. In an election season where hatred against our melanin and our resilience as immigrants runs rampant, Hernandez glows and her silver shines, reflecting the best our country has to offer.
While her exceptionalism can move and inspire young, God-loving brown girls all over the country, it’s also a rogue attempt at survival. If Hernandez were to fail, Americans would be disproportionately unkind. Her skills would be called into question; her athleticism and past performances irrelevant. People of color, especially black and Latinx people, are held to a higher standard in the very country that they’ve uplifted in these Olympics. It’s as if white mediocracy is valid, and brown and black mediocracy is not.
Gabby Douglas, the star of the London Olympics, was met with criticism this year when she unintentionally failed to put her hand over her heart during the national anthem. Her patriotism was under fire at the same time that her hair was. Something so tied to her anatomy—her blackness—was criticized. This double standard undermines her success. In this case, even her excellence could not save her.
Upon joining university communities, Latinx individuals are questioned from the outset about their worth. The assumption is that brownness is our key here, and our supposedly lacking intellect is the loose baggage we bring along with photographs from home. We are held to a higher standard than our white peers. There is no way of mincing those words. No one assumes that I am a legacy admit. I am an affirmative action admit.
Our intellect is never central. Our skin is.
To make up for this, we have to be twice as good. There is a pressure to reach academic excellence at elite institutions right after leaving high schools that were under resourced. The disconnect is not addressed—with institutions like Harvard lacking bridge programs—so Latinx students are stuck between unequal levels of expectation and preparation to reach them. Even though we’re often ill-equipped, we have to maintain perfect grades to prove our validity on campus.
While this stress overloads our brain, we also don’t get the mental health attention we need. We’re not allowed to give up, or ask for help, because we’ll come to represent our communities negatively. Latinx students have to be excellent, because we are few and far between and represent communities whose majorities are barred from these institutions. If we’re the first in our family to go to college, we’re beacons of a disappearing American Dream. There’s no room to be weak. There’s no room to be mediocre.
But that’s something we can change.
We should work to reach a point where my excellence is not a requirement, and when my failure will not be seen as a failure on the part of all Latinx students. In my future, I am allowed to be mediocre. I am allowed to fail. I am allowed to be human. I cannot wait for the day I am allowed to feel human.

Harvard English professor and Pulitzer-winning writer Louis Menand will receive the National Humanities Medal for his writings on cultural history from President Barack Obama at the White House Thursday.
President Obama announced the 12 winners of the 2015 National Humanities Award last Tuesday in conjunction with the National Endowment for the Humanities.
The NEH citation said Menand will be recognized for “prose and essays that invite us to think in new ways about the forces shaping our society.” The NEH annually solicits nominations from individuals and organizations that are then reviewed by the National Council on the Humanities and ultimately selected by President Obama. 
Menand said he did not expect to receive the medal.
“The chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities called me, and I asked if he had the wrong person,” Menand said. “I write magazine pieces, so it just felt like somebody had been paying attention to what I’ve been trying to do for a long time.”
Menand teaches 19th and 20th century cultural history and is one of the co-creators and professors of the popular course, Humanities 10: “A Humanities Colloquium.” He is the author of several books, including “The Marketplace of Ideas” and “The Metaphysical Club,” which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2002.
Menand has been a contributor to The New Yorker since 1991 and a staff writer for the magazine since 2001. David Remnick, editor-in-chief of The New Yorker, lauded Menand for his work on American intellectual and literary history as well as for his writing style.
“He’s one of the slyest and funniest writers we’ve got at The New Yorker—he has an inimitably and deceptively simple style,” Remnick said. “Whoever makes these choices about the medals had a burst of insight and taste.”
Colleagues of Menand praised the NEH’s choice and spoke highly of his talent as both a historian and a writer. English Department Chair James W. Simpson wrote in an email that Menand “operates at the highest levels across an astonishing range of scholarly and journalistic domains.”
English professor Stephen J. Greenblatt pointed to Menand’s versatility as one of his best writerly attributes.
“He is an intellectual, a very significant intellectual and historian, but he’s also a writer. Those don’t always go together, but in his case they do, and that’s a powerful combination,” he said.
Jonathan W. Galassi ’71, Menand’s publisher and the president of New York-based publishing house Farrar Straus and Giroux, wrote in an email that Menand is “one of today’s more original and incisive cultural critics constantly making us rethink our commonplaces and received opinions.”
Menand joins the ranks of several other Harvard professors who have received the award, including history professor Evelyn B. Higginbotham and Divinity School professor Diana L. Eck.
Menand is currently working on a book focusing on post-war America, which he said he hopes to finish within the next year.

For the first time, students in the College’s introductory economics class must purchase a $132 access code to an online textbook and set of online materials—a course requirement that many have criticized as making the class too expensive. But the course’s professor and the textbook’s author, N. Gregory Mankiw, said the new system is worth the pricetag. 
Unlike in previous years, students in Economics 10: “Principles of Economics,” the foundational course for the Economics Department, cannot purchase used textbooks, which often offer a cheaper alternative to the new books. Instead, they must purchase access to the MindTap learning system, an online platform developed by the textbooks’ publisher that includes test preparation materials, problem-sets, and quizzes for the course. An online copy of the textbook is included on MindTap’s website, and students also receive a loose-leaf hard copy.
The access will expire after 12 months, so students can not resell their textbooks, Mankiw said.
As of Monday evening, 647 undergraduates were enrolled in Ec 10, the College’s largest class this semester. In 2014, 618 students concentrated in economics, according to the College’s handbook for students.
Mankiw said he was able to negotiate with the publisher to obtain a lower price for Harvard students, who were the first university students to use the new system in their classroom. Mankiw said he waited to implement the program until other colleges had tested it.
But some students and the Crimson’s editorial board have argued that the mandatory price is too expensive for an introductory course that is a prerequisite for the economics concentration, as well as other social science concentrations.
“For those students who aren’t privileged enough to buy new textbooks, this is really expensive and burdensome,” Irene Limb ’18, a student in the course, said.
Mankiw, however, said the combination of textbook and supplementary materials MindTab offers makes the price reasonable.
“We were very careful to get what we considered was a good price,” he said. “We wouldn’t have done it just for the textbook. The issue was this whole online learning system.”
Limb also questioned the necessity of using MindTap instead of a free website, such as Canvas, the online learning platform that the College’s courses use. According to Anne Le Brun, the head section leader for Ec 10, MindTap offers features such as step-by-step problem solving, a graph builder, customized test preparation quizzes, and an app.
Mankiw said that MindTap also allows for automatic grading on some assignments, which frees up section leaders to spend more time on other parts of the course.
Though current students may benefit from MindTap’s materials, former students who planned on re-selling their textbooks, like Luke Driscoll ’17-’18, now find their market monopolized by the Coop.
Driscoll said he assumed he would be able to resell his textbook when he purchased it, used, last year. He added that the increase in price would have been a factor in his decision to take the class, because it is not a requirement for his concentration.
Mankiw said he is always looking for ways to improve the course, and he said the switch to MindTap may not be permanent. He said he is looking forward to receiving student feedback after students have used the system for a year.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard graduate students organizing for a union have enthusiastically greeted a recent National Labor Relations Board ruling allowing student teachers and research assistants at private universities.
But some of Harvard’s undergraduate teaching assistants have hardly considered unionizing, let alone considered the implications of the ruling, which could affect them.
Several undergraduates working as teaching fellows and course assistants had not heard about the recent ruling that deemed them employees with collective bargaining rights. Most interviewed said they were either ambivalent or opposed to potentially joining a union.
Anna Cowenhoven, a Faculty of Arts and Sciences spokesperson, declined to comment on the potential for undergraduate students to unionize.  The spokesperson of the Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Auto Workers, Jack M. Nicoludis, also declined to comment.
Following the NLRB’s August ruling, graduate student unionization campaigns have swept campuses across the country, and the discussion surrounding the decision has focused mostly on graduate students. But the NLRB decision itself does not differentiate between graduate and undergraduate students; undergraduate teaching fellows and course assistants are not excluded from the Board’s new expanded categorization of employees.
When a union petitions the NLRB to represent a bargaining unit, it must make clear in its petition the workers it intends to include. If the employer—in this case Harvard—considers the included workers compromise too broad a group, it may argue for a more restricted unit. If the petitioning union and the employer do not come to an agreement, the NLRB makes the final decision on who is included.
Former NLRB chairman and labor law expert William B. Gould wrote in an email that, should there be a dispute between the HGSU-UAW and Harvard over the type of employees included in the unit, the NLRB would base its assessment on “how similar their wages, benefits, [and] conditions of employment are.”
At Harvard, undergraduate and graduate student teaching fellows perform many of the same duties, including holding office hours and leading sections.
But a number of undergraduate TFs said they do not feel a need to unionize and characterized their work as closer to an extracurricular activity than a job. Some had not even realized they could be included in a collective bargaining unit, or had even heard of the new ruling at all.
Daniel H. Nightingale ’18, a teaching fellow for Economics 1010a: “Intermediate Microeconomics,” said his paycheck from TFing is not primarily why he signed up for the position. As an economics concentrator, he said he took on the job as a learning experience because he would get to review the material.
“I see it more as an extracurricular I guess,” Nightingale said. “I think for me it’s just another way to learn, and the fact that I get paid while doing it is just an added bonus.”
Unlike for many undergraduates, though, the TF job is often a major part of the graduate student experience. Graduate students in some departments typically have a specific number of years they are expected to teach, though some graduate students pick up extra sections for more pay, because they rely on their teaching as a source of income.
Tony Turner ’19, who is TFing Engineering Sciences 51: “Computer-Aided Machine Design” for his second semester, said that while graduate students are unionizing on issues related to housing and the stability of their teaching workload, he think undergrads do not have a reason to unionize because they have more options for campus employment and their TF positions are relatively short.
“Maybe the demands of TFing as an undergrad for certain courses here just aren’t enough,” Ivraj Seerha ’19, a teaching fellow for ES51 said. “For me personally I feel no great pressure is upon me where I would need an outside organization in order to help mediate between me and Harvard, or me and my professor.”
A majority of graduate student workers have signed an authorization card in support of the HGSU-UAW.
A  number of undergraduates declined to comment for because they said they were uninformed on the issue.
“I can’t really be certain,” Seerha said, when asked how he would vote if given the chance in a union election. “To be quite frank, I don’t think I’m informed enough about the benefits or the disadvantages of having a union.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New residents of Cambridge, including incoming Harvard students, will receive information on local bicycle regulations, the Cambridge City Council ordered at its weekly Monday night meeting.
A trio of resolutions, all focused on increasing knowledge about bike laws in Cambridge, passed unanimously. The resolutions, sponsored by Mayor E. Denise Simmons, requested that the City Manager’s office work with the city and local colleges to provide new residents and students with relevant bicycle safety information. 
“There’s a good deal of volume of bicycles in the area, and people may be coming from areas where there aren’t as many,” said Sandra Clarke, Cambridge’s deputy director of community development. “[The resolutions are] intended to reach out to folks who may be new to the community.”
Bike safety has been at the center of many City Council discussions after June 23, when Amanda N. Phillips ’10, formerly of Lowell House and student at MGH Institute of Health Professions, died in a bike accident in Inman Square.
Following the accident this summer, the Council passed a resolution ordering the City Manager’s Office and the Cambridge office of community development “to fast-track plans to completely redesign and reconstruct Inman Square’s dangerous 5-street intersection, prioritizing the safety of people who bike and walk.”
Local bikers and residents of Inman Square flooded the June City Council meeting by the dozens, expressing dissatisfaction with Cambridge’s current biking conditions during the public comment period.
According to Clarke, the departments of Community Development and Parking, Traffic and Transportation are jointly considering the Inman Square proposal. However, she also pointed out that Cambridge is considered one of the most bike-friendly cities in America.
“Certainly safety is important to the City of Cambridge and there are some measurements of that in terms of rank,” she said, referring to bicycling.com’s recent ranking of Cambridge as eighth in the nation for best bike cities.
While the bike safety votes were unanimous, Councillor Craig A. Kelley expressed concern over the Council’s current discussions about bike safety and the its ability to target everyone who uses the roads.
“There are a lot of people in the world who aren’t cyclists who don’t even come close to following the rules of the road. Pedestrians, drivers, dog-walkers, you name someone and a big chunk of them are doing whatever seems convenient to them at the same time,” Kelley said. “I think these three orders indicate just how broken our transportation discussion is.”
Charles T. James ’09, founder of Crimson Bikes, a local bike-sharing startup, said he supported the Council's decision.
“I think this is a great idea that will depend on execution to make sure it's effective,” James said in an email. “We'll see how it plays out.”
The move to restructure Inman Square’s intersection follows similar efforts to make the busy streets of Cambridge, Massachusetts’s fifth most populous city, even more pedestrian and biker-friendly. At last week’s meeting, the City Council ordered the City Manager to begin the process of lowering Cambridge’s speed limits. At Monday’s meeting, City Manager Richard C. Rossi reported that the conversion to lower speed limits would begin on Nov. 7, when new state laws go into effect.
While the Council had requested many roads lower their speed limits to 20 or 25 miles per hour, Rossi and Cambridge Director of Parking, Traffic and Transportation Joseph E. Barr reminded the Council about the importance of enforcing the new law.
“I think we want to be careful of sort of putting up a sign and people thinking ‘oh problem solved,’ when in fact it doesn’t really solve as much as we would think,” Barr said.

Two longtime task force members offered their resignations and Allston residents heard the first details about the new Trader Joe’s slated to open on Western Ave. next year in an action-packed meeting of the Harvard-Allston Task Force on Monday night.
“I knew we’d have an exciting meeting,” John A. Bruno, the interim chair of the task force, said of the evening. “I didn’t know it would be this exciting.”
Bruno opened the session by deeming attendees’ “involvement and engagement” his personal inspiration before introducing Joel Sklar, the president of Boston-based real estate developer Samuels & Associates. Harvard chose Samuels & Associates in 2012 to develop its property on the corner of North Harvard Street and Western Ave.
Sklar announced that Continuum—the residential and retail complex Samuels & Associates built on the property—will lease a 13,000-square-foot portion of its ground floor to the grocery chain Trader Joe’s next year, a deal reported by the Boston Globe on Friday.
Bruce E. Houghton, a task force member and the president of Allston-based industrial company Houghton Chemical, had some news of his own.
“I’m doing something different than I’ve done before,” Houghton said. “I am offering you my resignation to this task force... really, I’m offering it to the community.”
Houghton, who was originally appointed to the task force by former Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino to represent the business community, said concerns over transparency compelled him to resign. A section of railyard owned by his company, he explained, lies directly in the path of the $260 million Turnpike realignment project, which proposes to straighten Interstate 90 over the Harvard-owned Beacon Park Railyard.
Houghton, who also sits on the Turnpike project task force run by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, said the conflict has been “tearing him apart” over the past year.
“I was sitting through your meetings and Turnpike meetings and realizing that I couldn’t serve you and Harvard and the taxpayers and the Turnpike all at the same time,” he said to the audience.
He approached Harvard to help resolve the conflict, and the two reached an agreement. Houghton Chemical will relinquish all rights to the railyard property in two years, and Harvard will provide Houghton with “a certain amount of financing” to relocate the rail house, most likely to Scranton, Pa., he said.
Turning to face Harvard spokesperson Kevin Casey, Houghton thanked the University, touting the compromise as what he called the first time that “Harvard used its strength as an institution to help out a small business.”
Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications, said to laughter that the result was “unique in the community [because] Bruce and I are actually on the same page.”
Houghton said he was offering to resign, subject to the neighborhood’s decision, because he wanted Allstonians to decide for themselves whether or not his independence as a task force member has been compromised by the deal with Harvard.
“If you choose that I shouldn’t continue I totally understand it,” he said. “I will gracefully dance away to... I would say the sunset. I guess Scranton is in the West, isn’t it?”
Later, task force member Jim Montgomery also said he was resigning, though his decision is irreversible. Montgomery and his family are moving out the neighborhood, he said, and he will no longer be able to represent the “Allston community.”
Near the end of the session, Bruno announced that the task force will accept applicants to fill the spots of those members unable to “commit themselves to making the meetings.” Of 11 active task force members, only six were present at Monday’s meeting.
Bruno wrapped up the evening by reminding attendees that the next task force meeting will be held in two weeks. “We had a great time, great pizza,” he said. “[Now] have a great night.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four graduate schools joined the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Harvard Divinity School on my.harvard, the University’s online student information system, this fall.
Students can now browse courses at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, the Graduate School of Education, the School of Public Health, and the Kennedy School of Government. They can view their grades, registration information, and financial services in a centralized, online location.
The addition of these graduate schools constitutes the second of two waves to implement the new my.harvard web portal, the first of which consisted of the portal’s official launch last fall, FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke wrote in an email to The Crimson.
In spite of these changes, however, some College students have faced challenges in navigating the updated system. Lethu A. Ntshinga ’18 said that although the expanded course catalog allowed her to view more course opportunities, she was unsure which ones were available to her as an undergraduate.
“I found a lot of courses that I wanted to take, mostly at the School of Public Health, but when I was searching for them, the system showed all courses that were being taught instead of just ones available to undergraduates,” Ntshinga said.
“So all the courses that I wanted to take had prerequisites that disqualified undergraduates,” she added.
According to Burke, Student Financial Services upgraded its billing and payment functions on the my.harvard portal this year as well.
Students can now pay their tuition and file information for direct deposits on the platform itself.
Fiona Young ’18, who used the portal to register financial information with her parents this summer, found the process much more streamlined.
“I think it definitely centralizes things,” Young said. “Before my.harvard was renovated, a lot of administrative tasks for students were separated, but now having access to all of these things in one uniform portal makes it more convenient for students.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A group of Russia experts, including former U.S. and Russian government officials, advocated renewed dialogue in areas of mutual interest as a critical strategy for the next American President during a panel on U.S.-Russia relations at the Institute of Politics Monday night.
The discussion, entitled “Challenges for the Next President: The Crisis with Russia,” was moderated by Jill Dougherty, a global fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and former CNN Moscow bureau chief. Former U.S. ambassador to Russia John Beyrle and visiting lecturer in economics Maxim Boycko, who was Deputy Prime Minister of Russia under former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, led the conversation.
Citing his concern that the U.S.’s aggressive response to Russian actions in Crimea may have jeopardized valuable diplomatic connections between the two countries, Beyrle suggested that the next administration should pursue dialogue on agreeable topics.
Boycko also highlighted the importance of high-level discussions between the U.S. and Russian governments, emphasizing that “the key decisions are made by Mr. Putin himself.”
The panelists lamented the reduction in government funding for Russian studies and language programs, arguing that this trend has been detrimental to U.S.-Russia relations.
Alexander Droznin-Izrael, a doctoral student studying Slavic Languages and Literatures, echoed these concerns, but said he was disappointed that the panel was unable to offer concrete solutions to limited government support.
“What I would have liked to see more of is an actual response, in terms of what we can do going forward,” Droznin-Izrael added.
Boycko also discussed Russia’s domestic political environment. Boycko said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s domestic priorities drive current Russian foreign policy, contending that the intervention in Crimea—despite international condemnation and economic sanctions—boosted Putin’s popularity at home. Boycko added that the Russian populace perceives a lack of “respect” from the U.S. and its Western allies.
Turning towards the U.S. presidential election, Dougherty said that “regardless of who is in power, this will be a changed relationship: very dynamic and very turbulent.”
Beyrle acknowledged the possibility that a new president could have a large impact on relations, citing the “reset” of U.S.-Russia relations during the beginning of President Barack Obama’s administration.
Beyrle also noted that, given a Russian perception of presidential candidate Donald Trump’s volatility, the Russian government “would much prefer to deal with the known qualities of Clinton,” despite Trump’s skepticism of NATO and his compliments directed at Putin.
Despite Russian interests in the outcome of the election, Beyrle said hedid not believe that Russia is trying to actively intervene in U.S. political processes, but instead undermine its credibility.
When asked about Russia’s attempts to influence the Presidential election through state-sponsored media, Dougherty said, “Russia, unfortunately, does not have a soft power message, and… what they do is undermine people who do have some kind of message.”

In its first pair of road clashes, the Harvard men’s soccer team traveled to the Bay Area to face off against perennial powerhouses No. 25 Stanford and California, returning home with a pair of defeats at the hands of the Pac-12 schools.
After opening with a 3-1 loss to the defending national champion Cardinal (3-1-3) on Friday, the Crimson (2-3-1) was unable to respond against the Golden Bears (3-2-1), falling to a 6-2 loss. Though the results were not the ones the team was looking for, the experience gained from this weekend could prove to be a pivotal turning point going into Ivy play.
“I think two months from now...we’re going to look back at this week pretty fondly,” senior defender Dan Smith said. “The strength of our team is we have these games and these weekends and we bounce back and get better for it... this will be the point where we got better.”
CALIFORNIA 6, HARVARD 2
Five goals from Cal senior forward Christian Thierjung doomed Harvard to a 6-2 loss in the latter game of its California road trip, as Thierjung managed to get off eight shots on goal, the same as the entire Crimson squad.
After Cal’s attack failed to break through for the first 25 minutes, Thierjung opened the scoring after beating the offside trap and poking the ball past Harvard junior keeper Kyle Parks before sophomore forward Spencer Held doubled the advantage just ten minutes later.
In the second half, it was the Thierjung show, as the forward demonstrated his instinct for goal by finding the back of the net four times in the span of 26 minutes to secure the 6-2 scoreline. Despite the final score, it wasn’t all bad news for the Crimson.
Harvard sophomore forward Cesar Farias tallied his first career goal in the 50th minute to cut the deficit to 3-1 while freshman forward Philip Hausen set up classmate Matthew Glass for the second Crimson goal.
The team fired 16 shots at the Cal goal, eight of them on target, while Parks made a season-high six saves.
Though the Harvard defense was challenged constantly throughout the road trip, co-captain Andrew Wheeler-Omiunu emphasized the team will continue to stick to its defensive approach and adjust accordingly for each opponent.
“Every team presents a new challenge that you have to prepare for,” Wheeler-Omiunu said. “In terms of tightening up, we’ll stay in our defensive principles… outside of that it will be depending on the scout.”
STANFORD 3, HARVARD 1
The first nine minutes of the game was all Stanford needed as the Cardinal scored three goals in that span en route to a 3-1 victory over Harvard.
While the Crimson contained the Stanford offense for the remainder of the game, it was unable to find the goals it needed to get back in the game,getting off only three shots on goal.
“[We need] to be more patient with the ball in the attacking third,” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “When we’re more patient, really get setup possession wise we can be dangerous…. Secondly it’s about commitment getting to the box to score goal whether it’s on set pieces or the run of play.”
Less than a minute into the game, Cardinal freshman Tanner Beason converted from the penalty spot after teammate Foster Langsdorf was brought down in the box by Harvard junior Tyler Savitsky.
A few minutes later, Langsdorf slotted a shot past Parks after the Crimson goalie was caught off guard while attempting to distribute the ball from within his box.
Just before the 10 minute mark, Harvard conceded another penalty after Parks crashed into Langsdorf in the corner of the box.
Though the junior keeper guessed the right way, Langsdorf shot was too powerful to stop as the Cardinal took a three goal lead.
From there, the Crimson defense began to click as Parks and the backline withheld the Stanford attack for the remainder of the game.
While the Cardinal managed to get two more shots to hit the crossbar, it was unable to penetrate the Harvard backline as the Crimson fought to get back into the game.
“We did a really good job of continuing to do what we do and continuing to push even when results weren’t going our way,” Smith said. “The fighting reaction we had was really good.”
Harvard’s lone consolation goal came in the 80th minute, after a cross hit the arm of a Stanford player to give the Crimson a penalty that Freeman cooly slotted into the back of the net.
Stanford stymied any attempt at a late flurry of goals from the Crimson, as Harvard was unable to register a shot on goal for the remainder of the contest.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It's perhaps an overused saying in sports that games come down to a matter of inches or a matter of seconds.
But beneath the vast majority of cliches lie a basis of truth. This weekend’s Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet showed just that.
Competing Saturday in the annual meet, junior Courtney Smith claimed the individual women’s 5K title with a time of 19:07.8. In doing so, Smith continued her offseason momentum into the collegiate cross country season, edging out two close Yale runners—Frances Schmiede and Emily Waligurski—with times of 19:08.6 and 19:08.9, respectively.
The junior’s performance is a further extension of her successful summer competing in the Olympic trials in July in Eugene, Oregon.
While Smith grabbed the individual gold, Harvard as a team came in second to the Bulldogs who secured the remaining six of the top seven spots.
Harvard won the meet last year, in large part due to a second-place finish by Smith. Yet, given the different composition of each team entering this new season, Yale was heavily favored to do so this year. A quick glance at the top-10 finishers would all but show that the Bulldogs delivered.
“I’m so proud of Courtney and her performance this weekend,” sophomore teammate Malia Ellington said. “She is an incredibly hard worker and her dedication is an inspiration to all of us. I think this is just the beginning of an awesome season for both her and Harvard cross country.”
The victory underscores a great achievement on the part of Smith who looks to build upon her success last year. As a sophomore, she posted the eighth fastest time in NCAA history and, in doing so, qualified for the U.S. Olympic trials with a 32:08.32 in the 10,000 meter. Based on the weekend’s performance, her ceiling is
The Westchester, Pa., native went on to finish 22nd in the qualifying race, with only the top three advancing.
Smith also qualified for the NCAA championships last fall and was an indoor All-American during the season. Last year, she also ran the second fastest 5,000 meter time in the history of Harvard’s women’s teams at the University of Washington track meet. This time of 15:46.44 also happened to be the fourth-best time in the Ivy League and the eighth-fastest time in the nation.
In addition to Smith, teammates ­junior Elianna Shwayder, freshman Eliza Rego and freshman Gillian Meeks placed eighth, 13th and 14th, respectively.
In addition to a 17th place finish by senior Madeleine Ankhelyi, junior Fiona Davis notched a 19th-place finish while freshman Brooke Starn ended up in 21st. Despite only two top-ten finishes by the Crimson, it was the first-place finish from Smith that buoyed the Crimson to second place.
Although the Crimson missed out on the top spot this weekend, the squad did beat out Princeton, who was, prior to the race, ranked 23rd in a U.S. Track and Field and Cross Country Coaches Association poll.
By that same poll, the Harvard women’s team entered the meet 25th and ranked 13th in the Saucony Flo50 cross country countdown.
For Smith, though, the HYP Meet was a little bit different. With only three schools competing, the field was more open and she could just focus on her race.
“I would say one of my favorite memories during the race was around the mile mark where I felt very relaxed and happy because I glanced around briefly and saw all of my teammates right next to me,” Smith said. “Most college races are big invitationals with hundreds of runners so to have the unique experience of drawing strength and confidence from the proximity of all the girls that I share such great memories of hard work and fun with was really special.”
The women’s team will head to Seattle on Oct. 1st for its next meet in preparation for the NCAA Nationals, which will take place on Nov. 19 in Indiana.

It’s already more than halfway through September and some seniors may just realizing that they have a thesis to do...oops. Whether you had a great summer visiting wonderful places, doing super important work at your internship (yeah, sure we believe you weren’t just filing papers), or just chilling before senior year, we understand that it is easy to forget you on-campus responsibilities. But add-drop period is over, recruiting season is here, and you have some work to do. Here are things you should remember as you kick your thesis into gear:
Check if you can even start your thesis nowDifferent departments and concentrations have different guidelines and dates for doing a thesis. This means that the deadlines for agreeing to do a thesis might have already passed. Don’t get ready to accept long, late, coffee-filled nights when it will be all for naught. Email your concentration advisor, your thesis advisor or anyone else who can get you started. It might be nice if you already have a proposal in mind.
Find your hole and claim itLike an animal who needs to find a place for hibernation, you need to find a place to hide. But unlike animals preparing to hibernate, you will spend your long, cold, winter working instead of sleeping Your hole will be a place you can stay for hours on end without distraction. Make sure you have easy access to a bathroom, an outlet, and food/drink. Whether your preferred space is a library carrel you’ve reserved or the corner table in Starbucks, make sure you claim (and defend) your territory.
Create a GoFundMe, or at least a budgetDoing a thesis imposes a cost not only on your sanity, but also on your wallet. You could get a job to pay for your 4 a.m., caffeine-induced snacks, but this might add too much stress given your already-nonexistent amount of free time. So you’ll need to figure out a way to finance your misery, whether that is tapping into the goodwill of your family, friends and people, or just keeping track of your expenses for the semester. If you do decide to go for the crowdfunding route, make a funny title like “Help Me Survive this Year of Writing and Crying,” as practice for your eventual thesis title. You need every penny you can get to fund all the paper printing you will have to do.
Get a planner and keep track of your lifeA fancy planner with a pretty cover will make it at least look like you have your life together. If you don’t want to spend your life’s savings at Staples, use Google Calendar to keep track of your deadlines and advisor meetings, Make sure you have some semblance of order for the fall semester to reduce your stress about accidentally missing a meeting or assignment.
