After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
“I’m Not Part of Me” begins audaciously, with the lo-fi, punk-influenced sound of distorted guitars providing a glance into Cloud Nothings’ garage fuzz world. But any semblance of other punk stylings disappears after the first few seconds and quickly transitions into a bland, done-to-death mix of pop and alternative rock, a formula that the track sticks to for the next four minutes and twenty seconds. While “I’m Not Part of Me” is energetic and upbeat, using its wide appeal to advertise the upcoming “Here and Nowhere Else,” it refrains from experimenting and showing a range of musical talent. Cloud Nothings sound disquietingly similar to bands like Weezer and Jimmy Eat World circa the late 1990s and early 2000s—we’ve heard this sort of thing already, and instead of bringing something new to the table, the song sticks to the same tune and shows little capacity for growth. It’s easy to see Cloud Nothings as a follow-up to these bands nearly 10 years later, keeping to the garage-band aesthetic that has made this genre so successful. Hopefully, the album is not more of the same and instead returns to the grungier sound that the band utilized so successfully on 2012’s “Attack on Memory.” But considering the state of their single, it’s hard to see them doing anything more or less than what’s been done already.
 
“Here and Nowhere Else” is out on April 1 via Carpark and Mom + Pop in the United States.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Last week, the Justice Department announced that it would seek the death penalty for Dzokhar Tsarnaev, the accused perpetrator, along with his deceased older brother, of the Boston Marathon bombings last year that killed three people, wounded more than 260, and paralyzed an entire city. 
Prosecutors cited Tsarnaev’s lack of remorse and the “heinous, cruel, and depraved manner” of the attacks to argue that the death penalty was warranted. 
While we understand the visceral emotions surrounding last April’s terror, we remain categorically opposed to the death penalty—a conviction that requires us to adhere to it in even the most trying cases.
The core of the problem is that laws must be applied universally: To advocate the death penalty for Tsarnaev is inseparable from an endorsement of the policy writ large—one that places hundreds on death row on the basis of wrongful conviction, applies disproportionately to minorities, and can triple the cost of the judicial system.
The method of execution by lethal injection is especially worrisome. Last month, an Ohio inmate who executed by the injection of a new combination of drugs, appeared to convulse and choke for 10 minutes before dying, which seems the very definition of cruel and unusual punishment. The desire to punish heinous criminals is more than understandable, but we must apply our laws in the pursuit of justice, not righteous anger alone. 
The attorney general’s decision to seek the death penalty is especially disappointing given that he has previously opposed the death penalty because of the justice system’s imperfections. Holder released a statement saying that “the nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision.” But no matter how monstrous the criminal, one can’t argue the death penalty for one criminal without arguing the death penalty for all.
Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who also personally opposes the death penalty, supports the Justice Department’s decision nonetheless. Thomas M. Menino, Walsh’s predecessor, and a long-time death-penalty opponent, similarly told reporters, “I might think it’s time…that this individual serves his time and [gets] the death penalty.”
But dragging Tsarnaev through the inevitable years of appeals and hearings would only ensure his abiding notoriety and continuously call up the pain of the attacks for the victims and their families.
Though the trial is federal and will not be tried in Massachusetts courts, Tsarnaev’s attack was clearly directed at the Commonwealth. It’s worth noting that 57 percent of Massachusetts residents opposed the death penalty for Tsarnaev, compared to 33 percent who were in favor. 
Of course, Holder isn’t required to and shouldn’t adhere to public opinion in his prosecutorial decisions. But Massachusetts residents have debated and rejected the death penalty many times. If they were willing to reject the death penalty even after such a heinous crime, Holder could have done the same.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama nominally reaffirmed his commitment to universal health care, citing the success of the Affordable Care Act. Despite his dedication to free and fair medical services for Americans, he failed to comment on the essential life-saving global medicine funding programs that heavily rely upon the support of the American government. Instead he touted upcoming trade deals, completely glossing over the fact that such deals could cut off access to generic medicines worldwide. Not once did the president mention HIV or AIDS.
The major funding sources for worldwide HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis treatment, diagnosis, prevention and social services are the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. However, since 2009, the U.S. government’s fiscal commitment to these two programs has flatlined—funding has remained the same for the past five years.
Anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS reduces one’s risk of transmitting the disease by  96 percent, increasing life expectancy and decreasing the mortality rate. We cannot begin to tackle the HIV epidemic until the number of people on treatment exceeds the infection rate. Studies have also shown that for every dollar invested in HIV prevention, there is a $12 return (by preempting future infections and medical expenses).
There are currently 35.3 million individuals living with HIV/AIDS across the globe. As of 2013, 9.7 million people have been placed on treatment. This means that there are more than 25 million people around the world still in need of ART today, nearly 20 years after the introduction of the first effective HIV treatment.
A recent report found that if funding continues to stagnate, 3.9 million HIV infections that could have been prevented will occur in the next two years. The report found that the lifetime cost of these infections would exceed $47 million (including treatment, care, and labor lost).
Another serious threat to universal access to care, generic medicines, and other pharmaceutical must-haves on the global scale is the potential trade deal upon which President Obama only momentarily remarked: the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.
Obama only noted that “new trade partnerships with Europe and the Asia-Pacific will help them create even more jobs.” In fact, the repercussions of this trade deal—at home and abroad—are much more immediate, with the potential to harm many people and put entire populations at risk.
The TPP is under secret negotiation through the office of the United States Trade Representative, along with 12 other countries, and the lack of transparency around the trade deal has drawn a great deal of press. And with plans to fast-track the TPP, there will be little opportunity for congressional input.
The deal has environmental activists, internet privacy protectors, and labor groups up in arms, but it has yet to draw attention commensurate with the devastating effects it would have on access to medicines. According to the community watchdog group Public Citizen, the TPP will “expand pharmaceutical monopoly protections and trade away access to medicines.”
The intellectual property provisions of the TPP will expand the scope of patent protection and extend pharmaceutical patent terms. In addition, it gives multinational corporations more control over know-how information and data regarding their products. Under the provisions, pharmaceutical companies can refuse to publicize clinical trial data, impeding generic companies from obtaining the regulatory approval needed to put their product on the market.
These provisions ultimately delay the introduction of affordable, essential medicines where they are needed most and place the interest of pharmaceutical corporations above the public health. It is no coincidence that half of the 12 biggest corporations in pharmaceutical industry are American. In an era where medicines are commodified and health can only be bought, trade deals like the TPP further devastate efforts made in providing universal access to care.
With the TPP in its final stages of negotiation, the time to act is now.
To wage a serious fight against the rapidly growing epidemics in the world today, universal access to medicines must become a priority to the U.S. government. It warrants a mention in the State of the Union, and a prominent place on our legislators’ lists of action items.
PEPFAR and the Global Fund must receive the increased attention and funding hikes commensurate with the threat of new infections and preventable deaths. While President Obama has taken great strides on the insurance front and the provision of non-discriminatory medical services domestically, the potential TPP deal could drastically change the treatability of modern epidemics.
Frozen funding for the two largest provisions (the Global Fund and PEPFAR) to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and other illnesses could turn preventable, treatable illnesses into insupportable, incurable conditions. Policy and funding can make a real difference.
If our lawmakers won't face facts, it is up to students and constituents across the U.S. to make it known that they are, in the most urgent matters of life and death, continually falling short.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The extra point in football is, in many ways, a lot like cheap beer: it’s easy, it’s been around a while, and you really wish you had some more when your team is losing.
Recently, however, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has begun to float rumors that the league is considering doing away with theextra-point attempt, making touchdowns automatically worth seven points except for the case where teams decide to try a two-point conversion, which would be worth six or eight depending on if they succeed. Other than being eight years too late for Tony Romo, Goodell’s plan pales next to more appealing options.
To give some context, NFL kickers last year missed just five of 1,261 extra point attempts—good for a 99.6 percent accuracy rate. Frankly, that’s ridiculous. I’m a grown man and I miss the toilet far more often than that.
Because not much has changed over time—in 2001, kickers converted at a 98.1 percent rate—this isn’t the result of a generation of supernatural kickers. Why bother, then? Especially with All-Pro Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowskiinjured last year on a point-after attempt, Goodell is arguing that the try needlessly puts people in danger. It’s a bit of an ironic stance for a commissioner who presides over a league that allegedly concealed research about concussions and is trying to expand the season to 18 games, putting players at risk to get more money in owners’ pockets.
Even if we take Goodell at his word, there are many more engaging ways to make the point-after try interesting. Moving it back from the two-yard line has been a common suggestion, but to make it interesting the ball would need to be pushed far back. Consider that NFL kickers made an absurd 67.1 percent of their kicks from at least 50 yards this year and an even more staggering 89.7 percent of kicks from 18 to 49 yards.To make the kick non-automatic, the ball would have to be moved back to around the 25-yard line. The top 20 field goal kickers converted 40-49 yard field goals at an 89 percentclip this year, so it would introduce some suspense into the game
But that’s a boring solution. Lest this viewing audience forget, this is America. We make golfers hit their one-foot putts and pitchersthrow the four pitches foran intentional walk. We resisted instant replay in baseball and refuse to review every play in football because if we got every play right, there would be nothing to complain about.
And if there’s anything distinctly American, it’s complaining about people not being able to do their jobs.
It’s why Glenn Beck has a job. It’s why Jon Stewart has a job to complain about Glenn Beck not being able to do his. If we truly want to eliminate extra points and make every play interesting, it wouldn’t be long before field goals fall under the same category. With the kickoff also in danger of being eliminated, that might make kickers the first employees in history to have their jobs threatened because they were just too good at what they do.
Instead of getting rid of the extra point altogether or even making it more challenging, we should go back a century, when position players handled the placekicking.
One option is going to the rugby method of having the player that scored make the kick, but I’m fairly sure America fought a war 250 years ago so that we didn’t have to take tips from Britain. Having coaches designate one offensive starter to take all the kicks would reduce the strain on practice time, even if it leads to the Browns inevitably taking an offensive tackle ninth overall who can barely bench the bar but can nail a field goal from 45 yards out. Were that not good enough, giving opposing coaches the ability to designate the kicker could be an interesting wrinkle, especially since nobody loses when Romo has more work on special teams.
Ultimately, I’d like to believe that Goodell is floating this idea with intentions on serious reform—moving the kick back or having a non-kicker take it—instead of just using the issue as a way of distracting from the league’s more serious safety issues and the fact that a judge is demanding that the NFL pay more money in its settlement with injured retirees.
New Englanders have each spent four and a half hours over the last seven years watching Steven Gotskowski make 360 straight PATs—delays that likely left a lot of dishes unwashed and driveways unshoveled.
It’s a (mildly) serious issue, y’all.
After a year where his league has seen its share of bad press, fixing this problem in the right way would offer a small measure of redemption for the commissioner—after all,if you want to take cheap beer away, you better have a good alternative.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Every election season, Harvard’s undergraduate population bubbles over with enthusiasm for Barack Obamas and Elizabeth Warrens—standard-bearers of the well-behaved, mainstream liberalism that sets the cultural tone on campus. Students will pledge fealty to the sixties’ hallmark ideals: grassroots creativity, self-expression, lifestyle experimentation. But contrary to popular imagination, they will continue to lead overwhelmingly conservative lives.
Nothing illustrates this principle more starkly than the strange reality of marijuana at Harvard: that is to say, it’s rarer than you might expect. On the campus where Timothy Leary once conducted lab experiments with much harder drugs, only 35% of 2012’s graduating seniors claimed to have ever tried marijuana—as compared to 47% of American college students, by the Harvard School of Public Health’s account. This is not for lack of intoxication, however. By contrast, a substantial 67% admit to drinking alcohol at least once a week, with 93% admitting to have tried the liquid drug at least once.
All things being equal, I’m struck by the profundity of the gap. We might do well to experience the graces of a plant thought widely to combat stress, increase empathy, and spur creativity. And unlike alcohol, marijuana is not known to precipitate violence, hangovers, or cirrhosis. Recall, this is not a case for decriminalization—Massachusetts has already done it—nor for legalization, which most well-trained Harvard liberals support in abstract, and which Washington and Colorado have already come to do. It’s a case for experimentation.
Quite reasonably, it is common for Harvard’s hard-drinking weed-abstainers to cite the legality argument: in most American jurisdictions, though alcohol consumption is legal after the age of 21, marijuana remains unambiguously illegal. However, the calculus is fundamentally different in Massachusetts, where strict laws on underage drinking coincide with the decriminalization of personal marijuana possession. The penalty on state books for possession of under an ounce is a maximum, seldom-levied fine of $100, grouping it as a civil offense among the ranks of such heinous crimes as distracted driving.  For the majority of Harvard undergrads who are under 21, smoking a joint is no more illegal than taking a shot of stinging cold Rubinoff. And frankly, it’s much better for you.
Without direct subjective experience of marijuana’s effects, it can be hard for us to avoid being tinted by the canards of Reefer Madness and grade-school prescriptions like “Just Say No.” Contrary to David Brooks’ pig-headed claims, marijuana alone will neither make you crazy, nor lazy, nor dumb. According to Lyons et al.’s 2004 meta-analysis of twin studies, regular users of marijuana showed no significant cognitive or psychological deficits compared to their abstaining twins. Additional research has suggested that beyond the short-term, marijuana’s ill effects are negligible and reversible. Moreover, as any average weed smoker could tell you, studies have suggested that smoking marijuana can actually confer short-term benefits in terms of abstract reasoning and pattern recognition. The lived consensus is clear: marijuana makes for a lucid, mellow, non-toxic experience.
And though teetotalers might have nothing to gain by this line of reasoning, marijuana is a safer substitute for alcohol—the intoxicant of official sanction at proper parties, receptions, and monotheistic rituals. Despite its ubiquity in agricultural and industrial civilizations, alcohol has always come with a distinctively dark side. On a routine basis, it causes hangovers, vomiting, and weight gain; when abused, it often spurs domestic violence, bar fights, and sexual aggression. On particularly bad nights, it can lead to a fatal case of poisoning.
Marijuana, rated as both less dangerous and less habit-forming than alcohol, carries none of these nefarious associations. In “The Third Chimpanzee,” Jared Diamond describes intoxication as a deep-seated, universal human phenomenon. If that is so, why not consider substituting out alcohol, at least occasionally, for something calmer, safer, and less addictive?
Harkening to its countercultural associations, the marijuana issue is finally a test of our open-mindedness, our ability to question authority. For what it’s worth, most Harvard students have a rules problem: as a Crimson mentor of mine once summarized it, “Harvard is a school made up of kids who sat in the first row of the class in grade school and probably ratted out those passing notes in the back. We got into Harvard by showing respect—nay, devotion—to social rules, and rebellion just isn’t in our blood.” There’s nothing inherently subversive about marijuana, yet substituting it for alcohol would be a near-harmless way to get Harvard students into the habit of occasional rule-breaking and convention-flouting. In a world packed with arbitrary injustices and limitations, you bet we need it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Allston residents disagree on what to name the intersection of North Harvard Street and Western Avenue, an area destined to be the retail and residential hub of Harvard’s development in Allston over the next ten years.
While many refer to the intersection as “Barry’s Corner,” the Allston Square Association, led by local landowner Reynold M. McKinney, is pushing to rename the area “Allston Square.”
According to McKinney, who has lived in Allston for 44 years, “Allston Square” more appropriately defines the location and identity of the neighborhood.
“It is about time the Metro-Boston area calls us by the name we were given hundreds of years ago in honor of Washington Allston,” McKinney said, referring to the American painter and poet after whom the neighborhood of Allston is named. Allston graduated from Harvard College in 1800.
McKinney has posted petitions around the neighborhood to record support for the name change. He said he has received almost 200 signatures. The petition is one step of the official renaming process determined by the Boston Redevelopment Authority and the Department of Transportation, McKinney said.
Other Allston residents said that changing the name of the intersection is an affront to the important history of the neighborhood.
“Through the generations, it’s always been Barry’s Corner to us,” longtime resident Tom Lally said, adding that the name Barry’s Corner can be found on maps that date back to the early 1900s.
Allston residents called the history of the neighborhood named Barry’s Corner one of the “tragedies of urban renewal.” During the 1960s the residents of Barry’s Corner, a tiny neighborhood in of 52 structures and 71 families, fought to remain in their homes despite the City of Boston’s decrees that the neighborhood buildings were blighted and must be demolished. Families were evicted one by one over eight years until a squadron of over 50 Boston policemen were required to remove the remaining holdouts amidst a protest of over 100 Allston residents in 1969.
According to Rita M. DiGesse, a Harvard-Allston Task Force member and resident of Allston for over eight decades, retaining the Barry’s Corner name is an important reminder of the perils of urban renewal.
“All these poor people got thrown out of their houses,” said DiGesse, who knows current Allston families who had been evicted from Barry’s Corner over four decades ago. “It shouldn’t happen again.”
Lally echoed the importance of preserving a local neighborhood name, especially in the face of Harvard’s expansion into the area.
“Washington Allston is a Harvard person,” he said, adding that the whole Allston neighborhood is named after the 19th-century painter.
The intersection will be the site of extensive Harvard development over the next decade, including a project named “The Barry’s Corner Retail and Residential Commons,” spearheaded by University-hired firm Samuels & Associates. Last April, the Boston Redevelopment Authority approved the Commons, which will contain 325 housing units and 40,000 square feet of residential space. Harvard’s ten-year Institutional Master Plan for development in Allston calls for a number of other projects near the site.
Local residents said the dispute over what to name the intersection represents the tension in North Allston between a rich history and a rapidly approaching future.
“There’s a hope for a new future in that part of Allston,” Brighton resident Kevin M. Carragee said. “But I don’t think that runs counter to keeping the name.”
Despite the fact local residents have rallied around either “Barry’s Corner” or “Allston Square,”  the official name of the intersection is Anthony J. Vaccaro Square, according to a Department of Transportation spokesperson quoted in The Boston Herald.
In the end, some residents said that regardless of the official name, locals will continue calling the intersection what they have been for decades.
“Names are stubborn things,” said James Madden, project manager at an affordable housing nonprofit that operates in Allston. “Anyone who wants to call [Barry’s Corner] something else will have a tough slog at it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Mark E. Zuckerberg envisioned Facebook as a tool for students to create an online network of friends. This past summer, nearly a decade after it was founded, Stephen A. Turban ’17  used the social medium to connect with other classmates who were fond of the Mediterranean dip hummus.
Turban, then an incoming student, wrote a post on the Facebook page for the Class of 2017 about bringing hummus to his freshman seminar.
“It ended up being like, ‘Hope you’re taking this class. If you do, I’ll be the one bringing the hummus,’” he said.
Turban’s comment caught the attention of one of his fellow classmates, who shared his love of hummus and soon became his virtual friend.


“Literally for the next, like, two months until school started, we just talked about hummus on Facebook,” Turban adds. “We had like one message a day or two days. It was awesome.”
Turban, along with 97 percent of the freshman class, has a Facebook account. Since the creation of the social network, Turban’s story is not entirely atypical among Facebook users who have found friends, fellowship, and community at Harvard, even before they step foot through the gates of Harvard Yard.
While Facebook has undoubtedly made students at Harvard feel more connected, academics and individuals who have worked with students over the past decade are not sure whether it has truly brought the Harvard community closer together.
THE AGE BEFORE LIKES
Before Facebook emerged on Harvard’s campus, students socialized in ways both similar and different to that of current undergraduates, say Harvard administrators who have witnessed how the social network has shaped students’ life over the past decade.
Adams House Co-Master John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 recounts how, even 15 years ago, students used different means to reach out to each other.
“Every room had a phone that was working, and, in fact, in the beginning phones weren’t allowed in the dining hall,” Palfrey said. “You weren’t allowed to talk in the dining hall on your phone because it would disturb other people.”
Those rules—and the popularity of those signature red phones—disappeared as students began taking advantage of rapidly advancing mobile technology and email capabilities, Palfrey said.
“People at first didn’t really know what to think about email, but really pretty quickly it became a relatively serious communication device,” he said.
Initially, many students utilized Facebook as just another substitute for talking on the phone, Palfrey said. However, he adds, as Facebook grew to accommodate different forms of media such as photos and videos, students began to use Facebook to share their personal lives in the public sphere, an alternative to the business-like atmosphere of email.
Yet Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 said that when he was an undergraduate at the College—during the “dark ages,” as he referred to them—the core of the social scene was largely familiar to present-day campus life.
“There was a lot of hanging out,” he said. “People were pretty studious, but they would look forward in their free time once out of the library or once away from studying just to shoot the breeze. Oftentimes it was in your own suite.”
Similarly, Resident Dean of Ivy Yard Michael C. Ranen, who was a tutor in Winthrop House when Facebook was created, said that students in the pre-Facebook era simply used older social media services, such as MySpace and Friendster before that.
Even after Facebook was created, Ranen said, the nascent network was far from the expansive and dynamic medium that it is today.
 “I would said that early use of Facebook was almost like a collection of friends,” Ranen said. “There wasn’t as much sharing going on,” he said.
ADDING MORE FRIENDS
Since that preliminary phase, Facebook has rapidly evolved, transforming the way that users can present, disseminate, and locate information about themselves, their acquaintances, and even the individuals they may never even.
 
This increased connectivity has shaped and continues to shape the lives of Harvard students from the moment they step foot on the Yard to well after graduation, and many Harvard affiliates say that the social network has helped foster connections and sustain relationships across the Harvard community.
For instance, last spring Facebook helped prospective students get to know each other before they arrived on campus. When a city-wide lockdown in April triggered the cancellation of Visitas, the College’s campus preview weekend, the Class of 2017 Facebook group “played a vital role” in connecting admitted College students with current students, Harvard Admissions Office spokesperson Amy A. Lavoie wrote in an email to The Crimson.
According to Lavoie, the hope is that the page, which was created by Harvard but is entirely student-driven, can allow students can get to know each other and ask questions.
Ranen, who presides over several freshman dormitories, said that he thinks the current freshman class grew closer due to the conversations and connections that took place in the Facebook group.
“They really did build their own community,” he said.
Facebook has also helped former students connect many years after their graduation. Dingman said that Facebook has helped his classmates reconnect.
“I’ve seen it with my classmates from college who have discovered one another many years after graduation,” he said. “It’s been through social media, and there’s been sort of an excitement about, ‘Well, let’s renew ties.’ Probably wouldn’t have happened if you had to dig up a first-class mailing address.”
Mikolaj J. Piskorski, an associate professor at the Business School who studies the effects of social media on everyday life, agrees, adding that photos and status updates help individuals stay in touch.
“Facebook gives people a platform to reconnect with other people,” he said. “People are apt at using the information that they have gathered on Facebook to start conversations.”
Research also has shown that platforms like Facebook have allowed for people to meet who might not have met otherwise, Piskorski said.
“We know that 20 percent of the new marriages in this country originate online,” Piskorski said. “About 50 percent come from dating sites, such as Match.com, and the other 50 percent come from sites like Facebook. Facebook has made a huge impact on how we meet people, both friends and romantic relationships.”
BREADTH OVER DEPTH?
At the same time, both academics and observers of student life at Harvard worry about the impact of Facebook on the depth and nature of student connections on campus. Many argue that students use Facebook for reasons other than expanding interpersonal relationships, leading to isolation, distraction, and inauthenticity on a platform that seems to encourage quantity over quality of relationships.
According to Piskorski, looking at photos and profiles of other people constitutes about 80 percent of the average individual’s Facebook activity.
And while Facebook has made it easier to not only access but also disseminate personal information, many feel that much of the information shared lacks depth, leading to more superficial relationships.
“I think what Facebook did was it enabled you to tell your friends and not-so-close friends more trivial things,” Palfrey said.
Ranen said that he has noticed that students often do not use Facebook as a means to connect with their immediate circle of friends.
Students can also use Facebook to present a disingenuous portrait of their lives to students who already feel inadequate, Dingman said.
“There’s another aspect of Facebook that I hear from freshmen that I think is very concerning, and that is that you’re more aware of the activities of a broader group of people regularly,” he said. “[Students] don’t usually post that ‘I’m having a miserable day and I got a B- in my Ec10 midterm and I have no plans for tonight.’ They’re more inclined to post something that they’re right out in the mix having a jolly time, and that means the person viewing is left feeling like, ‘Am I the only one without a robust plan?’”
Furthermore, administrators like Dingman worry about the consequences of Facebook and technology use more generally. What’s meant to create new connections oftentimes leads to isolation and alienation, said Dingman, describing a situation in which he witnessed every person in a room on their cell phones avoiding communication with one another.
Palfrey said that he feels that Facebook can fuel student procrastination, mentioning that current workshops on campus offer strategies for combating the incessant distraction of Facebook and other social media alternatives.
“I think pretty rapidly Facebook became a competitor to work as opposed to a tool for work,” he said.
Despite these caveats, all of the Harvard affiliates interviewed for this story agreed that Facebook’s impact, while perhaps mixed in its benefits, has been a powerful one.
“It’s a phase. It’s a significant phase,” said Palfrey, adding that “I certainly don’t think it’s the destruction of society or education or Harvard or whatever.”
“I think there’s no rolling it back,” Dingman said. “It is here to stay.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
Members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences offered little feedback on a draft of what could be the College’s first-ever honor code at their monthly meeting Tuesday, after Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris asked to table discussion of a requirement that students sign an affirmation of integrity on all academic work.
 
Harris’s comments, which elicited just three questions from members of the faculty, centered on the benefits of student engagement with academic integrity, while refraining from voicing a strong opinion against or in favor of one of the most controversial sections of the draft.
 
“I do want to stress that everything that we’re proposing here, with one exception...is the product of a lot of research,” Harris said, singling out the integrity declaration on each piece of written academic work. Harris, chair of the Academic Integrity Committee that drafted the code, said that the committee chose to include  the line because other schools tended to incorporate a similar requirement in their own code, and not due to research backing the potential efficacy of the stipulation.
 
In lieu of formal discussion, Harris promised to create “some kind of consulting group” to assess the requirement.
 
Despite Harris’s attempt to table the discussion, one faculty member raised concerns about the requirement, noting that many other faculty members felt similarly about the affirmation.
 
Harris responded by saying that the University could not avoid legal structures.
 
Physics professor Melissa E. B. Franklin asked about an honor code for faculty members, raising the question of a partnership between students and their professors regarding academic integrity.
 
For his part, Harris said that he did not see virtue in asking faculty members to sign a similar oath on all the work they create, but that they should play a role.
 
“I think the compact is again in making sure that we are presenting our students with the best-thought-out prompts, problems, assignments, whatever they may be,” he said.
 
Harris noted that the Academic Integrity Committee began its work in the 2010-2011 academic year, stressing that it “was not in response to any specific case or scandal.” Still, to some, the committee’s efforts have taken on greater significance in the aftermath of the Government 1310 cheating scandal, the largest at Harvard in recent memory.
 
Tuesday’s meeting also included the presentation of an FAS committee report on professors’ rights with regards to the dissemination of their course materials online.
 
The report—which dates from 2000 and was written to inform the administration’s review of the policy on outside activities outside the University—comes in response to a memo released by administrators last February that raised concerns among faculty members regarding the ownership of their intellectual property related to teaching on the Internet.
 
James T. Engell ’73, the committee’s chair, said that faculty members should be allowed to continue to publish lecture videos and course materials online and explained that “ongoing engagement between a faculty member and students in any institution or organization outside of Harvard” should be considered as teaching a course elsewhere. In particular, Engell said that professors should retain the right to teach online courses on non-Harvard platforms.
 
“There should be a sense of competition in online education,” Engell said, though he noted that by choosing to teach on other platforms, faculty members would give up the ability to ask the University for help if copyright right issues arose.
 
Administrators, including FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, will use the committee’s recommendations to help update the existing policy, which University President Drew G. Faust called “outdated.”
 
“We don’t want to just hurry up and write a new set of policies that’s going to be outdated two weeks after we write it,” Faust said, adding that a policy will be University-wide.
 
Engell’s presentation was not the meeting’s first mention of online courses. History professor Charles S. Maier ’60, a former Crimson Editorial chair,  asked that Harvard’s edX administrators address comments by Stanford president John Hennessy in an interview with the Financial Times, where he pointed out flaws in online education.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
 
In a series of student feedback meetings over the last week about what may become the College’s first-ever honor code, undergraduates raised concerns about their involvement in the approval process of the honor code and the judiciary board it would create.
The honor code draft was first laid out at a Jan. 28 meeting by student members of the Academic Integrity Committee. The draft includes an “affirmation of integrity” for students to sign on academic work and outlines the setup of a student-faculty honor board, separate from the existing Administrative Board, that would hear cases of academic dishonesty. Half the board’s membership would be students.
At last Thursday’s meeting, held in Kirkland, several students raised questions about the selection process for student members of the board. The current draft suggests that student honor board members be selected through a nomination and interview process rather than through a popular election to allow students “who might be less inclined to engage in any competitive election” to also be involved on the board.
Undergraduate Council President Gus A. Mayopoulos ’15, drawing from his personal experience in high school, asked why the Academic Integrity Committee opted for an honor board populated by students selected for the role instead of an “honor jury,” where students from across the College would be selected at random to hear academic integrity cases.
“I went to a high school with an honor code,” Mayopoulos said later on at Thursday’s meeting. “It seemed strange that there were six people in the whole school who were deemed appropriate to judge on others.”
 
Jonathan G. Jeffrey ’16, one of the student organizers of the feedback sessions, said that one of the main problems with implementing an “honor jury” would be providing the training needed to serve on an honor board to the entire student body.
 
Another attendee, Christopher B. Farley ’16, a Crimson editorial and business editor, said that students should have a say as to whether their case is heard before the Ad Board or the proposed honor board. If the honor code draft were implemented in its current form, the dean of the College has the authority to decide which body would hear a case that does not fall clearly under one’s jurisdiction.
“It’s important that students have some sort of a choice in terms of whether or not their confidential information will be presented in front of their peers, or in front of another board,” Farley said.
Others disagreed with Farley’s position, saying that in a system built around “trust” in their peers students should not be allowed to opt out.
Students at Thursday’s meeting also expressed concern about the fact that the honor code does not have to be approved by the student body before adoption. As it currently stands, in order to become policy, a draft of the honor code would have to go before the full FAS faculty for a vote. On Tuesday afternoon, faculty members discussed the draft at their monthly meeting, but they have yet to vote on it.
In addition to raising concerns about the roles that students and faculty members would play under the honor code, students who attended the meetings discussed details about the proposed policy itself. For example, at last Wednesday’s meeting in Cabot House, committee members and the two students in attendance discussed how often College students should be required to sign the integrity statement.
Christopher H. Cleveland ’14 said he would “hesitate” to require students to sign the statement frequently, adding that introducing them to the statement at the start of their college careers would be better than requiring incoming students to sign it at the end of high school. Terah E. Lyons ’14, a student member of the committee, suggested at multiple feedback meetings that an option would be to introduce students to the statement at the time of their matriculation to the College.
At all four of the feedback sessions, Academic Integrity Committee members framed the honor code as a way to ignite a discussion on campus about academic honesty. The group first proposed the honor code in April 2013.
Cabot House Co-Master Rakesh Khurana—a member of the committee, who was tapped last month to serve as the next dean of the College—echoed this sentiment at the most recent session in Straus Hall on Tuesday evening. He also spoke about the pressures that students face that might cause them to make poor decisions.
“As a House Master, one of the hardest things for me is when I see some of my students get in trouble, because everybody is a good person,” Khurana said. “What happens is that you can create conditions in which good people don’t do the right thing, and there’s a lot of things that we have to be more conscious of.”
“This is actually a vehicle to create conversations with faculty members,” Khurana added. “It’s a vehicle to create conversations with resident deans. It’s a vehicle to create conversations with your peers.”

This semester, 18 courses offered at the College have enrolled more than 200 undergraduates, up from 14 last spring, according to data retrieved from the website of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Registrar’s Office.
In keeping with recent history, Economics 10b: “Principles of Economics” has clinched the highest enrollment this semester with 662 students, the largest number of undergraduates taking the course since 2011, when the class had 689 students.
N. Gregory Mankiw, professor of Economics 10b, said that he believes his class’s high enrollment is due to the fact that students from all disciplines can benefit from studying economics.
“Harvard students know that to be an informed citizen in the world today you need to know economics,” Mankiw said, adding that the course has no cap. “It provides a very useful perspective for public policy.”
Mankiw’s two-semester introductory economics course, which has been one of the most popular courses offered in recent years, was trumped last spring by Statistics 104: “Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Economics.” While Stat 104 enjoyed an unusually high enrollment of 624 students last year, that number has been nearly halved, to 313 students this semester.
One probable reason for Stat 104’s decrease in enrollment is the introduction of Stat 102, which is geared toward pre-medical students, according to David P. Harrington, the course's professor.
“We haven’t had an introductory course for pre-meds before,” said Harrington, whose course has 115 students enrolled. “I think we drew away some of the students [from Stat 104], because there were a lot of life science and pre-medical students taking the course.”
Two General Education classes, Science of the Living Systems 19: “Nutrition and Global Health” and Culture and Belief 23: “From the Hebrew Bible to Judaism, From the Old Testament to Christianity,” were among the five highest enrolled courses this semester. Culture and Belief 23, which was last offered in the fall of 2012, has a class size of 397 undergraduates, while Science of the Living Systems 19 has 304 students enrolled.
Harvard School of Public Health professor Clifford W. Lo, who co-teaches Science of the Living Systems 19, said he is never sure what to expect with his course’s enrollments.
“The first year we had a preliminary enrollment of 80 and 250 showed up,” Lo said. He later added that pre-term planning, which predicted that approximately 150 students were interested in the course, generally does not help determine how many students will eventually take Science of the Living Systems 19.
Lo speculated that his course, which requires a final project in place of a final examination, has a reputation of being easy, but thinks that students are generally interested in global health and hopes the class will continue to attract interest.
“Someday I hope we can fit in Sanders Theatre, but right now I'm okay with Science Center B,” Lo said.
However, not all courses have experienced an increase in enrollment. Computer Science 181: “Machine Learning,” which enrolled 130 students last spring, dropped its enrollment to 68 students this semester.
Ryan P. Adams, assistant professor of Computer Science 181, said that this phenomenon may be due to the addition of several similar courses to Harvard’s course catalogue in the past year, like Computer Science 109: “Data Science,” and Statistics 183: “Learning from Big Data.”
“The students interested in these topics are now distributed over a broader range of courses than they were,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson.

Lucy A. Forster-Smith officially joined the Harvard community last Sunday as the Sedgwick Chaplain to the University and senior minister to the Memorial Church.
Reverend Jonathan L. Walton, Pusey Minister in Memorial Church and Plummer Professor of Christian Morals, said that Forster-Smith’s new position is the fulfillment of a wish he has had since he replaced Peter J. Gomes in 2012 as Pusey Minister—to hire someone with multi-faith experience at the chaplain level.
“In a community as religiously diverse, and fluid, and dynamic as Harvard…we really needed someone to serve in this chaplaincy,” Walton said.
Walton said that while interviewing potential candidates for the newly created position, it became clear early on that Forster-Smith, who has been a chaplain at Macalester College and authored the book "College and University Chaplaincy in the 21st Century: A Multifaith Look at the Practice of Ministry on Campuses across America," was the perfect fit.
“This is what she does, and she has literally written the book on multi-faith ministry,” Walton said.
Forster-Smith said that she is not coming to Harvard with a specific agenda, but rather decades of experience in the field of ministry and chaplaincy and a willingness to fully immerse herself in the community at Memorial Church and the University at large.
“I really love working on a campus, and I really value relationship,” Forster-Smith said. “[I will]  try as much as I can to attend many of the religious and spiritual organizations.”
Having studied music and philosophy in college, she said that she is also excited to be part of a community with many musical talents and intersections between faith and music.
“I think spirituality and music are hand in hand. It’s a transcendent experience when you step into a musical performance and also to perform,” she said.  “[I am] literally feeling this deep, deep gratitude to be able to be in a setting where there was beauty in such a way.”
Walton said that Forster-Smith will help members of the Memorial Church and the University “to remain in healthy dialogue with one another as we serve our respective communities.”
He noted that although he does not expect Forster-Smith to perform particular tasks or be concerned with certain matters solely because she is female, it is important to have women represented at all levels of the spiritual life.
“How can we say that we are trying to represent what God's kingdom looks like, yet we privilege only half of that kingdom,” Walton said, adding that gender equality is not only a practical, ethical, and moral problem, but also a theological one.
Forster-Smith is set to move into her office in Memorial Church next week. She will join 12 affiliated ministers, in addition ot Walton.
“I hope she has a long and fruitful term at Harvard,” Walton said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A new program entitled “Secure Exit” was installed in Widener and Lamont Libraries on Jan. 13 to help speed up exit times and improve security. The program utilizes a barcode scanner that security guards can use to check whether books are cleared to leave the library.
Secure Exit was developed by Harvard’s Library Technology Services from a basic plan created by Joshua Parker, head of access services for humanities and social sciences. The program was made to replace what librarians call the “stamp and slip” method, by which due dates are stamped on slips of paper inside the books.
“The program was created in direct response to issues that have been raised about long lines at those two libraries at peak times,” said Kira Poplowski, director of  communications for the Harvard Library.
Katie McGrath, director of administration for the Harvard College Library, said that library exit times shortened slightly in the first few weeks of the program’s implementation. She added that the hope is for the new system to continue to expedite the process as people become more accustomed to it.
Secure Exit is part of a greater effort to reduce wait times at library exits, where security guards continue to manually check bags. Recently, libraries have also added a second lane during peak hours.
Besides shortening exit times, another primary goal of the new program is to ensure the security of the collections.
“It is much harder to ensure the security of the collections with the stamp and slip,” McGrath said. “With bar scans it is much easier because it is querying a system that is keeping track of whether or not a book can circulate.”
McGrath and Parker worked together to ensure the proper rollout of the Secure Exit program by installing the necessary technology, training staff, and informing students and faculty of the change.
There is no set date to rollout the new program to the Fine Arts Library, Cabot Library, and Countway Library—the three other libraries where security guards check bags at exits—but McGrath said she hopes that the program will be implemented at these libraries later in the spring.
“I have been very pleased with it,” Parker said. “From what I’ve seen of it from speaking with library patrons and security guards, there have been positive comments.”

The two Harvard athletes in this week’s edition of the Athlete of the Week runners-up were stellar in Ivy League competition this past week. Both paced their respective squads on the road in victories for the Crimson.
Christine Clark, Women’s Basketball
 
With Harvard undefeated in the Ivy League coming into this past weekend, Clark made sure that streak continued on Friday. The senior guard picked apart the defense in the Crimson’s 78-68 win over Princeton at the Jadwin Gym, scoring 25 points on 6-of-12 shooting.
The Tuscon, AZ native contributed across the box score, shooting 2-of-4 from downtown, recording 4 offensive rebounds, and even blocking a shot. With Harvard’s lead in single digits near the end of the second period, Clark made sure the Tigers wouldn’t get any closer by converting 9-of-10 free throw attempts in the final six minutes of the game.
The 5’11” guard would finish the contest with 11 free throw makes, just one shy of her personal best. She even managed to collect the offensive board on the only shot from the charity stripe she missed all evening.
Jack Manchester, Men’s Swimming and Diving
 
On the road in New Haven for the annual HYP meet, Manchester managed to break a Yale pool record in his freshman season. The 6’3” swimmer took the 200-yard backstroke event with a time of 1:43.43, just .45 seconds ahead of Yale junior Rob Harder. That Saturday afternoon time was also good enough for a NCAA “B” cut time, one of the 12 such times that Crimson competitors earned over the two-day event.
A day prior, the Huntsville, NC native posted a 49.11 time in the 100 yard backstroke, which was good enough for sixth in a closely contested heat that saw the first and sixth place swimmers touch the wall within a second of each other.
Manchester is one of 12 freshmen on a No. 23-ranked Harvard squad that is still unbeaten in the Ivy League. A former state champion in the 100 yard backstroke and 200 yard freestyle back in high school, Manchester has translated his previous successes to immediate results in his first year with Harvard.

The Harvard women’s ice hockey team will just have to wait another year.
Two straight years of missing the Beanpot finals turned to three on Tuesday at the Conte Forum as the No. 3/5 Crimson (17-3-3, 13-2-2 ECAC) fell to Northeastern (14-12-2, 8-6-2 Hockey East). Despite a late rally by Harvard’s offense, a third period comeback effort fell short, and the Huskies took the matchup, 4-3.
The Crimson had not faced Northeastern in the Beanpot Tournament since defeating the crosstown rivals with a shootout in Feb. 2011, the last time Harvard proved victorious in the first round. The Crimson did, however, face the Huskies earlier this season in a 3-2 win on Jan. 4.
With just over a minute on the clock, interim Crimson head coach Maura Crowell pulled freshman goaltender Brianna Laing and launched a last-ditch effort to tie the game with 6-on-5 play.
Laing, who has played in just six games this season, split time between the pipes with sophomore Emerance Maschmeyer to notch eight saves and allow one goal. Maschmeyer, fourth in the ECAC for goals-against average, was benched five minutes into the second period after letting in three scores by Northeastern.
“[Laing has] played some big games for us and has been tremendous,” Crowell said. “I think both of our goalies are very good. We have all sorts of confidence in her ability. Emerance just wasn’t on. The goals that went in [were] not 100 percent her fault, but you can tell when a goalie is on and off. We wanted a change, and when you change goalies, it’s a momentum shift for your players too.”
The loss marked just the third time this season that Maschmeyer has let in more than two goals in a game.
The first period saw the Huskies take advantage of a Crimson squad sluggish in its own zone. Northeastern second-liners Kelly Wallace and Colleen Murphy both capitalized on open looks to bypass Maschmeyer and connect with the back of the net. Murphy put the Huskies on the board 6:41 into the first period and Wallace followed up with the goal of her own just six minutes later.
Harvard finally found an offensive break as sophomore forward Mary Parker took a handoff from sister Elizabeth, a senior forward, to drive the puck down the ice past the right side of Northeastern goaltender Chloe Desjardins.
Parker struck again in the third period to cut the Huskies’ lead to two, 4-2, and inserting herself into the rankings as the second leading scorer on the team.
“I have just been working really hard,” Parker said. “[I’ve been] trying to do anything I can to also help my team out throughout the ice and also drive hard to the net and be there when the puck’s there.”
After slow first and second periods, the Crimson offense came alive again. Five minutes after Parker’s score, junior center Samantha Reber penetrated Northeastern’s defenders to take an assist off teammates Briana Mastel and Miye D’Oench to slip a goal in past the crease and Desjardins.
And so, down just 4-3 with minutes melting off the scoreboard, Harvard emptied the net for a final try at the tie. It was too little too late for the Crimson, as right wings D’Oench and Sydney Daniels, as well as defenders Sarah Edney and co-captain Marissa Gedman, each launched attempts that were saved by Desjardins.
Desjardins finished the game with 27 saves and Maschmeyer and Laing combined for 18. While the Huskies took an edge in shots–11 to Harvard’s eight–during the first period, the Crimson outshot their opponents 22-11 during the remaining frames. Parker, Reber, and Daniels led the offensive surge for their squad with four shots apiece. Northeastern senior forward Brittany Esposito led all players with seven shots, none of which materialized as goals, but proved a threat from the left circle.
Despite speedy skating by the Harvard icewomen, it was a sleepy start to a Tuesday afternoon game that took the Crimson down.
“I do feel like early games for Harvard kids on Tuesdays are a little tough,” Crowell said. “I know several of them were running straight from class to get on the bus. I don’t know if it was a focus thing. It clearly took us a period-and-a-half to warm up. [But] again, no excuses. We come ready to play, no matter what time the game starts.”
The team returned to action just three days after a weekend on the road with two ECAC contests and will rest for only two before heading up to Hanover to face Dartmouth on Friday.
While this loss does not count towards Harvard’s league record, with just over a month until the ECAC Tournament, every game on out counts. Harvard tops the conference standings with 28 points, but second-place Clarkson breathes on the Crimson’s neck with 26 points, and Cornell is just a one point below in third.
“Every [game] counts,” Crowell said, “We just need to come ready to play for 60 minutes. I told these guys after the game, when they play well, they play so well. I do think they’re a fantastic team. I think if we can show that for a full 60 minutes, it’s going to be a fantastic finish for us.”

Back-to-back goals in the third period were not enough for the No. 3/5 Harvard women’s ice hockey team in the opening round of the 36th Annual Beanpot Tournament. The Crimson (17-3-3, 13-2-2 ECAC) fell Tuesday night in a 4-3 decision to Northeastern (14-12-2, 8-6-2 Hockey East) at Boston College’s Conte Forum.
A two-goal deficit after the first frame proved too much for Harvard to overcome, and the Huskies added a pair of goals in the second to extend their lead to 4-1 heading into the third stanza. The three-goal spread was the largest deficit the Crimson has faced all season long.
Only one other time during the 2013-2014 campaign had an opponent netted four goals against Harvard, but even then the Crimson still came out on top in the 5-4 win at Colgate last month. Though Harvard closed the gap against the Huskies with a pair of goals midway through the final frame, the Crimson could not find the late tiebreaker, suffering just its third loss of the season.
“I’d say we got off to a slow start, apparently, [but] made quite a game of it in the end,” interim head coach Maura Crowell said. “I thought for sure we were going to come up with that tying goal and push this to OT, but it wasn’t meant to be. I’m really proud of the way we battled back in the third period. It showed a lot of resilience, a lot of character. It’s a tough loss, but I was proud of the way we finished.”
Northeastern found a way to the back of the net against one of the top defensive fronts in the country. Heading into Tuesday’s contest, Harvard’s defense ranked fourth in the nation, allowing opponents on average a mere 1.18 goals per contest.
The Crimson seemed unable to stop the Huskies’ drive to the net for the first two periods. Sophomore goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer, who ranks third in the country with a .953 save percentage, let three slide through the crease before freshman Brianna Liang took over in net.
PROPS TO PARKER
With a 2-0 deficit halfway through the second—and with freshman defender Robyn White in the penalty box—sophomore Mary Parker found the back of the net to jumpstart the Crimson’s offense off an assist from the Elizabeth Parker, a senior defender and Parker’s older sister. It was just the third shorthanded goal for the Crimson all season.
“Right off the faceoff, the puck bounced right behind their center,” Parker said. “Elizabeth skated right through and got the puck, and right as she was going, I knew I had a jump to get there. She went around that first [defender], and then I just kept driving to the net.”
The younger Parker once again found herself launching another Crimson attack when she found the back of the net ten minutes into the third frame, narrowing the deficit, 4-2, with half of the final period remaining. The sophomore has become a source of offensive might for Harvard, registering 11 goals this season, and five goals in the past three contests.
BEANPOT BATTLES
Tuesday night’s contest featured a showdown between the top two perennial Beanpot powerhouses. Of the four Boston teams, Northeastern leads with 16 titles to its name, while Harvard is second with its 13 Beanpot championships. While the Crimson has historically been successful in the crosstown competition, Harvard has not seen that same success of late, losing its opening draw in the semifinals each of the past three years.
Last time out, the Crimson dropped a 2-1 decision to Boston College in the opening round but then went on to top Boston University, 3-0, in the consolation match. The year prior, Harvard fell, 5-2, to the Terriers in its semifinal match.
Each year, Harvard must navigate the annual four-team tournament while staying on top of its already-demanding regular season schedule. The mid-week games combined with weekend conference play make for a tough February stretch for the Crimson.
“We know the Beanpot is every February, and unfortunately the ECAC doesn’t give us relief on the weekend,” said interim Harvard coach Maura Crowell. “But that’s no excuse, we’ll be ready to go. I don’t think fatigue or anything like that played a factor in tonight’s game. They’re all big. They’re all big the rest of the way, and we know that. We’re prepared.”

When Michael Silva and Samir Faza set foot in Harvard Yard in the fall of 2011, they brought with them passion for a sport the school had yet to offer—triathlon.
“I was honestly shocked that there wasn’t a [triathlon] team,” Silva said. “All the other local schools have teams—BU, BC, MIT. When I was looking at schools, I was certainly looking at which schools had triathlon teams, and Harvard didn’t have one, which was really shocking.”
To resolve this issue, the duo wasted little time in getting to work. Silva and Faza founded the Harvard Triathlon Club Team their freshman year, and the two found members of the student body who shared their interest. Currently, five members serve as co-captains of the Triathlon team—Silva, Faza, classmate Joseph Brennan, graduate student Andrés Onetto, and sophomore Caitlin Begg. They joined the team with mixed backgrounds and differing levels of prior triathlon experience, a diversity that still defines the organization.
“The past experiences of our members have are hugely varied,” Faza said. “We have people involved with our shortest race [who] can barely run a 5K, or those who struggle with any distance of open-water swimming… On the other hand, we also have competitive [Iron Man competitors]…[and] an athlete from the Navy team who was one of their fastest racers.”
Regardless of whether they have been competing in triathlons for several years or are simply trying their hand at the sport, members of the club share one common theme: a draw to the sport’s combination of three different athletic components.
DIVERSE ROOTS
“I played football through high school,” Brennan said. “I stopped playing football [after] my senior year of high school, and started doing distance running… I have always been interested in doing triathlons. I have thought that it would be more interesting to do three sports instead of one.”
Silva is one of the most experienced triathletes on the team, with several years of experience already under his belt.
“I started [triathlon] in high school,” Silva said. “[I] got more involved in it senior year. Moving into college, I really got serious about it…[Triathlon] was a perfect balance with school, and a lot of people I’ve met here have found the same thing.”
Over the past two years, the team has grown from its two co-founders to a roster that boasts over 100 members. Roughly a dozen athletes regularly participate in competitions.
“Soon after we founded the team, we got Joseph, Andreas, and Caitlin,” Faza said. “The five of us are the co-captains. Last year we had our first race in May—we had 15 people come out, and it was really amazing to see the response that we got. We recently broke 100 [members] on our e-mail list, which is very exciting.”
COMPETITIVE CAMRADERIE
“Having 15 people on our first race was no small feat,” Silva said. “There are very established teams that bring fewer, and we were one of the two biggest teams there. We fielded more racers than BU, which competed at Nationals last year. Such turnouts bode well for our team’s future.”
The team finds support not only from its own athletes but also from the collegiate triathlon community as well.
While the triathlon is not an NCAA-sanctioned sport, USA Triathlon—the national governing body for the sport—has a collegiate division comprised of several regional conferences. Harvard is a member of the Northeast Collegiate Triathlon Conference.
“Everyone had a ton of school spirit,” Silva said, reminiscing about the team’s first race last season at the Lake George triathlon. “Everyone was rocking their school gear—Boston University, Boston College, West Point.”
“We were miserable trying to beat them during the race,” Silva said. “But after we all finished, the Boston University team came over and said, ‘Awesome race, welcome to the conference.’ Their coach also introduced himself and invited us to work out with his team in the future. Such camaraderie, I believe, is what makes triathlon a lot different from other collegiate sports.”
TRAINING DAY
While it is a club sport, the triathlon team takes training very seriously. Members often train every day, and the programs vary from swims at Blodgett Pool and spinning sessions to lifts and group runs. “Sunday runs are our signature runs,” Faza said. “We meet in Winthrop courtyard, stretch as a group, then run in several different pace groups. As the year goes on, we begin holding specialized practices.”
While staying true to their commitment to the sport, the team also recognizes the tight schedule of Harvard student-athletes.
“We are really flexible—a lot of people on our team participate in other sports or extracurriculars, and we want to make sure these people can make it to as many practices as possible,” Silva said.
The team aspires to provide its members with a close community of triathletes, while supporting their efforts to balance the sport with academic and extracurricular commitments.
“The triathlon is incredibly intimidating to a lot of people,” Faza said. “A lot of it comes from the swimming portion and the long distances, in addition to the financial and logistical barriers. That’s why we are here. We can give people the opportunity to train on their commuter bikes or give them a spinning lesson, go on a group run, and lift together.”
A COMMUNITY OF ATHLETES
“The biggest thing that we can provide is the community of people,” Silva said. If anyone is actually interested in running a triathlon, we will do our best to make it happen.”
In terms of competition, the team hopes to solidify its presence in the Northeast Regional Conference. They will have their chance this April as the squad heads west to Arizona to compete at the USAT Collegiate Triathlon Championship in search of a national title.
Above all, just like any other varsity or club athletic team, the Harvard Triathlon Team proudly wears the “H” on the collegiate scene.
“At our first race of the season, when the teams gathered around the starting area saw our Harvard racing gear, their eyes open up,” Faza said. “[Our arrival] has become news around the conference, and people have become very receptive and welcoming of us. We feel a lot of weight on our Harvard shield.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the No. 1 Trinity men’s squash team lost a home game, the Harvard class of 2017 was still in diapers. 18 years and 162 wins later, the Bantams found themselves outmatched by the No. 2 ranked Crimson at home on Tuesday night.
Harvard (12-0, 5-0 Ivy) swept the first five matches on the ladder and the bottom two spots for a convincing 7-2 victory at Trinity (15-1) on Tuesday night. The last time the Crimson came away with a win against the Bantams was in 1998.
“I think a lot of it was coming in and accepting that we were ready,” co-captain Gary Power said. “We were ranked second, and we wanted to go out there and prove that we were the best. In that sense [the rankings] helped because we had something to prove.”
In the first match of the night, junior Tyler Olson braved the masses of Trinity fans to dish a sound defeat to his opponent, senior Matthew Mackin, by winning three consecutive games.
“A big shout out has to go to Tyler Olson at the number nine position,” Power said. “At the number nine position he goes on the court first. There was a big crowd and a lot of people cheering for his opponent, but he came out there and wasn’t fazed at all… He put us in a good position for the rest of the match.”
The Crimson won two additional matches in three games. One win came from senior Ali Farag in the number one spot and the other from Power, who played as the number four seed. Harvard had already secured the win before Farag and Power played.
“The game was already won by the time I went on the court,” Power said. “But I’m happy I won, and hope that I carry on winning to contribute to the team.”
The game that dealt the Bantams its first loss against the Crimson in fifteen years was that of co-captain Brandon McLaughlin. McLaughlin defeated Trinity’s number two seed, Karan Malik, in a close 3-2 match. After a tight four games to tie the match, 2-2, McLaughlin managed to notch another win for Harvard with a decisive fifth game victory, 11-4.
In an earlier match, freshman Dylan Murray dropped only one game to junior Vrishab Kotian. However, Kotian came within two points of winning in each game, and the fourth set became a tough back-and-forth rally that lasted up to 13 points.
“We’re obviously very thrilled to win,” Farag said. “But we don’t want to get overexcited or overconfident. We just want to keep the momentum going.”
Senior Nigel Koh demonstrated his ability to stay calm under pressure against his opponent, junior Elroy Leong, in the fifth spot. After a long battle in the first game and a dropped second game, the match was tied at 1-1. Nigel Koh managed to come back strong in the last two games, winning both by a margin of eight points.
“[Trinity] might be better on paper,” Farag said. “But we knew we had a very good chance, and we just didn’t want to get frightened beforehand. We just talked about it individually, took it step by step, and everyone focused on his own match. It paid off.”
The only two Harvard losses came from matches played by freshman Bryan Koh in the sixth seed and sophomore Nick Hopcroft in the seventh spot. Hopcroft was unable to best Trinity junior Moustafa Hamada, and fell 4-1 after Hamada won the first two games.
Bryan Koh went to five games with Bantams’ sophomore Zeyad Elshorafy, but he fell short in the end and lost, 3-2, in a heartbreaking last game that went to 17 points.
“I was so proud to see [Bryan Koh] battling with [Zevad Elshorafy],” Farag said. “[Elshorafy] is a very good player, and I thought he had the edge on winning before the game, but now I am confident that if Bryan plays him again in nationals that he has a very good chance of winning.”
Playing as the number eight seed, senior Tom Mullaney outplayed freshman Affeeq Ismail in four close games.
Farag notched his tenth consecutive win this season as the number one player, and Mullaney, Olson, and Power lead the team with twelve wins each.
“Our coach said a very nice line before the match,” Farag said. “He said ‘We’ve worked a lot this year, we know we’re fitter than any team. We know we’re better than any other team, all we have to do is just play.’ It was nice, and I think it made our team believe.”

It’s Wednesday! You’re probably relieved that you’re halfway through the week but also terrified at the prospects of actually getting through the entire day. Why not pass the time away by taking our 100 percent accurate scientifically proven dhall personality quiz!
 When you first walk into the dhall, you immediately go to:
1. The salad bar: You are a responsible person, balancing not only your work, extracurriculars, and social life, but also your meals! You know that a healthy dose of greens will help you look and feel great. But then again, you may just be feeling guilty about the unspeakable amount of midnight snacks you ate last night and are therefore forcing yourself to eat healthy.
 2. The cereal dispensers: You are a no-frills type of person. You know what’s good and will go for it—even if it means three bowls of Cinnamon Toasters.
3. The grill: You are the creative type, channeling your innovative skills to create culinary concoctions every night for dinner. Your friends may scoff at your hipster glasses and make fun of you for being “too artsy”, but you know that deep down they’re jealous about your Garden burger and chicken panini (Disclaimer: we’ve never actually tried this).
4. The entrées: You are a risk-taker and you like taking chances, even when it comes to what you may be eating tonight. You fully embrace surprises, whether it means a Scheherazade Casserole or Beef Fajita Fettucine.
IN THE ATMOSPHERE
Cambridge is forecasted to get 6-10 inches of snow by later this morning. Unfortunately, no sign of classes being cancelled...yet. Head to the dhall before class to fill up a thermos of hot chocolate to help you survive the long trudge to section. You can always bring your TF a freshly-made snowball as a gift.
 IN THE D-HALLS
Lunch:Red Spiced Chicken BreastBeef FajitasRoasted Vegetable Panini
Dinner:Cider Roasted Pork LoinHerb Roasted Whole ChickensVegetable Jambalaya
EVENTS
Don’t hear enough from your professors in class? Stop by Sanders Theatre at 8 p.m. for Harvard Thinks Big V, in which six Harvard professors will deliver TED-style talks on a wide range of topics. Dean Pfister will be delivering the opening remarks—so we’ll be there. Be sure to pick up your tickets at the Harvard Box Office starting at 5 p.m.!
 But if you’ve had enough lectures to last you for a while, check out Dunster House Opera’s production of Cosí Fan Tutte in the Agassiz Theatre at 7 p.m. The show is an opera about a wife swap. We don’t know if it’ll match up to the artistic genius of the ABC reality show, but it’s worth a shot. Tickets are available at the Harvard Box Office for $5 with HUID.

We may be over halfway through the school year, but you’ve probably still not met one of those mythical Mass. Hall unicorns yet. Proving they really do exist, a current Mass. Hall resident and one of Flyby’s very own Tasnim Ahmed ’17 is here to dispel some myths and reveal some secrets about what life is like when you get to brush your teeth just feet away from the one and only Drew Gilpin Faust.As a freshman living in Mass. Hall, I get many different reactions from people once I tell them where I live. There’s certainly a lot of intrigue surrounding the oldest dorm at Harvard that houses 13 freshmen and Drew Faust’s office, but I’ve kept quiet about the secrets of Harvard's smallest home…until now.Are you the chosen ones?Absolutely…at least, that’s what we tell ourselves. There’s a reason our dormitory housed five founding fathers, including former president John Adams. We are the “Golden Children.”Why were you chosen?Unfortunately, this is classified information that cannot be disclosed because it poses a threat to national security.Mass. Hallers Are Rarely SeenThere is common saying that seeing a Mass. Hall student outside his or her dorm is like seeing a unicorn skip in front of the John Harvard statue. Contrary to popular belief, the rarity of Mass. Hall sightings is not because we are overly studious introverts. Each of our rooms is actually equipped with a secret emergency exit that leads to hidden underground tunnels. Keys to these exits are given only to Mass. Hall residents. The underground tunnels lead to a room that allows us to monitor all student activity in Harvard Yard (think tracking device from The Dark Knight). Thus, you don’t see us, but we see you…GhostsIn a building that’s nearly three centuries old, there’s bound to be a few spirits floating around. In fact, we really enjoy the company. Sometimes a dorm with only twelve other kids gets lonely.Dormcest Cannot Happen...but not just because of how immensely awkward it would be. We really cannot partake in dormcest because we have been trained not to grow emotionally attached to anybody or anything. We are simply incapable of love.TouristsWe really love the sound of tour guides at 8 a.m. shouting incorrect facts about Mass Hall. We also love walking outside in our old sweats in front of 20 strangers staring us down even more.Mass. Hall Students Don’t Throw PartiesIt’s really too inconvenient to throw parties in our single hallway. But, why would we throw parties when our homegirl Faust throws the best ragers anyway? They don’t call her president for no reason!We Have FriendsDespite how close knit our Mass. Hall family is, we do have some social skills that allow us have friends that live outside Mass. Hall. I think.

They're back! Lauren G. Volpert '17 and Olivia A. Nicholls '17 bring you round two of their advice column, The Verdict!After receiving a slew of emails and Instagram direct messages requesting more social media advice, we’ve decided to put together a comprehensive guide to our favorite (Olivia) and second favorite (Lauren) social media platform: Twitter!
For those of you who live under a rock: Twitter is how we communicate our wittiest and deeply personal thoughts and desires to a wide online audience. Everyone uses Twitter—from POTUS to your tech savvy grandmother to that super quiet freshman in the back of your section who is always hunched over his phone. However, having Twitter is one thing, understanding how to correctly master this technological art is quite another. We present to you our official Principles of Twitter.Character LimitTwitter is defined by its 140 character per post limit. You can be FLOTUS, @harrystyles, an eight-year-old with a single follower, @LaurenVolpert, or @olivianicholls3, and you still only have this much space to work with. While it may seem constricting, this limit forces you to play around with words to get your message across. Cue use of #hashtags and Twitpics (more on this later).Another take on Twitter was offered by Ephraim D. Lavey ‘17, “Twitter makes it so that you can communicate to the whole world without really communicating with anyone.” Dark.RatioA Twitter ratio can be hard to kickstart. As we said, literally everyone has Twitter and there are probably hundreds of celebrity or professional accounts you want to follow (a few you should start with: Ellen, Aziz, Miley) with no chance of a follow back. Relax! Twitter ratios do not really matter for us civilians. Focus on the quality of your tweets, not the size of your follower base. However, the number of followers you have should give you an idea about how much you should be tweeting—two followers and 13,000 tweets? You’re doing it wrong.Live TweetingWhen to live tweet and when to not? Live tweeting is for the advanced tweeter. We would advise avoiding this unless you’re REALLY funny… which you may well not be. Successful live tweeting (rare) looks like: this and this and this.HashtagsUnless you’re engaging in a trending tweet movement such as #ThatAwkardMoment (author’s note: we do not encourage this), Twitter hashtags are nominal. They’re important in helping you vary the style of your tweets, but your words matter much more than the hashtag content. As final note to end a witty tweet, we get it. If you have more than three hashtags per tweet, that’s just annoying.To go private or public?While we opt for privacy in our personal Twitters and go public for our professional accounts (how else will we break into the workforce?), some choose to go public for retweeting benefits and as a way to gain more followers. Hannah R. Gropper, a friend of the authors, shares a different perspective: “I realized that I needed to stop hiding behind the veil of protected tweets; the world was ready to read my random thoughts about iced coffee and my insomnia. Plus, then my friends and @trendyproblems could RT my funniest tweets.”TwitpicsQuick quiz about snaps you're tweeting. Should they be...a) photos you want to share with the world but aren’t good enough for Instagram?b) pics that will help you sneak around the 140 character limit and complete your thoughts?c) both of the above?Answer: figure it out on your own, okay?Lauren: “The Twitter-Instagram hybrid, in my opinion, is not really ever appropriate. The 'gram is about the photo and a small caption. Twitter is about the caption with an accompanying photo. In general try to keep these two social media platforms separate.”Olivia: “I often use Twitpics to tweet text conversations. While I don’t quite feel comfortable Instagramming a screenshot, I am always eager to tweet one.”Twitter WarsHilarious. We love Twitter wars. Reading about them, getting into them, and especially winning them. (Disclaimer, we always win).So, time to stop reading and start tweeting. At this point in time, there are no excuses for not having a Twitter. Oh, and some words to those people who have Instagrams and not twitters and are like, “Oh, Twitter just isn’t for me…” If you want to share your crappy over edited pictures with the world (unless you read our previous post in which case you are a pro at the gram), then you should certainly want to share your funny thoughts in the form of tweets. Another bonus: you can join us in shaming others who don’t have Twitter.
 
I wore nice heels and a business blouse; my interviewer wore a flowing skirt and cheap flip flops. I talked about how much I loved rainy weather; she told me she hated it. The interviewee before me brought our interviewer’s book and asked her to sign it, and I didn’t even know that this woman had written a book.
Yet, despite this awkward and tense college interview, I was admitted to Harvard just two months later.
While an interview is ultimately an opportunity for a college to assess a student’s personality beyond his or her written application, students tend to exaggerate the interview’s weight in the scheme of their entire application. In my interview, when things started to go wrong, I thought I had lost my chance at Harvard. My mind jumped to wild conclusions: not only would I not be admitted, I wouldn’t even be considered.
As I and many others learned later, however, the interview didn’t seem to bear much weight on the application as compared to the Common Application essay and personal statements. Besides, we’re only human, right? Mistakes are bound to happen in college interviews--and it’s how you recover from these mistakes that really shows your personality.
John Parsons, a freshman at MIT, recalled his embarrassing interview with an MIT physicist.
“[My interviewer] probably showed up five or seven minutes late, and I had been kind of wondering who my interviewer was the whole time,” he said, adding that he felt very nervous. “I actually asked the wrong guy.”
After John’s interviewer arrived at the coffeeshop where the two met, John wondered if his interviewer would buy the drinks, or if he should.
“I was kind of wondering if he was going to buy me coffee, but he didn’t,” John said. The two headed over to a table, where John’s interviewer sat down his large kettle of tea.
“I put my hand down on the table just after he put the tea on the table. What I didn’t realize was that this was the tipsiest table ever, and this enormous kettle of tea spilled onto my interviewer’s lap,” said John, laughing. “So there’s your first impression.”
John thought he had ruined his chances at MIT. But as it turns out, after John ran around finding napkins and apologized profusely, the two really clicked.
“Since I’m at MIT now, I guess it didn’t matter that much,” John said.
Denis Russu, who was admitted early to Stanford’s class of 2018, said he was also very nervous for his interview, but had already formulated expectations before it actually began.
“Before, I had a very narrow scope of what a Stanford student was like,” Denis said. “I was sort of expecting another really laid back, outdoorsy sort of person.”
Instead, he found himself sitting across from a “sorority girl who majored in business.”
“We had virtually nothing in common,” Denis said.
Because Denis had envisioned his interview going a certain way,he said it did not go as well as he had hoped.
“I was pretty uptight and was really stressed out,” Denis said. “I blew it up in my head.” He added that holding expectations for his interview was a mistake.
Melinda R. Song ’17, a Harvard freshman, agreed that “you never know how your interview is going to go.” Her Harvard interviewer asked her about her future plans, which, Melinda said, was a perfectly normal question.
“I mentioned I’m a little bit interested in science policy and figuring out ways to harness clean energy instead of relying on fossil fuels,” Melinda said. “[My interviewer] looks me straight in the eye and she says, ‘Well you know that I own some coal mines. How does that make you feel?’”
Melinda knew this would be a sticky subject, so she tried to move on with the interview. Her interviewer, however, pressed on.
“She said that she didn’t really understand the recent obsession with clean energy, there are a lot of industries that rely on fossil fuels and it’s a very valid way of using the earth’s resources.’”
Melinda conceded and talked a bit about her interest in clean energy, but moved the conversation along soon after.
“I didn’t want to freeze up, but I had to try to think on my feet and try to think of a way to change topics quickly,” she said.
While Melinda, Denis, and John all experienced embarrassing and awkward college interviews, they were all eventually admitted into their dream colleges.
“Be yourself, try to navigate the situation as best you can,” Melinda said on facing an obstacle during a college interview. “You can’t prepare for everything.”
