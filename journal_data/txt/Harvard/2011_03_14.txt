After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The conclusion to the Harvard men's basketball team's 65-year NCAA tournament drought will have to wait at least another season.
Exactly 24 hours after its dream of an automatic bid to the Big Dance evaporated in the most heart-wrenching of ways Saturday evening, the Crimson gained some more disconcerting news when it found out it hadn't earned an at-large bid to the tournament, either.
Harvard's RPI of 35 was the highest of any team not invited to participate in March Madness.
“We knew the chances were slim [to get in], but we still had hope,” sophomore guard Christian Webster said. “It’s disappointing.”
But there is still basketball left to be played for Harvard (23-6, 12-2 Ivy).
On Sunday evening, the Crimson was offered and accepted a bid to the National Invitation Tournament, along with 31 other teams left out of the Big Dance field.
Harvard was seeded sixth in its region and will travel to Stillwater, Okla., to take on the Oklahoma State Cowboys (19-13, 6-10 Big 12) Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., in a game that will be nationally televised on ESPN.
“We’re really excited,” junior co-captain Oliver McNally said. “It’s going to be a fun experience for us...the NIT is a big deal; we’re going to try to win some games and extend our season.”
Oklahoma State, the third seed in the region, enters the tournament with wins over Alabama, Stanford, then-No. 17 Kansas State, then-No. 15 Missouri, and Baylor on its resume.
Most recently, like the Crimson, the Cowboys are coming off an agonizing one-point loss.  But Oklahoma State’s defeat was to No. 2 Kansas, whom the Cowboys took to the wire in the quarterfinals of the Big 12 tournament on Thursday before falling, 63-62.
Oklahoma State is led by senior forward Marshall Moses, who paced the team with 14.3 points and 7.4 rebounds per game on the season. He will provide a difficult matchup for Crimson junior co-captain Keith Wright, the Ivy League’s Player of the Year, who also led his team in scoring and rebounding.
The Cowboys frontcourt suffered a big loss in February, when junior Darrell Williams, the team’s second-leading rebounder, was suspended after being charged with felony rape. But sophomore forward J.P. Olukemi has since raised his game and adds 11.5 points off the bench.
In the backcourt, Oklahoma State junior point guard Keiton Page chips in 13.5 points and led the team with 23 against the Jayhawks. He will pose a defensive challenge for Harvard sophomore Brandyn Curry, who did a good job defending Princeton’s Dan Mavraides on Saturday.
“They’re a really good basketball school in a power conference,” McNally said.
Oklahoma State was ranked just 330th out of the 346 NCAA Division I teams in assists per game this season. Sophomore guard Ray Penn led the squad with 2.1 per contest.
Containing the Cowboys inside and forcing Oklahoma State into long jumpers and threes could be the key to a victory for the Crimson. The Cowboys only shot 29.7 percent from behind the arc during the regular season–328th in Division I.
Oklahoma State was middle-of-the-pack nationally in overall shooting percentage, while Harvard’s 47.7 percent was 14th-best in the country. The Crimson also ranked second in the nation in free-throw percentage, but went just 10-of-16 from the line against the Tigers.
Cowboys coach Travis Ford said he had seen Harvard’s 16-point win over Colorado while scouting the Buffaloes earlier in the season and came away impressed.
“[The Crimson], from everything we’ve heard, they’ve been a buzz of college basketball the last couple weeks, as far as a team that’s had an incredible year,” Ford told NewsOK.
The game will be the only NIT first round matchup televised on ESPN, and Harvard has never appeared on the network before. Harvard has also never played Oklahoma State in basketball.
“We’re excited to play in the postseason,” Webster said. “I know a lot of people don’t get that chance.”
If Harvard tops the Cowboys, it will take on the winner of Wednesday’s game between Washington State–the two-seed in the region–and Long Beach State, the 11 seed.
The No. 1 seed in the Crimson’s region is Boston College, whom Harvard has defeated in three consecutive years, including a 78-69 win in Chestnut Hill on January 5 of this season.
Crimson coach Tommy Amaker won the NIT with Michigan in 2004. Harvard has a long way to go to get to that point, but McNally and Webster both said they would move on and not let Saturday’s buzzer-beating defeat linger in their minds.
Instead, after being snubbed from the NCAA tournament, the Crimson now feels it has something to prove in the NIT.
“We had a good chance to get the tourney, but we put ourselves in a bad position [by losing],” McNally said. “We’re in the NIT. We’re happy with the chance to keep playing, and obviously that’s where we’re at right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard softball is quickly becoming the Rachel Brown show.
At the UC Riverside tournament that started on Friday to kick off the team’s spring break California road trip, junior Brown clinched all three of Harvard’s victories.
More impressively, Brown has earned the decision in every Crimson (6-3) win so far this year.
Harvard took its first three games against UC Riverside (6-15), North Dakota (4-13), and St. Louis, before falling to the Billikens (14-9) in a rematch in the last game of the tournament.
Brown went 3-0 on the weekend, striking out 29 during two starts and two relief appearances. She walked seven and surrendered only four earned runs.
“I think she was really composed. She had a great rhythm in her routine. She mixed her pitches well, and focused pitch-to-pitch,” Harvard coach Jenny Allard said.
ST. LOUIS 5, HARVARD 3
The Crimson fell into an early hole, and the team was never able to catch up to St. Louis in the second game between the two in as many days.
Junior Julia Moore struggled on the mound and picked up her second loss of the year to move to 0-2. Brown came in after an inning and a third, and despite another strong performance, Harvard couldn’t close the one-run deficit.
“Julia Moore got the start today, and she was really settled in and throwing good pitches,” Allard said. “They just had her timed.”
After surrendering a run in the first, co-captain Ellen Macadam tied the game with a lead-off home run. But Moore was charged with three runs in the top of the second—two of which came around to score after the junior was pulled—and the Billikens were able to hang on.
The Crimson scored twice in the bottom of the same inning but did not plate a runner during the rest of the afternoon, leaving nine stranded on base. A St. Louis insurance run in the top of the seventh all but sealed a Billiken win.
“I think we obviously had a disappointing last game,” Brown said. “I think it’s kind of tough to mentally practice those game situations, so it takes a little bit of time to warm up. I have confidence that we’re going to get there.”
HARVARD 6, NORTH DAKOTA 1
Macadam went 3-for-4 and Brown fanned 11 as Harvard easily coasted past the Fighting Sioux in the third game of the tournament.
The Crimson scored twice in the top of the first—on a sacrifice fly from junior Whitney Shaw and a RBI-groundout from freshman Kasey Lange—to jump to the early lead. Brown was perfect through four and two-thirds, keeping the game out of reach.
“I think we have quite a few players who are in a really good spot right now,” Brown said. “I think overall, our team is really great offensively this year.”
Lange and Shaw each picked up another RBI later in the game, and other than a brief fifth-inning two-out rally, North Dakota mustered little offense on the afternoon.
HARVARD 2, ST. LOUIS 1
After St. Louis scored the tying run in the seventh to even the game at one, sophomore Ashley Heritage hit a walk-off single in the eighth to give Harvard the extra-inning victory.
Brown worked an inning in relief to pick up the win, but freshman Laura Ricciardone threw seven strong innings. She was denied the complete-game shutout with two outs in the bottom of the seventh.
“Laura Ricciardone had a great game on Saturday,” Allard said. “She pitched stellar. She held them until the end of the game, when they strung some hits together…I think that was the best we’ve seen her pitch in the two weekends.”
Kelcie Matesa pitched a complete game for the Billikens but picked up the loss.
HARVARD 7, UC RIVERSIDE 4
Despite Brown’s shakiest performance of the weekend—the pitcher six walks and two earned runs in six innings—the Crimson gave her more than enough offensive support to win the tournament’s first game on Friday.
Harvard scored three runs in the first and took a 7-0 lead going into the bottom of the sixth. UC Riverside managed two runs in each of the last two innings, but the Crimson still easily held onto the win.
Junior Mary Zumbro went 1-for-3 with two RBIs, and Heritage hit 3-for-4 and scored twice.
“We were coming out strong early in the games,” Allard said. “We were being very aggressive and getting key hits and trying to score runs in the first couple of innings.”

Three Harvard divers wrapped up their seasons at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships. The competition took place this weekend at Annapolis, Md.
Sophomore Michael Stanton was the only Crimson diver to make the finals of both the 1-meter and 3-meter diving competitions. In the 1-meter contest, Stanton ended up in 13th place with a final score of 524.10, the best for a Harvard diver.
Stanton was on course to better his placement last year of 11th at last year’s championships when he ended the preliminaries in seventh, but he dropped six places by the end of the finals. In the 3-meter competition, Stanton landed in 16th place with a score of 580.10.
Senior Zac Ranta finished up his Crimson career with 13th place in the 3-meter diving contest, the best result out of the three divers. He ended with a final score of 597.85.
Last year, Ranta did not compete at the NCAA Zone A Diving Championships, but in 2009, he earned an 11th-place finish in the 3-meter contest, the best of his collegiate career. Ranta ended the preliminaries in 24th for the 1-meter competition and did not qualify for the finals.
Finally, freshman Joe Zarrella took 16th place in the finals of the 1-meter diving competition in his first time competing at the event. Zarrella ended with a final score of 512.75. He landed in 22nd for the 3-meter contest in the preliminaries and did not qualify for the finals.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The first two times that the Dartmouth and Harvard men’s hockey teams met up this season, the Big Green dominated, clobbering the Crimson, 8-2 and 5-2.
This time around, Harvard kept things much more interesting, but in the end, the result was the same.
Despite its late-season resurgence, the Crimson couldn’t top No. 18 Dartmouth at Thompson Arena this weekend, falling, 2-1, in a best-of-three series in the ECAC quarterfinals.
Harvard started off strong, beating the Big Green on Friday, 3-2. But then the home team mounted a comeback, winning the following two nights to take the series and advance to the ECAC semifinals.
“We were disappointed in the results, but...as a team, [we] could not be more proud of each other for our effort,” said co-captain forward Michael Del Mauro. “We really played well, [but] the last two games just didn’t go our way…[that’s] the way hockey goes.”
DARTMOUTH 4, HARVARD 3
After an overtime loss on Saturday night, the Crimson rebounded quickly yesterday.
Just seven minutes into the contest, sophomore forward Marshall Everson found junior defenseman Ryan Grimshaw. After Grimshaw skated into Dartmouth’s zone, he took two shots, the second of which deflected right to sophomore forward Alex Fallstrom. Fallstrom beat the goaltender from the slot to put Harvard on top early.
Dartmouth evened the score at one apiece early in the second period, and the score remained knotted at one for the remainder of the frame.
With the start of the series’ final period, the game’s low-scoring nature seemed to vanish.
As Del Mauro came onto the ice early in the third frame, sophomore forward Conor Morrison skated down the right side. As Big Green defenders began to charge Morrison, the sophomore dished the puck off to Del Mauro, who found the back of the net to give the Crimson a short-lived 2-1 lead at the 4:54 mark.
“It was a really great effort by Morrison to keep control of the puck and stay on it,” Del Mauro said. “He made a couple really great moves on the defensemen.”
But then the tide began to turn.
Just over two minutes after Del Mauro put Harvard on top, Dartmouth began a goal-scoring onslaught, tallying three unanswered goals in less than a 10-minute period to give the home team a two-goal advantage.
As the game clock wound down, the Crimson earned a power play and pulled Carroll, giving the visitors a 6-on-4 advantage with two minutes left.
Harvard capitalized on the opportunity. With 20 seconds to play, sophomore defenseman Danny Biega found Fallstrom from the point. For the second time of the night, Fallstrom beat the Big Green goaltender, halving Dartmouth’s lead.
“If [Fallstrom] didn’t score that goal on the power play at the end, we wouldn’t have had a chance,” co-captain defenseman Chris Huxley said.
But that’s as close as the Crimson came, losing 4-3. Unable to score again in the remaining time, the buzzer signaled the end of Harvard’s season.
DARTMOUTH 2, HARVARD 1
While Sunday’s contest became an offensive showcase, on Saturday, it was all about the defense.
The Big Green took the lead midway through the first period after Dartmouth forward Adam Estoclet fired a shot from the left circle that found the back of the net. The Big Green retained the lead for the next 38 minutes.
The Crimson tied it up 11:12 into the third period. Huxley’s shot from the point hit the crossbar, and the puck deflected right to senior forward Michael Biega, who hit the equalizer past the Dartmouth netminder.
Regulation failed to settle the game. But just 1:37 into the sudden-death overtime, Big Green forward Andrew Owsiak gave the home team the victory after his shot from the right side of the ice hit a skate, which redirected the puck past Carroll and into the net.
“There was no huge mistake on the overtime goal,” Del Mauro said. “That’s the way you get a lot of goals in overtime...we transitioned very quickly to just proceed to [think], ‘Let’s win the next game.”
“[The goal] was tough because I believe we were the better team throughout the whole game,” Fallstrom added. “It was really unfortunate.”
HARVARD 3, DARTMOUTH 2
Coming into the series, Harvard had been in the midst of a season-long five-game winning streak.
That momentum paid dividends early.
The Crimson drew first blood. Capitalizing on an early Dartmouth power play, junior forward Alex Killorn scored just 5:39 into the contest.
“[Killorn’s goal] was a huge goal because one of the keys to our games was having a great start and really initiating the series with an intensity that caught them off guard,” Del Mauro said.
After the Big Green evened the score 10 minutes later, Harvard quickly regained the lead thanks to a Fallstrom score.
The Crimson added to the lead 21 minutes later. Michael Biega found Del Mauro in the left faceoff circle, and the captain found the back of the net to extend the visitors’ lead to two goals.
“It’s a lot easier [to score] when a guy on your team’s putting the puck on your stick in a dangerous area, and that’s really what happened,” Del Mauro said.
Dartmouth never retied the score. The Big Green scored with 1:26 left in the third period, but the goal proved to be too little too late, as Harvard grabbed a 3-2 victory.
But despite the strong start to the series, Friday’s win proved to be the Crimson’s only one.
“We were planning on coming to the rink the next day and having a repeat [of Friday’s performance],” Del Mauro said. “[The next two games], we did a lot of the same things we did [on Friday]...[but] sometimes your shots just aren’t in the back of the net.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I.
Immediately after Princeton hit the shot the first thing our point guard, Oliver McNally, did was drop to the floor to avoid the Princeton fans coming in from the stands.  He ducked his head down towards them the way you do when a wave is coming at you, or if you’re a ball-carrier playing football and somebody bigger than you is heading your way; but when no one made direct contact with him—he wasn’t the main source of attraction—he fell out of balance to the floor, and then he lay there, and then he got up.
Before their games start the Harvard team forms two lines, for when the starters’ names are called, except one non-starter, a tall skinny boy whose name I can’t recall now.  He stands at the edge of the lines, facing both.  When Kyle Casey’s name, for example, is called, Casey takes a few bouncing steps towards the tall skinny boy and then they bump chests and engage in a quick series of handshakes and parallel motions.  Everyone’s is different, but Kyle Casey’s ends with a salute.  The tall skinny boy gives him the salute back and then folds back into his original position.
There is a Harvard student standing next to me who seems to know everything about the game and the things around it.  That the man in the suit sitting in between the Princeton and Harvard student sections is, for example, ESPN’s own Jeremy Schaap, of the Jeremy Schaap show on ESPN.  “EEEE SSSSS P NNNNN,’” he quotes.  “You know what I’m talking about, right?” He is the one who jinxes the game singlehandedly, by starting to gather his belongings when Harvard is up by one with 2.8 seconds left, when he turns to us and asks on which side we should plan to storm the court.  Later, a girl standing near us will say, “I hate things like that.”

Although we've spent the last week evaluating and ranking Harvard's 12 Houses, we wanted to take a moment to remind freshmen (and upperclassmen alike) that House life quality isn't dictated by any outside ranking, but rather by what you make of your House's advantages and how you work to improve your House's disadvantages.
These rankings have changed over the years, and in the spirit of House ranking mobility, here's a look back at our House rankings over the years. Scroll over a House name to see its rankings over the past three years. Click to see the article from that year.
Note: In 2009, the Houses were not ranked 1 through 12, but rather as such: [ AAA > AA > A > BBB > junk > subprime ]. For purposes of this chart, Houses with the same 2009 rank have been grouped in alphabetical order.

The Harvard's men's basketball team made history earlier this month after winning its first Ivy League championship ever. The team had a chance to clinch a berth to the NCAA tournament last Saturday but lost in heartbreaking fashion to the Princeton Tigers. Now, the team is preparing to play in the National Invitation Tournament.
But outside the gates of Harvard Yard, former Crimson basketball standout, Jeremy Lin '10 is forging ahead on his NBA career and last Thursday was featured on CNN's "American Morning."
Lin, a point guard for the Golden State Warriors, is the first NBA player to have graduated from Harvard in 57 years and also the first Asian-American to play in the NBA in almost 60 years.
During the interview, Lin joked that his teammates make fun of him whenever he doesn't get a question right because of the expectations that come with being a Harvard graduate.
When asked which would look better on his resume in 10 years—his Harvard degree in economics or his stint in the NBA—Lin decided that playing professional basketball would be more impressive, though Lin quickly added that he is very proud of both accomplishments.
Check out the rest of the video to see what else Lin had to say about his time spent with the Golden State Warriors thus far.

About 30 students evacuated Currier House after a fire alarm went off around 1:40 p.m. today. Three Cambridge Fire Department units and one Harvard University Police Department unit responded within minutes.
A steam leak in a mechanical room set off the alarm, according to Cambridge Fire Department Deputy Chief Francis E. Murphy III. The steam pipe, which is part of the heating system, will have to be repaired, Murphy said. The building was cleared for re-entry about 10 minutes later.
