After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As they emerged from the back of the stage at Paine Hall and quietly assumed their places, the Parker Quartet members paused briefly and pensively before beginning their repertoire. Indeed, from the first three notes — a bold, incisive motive from Leoš Janáček’s “String Quartet No. 1” — it was clear that this performance was intent on taking its concert-goers on an incredible journey.
This performance was the inaugural concert of this year’s Blodgett Chamber Music Series at Harvard. The Parker Quartet has been the Music Department’s Blodgett Artists in Residence since 2013. Their program featured four works: the Janáček, Hungarian composer György Kurtág’s “Six Moments Musicaux,” his “Officium Breve in Memoriam Andreæ Szervánsky,” and Claude Debussy’s “String Quartet in G Minor.” Though the repertoire explored a vast mosaic of virtuosity and texture, the four musicians masterfully weaved through it all with their continual, unified dynamism.
This unity was illustrated most explicitly in Janáček’s piece. Based on Leo Tolstoy’s short story “The Kreutzer Sonata,” the work tells a tumultuous tale of desperation, lamentation, and forbidden love. The Parker Quartet evoked these themes right from the opening motive, where two yearning, biting notes played in unison deflect into an impressively restrained dissonance. Indeed, it was their ability to transition between entirely different moods so gracefully — and yet with so much intention — that captured the excellence of their interpretation. Decisive, almost-folksy tunes passed around between the quartet’s members (Daniel Chong, Ken Hamao, Jessica Bodner, and Kee-Hyun Kim) atop still, eerie pedal tones. The dissonance faded almost imperceptibly, away into introspective washes of sound. This mastery of color matches the quartet’s technical prowess. In particular, the execution of ponticello in the third movement — playing on the string instrument’s bridge — was phenomenal, creating a true sense of grit and unease without sacrificing any tone or clarity.
The group displayed these strengths further in Kurtág’s pieces. As they consist exclusively of short movements — there are six in the “Moments Musicaux” and 15 in the “Memoriam” — they pose an additional challenge for structural integrity in performance. Nevertheless, the Parker Quartet deftly managed to present the often-jarringly diverse movements as natural continuations of each other. The polyrhythmic sections, though usually utilizing extreme registers and heightened dissonance, seemed as comfortable and as grounded as the warm, rich chorales that immediately succeeded them. The full-bodied, rigid intentionality of sustained notes in many movements of the “Memoriam” — often held for absurdly long times — was just as clear as that of the few lines played détaché or staccatissimo. Even the most vulnerable notes were imbued with meticulous vitality.
While the Kurtág was, more often than not, delicate and slightly restrained, the Debussy was the opposite: rapturous and sonorous. This rhapsody-like character manifests itself in the quartet’s interpretation right from the very first phrase: The jazz-like melody never fails to embody a novel personality in each iteration, while staying true to its source under the musicians’ able hands. This mastery of call-and-response reflects itself again in the swift, precise syncopations of the second movement and the impossibly sweet phrases of the third. Most impressive of all, perhaps, was the quartet’s ability to build up tension but provide a gratifying ending. The frenetic movement of all the melodic lines at the end of the first movement comes a climactic, but also cathartic, section of cascading unison triplets.
The Parker Quartet’s distinguishing feature is their ability to unite in performance. Not only do they forge bonds between each other through the music they share, but they also join together with their audience, transporting them on a journey through their keen attention to phrasing and character. After all, common intention and collaboration are fundamental to chamber music, and the Parker Quartet exemplifies this most of all.
The Parker Quartet returns to Paine Hall on Friday, Nov. 30 at 8 p.m., featuring works by Beethoven and Shostakovich.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Chicago” holds the record for the longest-running American musical in Broadway history. And this weekend, Harvard students are bringing the musical theater classic to life. Produced by Abigail G. Sage ’21, Eric J. Cheng ’20, and Katherine Hess ’20 of the Harvard College Musical Theater, “Chicago” opens on Oct. 19 at the Loeb Drama Center Mainstage.
The show traces the life of two very different vaudevillian women, Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, who find themselves under similar circumstances having been arrested for murder and are placed in Chicago’s Cook County Jail in the 1920s. For Annabel O’Hagan ’19, who stars as the principal character of Roxie Hart, “Chicago” holds a special place in her heart — it is the musical that she said made her fall in love with theater.
“I played Roxie as a sophomore in high school and she was my introduction into musical theater in a sense where I got a lot more control. It was my first time playing a big lead,” O’Hagan said. “And it’s so much fun because she’s so different from me. She’s so feisty and big and bold all the time, and to be able to inhabit that for a couple of hours on stage is just really freeing.”
O’Hagan calls Roxie a “wannabe,” and said the one word she would use to describe Roxie is “hungry.”
“[Roxie] wants to climb to the top and she’s willing to do anything to get there. She has that star-to-be mentality that when she gets to the top, she can’t get enough of it,” O’Hagan said.
Ashley M. Lalonde ’20 will star opposite O’Hagan in Roxie’s counterpart and competition, Velma Kelly.
“Velma Kelly is a super sexy old-time star of Vaudeville, so she’s kind of the epitome of a super star in the 1920s,” Lalonde said. “She’s a little bit older and she knows who she is, but she gets into a lot of trouble.”
Director Ruan Kapur '20, who said his background is primarily in dance, said this was an ideal first show for him to direct because of the heavy role that dance plays in the musical. The show only features Kapur’s choreography, though he said it was heavily influenced by Bob Fosse, especially in iconic numbers such as “All That Jazz,” “Me and My Baby,” and “Razzle Dazzle.”
“[Fosse]’s choreography is kind of infused in a few places,” Kapur said. “The whole thing is definitely inspired by him, and every so often, there’s his exact touches in there.”
Other than the choreography, Harvard College Musical Theater preserved the essence of many other aspects of “Chicago.” Jennifer Kunes ’19, who serves as stage manager of the production, said the costumes and sets were designed with the original production in mind. Although Kapur said he stayed mostly true to the original show, he made one key casting difference — instead of casting a man in drag for the role of Mary Sunshine, Kapur cast a woman. Mary Sunshine, the reporter for both Roxie and Velma’s trials, is usually seen as a “big joke,” according to Kapur. Her introductory number in the first act, “A Little Bit of Good,” alludes to the nature of Mary Sunshine’s character — positive, hopeful, and trying to see the best part of everyone.
“The way it’s framed in the production is that the characters decide that she’s going to be easy to manipulate because she believes in the good in people,” Kapur said. “So instead of making that something that’s very inauthentic, I wanted to see what it would be like if we actually had a woman portray that role in a more authentic way upfront, so that the audience is seeing this character — that other people are saying is dumb and easy to manipulate — but the character is being authentic about the fact that she tries to see the good in everybody.”
Kapur said he hopes the audience will consider her position as a character more seriously.
“Why are we making fun of this character, when really this is how it should be?” Kapur said, referring to how Mary Sunshine sees the “little bit of good” in everybody. “You know, maybe she’s not getting it wrong.”
With less than a month between casting announcements and the first show, O’Hagan said the rehearsal process has been a “whirlwind.” Despite the tight schedule, O’Hagan said she found the classical musical theater aspect of “Chicago” made it relatively easy to pick up. Kapur and Kunes also both said the timeline has been a challenge.
“Chicago” will run this and next weekend: Oct. 19 and Oct. 20 at 7:30 p.m., Oct. 21 at 2:00 p.m., Oct. 26 at 7:30 p.m., and Oct. 27 at 2:00 pm.

On Oct.13, the Harvard Ceramics Studio in Allston hosted an opening reception and public demonstration for their newest exhibition, “Raise a Glass: A Contemporary Response to Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World.” The exhibition is inspired by a current exhibition at the Harvard Art Museums, “Animal-Shaped Vessels from the Ancient World: Feasting with Gods, Heroes, and Kings,” which offers a collection of various vessels shaped as animals — both real and imagined — that were once used as drinking horns and pitchers. The Harvard Ceramic Program takes a contemporary spin on the collection of ancient vessels.
Kathy King, Director of Education at the Ceramics Program, curated this exhibit, amassing a grouping of work from 15 different artists for “Raise a Glass.” She said she asked these artists to create their own interpretation of vessels inspired by the ancient ones currently on view at The Harvard Art Museums.
“I wanted to find artists that I knew either had worked with animal imagery in some way, or for whom it would be really interesting to give this kind of assignment,” King said.
The artists displayed at the Ceramics Studio are chosen from contemporary sculptors and vessel makers from around the world. Except for one piece made of silver, all of the works are made of clay or at least have some clay component. Other than this commonality in material, each artist found their own unique interpretation of the ancient vessels and produced pieces that are vastly different from one another. One artist, Salvador Jimenez-Flores, constructed a contemporary piece with various media boldly mounted on the wall. A ceramic drinking vessel sits in the middle of a piece of animal hide hanging from the wall. The words “WE ARE NOT ANIMALS” are etched through the hide in block lettering, and bright gold tassels hang below.
By contrast, artist Mia Riley created a work titled “Wolf Spirit Rhyton” that is reminiscent of traditional East Asian art. A wolf’s head opens up into a drinking vessel. The piece is coated in a celadon-like glaze and decorated with delicate carvings. Not only is this piece a nod to her Asian heritage, the animals she chose are very relevant to her upbringing in Canada.
“The wolf and the bison are two animals that have a lot of cultural presence where I’m from,” she said. Because Riley said there is not a lot of indigenous pottery where she is from in Alberta, Canada, she uses the concept of the animal head to realize what “a more spiritual piece of pottery might look like... because we don’t necessarily have that legacy of traditional terracotta.”
Around five or six of the contributing artists attended the opening reception and three artists even said a few words about their pieces and process during the opening reception gallery talk. In addition to hearing about process, the reception offered attendees the opportunity to physically interact with the process by producing their own animal shaped vessel. Tables were set up with small molds and terracotta clay. Guided by a few ceramicists, the public could experiment with making their very own piece.
The “Raise a Glass” exhibition is not only inspired by the exhibition at the Harvard Art Museums. It also exists in conversation with the “Animal-shaped Vessels” exhibit. The curator of the Animal Shaped Vessels exhibit Susanne Ebbinghaus spoke about how the exhibition centers around different cultures interpretation of vessels.
“It’s fabulous to see yet another re-interpretation to that idea,” Ebbinghaus said. “Seeing the creative responses to the ancient vessels makes me see the ancient vessels with different eyes.”
King also spoke about the two exhibitions in relation to one another. Over the one and a half years spent working on the exhibition, she had not seen the ancient vessels now on view at the Museum in person. After working on this upcoming exhibition and staring at images of the vessels for such a long time, King said she started crying when she first went into the show.
When King recruited these artists, she said she put very few limits on what they could or could not produce. As a result, the exhibition displays a diverse range of styles and mediums. Linked through a shared inspiration, the “Raise a Glass” exhibition shares different stories, backgrounds, and interpretations. The opening reception is a particular highlight of this exhibit, given the interactive component. As King said: “It’s a great mix to get people to get beyond the austere museum setting and really experience the work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Splitting up across the Ivy League, both of Harvard’s men and women’s tennis teams will be competing this weekend. The men’s team will be on the road for the Big Green Invite hosted by Dartmouth, and the women’s team will be playing at home, hosting the Harvard Fall Scramble.
After coming off of a very successful weekend in ITA regionals, the men’s team will look to continue this trend in this weekend’s tournament against Dartmouth, Buffalo, Brown, Yale, and Boston University. Senior Samuel Beren, senior Michael Peters, sophomore Constantine Zoske, and freshman Harris Walker will be traveling for the Crimson and will participate in both singles and doubles play.
“I think that it should be a good opportunity for...some of the guys who didn’t go to regionals to get in some match time and get some good competition experience against the other strong players in our region,” said senior captain Andy Zhou, who made it to the semifinal round in the ITA tournament the previous weekend. “We definitely need some of these matches under our belt, because it’s all good preparation for the spring season.”
The players attending are looking forward to playing some real matches against great competition.
“It’s always fun to play other Ivy League schools, but...it’s especially fun getting to see Ivy leagues and non-conference competition as well,” said Beren.
“It’s good to get some real competition, because we’ve been practicing the past couple of weeks,” said Beren. “We haven’t had a ton of matches this month, so we’re excited to get out there and just see what we’ve been working on and see how it’s doing.”
The team has been working on staying mentally tough and fighting for every point. For Beren, the key for another successful is to “trust what we’ve been training on for the past month, and just stay focused and give it a good effort.”
Harvard’s women’s team will also be seeing strong competition this weekend as they host Seton Hall, Rhode Island, and Fordham for a round-robin style tournament. Last year, the Crimson hosted Seton Hall, Rhode Island, and Middlebury, and saw victories against each school. This offseason, they have participated in three tournaments at Dartmouth, Columbia, and Yale. This tournament will be a good opportunity for the team to see some non-conference competition.
Just like the men’s, the team is coming off a great weekend at ITA Regionals, in which junior Jenna Friedel, junior Irene Lu, junior Natasha Gonzalez, and freshman Rachel Lim competed. The team is particularly excited for this weekend, however, because it is the first tournament where the whole team is going to be together.
“I think it will be a good test of what we’ve been doing in practice and what is to come for the season next semester,” said senior captain Erica Oosterhout.
Oosterhout is playing in the first tournament since her incredible performance at the ITA All-American Championship. She made it to the last round before losing in a tight match to No. 40 Petra Granic of the University of Texas. She went the furthest for any Ivy League Member.
The team has been focusing on playing real points to get ready for the weekend. The past couple of practices have been centered around staying mentally tough and maintaining a match mindset. Doubles play will be a main focus for this weekend as there will be particularly strong doubles competition.
Oosterhout is excited for the opportunity to see the entire team encouraging one another in real match play for the first time. For her, this weekend is really about ensuring a strong bond between teammates.
“The most important part is to stay cohesive as a team,” she mentioned. “Just making sure we’re cheering for each other as loudly as possible and having everybody be engaged.”
Both teams are experiencing productive and successful offseasons and are looking forward to the continuation of tough competition in the coming days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Glancing up above the concrete bleachers of Harvard Stadium at the conclusion of the third quarter, one might have thought that the scoreboard was not displaying the Harvard–Princeton game. Tigers 10, Crimson 7 was the tally at the end of three. For a team that had averaged 52 points over its first five contests, Princeton was struggling mightily and Harvard was within striking distance in a crucial Ivy League battle.
That all changed in the fourth quarter, as the contest quickly devolved into a gunslinging battle between the pair of offenses.
With 48 seconds remaining in the game, the Crimson pulled within eight points courtesy of a toe-tap touchdown to Tyler Adams in the back right corner of the end zone. With two timeouts remaining — not enough to prevent Princeton from wasting the rest of the clock — Harvard sent out its onside kicking unit for the second time of the quarter.
The kick from Jonah Lipel bounded twice but fell right into the waiting arms of a Tigers special teamer. Just like that, Harvard’s longshot bid to forge a comeback was all for naught.
With three knees to run the clock down, Princeton solidified a tight 29-21 decision. Despite the loss, the Crimson (3-3, 1-2 Ivy) played the Tigers (6-0, 3-0) better than any of their prior opponents had to this point. Princeton’s 29 points represented far less than its previous low of 45 against Columbia, and Harvard’s 22 marked the first time any opponent had posted more than 10 against the visitors.
“You take away the late score and I’m not sure we could’ve played any better defensively,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “I use the word heroically. That’s how well we played. That’s how hard we played.”
Before the Adams touchdown, there was a near identical situation to allow the Crimson to cut the Tigers’ lead to 22-14. Bolstered by a favorable pass interference call on a fourth and 10 chance, senior quarterback Tom Stewart ultimately aired out a deep pass to senior receiver Henry Taylor, who corralled the ball, tapped his heel, and fell backwards out of the end zone.
 Along with that pass interference, Princeton accumulated seven total penalties after recording just 14 in its first five games.
“At the end of the day, we’ve got to be more disciplined and that’s something we preach,” Princeton coach Bob Surace said. “Those things against a team that’s as disciplined and as good as Harvard, that’s the recipe for a tough day.”
Harvard’s hopes were quickly dashed following the Taylor touchdown as well. An onside kick attempt from Lipel failed to regift possession to his offense. Two plays later, running back Charlie Volker exploded for a 49-yard score to put the Tigers up by 15.
A penalty against the home team at the outset of the final frame proved costly. Princeton opted to keep its offense on the field on fourth and four. Quarterback John Lovett targeted receiver Stephen Carlson, who missed the pass but got wrapped up with defensive back Bennett Bay near the goal line. Pass interference, first down.
Lovett capitalized on the mistake, as he let loose a bullet toward the end zone. Jesper Horsted, cutting right to left, funnelled the pass into his hands and fell to the ground for the touchdown. After a blocked point-after attempt, the Tigers extended their lead to 16-7.
On the Crimson’s next drive, Princeton jumped all over a reeling Harvard team. Stewart found Taylor for a short completion on their own end of the field, but defensive back TJ Floyd pried the ball from the wideout’s grasp, and defensive tackle Jake Strain smothered the ball to give the Tigers possession at their opponent’s 29. However, the Crimson halted the visitors’ progress by driving it back eight yards and forcing a punt.
Taylor’s turnover did not lead directly to points, but it was one of two on the day for the senior wideout, and the first one was much more influential. On a long drive that started at the endpoint of the first quarter, the Crimson marched down to the Tigers’ 23. Looking to erase the zero on its end of the scoreboard, Harvard opted for a double reverse pass. Taylor fired to Jack Cook at the goal line, but his pass sailed into double coverage and Floyd came down with the jump ball. Instead of seven points for the home team, the visitors marched downfield to tack on three.
The third quarter took on a completely different character from the 19-14 fourth. Neither team advanced into the red zone throughout the stanza, and the defenses have completely outshined the offensive units. On its first two drives of the third, the Princeton offense gained 13 combined yards. The second series was punctuated by a sack from Crimson defensive end Scott Garrison for a loss of nine.
On Harvard’s first offensive chance of the period, the Tigers’ defense responded and quieted the home crowd. Two snaps of the three and out resulted in Stewart collapsing to the ground on sacks. By the end of the third quarter, the teams combined for six punts on six drives. Princeton narrowly won the game’s sack battle, 4-3.
Crucial to the Crimson’s limiting of the Tigers to just 10 points through three quarters was its third-down defense. Coming into the tilt, Princeton’s offense ranked third in the nation in third-down percentage (53 percent). It succeeded on just five of 18 third-down tries.
“Their safeties were coming up and when we had the box blocked, the safeties came up and they were tackling us for four yard gains,” Surace said. “Third downs in particular there were some fights. It was a matter of inches on both sides.”
Two consecutive plays early in the second quarter summarized the usually electrifying Princeton offense. On the first snap, Horsted appeared to have dropped a pass, but reached out with his left hand as he was hit to salvage the completion. The next play, Lovett faced pressure and bobbled the ball. Rather than play it safe, Lovett pulled the ball up from between his legs and fired a long bomb to Horsted, who made a leaping two-handed catch.
Unsurprisingly, Horsted was Lovett’s favorite target. The senior tandem connected for 126 yards in the air. In this game, Lovett — wearing a large cast on his left arm — relied more on his arm than on his feet, as he carried the ball just 45 yards, his season low.
“We were just aware he could tuck it and run at any time, so we made sure we stayed and played assignment and sound football so that when it came time and he tucked it and ran, we had someone in position to make a play,” captain Zach Miller said.
Despite the theatrics, the Crimson’s defense held strong and curtailed the visitors’ momentum, limiting the Tigers to three points on that possession. After 30 minutes of play, Princeton’s 10 points marked its lowest first-half output all season. In fact, the Tigers scored more than 10 points in the second quarter alone in each of their first five games. Strong stands by the defensive line were especially useful — defensive tackle Stone Hart tackled Lovett twice for losses.
Later in the second quarter, a read option delivered for the home side. Harvard marched down to the Tigers’ five yard line on the strength of completions to Adam Scott and runs by Aaron Shampklin. On first and goal, Shampklin received a wildcat snap, fooled nearly everyone in the stadium with a fake handoff to B.J. Watson, and took the ball himself for the score. The Crimson pulled within a field goal, and it managed to maintain that deficit heading into the locker room.
On Princeton’s first drive of the game, it appeared as though Harvard had a chance to stop the Tigers’ potent offense early on. The first two plays saw Lovett brought down behind the line of scrimmage and then throw an incompletion. However, Lovett regrouped for two consecutive first downs, and ultimately the dual threat signal caller took the ball 33 yards on fourth-and-one for a touchdown to open the scoring.
Stewart struggled in the first 30 minutes of play, facing immense pressure from the opposing defensive line. He finished the half 4-for-12 for 42 yards, but a number of completions to Scott (34 yards) set up Harvard’s first touchdown. Stewart regrouped in the second half, finishing 19-of-35 for 223 yards and two touchdowns. The senior field general spread out his targets, as each of Adams, Scott, and Taylor finished with over 40 yards in the air.
“You wonder if we should play two minute offense all the time,” Murphy said. “Very impressed with [Stewart’s] composure and his ability to throw the deep ball…. I think the bottom line is they were playing a lot of prevent defense, and we took advantage of that and we got behind them a couple times.”
The backfield carried the offensive attack until the fourth quarter. By the end of the game, Shampklin had racked up 123 yards.
