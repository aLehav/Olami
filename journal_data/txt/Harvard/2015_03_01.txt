After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Up seven with just under two minutes to go, the Cornell basketball team committed the cardinal sin: fouling a three-point shooter.
In this case it was sophomore Corbin Miller, who strode to the line looking to cut the deficit to two possessions. Harvard had trailed throughout the second half, but had held the Big Red to under 30 percent shooting from the field. The Crimson, who had won five of six games decided by five or less points this season, had been here before.
The first free throw clanged off the iron. The gym got louder. Miller took a deep breath but missed the second. And then the third.
Cornell (13-14, 5-6 Ivy) ended the comeback hopes with a jumper on the next possession, coasting to a 57-49 lead that knocked Harvard (19-6, 9-2) out of sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.
“I mentioned to our guys that we didn’t earn it, we didn’t deserve it,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said after his team shot 25 percent and forced only seven turnovers.
FAILING TO CONVERT
Miller’s trip to the charity stripe was emblematic of the Crimson’s struggles as a team. Part was poor luck: a free throw shooter of Miller’s quality—the sophomore had been shooting over 80 percent coming in—misses three free throws less than one percent of the time.
Yet part was standard. Harvard shot just 14 of 23 from the line, good for 61 percent. The Crimson only shoot 71 percent as a team, however, and the best shooter was senior forward Jonah Travis, who sunk both of his free throws on the night.
“It just kills you in a game like this when both teams are struggling to put in the basket,” Amaker said. “We didn’t make enough of our [free throws] and that’s one of the stat lines that become critical when you’re not shooting well from the floor.”
On the other side, the Big Red made 20 of its 21 attempts from the charity stripe. Cornell’s Shonn Miller and Devin Cherry, who combined for 39 of the team’s 57 points on the night, made all 14 of their attempts.
“When they got fouled and got to the line, [the makes] added up,” Amaker said. “It gives your defense energy that you scored points on that possession.”
SYMPTOMATIC SHOOTING
On the night, no Harvard player shot better than 33 percent from the field. No player had it tougher than Saunders, who missed 15 of his 21 shots and five of seven threes—including one that would have tied the game at 42 late in the second half.
After the game, Saunders shrugged off the statistics.
“Coach encouraged me to shoot the ball more,” he said. “It was just off tonight.”
It was an uncharacteristic performance but a typical response. When the team struggled to make its threes earlier in the year, Saunders remarked after a win against FAU that “shooting is the kind of thing where you can’t really control it, there are going to be days where everything goes in and days where nothing goes in.”
A worse sign for the Crimson than how Saunders shot was how much he shot. Although Harvard has won four of seven games where Saunders shoots worse than 35 percent, it has won just one of the four when he has taken 18 or more shots.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
NEW YORK—Corbin Miller for three. Columbia timeout. Corbin Miller for three. Corbin Miller for three. Corbin Miller for tw—actually make that three as well.
Twelve points in under three minutes. A six-point lead transformed into a 15-point gulf. Senior wing Wesley Saunders yelling. Redemption.
Miller’s outburst during the Harvard men’s basketball team’s 80-70 win over Columbia Saturday night was a total departure from his three-point performance the night before.
Of course, Miller was not the only player who let the Crimson (20-6, 10-2 Ivy) down during a 57-49 loss at Cornell Friday. His three straight missed free throws with 1:47 left in the game certainly hurt (especially coming from somebody shooting 88 percent from the line going in). But Saunders shot just six-of-21 in the loss. Co-captains Steve Moundou-Missi and Siyani Chambers combined to shoot 32 percent. The team as a whole made just 25 percent of its shots in that game, costing the Crimson sole possession of first place in the Ivy League.
And Miller was not the only one to bounce back Saturday. They all did. Saunders tallied a team-high 21 points. Moundou-Missi tallied 17 points and 11 rebounds. Chambers had six assists compared to two turnovers. The team combined to shoot a season-high 59 percent from the field in a game it never trailed.
But it was Miller’s misses at the free throw line Friday that Harvard coach Tommy Amaker called indicative of the team’s performance in the loss, and it was his solar fusion of a hot streak Saturday that represented a Crimson team clicking again offensively at just the right time.
“He’s strong-willed and he’s a hooper,” Saunders said of Miller. “He is a shooter and he has that mindset that if he has an off night like that, he’s going to come back the next night and lock in.”
Harvard had started Saturday’s game hot, jumping out a 6-0 lead and turning that into a 13-point advantage at halftime. But then the Crimson scoring stopped. It put up just eight points in eight minutes. It went five minutes without making a field goal. It held onto a lead—one that slowly shrunk from 14 to nine to six to four points—thanks only to Saunders ability to get to the line and knock down a few free throws.
On the other end, the Ivy League’s top scorer was bringing a full Lions (13-13, 6-7 Ivy) crowd to its feet. Maodo Lo finished with 33 points, despite being guarded by Saunders, one of the conference’s best defenders. Lo cut the deficit to six with 11 minutes to play on a driving lay-in, instigating yet another roar from the fans.
The Crimson had seen this story unfold before, losing a 17-point lead to these same Lions two weeks ago before making a shot in the final seconds to escape with a win.
But this time would be different. Miller made sure of it. Thirty seconds after Lo’s layup, the Harvard guard knocked down a jumper for his first points of the game.
A possession later, Miller started a streak of three straight trips down the floor with a made three-pointer, despite two intervening timeouts. The Lions had gone into a zone defense to combat Harvard’s size, and Miller made them pay.
“He changes [the game], especially if you are silly enough to stay in zone,” Columbia coach Kyle Smith said.
Determined not to let Miller make another three, Lion senior Noah Springwater ran out towards the shooter when he got the ball on the next possession. Miller responded by taking a couple steps in and to his left before rising up. Springwater, trying to get back in position, nailed Miller on the arm, nearly knocking the ball out of his hands. But Miller held on, and realizing he had been fouled, threw up a shot to earn free throws. The shot went in. Miller then stepped to the free throw line, where he missed more attempts in one trip on Friday than he had missed all season before that, and knocked down the exclamation point.
“I think he’s a game-changer for us,” Amaker said. “We’ve seen that before in how streaky he can become and obviously it was very much needed.”
While Miller was taking the game over on one end, Harvard’s defense began pressuring Columbia in the backcourt, causing a five-second violation, forcing a timeout, and generally throwing Lo and the Lions out of their rhythm.
Lo still finished with as many points as any Crimson player has scored in a game this season, but it would not be enough. Harvard, thanks to Miller, cleared its last hurdle before a season-altering game Friday when Ivy League co-leader Yale comes to Cambridge in the penultimate game for both teams.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: March 1, 2015, at 1:59 a.m.
Everything went right for the Harvard men’s ice hockey team within the confines of the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Saturday.
In a 5-0 drubbing of Princeton (4-21-3, 2-18-2 ECAC) on Senior Night, fourth-year goaltender Steve Michalek delivered a shutout, junior forward Jimmy Vesey clinched the conference scoring crown, third-line sophomore Tyler Moy struck twice, and even fourth-line sophomore Devin Tringale put one in.
Yet in other ECAC Hockey rinks across New England, things did not go so well for Harvard (15-11-3, 11-8-3), which will skate next weekend as the sixth seed in the conference tournament in a best-of-three matchup against Brown.
The Crimson entered the final day of the regular season looking for help around the conference.  Losses or ties from Colgate and Dartmouth would have provided an opening for Harvard to clinch a first round bye with a win over the Tigers.
Less than an hour before puck drop, Colgate earned the final bye seed with a 4-2 win at Brown. During Harvard’s game, Dartmouth beat Quinnipiac, 3-1, to lock up the fifth seed.
After compiling ECAC Hockey’s best record to start the season, the Crimson will now confront the consequences of a second-half slide.
“We didn’t necessarily get a ton of help around the league,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But I think that in a lot of ways, we’re a very young team and we’re excited to play next weekend, excited to be home.”
Donato and his team will have home playoff games for the first time since 2012, but the Crimson will need to reset after a difficult February. Saturday night’s effort could help the Crimson do just that.
Junior co-captain Kyle Criscuolo started the scoring on the game’s first power play with a knuckling wrist shot that found the far post at 6:49 in the first. Moy followed with two goals—one at 9:05 on a wrap-around backhander and one at 17:15 off a neutral zone turnover.
“Today I think our team was looking to refocus here in the last game of the regular season,” Moy said. “It was a good effort all around.”
The Tigers, who finish last in the conference standings for the second straight season, struggled to mount any real offensive push yet held Harvard scoreless in the second period. The Crimson’s second line, bolstered with the new addition of junior Colin Blackwell at right wing, hit the iron a couple of times but did not convert.
In the final frame, Vesey scored a shorthanded goal in the slot off a Criscuolo feed at 15:22. With a goal and an assist on the night, Vesey became the first Harvard player to capture both the conference goal and conference point scoring titles since Peter Ciavaglia ’91 in 1991.
“I think Jimmy has made a huge step as a player and a leader,” Donato said. “I’m happy to see him get the scoring title and get the goals title, and I am happy because I know he went about it in a very unselfish way.”
Vesey finishes the regular season with 22 goals and 44 points, 18 and 34 of which came in conference games.
Tringale extended Harvard’s lead to five with less than 2:30 left to play, picking up a rebound from senior linemate Mike Seward. It was the first goal of the season for the sophomore, who has played in every game this year, and the first point for Seward.
After skating on the fourth line on Friday, Blackwell saw more ice time on Saturday on the second line and penalty kill. Before this weekend, the San Jose Sharks draft pick had only played a game in November this season and had missed all of the 2013-2014 season with a chronic upper body injury.
“We’re all big Blackwell fans,” Moy said. “All the team is really happy to have him back and see him competing on the ice. He had a few big hits today, and it’s nice to see him mix it up.”
Blackwell has at least one semester of eligibility left yet was among Harvard’s seven players recognized in Senior Night festivities following the game. Michalek, co-captain defenseman Max Everson, and injured defenseman Patrick McNally were also recognized despite the chance that they might see NCAA ice beyond this year.
While Phinney struggled in net, Michalek stopped 27 pucks to pick up his third shutout of the year and first since Nov. 18.
“The guys were talking about [the shutout] on the bench in the last five minutes,” Donato said. “They were really battling and wanted to get the shutout for him. I think it was a fitting ending to the season.”
CORRECTION: March 1, 2015
An earlier version of this article misstated that Harvard honored six players after the game. In fact, the team honored seven. In addition, the earlier version stated that Seward was a walk-on. In fact, Seward was a recruited player.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s volleyball team entered this weekend with a three-match winning streak and a hold on second place in the EIVA. Despite dispatching St. Francis in straight sets on Saturday, the run of recent success came to a jolting halt on Sunday with a 3-1 defeat against league-leading Penn State at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“I feel really good [about] where we are,” Crimson coach Brian Baise said. “I think it’s one of the hardest-working teams we’ve had in quite some time, and that makes a difference.”
PENN STATE 3, HARVARD 1
For 11 points in the fourth set of Harvard’s home contest against the Nittany Lions (6-9, 4-0 EIVA), a volleyball match became a game of tug-of-war.
Between a 17-17 deadlock and a 23-22 Penn State lead, the two teams traded every point, maintaining the suspense of whether the Crimson (9-5, 3-2) could force a fifth set.
But it was the visitors who gave the decisive tug. By stringing together three consecutive kills, the Nittany Lions grabbed the match and remained unbeaten in EIVA play.
“We need to improve our passing and our right-side defense,” White said. “Overall, we played pretty well, but they’re definitely a special team.”
Harvard had to battle back even to reach this contested stalemate, as the Crimson erased a 12-7 advantage before finally capitulating.
White notched 14 finishes on a .444 hitting percentage, but even this outburst could not match the visitors’ senior outside hitter Nick Goodell, who ended with 25 kills.
“He kept beating us crosscourt, so we moved one of our defenders over there,” Baise said. “Like any great player, he started hitting it where our guys weren’t.”
Goodell racked up four kills in the second set as the hosts used a 10-2 stretch to claim a 25-14 set win. Despite going down 14-9 in the third game, Penn State surged back to beat Harvard 25-23 thanks to another five finishes from Goodell.
In the first frame, however, neither Goodell nor a controversial point reversal could prevent the Crimson from widening a 21-19 lead into a 25-21 set win.
“We weren’t as sharp as we had been in the last couple of weeks, although we fought hard,” Baise said. “I thought there were two pretty equal teams out there.”
HARVARD 3, ST. FRANCIS 0
Ten kills, zero errors. That’s how the stat sheet read after one set of play against the Red Flash (2-13, 1-2).
The barrage of attacking did not let up, and Harvard cruised to an overall .525 hitting efficiency and a 3-0 home victory in the first match of the weekend.
‘We came out hard and fast,” Zimmick said. “It’s reinforcing to play well and then be loud. And then when you’re loud and happy and up, you’re playing well.”
The Crimson faced exactly two deficits, a pair of 2-1 holes at the starts of the first and third sets. In both cases, Harvard responded with multi-point runs that tabled any thoughts of close competition.
Junior outside hitter Branden Clemens finished with a double-double, and Zimmick topped all players with four blocks.
During the contest, the Crimson put together three separate 5-0 runs, including a pair in the third set that helped Harvard finish the match with a 12-point lead, its largest of the night.
The Crimson opened the second set with similar intensity, earning six of the first seven points. St. Francis didn’t come much closer as Harvard earned a 25-15 set win.
Serving was a major reason for this success. The Crimson committed eight service errors but also racked up seven aces, an indication of increased serving aggression.
Two of Harvard’s aces came in the first frame, when the Crimson hit to a .625 killing percentage while limiting the Red Flash to a .037 mark.
“It’s been a couple of weeks now where both in practice and in play, we’ve just been really sharp,” Baise said. “That’s the game we like to play.”

The week after Datamatch results came out, I was late to our Flyby writers’ meeting (unsurprising). When I walked in, a Flyby writer asked, “Chris, you’re going to ask out your Datamatches, right?” To which I responded, “Yeah, of course.” Fast forward a few days, and I’ve sent out an extremely awkward email from my Crimson email address (because who wouldn’t put up with me for journalism?) reminding my top match that she was “numerically likely to enjoy” a conversation with me. In our fourth date in Flyby’s Datamatch series, I met my Datamatch this past Wednesday at Cafe Pamplona at 1:30 p.m. (I have a 2:00 class, so I can’t come across as too much of an idiot). Like a weirdo (click on that link, I promise that it’s worth it), I ordered iced coffee in the middle of February. Thus began a conversation between two top Datamatches.
Safe to say, I doubt that an algorithm exists. Don’t get me wrong, I actually really enjoyed our conversation. My Datamatch was a really fun person to talk to and a pleasant young lady (that’s the most elderly thing I’ve ever said). But we had nothing in common– at least not in the traditional college-conversation sense of the word. I concentrate in English; she concentrates in CS. I write sarcastic articles for an (awesome) blog and PAF; she does mock trial. We don’t hang out with the same group of people. We’ve never taken a class together.


But, like I said, we actually had an enjoyable conversation. So there are two possible theories to explain this:
1) Datamatch is actually a perfected form of A&I and once we sign up for Datamatch, our computer starts to learn about us and matches us up based on information that we don’t even know that it knows. 2) Datamatch pairs people randomly (or based on cursory information like year, concentration, etc.) and expects adult human beings to, you know, be able to talk to each other. I know it’s wild to think of Harvard students as socially viable individuals (and, for anyone who knows me/has ever read one of my articles, even harder still to think of me that way), but maybe Datamatch is just hedging their bets and assuming that two people who sit down together will find something to talk about.
So, Harvard College female who had coffee with me, I hope you didn’t hate our conversation (hahah, how much of an idiot would I be if I wrote an article basically saying, “Yeah, two people can just sit down and get along” while my Datamatch just sits there thinking, “Wow, that kid was a weenie.”). So if you’re worried about reaching out to your Datamatches, just do it. Go grab a meal in a dining hall or something (#freewaffles are over unfortunately) and see if you get along. Even if you don’t have anything in common, you’ll probably enjoy it (@MyOtherDatamatches: hear that?).
