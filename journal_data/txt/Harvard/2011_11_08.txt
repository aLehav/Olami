With Christmas approaching, it would seem fitting that John Cho and Kal Penn reprise their roles as Harold and Kumar to inject a little holiday irreverence into the season with their third cinematic installment, “A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas.” Yet, while the film’s elements of farce, dramatic irony, and conventional stereotypes should set the stage for an entertaining satire, “A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas” feels more like a disappointing Christmas present as it is unwrapped. Funny jokes are few and far between, with some crossing the line from comedy into sheer crassness.
At movie’s outset, Harold and Kumar are leading separate lives with new friends in new circumstances. Harold has gone on to become an investment banker on Wall Street. He is living in a comfortable suburban home after having left his pot-smoking days behind as he and his wife try to have a baby. Kumar, meanwhile, is still a bachelor, and has suddenly been thrown a curveball by his ex-girlfriend: he’s going to be a father. A mysterious package for Harold is dropped off at Kumar’s apartment and reunites the two friends once more. The present, high-quality pot, quickly leads to the unfortunate accidental incineration of Harold’s father-in-law’s precious homegrown Christmas tree. Rather than incurring his father-in-law’s wrath, Harold decides to embark on an adventurous journey with Kumar to find a replacement.
The film compensates somewhat for its rather one-dimensional plot and characters with its literally three-dimensional visuals. Be prepared for artificial weed smoke being puffed into your face, occasional eggs being thrown in the audience’s general direction, and various unmentionables on full display. Yet this visceral imagery does little to enhance the comedy and comes across as unnecessary and even hackneyed. Harold’s office assistant’s remark that a cutting-edge 3D television set would make “Avatar look avatarded” leaves a distinct feeling that the joke is really on this movie.
“A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas” incorporates all the stereotypical elements of a stoner comedy, albeit with slight twists in keeping with its holiday theme. Thus, the film features a Santa Claus as a weed dealer and a baby high on crack who lights up with said Santa. Similarly, there is the standard in-law nightmare, as Harold deals with his menacing Hispanic caricature of a father-in-law (Danny Trejo), who comically resembles the villain portrayed by Trejo in “Once Upon a Time in Mexico.”
Some of these jokes do provide the classic comedy and jesting irreverence with which Harold and Kumar are traditionally associated. Bawdy humor and dramatic irony that satirize racism and discrimination pervade the film—a virgin desperately seeking to pop her cherry tries to rape Harold after turning down Kumar with the perfunctory comment “I don’t date black guys.” Neil Patrick Harris plays an ingenious parody of himself: a gay actor who uses his supposed homosexuality as a front to get close to the ladies.
But while these gags succeed, most of the film is comprised of crass jokes with little imagination. For instance, when Harold and Kumar concoct a plan to steal a Christmas tree from a church, scenes of naked nuns and a pedophilic bishop undermine the humor of the scenario and shade into vulgarity. Similarly, the film’s Heaven is unoriginally portrayed as chock full of booze and breast-baring broads.
The actors themselves do the best they can with this material, but are consistently diverted by the feeble script and even feebler comedy. Thus, while there are several touching scenes between the two protagonists as they attempt to reconnect after many lost years, Harold and Kumar’s shared moments are ultimately marred by the film’s failed attempts at humor.
The close of the movie hints at a possible fourth installment to the series. But if you’re not a Harold and Kumar fan, don’t expect “A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas” to make you a believer.

“The Rum Diary,” based on the novel by the late author and iconoclast Hunter S. Thompson, sets itself up as a cinematic love letter to the prolific writer’s persona—a characteristically drug-fueled wild ride through the vibrant jungles of 1960s Puerto Rico. Johnny Depp is cast as Paul Kemp, a hard-drinking journalist in the Caribbean, with Aaron Eckhart as Sanderson, a shady businessman who attempts to co-opt Kemp’s coverage for personal gain. The formula is promising but ultimately lacks both depth and direction, and comes off more like a flawed imitation of the Thompson aesthetic than a fully realized tribute.
The biggest issue in “The Rum Diary” is narrative. A movie can, of course, create meaningful characters and develop a rich universe without a serious plot, and that is clearly the film’s aspiration. But instead of being immersive and illuminating, the film’s meandering comes across more as mere aimlessness.
To start with, the movie takes far too long to set up its characters and their motivations. Each time the narrative attempts to progress to something more complex, the film jumps to some superfluous scene about cock-fighting or a bit of self-sabotaging comedic relief. It’s as if the filmmakers thought that they could counterbalance every three scenes of exposition or heavy-handed social commentary with arbitrary gags. The result is, unsurprisingly, a complete lack of focus.
This confusion extends beyond the movie’s narrative and into its thematic elements. “The Rum Diary” begins with scenes of violence, corruption, and greed that involve engaging ethical dilemmas. But just when the tone seems settled, it is undermined by unnecessary subplots that muddle the message and leave viewers befuddled. Sometimes, the plot spins so far out of control that we are left watching the actors desperately attempting to fend for themselves without a coherent script or storyline.
A prime example: after taking hits from a liquid hallucinogen, Kemp and his sidekick Sala (Michael Rispoli) spend an entire scene asking one other if they can feel the high. There is no point to this segment beyond creating an atmosphere of confusion, something the movie has far too much of already. Even when the scene lapses into a nihilistic montage with a dour Depp voiceover, what might have been an attempt at visual narration comes across as an on-the-nose delivery of the movie’s main points. One gets the distinct impression here, as throughout the film, that Thompson himself would have made much more artful use of the same tropes.
Even more jarring than the film’s narrative and thematic disjunctions is the inconsistency of its central character. On the surface, Kemp serves as a proxy for Thompson himself, as he deals with similar issues of morality and internal strife as the author. When he penned “The Rum Diary,” Thompson was still an unknown trying to find his literary voice. Thus, Depp’s character often makes comments that echo the anxieties of a struggling writer like “I got no voice. I don’t know how to write like me” and “When will this blizzard of shame go on?” We see glimpses of the iconic gonzo journalist of “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas” fame, yet these snippets of Thompson-like style don’t always match up with the rest of the character. In theory, Kemp, like Thompson, is meant to grow from a young, aimless novelist into an impassioned and noble advocacy journalist. But as portrayed in “The Rum Diary,” this transformation is more like a personality disorder. One minute, the character is full of rage, but in the next moment, such ire disappears and what remains is merely Paul Kemp, resident ambivalent protagonist.
“The Rum Diary” had the potential to be a lasting tribute to a literary folk hero. But instead, it plays more like a meandering, inconsistent assemblage of references and imitations of Hunter S. Thompson’s style. For a movie with such potent source material and Depp’s impressive talent, that is a profound cinematic disappointment.

“Like Crazy” has all the features of a clichéd love story: two unrealistically attractive co-stars, a difficult situation that keeps them apart, and several slow soundtrack ballads throughout the ups and downs of their relationship to keep the tears flowing. It’s a modern take on the classic star-crossed lovers tale, but “Like Crazy” brings a bit more to the table than that. The content is more mature than that of most flicks in the genre, and its jump-cut filming captured with a still camera gives the movie a contemporary, avant-garde flair. As an emotional drama with believable actors and enough style to set it apart, “Like Crazy” successfully breaks the mold of sappy romance movies while still necessitating a box of tissues.
The film begins by introducing Anna (Felicity Jones) and Jacob (Anton Yelchin), two college students in Los Angeles who quickly become smitten with each other. As a citizen of the United Kingdom, Anna finds herself unable to leave Jacob when her term abroad ends, and chooses to overstay her visa instead. She eventually returns to the UK but then is denied reentry to the United States due to the violation. Meanwhile, Jacob’s thriving furniture business in the States prevents him from packing up and moving to England. The rest of the film follows Anna and Jacob’s romance—and sometimes lack thereof—as they attempt to maintain an overseas relationship.
The plot moves quickly because it encompasses eight years of the characters’ lives, from age 19 to 27. This allows the film to include more mature relationship issues than those commonly portrayed in love stories made for the same demographic. Thus, rather than butting heads over prom, Jacob and Anna find themselves dealing with questions of marriage and career paths. At the same time, “Like Crazy” doesn’t feel rushed. Rather, the film slows down at just the right moments in order to emphasize aspects of Anna’s and Jacob’s relationship seldom seen in mainstream love flicks. It’s a movie low on heady emotional thrills and heavier on the characters’ pain and uncertainty—a film that actually entertains the possibility that circumstances beyond anyone’s control may actually succeed in keeping its protagonists apart.
Director Drake Doremus chose to use an unorthodox scripting method for “Like Crazy.” Though he and co-writer Ben York Jones crafted a very specific 50-page outline full of content and basic stage direction, all of the movie’s dialogue was improvised by the actors. Such unusual quirks made it quite difficult to get funding for the film; it was ultimately made for a mere $250,000, pocket change in the movie world.
“Like Crazy” was then filmed in 22 days with a still camera, and the simplicity of this filming style gives the movie a sense of modern aesthetic that also reflects its day-to-day tone. This almost monotonous method seems fitting because the film’s protagonists are constantly kept apart by inexorable everyday factors. Unlike most modern romances, “Like Crazy” recognizes the role of the mundane in real-world relationships.
Part of the undeniable charm of the film can be attributed to its up-and-coming actors. Jones is not a household name yet, but her poignant performance in “Like Crazy” may help to change that. The British actress didn’t even meet Doremus and co-star Yelchin until the first day of rehearsal, but one would never know it. The actress’s eyes convey more emotion in each scene than even her improvised dialogue, and the chemistry that exists between her and Yelchin is the sort rarely seen on screen.
Yelchin’s previous roles have had a sort of boy-next-door innocence, but his character in “Like Crazy” exudes a more composed maturity that perfectly exemplifies the tone of the film. Both actors’ performances really make you feel like you’re watching intimate snippets of a relationship accidentally filmed and put on screen, free of the bells and whistles that too often accompany similar movies.
“Like Crazy” is not your typical, mushy love movie. It never promises a happy ending, but rather takes a more realistic approach to a situation that countless individuals find themselves in every day. Though sniffles will admittedly be heard throughout the theater, “Like Crazy” manages to present the tropes of a classic love story in a way that doesn’t feel cheesy or forced. For that, it is a welcome exception in the world of romantic dramas.

“Puss in Boots,” Dreamworks Studios’s latest animated film, stars the scene-stealing feline outlaw who first appeared in “Shrek 2.” The story takes place before Puss’s (Antonio Banderas) encounter with Shrek the ogre and gives insight into his self-described “bad kitty” past. “Puss in Boots” is not a mere kid’s movie; it is a family movie, one that children will enjoy while parents and older members of the family laugh at jokes the kids don't understand. This balancing act is mostly successful, and along with Banderas’s inspired performance, makes the film one of Dreamworks’s best in recent memory.
Aside from its protagonist, the film features an almost entirely new cast of characters in the Shrek universe. Antonio Banderas reprises his role as Puss. He voices the film’s titular character with ample charm and his signature suave Spanish accent, while Salma Hayek lends her equally sensuous tones to the seductive Kitty Softpaws. Though Softpaws is not a traditional fairytale character, she holds her own alongside Puss’s childhood friend Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), as well as outlaws Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris).
Without Shrek staples Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron Diaz, it is up to Banderas and his new co-stars to carry the film, which they manage with aplomb. So while viewers hoping for an appearance from Shrek, Donkey, or Fiona will be disappointed, the best feature of the “Shrek” film franchise—the distortion of fairytale characters into twisted and hilarious caricatures—is well preserved, to the movie’s credit. After all, who wouldn’t want to see Jack and Jill reimagined as a grotesque and murderous married couple with soft spots for swine?
The film’s plot contains elements from various fairytales and fables, all mashed up into the “Shrek” series’s trademark subversive jumble. As with the previous “Shrek” movies, the animation is stunning, so rich that individual strands of Puss’s fur can be seen. The landscapes are realistic and varied: Puss’s Spanish village is charmingly quaint and the film’s desert brings to mind the settings of countless Westerns.
Of course, the principal reason to watch this movie is not the scenery but its utterly adorable, irascible and charming main character, brought deliciously to life by Banderas. In his capable hands, Puss proves as irresistable as the countless internet memes involving kittens that proliferate on YouTube and Tumblr. His signature wide-eyed look never gets old, and only improves in 3D.
Alongside its overt cuteness, the movie also has some edgier punchlines that will fly over the typical preteen’s head. Most of these jokes are witty, but the cleverness does run thin at times. Expect an endless cavalcade of cat clichés as well as a plethora of egg puns and double entendres. A favorite: what happens to eggs in prison? According to Humpty Dumpty, it is not “over easy.”
As in prior “Shrek” movies, music plays an essential role in setting the irreverent tone for “Puss in Boots.” The soundtrack, largely composed by Henry P. Jackman, sports Spanish string riffs and multiple dance numbers. Indeed, one of the film’s shining moments is a dance-off between Boots and Softpaws, a scene that rivals “Everybody Wants to Be a Cat” in Disney’s “The Aristocats.” And yes, that is Lady GaGa’s “Americano” playing at movie’s end.
“Puss in Boots” combines this humor with some romance—granted, between two cats—and lots of action, as well as some genuinely meaningful moments. The film is surprisingly effective at conveying its ostensibly trite moral—it is never too late to do the right thing—in a manner that should resonate with viewers, old and young alike. Thus, while the movie lacks the emotional poignancy of a Pixar production, it nonetheless offers more than mere laughs.
Who knows what’s next for the Shrek series? Perhaps a prequel focused on Donkey’s past? A continuation of Puss’s story? Does it really matter? What is more important is that “Puss in Boots” makes this a question worth asking. With this fresh CGI comedy, director Chris Miller has reinvigorated a flagging franchise and opened the door to promising new possibilities.

What would you sell your childhood for?
That is the question that plagues Warren Straub (Ben J. Marek ’14) as he crouches on a floor strewn with blankets and empty bottles and surveys the antiquated memorabilia he has stuffed into a battered brown suitcase. As Dennis Ziegler (James C. Butler ’15), practically trembling with anger, looms over him, Warren looks away from his keepsakes. “Sell ’em,” he tells Dennis. “I don’t know what else to do.” This tone of combined desperation and resignation, punctuated by moments of sheepish humor, permeates the Harvard-Radcliffe Dramatic Club’s production of Kenneth Lonergan’s “This Is Our Youth,” directed by Cagla G. Seten ’13 and Katherine L. Price ’14. Subtle yet poignant acting underpins this pithy tale of lost innocence, though the arresting narrative is occasionally marred by stilted and inconsistent stagecraft.
“This Is Our Youth” chronicles the evolving relationship between the two male leads as Warren seeks refuge in Dennis’ disorderly Manhattan apartment. Having recently stolen $15,000 from his wealthy, tyrannical father after being thrown out of his house, Warren hopes to escape the ennui of his structured young-adult life in the way he believes Dennis has. Dennis, continually amazed by the supposed stupidity of his worshipping friend Warren, insists that Warren return the money immediately. Warren, however, is determined to use his new funds to impress his acquaintance Jessica Goldman (Anna A. Hagen ’15). After doing so, and losing his virginity in the process, Warren agrees to the unlikely scheme Dennis cooks up to earn back the lost money—a plan which involves both drug deals and the sale of Warren’s precious childhood souvenirs.
The play, set in 1982 and first performed in 1996, retains its relevance today with enduring themes of trying to find meaning and purpose in aimless 20-something life. Dennis and Warren both sporadically experience surging moments of optimism and ambition, tragically convinced that they will one day achieve something significant and vindicating; at other times, they realize the futility of their efforts and embrace meaninglessness. This dichotomy is mirrored in the twisted friendship between the two young men, as Warren’s frantic, nervous energy and constant chatter are consistently subdued by Dennis’ furious commands to “shut up.” Butler imbues Dennis with the easy, demeaning confidence of an idol all too aware of Warren’s adoration, but is equally adept at hinting at Dennis’ profound insecurities through simple shifts in posture and vocal timbre. “You don’t think I’m on your side?” Dennis practically screams at Warren at one point. He repeats the line a moment later, but by injecting the words with a childish pain he suggests that he needs Warren’s approval despite his charade of bloated arrogance.
Marek, a less pronounced but equally compelling presence on stage, charts the transformation of Warren’s character with nuanced body language. The naive Warren seen in the opening of the play is fidgety and self-conscious; by the end of the play, the mere act of sitting down seems to exhaust him. Hagen, meanwhile, seems to doubt her ability to channel Jessica’s character, though she proves capable of showcasing a sudden change of heart towards Warren with a single look. At times, her overexcited stage movements and lines—such as an awkward and forced “Let’s wake this dump up!”—feel exaggerated beyond credulity.
Her uncertainty, however, may be due in part to irregular stage direction that often leaves the three actors unanchored. The majority of movements occur infrequently and spasmodically, with characters suddenly standing up or deciding unanimously to sit down at the table after a lengthy conversation that was physically static. The minimal lighting effects, meanwhile, tend to distract and bewilder as the spotlight’s brightness fluctuates with no discernible trigger.
Significantly more effective are the few props that become characters’ ties to world outside Dennis’ apartment, where the entire play takes place: Dennis’ telephone is the only link with external events, while Warren’s old baseball hat becomes a symbol of the past he involuntarily discards. Ultimately, though, it is the actors who convincingly display the tension between the fear of being unremarkable and an inability to take action. That universally relatable feeling of unease ensures that “This Is Our Youth” remains as resonant today as it was 15 years ago.

Nov. 11-13, 17-19, 7:30 p.m.
Loeb Experimental Theater
Directed by Daniel J. Giles ’13
Produced by Bryce J. Gilfillian ’12 and Marit A. Medefind ’12
With buckled knees, modern dance, and ape-like gaits, Daniel J. Giles ’13, director and writer of “CryHurtFood,” blurs the line between human and chimpanzee.
A play based on a story Giles once heard on nationally syndicated radio program Radiolab, “CryHurtFood” tells the impassioned story of Janis (Margaret C. Kerr ’13), a scientist who first tries to make her ape friends act human before reversing course. At one point, Janis lets her control slip and yells at one of her apes, “This is not an experiment, this is a mission!” thereby hinting at the chaos that will ensue as she tries to convince chimpanzees that they are not humans, as she had previously led them to believe.
“The idea of a person playing an animal that thinks it’s a person is so theatrical,” Giles says, while on stage his actors engage in a violent yet elegant series of steps, with the human protagonist attempting to prop up her chimpanzee counterpart. The characters mimic each other and leap with alternating agility and imbalance, a routine that confuses which actor is playing a human, and which actor is playing a chimpanzee.
In a cast of six characters, it shouldn’t be too hard to keep the two species separate, but choreographer Mariel N. Pettee ’14 intentionally blends human and ape gestures. During the frequent dance interludes, human and chimp seem to digress from the evolutionary timeline and morph into one species. “A lot of it was watching videos of monkeys, watching ‘Tarzan,’ and seeing exactly how monkeys and their physical bodies differ from humans,” says Pettee.
The play also presents a challenge for the actors, who have to portray chimpanzees, humans who wish they were chimpanzees, and chimpanzees who thought they were humans but are now told that they are chimpanzees. “It was very interesting learning to be a monkey … it’s definitely a work-out,” says Kathleen S. O’Beirne ’15, who plays one of the chimpanzees. The actors have to crawl like monkeys and fall over one other.
Convincingly portraying a chimpanzee on stage—a talking, dancing, and singing chimpanzee, no less—constitutes a bit of a risk, as so much of the show’s success will be determined by the poise of the actors in cleanly timed dances and subtle gestures. But if the rehearsal is any indication, “CryHurtFood” should open next Friday night with a set of actors well prepared to tell a complicated but touching story of identity.

“Stick close to your desks and never go to sea, / And you all may be rulers of the Queen’s Navee!” sings silver-mustachioed Sir Joseph Porter (Christian N. Føhrby ’14) with flailing hands. The Harvard-Radcliffe Gilbert & Sullivan Players’ (HRG&SP) rendition of the nautical operetta “H.M.S. Pinafore; or, The Lass that Loved a Sailor”—which runs until November 13 at the Agassiz Theatre—let the libretto sparkle with winking revelry. Gilbert and Sullivan operettas give actors license to be exuberant, and the cast’s earnest verve coupled with a fresh set interpretation and skillful accompaniment creates an irresistible pick-me-up of a production.
“H.M.S. Pinafore” chronicles two mismatched couples: Captain Corcoran (Eric Padilla ’14) with greying vendor Buttercup (Amelia H. Ross ’14) and dashing young sailor Ralph Rackstraw (Joseph S.C. Goodknight) with the Captain’s daughter Josephine (Allison A. Ray ’14). Complicating the star-struck lovers’ dilemma is the pompously effeminate Føhrby, who wishes to ask for Josephine’s hand in marriage. Added to a chorus of sailors and Sir Joseph’s “sisters, cousins, and aunts,” the cast numbers 20, each member more enthusiastic than the last.
While the operetta is traditionally set on a 19th-century Royal Navy vessel, HRG&SP’s “Pinafore” takes place on a 1930s cruise liner complete with shuffleboard and bright-colored, wide-shouldered dresses. The change lends an infectious silliness to the production. In a show that is lyrically canonical, the bright whitewashed ship walls and costumes make every chorus number seem even more vibrant.
Standing out amongst the joyful multitudes is Padilla’s bright-eyed Captain, showcasing an excellent stage presence and comedic timing in tandem with Ross’ Jack Sparrow-esque Buttercup. During the number “Things are seldom what they seem,” Ross’ liquid movements and low timbre are chilling while Padilla’s puzzled asides to the audience keep the mood light. Dick Deadeye (Thomas C. Wilhoit ’13), the cantankerous crippled seaman, also provides a humorous dose of schadenfreude. He manages to steal some attention amid the commotion with his slow, Herman Cain-like smile during Ralph’s suicide attempt.
As the main pairing of “Pinafore,” Goodknight and Ray play the Sailor and the Lass admirably. Ray’s pure soprano is the vocal highlight of the production, and she hits every potentially ear-splitting note with grace. Ray’s singing superiority could make the couple seem mismatched in more than just economic stature. Fortunately, Goodknight’s golden-boy aura makes him the perfect subject of “For he is an Englishman,” the show’s focal number, and more than compensates for his comparable lack of range.
Music director Lucien D. Werner ’13 does a flawless job of leading the 26-piece orchestra. Music and stage blend so seamlessly that the score feels more like an extension of the actors’ emotions than routine instrumental backing—a rare feat. The best numbers are ballads such as “Fair moon, to thee I sing” and “Sorry her lot who loves too well,” quiet numbers where the orchestra might otherwise overpower the vocals but manages to enhance them instead.
The show runs into a few staging difficulties, mostly confined to a male chorus that struggled with synchronization. There are several occasions, especially in the first act, when members of the cast look impatient because the sailors of the male chorus aren’t moving up and down the two-level stage fast enough. However, such slip-ups are the exception rather than the rule, and the female chorus’s cartoon villain approach to “Carefully on tiptoe stealing” more than makes up for the small glitches in choreography.
“Pinafore” is not a production for those looking for Kafkaesque struggles or renditions of actors exploring their emotional range, and the cast thankfully does not have any such pretensions. Instead, it is a well-executed comedy that avoids turning saccharine with an injection of dramatic relief. Sewed together by talented actors, musicians, and artists, “Pinafore” will delight those looking for cleanly performed cleverness from a group that obviously loves what they do.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s Monday night of the last week in October, and I am at a poetry reading. It is taking place in the Barker Center’s Thompson Room. Henri Cole is reciting. Full disclosure: I don’t know much about poetry. I read poems, often, for their beauty, and for the truth found therein—for, after all, as John Keats wrote, “that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.” In terms of analysis, however, I admit incompetence. Connotation often eludes me. Sometimes even denotation, too.
When I eased open the paned glass door of the Thompson Room to attend my first reading last February, I felt at once like an intruder. Tweed and skinny jeans alternated on the plush quilted seats; tenured professors and hipster students interspersed, if not intermingling. The introduction was punctured by chuckles at jokes I didn’t understand. Every so often the couple in front of me exchanged knowing smirks at allusions whose meanings I also probably missed.
I don’t remember who the poet speaking was, and, more embarrassingly, I can’t recall any of the names of his poems, or any phrases from what he read. But I remember slipping out at the end with the feeling I always get when finishing a particularly good novel: satiated just as completely as after a filling meal, yet still plagued by a sort of drifting aching lack.
It’s the lack, I think, that has driven me back to the Thompson Room or Woodberry Room time and again, though I’m still as much the outsider I ever was.
On the Monday night in October, Henri Cole reads his poem “Poppies”: “The way in and the way out / are the same, essentially: emotions disrupting thought…”
Sometimes, when I read novels for class, I am delighted by the proliferation of new meanings and the exposure of new truths that comes from close analysis of a text. Other times it seems that I am merely hacking a work apart, leaving myself to survey the severed limbs of dismembered phrases, and I am dismayed by my own critical thought. I turn, then, back to the indulgence of novels read on my own time, but the mastery of reason over sentiment remains: one has been gained; the other, irrevocably lost.
I seek an alternative in poetry, perhaps because it is something I don’t easily understand. It is something in which mystery still lingers. Sometimes at poetry readings I lose track of the verses. A beguiling phrase sets me off on my own thoughts and lulls me along by the rhythm of the speaker’s speech, until my thoughts meander back to attention. I probably shouldn’t do this. It’s probably not what listening to poetry is all about.
Henri Cole, like many of the poets I’ve heard, impeccably enunciates each of his words. At the end of every verse his voice dips. It creates a tone of melancholy that I wonder if he sustains during regular speech. Cole talks a little about his international childhood: born in Japan to an American father and French mother, he was raised in the countryside of Virginia. In an interview, he recalls growing up in a household where three languages—French, Armenian, and English—were spoken, though he understood only one. He speaks about his resulting emphasis on and sensitivity to tone:
And hearing this braid of languages regularly spoken heightened my sense of words as a kind of loge in which desires were illuminated, memory was recovered and poems would be assembled.
Cole conceives of his poetry in part as an attempt to recast the link between language and emotion. Apparently, poets of the last few decades have shied away from the type of personal, sensation-driven work whose sources can perhaps be traced to Romanticism, in favor of ahistorical, a-sentimental verse. Nowhere is Cole’s challenge to this trend clearer to me than when he reads his works aloud.
From his poem “Dead Wren”:
Night—what beams does it clear away?
The rain falls. The sky is pained. All that breathes suffers.
Yet the waters of affliction are purifying.
The wounded soldier heals. There is new wine and oil.
Here, take my handkerchief as your hearse.
I do not understand all of what he says. I might understand it better if I were to sit, sharpened pencil in hand, parsing out the language and symbols and techniques. This would also be worthwhile.
For now, I sit in the back of the Thompson Room and listen to the lilting cadences. I fail to catch some words and meanings, but somehow feel less out of place. Navigating between language and emotion, between content and sentiment, I wander among the spoken words.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It’s only November, but corporate America has officially begun to look forward to the holiday season. Radio stations are playing a rotation of Christmas songs, red and green decorations have replaced the Halloween candy in the seasonal isle, and the New York City Ballet has started promoting its famous version of “The Nutcracker.” Performances won’t begin until November 25, but tickets are already on sale. This year, the New York City Ballet and Lincoln Center have coordinated to bring audiences the December 13 performance on film in movie theaters around the country, making this particular holiday tradition more accessible than ever.
Showing performance art in theaters is nothing new, but the decision to broadcast “The Nutcracker” surprised me. The film version of the corps’s performance will only air on the night of December 13 in select theaters, perhaps in order to replicate the uniqueness of each live performance or to preserve ticket sales for the rest of the show’s run. The strategy of bringing performance to a wider audience in theaters, especially with the special appeal of a one-night-only experience, has some obvious advantages. More people will see the show—not least because of the cheaper ticket prices for the theater viewing—and an otherwise fleeting live performance will be carefully shot and preserved permanently on tape. Despite these advantages, though, my initial reaction to this news was negative. Wouldn’t the performance lose something crucial if the audience wasn’t actually in front of the dancers?
When I went to see the Boston performance of “The Nutcracker” last year, I was struck most by the dancers’ almost inhumanly perfect execution. Only the sound of their shoes when the music went quiet reminded me that these were real people only a few hundred feet away from me. I can’t imagine this sensation affecting an audience watching from a movie theater, where we are trained to accept any spectacle without much amazement. In popular cinema we see cities blown up in front of our eyes, humans transformed into monsters, and people brutally killed in every possible way. My fear for ballet on the big screen is that we will forget that these are not special effects, but extraordinarily talented people performing in real time. Nothing shocks us on the big screen anymore, but watching a ballerina endlessly pirouette in front of you can provoke no other response. Experienced in person, the performance can make you physically ache and make you feel viscerally how incapable your own body is of the dancers’ precise movements.
These and many others were the anxieties that came to my mind as I imagined viewing a live experience through a screen. I worried that the live performance would be changed by the dancers’ knowledge that there would be on camera close-ups of their expressions as they danced; I even worried that this would eventually lead to the demise of the live theaters in major cities, and a completely new definition of what constitutes ballet.
But then I realized that maybe this negative perspective on change says more about myself than about the New York City Ballet’s “Nutcracker.” I must face the fact that I am a member of the traditionalist camp, always hesitant to change an art form that is already beautiful. But even I am coming to realize what nearly every artist and arts organization has already accepted: that we are left with little choice other than to take the plunge and hope that the good outweighs the bad. The New York City Ballet is by no means the first arts organization to tape the live performances for which they are renowned. The Metropolitan Opera has been broadcasting its performances since 2006. The project has been a great success, drawing in major revenue and attracting much larger audiences than would be possible for live performances alone. While there may be some drawbacks, staying relevant and incorporating every new development is more likely to create long-term success than refusing to meet the demands of a world that is coming to rely more on technology every day. So for now, I’m not about to buy tickets to a taped performance of “The Nutcracker,” but I’m sure many others will—and maybe when the theater goes quiet, they too will hear the quiet sound of tapping shoes.

An event occurs, or a person appears, within the pages of a novel. As readers, we know it’s our job to make something of it. Fictional description in this form cannot escape the fact that it must mean something. But what connects the description and the message? What is the bridge between details and the meanings made of? This question, a necessary one to any novel, is the motivating force of Andrej Stasiuk’s philosophical masterwork “Dukla.”
What distinguishes “Dukla” is its self-consciousness of and devotion to building this bridge. Stasiuk, a postmodern Polish writer of great fame in his home country, is chiefly concerned with the limits and potentialities of description. “There’s one sure consolation,” Stasiuk writes, “the Image, twin brother of our mind, will outlive us.” This is the bow that ties up the apparent contradiction between Stasiuk’s attempt to find value and coherence in human life and his belief that all things human are transient and contingent. Through a series of prose-poetic portraits and landscapes of Dukla, a small town in Poland, Stasiuk demonstrates how the everyday can be interwoven with the eternal.
The most powerful coupling of the quotidian and the lofty comes in a description of a teenage girl at a discotheque from the perspective of a 13-year-old boy. The girl, languorous, gold-skinned, gestures with the “deliberate inertia of matter. She resembled liquid mercury.” Yet, at the same time, she has “an animal-like allure that seems to have no awareness of itself, and even if it does, it’s conscious more of its own strength than of its beauty.”
Here is a way for Stasiuk to retain social ideas crucial to life and art—in this case, human grace—while thinking outside, or rather beyond, conventional modes of understanding. The comparisons to “liquid mercury” and “animal-like allure” establish an unexpected metaphorical matrix for the girl, one in which we understand her not in terms of the social experience of young love but instead in the metaphysical truth of instinctual attraction among animals, the intrinsic wonder of space materials. For Stasiuk, the disco itself is cruel and sordid; at one point, an older woman calls the girl a whore. To see something wondrous, one must look past a social context.
That doesn’t mean Stasiuk is unconcerned with the commonplace. As its title implies, “Dukla” grasps at understanding completely a specific place. What matters less than Dukla itself, however, is the way in which we ought to perceive something like Dukla. “My method is primitive,” Stasiuk writes. “It’s like drilling at random. In principle it could be done anywhere.” What are the criteria of this method? A clue can be found in the papal visit to Dukla. Stasiuk sketches out the small talk between old women, the manner in which truck drivers smoke their cigarettes, the pomp created by photographers and religious officials coming to town. The pope himself is inconsequential to the novel. It’s not the unique center of the event that counts, but the tittering periphery that always builds up around any kind of hoopla.
Thus, “Dukla” is largely a search for the bare necessities of common experience, the substratum under shared morals and culture. Stasiuk describes his protagonist’s mode of description as “preferring to reflect on … what connects us in a way that can’t be undermined. We’ll experience the same thing as everyone else. In the same air, the same space that took all those who came before us.” We share less than we think, and yet what we share is more fundamental than we notice. For Stasiuk, the simplest commonalities are the most important: his novel is an potential of the human condition as a tie that binds.
This explains the rationale behind situating “Dukla” around Dukla, the town in Poland. The physical landscape is composed of the essentials: a general store, a church, a town square. The point is not to demonstrate what human life can be, but in a much more ambitious sense what human life can always be broken down to. Clement Greenberg thought the task of the modernist painter was to purify the art by painting only what was essential in painting. In much the same way, Stasiuk seeks to pare down human experience to its definitive core.
Just as Greenberg’s painters would limit their tools to the basics, nothing more than combinations of line and color, Stasiuk does away with narrative frills in favor of a series of descriptions, each of which embodies some of his basic ideas about perception and refract on his other scenes and portraits. To some extent, it’s useful to think of “Dukla” as a critical text about the possibilities of the contemporary novel. Stasiuk’s method of perception is a model for how literary texts can work after faith in plot, character development, and social criticism has been extinguished. The novel must be rebuilt from the ground up.

“Who is the anti-Semite?” asks Jean-Paul Sartre at the beginning of his 1946 book “Anti-Semite and Jew.” Sartre answers: “The anti-Semite is someone who hates himself.” Sartre goes on to argue that there is no such thing as ‘the Jew,’ in essentialist terms. It is not the Jew who engenders anti-Semitism, but rather the anti-Semite who creates the Jew, searching for an object of hatred. Sartre’s thesis is a problematic one, as it suggests that Judaism and Jewish culture are devoid of actual content, and yet it is one that is understandable in the wake of the Holocaust. Since then, however, the way that we think about anti-Semitism has changed.
Or has it? Umberto Eco’s latest novel “The Prague Cemetery” tells the story of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” a document first published in Russia in 1903 that falsely described a Jewish plot for world domination. The text was used as an excuse by the Nazis for their systematic genocide of Jews, and it continues to be disseminated today by anti-Semites around the world. Eco’s investigates semiotics—the study of signs and their relation to the objects that seek to represent—and is postmodern in nature, often referring to “the Narrator” and “the Reader.” This choice is perhaps unsurprising given that Eco is one of Italy’s most prominent semioticians. Importantly, he emphasizes in his preface that the novel is based entirely on real events. He writes: “The Prague Cemetery is a story in which all of the characters except one—the main characters really existed. Even the hero’s grandfather, the author of a mysterious actual letter that triggered modern anti-Semitism, is historical.” To further underline the historicity of the text, Eco makes use of illustration, which also ties into his interest in exploring different types of signs. Interspersed throughout the text are 19th-century prints coupled with captions drawn from the text of the novel. The final page is a reproduction of the cover of the first Russian edition of “The Protocols.” Although ‘the Reader’ never expects subtlety in this kind of novel, the complete lack thereof in “The Prague Cemetery” renders it neither thought-provoking nor enjoyable.
Eco traces the story of the fictional Italian Simone Simioni, who grows up in Piedmont just before the unification of Italy, and ultimately helps pen “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.” His grandfather was a virulent anti-Semite (and, as Eco reminds us several times, a real person). Simioni, inheriting his grandfather’s obsessive hatred of the Jews—“I dreamt about Jews every night for years and years”––experiences some of the most significant events of the 19th century in Italy and France, using them all as opportunities to besmirch and persecute Jews. Simioni lives through the Risorgimento, the Paris Commune, and ultimately the Dreyfus Affair; the novel suggests that it was Simioni himself who framed Dreyfus. The personal drama that fuels the narrative is Simioni’s own confusion about his identity; the novel opens with Simioni unsure of what has happened to him or who exactly he is. The story is partially told through letters between Simioni and the mysterious Abbé Della Piccola, who seems to live in Simioni’s apartment and can recall certain facts that Simioni has forgotten. Each man considers that they might be the same person, but quickly dismisses this possibility. I do not think that it spoils the book to say that they should have trusted their intuitions.  In the middle of the novel, ‘the Reader’ learns that Simioni once murdered an Abbé Della Piccola who got in the way of his latest anti-Semitic project. Eco’s use of Piccola as Simioni’s alter ego is a means of exploring ‘the Other’ that exists inside of us all, the very same notion that Sartre addressed in his 1946 work. Toward the end of the novel, ‘the Narrator’ tells us: “It was time to accept that the Other did not exist. The diary, moreover, is a solitary entertainment. He had, however, become accustomed to this monody and decided to continue. Not that he felt any particular love toward himself, but his dislike of others induced him to make the best of his own company.” Indeed, the amnesia that Simioni experiences is precipitated by a sexual encounter with a woman of Jewish origin, when he is dressed up as Della Piccola ostensibly for reasons of subterfuge. After the trauma of recognizing his attraction to a Jewish woman, Simioni is unable to distinguish his true self from his false identity as Della Piccola. He has to split himself from his internal ‘other’ as a means of suppressing it.
However, the split personality’s role is more complex than simply revealing people’s secret and subconscious selves. The trope also allows Eco to explore the role of the signifier itself. Early on, Simioni reveals that he likes to dress up as others: “what I most enjoyed was appearing to be someone else; the thought that people had no idea who I really was gave me a sense of superiority. I had a secret.” Like a costume, a sign is a representation with multiple layers, which can only be read by those who have the tools to understand it. This logic is also crucial to understanding Eco’s interest in the genesis of “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,” which is, after all, a false secret text, full of signifiers that must be measured for their authenticity. But while the concept has merit, Eco’s reduction of European anti-Semitism in the 19th century to a historical novel about donning another’s robes ultimately fails to do justice to the topic. Despite his deep awareness of semiotics, Eco’s own representation of historical truth is ironically too simplistic to pass muster.

“A theoretical physicist,” is one way Lisa Randall likes to describe herself. Randall, a Frank B. Baird, Jr., Professor of Science at Harvard University, teamed up with artist and Chapman University Assistant Professor of Fine Art Lia Halloran to curate a Los Angeles-based contemporary art exhibit. Yet this is by no means Randall’s first foray into the art world. Having already published another book, “Knocking on Heaven’s Door,” and written the libretto for opera “Hypermusic: A Projective Opera in Seven Planes,” Randall has been making inroads with the art community for years now. With the collaboration of these distinguished curators—a scientist and an artist—“Measure for Measure” promises to be an innovative and eccentric collection. The exhibit will run until December 22 in the Carpenter Center.
Nonetheless, anyone walking into the exhibit “Measure for Measure” expecting to find a cohesive, scientific message in art should prepare to be disappointed. “Measure for Measure” is not the elegant fusion of science and art that the combination of the curators’ celebrated intellectual and artistic forces might suggest. The exhibit, a multimedia synthesis of several Los Angeles artists, is instead a series of individual explorations and interpretations bound loosely together by the oddly abstract concept of scale—how things are understood differently from different perspectives. While the exhibit is less cohesive and scientific than could be expected, the diverse artists assembled by Randall and Halloran do not disappoint. Their potent and differing perceptions of scale engage the visitor through equally varied media.
Though an essential concept of Randall’s field, the rather vague theme of scale is inclusive of far more than theoretical physics. Because the concept is so inclusive, the exhibit is loosely correlated and lacks a central message. However, this opens up the possibility for the artists to perform very different explorations through diverse media that still relate well to this abstract theme.
The first work one sees upon walking through the doors is Katrina McElroy’s “Migratory Flow.” This piece is composed of 852 modified video stills printed on vinyl in the shape of small circles and directly adhered to the wall. From a distance, the pattern gives the impression of a flattened helix and employs very organic colors, giving the impression of life. As one approaches, though, it becomes apparent that each is a video still depicting a different version of the same event or scene. McElroy’s work embodies the concept of scale by creating many different interpretations of the same artistic piece when viewed from different distances. Given this relatively basic, uncomplicated embodiment of the concept, McElroy’s piece is appropriately positioned—right at the front of the exhibit. The curators thus confront visitors early with one of the most apparent forms of the theme so as to ease into more obscure constructions.
As one ventures further into the relatively open space of the exhibit, the concept of scale becomes more complicated while the media vary widely from acrylic paint to hung Plexiglas. Susan Sironi’s “A Portrait in Four Parts” presents scale by playing directly with the construction of a larger scale through smaller ones. Displayed are four opened books that have had the pages cut into and drawn upon so as to create three-dimensional scenes from the two-dimensional paper. With this, she presents more than new interpretations between smaller and larger scales. She also uses these isolated, essentially two-dimensional pages to help construct an entirely new third-dimension. This advances a new perspective on viewing the world by both offering different interpretations of what already is present and creating new ideas that did not exist before. While this shares elements with McElroy’s interpretation of divining more of what is there, Sironi qualifies her concept slightly to include the construction of the new dimension and a new idea.
The work that best embodies the contrast of ideas under the broad umbrella of scale is Elizabeth Tobias’ performance and installation piece, “Let Them Eat Cupcakes.” Appropriately set aside from some of the other pieces, her work involves a large, eerie tent filled with images of sprinkles and large index cards hung from Chinese lanterns. Instead of looking at scale as a matter of contrasting significance at several physical sizes, she looks at it in terms of hunger in Los Angeles. The exhibit poignantly emphasizes the extravagance of cupcakes when there is hunger at large. Tobias deftly and subtly incorporates scale by pointing to the preoccupation with self over society that leads to such individual extravagance. During the exhibit, she hands out free cupcakes for exhibit visitors to eat while reading crowdsourced quotes on the index cards about hunger. Her work is also dynamic as she asks visitors to write a new reflection on an index card, continuing the method of crowdsourcing and expanding her work. Taken together, the performance and installation work illuminate the horrors of hunger in America’s second wealthiest city.
The curators’ selection of the distinctive works that make up the exhibit is one of “Measure for Measure’s” strengths. The exhibit sacrifices a strong, central, over-arching message to tie the work together or any strong relation to science—aspects generally unexpected from curators Randall and Halloran. However, the abstract theme of scale allows for many different artistic interpretations. This, along with use of various media fosters a higher level of engagement and contemplation of the exhibit as a whole. Without placing heavy emphasis on entirely scientific ideas, Randall and Halloran engage fully with the art. Their most significant contribution to the exhibit is their ability to draw some of the most innovative contemporary artists in Los Angeles.

Couches, paper cups and newspapers are not normally art, but it just those materials that Jessica Jackson Hutchins—the wife of Stephen Malkmus of the band Pavement—transforms in her work. Hutchins’s first solo gallery show in a museum is on display at the Institute of Contemporary Art until March 4 and features some of her work from the past year. The show conveys a feeling of haphazardness, both through Hutchins’s unusual techniques and as a result of their interesting incongruities, and provides the viewer with an engaging variety of textures and tones that defy easy interpretation.
“Symposion,” a sculpture, is literally the focus of the exhibit and sits directly in the middle of a room that holds the other eight pieces. Curator Jenelle Porter’s statement on the wall of the gallery relates “Symposion” to the ancient Greek party—which included food, drink, speeches and, apparently, sex—after which it was named. Indeed there is something about the amorphous grey papier-mâché shapes encircling and resting on the couch that is reminiscent of nudity, but the sculpture has none of the beauty generally associated with figures from antiquity. Instead the whole work is rather grotesque. The papier-mâché pieces, which seem to represent figures, have entirely overwhelmed the sagging, over-saturated turquoise couch; an obese mass of gray protrudes from all sides and precariously drapes over its sides and back. Atop the papier-mâché figures sit three shiny ceramic pots that seem to have melted into the figures just as they have melted into the couch. The piece’s laziness is as engrossing as it is grotesque, as if it were a literal interpretation of a couch potato. With the advertisements on the newspaper in the papier-mâché still discernable, the piece reads as a statement on our own modern culture.
The rest of the show has little in common with the centerpiece. Dispersed around the walls of the gallery are eight of Hutchins’s collaged drawings, also all from this past year. Where “Symposion” projects a grotesque, manipulated slobbishness, these pieces feel more fragile and impulsive and are unified by the recurrence of punctuation marks constructed from papier-mâché, paper cups, and other techniques. The effect is almost humorous. There is something complex or emphatic underlying them, but Hutchins reveals little of what it may be. In one work entitled “Landscape,” located in the left corner on the opposite wall of the gallery entrance, an exclamation mark and quotation marks are torn out of smudged white paper to reveal an abstract blend of earth tones and the blue colors of water. It seems to illustrate the attempt to narrate a beautiful landscape, as opposed to the traditional visual representation of the landscape itself.
In other cases, punctuation marks are used as building blocks of other images. In “Aztec Power Sign,” the first drawing to the right of the entrance, five commas—or apostrophes—are grouped to create what looks like an abstracted take on the cultural emblem after which the piece is titled. Once again, the fact that punctuation from the English language is used in such a representation is at once ironic and puzzling. Another piece directly to the left of the entrance shows what could be a confused smiley face, constructed out of a period—or maybe just a dot—and a semicolon. It is aptly named “And U Being,” as if portraying the amused and confused face of one who has just traversed the entire gallery.
The collages’ material itself is varied and quite striking. Hutchins uses a combination of opaque and more watery, translucent inks, both applied with a great deal of inexactitude, as well as spray paint, which boldly covers vast areas or adds dramatic accents. The punctuation marks are constructed, with the exception of “Landscape,” out of painted-over paper pulp or paper cups. There is something a little repulsive about Hutchins’s usage of paper pulp, but it is texturally quite interesting and creates sickly mountain ranges under the paint. Even the cups add to the overall diversity of texture and juxtaposition of the strong and the fragile.
It’s hard to know what to make of these delicate yet emphatic compositions, yet perhaps the answer lies within one of the works themselves. One piece, simply entitled “Comma,” features a few small torn pieces of newspaper, one of which, though somewhat obscured by a splotch of red paint, clearly reads “Don’t Read too Much.” Likewise, despite the obvious allusions to written work, Hutchins’s pieces are also in themselves structurally complex and intriguing as she boldly experiments with the interplay between a diverse array of textures and media.

“The older you get you’ll see / you’ll be a lot like ... me,” sings Bradford Cox on “Parallax,” his third release under his solo moniker Atlas Sound. The future may be uncertain, but if Cox’s words have any truth, then our future selves will be quite strange, to say the least. After all, Cox has dubbed “Parallax” a science fiction album, and the album’s instrumentation is a mélange of fuzzy synthesizers and robotic beeps that bring to life his imaginary future world. To his credit, however, he pulls off this weirdness skillfully and saves “Parallax” from becoming a pure gimmick. Let our future selves rejoice: we may be fated to go mad, but as Cox shows, insanity is not always a curse.
Cox is best known for fronting indie rock sensation Deerhunter, a band known for its hauntingly simple chord progressions and its trance-inducing melodies. His work as Atlas Sound uses these characteristics as a framework, but subtly twists them, almost as if he were pushing deeper into the dreamy abyss conjured by his main project. While Deerhunter’s songs are strange and twisted, often focusing on mental illness and various tragedies, the tracks on “Parallax” cover different territory, touching on time travel, parallel universes, and extra-human existential crises.
The album opens on a note of eerie dissonance with “The Shakes,” a track full of soft harmonies and layered synths that combine to create a shoegaze effect. “The Shakes” is lo-fi, but with enough excitement to provide a portal into Cox’s vision for the album. This vision is one of exploration and strangeness; Cox seems to use fantastic images and space motifs  as a template for weirdness. “I found money and fame / But I found them really late,” proclaims the song’s narrator, with an air of regretful dissatisfaction. It is exactly this attitude that characterizes the track and much of the album: a longing for something never experienced in this world. Unfortunately, “The Shakes”—like much of “Parallax”—ends abruptly, never exactly revealing the intangibles at its core.
Despite its billing as a concept album,  the songs on“Parallax” do not stick to a general ethos. Trippy cuts are immediately followed by upbeat tracks that—lyrics aside—could almost be pop songs. Take “Mona Lisa,” the most upbeat song on the album, featuring Andrew Vanwyngarden of the standout pop-electronica duo MGMT. On the one hand it’s undeniably catchy, but at the end of the day it’s still tragic: the narrator is separated from his love interest by the meddling forces of time and space. “We’re interrupted by a hundred galaxies,” sings Cox, adding a sense of unalterable sadness to the seemingly upbeat track.
Cox has a tendency to cut instrumentally peppy songs with depressing themes; the universe that “Parallax” presents is inherently flawed, with somber themes lurking behind Cox’s shiny instrumentation. Judging from its title, “Te Amo” seems like a love song, and this is certainly reinforced by its light instrumentation. Nevertheless, Cox’s modus operandi is present even here, with lyrics that sound romantic on first listen, but that are slightly more distressing on further study. “Te amo / I’ll pretend you were the only one.” It’s a love song for the video game age—electronic and fast enough to hold a short attention span.
Although “Parallax” does not present a totally unified vision, particularly due to the  unfulfilled nature of individual tracks, Cox succeeds in presenting a distinctly bizarre futuristic landscape that is all his own. Listening to “Parallax” is almost like having awakening from a strange, half-remembered dream, and even after multiple listens it’s hard to tell exactly what Cox was going for. Cox has produced an entertaining if forgettable album, one that stays true to its title. Too often, just when a track starts to get interesting, Cox is already on to the next idea, a veritable parallax in action. For the unaware, a parallax is an optical phenomenon that makes us perceive closer objects as faster when we are in motion. Indeed, once the album is over, there’s a distinct feeling that everything whizzed by too quickly.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last weekend at the Harvard Dance Center, the Harvard-Radcliffe Modern Dance Company (HRMDC) performed an anniversary show, “35: Thirty-Five Years of Dance.” Founded in 1976, HRMDC is the longest-running student-operated dance organization at Harvard. The group is entirely non-profit and runs on donations from audience members. They perform a variety of contemporary dance styles and showcase student-produced choreography.
“35” was a celebration of the HRMDC’s development from its earliest years to its wide recognition on campus today. The evening’s performance began with a group improvisation session that was spontaneous, energetic, and testified to the dancers’ artistic creativity and technical skill. This lively introduction created a sense—which remained throughout subsequent, more serious pieces—that the dancers were genuinely having fun. The show consisted of nine pieces, each with choreographic flair. Massachusetts Institute of Technology guest choreographer Stella Gaitani’s “Security” used contemporary music to present an innovative repertoire. Dancing to Coldplay’s “Fix You,” Gaitani’s cast balanced on chairs and fell to the ground; others leapt into the air in formation at the crescendo. Like many of HRMDC’s works, this piece included traditional dance moves combined with moments of carefully choreographed disorganization.
One of the highlights of the evening was “He Went Off a Bridge,” choreographed by Christian A. Rivera ’13. Set to the song “Otherside” by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, the piece was an emotionally engaging reflection about drug abuse in the music industry. Rivera is a musical choreographer: the dancers hopped rhythmically to the beat of the music, and their movements accentuated the frustration and melancholy of the song to form a powerfully moving scene. In one  particularly complicated floor sequence, the dancers swayed and crawled to the lyrics, “Swore I was goin’ to be someone, and growing up everyone always does / We sell our dreams and our potential to escape through that buzz.” In another moment, one dancer appeared to rob several others with a grabbing motion before sweeping them to the floor. Along with musical and prop selections that beautifully complemented the choreography, HRMDC varied its dancers’ costumes and its lighting design with style—and thus turned the Harvard Dance Center into an ethereal canvas for creativity.
Another noteworthy piece was “Ascend”, choreographed by Irineo C. Cabreros ’13 and featuring dancers Hallie D. Glickman-Hoch ’12, Monique M. Takla ’14, and Leah R. Weiss ’14. Set to Olivier Messiaen’s “Quartet for the End of Time,” this dance was made up of fluid movements effortlessly synchronized between the three dancers. The work built emotional resonance as it progressed by playing with the tension between balance and freefall, a recurring motif in this production’s repertoire. However, the motif did not detract from HRMDC’s entertaining unpredictability: the piece “When Strength Fails,” an all-male dance that juxtaposed strong action and graceful stillness, ended with a dramatic collapse.
The grande finale of “35” was “Communion,” choreographed by Salena M. Sullivan ’12. At the climax of the piece, dancer Bridget D. Scanlon ’15—with only the briefest look of trepidation on her face—fell backwards from the shoulders of a fellow dancer into the waiting arms of her company colleagues. Like much of the rest of “35”, the scene was inventive, spirited, and successfully executed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Award-winning playwrights and friends Matthew M. Lombardo and Charles L. Busch were a dynamic pair in their lecture last Friday at the Loeb Drama Center. Sponsored by the American Repertory Theater and the Moscow Art Theatre, the two artists spoke with Harvard students about how to cultivate a career in the world of theater and the parallels in their current work. Busch’s “Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,” which ran for five years, is one of the longest running plays in Off-Broadway history; his work “The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife” received a Tony Award nomination for Best Play. Lombardo is the author of Off-Broadway hit “Tea at Five,” starring Kate Mulgrew, and Broadway hit “Looped” starring Valerie Harper.
This season, both artists are presenting shows in Boston that portray the lives of nuns, but through vastly different perspectives. Busch’s new work, “The Divine Sister”—which is running at the Calderwood Pavilion until November 19—takes a comedic perspective on Hollywood’s portrayal of nuns. Lombardo’s new work “High”—which will run from December 6 through 11 at the Cutler Majestic Theatre—stars actress Kathleen Turner. She plays Sister Jamison Connelly, a nun whose faith is tested when she serves as a rehabilitation counselor for a young drug addict. The Harvard Crimson interviewed both artists after their lecture to learn more of their friendship, and the depiction of nuns in their newest works.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you two first meet?
Matthew M. Lombardo: In a bathhouse in San Francisco.
Charles L. Busch: Actually, I think we met in a hot tub in L.A. But I don’t recall.
MML: He doesn’t recall, but it was the San Vicente Inn in West Hollywood, California.
CLB: It was a somewhat loose gentlemen’s hotel of ill repute.
MML: Actually, it so happened that [Busch] was showing the play “Die, Mommie Die” at the Coast Playhouse [in West Hollywood], and my play—“Mother and Child” with Ann Wedgeworth—was following his. So we were staying at the same hotel—and that’s where we first met.
CLB: Then just a year ago, when I was doing “The Divine Sister” in New York, [Lombardo] and I connected again through a talented director named Robert Ruggiero. Matthew was working with Rob and I knew Rob socially. They both came to see “The Divine Sister,” and we went out to dinner afterwards. We hit it off again, like a house on fire.
THC to CLB: Though “The Divine Sister” is a comedic take on the Christian tradition, does your portrayal contain a deeper meaning?
CLB: I’m Jewish [but] I was really raised with no religion at all—so my only awareness of Catholicism is through the movies. [“The Divine Sister”] is not [a] satiric indictment of the church. Though I may make some satiric jabs, what I am really doing is celebrating the excesses of Hollywood’s treatment of religion over the past 75 years. Along the way, I do make some points about latent anti-Semitism in the Catholic Church and their feelings about gay issues, but the basic point is that I am making fun of Hollywood religiosity.
THC to MML: Many of your most famous plays portray iconic women, Katharine Hepburn in “Tea at Five” and Tallulah Bankhead in “Looped.” Why did you decide to write about the fictional nun Sister Jamison Connelly in “High”?
MML: Well, I got the reputation of writing light, fluffy comedies. After having gone through a seven-year, harrowing crystal meth addiction, I felt that I was a different person—a different writer than I was when I wrote [“Tea at Five” and “Looped”]. The life experience [of the addiction] was gnawing at me to get out, so I wanted to write something very different [and] very personal. I wanted to expose myself as a writer like I never had before. So [in writing about Sister Jamison Connelly] I wrote a play about the challenges of addiction, alcoholism, and enabling.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A trio of singing midgets, a live pianist pounding away at a keyboard, and a dizzying strobe light seem to have no place in a play by Henrik Ibsen, a Norwegian dramatist and one of the most celebrated playwrights of the nineteenth century. Yet Lee Breuer’s “Mabou Mines DollHouse”— an adaptation of Ibsen’s proto-feminist work “A Doll’s House”—includes just such elements at the Cutler Majestic Theatre this weekend, where it finished its nine-year world tour. With the male cast members all standing below four and a half feet tall, and the female actresses all towering at heights of six feet or more, the production makes visually apparent the absurdity of sexism, as diminutive men domineeringly control the Ibsen’s female characters. Unfortunately, these creative decisions fail to cohere into a nuanced artistic whole, and the production merely makes a mockery of Ibsen’s masterpiece.
The play focuses on the struggles of Nora (Maude Mitchell), a Norwegian housewife keeping a terrible secret from her husband Torvald (Kristopher Medina). In the first scene, Nora reveals that she she lied to Torvald early in their marriage, as he had grown deathly ill but had refused to borrow the money necessary for a health-restoring journey to Italy. In order to save her husband’s life, and protect his considerable pride, Nora arranged a secret loan, since women at the time were unable to borrow money without their husbands’ consent. Claiming the sudden windfall was inheritance from her father’s recent death, Nora whisked Torvald off to Italy, and secretly spent the ensuing years paying off her debt in small, carefully-collected sums. Nearing the end of her debt, Nora longs for financial freedom, and nearly achieves it, until her frightening creditor Krogstad (Nic Novicki) decides to seek revenge.
This particular production forgoes any attempts at realism, and instead emphasizes the theatricality of play. Breuer establishes clear narrative frames for the viewer and places great emphasis on spectacle. At the beginning of the show, a woman dressed in a floor-length evening gown walks to the center of the stage, takes a bow, and then seats herself at a piano on the corner of the stage. She proceeds to provide dramatic accompaniment for nearly every scene in the play. The pianists’ presence recalls the melodrama of silent films, which were often accompanied by live musicians when screened in cinemas.
Breuer’s exploration of sexism is most powerfully visualized through Nora, who first appears onstage as a towering blonde with a mane of loose curls and an elegant, cerulean blue silk dress with ruffles and a train. Yet the moment that Nora begins to speak, it is clear that she has been completely infantilized. She delivers all of her lines in the sing-song voice of a toddler, bouncing her way around the set as she crawls under tables and clambering into boxes. When interacting with her husband, Nora’s childish mannerisms morph into a servile dependence; when asking Torvald for a favor, she gets on her knees and crawls to him on all fours, begging for a small bit of money. Moments like these obscure the quiet strength of Ibsen’s original Nora. Though undeniably oppressed by her patriarchal environment, Ibsen’s Nora is nonetheless able to orchestrate complex legal and financial transactions and maintain a quiet inner strength, an important fact that is entirely obscured by Breuer’s interpretation of the script.
As with Nora’s oversimplified characterization, certain whole scenes of “Mabou Mines DollHouse” are performed with no attempt at subtlety—actors careen through their lines with reckless abandon and cram the visual field with violent and shocking images. In one important scene, Nora practices an Italian folk dance called the tarantella; instead of being bewitching and captivating, she dances frantically as actors rush the stage dressed as devils and begin to lash her with red whips. Amid wild shrieks and a pulsating strobe light, white sheets printed with dialogue from the script unfurl from the top of the stage, and accompany the jarring, breakneck scene with silent cries for help.
The doll motif—like Breuer’s other theatrical elements—is painfully overdone, but at least lends the work some moments of aesthetic pleasure. The entire play takes place in a life-size dollhouse adorned with roses and decorated with swaths of pastel wallpaper. With its sugary colors and teapot-top arches, the whole set piece resembles a confectionery delight. In terms of costuming, Nora and her daughter are dressed identically in royal-blue silk dresses, and each holds an oversize doll with the same matching frock. Together, the two women and their dolls range in size from six feet tall to Barbie-sized, and when viewed as a tableau, suggest a set of Russian nesting dolls.
Certainly, Ibsen’s understated play leaves significant room for artistic interpretation, and a skillful adaptation of it would thoughtfully select certain elements to enhance or reinterpret. But with its flattened, unsympathetic characters and over-the-top visual and aural theatricality, the “Mabou Mines DollHouse” fails to present any instances of creative dilation. Instead, it washes over all of the script with an unrelenting intensity that leaves Ibsen’s work sullied like a once beautiful field mercilessly trampled by a garish carnival.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1725, the Austrian composer Johann Fux wrote the parable-based instructional manual “Gradus ad Parnassum” about the composition of a fugue. “I want to come to you, venerable master, in order to be introduced to the rules and principles of music,” says the student Josephus. Josephus is aware of the responsibility he is laying on his teacher: “You are indeed taking on yourself a heavy task,” he says. ”How much care and foresight must he who would enter upon this art employ before he dares to decide, for musicians and poets are born such.” For Fux, the prospective musician has his talents predetermined at birth.
This age-old parable was dusted off for modern use in a speech on art mentorship by Israeli composer and the Walter Bigelow Rosen Professor of Music Chaya Czernowin. Czernowin teaches composition in the Music Department, but she hardly considers herself an instructor. “Oh no, you can never teach anybody how to be an artist,” she says. “You can only bring out that which is already within.” To mentors like Czernowin, pedagogy in the arts is less about technical instruction than it is about personal transformation. An artist’s work can be seen as a narrative about discovering a truth within himself, and each specific work as conveying a part of this transformation. Though the artist must decide on the arc of this transformation for himself, mentors are crucial guides along the path to conviction in one’s own work.
“TRUTH IS A FEELING”
The most fundamental task of an artistic mentor may be to aid their pupil in exploring his emotions in the greatest depth possible. The Creative Writing Program in the English Department institutionalizes mentorship in specific categories within creative writing. Students who apply to write a senior thesis in creative writing are assigned professors who write fiction, poetry, nonfiction, screenwriting, or playwriting in a professional capacity. In creative writing classes, students meet in small seminars. “I like to run the workshop so that the critiquing of each student’s original work is as productive as it can possibly be. I encourage the students to try to stay away from false praise, while at the same time being mindful of the delicacy of critiquing someone’s work,” says Briggs-Copeland Lecturer on English Darcy Frey, who teaches seminars on non-fiction writing. In Frey‘s ideal class, students would receive constructive feedback without having to worry about hurtful criticisms levied at their work. Frey believes that non-fiction pieces often reflect the feelings or beliefs of the author, and worries that seemingly impersonal criticism can have an emotional impact.
In fiction writing, a student’s emotional stake in his work is clearer. “I try to draw out my students not just intellectually, but emotionally,” says Briggs-Copeland Lecturer in fiction Amy Hempel. “I encourage the deepest level of emotion in their work. I want them to take a risk; there’s no room for being superficial.” Readers cannot connect with feigned emotion in fiction—the most successful pieces of literature often conjure up strong sentimental reactions in their audience. While there can be potential for a deep emotional connection when writing and editing these pieces, Hempel highlights that this is not always the case. “I don’t care if what my students are writing is true, but it has to have a truthfulness and feeling that is believable,” she says. For Hempel, truth is a feeling, not a fact. A writer’s ability to evoke something in a piece of writing is not necessarily connected with that writer’s having experienced that thing firsthand. Sincerity of emotion is at the forefront of what Hempel aims to impart to her students.
As such, Hempel can guide her students to discovering only the things already inside themselves. “This is not a collaboration by any means,” she says. “My job is simply to edit and guide the student as the work evolves.” The mentoring process cultivates the emotional perception of student-writers, but leads to no universal tools for good writing. Sensibility cannot be taught.
CUSTOM TAILORED
I’m chatting with both Music Department graduate student Stefan Prins and Czernowin. When I ask about the nature of Prins’s individual lessons, he glances affectionately at Czernowin. “My individual sessions with Chaya are a special combination of very serious and quite funny,” says Prins. “You know”, he says emphatically, “Chaya is the reason that I came to Harvard.” After completing a master’s class in composition analysis with Czernowin in Israel, Prins knew that he wanted to stay connected with her. “I got along with her so well and she had such interesting things to say about my music,” says Prins. “I decided that I had to take a chance and try for it.” On the topic of the individual lessons themselves, Prins describes his personal experience as a journey. “We listen to things that I’m making, and Chaya is the lens that helps me focus in on what I’m doing. By the end of a lesson, we end up in a place that we neither of us expected to be at,” he says. Czernowin smiles. “I’m a very dynamic composer. People come to me when they want to change their style.”  She pauses for a moment, and then continues. “The relationships that I have with my students are very different. Artists come in all kinds, and some artists need different things. Some artists need confidence, and some just need a wall to resist. It is in this resistance that they find out who they are,” she says. The difference between the mentor’s and student’s perspective is a constructive force in pedagogy. This very personal aspect of each lesson helps Czernowin extract emotion and creativity from her students. “Nothing is really harsh or irrelevant because we’ve set up a trusting situation in which everything can be considered,” says Timothy McCormack, another graduate student in the Music Department. Because each of the lessons is tailored to specific students, they feel more inclined to share parts of themselves that would not have shared otherwise.
Undergrads in the department have control over which music professor will be their mentor. Students in the composition program take lessons with every professor in the department for one year, and then are free to choose one of the professors to mentor them for the remainder of their time in the program. The frequency of these one on one lessons varies. “In the beginning, you have to meet every week,” says Czernowin. “You have to figure out the best way to work with a student, and everyone has to adjust. This takes time.” Initially, it may be unclear what a given student actually needs in terms of guidance.
These individual lessons are accompanied by small seminars in which students learn to analyze compositions. “The music department has been fostered very warmly by Chaya and Stephen,” says Prins. “It feels like I have a new family.” McCormack believes that this spirit of community is crucial to his learning. “I find that I really trust her, and trust is another hugely important factor in a successful mentorship,” he says. “This is because if I trust her, I’m very open to her input.” Honest interaction between the student and instructor is necessary in the search for truth in art conception.
WISER LENS
Hempel and Czernowin both have mentors who they recognize had a strong influence on their artistic style. “Gordon Lish was my mentor when I was at Columbia [University],” says Hempel. “He taught me everything that I know.” In 1985, Hempel published an article in Vanity Fair entitled “Captain Fiction” in which she details her experiences in Lish’s seminar. “He ended up publishing me, which was highly unusual,” Hempel reflects. It is not uncommon for students and their mentors to stay in touch post-graduation, but the relationship between them evolves over time. “After graduation, it becomes more of a friendship,” says Hempel. “I sometimes help their work get seen by agents and editors—it’s like matchmaking,” she says. This realm is perhaps where students need the most support.
Czernowin also holds her hold mentors in high esteem. “My oldest mentor in Israel was like family,” she says. “I’m still mostly in touch with all of my old mentors.” Mentors stay relevant in part because artists need guidance long after they complete their formal education. “Composers need support for many years because composing is a very difficult thing to do. It is especially hard to find a job as a composer these days,” Czernowin says. However, the mentor-student relationship also runs both ways. “I learn more from helping my students create than I end up teaching them,” she says. The mentorship process clarifies a teacher’s priorities for herself.
“Let me clarify,” says Czernowin. “There comes a point in time where the student must be independent. You have to learn to be your own mentor.” At first, this would seem to be a contradiction. After all, it is not uncommon for students to reach out to their former professors for support after graduation. “It is important to move on to make sure that the voice coming through the art is your own, not your mentor’s,” she says. “You need more than one perspective. It is not about the mentor, it’s about you,” she adds. In the ideal case, the mentor’s perspective on a piece does not mask or overpower the original artist’s own perspective. Rather, the mentor’s perspective provides a lens through with the student can study their work and, by contrast, determine how to proceed.
MINE THE DEPTHS
To Czernowin, teaching composition allows her to spread a mode of artistic and emotional release.  “I was 13 when I first started composing. I was going through puberty, and my music was the only way to express what I needed to say,” she says. Czernowin laughs quietly to herself, and then grows very serious. “I was playing piano at the time, and it wasn’t enough for me to play other people’s pieces. They didn’t say what I wanted them to say, what I needed them to say.” According to Czernowin, teaching art has to do with who the artist is, and how what they’re trying to say is unique. She says that mentoring is essentially about helping an artist find a voice to express those thoughts or feelings that cannot be easily communicated.
“‘Teaching’ is not a good word to use,” says Prins. “It should be something else.” Prins makes this distinction perhaps because the advice provided by Czernowin extends far beyond technical instruction. What Prins and Czernowin seek is intangible. Prins explains that he and Czernowin rarely talk about the technical aspects of a piece of music. “We work with scores and talk about passages, but that’s it. The things that we talk about are on another level—a philosophical level. It’s the search for your own language and what you want to say,” he says. To Prins, however, a good coach should not give too much advice. The coach should be nothing more than the lens through which a student can examine the personal narrative in his art. “It is like the instructor is handing you a set of keys, but you have to realize which key the lock is for,” he says.
Hempel agrees. “I’m not teaching them much, I’m merely just bringing out what they have access to in their minds and imagination,” she says. She goes on to explain that her main priority is to help her students locate themselves on a spectrum of creativity. “When they feel that they have hit a roadblock, it’s about dragging out in them what they don’t know is useful yet,” she says. The process of self-discovery is not always fluid. It is the duty of a mentor to assist the student in finding ways to express what is within them when it is not always clear how to do so.

Noel Gallagher was supposed to be the next Lennon or McCartney. He was supposed to be the next leading British statesman who would save rock from the angry, unintelligible mess that was grunge. At the very least, he was expected to be the Keith Richards of his generation. And for a couple years in the mid-’90s, he played the part convincingly, by writing brilliant songs and playing guitar for the world’s biggest rock band, Oasis. He simultaneously provided much fodder for tabloids due to his excessive partying, drug habits, and violent confrontations with bandmates. But somewhere along the road, overwhelmed by the massive fame and gargantuan expectations the world had placed on him, Gallagher ran out of steam. “I had no reason or desire to make music,” Gallagher said in an interview in August. “We should have gone to wherever it is the Rolling Stones disappear to.”
Oasis’s 1997 album, “Be Here Now,” was supposed to be a sprawling masterpiece akin to the Stones’ “Exile on Main St.,” but instead crashed and burned in its excess, and the band never recovered from its disaster. Instead of becoming timeless heroes, Gallagher and company are now relics of the ’90’s and the sometimes-forgotten genre of Britpop. “High Flying Birds,” Gallagher’s first solo project, is an attempt to reclaim his past glory. And while it is expertly written and sung, its lacks the relevance needed to help put Gallagher into the rock pantheon he was supposed to have inhabited by now. Simply put, this project is 15 years too late.
There are many things to like about “High Flying Birds.” The album clocks in at a brisk 41 minutes, and there isn’t a bad song out of 10. Gallagher’s particular expertise in writing bridges help make the songs varied and colorful. Beautiful layers of harmonies contrast nicely with sharp little guitar hooks, and the album manages to stay cohesive as a whole despite varying textures and instrumentation. Gallagher also shows off impressive vocal capacities rarely showcased in Oasis—he has a pretty falsetto as well as a vicious snarl.
Had this album been released in 1996 before “Be Here Now,” it likely would be remembered as the third canonical album in Oasis’s golden years. The best songs of “High Flying Birds” are as intelligently crafted and catchy as anything on “What’s The Story (Morning Glory).” “Dream On” has Noel’s old trademark drive and soaring vocals. It also packs a huge refrain: “You shout it out for me!” is readymade for stadium singalongs. “If I Had a Gun,” the lead U.S. single, sounds like an homage to “Don’t Look Back in Anger,” complete with shrewd melodic turns and yearning, adolescent lyrics: “You’re the only God that I will ever need / I’m holding on and waiting for the moment for my heart to be unbroken by the sea.”
Ironically, the unwavering resemblance to Oasis is also the record’s underlying flaw. After all these years, it doesn’t seem like Gallagher has matured as an artist one bit. The album seems like one long homage to Oasis’s glory years. The lyrical motif of the razor blade of “(What’s the Story) Morning Glory” makes an obvious appearance, as do the crashing waves of “Champagne Supernova” and the heavy vocal reverb of “Some Might Say.” Admittedly, the instrumentation is drastically different: the heavily distorted guitars and thrashing drums have been replaced by more tasteful strings, horns, and synthesizers. But the swampy denseness, lyrical themes, song formats, and overall sound all remain firmly entrenched in the 1990s.
While “High Flying Birds” is a certainly a testament to Noel’s songwriting prowess, his skills are undermined by the album’s lack of personality. Oasis once railed against the formulaic and predictable nature of popular music, and “High Flying Birds” displays both traits. It’s more a commodity than a piece of art. Once again, Gallagher performs admirably, but fails to live up to the enormous expectations with which he has struggled for the duration of his musical career.

When someone hears the name David Lynch, they think director. And with good reason, seeing as filmmaking is undoubtedly where Lynch has experienced the most success, with three Academy Award nominations for Best Director and another nomination for Best Screenplay. Most people would be quite surprised to hear that Lynch is also quite prolific as a musician, with numerous collaboration albums released over the past few years, with artists such as Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse. At second glance, however, his forays into music are not altogether unexpected, as Lynch is known to put enormous effort into the sound design for his films. What sets his latest album “Crazy Clown Time” apart from his previous oeuvre is that it is the first time he and his music attempt to stand on their own.
Unfortunately, without the backdrop of an illustrative film narrative or the support of another artist, “Crazy Clown Time” simply does not stand up as an album. Lynch has created an album filled with strange, confused amalgamations of artistic intent. The album is all at once bluesy, dark, electronic, self-indulgent, and ultimately confusing. Listening to the album, one gets the sense that Lynch is still writing the soundtrack to some narrative that plays out in his mind but never fully translates to the listener, and this disconnect leaves the songs lacking in purpose and meaning.
Many of the songs are simultaneously simple and without direction, like “So Glad,” where the only constant, driving presence in the song is the rudimentary drum beat. Everything else in the song is transient, the vocals are quiet and affected to point of being difficult to comprehend. “Noah’s Ark” feels virtually the same, with strange, whispered vocals over a languid, uninteresting beat. Each song only has a few lines of lyrics repeated over and over, but fails to develop at all from start to finish. This stasis robs the words of any potential power. Lynch makes the mistake of over-distilling songs into only a few elements while leaving those few elements too undeveloped to carry the songs.
The best songs on “Crazy Clown Time” are the ones when Lynch seems to put a more serious musical foot forward. “Football Game” is a welcome change of pace, with some bluesy guitar and vocals that maintain a steady presence throughout the song. “Speed Roadster” may be the high point of the album, and its strength comes from its directness. On this track, Lynch finally steps away from the theatrics of voice effects and abstraction, and sings a simple bluesy song. The listener can at last hear some of the words from a human, jilted lover when Lynch sings “I got fucked by you / Fucked real bad / Maybe you’re happy / But I hope you’re sad.” This is much more enjoyable than the demented moans and affected clown-like rambling on the album’s titular track, “Crazy Clown Time.”
The moments on “Crazy Clown Time” when Lynch drops the pretense of concept and theatricality are the most effective moments. On tracks like “Speed Roadster,” the bluesy chords sound right at home next to the bitter words sung by a heartbroken man. Unfortunately, songs like this are the minority. For most of the album, Lynch insists on attempting to create nightmarish or just confusing sounds, instead of music. The same emotional honesty present in “Speed Roadster” are hinted at in songs like “Good Day Today” in the pensive synth notes in the background, but it is lost amid the strange electronic dance beats and robotic vocals that characterize the rest of the tracks. Lynch clearly has a musical ear, and he has put together an ambitious album in “Crazy Clown Time,” but his taste for theatrics overshadows and detracts from the music itself.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The criteria for a good Christmas album are significantly different from those that apply to a normal album. Rather than being evaluated in terms of emotional resonance, musical competence, or any other nitty-gritty details, a Christmas album is largely defined by its holistic feel—that evasive sense of holiday cheer difficult to put into words without sounding woefully generic. Justin Bieber’s third album, “Under The Mistletoe,” might not reach the impossibly high Phil Spector–levels of greatness, but its collection of covers and original songs manages to showcase all of the necessary imagery and sound required of a Christmas album, and a slew of impressive collaborations make it an enjoyable stocking stuffer.
The weakest part of “Under The Mistletoe” was evident from Bieber’s original solo affairs. They all cover the same basic premise, and at least four of the album’s 15 tracks contain lyrics about how a female companion is the only thing the Bieber needs for the holidays. On the album’s understated, acoustic opener, “Only Thing I Ever Get For Christmas,” the 17-year-old croons, “You’re the single item on my list / You’re my one and only Christmas wish.” On the album’s lead single, “Mistletoe,” he forgoes playing in the winter snow in order to wait under the mistletoe. On “Christmas Eve,” a piano-laden slow jam, Bieber insists, “I don’t need no presents, girl / You’re everything I need.” It’s not hard to guess the main gist of “All I Want Is You,” the album’s final original song.
And yet, for all of the lyrical stagnation, the original songs still attain an aural aesthetic that can only—and perhaps unimaginatively—be described as Christmas-y. Sleigh bells abound on nearly every track, and church bells add a sense of weight to the swelling choruses of “All I Want Is You” and “Mistletoe.” It’s as if Bieber is holding up a sign reading “This is a Christmas song” in big, bold letters. But then again, for a genre that has never been known for its subtlety, this blunt approach is more charming than problematic.
The real meat of the album can be found in Bieber’s collaborations with other hip-hop and R&B artists. The Canadian Wonder harmonizes well with mentor Usher on an admirable cover of “The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire),” which is weighed down only by an ugly and out of place guitar solo. Mariah Carey accompanies Bieber—or rather, Bieber backs up Mariah Carey—on a re-recording of “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” an enormous part of the modern Christmas canon and a song originally released when Bieber was less than a year old. To her credit, Carey’s performance sounds nearly identical to that of the original single, and to his, Bieber delivers a tastefully understated verse.
Boyz II Men, who released their first album three years before Bieber was even born, feature on R&B ditty “Fa La La.” The proven harmonizers add feelings of significance to seemingly empty lines like “Wanna put my ear to you chest, girl … Baby, I hear melodies / When your heart beats.” Sure, it might be the stuff of standard pop music, but the combination of young and relatively old manages to sell it.
But the best guest appearance comes on “Drummer Boy” as Busta Rhymes adds to a cacophony of disparate elements that have no right working together as well as they do. Following an earnest intro performance of “Little Drummer Boy,” Justin Bieber launches into a rap verse featuring such unintentionally narcissistic lines as “Playin’ for the king / Playin’ for the title / I’m surprised you didn’t hear this in the Bible.” And he nails it.
But that pales in comparison to Busta Rhymes’s verse, in which he recounts the origin tale of his collaboration with Bieber. All of this is recited in Busta Rhymes’s characteristic snarl, which is completely incongruous alongside lyrics about “eggnog with a sprinkle of vanilla” and a seasonally appropriate closing line of “Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, Happy Hanukkah!” On paper, the collaboration should not work at all, and yet the duo sells it completely through sheer conviction.
It would be easy to point to Bieber’s youthful voice and decry him as the unwanted resurrection of the ’90s boy-band style. But as his numerous collaborations on “Under The Mistletoe” make clear, Bieber aims to move into the hip-hop and R&B space. With a solid holiday release under his belt, it’s a welcome transition for the evolving teen sensation.

Last February—like Occupy Wall Street this fall—Madison, Wisconsn erupted into furious political struggle whose ripples were felt across the nation. Workers and activists from all walks of life gathered in the state capital, prepared to make their last stand. Underscoring the importance of the situation, Democratic state Senate Minority Leader Mark F. Miller told the protesters that they were fighting “to protect democracy.” In a way, and not one that he intended, Miller was right. “Freedom,” Ronald Reagan said, “is never more than one generation away from extinction.” Yet the next generation of the United States is currently wasting its great potential in failing American public schools. They are waiting not for superman but for elected officials to save them and their teachers from the suffocating grip of teachers unions.
After the passage of Governor Scott K. Walker’s controversial budget that ended collective bargaining rights for public workers, the state did not revert back to a 1950s state, before public unions (and, apparently, democracy) existed. Instead the remarkable happened—budgets were balanced. In the Kaukauna School District, the new law allowed school officials to transform a $400,000 deficit into a $1.5 million surplus without draconian cuts or even cuts to teachers’ salaries. Teachers now have to pay two percent more for their healthcare coverage and actually contribute to their pensions. Previously, the school district was required by the teachers union to buy health insurance from Wisconsin Education Association Trust, which just happened to be created by the teachers union. WEA Trust had previously significantly increased the cost of premiums, which held until, after the budget passed, when the premiums suddenly plummeted.
With its sudden surplus, the school district was able to reduce the size of all classes to 26 students in high schools and 23 in middle schools. More teachers and time can now be devoted to troubled students, and best of all, the district can hire new teachers, creating jobs.
The striking results of Governor Walker’s bill put the spotlight on where each side stands in the battle over America’s schools. Teachers unions and many of their Democratic allies believe that schools exist to provide jobs to teachers. As former American Federation of Teachers President Al Shanker so simply stated, “When school children start paying union dues, that’s when I’ll start representing the interests of school children.” Republicans and school districts believe that schools exist to provide a quality education to their students.
A quality education is impossible to provide without excellent teachers, but teachers unions are against those, too. By insisting that teachers be granted tenure regardless of ability, unions create a system of “last in first out.” During difficult times and budget cuts, the newest teachers, regardless of their records of success, receive the pink slips. Without teachers unions, the best teachers stay, and the lemons receive the opportunity to find new, more suitable careers. Unions create barriers to entry and oppose alternative teacher certification programs. Despite its popularity and success, the National Education Association this summer decided to denounce Teach for America. Without unions, promising college graduates and mid-career professionals can devote their lives to helping students.
The public education system is failing, not because of a lack of effort but because of a lack of priorities. When unions are placed first, teachers, students and parents are placed last. Unions cost school districts millions of dollars in teachers’ pensions, healthcare, and union dues, and, in exchange for all of those valuable taxpayer dollars, ensure that millions of children are placed in dropout factories with failing teachers. It’s time to turn the tables on unions and grade teachers the same way they grade their students: by performance.
The status quo of American education is completely deficient in stewardship of students and respect for the dignity of workers, principles central to conservative thought but by no means exclusive to it. For every child to be guaranteed a decent education, liberals and conservatives must (and can) embrace the principles of school reform together. If America’s schools want to stop their fall in international rankings, government leaders must erode the power of unions through the end of collective bargaining rights if necessary. Unions have demonstrated they are willing to sacrifice the students and good teachers of this nation for the security of extravagant pensions and benefits. Democrats cheered last winter when Obama stated that he wanted to “win the future.” America’s future is waiting—in the classroom. They can’t wait to be given the chance to succeed.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UC President Senan Ebrahim ’12 has dedicated his presidency to advocating for a greater level of student-faculty communication.  Last year, the UC passed his signature piece of legislation calling for the creation of the Harvard University Forum for Change, which would entail two hour-long meetings between students, faculty, and administrators per semester.  To the end of advancing the goal of heightened student-administrator communication, on Oct. 23, the UC hosted an open forum with Harvard College Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds, Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Michael D. Smith, and President Drew G. Faust.  The discussion was limited to the oft-discussed issue of campus social space and the thoroughly uncontroversial question of secondary fields.  We are grateful to the UC for setting up this meeting, since the average student suffers from an unfortunate lack of access to administrators.  While this meeting was far from perfect, we believe that many of its weaknesses will lessen upon repetition.  Whatever imperfections prevented this most recent forum from being fully effective ought not dissuade the UC from continuing to pursue the goal of heightened student-administrator communication.
It’s clear that the Oct. 23 forum was far from perfect.  Roughly half in attendance were UC representatives, suggesting that the audience was not the cross-section of the student body many would have hoped.  Additionally, the topics discussed (social space and secondary fields) were too uncontroversial to generate productive and meaningful discussion.  While Harvard students do care about social space, the tenor of the discussion was far from the kind of frank productive discourse conducive to a healthy student-administrator relationship. Furthermore, the administrators’ lack of forthrightness in their answers to student questions precluded the kind of open dialogue that we all hope to see in the future Forum for Change.
However, despite these flaws, the student body on the whole benefitted from the chance to meet with administrators.  We think that this type of mega-office hour is a worthwhile medium for students to speak their mind. After all, the single hour per semester that Dean Hammonds and President Faust offer for office hours is far from sufficient—especially considering that there have been occasions on which this small attention has been canceled due to the administrator’s scheduling conflicts.
While we fully support the UC’s effort to improve administrator-student relations, we would also like to impress upon our elected representatives the importance of the small-yet-tangible changes that they can and have achieved that improve students’ lives.  Past UC accomplishments like the restaurant discounts instituted earlier this year have created demonstrable benefits for Harvard Undergraduates.  Larger attempts at systemic change should not come at the expense of the “bread-and-butter” accomplishments that we as students expect and enjoy.
At the end of the day, the current system of student-administrator communication—centered around a handful of committees with largely UC reps sitting on them—is just not enough.  While we understand that President Faust serves the entire University community, Dean Hammonds ought to make more of an effort to seek student opinion in a systematic way.  Participating in more meetings like the one on Oct. 23 would be a great way to achieve this goal, especially if it leads to the realization of UC President Ebrahim’s Forum for Change.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The passing of Dr. James Yannatos, former conductor of the Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra, marks the end of an era. Dr. Y, as his students affectionately called him, oversaw one of Harvard’s largest and one of America’s oldest musical institutions, leading the group in rehearsals and concerts for over 45 years.
It is striking to consider the number of distinguished academics who came through the HRO during Dr. Y’s tenure. The Boston Globe, for example, points out that one year, Harvard Medical School Professor Norman Letvin sat next to Nobel Prize-winning economist Eric Maskin in the clarinet section. Perhaps even more staggering, however, is the corresponding roster of professional musicians. Cellists Yo-Yo Ma and Matthew Haimovitz, composer John Adams, and pianist and Harvard Professor of Music Robert Levin—just to name a few—all performed with Dr. Y in one form or another. Even the current New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert once served as Dr. Y’s assistant conductor.
This impressive list is a testimony to the fruits of Dr. Y’s recruiting efforts. As The Crimson has pointed out, at the time Dr. Y assumed his position, the HRO was but an “eclectic congregation of a few undergraduates, alumni, and affiliates who were able to play instruments”—a far cry from the 90-person symphonic orchestra of underaged virtuosi it is today.
Given the significant increase in both the number of players and the quality of playing that the HRO saw during the Yannatos era, the questions follow: Where does it go from here, and how should musical life at Harvard change in response to the enormous influx of technically gifted musicians into its academic ranks?
Curiously, it seems as though Harvard has in large part ignored this question. For years, a conspicuous divide has existed between the music department and the music students. The department, whose focus has traditionally been the theoretical and historical aspects of music, has remained aloof with regards to student performances. It provides little financial and logistical support for students who are not music concentrators. Exacerbating this situation is the fact that the vast majority of Harvard’s performing musicians are not music concentrators, specifically because the department does not make musical performance its priority.
The end result of this feedback loop has been the spawning of a vast number of entirely student-run musical groups on campus. Truth be told, this is a rather endearing quirk of Harvard’s musical scene. Being produced and directed entirely by students, groups like the Bach Society Orchestra and the Dunster House Opera are not as likely to be found on other college campuses. The autonomous nature of these groups has undoubtedly contributed significantly to the development of its constituent musicians. Yet the lack of an institutional backing for these students remains a notable disadvantage, especially considering the amount of musical guidance the modern-day conservatory student receives.
The Office for the Arts at Harvard has taken steps to fill this gap in Harvard’s musical world, providing monetary grants such as the Artist Development Fellowship and arranging master classes for students by world-class musicians, such as soprano Renée Fleming and pianist André Previn. But the OFA’s efforts are sporadic and fail to provide the constant stream of support required by serious students of music.
There are numerous ways in which Harvard could implement additional conduits of study for music students. Hiring more faculty members who are performing musicians and offering more courses in musical performance are two of the most obvious ways. When Professor Robert Levin retires in the spring of 2013, it will be critical to find not only a brilliant musical thinker, but also a consummate performer, to replace him as the instructor of one of Harvard’s best classes, Chamber Music Performance and Analysis. Harvard could also rekindle its long-standing relationship with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and gain students access to BSO rehearsals as the Juilliard School has done with the New York Philharmonic. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Harvard should provide more of a framework for aspiring musicians to pursue their career goals. While the Office of Career Services provides thousands of listings in investment banking, consulting, and engineering, it offers few if any options for those wishing to become professional musicians. Of course, a career in the arts is inherently less defined than those in other fields, but the present complete dearth of guidance is troubling.
Such additions to the life of the undergraduate musician would provide an invaluable counterpoint to the already-excellent academic aspects of Harvard’s musical scene. Cooperation between the music department, the OFA, and the students,would ensure that excellent music would not just be seen and thought about, but also heard and played. Given how much Harvard excels in other fields and the overabundant talent of its music students, there is no reason it should not become one of the nation’s leading musical institutions.
Yuga J. Cohler ’11 is currently a master of music student in orchestral conducting at Juilliard School.

“Money for jobs and education, not for banks and corporations!” chanted students from colleges around the Boston area this past Wednesday in a citywide walkout and protest affiliated with Occupy Boston.  In recent years, state and national governments have cut funding for public higher education.  As a result, schools have increased tuition and fees and decreased financial aid, making college education inaccessible to many low-income students.  These rising prices have contributed to mounting American student debt, which now exceeds a trillion dollars and is larger than total US credit card debt.  These impediments to education are part of a broken economic system in which the wealthiest one percent profit off the labor of the 99 percent.
This is the context in which we helped organize the student walkout from Professor Mankiw’s Economics 10. Those of us who walked out stand in solidarity with students (and those who would like to be students) nationwide who cannot access the ladders of opportunity that supposedly permeate the American meritocracy.  The walkout should be seen in the context of Occupy Boston and the Occupy movements nationwide, which seek to curb the trends of rising income inequality and concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few over the past thirty years.  We believe that Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, a former economic advisor to President Bush, played a key role in creating the policies which have exacerbated economic inequality and led to financial instability and collapse.   We argue that it is unfair that he teaches this foundational course, which greatly impacts the attitudes of Harvard students, every year.
Unfortunately, debate around the normative parts of economics is severely deficient in Economics 10.  This lack of debate is apparent in the way in which we are taught about key economic and policy principles.  For instance, Professor Mankiw argues in his textbook, Principles of Economics, that equity and efficiency in the economy are “two goals [which] often conflict.” Our professor believes that progressive taxation sacrifices economic efficiency (total wealth) for the benefit of more economic equality. However, mounting evidence suggests that “the trade-off between efficiency and equality may not exist” and that excessive inequality leads to negative consequences in the economy over the long run in terms of economic efficiency.
Professor Mankiw also presents a biased view on minimum wage.  In his textbook, he contends that a minimum wage causes a surplus of labor supply and thereby leads to unemployment.  While this statement might seem sensible based on simplified graphs, it is not necessarily true in real life. For instance, a comparative study of the fast-food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania found that increasing the minimum wage did not decrease employment levels; notable economists including Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz have confirmed these results.  While some have made the argument that Ec 10, as an introductory course, cannot delve into nuance, simplicity used in the service of ideology inhibits students’ intellectual growth.
Similarly, Professor Mankiw asserts an uncritically supportive position on free trade, believing it beneficial for the economic development of all countries. While free trade often yields positive results, trade issues are complex.  The world’s most developed countries have utilized various forms of government intervention in the market to grow their industries.  Also, the World Bank and IMF’s Structural Adjustment Programs, implemented during the 1980s and 1990s, which required indebted developing countries to completely open their markets to free trade policies in order to receive loans, failed on several counts.  As Rick Rowden explains in Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism, Structural Adjustment Programs led to worse health outcomes, increased poverty, and decreased economic growth.  By neglecting to mention the real-world effects of free trade policies, Professor Mankiw encourages students to view economics in terms of oversimplified models rather than in terms of actual people and issues.
Discussion and debate are some of the most important aspects of a liberal arts education.  Yet, while such discourse is prominent in the scholarly economic community, it is largely missing from Ec 10.  Many critics of the Ec 10 walkout have argued that this action was tantamount to attacking ideological freedom in universities.  However, the point of the walkout was not to silence conservative viewpoints, but rather to protest Professor Mankiw’s monopoly over the presentation of economics to over 700 students with little experience in the field every year.  We hoped that the walkout would stir debate among the student body about the issues that the Occupy movement raises, such as economic inequality.  A broad liberal arts education should encourage students to think critically about what their professors teach, but Ec 10 does not promote such analysis.
Activism is a natural outgrowth of the liberal arts principles of critical thinking and a free exchange of ideas. Students should be encouraged to learn about and debate important issues, develop a vision of a better world, and then, as Mahatma Gandhi said, “be the change they seek.” Thus, we hope that the Ec 10 walkout, a political action with its roots in intellectual concerns, will help advance the causes of economic justice and open discussion.

A team of Harvard researchers led by Associate Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Tobias Ritter developed a new chemical method that refines the capabilities of 3D internal bodily imaging.
The new method expands on the scope of current imaging technology by allowing greater access to the radioactive positron-emitting “tracer” molecules used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET), a form of nuclear imaging. Under conventional methods, the making of the bonds within the common tracer molecules as well as the tagging and labeling of these molecules have typically presented a challenge.
“I wouldn’t go as far as to say it was impossible but it was definitely challenging to make these bonds with conventional fluorination methods, especially due to the reactivity of the fluoride anions,” Ritter said.
The chemical development, which has been going on for almost five years, was done at Ritter’s Lab at Harvard. Work relating to the radiochemistry and nuclear imaging was conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with Professor Jacob M. Hooker, assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.
“What’s distinctive about this work is the role of the new method as an enabling technology,” Hooker said, “It will be able to enable many more compounds to be labeled with a positron-emitting isotope.”
The new method overall will increase access to PET radiotracers, which could lead to the development of new molecules for use in a variety of medical applications. In particular, these developments could assist in the evaluation of pharmaceutical candidates to accelerate drug development.
The research team hopes to increase the accessibility of the new method to both research institutions, as well as patients.
“This method is relatively easy but not necessarily practical. In the next iteration, we have to make it simpler so users aren’t intimidated by it,” Hooker said.
The team also plans to identify tracer molecules that could make a difference in human PET Imaging, possibly involving imaging techniques regarding pathways in the brain.
“Having access to this technology will help us identify specific problems that we can tackle in the future,” Ritter said.

Dan Barber, a chef and owner of the Blue Hill restaurants in New York and a prominent writer on food and agricultural policies, urged his listeners to become picky eaters.
In a speech in the Science and Cooking lecture series on Monday, Barber asked his audience to demand the high-quality flavors that he said can only be produced by local farms using sustainable methods.
“For the most part, in the last 100 years or so, we have killed flavor,” Barber said.
This “death of flavor,” Barber said, is caused by the chemical additives, particularly fertilizers, which are used extensively in modern food production.
Barber emphasized the importance of natural microorganisms in soil, which help develop healthier produce with better flavor. In a natural cycle, matter that is decaying in the soil is consumed and then excreted by numerous organisms until it is eventually broken down into very refined nutrients that plants can absorb from the ground, Barber said.
Not all of those nutrients can be replaced by synthetic fertilizers, according to Barber.
He also said that animals that graze in the wild grow to be more flavorful than those that dine on cheap feed.
These ideas are put into practice at Stone Barns, an 80-acre farm in New York which supplies much of the food used at Barber’s restaurants. Fifty acres of its forests are set aside for pigs to forage for their own food.
At the lecture in the Science Center, Blue Hill’s Culinary Director Adam Kaye held up a rotund pig leg raised at Stone Barns. Prepared as speck, a type of ham, the meat had been cured with salt, juniper, and rosemary, then smoked for five days.
“Absolutely delicious,” said Quicia Davis, a healthy eating specialist at Whole Foods, as she tasted the meat. “You can definitely taste the love and the care in the speck.”
Harold McGee, who wrote the textbook used in the “Science and Cooking” course, introduced Barber to the audience.
“We’re on the verge of a renaissance in farming,” McGee said. “Dan Barber and Stone Farms have been real pioneers in this movement.”
Yet audience members questioned whether production methods like Barber’s are feasible on a large scale due to their high costs.
Current farming practices are designed for high yield, which often conflicts with a chef’s quest for good flavor, Barber acknowledged.
But he argued that sustainable farming could become the less costly option in the long run, since fertilizer production relies on fossil fuels—an increasingly scarce resource.

While interviewing bestselling author and essayist Joan Didion on Monday night, discussion moderator Christopher Lydon noted a paradox.
“You write so well, hard, and precisely about frailty,” he told Didion. “How do you reconcile this with your role as a powerful woman?”
Though Didion has been acclaimed as one of nation’s best writers of creative nonfiction, she demurred.
“I don’t actually feel that way,” she said. “That’s a lovely thing to say. Thank you.”
Didion spoke at a sold-out event sponsored by the Harvard Book Store at First Parish Church which was geared toward promoting her new book “Blue Nights.”
Lydon described the book, a memoir about Didion’s loss of her daughter Quintana Roo Dunne, as “a remarkably written book that seeks out and exposes the fault lines in the human condition.”
Didion, who received an honorary degree from Harvard in 2009, read several passages from the book and answered questions from audience members about her work and her mourning experience.
Her daughter died just weeks after Didion completed the manuscript of her memoir “The Year of Magical Thinking”—about her husband’s sudden death.
One audience member asked about Didion’s experience writing very publicly about these painful private events.
Didion replied that, unlike other authors, she sees no distinction between private and public narratives.
“There is no difference in my mind,” she said. “If you want to be a writer, you have to write for other people as well as yourself.”
Another attendee said in her question that she normally associates a “code of silence” with grief.
“Well, obviously I didn’t buy into this code of silence. I kind of—talked,” Didion responded, drawing laughs from the crowd.
“I was surprised by how funny she was. I really enjoyed it,” Julia F. P. Ostmann ’15 said.
A long line of people waited for Didion to sign their copies of her books after the event, hoping to speak to her about her experiences  and writings.
“She’s my favorite writer. She’s the only professional writer that’s ever made me cry,” Hayden Wright, a student at Emerson College, said after getting his book signed. “I like her candor, her sparse but elegant style of writing. She’s a very efficient writer”.
Attendee Susan Coyne, a graduate of Bowdoin College, said that she admires Didion’s work for “her precision.”
“Her writing is about absence. It informs her work as much as the words she chooses do,” Coyne said.
Asked whether she plans to write similar books, Didion said, “I don’t want to write any more memoirs.”
“I want to do something else. Maybe I’ll discover something,” she said. “Maybe it’ll be something about water. That’s always interested me a lot.”

A Harvard University Police Depart spokesperson says that recent demands from the union representing Harvard’s police force compelled the University to lay off two officers in order to make room in the budget to accommodate the cost of the union’s requests.
The two officers were laid off last week.
Harvard recently lost an arbitration regarding employees’ payment and benefits with the Harvard University Police Association, the union which represents the police.
The negotiations involved almost $500,000 worth of wages and benefits, according to David Holway, the head of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, an umbrella organization of police officers.
The University said Monday that changes in union demands necessitated the layoffs.
“The Harvard University Police Department was forced to lay off two police officers on November 1, 2011, as a result of changes to shift assignments that were sought by the union that represents our officers,” HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano explained in an emailed statement. “The HUPD administration attempted to work out an arrangement with the Harvard University Police Association in order to avoid the lay-off but an agreement could not be reached.”
Catalano said Monday that the loss of two officers will not jeopardize campus safety.
“The positions eliminated do not affect current patrol operational levels and will not have an impact on the public safety of the University,” Catalano wrote.
But members of the Student Labor Action Movement voiced concern over the possible repercussions of laying off police officers.
“Anyone who goes to Harvard knows about the muggings that happen every couple weeks,” SLAM member William P. Whitham ’14 said. “SLAM is against all lay-offs, but you might argue that they’re the last people who should be laid off.”
Karen A. Narefsky ’11, also a member of SLAM, said, “I’m very disappointed to hear this. I hope that this is not a sign of more to come.”
Catalano wrote that the University is working with the union in hopes of avoiding further layoffs.
HUPA representatives could not be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ph.D students Alison L. Hill and Daniel I.S. Rosenbloom ’05 received a $100,000 “Phase I” grant for global health research from Grand Challenges Exploration, a program launched by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to fund solutions to health issues in the developing world.
Hill and Rosenbloom, under the direction of Professor Martin Nowak in the University’s Program for Evolutionary Dynamics and in conjunction with other graduate students at Johns Hopkins Medical School, are working to develop a mechanism that can destroy dormant cells infected with Human immunodeficiency virus. This advancement would resolve the primary constraint of currently available anti-viral therapies: they can only attack viruses when they are replicating and cannot target “latent” or hidden viruses that are dormant in infected cells.
“The trouble is that latently infected cells look essentially like healthy cells, and no known mechanism is able to target and destroy them,” Rosenbloom said.
If a patient stops therapy, even temporarily, the virus can survive in these latent reservoirs and begin to replicate again, forcing patients to continue expensive drug therapy for the rest of their lives.
“Patients in developing nations may not even have access to this therapy,” Rosenbloom added. “A cure would eliminate the need for the current expensive treatment model.”
Hill and Rosenbloom have proposed gene therapy as a possible mechanism to deliver a “wake-up call” to latently infected cells, using an HIV-manufactured protein called Tat to trigger the cell out of dormancy and begin replication. This allows for current HIV drugs to target and hopefully eradicate the virus.
According to Hill, the nature of the treatment will pose unique challenges in its administration because it is reliant upon gene therapy, which has not previously been used as a form of therapy. Hill and Rosenbloom said that they hope that they will be able to demonstrate that their gene therapy vector can target and destroy latently infected cells in vitro by next year in order to support the possibility that there is a cure for the disease.
“Our goal is to eradicate all of the latently infected cells, not just 99 percent of them,” Rosenbloom said. Otherwise, he said, “Our approach will not be a complete cure, though it will nonetheless be an important step to achieving one.”
No matter the difficulty, he said it was a necessary undertaking.
“Even if a cure may not be a feasible goal at this point, our generation has a responsibility to more than 30 million living with HIV and nearly 2 million dying each year to at least try our best.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A third party candidate might have a much better shot at winning the 2012 presidential election than most citizens believe, experts in campaign media and communications said at the Institute of Politics on Monday.
The speakers identified Americans’ growing discontent with Washington partisanship and gridlock in Congress as factors that make a third party ticket more viable.
“People always say about a third party when we bring this up, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to happen,” said Mark McKinnon, former chief media advisor to President George W. Bush’s campaigns and a fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School. “Just because it hasn’t happened in American politics doesn’t mean it won’t now.”
Karen E. Tumulty, a political correspondent for the Washington Post, said that principles matter to today’s voters more than party membership.
“It feels like the center of gravity of politics has changed,” Tumulty said.
She noted that the Consumer Confidence Index, which measures citizens’ outlook on the economy, is currently at a low which it last reached in 1980 and 1992—both years in which an incumbent president was thrown out of office.
Each of those years also saw campaigns by significant third party candidates: John B. Anderson in 1980 and H. Ross Perot in 1992.
But McKinnon said that a 2012 third party option might fare even better than Perot, who garnered 19 percent of the popular vote in 1992, because confidence in government today is lower than it was 20 years ago.
A recent poll by New York Times/CBS found that 89 percent of Americans say they do not trust the government.
Kahlil Byrd, CEO of an organization called Americans Elect which hopes to put a third party candidate selected by online pollees on all state ballots in 2012, pointed out the increasing influence of technology on elections.
Byrd, a 2003 Kennedy School graduate, identified ballot access as the most significant barrier for prospective third party candidates. By helping nontraditional candidates overcome this barrier, he said he hopes Americans Elect will lead many more citizens to seriously consider a presidential run.
David M. Hafferty ’13, who leads a Harvard branch of Americans Elect, said he hopes to extend the organization’s prominence on campus by sending emails and speaking to students.
“This panel got me thinking there may be some better way to elect our politicians so we aren’t as frustrated in the future,” said Jackson F. Cashion ’13, an IOP Forum staffer who is also an inactive Crimson editor.
McKinnon forecasted that more candidates who have not yet declared their intent to run will still join the 2012 presidential field.
“I think a lot of interesting people are going to show up.” said McKinnon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren has spent the past two months campaigning across the state in her bid for the U.S. Senate, but she visited the Office of Career Services on Monday not to recruit voters but to recruit workers.
Warren spoke to students interested in working for the newly-established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency which she helped found in Washington last year.
“The CFPB really is the coolest place ever in the world,” Warren said. “It is such an important part of the government.”
The CFPB, which aims to enforce consumer finance law and educate consumers, was created in 2010 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in reaction to business practices on Wall Street which many have blamed for the 2008 financial crisis.
Warren, who specializes in consumer protection law, helped establish the CFPB and many on the left hoped that Obama would appoint her to be the Bureau’s permanent director. But anticipating Republican opposition to Warren, President Obama chose a different nominee and kept Warren on as an advisor. She recently stepped down to pursue her candidacy for Senate.
During the fledgling Bureau’s first visit to campus Monday, officials said that they hope to attract Harvard students as employees.
“Our mission is to serve, lead, and innovate,” said Ethan S. Bernstein, CFPB chief strategy officer and a Harvard Business School and Law School graduate. “This is a mandate that no one else has received: protect the American consumer in financial transactions.”
Warren described the CFPB as an independent organization with “highly credentialed people” who advise consumers or research financial regulation.
She narrated the history of consumer law dating all the way back to the Code of Hammurabi. The regulatory laws passed in 2010, she said, inaugurated a new era of consumer protection.
“We don’t have a legacy of doing this badly,” Warren said, arguing that the 2010 law gave the CFPB a blank slate to redesign regulations. “We got to build this in the aftermath of looking at history. We are building our own history and tools.... We are an agency whose point is to work for the people.”
About 30 students attended the event, where Warren spoke along with other CFPB representatives.
Alexander J. Blenkinsopp ’05-’06, a former Crimson editor, current Kennedy School student, and speaker at the event, said that while Warren is “extremely busy” as she campaigns for Senate, “I’m not surprised she made the time to speak with students about the agency. She was an inspiration to all of us at the Bureau, and that’s why alums like me came back to talk about our experience working there.”
Warren said she misses her work at the agency, which she left in the summer of 2011.
“I miss it. I miss the people—you can’t help it,” Warren said. “But I love the fact that the agency goes on without me. It’s not only a good place to be at, but it’s a good place to be from.”

India is predicted to have the third largest gross domestic product in the world in five years, according to Montek Singh Ahluwalia, India’s deputy chairman of the Planning Commission of the Government.
Between 2030 and 2035, India could experience economic growth comparable to China’s recent economic success, Ahluwalia said Monday during his talk on “India’s Growth Prospects: The Challenge of Realising Potential.”
The Planning Commission recently produced its twelfth Five Year Plan, which set a goal of achieving 9 percent growth in GDP in India.
Pre-empting any skepticism from the audience about the feasibility of this goal, Ahluwalia cited the country’s past performance.
From 2008 to 2011, industrialized countries had an average growth rate of 0.3 percent whereas India’s grew to 7.7 percent, he said.
But Ahluwalia cautioned that past performance is not necessarily an adequate indicator of what will occur in the future. He gave an examination of the Indian government’s failures, especially in the realm of poverty reduction.
“I think the official view of the government of India is that while we’ve done very well on the growth front, we haven’t done as well on the inclusiveness front,” Ahluwalia said, explaining that not everyone is experiencing the benefits of the country’s growth.
During the question and answer session, Homi K. Bhabha, director of the Mahindra Humanities Center, asked for an explanation for the deficiencies in humanities education in India.
Ahluwalia attributed the problem to a lack of funding.
“To teach humanities, you need to subsidize,” Ahluwalia said, “and unlike Harvard, we don’t have a 300-year philanthropic tradition to cash in on.”
Many of the more than 60 individuals in the audience chuckled at Ahluwalia’s response.
“He is fabulous,” said former Harvard School of Public Health Dean Barry R. Bloom. “They are very lucky to have him in India; I would welcome him to help with the United States government.”
Ahluwalia’s lecture was part of the Sixth Annual Tsai Lecture Series funded by the Tsai Lecture Fund and supported by the South Asia Initiative at Harvard.

In the Harvard women’s soccer team’s regular season finale, freshman goalkeeper Bethany Kanten showed why she and her Crimson teammates are a force to be reckoned with as they head into the 2011 NCAA tournament.
Kanten earned her second shutout of the year with two saves in the Crimson’s Ivy League title-clinching victory at Columbia on Saturday, improving her personal record to 9-2-1.
Harvard (12-4-1, 6-0-1 Ivy) took down a driven Columbia (6-10-1, 3-3-1) team, 1-0, thanks in large part to Kanten and the back line’s unyielding defense.
“Columbia had a lot to fight for,” Kanten said. “[Getting the] win was important for our mentality going into the NCAA tournament game.”
Though a tie would have still ensured the Crimson’s outright ownership of the Ivy League title, Kanten was determined to finish the season with a victory.
“Ending on a tie, we still would have won, but it’s not great for how we would have felt going into playing a big-time team next weekend,” she said.
Kanten’s first save came in the 37th minute when the Lions’ senior forward Ashlin Yahr ripped a shot from six yards out.
The Harvard keeper made a diving stop to her right to preserve the shutout.
Not only did Kanten’s save keep the Lions off the board, it also denied Yahr’s bid to tie Columbia’s all-time career goals record of 30.
“We knew she was going to be a big threat,” said Kanten of Yahr and her extra motivation to score that night. “We talked about it before the game, but we played like we would in any other situation.”
In the 52nd minute, the Lions took another shot on goal, and, once again, Kanten came up with the save, brushing off senior midfielder Natalie Melo’s attempt.
Though Columbia tallied 10 shots on the night, Harvard’s defense strengthened in the second half, not allowing another attempt on goal.
“On Saturday night, Bethany was one of our many players who played out of their minds,” freshman midfielder Mai Le said. “They were incredible. … She and our defense were the heroes of the game.”
Freshmen have played a large part in the Crimson’s success all season. It was fitting then that rookie Lauren Urke scored Harvard’s lone goal on an assist from classmate Meg Casscells-Hamby.
“It’s such a big family,” said Kanten of the team’s ability to integrate even the youngest players.
The Crimson may have depended heavily on young players at times this season, but its youth has never posed any problems.
“She plays with a maturity beyond her years,” said Le of Kanten.  “She organizes her defense and changes her style of play to suit each game’s conditions. Her ability to adapt to the game is what makes her such an exceptional goalkeeper.”
Kanten, who was named Ivy League co-Rookie of the Week in October, has been a solid fixture in the net for the Crimson during a season that has seen several goalie changes because of injury.
Junior goalie AJ Millet went down with a concussion early in the season, while sophomore keeper Jessica Wright and freshman goalie Cheta Emba have also been sidelined.
Kanten debuted in Harvard’s season opener at Long Island, finishing with two saves, and notched her first career win against Elon two days later. She opened up Ivy League play with a strong performance against Penn, coming up three stops and earning her first Ivy League Rookie of the Week award.
The freshman keeper kept it up for the rest of Ancient Eight play, finishing with a career-best nine saves against Brown on Oct. 15. Two weeks later in the Crimson’s final home match, Kanten made four stops in a 2-1 win over Dartmouth, outplaying her Big Green counterpart Tatiana Saunders, a goalie on England’s U-19 National Team.
Kanten, a native of Park City, Utah, recorded her 39th and 40th saves of the year on Saturday in her last game of a regular season in which she made 14 appearances.
Though it is in a goalie’s job description to be a leader on the field, Kanten’s teammates say they are impressed with how naturally she takes charge of the defense.
“She has stepped up to the challenge,” Le said. “She is definitely the general on the field.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard co-ed sailing team, last weekend’s regattas provided valuable experience for the upcoming spring season, as the squad sailed out of its comfort zone to compete in a racing style that it had not had much practice with this past season.
The Crimson finished ninth out of eleven teams at the team-racing-style Hap Moore Trophy at the United States Coast Guard Academy and sixth at the Mike Horn Trophy at Harvard.
Team racing, which involves multiple boats from the same squad competing together, is different from fleet racing, in which boats are scored individually. In team racing, crews not only aim to finish in the best positions possible, but also to slow the other team and prevent them from occupying the top spots.
“Team racing is really fun and exciting, especially since this was the first team racing regatta that we had this fall season,” freshman Reid Bergsund said. “The team itself has a lot of experience, but we just haven’t been practicing a whole lot of team racing. It will be really valuable when it comes to the spring, and I’m really looking forward to it.”
Fleet racing is the dominant format of the fall collegiate sailing season, so last weekend’s team racing regattas offered a preview of what the Crimson should look out for during spring competition.
Harvard’s lack of team racing experience thus far was evident, as the squad finished towards the bottom of the pack in both of the regattas that it competed in.
HAP MOORE TROPHY
Eight Crimson sailors competed in Connecticut, where Harvard finished in ninth place out of eleven teams. Tufts won the event, finishing with a 13-2 record and edging out Boston College and Roger Williams, who came in second and third place, respectively.
“College sailing is a lot more competitive than high school sailing,” Bergsund said. “I’ve loved having the chance to compete against high-level competition from schools across the Northeast. It’s been a great experience so far for me.”
The event highlighted both the most experienced members of the team as well as those newest to the collegiate sailing scene, as the Crimson squad was composed entirely of seniors and freshmen. Co-captain Brendan Kopp, senior Emily Lambert, and freshman Gram Slattery skippered for Harvard, while co-captain Alex Jumper and fellow senior William White, who is also a Crimson editor, took time at crew for the Crimson. The freshmen trio of Bergsund, Brian Drumm, and Michael Drumm each had the opportunity to compete as both skipper and crew in the Hap Moore Trophy.
In the first round-robin races on Saturday, Harvard defeated Coast Guard, Columbia, and Saint Mary’s, but lost races against Boston College, Roger Williams, Tufts, Brown, Connecticut College, Navy, and Vermont. With a 3-7 record, the Crimson qualified for the Silver fleet, which featured the bottom five performers from the initial round robin competition.
The team fared much better against these teams, avenging its loss to the Camels, and again defeating the Coast Guard Academy and the Lions.
Harvard lost only to the Seahawks to garner the ninth place finish, but the team didn’t feel it has any reason to worry.
“It was our first team race, so we weren’t too prepared,” Kopp said. “We had a ton of freshmen switching in and out to get a feel of what the team will look like in the spring.”
MIKE HORN TROPHY
The Crimson did not perform any better at the Mike Horn Trophy, as it failed to win a single race and was eliminated after the third round robin.
Harvard took sixth place out of six teams at the regatta hosted on the Charles River.
Participants competed in seemingly perfect sailing conditions for most of the regatta.
Roger Williams won the event with a record of 16-3. Tufts and Boston College rounded out the top three, finishing with 11-8 and 10-9 records, respectively.
“We’re going to try to get a lot better at that in the spring because the spring is much heavier on team racing,” Kopp said.
For now, the Crimson co-ed sailing team will focus on preparing for the Atlantic Coast Championships at by Harvard. Despite its failure to come home with a win in either of the regattas last weekend, Harvard hopes to finish its fall season on a high note.
“Next week were back to fleet racing at the [Atlantic Coast Championships],” Kopp said. “Last weekend was just a tune up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Winners of the Ivy League, meet the five-time defending champions of the America East for the second time this season.
After watching the NCAA Selection Show at the Murr Center together, the players of the Harvard women’s soccer team learned Monday that they will face the Boston University Terriers in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
The matchup is currently scheduled for this Saturday  at noon.
The first round will take place at BU’s Nickerson Field, where the Terriers have not lost since Sept. 4, 2010.
“We both have had really, really strong seasons,” Crimson coach Ray Leone said. “We knew we were going to play someone locally because that’s just the way the NCAA works. I think it’s going to be a great game, and we’ll see what happens.”
Harvard concluded conference play undefeated (6-0-1) with an overall record of 12-4-1, the first time since 1999 that the team finished with 12 wins. Boston University finished without a blemish in the America East, going 8-0 and 18-2-1 overall.
The two teams last met on Sept. 14, with the Terriers shutting out the Crimson, 3-0, at the same venue of this week’s first-round contest.
The two teams were still in very early stages of their seasons, with Leone using 24 players in the losing effort, while his BU counterpart used 23.
“It was a real game, it was all-out,” Leone said. “BU flat out beat us. They were excellent.”
The Crimson loss came at a time when Harvard was enjoying a three-game winning streak, including two 2-1 victories over Connecticut and Massachusetts.
The Huskies and the Minutewomen had beaten the Terriers before Harvard and BU met.
Both teams have a come a long way since the early-season matchup, and each squads will certainly come into the first-round contest putting everything on the line in order to extend their campaigns.
“We’re just going to have to play our style of soccer and try and keep the ball better than we did the last time, that’s for sure,” Leone said. “It’s going to be a tough challenge.”

If Harvard Business School wasn't appealing enough, there is one more reason to want to attend: Lady Gaga.
No, "Mother Monster" will not be joining Tyra Banks as the latest icon to hit the streets of Cambridge, but Gaga's meteoric rise to fame is an appealing new part of Associate Professor Anita Elberse's course, "Strategic Marketing in Creative Industries." The second-year case-study class analyzes the decisions that have made the 25-year old pop sensation into one of the most influential and successful celebrities with a net worth of over $110 million.
The course starts with an examination of defining properties of creative industries and consequences for effective marketing strategies. It ends with a consideration of firms that fall outside the core set of creative industries but face comparable challenges or opportunities.
One of the cases zeroes in on a decision Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, made in September 2009, when rapper Kanye West backed out of the large-arena "Fame Kills" tour. The case asks students to place themselves in the situation and to decide whether the New York native should continue with the big tour as a solo artist, embark on a scaled-down solo tour, or cancel the tour altogether.
"It doesn't really matter what they ended up doing, the case study is more about what are the pros and cons of each—it's to understand underlying strategies to launching artists," Elberse said to the Boston Herald.
