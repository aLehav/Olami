After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The word on the street is that a lot of the professors here, and a lot of students too, are unaware of just how much significant religious commitment exists among undergraduates at Harvard. Religious life isn't exactly the first thing that springs to mind at the mention of Harvard's name. Yet many on Harvard's campus are quite astonished to discover that “godless Harvard” is anything but.
I believe that I first truly met the Christian God at Harvard.
Though I came from an Anglican family, it was here that the old creeds and old hymns to God in the Highest first really came to life for me. Since then, I have been an active member of the Christian student community on campus. I have taken great pleasure in tracing the footsteps of the many giants of Christian thought who, for better or worse, dominated Western thought for at least a millennium. And I have urged that there be more thoughtful engagement with Christianity on this campus.
There is a gap to be filled. We are no longer in the era of Christendom, when the language of Christianity still hummed and buzzed, full of the imaginative categories that made it meaningful and alive. Today, the significant residue of Christian language and thought that is still present in our culture has largely been evacuated of its meaning—of the richness, the thought, and the feeling behind it.
So, for example, when we hear the word “sin” today, one's first thought is of Christians who “put themselves down, with writhings of unease, for perfectly normal human behavior,” as Francis Spufford puts it. The perils of fiery eternal judgement spring to mind. Either that, or we opt for some entirely watered-down, giggly concept, as in, “Aren't these chocolates positively sinful, Leticia, darling?”
Christianity has a lot more to say about the concept of sin than any of that. Sin is complex, and it involves nuanced ideas about freedom and responsibility, fear and safety, power and oppression, self-harm, abandonment, death. When properly understood, the concept of sin illuminates humankind's smallness and bigness in the world. It is above all a liberating concept.
Lose the imagination of the past and you lose the present. The effect is most clearly seen in Western literature. Marylinne Robinson, the Pulitzer-winning author of “Gilead,” has written for The New York Times on the centrality of the Bible to any understanding of subsequent Western literature. It isn't just a matter of catching the biblical allusions. Catching the intended religious feeling matters. T.S. Eliot notes that the Bible had the effect it did on Western literature “not because it has been considered literature, but because it has been considered the report of the Word of God.”
Some, trying to understand the ancient appeal of Christ, have relearned the ancient language of sin and grace, providence and glory, and found that the forms of the modern world also clicked, bright and quivering, into place under that eternal light. As the psalmist writes, and as is coincidentally the motto of Columbia, “in lumine tuo videbimus lumen.” In Your light we will see light.
Christianity is not trapped in the past. To many apparently sane modern people, the ancient faith remains as fresh as ever. For some of us, St. Augustine's almost offhandedly tender address to God, “Our hearts are restless till they rest in You,” rings as true today as it did in the fifth century.  There is needed just a little translation between the ancient and modern imagination for the conversation about Christianity in the 21st century to be fruitful.
This column takes its title from Francis Spufford's marvellous book, “Unapologetic.” Like Spufford's book, this column is an exercise in unapologetics, in two senses. In the first sense, it is not an exercise in Christian apologetics—a systematic rational defence of Christianity. In the second sense, of course, I am not very contrite.
While we're at it, this column will be an exercise in unpolitics, too. The usual treadmill of conservative social, political, and moral topics are too often just a distraction from Christianity.
Instead, this column will be the confessions of a skeptic and a mystic trying to speak truthfully and live faithfully before God. “True stories, real experiences,” as Bret and Jemaine put it. At the end of it, I expect Christ will remain a little mysterious. He remains that way to me. But that is right and good. You wouldn't want a tame religion, I hope.
Warm wishes for a chilly semester.
Et gloria in excelsis Deo.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I was scrolling through 10 shirtless, mirror selflies that I took this past semester, staring into my unabashedly hopeful face—with eyes glaring up and down my body—when I realized that I’m not special.
For the past several months, I took time off from school to be at home in Southern California. While there, I tried something new for me but familiar to most in my community: I began a “bulking” routine.
Bulking in high school usually involved the “bros” eating a lot, weightlifting, and looking as massive as male rhinoceroses with surprisingly human-like features and backwards baseball caps. For me, however, bulking meant eating a lot, weightlifting, and looking like a skinny white dude with surprisingly large nipples.
Looking through my “progress selfies” at the end, I did see that my muscles grew a little bit. But my "gainz" were modest, especially compared with my sizeable pectoral pepperonis.
And then a strange thought occurred to me: “You know what? I’m not special.”
Let me explain. When I was first admitted to Harvard, I never felt comfortable believing that I was somehow naturally smarter or harder working than my peers at home. Time and distance from home made those feelings fade a bit. Yet, as I once again compared myself to those around me this past semester, I came to realize that my place at Harvard was, to a certain extent, arbitrarily determined—just like the arbitrary differences between vain, topless, selfie SoCal Dash and the (mostly) clothed Dash at school.
At Harvard, every student is supposed to be special. We all set ourselves apart from our communities by starting a charity, inventing a new tool, or doing something else impressive while doing well in our classes.
Yet, a lot of the things that “set me apart” in high school felt like happy accidents: Two off-the-cuff emails I sent one summer led to future job opportunities and recommendations I never expected. I became president of a club at a time when no one else ran for that position. And I tried out for the track team my freshman year only because a few friends pressured me to do it.
Sure, I still had to earn those achievements. But in those examples, there’s undoubtedly an element of circumstance involved. Plus, there are other “achievements” that I never had to earn at all. I was a white male in AP classes largely filled with Asians and females. On top of that, I had some legacy at Harvard. So, as if things weren’t easy enough for a white man from a Harvard family, affirmative action and legacy preference made it so that my background actually gave me an advantage in admissions.
We all have instances where luck helped us earn admission in some way. I know plenty of people at Harvard who have felt guilty because they believe athletic recruiting, family internship connections, skin color, or other factors unfairly led to their admittance. In addition, I know kids who didn’t get admitted to any other top tier schools before getting selected by Harvard from the waitlist, calling the merits of the whole system into question. And, more importantly, I know there are many deserving people out there who weren’t so lucky.
But I think these doubts fade over time. And there’s a reason for that: Harvard wants us to believe we are special. Grade inflation makes most of us into high-achieving A or B students. Politicians and famous people travel here to give speeches, making us feel important. And administrators constantly tell us that we are truly exceptional people.
Don’t get me wrong: Feeling special is generally good. It inspires self-worth, the confidence to take risks, and an onus to make change in the world. And yet, unhampered, it can distort perspectives. At a time when inequality is on the rise and equality of opportunity is being called into question, we might forget that the meritocracy of admissions is not perfect. We might forget that a few lucky circumstances helped us arbitrarily gain an advantage over some of our peers. We might forget that Harvard still struggles with its socioeconomic diversity. And, worst of all, we may forget that we have so much to gain from those outside the Ivy League community.
After three years here, I know Harvard students are incredible people. But being at home reminded me of all the kids who could very well be in my spot. There’s a tinge of randomness that stains every admissions spot at Harvard—a tinge that must be recognized if we are to be citizens who can know and navigate the growing inequalities of our world.
Anyway, those are just some thoughts from a Harvard kid who thinks he’s special enough to write a column. If not that, at least he’s got some very special nipples.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economic growth in the European Union remains sluggish years after the 2008 recession. While individual debt-ridden countries like Greece pose a threat to eurozone viability, the overarching problem remains continent-wide stagnation. It is clear that the stringent policies of the past few years have not been effective; instead, austerity measures on failing economics should be replaced by eurozone-wide policies to reinvigorate markets.
Last month, Greece repudiated the austerity measures imposed by the European Central Bank with the election of the left-wing Syriza party, in a decisive victory against the center-right New Democracy party led by Antonis Samaras. The new Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsiparas, promptly announced the end of austerity, which was initially instituted as a condition for the 240 billion euro bailout loan from other European nations following Greece’s 2010 government-debt crisis. He also refused a seven billion euro loan installment necessary to pay off debts by August; failure to do so would likely result in Greek default on debts totaling roughly 320 billion euros.
Much of the Greek debt is held by Germany, perhaps the staunchest proponent of austerity in the eurozone. That position has not changed: Last Thursday, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble met with the new Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and rejected renegotiation of Greek debt obligations. The day before, the ECB rejected a similar offer to renegotiate.
This is a drastic mistake. By shunning Greek efforts to find an alternative economic lifeline, the ECB, the International Monetary Fund, and other eurozone debt holders risk the election of parties like Syriza throughout Europe. This political trend could cripple the eurozone and threaten the economies of countries like Germany that are, for now, fiscally and financially stable. While there is a chance that this early rebuttal will discourage the election of parties running against unpopular austerity measures with the knowledge that their political promises are unsustainable, it is not worth the economic peril of getting it wrong.
Moreover, it is clear that the current policies of austerity have not worked; in fact, the burdens have instead slowed positive economic development. Creditors demand Greece produce an annual surplus of 4.5 percent its gross domestic product. This is a significant requirement on a floundering economy that may be impossible to meet, as the continued loaning of eurozone cash for Greek deficit payments only adds to the overall Greek debt. For Greece, this obligation has done more harm than good.
Mr. Varoufakis proposes reducing the GDP surplus requirement to between one and 1.5 percent. Mr. Schauble and other debt holders should accept this proposal and devise new policies to confront what is becoming another economic crisis. Although one to 1.5 percent growth is still anemic, it is sustainable despite Greece’s dire situation. It would also send a positive message to countries such as Spain, Italy, and Portugal, who view draconian austerity measures as an economic death sentence rather than a saving grace. Simply lending Greece another seven billion euros rather than devising the new policies necessary to strengthen the European economy is unwise. Stronger European economies, like Germany, and the ECB must provide fiscal or monetary stimuli to generate growth and employment throughout the eurozone. If they succeed, the rising tide will lift all boats.

After their triumph in recent Greek parliamentary elections, the left-wing Syriza party promised either to renegotiate the terms of Greece’s bailout package or to default on debt repayment. New Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras argued that the debt payments and painful austerity program accepted by Greece as a condition of the bailout have harmed growth prospects and harmfully cut the social safety net. Within two weeks, however, Mr. Tsipras retreated, dropping his threat of debt non-payment and promising to find alternate ways of easing his nation’s perilous financial situation.
This is the right step, though it will be painful. Austerity is certainly no joyride, but the reality remains that Greece should and must continue to meet all of its financial obligations.
The burdens on Greece, though nominally imposed by the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the European Commission, are the result of decades of profligacy. As a percentage of debt-to-GDP, in 2013, Greece had the world’s third-highest debt levels (by comparison, the United States’s oft-decried debt placed 36th worldwide). Questions still exist about statistics from the late 1990s that the Greek government submitted to meet eurozone admissions criteria. Indeed, the 2008 financial crisis shook Greek financial institutions particularly hard because they were fundamentally weak in the first place—so weak, in fact, that they required the equivalent in euros of over $300 billion in bailout money.
The existence of this enormous lifeline seriously challenges Mr. Tsipras’s narrative of a weak Greece sabotaged by malicious European creditors. The Greek economy was in dire need of help and aid from its neighbors, and what's more, the rest of Europe believed that the exit of Greece from the eurozone would be calamitous for their economies. It was only natural, then, for the European Union to offer a bailout package. But given the Greek government’s past fiscal mismanagement, it was also natural to marry the bailout with conditions of austerity and reform.
While that austerity has exacerbated the human toll of a prolonged recession, these exacting conditions were necessary to both help Greece and prevent future debt crises in that nation. It would have been naïve to view the bailout as a gift of generosity; it was an agreement to provide emergency funds on the condition that Greece enacted economic reforms. Regardless of whether the Greek electorate thinks that the austerity plan is working, the country—after accepting large loans—now has a legal, financial, and moral responsibility to abide by the terms of the original agreement. It is not the obligation of other European governments to create a bailout plan as generous to Greece as possible; it is the obligation of those governments to ensure their citizens’ money is being used responsibly.
In a time of need for Greece, the rest of Europe immediately and decisively came to its aid. The bailout package, while laden with various conditions, was a vital lifeline that prevented a financial implosion in Greece. Having accrued the benefits of a solvent government and financial sector for the past three years, it would be inappropriate and misguided for Syriza to now decide to renege on Greece’s promises. Europe has done its part. Now it’s time for Mr. Tsipras to do his.

UPDATED: February 9, 2015, at 2:49 a.m.
Most Harvard schools will suspend classes and other functions Monday in the face of a storm that may drop almost two feet of snow on parts of New England, marking the second time Harvard has suspended operations due to inclement weather in two weeks.
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences canceled all Monday classes and sections and will close its libraries, according to an emergency email communication sent to FAS affiliates Sunday. The Harvard Extension School, similarly, canceled all classes, although web conferences will go on despite the weather. Administrative offices across Harvard will be closed Monday, although critical personnel are still expected to report for regular shifts, according to an emailed University weather update from Executive Vice President Katherine N. Lapp.
The Graduate School of Education, the Divinity School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Medical School, the School of Dental Medicine, the Graduate School of Design, the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the Kennedy School of Government, and the School of Public Health also canceled Monday classes. Harvard Business School canceled classes for its MBA and doctoral students, but certain executive education program courses will likely run Monday as planned.
In advance of the snowstorm, the National Weather Service issued a warning Sunday afternoon forecasting winds of 10-15 miles per hour facing the Northeast, with gusts up to 35 miles per hour. Massachusetts Governor Charles D. Baker ’79 declared a statewide snow emergency in response to the weather, but did not issue a statewide travel ban, instead asking Massachusetts residents to stay off the road. The MBTA will run on an abbreviated schedule Monday.
The storm and subsequently canceled courses prompted scheduling changes at FAS. Make-up exams that were originally scheduled for this week have been postponed until next week, according to FAS Registrar Michael P. Burke.
The deadline to add or drop a course without a fee at FAS—originally slated for Monday—has been extended to Friday.
The Harvard University Health Services Pharmacy, meanwhile, will close Monday. Regular UHS appointments are likewise canceled, according to Lassonde, although urgent care services will remain open. Dining halls will stay  “open and functioning” on Monday, and Harvard has ordered extra food, Lassonde wrote.
Shuttle services are also scheduled to operate on Monday. “We will monitor the weather, and so long as it is safe to do so, we will continue to operate,” Director of Harvard Transit and Fleet Management David E. Harris Jr. said.
Harvard last closed on Jan. 27, when blizzard “Juno” blanketed Cambridge with about two feet of snow. Harvard, however, has rarely closed for inclement weather events in the past. In 1977, former Dean of Students Archie C. Epps III joked that, “Harvard University will close only for an act of God, such as the end of the world.” More recently, 2012’s Hurricane Sandy and 2013’s winter storm “Nemo” prompted the University to close.

Members of the Harvard Teaching Campaign are hopeful that last semester’s string of departmental endorsements for smaller section sizes—as well as undergraduate support for the movement—will result in a new policy within months.
“I think our main goal is a policy change, hopefully by the end of the semester, moving forward on section size,” said Cristina V. Groeger ’08, a History doctoral candidate and an organizer of the campaign.
The movement, which seeks to have section sizes capped at 12 students, has received support from some departments in the social sciences and the humanities. According the the campaign’s website, 15 departments and committees have endorsed the cap.
Groeger said the campaign hopes to enter more serious talks with administrators this term and to secure a Faculty of Arts and Sciences vote on the issue of section sizes.
“This semester we want to focus on continuing to build the petitions and getting an FAS faculty vote of endorsement of the Teaching Campaign,” Groeger said.
The department endorsements do not guarantee change. Section sizes are determined based on a variety of factors, including funding levels and staff availability. Harvard’s top administrators have not explicitly supported the Teaching Campaign.
Harvard is not the only Ivy League school facing questions about graduate students in teaching positions. Yale recently announced changes that simplify the structure of their program but also include effective pay cuts for some students, according to the Yale Daily News.
Departmental stipends—flat sums paid to many Yale graduate students who teach during some years of their study—are not expected to change. The shift in teaching fellow procedures comes after Yale decided to fund a sixth year of study for graduate students in the social sciences and humanities.
John M. Nicoludis, a doctoral candidate in the sciences and a member of the Teaching Campaign, said he believes that Yale’s new teaching fellow structure more closely mirrors Harvard’s.
“I think Harvard has a system that looks more like the one that Yale put in place, but we do not have that pay reduction,” Nicoludis said.
Other members of the Teaching Campaign expressed support for some elements of Yale’s changes, but they also said that they are not in favor of the pay decreases that some have experienced at Yale.
“It is definitely not what we would want, because overall in general it reduces the amount of pay that teachers are getting,” Groeger said.

Administrators and planning committees at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences are continuing to outline broad goals for the eventual relocation of their school to Allston, determined to make a campus that attracts students from across the University, according to interim SEAS Dean Harry R. Lewis ’68.
The SEAS Teaching and Community Space Task Force detailed their visions for the campus in a white paper last year, writing that they are “determined that Allston will not be seen as an engineering ghetto or overflow space.” Two-thirds of the SEAS faculty is slated to move to Allston in 2019.
“The goal is that undergraduates would rather hang out, meet up, study, and do group projects at Allston than on the other side of the river,” Lewis said.
In addition to migrating many of SEAS’s educational and administrative spaces to Allston, facilities for other disciplines might appear as well. According to English Department Chair W. James Simpson, new performing arts spaces could be included in the Allston move.
“The emphasis would be on art-making and art performance, art exhibition, rather than in the first instance on teaching,” he said.
There are currently no finalized plans for the construction of such spaces, though members of the Visual and Environmental Studies department and the American Repertory Theater have expressed interest, according to Simpson.
“We are hoping other concentrations outside SEAS will also relocate around the same time that we do, so that there will be a community over there that’s more than just engineers and computer scientists,” said Robert D. Howe, chair of the task force on SEAS student life and area dean for biomedical engineering.
While the design of an attractive space for students has been central to campus planning, initial reactions to the project from some faculty members were critical.
Since then, however, more have come to appreciate the potential benefits of the move, Lewis said.
He said that since the Medical School analogously moved to Longwood in 1905, the area has been transformed from a “swamp” into a bustling center for medicine.
“I think [the] same will happen in Allston: the engineering campus will create a whole industrial zone around it, just like Kendall Square and MIT,” he said.
In addition, the move will provide needed space to accommodate the school’s growing enrollment and activity, according to Howe.
He said that as faculty members are trying to create more hands-on and project-based courses, the school is experiencing large growth in its enrollment, resulting in a shortage of teaching spaces.
Students have also contributed to developing a vision for the Allston campus. Last fall, 15 students in Engineering Sciences 96: “Engineering Problem Solving and Design Project” spent the semester addressing issues related to the relocation of SEAS to Allston. The group wrote a 256-page report detailing their recommendations for the Allston: a relaxation room, a project exhibition space, an improved shuttle system, a first-year engineering program, and a café-pub, among others.
Caroline M. Perry, a spokesperson for SEAS, was present at the interview with Lewis.

Five months after Harvard unveiled a controversial new health benefits policy for non-union employees, the University Benefits Committee that recommended the changes said it expects less than 1 percent of families enrolled in the program to reach the family out-of-pocket maximum of $4,500.
Approximately half of these families will have access to a reimbursement program established by University President Drew G. Faust designed for affected faculty and staff whose health care costs, excluding premiums, exceed 3 percent of their salaries, according to a detailed medical program fact sheet released on Friday.
The fact sheet further outlined many of the changes of the new policy and the potential impact they may have on non-union employees and on the University’s expenses.
Since the announcement of the change, faculty members have criticized the new plan for introducing a deductible at the point of care for non-routine health appointments and increasing copayments. At the November meeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, faculty unanimously voted for Faust and the Harvard Corporation, the University’s highest governing body, to reverse the policy. Faust ultimately kept the contested new policy but established the reimbursement program.
Under the controversial plan, 10,855 enrolled faculty and staff members will be affected. Employees may pay up to $1,500 a person and up to $4,500 for families of three or more out of pocket to cover copays, coinsurance, deductibles, and drug costs.
According to the fact sheet, Harvard estimates that it will save $6.4 million in Fiscal Year 2015 as a result of the policy changes, and affected non-union employees will take on $2.5 million collectively, adding up to total savings of $3.9 million. The document, which does not list an author, estimated that costs will rise an average of $230.31 per employee as a result of the new policy.
The percentage of employees enrolled in Harvard’s benefits program has reached an all-time high, increasing from 84.5 percent to 88.2 percent since 2007; similarly, the number of enrolled employees electing family coverage increased to a high of 51.7 percent, according to the fact sheet. This higher enrollment has resulted in an increase of “approximately $48 million in cost to Harvard” from FY 2007 to 2014, according to the document.
Since FY 2001, the share of medical benefit costs paid by employees has risen from 19.6 percent to 22.7 percent, while Harvard’s share has fallen from 80.4 percent to 77.3 percent, according to the fact sheet.
Since 2005, Harvard has re-bid its medical and pharmacy contracts multiple times in an effort to secure more competitive prices.

Students from over 40 schools across the country gathered at Maxwell Dworkin and Northwest Labs this past weekend to listen to female professionals and attend workshops by technology companies such as Google and Microsoft at the second annual WECode conference.
According to Emi F. Nietfeld '15, WECode external relations co-chair, roughly 500 students attended the event this year, more than double the number at last year’s gathering of 200.
Nietfeld said the main objective of the conference was to build community among women in technology. She recalled a male professor who spoke on a panel at WECode last year.
“He came to us afterwards and said he was really disoriented and it was a super eye-opening experience for him,” she said. “...to be the only guy in a sea of women, he said, this is how my female colleagues must have felt at technical conferences all along.”
In addition to workshops and panels, WECode featured keynote speeches by Dona Sarkar from Microsoft, Marie Louise Kirk of Goldman Sachs, and Parisa Tabriz of Google. The event also showed a video from Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl K. Sandberg ’91 addressing the attendees and a presentation of how to launch “Lean In” circles at college campuses. The event closed on Sunday with an interactive Puzzle Day.
“While a lot of women start out college as CS and engineering majors,” Dona Sarkar said, they do not continue with those fields through graduation. She emphasized the need to build mentorship networks in order to encourage more women to pursue science and technology.
Emily S. Wang ’18 said she appreciated the focus on building solidarity. “Because we’re all in the same boat and all face similar challenges, we can learn from each other, and I think that can be really helpful,” she said.
The conference underwent a handful of changes this year, such as replacing a hack-a-thon with a Puzzle Day.
Aida Zhumabekova, a junior at Mt. Holyoke College, said she appreciated the collaborative nature of the Puzzle Day over the hack-a-thon.
“It’s more about empowering. It’s not about competition anymore,” she said. “Maybe it’s even better because you don’t think of people you meet as rivals, you think of them as friends. This is an opportunity to learn.”

Undergraduate Council representatives urged one another to reach out to potential UC spring election candidates during their general meeting Sunday, addressing the low number of students who have already declared their candidacies.
According to Elections Commission Chair Matthew C. Estes ’18, only two students as of Sunday afternoon had declared their candidacy for the upcoming election to fill eight open seats. The period for candidate declarations—which was originally set to end at midnight on Monday—has been extended until Monday at noon.
UC President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 urged representatives to engage in personal outreach with potential candidates for the upcoming midterm elections.
Specifically, Student Relations Committee Chair William Oh ’18 said the Council aims to reach out to race, gender, and LGBTQ student groups in order to increase diversity of student voices on the UC.
“We really want the UC to be more inclusive and representative of Harvard itself,” Oh said. “We’re not looking for a quota; we’re looking for diverse voices.”
The Council also applauded the efforts of Freshman Class Committee chair Riya N. Patel ’17, who led a condom dispenser initiative, which installed dispensers in the basements of all freshman dorms this week. The project was funded in full by the Freshman Dean’s Office and Yard Operations.
Patel said the Freshman Class Committee is also seeking to update freshman dorm infrastructure this semester, including stocking kitchens, installing Keurig machines, and adding a game table in Canaday Hall.
At Sunday’s meeting, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said they will be meeting with Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and University President Drew G. Faust next week. Among the items on their agenda for discussion will be a gender empowerment campaign and a smartphone application package, two initiatives that the duo plan on prioritizing this semester. Representatives also suggested that Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal ask both administrators to clarify the protocol for determining when Harvard suspends operations due to snow.
Representatives also unanimously voted to approve two routine pieces of legislation on Sunday.
The Levenson-Marquand Act of 2015 authorizes the UC to hold its annual awards ceremony that rewards exemplary advising.
“Students will get to nominate [peer advising fellows], academic advisers, and professors who have had some special impact on their life,” Education Committee Chair Scott Ely ’18 said. “It’s a great way to show our appreciation for all the people who help us out here at Harvard.”
The Council also allocated close to $13,000 to 10 different student organizations in the first grants packages of the semester.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second consecutive game, the Harvard women’s basketball game came down to the last minute, and for the second time, the Crimson was on the losing end of a neck-and-neck battle with an Ivy League foe.
Friday night’s 83-80 loss came at the hands of Brown (8-11, 2-3 Ivy) under the helm of new Bears’ coach Sarah Behn.
After a back-and-forth battle that saw five ties and ten lead changes, Harvard (8-11, 1-4) lost their third consecutive Ancient Eight game, all three losses coming at home. Though Harvard was within two possessions nearly the whole game, Brown set the pace for much of the game as Harvard struggled to slow down the Bears’ top scorers.
Brown suffered early, as freshman starting forward Janie White fell to injury on the Crimson’s first possession following the tip-off. It appeared at first as though this may provide a window for Harvard to exploit the adjustments the Bears were forced to make down low, but the Brown guards filled in to prevent easy baskets in the paint.
“I’m sure they thought it [changed our game plan],” Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “It allowed them to just play scrappy guards that beat up on us and went after the ball real tough.”
Harvard’s frontcourt carried the bulk of the scoring with senior forwards Temi Fagbenle and Erin McDonnell and junior AnnMarie Healy each scoring in double digits. Fagbenle led all players on the court with 28 points. However very few of the baskets came easily as the Crimson scored 25 second-chance points compared to Brown’s four.
The Bears got off to a hot start in the first half as Harvard struggled to slow down their offense with a full court press. Brown had no trouble breaking through the pressure, leaving a fast break opportunity for an easy layup. The Bears went 11 for their first 15 attempts to take advantage of the Crimson’s struggles in transition defense. Harvard was able to eventually slow down Brown’s offense, but it may have been too little, too late.
“I just don’t believe you can start a ball game that way, and we’ve done that all year,” Delaney-Smith said. “Obviously I’m not coming up with a solution, but it’s very, very hard that we start games and dig ourselves a big hole that we’ve done game in and game out.”
Brown was led by the scoring of junior guard Ellise Sharp, who had 19 points on the night, and senior guard Sophie Bikofsky, who had 14 points, mainly on four-for-six three point shooting. Overall, the Bears went 10-for-19 behind the arc, while the Crimson struggled from deep, scoring on only seven of 21 attempts.
McDonnell started the second half strong, scoring Harvard’s first six points of the period. However, the Crimson could not gain an advantage, as Brown answered each of McDonnell’s baskets.
The game came down to the final minute, as with 12 seconds left senior guard Ali Curtis pulled the game within one with a deep three-pointer. However, Sharp sunk two free throws after a foul by Fagbenle to put the Bears back up by three. A desperation three-pointer by junior Shilpa Tummala missed the mark as the buzzer sounded.
“I think we fought hard the entire time, they just fought a little bit harder,” McDonnell said. “We had too many mental breakdowns…. We talked about wanting it more than them and that’s not just about hustle its about mental toughness, being smarter than them, outsmarting them on every single possessions and we had some unfortunate mental errors.”
With one more chance to win at home tomorrow night, the Crimson will face Yale tomorrow at 6 pm. Yale is currently undefeated in the Ivy League, coming off of a 60-46 win against Dartmouth, and will present a tough test for Harvard.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Saturday, with 6:30 left to play in a home matchup against Yale, Lavietes Pavilion did not seem like the scene of a miracle for the Harvard women’s basketball team (9-11, 2-4 Ivy).
The Bulldogs (11-9, 5-1) had trimmed a double-digit halftime deficit to two, culminating in a jump shot from junior guard Nyasha Sarju. Then, with the shot clock about to expire on the next Crimson possession, a Yale defender wrestled with senior forward Erin McDonnell for the ball and a chance to tie the game.
But in one motion, McDonnell jumped, wrested control, and threw up a prayer. The improbable shot banked in, eliciting the loudest roars of the night from the Harvard crowd.
“That was kind of a Hail Mary and luck,” McDonnell said. “[I] did not practice the bank.”
McDonnell’s trey jumpstarted a 10-0 run that flipped the momentum and ultimately gave the Crimson the game, 65-55.
“Before the game, [Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith] told all of us that every single one of us needs to step up,” freshman guard Kirby Porter said. "It was a huge team effort tonight.”
Even so, the Bulldogs introduced some drama in the final minutes. With 2:02 left, a Yale jumper made the game a two-possession contest.
But senior forward Temi Fagbenle staved off the comeback by scoring seven of the Crimson’s last eight points, which included a perfect performance from the charity stripe.
Throughout the contest, Harvard employed a pressure defense in the half-court that gambled on the Bulldogs' inability to make open threes. Especially in the first frame, the strategy flustered Yale, who committed 10 turnovers before intermission and did not make its first shot beyond the arc until after 19 minutes of play.
“It was the correct risk for us to take tonight, I feel,” Delaney-Smith said. “It was obvious to us that Yale was on its heels, so if [we] stay in the play, we won’t let them off the hook.”
Defensive intensity was a large reason for a 13-3 Crimson run at the end of the first period that opened up a double-digit lead. Porter began this stretch with three consecutive baskets en route to a career-high nine points and seven rebounds.
Midway through the second half, the Bulldogs clawed back thanks to a 7-0 streak. The stretch was part of a larger five-minute period in which Harvard failed to score a single basket.
McDonnell, who is shooting 43 percent from behind the arc this season, led the Crimson with 18 points, all of which came off three-pointers.
“I had my feet set a lot earlier than I usually do,” McDonnell. “That gave me better timing and a better rhythm. Once two go in, the rest go in.”
The senior also grabbed eight rebounds, second on the team to Fagbenle, who finished with 17 points and nine boards.
“Our offensive strategies were just to execute because we have an unreal offensive system and all the talent to score,” McDonnell said. “We just tried to use all the tools in our toolkit and run our offenses…. When we run them, people can’t stop us.”
Yale guards Tamara Simpson and Sarju provided much of the offense for the visitors. On the game, the backcourt mates combined for 27 points on 12-of-25 shooting.
A matchup marked by intensity began just that way, as the opening tip-off turned right into a possession tie-up. A few seconds later, McDonnell began the game’s scoring with her first three of the evening.
The victory over the Bulldogs broke a three-game losing streak for Harvard, which now sits sixth in the Ivy League. Yale entered the contest without a conference loss and in a tie atop the league with undefeated Princeton, who now has sole possession of first place.
“I think this is a big turning point for us,” McDonnell said. “We’ve had some unfortunate tough losses, so I think we really needed this as a team to remember how good we are [and] how good we can be.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This Friday, the Harvard men’s volleyball team was truly a team of brothers, as the sibling combination of D.J. and Casey White led the No. 15 Crimson (5-3, 1-0 EIVA) to a 3-1 victory over Sacred Heart (2-5, 0-1) in Fairfield, Conn. The victory, which marked Harvard’s first match of conference play, furthered a four-game winning streak.
However, the outlook was far less rosy when the Crimson convened as a team moments after dropping the first set. Helped by four service aces, including three by sophomore setter Christopher Delucie, the Pioneers had yet to trail after fighting to a 25-18 win in the first set.
“In the first game, we were pretty lackadaisical,” co-captain and outside hitter D.J. White said. “There was a lot of energy on the other side of the court, and we didn’t match it.”
But when play resumed, Harvard responded with an 8-2 start. Junior outside hitter Branden Clemens highlighted this streak by winning three straight points from the service line, one of which was an ace.
On the game, D.J. White topped the Crimson in kills with 16 and came in second with eight digs. Meanwhile, Casey did the opposite, recording a team-best 11 digs and a second-best nine kills.
“We kind of think the same way on the court,” the younger White said. “I can just give him a look, and he understands what I’m telling him.... It’s nice to have a high volleyball IQ player on the court who thinks the way I do.”
D.J. came into his own in the third set, racking up six kills in the period. His offensive outburst helped Harvard open up a 12-point advantage, the largest of the game, and force the decisive fourth set.
Aside from the first game, the Crimson’s offense reached impressive heights, posting hitting percentages above .400 in the final three frames. Harvard committed 12 errors overall, while Sacred Heart racked up 23.
“Their backs were against the wall,” Casey said. “They played hard. But when we’re playing well, it’s hard for them to stop us.”
After two lopsided games, the Pioneers played the Crimson to an even 9-9 in the fourth set. An hour after seizing control of the second set, the visitors turned to Clemens again, and the outside hitter served through a 4-0 streak that built a lead that Sacred Heart could not overcome.
In a pattern common to the last four games, Harvard relied on solid blocking. Against the Pioneers, the Crimson claimed 14 rejections, including five from co-captain Caleb Zimmick.
“Our offense was pretty amazing tonight…but I think our defense was a huge part of that too,” D.J. said. “It was one of the better games for the defense.”
On the other side of the court, senior outside hitter Enzo Mackenzie bested all players with 18 kills. Junior middle blocker Travis Vonholt contributed 11 finishes to the attack.
While Delucie only nabbed five kills, the setter had an outsized impact in the first set, when Sacred Heart first built an advantage as a result of two consecutive aces from Delucie. This advantage opened up midway through the game after a 7-2 stretch laced with Harvard errors.
“We went in kind of expected to win,” Casey said. “[They] came out and punched us in the face. We had to respond…. The rest of the match, we were clicking pretty well.”
The Crimson’s last loss came against No. 11 IFPW three weekends ago. Since then, Harvard has dropped only one set, namely the first one against the Pioneers.
The White brothers have played a consistent role in this success, as D.J. and Casey are first and second respectively in overall kills. Casey also boast a team-best 3 digs per set while D.J. tops the team in points.
“We’re a confident team, but I would not say we’re overconfident,” Casey said. “We know that everyone in this league can contend, and we treat every match like that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Another weekend for the Harvard track and field team, another opportunity to break records.
The Crimson has made a habit of setting new records throughout the season, and this weekend was no different, as the squad turned in record-setting performances at the Crimson Elite Meet, New Balance Indoor Grand Prix, and Scarlet and White Invitational.
“It was a good weekend for us overall,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said. “There’s also some things that we look to identify that we need to tighten up and work on as we prepare for the championship part of our season.”
SCARLET AND WHITE INVITATIONAL
Harvard wrapped up its weekend with a solid performance at Boston University, as various athletes set top-10 program finishes.
The performances were highlighted by the women’s 4 x 400 meter relay as the team clocked in at 3 minutes, 43.78 seconds – good for second in Harvard history.
In the 800 meter run, senior Gabrielle Scott finished with a time of 2:08.13 to place fourth in Harvard history while classmate Ashley Collinsworth set a personal best in the 200 meters with a time of 24.43.
Junior Allison Morrison finished second in the high jump with a mark of 1.65 m, while freshman Floriane Kameni’s 11.67 meter hop gave her a fourth-place finish.
On the men’s side, senior Nephat Maritim finished sixth in the 1,000 meter race with a time of 2:28.99. Classmate Connor Reck placed fifth in 800 meter run with a 1:51.64 finish.
NEW BALANCE INDOOR GRAND PRIX
The Crimson sent one team to Roxbury, Mass., to compete in the women’s 4,000 meter distance medley. The Grand Prix is an event primarily geared to international competition, with only one collegiate race.
The Harvard women would set a new school record with a time of 11:22.53 – good for the fastest collegiate finish in a field which set a new world record.
“It was an incredible experience, all of us were very excited to be there,” captain Erika Veidis said. “The energy in that meet was pretty outstanding.”
CRIMSON ELITE MEET
The weekend would get off to a quick start, as the Crimson would set two Ivy League records and three school records on the Gordon Indoor Track.
Danielle Barbian saw her Ancient Eight record in the 60-meter dash fall, as the senior clocked in at 7.41, .03 seconds faster than her previous mark en route to the title.
The senior was joined in the Ivy record books by sophomore Nikki Okwelogu, who continued her dominating season with a 16.39 meter throw, besting her previous record by .3 meters. Okwelogu would take home the title, finishing almost three meters ahead of the second place finisher.
The female athletes wouldn’t be the only ones to get involved however, as senior Jarvis Harris broke his school record in the 60-meter hurdles with a time of 7.96. The mark was good for a second-place finish in his first race of the season.
While the athletes’ performances were outstanding, Saretsky believes they have the potential to do even better.
“For all three of those athletes, the most exciting part, at least in my perspective, is how much room there is for those records to continue to drop,” Saretsky said. “I know that they’re focused and not satisfied with where they’re at.”
The day would not stop there for Harvard however, as the team continued to take home titles and personal bests.
In the field events, the Crimson would sweep the high jump, as sophomore Reagan Nizdil and junior Spencer Lemons would take the titles with jumps of 1.70 meters and 2.04 meters, respectively.
Sophomore Josh Whitener and senior Taylor DuPont both placed third in the weight throw, with throws of 18.60 meters and 16.86 meters in the male and female competitions, respectively.
The action wouldn’t stop there, as sophomore Andrew Roney and rookie Matthew Miller both reached a height of 4.50 meters to tie for third in the pole vault.
On the track, Autumne Franklin finished third in the 60-meter hurdles in her best performance of the season with a time of 8.54. Rookie Fiona Davis would clock in at 5:13.58 in the mile – good for a second place finish.
On the men’s side, freshman Tomoya Hasegawa and sophomore David Fan would place second and third in the 200 meter race, respectively, while rookie Malcolm Johnson would claim third in the 60-meter dash.
The performances by Harvard look good as the team prepares for H-Y-P, one of the biggest meets of the year for the Crimson.
“I think the team as a whole feels confident heading into the coming weekend,” Veidis said. “We’ve had some great performances so far and I think that everyone feels there is so much more there.”
Harvard returns to action next weekend as the team hosts Yale and Princeton at the annual H-Y-P meet at the Gordon Indoor Track.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just four ECAC games left in the season and a tight race for first in the league, the No. 4/4 Harvard women’s ice hockey team jumped to the top of the standings with two sweeping wins at home. The Crimson (18-4-2, 14-3-1 ECAC) netted 13 goals over the weekend and allowed just two, as Yale (10-13-1, 7-10-0) and Brown (5-20-0, 2-16-0) fell at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center on Friday and Saturday, respectively.
As the team heads towards its first Beanpot title game since 2011—a rematch with No. 1/1 Boston College on Tuesday night—and the end of the regular season, Harvard coach Katey Stone is keeping a level head.
“[We’re taking every game] one at a time,” Stone said. “Absolutely one at a time.”
HARVARD 7, BROWN 1
For the third game in a row, the home crowd on hand watched classic Crimson hockey, as fast skating and a multitude of aggressive line combinations kept the Bears from hitting any sort of offensive or defensive stride, leading to a huge margin of victory for Harvard.
Junior forward Mary Parker scored the first hat trick of her college career in the win. Two minutes into the contest, sophomore defenseman Natasha Rachlin fired an attempt at Brown goaltender Julianne Landry, which bounced off Landry’s pads and towards Parker, who snuck it into the net.
Her second and third goals came rapidly within 36 seconds of one another, as the Crimson accumulated offensive steam in the final minutes of the second period to score three times in just over a minute and a half.
“A big focus of ours over the last couple of weeks has been playing a full 60 minutes, so we’ve been really focusing to continue that and not [let] up as the game goes on,” Parker said.
The flurry of goals came after Harvard had to stave off two minutes of shorthanded five-on-four play and three minutes of five-on-three play.
“I was happy with how we killed it,” Stone said. “I like how our kids handled that…and then we turned around and made them pay."
First, freshman forward Haley Mullins was called for checking, a major penalty of five minutes. Nearly three minutes into the Bears’ extended power play, sophomore forward Sydney Daniels entered the box for tripping, and the Crimson had to contend with two fewer skaters on the ice. Brown fired off six attempts—nearly half of its game total for shots (14)—but was unable to score. In contrast, Harvard had 46 shots on goal over the three periods, its highest mark all season.
“I think our speed was tough for them to handle,” Parker said. “We’re a pretty fast team so we were taking it to them all over the ice."
HARVARD 6, YALE 1
To open the weekend, senior forward Lyndsey Fry netted a hat trick that comprised half of the Crimson’s scores as Harvard beat Yale, 6-1, on Friday night. Fry first struck with an unassisted goal in the final minutes of the opening frame.
In the second period, Fry drilled back to back goals, the first of which was assisted by Daniels and senior top-pair defenseman Sarah Edney. The second came while the Crimson was on the power play, assisted by seniors Marissa Gedman and Josephine Pucci. Fry’s third score marked the 50th of the Olympic silver medalist’s Harvard career.
Junior forward Miye D’Oench scored twice, while Edney added a goal of her own. The Crimson went 2-for-4 on power plays, also carrying an edge in shots on goal, 35-21.
In goal, Brianna Laing made her eighth start of the season and played all 60 minutes in goal for her seventh win this year.
On the other end of the ice, Bulldog goalie Jaimie Leonoff, who once made 131 saves over a weekend of tournament play against Harvard last season, went just 17-for-22 in her time between the posts over less than two periods of play.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second weekend in a row, the result was hanging in the balance when the Harvard women’s tennis team entered its final two matches of the day. On Sunday afternoon at the Murr Center, Amy He fell in three sets to North Texas sophomore Alexis Thoma, but freshman Annika Ringblom picked up a 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 victory to give Harvard its third straight win in a 4-3 thriller over the Mean Green.
He and Thoma finished right as Ringblom was wrapping up her second set tiebreaker, which sent the match to a decisive third set. In a day that would end up featuring three three-set singles matches, the No. 49 Crimson (4-1 overall, 0-0 Ivy) and No. 70 North Texas (2-6 overall, 0-0 Conference USA) looked evenly matched, alternating points and games the entire day.
With each member of both teams gathered around Court 3 at the Murr Center, Sunday’s match would come down to the Harvard first-year and Mean Green junior Anastasiya Shestakova.
“With Annika, what happened was not surprising because at practice, she’s super-positive, super-loud, super-spirited, and she’s a tough player, so the entire team had full confidence that she could pull it out,” captain Sylvia Li said. “To see her pull this out as a freshman—I’m just really happy she got to experience it.”
After losing the first set, Ringblom went into a second set tiebreaker after both players had won six games. The California native was able to break to take the tiebreaker, 7-5. The final set, which concluded almost five hours after the day’s action began, was the type of battle the two teams had been playing all day.
Shestakova took the first game while Ringblom took the next two. Shestakova won the fourth game and the two held serve for the next three. Ringblom was able to break to put her one game away from victory. The North Texas junior would not go away, breaking Ringblom to make it 5-4. However, the freshman took care of business when she needed to, winning the last game and the set, 6-4, to give the Crimson a 4-3 victory.
“I do well when a lot of people are cheering me on and yelling at me and I love fist pumping to the crowd and to the people so that was really exciting,” Ringblom said. “I definitely felt [the pressure] going into the last game at 5-4, but up until then, it was just really exciting to play.”
To put Ringblom in a position to clinch the victory, Harvard picked up victories from freshman Nikki Kallenberg, sophomore Monica Lin, and freshman Ellen Jang-Milsten.
The Crimson lost the doubles point after the Mean Green picked up two victories out of the three matches that were started.
“I thought overall we competed really well in singles today,” coach Traci Green said. “Our hats go off to North Texas—they came out on fire. We had a little bit of a slow start on the doubles, but our singles depth came through for us today. The match could have gone either way, and we’re very fortunate to get away with the win today.”
The team’s singles depth was key in Sunday’s victory, as injuries forced Green to tweak the Crimson’s usual line-up. Ringblom injured her foot at the end of the second set, but Harvard was able to weather the struggle.
“None of our matches have been really easy, but we’ve been making sure to do just enough to get the win,” Li said. “That gives us a lot of confidence going [forward]. Having had all these wins, we have the confidence [of] knowing that if it comes really close, we can pull it out.”
Ringblom seemed to always have an answer for the more experienced Shestakova. Her fist pump after the final point energized her teammates and the Crimson fans in attendance.
“Annika’s a very special player,” Green said. “She’s always positive and never gives up. That’s all you can ask for from a freshman and from a teammate. We’re very proud of her and what she did today.”

The streak continues for the Harvard skiing team, as the squad nabbed their fourth consecutive top-10 finish at the Dartmouth Carnival this past weekend. The team finished with 224 points, just 17 behind ninth place St. Michael’s.
The Crimson was once again led by the Nordic component of their roster, with senior Akeo Maifeld-Carucci pacing the team with an 18th place finish in the 10-kilometer freestyle. The Bozeman, MT, native finished the race with a time of 27:36.0.
Maifeld-Carucci was followed by sophomore Ian Meyer and freshman Connor Green, who crossed the line in 38th and 41st, respectively.
In the sprint portion of the competition, sophomore Devlin Shea led the team with a time of 3:14.9, placing him 19th in the field. Shea was finished just ahead of Maifeld-Carucci, whose 3:15.8 finish was good for 21st place.
The women were led by sophomore Rachel Hampton, whose strong season continued with a 24th place finish in the 10-kilometer freestyle race. The Telluride, CO, native finished the event with a time of 33:25.2.
Teammate Annie Harvieux followed the sophomore with a 33rd place finish, clocking in at 34:34.1. Junior Hanna Barnes would finish the race with a time of 34:42.1, good enough for a 35th place finish.
In the women’s classic sprint event, Harvieux would post a time of 3:22.0 to finish in 23rd place, just two seconds short of finishing inside the top 20. The junior was followed by sophomore Maile Sapp, who placed 31st with a time of 3:24.7.
The race would turn out to be the tightest of the day, as there was a spread of just over five seconds in between the 20th and 35th place finishers.
Barnes and freshman Emily Rogers would finish off the race for Harvard with finishes of 41st and 44th, clocking in with times of 3:31.2 and 3:33.4, respectively,
In the alpine portion of the carnival, the women would be the only competitors that Harvard would send to New Hampshire.
Freshman Kelly Stevens would lead the team with a 33rd place finish in the slalom and a 31st place finish in the giant slalom, with junior Samantha Udolf placing 44th in the slalom.
The team returns to action next weekend as they travel to compete at the Middlebury Carnival.

No. 3 Harvard women’s squash (10-1, 6-1 Ivy) finished off the regular season with a winning streak, topping No. 5 Yale (10-4, 4-3) on Friday at the Murr Center and No. 11 Brown (5-8, 0-7) on Sunday at the Kate Brodsky Squash Pavilion.
Coming off of a win against No. 1 Trinity, the Crimson was looking to finish off its regular season with a pair of wins and enter the tournament season on the right footing.
“After our big win against Trinity on Wednesday, we were feeling great,” co-captain Megan Murray said. “We weren’t expecting to beat them as decisively, so we went into Friday definitely with the mindset of having the same sight as Wednesday and trying to come up with just as a decisive a win.”
HARVARD 9, BROWN 0
Harvard extended the Bears’ losing streak with another win on Sunday in the final match of the regular season.
“The team really came together,” freshman Alyssa Mehta said. “I think we’ve all really improved fitness wise and mentally.”
Five members of the Crimson squad finished the season with a perfect record: senior Amanda Sobhy, juniors Isabelle Dowling and Saumya Karki, sophomore Dileas MacGowan, and freshman Sue Ann Yong.
Dowling had the longest game of the five and of the day, playing five matches against Alexandra White out of the No. 9 spot. Dowling took the win in the first and third matches, but White fought back relentlessly, always tying up the game to force it to five matches. In a match that came down to the final few points, Dowling pulled out the win.
Murray finished her last regular season in her fourth appearance for the Crimson at the No. 8 spot. Murray defeated Isabel Pitaro in three straight matches, winning each one by at least eight points.
Yong, at the No. 4 spot, also won 3-0, but her matches against Mina Shakarshy were closer. With 10 match victories under her belt, the Harvard freshman has the most wins on the team.
This was the Crimson’s seventh 9-0 sweep of the season, the same number as the 2013-2014 season.
“It was the last road trip for the seniors, so that was also a nice little end to the season,” Murray said.
HARVARD 9, YALE 0
“We definitely wanted to prepare the same way that we prepared for our match on Wednesday and all our other matches this season,” Mehta said. “So we were expecting it to be tough and we were expecting that everyone would have to play really well.”
Harvard dominated against Yale on Friday, clocking in five 3-0 sweeps that day. Sobhy led the team with her sound defeat of Jenny Scherl at the No. 1 position. Senior Julianne Chu also contributed a 3-0 win over Jocelyn Lehman at the No. 8 position. With this win, Chu maintained her perfect record for the season.
Juniors Michelle Gemmell and Karki as well as sophomore Katherine Tutrone also did not drop any matches to the Bulldogs.
“Overall I think our team has been really strong this past week,” Murray said. “Individually, everyone has been really focused and really on her personal game plan and making adjustments each game from match to match and really bringing everything they have each day.”
Harvard lost only four matches on the day, with players dropping matches at the No. 3, No. 5, No. 7 and No. 9 positions. Yong came away with her ninth straight victory to open her Crimson career.
“What we’re taking from other games is really just hustling for every point, staying strong mentally, being competitive,” Mehta said. “We’re hoping to take that fight and determination into Nationals with us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a shaky start to the Princeton Invitational, the No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team rallied on Sunday to finish its four-game slate with an even split.
The Crimson (4-3, 2-1 CWPA) rode two double-digit goal outputs to two victories on Sunday after averaging less than eight per game on Saturday, bringing its record back above .500 on the year.
HARVARD 12, IONA 8
The Crimson avenged a loss earlier in the season to Iona (3-3) with a three-goal win over the Gaels. After scoring only two goals in the first quarter, Harvard exploded for five in the second to stretch its lead to three.
Even after a late surge from Iona, the Crimson prevailed by the same margin in the end, thanks in large part to junior Charlotte Hendrix’s five goals in the contest. Senior Kalina Grabb also was a potent force, notching four goals.  Those two goal totals combined were more than Harvard scored in its 10-8 to Iona earlier this year.
HARVARD 12, VILLANOVA 3
The first game Sunday was highlighted by stout defense from the Crimson, as the team allowed only three goals to the Wildcats (0-6) throughout the entire matchup. Harvard, on the other hand, averaged three per quarter, with juniors Yoshi Andersen and Hendrix notching three goals apiece as well.
The Crimson opened the contest with eight of the game's first nine goals and never looked back. Senior Victoria Frager was crucial to the flow of the Harvard attack, picking up four assists in the victory. With the win, the Crimson has now beaten the Wildcats twice on the season with by a margin of twenty goals.
PRINCETON 12, HARVARD 6
The story was not the same on the first day of the tournament. Despite a pair of goals from Andersen and sophomore Melissa Balding, Harvard was also unable to beat the host of the invitational, folding to the No. 9 Tigers (2-0) by a six-goal margin.
Princeton, who wound up finishing the weekend with wins in three of its four contests, broke the game open in the second half. After holding a slim 5-3 halftime lead, the Tigers scored seven of the game's final ten goals to lock up the win. Senior Ashley Hatcher and rookie Chelsea Johnson paced Princeton with three goals each.
WAGNER 12, HARVARD 9
In its opening match of the Invitational on Saturday, the Crimson allowed five second quarter goals to Wagner (2-1), allowing the Seahawks to seize control of the match early on. Riding a four-goal halftime lead, Wagner came away with a 12-9 victory.
Harvard emerged from the first quarter tied with the Seahawks, but Wagner junior Lily Doerfler's three second-quarter goals propelled her side ahead. The Crimson would eventually cut its deficit to 10-8, but that was as close as Harvard would get.
This marks the second straight weekend that the Crimson has played at least three games on the road. Last weekend, the Crimson opened the year with two wins over St. Francis and Villanova and a loss to Iona. In its two wins, Harvard combined for a total of 34 goals while allowing only 14. The Crimson's 15-6 victory over St. Francis provided the team with momentum this weekend, as Harvard responded to three Terrier goals with ten unanswered prior to halftime.

Finally, after months of jealously receiving Snapchats from friends at other Boston schools, having to commute to get to Harvard parties is the only thing BC and BU people can now brag about when talking to ya Harvard girl, Betty "Noshoes" Richardson.

I've always received Snapchats from my friends at BC and BU with their own Snapchat geofilters, and wondered why we never had one ourselves (literally, the tourists who pose with their selfie sticks all over the Yard would go insane over that). But it's all good because yesterday, when I posed for a Snap-selfie and slid right to include a timestamp, A HARVARD FILTER SHOWED UP!!! This was literally the most excited I had been to Snapchat on campus since we had our own snapfeed at Harvard Yale, though I’m still bitter that this legend of a pre-HY tailgate snap on your left did not make the cut.
Honestly, though. It’s about time, Harvard. I have snapped far too long photos of me on campus, worrying that my snapfriends won’t know that I go to Harvard. I can take a selfie with John Harvard, or Amy Poehler, or Chris Pratt, but am I really at Harvard if I don’t have a geofilter that gleams my school’s name in a beautiful cursive font?
This is just the beginning of a revolution as I see it. Though I will never get over not being able to see people’s best friends on Snapchat (aka I’m not up-to-date about who’s hooking up with whom), this geofilter game on Snapchat could get really real. Even though I can’t currently find the beautiful Harvard geofilter that I so admired last night, maybe that cursive Harvard will make a comeback, or better yet, maybe an even better cursive Harvard will compete. And, not to make any promises, but I have heard whispers of different clubs on campuses making their own geofilters. Regardless, a girl can always dream. Until then, I will keep swiping right on my snaps until I regain a geofilter, just as I would swipe right a million times if I saw myself on Tinder.
