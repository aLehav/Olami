“Grey’s Anatomy” returned to screens Thursday, Sept. 30 for yet another season premiere. After a grueling depiction of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on hospital staff in Season 17, Season 18 returns with a relatively anti-climactic look at the future of Grey Sloan’s doctors a year later.
The episode opens with a disclaimer about the show’s post-pandemic setting and reminds the audience to learn more about vaccination. However, following this disclaimer, the episode then catapults into an alternative world free of the COVID-19 virus — which is a welcome change. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) wakes up from a dream where she faces a surgical board filled with routine surgeries and the disapproval of her dead mother, an overused theme throughout the show. She struggles to live up to the expectation of miraculously surviving COVID, not unlike her previous anxieties about living up to her mother’s surgical legacy. The plot thickens, however, when her trip to Minnesota to discuss a research library dedicated to her mother turns into a job offer that could make her the face of the cure for Parkinson’s.
Meredith’s sister, Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), is in another relationship where she and her partner have differing views. In prior seasons, her boyfriend Owen Hunt, (Kevin Mckidd) wanted kids and she didn’t; now, new love interest Link (Chris Carmac) wants to get married and Amelia doesn’t. What differs this time, however, is her attitude: She’s now giving herself the freedom to let the relationship fail. A wide range of post-pandemic relationships are depicted in this episode, from Amelia and Link’s rocky situation to Maggie (Kelly McCreary) and Winston’s (Anthony Hill) newlywed flirtations and Owen and Teddy (Kim Raver)’s wedding. The wedding is a drawn out resolution of years of back-and-forth between the two trauma surgeons, and the dramatic bicycle crash during the ceremony simply creates confusion and sets up the potential bad omen of a priest dying on their O.R. table. The riders argue about the crash and merely provide rhetoric on the “quiet hatred” that can develop within a marriage, in clear support of Amelia’s perspective on the issue but in contrast to the two newlywed couples present by the end of the episode.
Other glimpses into post-pandemic life include its effect on the mental health of children, a topic examined through Dr. Cormac Hayes (Richard Flood)'s son Austin (Jayden Haynes-Starr), who is experiencing panic attacks. The show touches on many challenges children faces during the pandemic, including the breakdown of their established social circles and the atrophy of valuable social skills typically practiced while working on homework, grabbing lunch, or participating in clubs with others. Though most teens likely wouldn’t approve of the show’s proposed solution of having a parent invite another parent and their children over for dinner, its discussion of the pandemic’s effects on youth and mental health as a whole is important in making sure people see their struggles represented in media and feel comfortable working to overcome them.
Another storyline this episode revolved around the senior staff’s interviews with candidates for several vacant positions, including the job of Head of Plastics and of General Surgeon. Dr. Michelle Lin (Lynn Chen), a candidate of interest for the plastics job, straightforwardly describes Grey Sloan’s physician shortage when confronted about her lack of experience. She mentions the physician shortage affecting not only Grey Sloan, but hospitals across the nation due to deaths and resignations of hospital staff. Hospitals have moved out of the public sphere of interest as the pandemic progressed, yet they are dealing with issues just as important as the ones they were facing last March. The moral toll of working through the most dangerous stage of the pandemic and losing patients without the ability to save them or let them say goodbye to their families has been experienced by healthcare workers across the nation.The skillful acknowledgment here of that challenge draws some much-needed attention to the resources accessible to healthcare workers who are still dealing with the impact of these challenges.
This is not Grey’s Anatomy’s finest season premiere, but it is an important one when considering the broader context of discussing what a post-pandemic world might look like. It acknowledges important challenges that various people in healthcare and their loved ones are facing, but provides little in the character development of its stars, instead rehashing overused conflicts. The remainder of Season 18 has some potential to develop its storylines and deepen its characters, but might unfortunately focus more on resolving the issues presented in this episode than wrapping up the show’s broader story arcs.

A new student group out of the Harvard Film Archive, or HFA, has recently begun organizing free weekly film screenings for Harvard students.
While the HFA has been a fixture at Harvard College since 1979, never before has the Archive seen this level of student engagement in its programming. The screenings are organized by a group of students including Tiff A. Rekem ’22 and Ton-Nu Nguyen-Dinh ’22, alongside HFA Director Haden Guest.
Rekem and Nguyen-Dinh said after a particularly engrossing film class taught by Guest, they wanted to work to make cinema accessible for the college’s student body.
“The HFA is its own organization,” said Rekem. “Up until this point, it’s done screenings for the community, screenings for students, but now there is an unprecedented rush of student interest in collaborating with the space.” Rekem and Nguyen-Dinh meet weekly with other students to discuss which films to screen next. The democratic decision is informed by a film’s relationship to current events, relevance to the Harvard community, and significance to students within the group.
The ideas that infuse each week’s decision are often illuminated during a community member’s introduction of the film before the screening officially begins. “We were foregrounding the issue of racism on this campus and how that has been exacerbated by COVID,” Nguyen-Dinh said about introducing Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing” (1989).
For this new group, inclusion is key. As community organizers, Rekem said that she and Nguyen-Dinh ask themselves every day how they can best make their programming accessible and gear it towards dismantling white supremacy.
Questions such as these arose for the Harvard Film Archive two summers ago, after the national outcry for racial equity following the murder of George Floyd. Professor Haden Guest, director of the Harvard Film Archive and a senior lecturer in the Department of Art, Film, and Visual Studies, said the student group makes sure all voices are heard in part through its non-hierarchical structure.
“It’s designed to give students a space to really discuss and debate and learn more about their own passions,” Guest said. Guest empowers students to make their own choices regarding the content of the screenings, only stepping in as faculty advisor to help out with the more practical aspects of getting a film from the Archive to the big screen.
At a recent event, the HFA screened Andrei Tarkovsky’s 1975 film, “Mirror,” for a large crowd of students. Despite its abstract nature, audience members were captivated by “Mirror” throughout its near-two hour runtime. “It’s great to watch these movies that you can’t see anywhere else with a little community,” said Aidin R. Kamali ’25, who was particularly excited by the HFA’s use of actual film in their screenings. When asked what he thought of “Mirror” itself, Kamali said he might need a few months to digest it, a sentiment anticipated by Rekem and Nguyen-Dinh.
The Harvard Film Archive’s student group hopes to spark new conversations through the thought-provoking films they screen each week. The team is encouraged by the size of the group of students returning again and again each week to think deeply about a new movie — be it older or more recent. Most of all, however, the HFA student group wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is no wrong way to watch a film. “It’s okay to fall asleep and be confused,” said Nguyen-Dinh.
As every screening is free to Harvard students, the theater — found in the basement of the Carpenter Center — is typically packed with cinephiles and casual moviegoers alike. Tickets are available to interested parties each week on the HFA’s website.

A synth bass loop and two sets of toxic exes star in “One Right Now,” a single from Canadian pop star The Weeknd and alt-rock rapper Post Malone released on Nov. 5. Without straying from their respective niches in the music scene, “One Right Now” features The Weeknd and Post Malone as lovesick heartthrobs on their first collaboration. Likewise, the song itself stays true to the typical cliches of love, heartbreak, and revenge that characterize much of their music.
Angst, adultery, and apathy (oh my!) dominate the chorus. The toxic cycle of call and response threats like “You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings” are answered with “I got one comin' over and one right now,” showcasing an endless cycle of unsatisfying revenge. Post Malone runs the theme of red flags into the ground in his verse, detailing how a game of “body for a body” isn’t satisfying his anger but driving it.
The lyrics only get more bleak from there with a series of borderline sexist, downright nasty insults directed at the singers’ exes. “Bought you a new face, you should call me ‘Dad,’ baby” is a trashy thing to say to anyone, let alone a previous love interest. Meanwhile, the paranoid speculations in lines like “you probably fuck all my enemies” seem like more of a reflection on the singers’ insecurity than the subject’s choices. The narrative on this track is already worn out by the same old “hell hath no fury” story, and the fact that certain lines lack finesse doesn’t help at all.
How “over it” can someone truly be if they dedicate a whole song to someone who they swear wasn’t good enough to be in their life in the first place? The theme of outgrowing a past love might seem commendable, but it's lacking any growth when the only personal satisfaction the protagonists achieve is realizing that “maybe one's just not еnough” to get back at their exes. The unwarranted speculations are a bad look and make for a boring listen.
The electropop production on this record is perhaps its only redeeming quality. The song’s introduction consists of The Weeknd’s signature tremolo vocalizations accompanied by the recursive synth bass line. There is something distinctly satisfying about the crisp cut layering of the fully-digital backing tracks set underneath such fluid and dreamy harmonies. The compressed beats cut back on the noise, leaving a wide space for the low-frequency synthesizer style of the higher synth pads. In this way, the song has a general Synthwave feel without the business of the retro sounds of the ‘80s. Additionally, there is perfect harmony in the chorus’ bass notes that escalate in an ascending arpeggio, showcasing the unity of the instrumentals and vocals. Clearly, Louis Bell, the vocal producer and engineer on this track, understood the assignment that the songwriters missed out on.
The vocal prowess on this potential-right first collaboration between two household names was wasted narrating rumors and detailing other people’s flaws. The fact that the brilliant production is the only commendable feature goes to show that this single was aiming for nothing substantively more than mainstream-ready and catchy pop songwriting.

TWICE’s most recent single “The Feels” is not only a relatable pop song for teens experiencing first love worldwide, but also very much in line with the vivacious, confident brand that the artists have spent years building up. Since debuting in 2015, the K-pop girl group has built an industry monopoly on bright, bubbly, and cheerful music. “The Feels” is also the group’s first official attempt to extend their brand overseas with an all-English single.
From the moment Chaeyoung begins singing an echoed version of the post-chorus, listeners can instantly interpret the direction of “The Feels” — a song about the all-too-familiar feeling of falling in love. The single continues to explore the jitters and nervousness of that feeling through the use of very cliché phrases, such as “catching feels like butterflies,” “I know love / It is such a funny thing,” and “I can feel a real connection / A supernatural attraction.”
Despite the rudimentary lyrics, the design of the music itself better represents TWICE’s consistently high-quality work. “The Feels” has a consistent bass beat that ebbs and flows throughout the entirety of the song in order to mirror the fluttering feelings of love. For instance, when the pre-chorus begins, the song transitions into a slower, more fluid style, perhaps to emphasize that one specific moment when an individual is certain they like someone. After this unique segment, the song jumps into the catchy, joyous chorus led by TWICE’s leader Jihyo and lead vocalist Nayeon.
A significant portion of the allure of “The Feels” comes from the single’s relatability. The questions featured in the lyrics — like “Are we on the same vibe?” or “If your heart beats the same way / Let me know" — are ones that almost all of us have asked when first falling for someone.
In totality, “The Feels” does an excellent job of encompassing the all-consuming nature of love through its obsessive yet clichéd lyrics and the captivating nature of its disco style. Album after album and single after single, TWICE continues to display their dependable character as a top K-pop group.

On Nov. 12, the Harvard Pops Orchestra presented “Pops Casts a Spell,” a theatrical rendition of an original magic-infused plot in collaboration with The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers (THUD) in the Lowell Lecture Hall. Contributing to the theme, the venue was suffused with mystical purple light and some of the musicians could be spotted with twists on a traditional orchestral attire: a witch’s hat, a Gryffindor-stamped robe, and a pink feather boa, to name a few.
Harvard Pops Orchestra is a student ensemble that showcases musical concerts fused with theatrical elements, featuring orchestral playing, acting, and singing.
“I like to think of what we do broadly, presenting theatrical evenings of entertainment. We play music at a very high level, but we also integrate a fun, comic story throughout,” said Allen G. Feinstein ‘86, the music director of Pops. “One of the reasons why I enjoy working with this group is because we have that extra creative side.”
The repertoire of the concert was as much of a fusion as the presentation style, juggling between funk rock, Disney soundtracks, theater, and jazz. “We center every show around a theme, and this year’s theme is magic, so we’re playing pieces like Howl’s Moving Castle, Danse Macabre, songs from Harry Potter, and Superstition,” said Georgiy A. Kent ‘22, one of the co-presidents of Harvard Pops. Some of their past themes have included time travel, funk, and British murder mystery — around which the ensemble crafted their repertoire and even a silent film to go along with the show. “Every show — and this is why we call it a show instead of a concert — is accompanied by a plot, fully written by members of the orchestra and acted by guest actors," said Kent.
“Pops Casts a Spell” centers around its own storyline: Lily and Larry are two recently graduated wizards from Hogvard (a portmanteau of Hogwarts and Harvard), who embark on a magical mission in an effort to thwart a dark wizard’s evil schemes. Along the way, the wizards face a “Wicked” pandemic, navigate “A Whole New World” to find “Howl’s Moving Castle,” and get in “Double Trouble,” amid other episodes that are each represented by a piece of music.
The first act starts with the wicked wizard Bartholomew’s monologue, played by Jacob K. Ostfeld ‘23, accompanied by comical snippets from the magical violin, performed by Skye G. Park ‘24. At the outset of the main characters’ journey, a magic pandemic gets in their way, which the orchestra captures in a classical memento mori, “Danse Macabre” by Camille Saint-Saëns. Bone-cracking noises of the col legno and blood-red stage light contrast with the comedy introduced by the two student wizards, Lily and Larry, played by Chloe A. Saracco '22 and Benjamin A. K. Topa '22. Their conversation includes clever Harvard-related spin-offs, from redefining LS1A as Lizard Summoning and CS50 as Computational Spells.
After several adventurous turns, the wizards reach “Howl’s Moving Castle,” and the orchestra begins to play a Symphonic Variation of "Merry-Go-Round" by Joe Hisaishi.
The soloist Rachel Guo ‘22, who is a past president of Harvard Pops, was excited to be performing back in-person. “There’s just something magical — like the theme of our concert — about playing together and everyone feeling this energy in the room. I can’t express it in words, but it’s an unforgettable feeling that I’ll carry with me even after I graduate.”
Act One closes with another piece featuring a virtuosic solo: "Fiddler On The Roof" arranged by John Williams, featuring Skye G. Park '24 on the violin. “It’s not a routine medley; when people think of a medley for a music from a broadway show, they just think it’s a series of tunes,” said Feinstein. “But this medley is very different because it is a part medley and then part kind of a violin concerto.”
Act Two spotlights a guest performance by THUD (The Harvard Undergraduate Drummers), which exists as an army of The Horrendously Underrated Demons in the realm of Pops. Making use of buckets and the metal chair legs, the ensemble portrays a brooding cohort of demons that the evil wizard summons. The concert concludes with a jazzified version of Beethoven’s Fifth by Walter Murphy, playfully repeating the iconic motif as the two student wizards triumph over the dark wizard.
Though “Pops Casts a Spell” is the group’s first live performance in almost two years, Harvard Pops stayed busy over the pandemic. “With people who were interested, we met weekly and worked on creative virtual projects. We did quite a number of them, actually,” said Feinstein. From creating an original podcast melodrama to filming a funky take on classical music, Harvard Pops stayed active by creating a series of “pandemic projects” over the past year.
Still, in-person concerts are irreplaceable, especially for an ensemble like Pops that often interacts with the audience. According to the director, Harvard Pops focuses on creating a friendly and immersive experience for the audience, and last Friday’s venue was a perfect place to do so. “We perform in Lowell Lecture Hall, which is very intimate — we’re never more than a few feet away from the audience,” said Feinstein. "It’s almost like a cabaret as opposed to a big concert hall. The informality of it is something we take advantage of.”
“Pops really acts as a break in your really busy schedule to just come and play fun music,” said Kent, reflecting on his last four years as a member of Pops. “Everything comes together, and you’re sitting there and thinking all of the work that you’ve put in this semester has come to this one moment. And you’re like, ‘Oh, right, this is why I’m doing this.’”

Not only did Taylor Swift release a 30-track album this past week, but she also premiered “All Too Well: The Short Film,” her writing and directorial debut. The response to the song’s 10-minute version has been momentous enough — the heart wrenching breakup song shot to the top of the Spotify charts upon its release — but the accompanying short film is equally impressive. The film satisfyingly aligns with the song’s lyrics without feeling like a traditional music video, all while carrying a storyline that explores the unbalanced power dynamics of a doomed relationship.
The film stars Sadie Sink and Dylan O’Brien as a couple with a significant age difference, the characters credited only as Him and Her. The film begins with Her asking Him, “Are you real?” — a question that follows viewers throughout, effectively framing the story without revealing its theme in an overtly obvious way. In this moment, the question is a genuine expression of amazement at Her lover, as they then begin to wander in the picturesque nature of early fall. Shots linger with abnormal length — an element director of photography Rina Wang effectively develops throughout the film. The camera twists, circles, and sways rather than cuts; this style of shooting introduces the viewer as an invisible third party peering into the journey of two lovers. Swift and Wang further amplify the intimacy between them with consistently vulnerable closeups.
Yet, in these scenes of fairytale romance, the first subtle glimpse of His paternal positioning is clear: He’s seen giving Her a piggy-back ride. Without context, the action could be perceived as innocent — hidden in the magical nature of the scenes, it’s easy to miss — but considering that He is several years Her senior, the moment is significant. Swift sneakily develops this storyline of how He manipulates Her by portraying His paternalistic, condescending attitude.
Soon enough, these warmly-lit, glorified scenes are abruptly contrasted by the turquoise coolness of a tense dinner party. The couple is joined by several of His friends, all of whom are older than Her; he callously drops Her hand at the table and leaves Her out of the conversation. The shots are no longer invasively close, but the lovers are now distanced both from the camera and each other. Without any dialogue, the mood shift is relayed clearly and quickly through lighting, physical spacing, and camera placement. Introduced in this scene, the tension between warm and cool color palettes emphasizes the growing distance between the couple.
From the dinner party Swift jumps forward — or possibly backward — to a moment in the woods when He tosses the car keys at Her to take a phone call in rage. The scene can feel disconnected at first, but Swift does not underestimate her viewers. At face value, the scene continues to develop the growing tension in the relationship, with His ego taking the form of condescension. However, viewers might soon realize that the scene mirrors the one that follows directly after — the raw, pivotal fight.
Both the car scene and the fight are dominated by His immature outbursts and disregard for Her feelings, and sickeningly conclude with him embracing her to diminish His wrong and manipulate Her perception of the situation. In this emotionally wrought fight scene, all elements of the film coincide in a climactic moment — the coldly lit kitchen, the distance between the lovers in shots, the camera moving back and forth between them in suspense. The longest single take of the film, combined with eerily realistic dialogue, makes for a deeply emotive scene. His manipulative hug to conclude the fight cleverly transitions into the pair embracing in warm lighting, with the question posed once again, “Are you real?” She now questions how “real” His affection is — if it was simply a ploy to gain Her forgiveness, was any of His love real?
This question is answered in “The Breaking Point,” where His power — hovering over Her as He ends the relationship — shifts to Her, as she stands up and scolds Him as if He were Her child. In the aftermath, Swift expands the tension inherent in their age gap by offering visual cues to Her youth while she deals with “adult” emotions of deeply painful heartbreak. Her patterned sheets, twin-sized bed, innocent, almost childish 21st birthday party, and Her presence at a cocktail party with older adults remind viewers that the lovers are about a decade apart in age. Sink is 11 years younger than O’Brien, surely an intentional casting choice made by Swift. As a director, she leans on her primary strength — subtle hints — to draw the viewers’ focus to the root of the relationship’s downfall. She was still on the cusp of childhood, and He abused that.
When She is no longer played by Sadie Sink, but by Taylor Swift herself, She looks older in comparison to Him. The actor switch shows that She has matured physically with time, and emotionally too — having produced a successful creative work as the result of her pain. Meanwhile, He still wears the red scarf that she left in the first scene. The power has shifted. As snow falls, Swift reminds viewers of nature’s cycle — the naive, young autumn must pass, and in its place, the wise and hardened winter will remain.

“Sugar Work,” author Katie Marya’s first full-length poetry collection, offers a vivid exploration of topics such as sex, motherhood, religion, and divorce. Marya’s poetry is deeply personal, particularly in its depiction of the author’s relationship with her mother, who worked at a strip club in Atlanta. It would be easy for a collection that covers such a wide variety of subject matter to feel like it’s trying to do too much. However, the poems within “Sugar Work” feel neither too broad nor too narrow in the scope of the full collection. Instead, the poems are united as an unflinching look at the many facets that make up a single life.
One of Marya’s greatest strengths is her use of figurative language, when poems pull together seemingly disparate images to create a full picture of motherhood. In “Meditations on Mother as House” and “An Open Call to Single Daughters of Single Mothers,” Marya uses vivid imagery to muse on her position in relation to her mother, as both her child and a woman herself. In the world of “Sugar Work,” there is nothing to which a mother cannot be compared. Her body is a house, a sequined costume, a memory from her daughter’s childhood.
In “The Religion I’ve Made of My Mother,” Marya further emphasizes her childhood admiration of her mother, which she describes as something approaching religious worship. She writes, “I believe in her hands. I can’t imagine a world without her / in it, eating and smoking . . . I can’t believe in a god who relies on wounds to be seen.”
Another poem that powerfully portrays the relationship between mother and daughter is “Excerpt from the Gold Club Trial,” a pair of poems split into two sides: “Mother” and “Daughter.” The “Mother” side is a transcription of an interview that Marya’s mother gave about an encounter with a group of NBA players at the strip club where she worked. The “Daughter” side describes the same scene, but from Marya’s own perspective as she watches her mother. The poems complement each other with a beautiful symmetry.
A standout poem in the collection is “The Quiet Divorce,” which depicts the understated turmoils of divorce through an analogy of a human-sized rabbit who takes up temporary residence in her home. Marya depicts the absence of a lover with outstanding subtlety. Another standout, “Self Portrait as Lined Sea Horse, as Coronet, as the Sun,” opens the fifth and final section of the collection. The poem contains perhaps the most masterful of Marya’s similes. She unites religious imagery with her own conception and birth, writing, “I make myself / from within her / like God cantilevered the whole / earth on gravity.”
There are, however, a few moments in the collection where it loses its vitality and is ultimately less impactful. For instance, in certain moments Marya loses her knack for subtlety. The poem “My First Period” is a bit too on-the-nose in its treatment of menstruation, teenage sexuality, and religion: “I asked / the boy to pray for me so he would have to touch me / and when he put his hands on my shoulders, I bled.” The poem “A Response to the 2018 IPCC Report,” which depicts themes of birth and future against the backdrop of climate change, suffers similarly. “For the Lover and Not for Who the Lover Loves'' also struggles to convey its message. The poem tries to speak on performative femininity, but its meaning is obscured by overly repetitive language.
Ultimately, “Sugar Work” is a celebration — an exaltation of sexuality, motherhood, and the sweetness of a human life lived to its fullest. The collection ends with “Prayer for the Lover,” an exceptional poem that radiates intense, almost violent joy that perfectly encapsulates the collection as a whole. “Let me crochet the sky into our skin,” Marya writes, “and confess grief to the sun.”

Who is Harvard Law School’s most famous graduate? If you didn’t say Elle Woods, you’ve got some serious rethinking to do. Between Oct. 28 and 31, the Asian Student Arts Project brought writers Laurence O’Keefe and Nell Benjamin’s musical “Legally Blonde” to Agassiz Theater. If musical productions could get scores on the LSAT, this one would surely get a 175.
As the title suggests, “Legally Blonde” is based on both the novel and film of the same name. For those not well-versed in the classics, the protagonist, Elle Woods (Natalie Choo ’22), is a stereotypical sorority girl: She’s obsessed with shopping, majors in Fashion Merchandising, and wears lots and lots of pink. When her boyfriend Warner Huntington III (Avery Hansberger ’25) dumps her for a more “serious” girl, Elle decides to follow him to Harvard Law School. There, Woods discovers she actually has a passion for law. With this new motivation, Elle finds herself arguing a murder case in just her first year of law school.
Karina Cowperthwaite ’23 wrote in her director’s note that one of her goals for this production was to push back on the assumption that Elle’s story is inherently a white one. Yet Cowperthwaite and Sam Dvorak ’23 — props designer and Crimson Arts Editor — did not simply insert an all-Asian cast into the original script: Instead of Richard Simmons, Elle’s next-door neighbor is Mandy Kaling; the signs in Paulette Bonafonté’s (Julia Riew ’22) salon are in Chinese; and apparently, Bruiser, Elle’s dog, loves “Squid Game.” Moreover, Elle’s internal Greek Chorus, played by Odessa Deng ‘23, Caron Sujean Kim ‘24, Sarah Latke, gets a Hercules-level revamping. This trio’s costumes and choreography give them the appearance of a K-pop group much more than a Greek Chorus. From Hello Kitty to a stuffed Gudetama, Cowperthwaite didn’t just recast the original; she transformed it into a celebration of Asian excellence in even the little details.
In addition to creating space for representation, “Legally Blonde” also put together an amazing design team. The lighting in particular, created by Isa Berliner ’23, thoughtfully complemented each scenes’ messaging. When Elle Woods arrived at Harvard Law, the stage was bathed in an all-too-familiar Harvard crimson. When her ruthless Professor Callahan (Elio Kennedy-Yoon ‘25) sang about a lawyer’s need to be cutthroat in order to succeed, a more blood-like red hue took over the stage. Like a drop of the “Blood in the Water” he sings about, the sanguine color seeped into the background. This possible commentary on the poison-like nature of heartless lawyers was then contrasted with the teal light that washed over the stage when Elle’s interest in law was first sparked — as she used her legal knowledge to help her friend Paulette. Choices like this effectively highlighted some of the more subtle themes of the musical.
The Asian Student Arts Project, as Cowperthwaite writes in her director’s note, is wrestling with the hard questions: “What does representation for Asian students in theater look like in the Harvard community?” “Legally Blonde” provided one unexpected yet magnificent answer.

On Nov. 5, Amazon Studios released the first season of its long-advertised reality television series, “Tampa Baes,” which follows a lesbian friend group in their late twenties as they wrestle with relationship drama, unrequited lust, and explorations of their identities. Marketed as an open exploration of Tampa Bay’s lesbian scene, “Tampa Baes” sets up implicit expectations of both diversity and entertainment. Unfortunately, its lack of clear narrative or cast chemistry results in a boring premiere and a season not entirely worth finishing.
Even prior to its release, Tampa-based critics cast doubts on the lack of varying gender expression as well as ethnic and bodily diversity within the main cast. Whilst Tampa is home to many Black, Caribbean, and immigrant residents, the cast of “Tampa Baes” is disproportionately light-skinned and femme-presenting. As “Creative Loafing Tampa” explains, “Those especially familiar with the demographics of Tampa felt that the cast was overall not representative of the city’s queer community.”
Arguably, this lack of diversity is due to Amazon’s selection of a pre-existing friend group — one that was already fairly homogenous — rather than a hand-picked representative sample. In theory, the show’s focus on an established friend group could have provided better chemistry and more entertaining drama due to preexisting relationships. However, the confusing narrative style and inauthentic interactions leave the premiere episode feeling stale.
Rather than developing a clear storyline, episode one sporadically introduces viewers to the cast with little continuity. In the opening shot, Cuppie — a nurse and Tampa-to-Orlando transplant — describes her wistfulness for the Tampa lesbian scene. She reflects on the poor relationship decisions which led to her relocation and her excitement to reconnect with her original friend group upon her impending return to the city, all of which offers a fairly heartwarming opening to the series. But when viewers see this reunion happen in the following scene, the other cast members are so unexcited and uncharismatic that the interaction feels more awkward than joyous.
The episode then steamrolls through introductions to the nine other main cast members, never taking time to highlight or distinguish their personalities. While viewers are able to clearly see which of the cast members are in relationships with one another and which couples have drama with other pairs, the lack of time spent showcasing their individual personalities makes the motivations behind their conflicts ambiguous and uncompelling.
Unlike in other successful reality shows, the characters themselves lack theatrical personalities. As a whole, they tend to speak monotonously, with bland and disinterested facial expressions. Whereas shows like “Love Island” and “Real Housewives” entrap viewers through their fast-paced, unpredictable portrayal of both lovable and hateable personalities, “Tampa Baes” is the image of neutrality.
Even in moments when the drama appears to be climaxing — for example, as Mack curses out Summer and Marissa on the way to the bar for trash-talking the rival couple of Haley and Brianna — the only footage available to viewers was a muffled audio recording of the argument taken by Shiva. With their faces omitted, it was once again impossible to see them expressing any emotion and the entire pace of the show fell flat at a crucial dramatic moment. Rather than heightening the tension and underscoring the conflicts in the group, the altercation lacked authenticity.
Paired with a botchy narrative order, this ambivalence creates a disjointed and uninteresting resulting product. While viewers can grasp the broader structure of the series, a lack of character transparency and boring relationships make “Tampa Baes” a series not worth finishing.

Mountains are everywhere: as physical features of the land, they reside on all seven continents, forming the backdrop to the history of man.As symbols of hardship and perseverance, they are equally ubiquitous. Nevertheless, seldom are mountains given the individualized attention their ubiquity would suggest they deserve. With her debut book, “Imaginary Peaks: The Riesenstein Hoax and Other Mountain Dreams,” Katie Ives ‘99 has done much to remedy this problem. Well-researched and equally well-written, “Imaginary Peaks” is a compelling read, both for experienced mountaineers and for those that have yet to attempt their first climb.
In “Imaginary Peaks,” Ives explores the cultural and philosophical significance of mountains through an in-depth look at the hoaxes that alpinist and author Harvey Manning and his friends played on the editors of climbing magazines in the 1950s and ‘60s. In particular, Ives places a focus on exploring what drove Manning and his colleagues to invent the riesenstein mountain range and their accompanying expedition to conquer its peaks in an article in Summit magazine.
Though on the surface this may seem to be too niche a topic to appeal to readers not already invested in mountaineering and its history, that could not be further from the truth. Ives does an incredible job of contextualizing the Riesenstein hoax in a long human history of imaginary peaks, connecting this one arguably obscure article to a literary tradition that includes elements of both Western and East Asian cultures and both biblical and Buddhist stories. From passages about the eternal search for the mountain topped by Eden to those detailing the many religious traditions surrounding Himalayan peaks, the exercise is an illuminating and compelling one, and Ives’ diligent research efforts pay off nicely.
This is not to say that “Imaginary Peaks” reads like one long research paper; rather, Ives’ book is easily accessible even to someone unfamiliar with many of the climbing terms she uses. Ives’ recurring focus on her personal connection to the theme of imaginary peaks gives the book a casual feel, with the passion and intimacy of one-on-one conversation.
On that note, the narrative structure of “Imaginary Peaks” is also impressive. The book is written as the story of the Riesenstein hoax and its creators, during which Ives digresses to explore related topics and stories. Particularly interesting are her retellings of the attempts to climb the real mountains off of which the Riesenstein were based, journeys which were fraught with danger. As a result, these sections of the text are actually suspenseful, and they turn Ives’ book into a page-turner, an impressive feat for a non-fiction work.
All in all, “Imaginary Peaks” is a book that punches well above its weight. For a book written about an ostensibly niche topic, it explores themes that a wide audience of readers might find interesting — even those that know nothing about climbing. Indeed, with this book, Ives gives the mountains the long look they deserve, and through this book, she will probably inspire many more.

In an ideal world, “Boyz” by Jesy Nelson featuring Nicki Minaj, would just be forgettable and boring. Instead, it highlights issues of blackfishing, cultural appropriation, and general disregard for marginalized communities.
“Boyz” is Nelson’s first single as a solo artist, following her departure from Little Mix in December 2020 due to finding the pressures and expectations of being in a girl group draining to her mental health. Little Mix has since continued as a trio, releasing new tracks like “Heartbreak Anthem” with David Guetta and “Kiss My (Uh Oh)” with Anne-Marie.
Ultimately, Nelson’s debut single is a wash. It’s generic and uninspired. Nelson adopts a tuneless attempt at rap — a shame given that her time with Little Mix proved that she is capable of beautiful and technically proficient vocals. Meanwhile, Minaj’s feature is fine, but not particularly memorable. The lyrics are repetitive, featuring marvels like “I like a bad, bad boy (boy) / You know I like a bad, bad boy (boy).” Repetition as a lyrical device can be fine, but for a sub-three-minute song, “Boyz” really drags (not to mention how much the -z in the title makes it feel dated).
Throughout the subpar lyrics, Nelson adopts a vocal affect that mimics African American Vernacular English (AAVE). The music video — also incredibly unoriginal — features aesthetics associated with trap and R&B without crediting the influence. In response to backlash she received for cultural appropriation in “Boyz,” Nelson said “But I mean, like, I love Black culture. I love Black music. That’s all I know; it’s what I grew up on,” seemingly acknowledging the similarity while also trying to shut down the issue.
Some of the criticisms of Nelson have come from closer to home. In a series of leaked Instagram DMs, Little Mix’s Leigh-Anne Pinnock appeared to accuse Nelson of blackfishing. Nelson and her former bandmates have since unfollowed each other on the platform. Other celebrities seem to have weighed in on the matter, with MNEK tweeting to support Black female artists and seemingly taking a dig at the attention Nelson has garnered since her song’s release.
However, the celebrity drama doesn’t end there, as Minaj has been quick to come to Nelson’s defense. She has made several tweets calling out “#Jelly btchs actin real MESSY!!!!!” and in an Instagram live stream with Nelson, she called Pinnock and the other members of Little Mix “jealous miserable clowns.” These attempted “take-downs” of fellow female artists who have publicly been silent on the issue are not only in poor taste, but they also do not actually address the issues at hand.
In response to accusations of blackfishing, Nelson has also said “The whole time [she] was in Little Mix [she] never got any of that,” suggesting that this is a bad faith criticism rooted in jealousy. However, the idea that these are new criticisms of Nelson’s behavior is categorically untrue. Over the last decade, she has curated a look featuring heavily tanned skin, overlined lips and afro or braided hair, often appearing onstage with darker skin than her biracial bandmates.
Jesy Nelson is by no means the first to take part in this offensive trend — Miley Cyrus adopted traditionally Black music and culture while it suited her, then returned to her blonde-haired country roots as she pleased. Similarly, Taylor Swift has utilized Black culture and Black dancers for a disrespectful joke, and Kim Kardashian has been appropriating Black hairstyles and fashions for years, cultivating a look that is decidedly not white. In this way, some have suggested that rather than blackfishing, Nelson has partaken in “ethnic smudging,” where she aims to appear mixed race or of an ambiguous ethnicity rather than specifically Black.
While Nelson’s practices clearly aren’t new, they are in no way acceptable. “Boyz” is a very shallow pastiche of great Black music. This aesthetic and tone has been overrepresented in recent years — especially by white artists claiming that they were just being “influenced” by Black artists and artistry. Jesy Nelson cannot claim ignorance, because this was not a new offense. She cannot pretend she didn’t know what she was doing because she has been told by so many people.
Regardless of her intentions, everything about her appearance in the “Boyz” music video did not intend to portray her as a white woman with brown hair. All of her choices — from her curated appearance over the last several years to the type of song she chose for her debut single and the aesthetic in the video — show a deliberate choice to engage in blackfishing and cultural appropriation. Nelson can claim that she meant well as much as she wants, but her blatant disregard of the repeated valid criticisms of her work show that she is aware of what she is doing and choosing not to care. When so many members of the Black community have informed her just how harmful what she is doing is, she doesn’t get to decide that it isn’t.
And when a feature from Nicki Minaj can’t even help her mediocre track break the Billboard Hot 100, it’s clear that engaging in blackfishing and cultural appropriation isn’t getting Nelson anywhere.

A painting student at The Cooper Union, Kelly Zutrau walked past Webster Hall every week and saw names such as Mary J. Blige and Joanna Newsom light up the marquee. Ten years later, her band Wet sold out the venue. However, Zutrau’s story did not begin at Cooper Union or at Webster Hall in 2016; her story — like this article’s — begins in Boston.
At the time of the interview with Zutrau, Wet was preparing to play the seventh show of their tour at The Sinclair in Harvard Square. For Zutrau, this show was not just another milestone in her career; it was a homecoming. Growing up in Jamaica Plain in the ’90s, Zutrau was “so Boston through and through.” Her best friend lived right in Harvard Square, and she remembers going to “the pit” with her punk friends. Just as the pit no longer draws crowds like it once did, the Boston Zutrau left is also in the past.
Due to gentrification and rising rent, the neighborhoods of Boston have undergone massive transformations in the last thirty years. When asked how it felt to return to the city, Zutrau said, “It’s bittersweet though, because I grew up in a very different Boston, you know. When I grew up in JP [Jamaica Plain], it was affordable; it was young and diverse and artistic and really cheap, and now my whole family’s been pushed out of Boston, basically. It’s just too expensive.”
Remarking further on her sentiments of homecoming, she said, “It’s beautiful and I love it, but I have this pang of sadness, too, when I’m in Boston because I just feel like it’s not really my home anymore.”
Zutrau hinted at the complexity of home in the world we occupy. “Home is definitely something I think about a lot, and something I’m striving for, and sometimes I wonder — I have this idea in my head — that once I can eventually attain this goal of owning a home that I would feel at home,” she said.
She then noted that she and her single mother moved more than a dozen times before the age of two, and she often traveled back and forth between her mother’s house and her biological dad’s house.
This notion is reflected in Wet’s sonic landscape. The band’s third studio album, “Letter Blue,” is in many ways a homecoming. In one sense, they are finding their individual sound (Wet left Columbia Records to make “Letter Blue”), but they are also exploring what their art truly means.
Zutrau said, “I was thinking what I wanted out of the third album… I really wanted it to be kind of a pure expression and not have any commercial aims, really. I just wanted to make something that I really felt good about. I was writing from much more of an honest position, I think.”
The sound of “Letter Blue” is both a progression into the electronic age using the building blocks from the first two albums (“Don’t You” and “Still Run”) and also a return to the initial joys of making music. On sonic structure, she said, “What I learned is that I really like some of the gritty, dusty, dirty-sounding depth that we put on ‘Still Run’ and I think adding that into an electronic world to deepen it and make it be this hybrid of real sounds with clean electronics was more interesting.”
“I think in a lot of ways it’s a return to form in that we went back to some of our, like, initial instincts, when we first made music and were first excited about making music.”
The use of “we” here refers to band members Joe Valle and Marty Sulkow, whom Zutrau met in college in New York. Despite Sulkow taking a brief hiatus from the group, the three have collaborated together for more than 10 years — sharing both physical and sonic spaces. For Zutrau, the friendship and artistry of Valle and Sulkow has been pivotal for her development not only as an artist, but as a human.
“I realized how special it is to have people who know you go through these different phases of your life and basically know your emotional state so deeply that there is this comfortable ease that we work with each other,” she said.
On stage, Zutrau embraces the imperfections of a live performance, despite having stage fright, and enjoys the time together with Sulkow, Valle, and the audience. “What I’ve tried to embrace is just that the whole point of a live performance is the sort of imperfections and that I try to basically visualize on stage that I’m trying to reach for these notes and for these sounds and try to replicate what’s on the album but it doesn't need to land,” she said.
Performing music that reflects her own authenticity and vulnerability, Zutrau uses her performances as an opportunity to spread joy and be an artist — be human.
Wet’s journey is just beginning. The release of “Letter Blue” signifies a new direction for the group, one which embraces an evolving sound in an evolving world. For Zutrau, the future is confusing, dynamic, yet hopeful. With her friends and her music close to her side, her journey towards home carries on.

Theater productions often rely heavily on the people behind the scenes. However, after more than a year without in-person performances, many students involved in technical theater have graduated, with no one with comparable experience to fill their place. Despite this, now that the campus has finally opened up, more student productions are offering showings, boosting the demand for student technicians.
Carlo Y. Hensch ’24 used the opportunity to be back on campus to serve as a new set designer for the production “This is Our Youth.” This is his first time leading set design for a production.
“It [has] definitely been a learning curve to start learning, especially trying to find details and trying to learn, [and] pick on the ropes,” Hensch said. “It has been a little bit of a challenge, but it’s been a good time.”
The physicality of finally being in-person is what resonates the most with Hensch. After all, during his first year at Harvard, he was forced to master basic set design virtually; however, most of the skills that a set designer like himself really need to learn and develop to further their understanding can only happen in the physical location of a theater.
Clarissa R. Briasco-Stewart ’23–’24, a current sophomore but a social junior, was able to have an in-person first-year experience and thus, is already acquainted with Harvard’s theater facilities. She is mostly involved in lighting design.
“The problem is that a lot of people graduated, and because they graduated during a virtual year, they didn’t have time or the opportunity to pass on a lot of their knowledge. Because a lot of this only works in person, like I can teach someone how to light a virtual Zoom show but it’s way, way, way, way different than lighting inputs. Some of the concepts are the same, but the actual way you do it is completely different,” Briasco-Stewart said.
Garrett M. Rolph ’22, the technical director for “Legally Blonde,” has been involved in tech theater at Harvard for almost four years, and agrees.
“I think the sentiment I’ve gotten from at least people in my class — seniors — is that we are trying to pass on a lot of the institutional memory,” Rolph said. “The pandemic stole a lot of opportunities for training.”
Despite the pandemic’s disruption of institutional memory, Thomas P. Morgan, the Technical Director for College Theatre, feels that the Office for the Arts at Harvard has always been supportive of students with little to no experience entering the stage spaces — from offering trainings with equipment to weekly collaborative production meetings. There are also paid student Technical Assistants who mentor students through their process of filling tech jobs in student productions. Moreover, the OFA even hires speciality guest artists to offer guidance to students, such as sound engineers who offered trainings for the “Legally Blonde” team and scenic artists who helped to create elaborate backdrops.
Opportunities like these are helpful in addressing yet another issue that Rolph has noticed has appeared as a result of the lack of being in person for a year.
“[The problem is] compounded because it’s not just freshmen, it’s like freshmen and sophomores and juniors that are a little less experienced,” Rolph said.
Student technicians deeply feel the impacts of the loss of an entire year of live theater. However, through the assistance of the OFA and its mentors, students like Hensch are able to find joy in their technical theater roles[,] and productions are able to run smoothly.
Morgan is also extremely grateful for the hard work of student technicians regardless of their level of experience. In an emailed statement, he wrote, “Often, what audiences see and remember is what happens onstage during a show, and the reason they can focus on that so completely is, in part, because of the tech and design team. They create the world the show inhabits.”

Some parents take their babies to baseball games. Some start them off young at concerts. Mine took me to the open houses for properties they had no intention of buying. They taught me that one of life’s simplest pleasures is driving around a rich neighborhood and judging design tastes. So when the opportunity to rank the Top Five Architectural Digest “Open Door” videos came my way, I knew what I had to do.
Reviewing celebrity homes is my Super Bowl. My “Joker.” My “Red (Taylor’s Version).”
My criteria are relatively simple. First, a house should look like a home. If the celebrity house in question looks more like a hotel, if it does not come across as lived in, I eliminate the video from the running. As a result, more contemporary designs have very little space here. Second, I think it’s a crime to be rich and without taste. Thus, celebrities should explain their choices, and their videos must demonstrate at least some sense of agency over the design and décor even if they worked with an interior designer. Bonus points are given for continuity in design and entertaining stories.
5. “Inside Dakota Johnson’s Serene Hollywood Home”
Dakota Johnson’s Hollywood Hills mid-century modern home took the internet by storm. Its wooden walls, towering bamboo garden, and array of crystals make it the closest Los Angeles can get to a cabin in the woods. Johnson’s endearing and humorous, if unstructured, tour jumps from her office with built-in bookshelves to wax mushrooms to what Johnson describes as her “weird” books to a framed photo of family friend Hunter S. Thompson nestled in a set of fake boobs. Perhaps the primary reason for the video’s 21 million views is her cozy green kitchen filled with china she says she never plans to use and not one[,] but two full bowls of limes. “I love limes. I love them. They’re great, and I love them so much,” Johnson said at the time. Later on, a Jimmy Fallon interview revealed this was a lie, and she’s actually slightly allergic to limes, which were brought in as set design. Altogether though, Johnson’s charisma and eye for unique pieces like a wobbly table made from Winston Churchill’s yacht have cemented her in the ADCU (The Architectural Digest Cinematic Universe).
4. "Inside Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz’s Oceanside Mansion"
The La Jolla mansion Alicia Keys shares with her husband Kasseem Dean, who goes by Swizz Beatz, likely seems familiar if you’ve seen any of the Iron Man movies. The geometric house built into the cliffside and designed by architect Wallace E. Cunninham has been compared to Tony Stark’s mansion by both reporters and the couple’s friends. In real life, the couple worked with interior designer Kelly Behun to make it their own. Now, I know what I said about contemporary architecture being a disqualifier in this ranking. But the genuine love Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz have for their home and each other — as seen in their “Open Door” video — breathes enough life into the house to overcome the sanitized feel most modernist design suffers from. From the stickers on the piano keys to the artistic reasoning behind their circular living room, Keys and Beatz have imbued their La Jolla mansion with their personal history. The clean lines and glass walls allow their curated art pieces (including the largest private collection of photography by Gordon Parks) and the natural décor work to warm up the otherwise industrial space. In adding their personal touches, the pair have certainly created both a home and a sculpture.
3. "Inside Tan France’s Handsomely Designed Home"
According to his “Open Door” video, the only part of Tan France’s Salt Lake City home that has not been gutted and designed entirely by him is the closet, which spans the entire length of the house’s top floor. France’s devotion to his vision is clear in his walkthrough as he describes the number of hours that went into sourcing a curved mirror that would match the white arches he installed throughout the home. These classic L.A. touches are expertly mixed with sophisticated British wallpapers and husband Rob France’s artwork, making this home a true reflection of the pair’s life together. Alongside France’s candid honesty when talking about a bathroom whose main purpose is to serve as an Instagram backdrop, it’s clear why the “Queer Eye” star deserves a spot in the top three.
2. "Inside Liv Tyler’s Gut-Renovated NYC Brownstone"
Both historic and intentional, Liv Tyler’s renovated West Village house tour comes in at number two. While gutting the original brownstone built in 1861, Tyler discovered a gilded mirror spanning floor to ceiling that now shines in her parlor-turned-playroom. Another of the house’s many highlights is the roof’s pink-tinted skylight. In the tour, Tyler admits the tinted glass was a bold choice, but the ambient pink glow it casts over the master floor proves she was right. More touches of pale pink and continuous pocket doors manage to tie the house together without taking away from the individuality of each room. With its bright blue subway tiles, ivy-covered, brick-walled patio, and several ornate fireplaces, there is no mistaking this house for anything but quintessential New York. At the same time, Liv Tyler’s array of black-and-white family photos and attic filled with “Lord of the Rings” memorabilia make the house she’s owned since the age of 24 a personal and gorgeous map of her heart.
1. "Inside Shay Mitchell’s Mediterranean-Inspired Home"
Shay Mitchell’s 1920s Spanish-style home is a unique and well-traveled masterpiece. In a thoughtful move, she spontaneously brings designer and friend, Chad Wood, into the video a few minutes in, making her one of the only celebrities to feature the interior designer she worked with. The two make clear that the house is a collaborative and ongoing project. The night before filming, for example, they stayed up until 2 a.m. to paint the tile fireplace white, and a pizza oven had just been installed in her vibrant backyard. These frequent changes are never portrayed as a burden. Instead, Mitchell’s detailed explanation of each room’s history makes clear this home is a labor of love. The design pair’s most impressive talent, however, lies in mixing materials. Gauzy curtains, cracked leather, white marble, gold mirrors, wooden candlesticks, leafy plants, wicker baskets, and a literal tree stump all in just one room might be overkill in the hands of any other design duo, but Mitchell and Wood manage to create a home that is grand but not uncomfortable, detailed but not overcrowded. In doing so, they secure their spot as the AD champs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“Native American history is American history, and it is only by recognizing that history that we can build a future that is equitable and inclusive,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, in a video uploaded to her Twitter on Nov. 1.
That idea, though resonant, was certainly not what a group of vandals must have had in mind when they covered artwork created by Northwestern University’s Native American and Indigenous Student Alliance (NAISA), meant to commemorate Native American Heritage Month, with anti-Indigenous messaging.
Painting “The Rock” has long been a Northwestern tradition in which students guard an old campus fountain resembling a boulder for 24 hours before painting it to promote a relevant cause or event.
For the first time in its history, NAISA organized an event to paint The Rock for Native American Heritage Month. The artwork included a jingle dress dancer to represent healing, red hands to recognize the ongoing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women crisis, and a land acknowledgement for Anishinaabe tribes—which include the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi— reading, “You are on Anishinaabe land.”
Two days later, NAISA’s artwork had been vandalized. The land acknowledgement was changed to read, “You are on China’s land.” Another message which was painted on The Rock read, “Ojibwe? No way!” Other NAISA messaging — including “Bring our children home!” and “Happy Native American Heritage Month!” — was scribbled over with red and black spray paint.
Art and activism go hand in hand, as we were reminded in the wake of global Black Lives Matter protests. The role of art as resistance was evident when murals across the country were created to commemorate the movement, from the 12-foot black and white portrait of George Floyd painted on the street where he was murdered to the giant yellow letters spelling out “Black Lives Matter” painted too many times to count, including in front of Trump Tower in New York City and on a road near the White House in Washington, D.C.
The defacement of artwork so deeply entwined with cultural pride and identity is a violent act. And yet, it cannot be called unexpected. The very reason we need a space like Native American Heritage Month to provide a platform for Native people to tell their own stories, ironically, enables these stories to become targets for a continuation of anti-Indigenous hate.
The general American public understands very little about contemporary Native life. This is something I have experienced personally, as an enrolled member of the Osage Nation. I have been asked by non-Native people if I could switch tribes, and on many occasions asked what percentage Native American I am. I have been told more than once that I do not “look Native,” which begs the question: What does a Native American look like?
The lack of knowledge about Native people is the result of continuous and intentional erasure of Native perspective by the American public. One need only look so far as the standard American school curriculum: What did you learn about Native Americans in your history classes? I would not be surprised if you were to mention the Trail of Tears, the First Thanksgiving, or the story of Columbus sailing to America — all of them more than likely told from a non-Native perspective.
These stories directly result in erasure of Native history and perspective. They tell a grossly simplified version of a diverse and complex past. Furthermore, they crowd out contemporary Native individuals and communities telling their own histories. Equally problematic is the absence of academic curricula that describes Native life today, enshrining the idea of Native Americans as a figment of the past. The result is an American public that is spoon-fed a few textbook lines about pre-Columbus Native life.
Several states, including Massachussettes, are beginning to address these knowledge deficits through expanded school curriculum. At the same time, many school boards across the country are facing pushback for beginning to engage with a deeper acknowledgement of America’s past, just as Northwestern’s Native students did with their art.
As they enter a college community, many Native students simultaneously leave behind a strong point of cultural connection: Native relatives, friends, reservations. We remember these communities as we enter our campus spaces; we represent these communities, just as the Northwestern students did through their paintings on The Rock. The destruction of that artwork is devastating. Those hateful words do not leave us.
NAISA has decided to leave the vandalized messages untouched on The Rock. This powerful statement is one that gives Native American Heritage Month a darker edge: As we seek to elevate Native demands and Native voices, there are always people who seek to silence them.
Northwestern’s director of the Center for Native American and Indigenous Research and Medill professor Patty Loew, who is a member of the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe, said, “We don’t need people to lift us up,” during a post-vandalism reflection event at The Rock. “We need people to have our backs. So when you leave tonight, think about the ways you can support us in our efforts. Because we are demanding change, and we need allies.”

Before she steps onstage, videos from Lucy Dacus’s childhood play on loop: In one, she’s a baby with a shock of dark hair, crawling around a kitchen. In another, she’s a child singing in a choir, grinning with her baby teeth.
The video changes to static and Dacus emerges from the wings. She’s holding a mug of tea, from which she sips between songs.
“You must know what tea I’m drinking,” she tells the audience after one song. “I’m drinking
Throat Coat tea,” says Dacus, and takes another sip.
Lucy Dacus’s newest album, “Home Video,” was released in late June via Matador Records. In it, Dacus’s skill as a vocalist and lyricist shine through as she returns to sites of memory, romance, and nostalgia. “Home Video” is the singer-songwriter’s third studio album, following her sophomore album, “Historian” — which was released in 2018 — and her 2016 debut “No Return.”
The “Home Video” tour arrived in Boston on Oct. 16 at Kenmore Square’s House of Blues. As Dacus notes onstage, it is “the biggest headlining show [they’ve] ever done” — and, as she adds, they sold out. Dacus is supported by her band, consisting of Jacob Blizard on guitar, Dominic Angelella on bass, and Sarah Goldstone on keyboard and back up vocals.
Dacus plays each track from “Home Video” and features a few hits from “Historian,” a cover of Edith Piaf’s “La Vie en Rose” (released as a single in 2019), and “I Don’t Wanna Be Funny Anymore,” one of her earliest hits off 2016’s “No Return.” Sonically, Dacus remains faithful to the original recordings. Her voice and her incisive, emotional lyrics are the undoubted heart of the performance, cutting clean through round, resonant instrumentals.
Onstage, Dacus excels at cultivating the narrative build of each track. She often starts quietly — a soft smile, a low voice — and gradually constructs intricate landscapes of crescendoing sound and feeling. She layers emotions and harmonies with equal deftness, culminating in a rich pulse of music so full as to be almost unbearable. It’s a build like an open scream. Then, a long fade into quiet, the crowd holding still, a persistent residual buzz like the static on a cassette tape.
The show’s lighting is a skillful complement to Dacus’s sound — usually, the lights remain constant for each track, providing a strong backdrop to the music without overtaking or distracting from the performance itself. Each track also features an animation which plays on the small screen at the back of the stage, where Dacus’s childhood played out before the show. Some of the tracks off “Home Video” are accompanied by an image from the album’s cover, a whirring tape on a blue background, reminiscent of loading screens from the 90s and the early 2000s. During “Thumbs,” one of the album’s lead singles, the animation features a pair of outlined, gently tracing hands. On another, it’s a pair of swings, fireflies appearing in the grass; others, it’s the album cover from “Historian.” The animations are subtle and visually striking, effectively setting the stage for the emotional world of each track.
Dacus closes the set with “Night Shift,” the opening track of “Historian” and one of her most popular songs. The audience screams along with her during the chorus, lyrics which feel particularly poignant a few years after the song’s debut: “In five years, I hope the songs feel like covers,” sings Dacus, “dedicated to new lovers.”
She doesn’t make the audience wait long before the encore, beginning with a cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing In The Dark,” released as a single in September of 2019 in honor of Springsteen’s 70th birthday. She ends with a new, unreleased piece centering on her hometown of Richmond, Va. She asks the audience not to record out of respect, entrusting them very sincerely with the responsibility. At a 2019 performance at the Sinclair in Cambridge, Dacus introduced the then-unreleased track “Thumbs” in the same way.
As she continues to speak about the new song, someone runs up to a man in the back, who had been holding up his phone to record. They point a finger at his camera and berate him, shouting, “Respect her!”
This connection between Dacus and her audience is evident throughout the performance. A couple slow dances in the back of the room during “Night Shift” and “Dancing in the Dark.” During “Please Stay,” one of the album’s more emotional tracks, the room gets quiet. A man near the front sobs silently. Someone in the audience shouts, “Pay for my therapy!” — a harsh ask, perhaps, for an indie musician you’ve never met. But Dacus responds graciously, sincerely: “I wish I could pay for all of your therapy.”
The “Home Video” tour continues through the end of October, making stops in New York and Washington D.C., with Dacus overseas to tour throughout Europe starting in March of 2022.

Fall may bring with it Halloween and Thanksgiving, sure, but more importantly, it represents the beloved, months-long period where it is culturally acceptable for young adults to wear Doc Martens (or any boot of similar likeness) on a daily basis. But how did Doc Martens overcome being typecast as an essential item of the emo-high school aesthetic to become a fashion staple? With so many shades and varieties, it is not at all surprising that the boot has become a must-have for middle school outcasts, the preppiest of college students, and everyone in between.
In considering a boot with such universal appeal, the style, color, and material you choose says quite a lot about who you are. It’s no horoscope, but the pair of Docs you rock does say a lot about your perceived personality. So, instead of taking an internet quiz to tell you what pair of Docs you are based on your personality, listen to a much more trustworthy way of pigeonholing your identity instead. Let me tell you what your personality is based on the pair of Doc Martens you own.
Classic Black Docs:
Generally, you wear as much black as possible. You own corduroy pants. You’ve listened to Mitski at least once in the past week. Classic Doc owners are unapologetic: “Yes, I own and wear the most recognizable pair of Doc Martens — so what?” If you own these Docs, you are here for practicality, comfort, and versatility. You’ve probably owned the same pair for years, and the environment thanks you for it. You use them to aesthetically jump in October leaves while you simultaneously stomp on the patriarchy. Everyone loves you.
Chelsea Docs:
YAWWWNNNN — oh sorry. These Docs are just really boring. Don’t worry, this is coming from a place of self-deprecation, as I own this style myself. But even I can admit that these are the vanilla of the Docs catalogue. People own these for one of two reasons: They are too scared to own classic Docs because they're “too edgy,” but still want to stay fashionably relevant, or they want something to wear with every outfit for every occasion. Seriously, these Docs can be dressed up or down so easily. Sometimes boring can have its benefits.
“Edgy” Platform Docs:
Please speak up — I cannot hear you over the Phoebe Bridgers songs being blasted at all times in your presence. People who wear platform Docs are the coolest people in existence. Everyone immediately wants to be their friend. If you wear these, the fashion industry steals runway ideas from the creative outfits you wear on the streets of New York City while you chase after your art, music, or design dreams. Confident in every way, the world looks up to you for inspiration on how to be unapologetic.
Colored Docs:
People with colored Docs dress in one of two ways: All black with their boots being the sole pop of color, or with the most random mismatch of color, pattern, and texture layered into one outfit. These people are artsy, risk-takers, and free-spirited enough to invest in a pair of Docs that makes putting together outfits a daily puzzle of color theory. You challenge the rest of us to loosen up and indulge in some color every once in a while — even if it's impractical and doesn’t match half our wardrobe.
Earthy-colored Docs:
These boots scream, “I listen to the Lumineers,” or “Home” by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.” Or the entirety of Taylor Swift’s “Folklore.” You get the picture. These are the quintessential boots of people who climb trees and hike mountains. They ride their bike to the local café and talk to the barista about how their garden is doing while their coffee with oak milk is being made. If you own these, you are probably warm, free-loving, and fun to be around. So, thanks!

Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble… or, something like that? At any rate, the spookiest time of the year is upon us — and no, it’s not midterms. After going through the scariest couple of years of our lives, most of us can be more optimistic about this year’s Halloween: The world has gotten a little bit calmer, a great deal of us are fully vaccinated, and, obviously, this means that Harvard undergrads all the way from our beloved Quadrangle to the far reaches of Mather and Dunster will be participating in some Halloween festivities across campus and Boston. But what was worn? Looking past the fairies, angels, and devils that flooded the streets of Cambridge, here are the top five Halloween costumes and themes that Harvard's campus should have been teeming with this past Oct. 31.
5. Bernie Sanders Mittens Meme
Yes! This was 2021! Way back when, in January of this year, politician Bernie Sanders grabbed a hold of pop culture with just a stoic pose and a deceptively exciting pair of mittens. Easy to replicate, low maintenance, and a great conversation starter with pop culture nerds and Government concentrators alike, the “Mittened Bernie Sanders” is a great throwback to the beginning of the year, when society first started to slowly recover from a worldwide pandemic. All you need to accomplish it is a brown puffer, a blue surgical mask, and[,] of course, mittens.
4. “BRITNEY BITCH”
“It’s Britney Bitch.” After a tumultuous year spent fighting to end her conservatorship, Britney Spears is [once again][CUT] taking over headlines[, and she has the entire world paying attention.][CUT] In light of this refreshed focus on her and her life, we may expect Halloween parties this year filled with homages to “Oops!... I Did It Again” (red latex suit), or “...Baby One More Time,” (the classic schoolgirl outfit completed with certain poofy pink hair accessories). [Maybe the least we, as a campus, can do is support her through this time by attempting to recreate her most iconic late 1990s and early 2000s looks.][CUT]
3. Decades Themes
Y2K, ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s: The options are endless. Taking it further back than January of 2021 and Bernie Sanders, decade[-]inspired pieces are honestly such a classy costume choice. Pull out all the stops! Bring back the leather pants and gelled up hair, the swirly patterns and the knee high boots! Retro is in, and a decades themed Halloween costume is that opportunity to recycle the clothes that you currently have stuffed in your far-too-small dorm closet[, and dress to impress][CUT].
2. “Squid Game” Jumpsuits
“Mugoonghwa kkot e pi yeot seubnida.” “Squid Game” has captured the attention of almost everyone who has access to or knows someone who has access to a Netflix account, and for good reason: The show absolutely delivers on its political undertones and messaging, casting, and (most importantly for the purposes of this article) its costume design. The now-iconic combination of a green tracksuit and white slip-on vans utilizes two common wardrobe items that can easily be transformed into a themed costume that most TV watchers of this year will understand. So, this Halloween, dust off the white slip-ons and straighten out that tracksuit from when you tried to do sports. Also, watch “Squid Game.”
1. “WandaVision”
As a part of Marvel’s Phase Four, the studio spent the summer releasing a slate of highly-acclaimed TV series. Of those, “WandaVision'' was certainly one of the best. For good reason: People literally would not stop talking about it. We could discuss the gargantuan budget for the show, the attention to detail, or the acting, but let’s talk about the Halloween episode. Namely, Wanda and Vision’s vintage Scarlet Witch and Vision costumes. Literally nothing more needs to be said. It’s a cute couple costume idea, and fairly easy to execute.
BONUS: Loki’s TVA Jumpsuit
Continuing on this Marvel TV trend, “Loki” also provided viewers with a uniquely “you wouldn’t understand this if you don’t know the show” costume: the muted brown/beige Time Variance Authority (TVA) jumpsuit. The big question is: Will lowly civilians be able to pull it off as well as Tom Hiddleston does in the show?

It has been 20 years since “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone” was released, and on the anniversary of the beloved franchise, it is a difficult milestone to celebrate. The stories are still wonderful and exciting to consume, even magical. The movies are technically strong, with thoughtful direction and special effects that can still wow today. The series also features excellent child acting and is one of the best large-scale book-to-screen adaptations ever. But — and it’s a big but — in recent years the Harry Potter franchise has increasingly been used to perpetrate actual harm to real people.
JK Rowling has been openly transphobic, using her platform to express views that minimize the struggles and journeys that trans people face, saying that she does not believe the discrimination trans people face is real and even tweeting, “I’d march with you if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.” Over the past few years, much of J.K. Rowling’s public persona has been dedicated to attacking trans people. She has posted long blog posts about “reasons to be worried about the new trans activism,” framed trans people as a threat to lesbians (though she is ostensibly straight), and directed followers to a website that sells badges with slogans like “F**k your pronouns” and “Notorious Transphobe.” Views like these, amplified by such a famous celebrity, impact legislation surrounding transgender people’s safety and right to transition in the UK today.
Rowling’s public transphobia has been confusing and heartbreaking for a lot of people who grew up on her books. The “Harry Potter” books and movies were formative for multiple generations — Harry Potter tattoos are so common they’re practically generic, Harry Potter merchandise is almost universally available, and “What’s your Hogwarts house?” is an almost ubiquitously-understood icebreaker.
Sure, the books and movies are technically good, but nostalgia often elevates them above what they are to this weird, untouchable pedestal. “Harry Potter” has been successful for years because of its immersive world building — from an easily understandable housing system, to its “chosen one” narrative, to its characters that invite audience projection — although almost entirely for white viewers.
Indeed, there are many flaws with the work that have been widely expounded. Unfortunately, Rowling’s transphobia is very present in her text. From her description of Umbridge’s large stubby fingers and surprisingly high-pitched voice to her decision to write Neville’s boggart being Snape dressed in women’s clothes as a laugh line, hints of transphobia have always been present in “Harry Potter.” Similarly, Rowling’s depictions of characters beyond the white, English middle-class leave a lot to be desired. A YouTube video compiling every time a person of color speaks in Harry Potter is barely six minutes long. Rowling’s depiction of female characters also favours pitting girls against each other: Hermione, Ginny and Luna are all “not like other girls” as they primarily socialize with boys and distinguish themselves from the other seemingly silly, gossiping and emotional girls at Hogwarts. There is a consistent lack of care throughout the series, and while it is not a cardinal sin for a work to be less than completely inclusive and diverse, it is unfair that a work that is so thoroughly lacking in this department is so often heralded as so “perfect.”
Again, some of Rowling’s hateful views can be hard to reconcile with a story that has meant a lot to so many people. But it is necessary to be aware of the deep flaws in the art that many of us consumed during our formative years. It is even more important to stop giving this woman money and power to spread hate.
Ultimately, these criticisms largely address the books and Rowling’s behavior as a celebrity since — but what about the films? Daniel Radcliffe, for example, has been outspoken in support of trans rights. In this way, the majority of the cast and crew likely do not share Rowling’s hateful views, but they are also unlikely to still be earning money from the movies made from her stories while Rowling definitely is.
If you want to enjoy the DVDs you already own or stream the films when they inevitably go on Disney Plus, that’s a personal choice. But Harry Potter will now forever be linked with its creator’s transphobia, along with the sexist undertones and erasure of people of color that preceded Rowling’s Twitter rants. In other words — we could have seen this coming.

This year’s Halloweekend coincided with aggressive rain storms, families visiting campus, and the graduate student worker strike. But beyond the Harvard bubble, this year’s Halloween was the first to be celebrated outside of isolation in a while. With the combined powers of designer wardrobes and the best makeup artists money can buy, the celebrities we care so much about put forward their best Halloween looks in honor of our favorite pagan holiday. Here’s a list of the top five celebrity Halloween costumes from this past weekend, but with a twist. This year’s edition: costumes that college students could actually afford putting together.
5. Blackpink’s Lisa as that laser-shooting doll from “Squid Game”
Would it really be Halloween 2021 if we didn’t see at least a few costumes from this year’s most-discussed TV series? Lisa from Blackpink nailed the “Red Light, Green Light” doll costume, complete with a Squid Game invitation card hair clip. Black loafers and knee-high white socks are also now staples in every dark-academia enthusiast’s (or Hum10 student’s) wardrobe. 
4. Mindy Kaling as Elle Woods from “Legally Blonde”
Mindy Kaling’s mind… the fact that she dressed up as our very own Natalie Choo ’22 from Harvard ASAP’s production of “Legally Blonde?” Amazing. Incredible. Show-stopping.
3. Hailey Bieber as Britney Spears
Do any of us have the means to hire those makeup and hairstylists with verified Instagram accounts? Probably not (yet). But, Hailey Bieber’s “...Baby One More Time” look could easily be achieved by the average college student: pigtail braids with pom-pom hair clips, a gray cardigan with a white crop top, and a pencil to effortlessly twirl in your hand. The red latex catsuit, probably not. Nevertheless, a great reminder to empower women and celebrate the legend that is Britney Spears.
2. Conan Gray as Rodrick Heffley from “Diary of a Wimpy Kid”
To the girls and the gays, this one’s for you. Conan Gray let us all know that he very much understands the dichotomy between what is considered “our Rodrick” and “not our Rodrick” with his rendition of the drum-banging, slightly illiterate older brother from everyone’s favorite elementary school book fair series. Gray sported a “Löded Diper” crop top (which we may or may not see in Urban Outfitters in the near future), black bootcut jeans with a gold trouser chain, and Doc Martens to complete the look.
1. Steve Buscemi as Lenny Wosniak from “30 Rock”
Backwards red cap. Matching red jacket, unzipped to show the gray “Music *lightning symbol* Music” shirt. Skateboard propped over his shoulder. CNN gave it the “2021 award for the most meta Halloween costume.” (Dear CNN, please never use the word ‘meta’ ever again. Signed, everyone). Dressing up as Lenny Wosniak, a character he portrayed, from the early 2000s sitcom “30 Rock,” Steve Buscemi made it clear that he is, in fact, one of the kids. Not only that, but he actually handed out candy to trick-or-treaters! What a guy.

So rarely does a band come along that is so extraordinary that it becomes something wholly greater than itself. After 50 years of chart-topping albums, world tours, and an enduring fanbase, ABBA is no longer just a team of creative people, but a sensation, driven by a vision that has transcended a genre or era.
This year, the timeless phenomenon that is ABBA is returning to the music scene and the stage with their latest album, “Voyage.” Their new songs and high-tech virtual revival concert have been almost a half-century in the making.
The group’s genesis can be traced back to 1966 in Sweden, when musicians Björn Ulvaenus and Benny Andersson met and began songwriting together. The pair became regular collaborators, and by the spring of 1969, both men had met the women who would become their wives and the other half of ABBA: Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. Anderrson and Ulvaenus sensed early on that they had stumbled onto something special, and that spark eventually grew into the quartet that became ABBA — an acronym of the members’ names.
Their first major milestone was in 1972, when their song “People Need Love” garnered a small following in Sweden. Emboldened by their mild success, the group entered another song, “Ring Ring,” into a Swedish musical festival. That song became a major hit in Sweden and several other European countries, and the next year their single “Waterloo” carried them all the way to Eurovision finals, culminating in an triumphant win for ABBA and their first chance to shine on the world stage. The song, which describes the battle of Waterloo as a metaphor for a romantic relationship, contains the key elements that would come to characterize ABBA songs — a charming spin on a romantic theme infused with joy and nostalgia, all to the tune of chorusing harmonies and jazz and disco-inspired instrumentation.
Their next album, 18 months later, was a resounding success, with hits like “SOS” and “Mamma Mia” reaching worldwide fame. And yes, that’s the same “Mamma Mia” of Meryl Streep and Amanda Seyfried renown. The actresses star in the 2008 movie version of the hugely popular “Mamma Mia!” musical that premiered in 1999 and incorporated ABBA songs into its soundtrack and story.
By 1976, the world was caught up in ABBA fever, and the group had asserted themselves as one of the largest pop phenomena of the era. Songs like “Fernando” and “Dancing Queen” were immediate hits, with the latter being the only ABBA song to ever achieve Number 1 on a US chart. “Dancing Queen” is the quintessential ABBA Song, released as they were rising to global stardom. The song itself is full of youthful bliss echoed through the effervescent melodies. The song paints a spirited and vivacious scene through its lyrical verses as it crescendos to a jubilant chorus: “You are the dancing queen / Young and sweet / Only 17.” Perhaps the song itself represents ABBA’s own coming-of-age experience. The group was still finding their voice and their place in the music scene, but their success was unquestionable and they were the world’s stars.
Their fourth album, “Arrival,” featured songs like “Knowing Me, Knowing You” and “Money, Money, Money.” The album is heavily inspired by the disco era it hails from, with spectacular musical effects that add a sense of drama and passion to each song. In this album, ABBA explored a greater breadth of subject matter, and their songs encompass themes of love, friendship, memories, regret, and many more on the spectrum of human emotion. The colorful harmonies and upbeat background tracks imbue their songs with a sense of carefree exuberance that has become a signature part of ABBA music.
In 1978, the group came to the U.S. for a promotional campaign, producing iconic songs like “Summer Night City” and “Chititiqua” and another album, “Voulez Vous.” While several of their songs had already achieved success in America, this year truly launched ABBA into worldwide stardom.
Their next single, “Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight),” released in the fall of 1979, was hugely successful as well, prompting ABBA to go on tour in the U.S. and Canada. The song is an exemplary representation of their musical brilliance, with all the hallmarks of an ABBA bop — a jazzy beat that climaxes in a catchy chorus, layered vocals singing about romance, and a hint of longing juxtaposed with a lively tune.
Over the next decade, the band churned out hit after hit, with albums like “Super Trouper” and “The Visitors” containing a more mature and diverse filmography that still had the same key ABBA elements of joy and nostalgia amid the rich instrumentation popularized by their era. By 1982, both couples had split up, and the band felt it was time to move on.
One of their last songs, “The Day Before You Came” (1982), conveys the band’s growth while still harkening back to their past era. The tinge of melancholy present in many of their songs is brought to the forefront in this lyrical ballad. The song is firmly in the minor key, and vocals and music are infused with a wistful, bittersweet tone. This song is more introspective than the rest, as it perhaps represented a point when ABBA themselves were reflecting on their place in the musical canon and coming to terms with the fact that their lives were forever different after their worldwide success.
The golden era of ABBA may have passed, but their music and influence lives on. In the 1990s, they released a compilation album “ABBA Gold,” which has remained on the UK Official Albums Chart ever since, making it the longest-running album of all time to feature on a Top 100 list. In 2010, ABBA was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a rightful spot for the band.
The band that “captured the hearts of people around the world,” according to the official ABBA website, returns this year with new music and an all-new virtual show. Their new discography includes instant classics like “I Still Have Faith in You” and “Ode To Freedom,” capturing the essence of their band’s history through the rich and textured melodies and the synergism of the vocals and instrumentation.
It takes courage to jump back into the limelight, especially with ABBA being one of the most famous musical groups of all time. With the whole world watching, fans old and new have welcomed their music with open arms.
Their new music is more mature and complex, and the vocals provided by the talented Fältskog and Lyngstad are deeper and richer. Yet the songs still capture the essence of what made ABBA music great. For example, “Don’t Shut Me Down” features measured verses full of reminiscing lyrics that build to a radiant chorus infused with pleasure and pathos.
This last album is a satisfying conclusion to their long and successful career. ABBA took us on a wonderful musical journey, and their farewell album, tinged with bittersweet joy at a musical life well-lived, is a soulful and magnificent ending.
ABBA truly has become a band for all times and all people. Their music, infused with a sense of genuine lightness and spirit with an occasional note of melancholy, harkens back to a past age, conjuring up some of that beloved nostalgia for the disco era of the ‘70s and ‘80s, but it also feels timeless and ever relevant. The music itself is simply good, too, featuring complex melodies, clever lyrics, skillful instrumentation, and talented vocals.
On the radio, in films, on TikTok, in college parties, and even in my own collection of vinyls, ABBA features prominently. With this farewell album concluding a fabulous discography, ABBA has truly made an eternal impression on the world. Thank you for the music, ABBA. You will be remembered.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Monday, the newly elected Cambridge City Council explored a proposal to restrict the political participation of developers and those who favor development. We posit, however, that the amendment in question is far too underdeveloped. The proposal would limit campaign donations from developers and those who favor development to $200, while all other actors would remain subject to the current legal limit of $1,000. There may be many laudable paths to campaign finance reform but this proposal, emerging as almost tyrannical in nature, is several steps removed from any of them.
Perhaps most outrageous about this plan of action is the fact that the proposed restriction would apply not only to developers, but would extend to anyone who is merely in favor of development. Whenever the council considers development, there are actors who support it and those who oppose it. To restrict donations from one side of a political fight but not the other is inimical to the kind of viewpoint neutrality that is absolutely essential to democracy. At the most basic level, this overreach is more than enough to earn our opposition.
But even if the council had narrowed its proposal to developers only, this move would still mark an overstepping of boundaries. We are more sympathetic to the goal of preventing direct financial conflicts of interest. But ultimately, every Cambridge resident has an interest in what our government does. Why single out this one conflict over every other?
In other words, we condemn any targeted restriction on a single group’s capacity to make financial campaign contributions: Viewpoint neutrality in this domain is, quite simply, requisite for a functional political process, no matter the targeted group.
Even still, this specific overreach is made even more offensive by the fact that the council has chosen to take a jab at an issue as important as development which threatens to exacerbate a housing shortage in a city that cannot afford it.
Housing scarcity is one of our city’s most devastating problems. It’s a source of deprivation and anguish to many. And it is a problem that is fueled, or sometimes even caused, by restrictive zoning and reflexive opposition to development. In throwing daggers at development, then, the council’s resolution has taken a potentially harmful political stance.
We are a pro-housing board. In Cambridge, that means a thoughtful openness to development. It means open discussion, and it means electing, and perhaps contributing financially to, candidates who devote themselves to enabling sustainable development in a city that can make such processes very difficult. It emphatically does not mean overturning long-standing principles in an effort to artificially tip the scales of the political process.
This proposal is wrong both in practice and in principle, and we hope that the Cambridge City Council will abandon its pursuit. Cambridge does not need this proposal developed into law.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
These days, I frequent the Dunkin’ across the street from my dorm in Kirkland House because the dining hall’s Fogbuster doesn’t really do the trick for me anymore. Just a few days ago, I was waiting for my coffee with my violin case strapped to my back, en route to rehearsal. A high school student (I surmise), standing six-feet away, cheerily interrupted me from my exhausted mid-week daze.
“What instrument do you play?” he inquired.
“Violin,” I replied, a bit startled. I glanced up to his intrigued expression.
“How long have you been playing?” he followed up enthusiastically.
I paused for a few moments. “Erm. Fifteen years?”
Actually, it has been over 16 years, but I’d messed up the math in the moment. I know better than anyone that I started playing when I was six and that I’m now 22. Nonetheless, it felt surprisingly odd to have to attach a number — even as innocuous as age — to something so essential in my life. Mathematically, for each passing year, the fraction of my life that I did not play violin becomes a smaller and smaller sliver. What a delightful thought.
My older sister started playing the violin when I was an over-energetic three-year-old. She would give living room recitals to an audience of three — mom, dad, me. These moments have been frozen in time by the grainy video of my dad’s early 2000s camcorder. But I don’t need to rewatch the vintage footage to remind myself what I did after nearly every one of these performances: Upon triumphantly playing the last note of her piece, met with an eruption of applause in our living room concert hall, I would rise from my spot on the rug, walk towards the “stage” right up next to my sister, and take a bow alongside her.
In the midst of Harvard’s rich and vibrant music community, I think a lot about why I started the violin in the first place. I find myself wondering how much agency I actually had in choosing the instrument or in starting one at all, what role serendipity played along the way in my journey as a musician. I haven’t figured out much for certain, but what I am confident in is that my admiration for my sister was an essential piece in my origin story as a musician. Over the years, we’ve found many occasions to perform as a sibling duo, and bow together, in our living room, as well as on slightly grander stages.
When the world went remote, musical collaboration and performance did too. Like many, I missed the vitality and energy of live music. I craved the electric feeling of performing for an audience, large or small.
During that period, I spent a lot of time playing a piece for solo violin called the Chaconne, composed by a decently well-known musician named Bach. It’s a work that has been widely studied and performed for hundreds of years.
I think this sentiment by Johannes Brahms, another well-known composer, captures it best: “The Chaconne is, in my opinion, one of the most wonderful and most incomprehensible pieces of music. Using the technique adapted to a small instrument, the man writes a whole world of the deepest thoughts and most powerful feelings. If I could picture myself writing, or even conceiving, such a piece, I am certain that the extreme excitement and emotional tension would have driven me mad.”
In the absence of opportunities to play music with and for others, I feel so blessed that a piece of music like the Chaconne could keep me company. Alone in my room, a music stand, a small wooden box called a violin, and endless possibilities. Forgive me, it’s hard not to be romantic about music.
This column is about memoirs, and how memoirs capture those very memories in our lives that are deepest and dearest, and turn them into prose. Memory is a funny thing: it’s not really chronological, it plays tricks on us, and it’s influenced by all sorts of factors.
Reading memoirs of others, and in that process beginning to think about how we’d craft a memoir of our own, brings out those fondest, most formative memories that find a way to stand the test of time. Like the narrative structure of many memoirs, our lives aren’t always experienced chronologically. The salient, beautiful moments stand out, and we often glance back towards them as we move forwards. Where may these memories lie for you?
Once in a while, when I bring my violin up to my chin to play, images of those bows I took with my sister long before my own first violin lesson come flooding back. I don’t expect that will ever change.

“Math 1B, B for the bonding.” We laugh. Our bodies are still recovering from senior years and gap years spent behind a screen while our minds recalibrate to a world of in-person programming and daily math homework — so banal, but so bizarre to a class that spent the last year in an antithesis of banality dictated by Covid-19. As we integrate over 2 a.m. integrals, we discover a way to navigate the superficiality of conversations cut short by schedules and diluted by social ambition. We forge friendships that run deeper than the standard Harvard introduction.
Some of us find our best friends over the worst problem sets. Some of us bond as we look out for each other on a Saturday night, so none of us have to comprise the terrifying statistics of campus assault we’ve heard floating around. The rest of us find our closest friendships in Harvard’s affinity spaces, tied together by commonalities grounded in marginalization and generational trauma. And if you’re lucky, a morning dining hall exchange gives way to an honest conversation about skipped meals, compromised hours of sleep, or the fear of a rapidly declining number on the weighing scale. The value of solidarity in our shared struggles is undeniable, and we don’t hesitate to leverage it.
For many of us at Harvard, our struggles function as much more than a social lubricant — they delineate individual identity. Even before stepping foot on campus, we’re made to internalize the idea that adversity is an asset at this school. In a sea of accomplished individuals with rounded passions, a flair for articulation, and untethered drive, how do you set yourself apart? Do you have a story of struggle to tell? A personal justification for your intended concentration? A nuanced narrative to hold your defining accomplishments above the tide of equalization? And as always, there are groups of students that feel a disproportionately heavier burden to justify their place here.
Harvard may employ affirmative action and contextual consideration when it chooses who walks through its doors, but it does very little to even the playing ground once we’re inside. Freshmen from underfunded high schools vie for the same spaces as their preparatory school counterparts in capped seminars, competitive club applications, and positions of leadership. For these freshmen, the competitive distinction of personal adversity isn’t an added feather in the cap, it might just be their way of keeping up with the tide.
We all come from different starting points but play the same game of numbers, and if you haven’t been exposed to transformative intellectual pursuits or exclusive extracurricular experiences, you fall back on the next best thing you can bring to the table: adversity. Academia is no stranger to the distanced fetishization of suffering, and Harvard is no stranger to academia’s fallacies. Harvard is also innately transactional. In an environment where time is outpaced by opportunity, we’re compelled to quantify the value of every experience. So, we commodify our lived experiences as activity spaces on a resume. Marginalization, financial hardship, and personal tragedy function as cover letters to our identity.
For one, I’ve been guilty of playing “the international card.” When being international means coming from the Global South, I’m told that my card is especially powerful at this institution. In bearing direct witness to personal adversity and social inequity, my card contributes more than ethnic diversity or international perspective. My card is multifold — I’m a woman from a country where menstruation is still stigmatized, my skin is generously melanated, and my lived experiences are the substance of much of academia’s forages into global disparities. “Use the card,” I’ve been told. I shouldn’t have to feel guilty, because these struggles were real, and deserve to be considered. The struggles that stripped me of power now offer it back to me, and it’s an opportunity I deserve to leverage.
In many ways, I understand — and perhaps reinforce — this power. As we share reflections in my freshman seminar on mental illness, I appreciate the personal encounters that drove each of us to this space. In conversations on health policy, I prioritize voices that have lost loved ones to the disparities we speak of in theory. I love the friends I’ve made over dissecting problem sets and deconstructing problematic institutions.
But this power isn’t an upper bound to the space I occupy at Harvard, or my identity beyond it.
At an institution where merit is the baseline and adversity the outlier, it’s tempting to define myself in terms of the latter, especially if it provides context to my lack of summers spent in labs or rigorous AP courses. I want to believe that this temptation isn’t binding to my right to opportunity. My insight into an issue may be informed by my lived experiences, but not contained within them. My belonging at this school is not the sum total of my personal essay on a defining obstacle. My connections to the people that surround me are colored by more than our ability to hurt the same or navigate similar hurdles.
It’s a steeper learning curve than a saddle point approximation, but I’m beginning to redefine myself outside of these bounds. I hope to do so in a space that doesn’t conflate my past with my potential, in an institution that recognizes adversity to equalize opportunity, but doesn’t paint it as a substitute for merit.

Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine held a rally in the Yard Monday afternoon to call on Harvard to divest its holdings in companies allegedly "complicit" in human rights abuses against Palestinians.
Protesters chanted phrases like “Free, free Palestine,” “No more money for Israel’s crimes,” and “No peace on stolen land” as they marched from the John Harvard Statue to Widener Library before concluding at Massachusetts Hall.
Outside of Massachusetts Hall, organizers from HOOP and other activist groups, including the Ethnic Studies Coalition and Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign, gave speeches in front of a crowd of roughly 60 protesters and spectators and delivered a letter to University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s office in the building.
HOOP is a student activist group established last year that calls on the University to disclose and divest all indirect and direct holdings in companies tied to Israel’s presence in Palestine.
HOOP organizers Malaika K. Tapper ’23 — a Crimson Magazine editor — and Nadine S. Bahour ’22 read the crowd an excerpt of the letter HOOP delivered Bacow, which referenced his September decision to move to divest the endowment from fossil fuels. In the letter, organizers demanded the University be “consistent both morally and logically” by divesting its endowment from corporations affiliated with Israeli settlements.
“For too long, the settler colonial state of Israel has occupied, subjugated, and oppressed Palestinians on their own land, denying them of their basic human rights and for too long Harvard University has profited off of this injustice,” the letter argues.
Organizers specifically criticized the Harvard endowment’s investments in companies including Motorola, which provided “virtual fences” that detect human movement used in some Israeli settlements; G4S, a security company that provided equipment to Israel’s military; and Caterpillar Inc., which manufactured bulldozers that have been used to destroy Palestinian homes.
“Our university’s endowment is tied to the ongoing dispossession of Palestinian people in the name of settler colonialism,” Bahour said.
Hiren K. Lemma ’24, a member of Ethnic Studies Coalition who attended the protest, said she believes Harvard students should stand as allies with campus divestment campaigns.
“It’s only our responsibility and the least we can do as non-Palestinians, as allies, as everyone here for the cause, to stand alongside them in danger and safety,” Lemma said.
The demonstration faced a disturbance. As protesters gathered outside of Massachusetts Hall, a group of onlookers hurled a filled bottle of water into the crowd and were then chased by protesters into the nearby MBTA station, although no one had been hurt.
HOOP organizer Christian B. Tabash ’21-’22 speculated the disturbance may have been caused by people against the causes of the protest.
“This is just a very obvious example of the sort of hostility that people who support Palestinian rights vocally face — that’s just the reality of it,” Tabash said.
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the rally or on HOOP’s criticisms of Harvard’s investments. Harvard University Police Department spokesperson Steven G. Catalano wrote in an email that the disturbance was not reported to the department.
In an interview following the rally, Tabash said the group will continue to pressure on Harvard to divest.
“We’ll keep making noise, we’ll keep disrupting things and the status quo, which is unjust,” Tabash said. “After the pandemic, we’re just now getting kick-started again, so a lot of planning and organizing is still in the works.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 16, 2021 at 6:00 p.m.
The Harvard Radcliffe Institute celebrated the work of Eileen Southern — the first African American woman tenured in Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences — in a webinar Monday.
The webinar, entitled “Black Women and the American University: Eileen Southern’s Story,” is a part of an initiative by the Department of Music and Harvard Library to honor Southern. The program is a “collaborative act of reparative justice” that aims to “explore the intersections of race, gender, and academic power in the experiences of one woman,” according to Carol J. Oja, director of the humanities program at Radcliffe and a Music professor.
Southern was a member of the Department of Music and Department of Afro-American Studies — now the African and African American Studies Department — and taught courses on Black music and Renaissance musical notation. Monday’s event featured the world premiere of “Light the Way Home: Eileen Southern’s Story,” a new short film that explores Southern’s life and professional challenges and is directed by undergraduates Uzo L. Ngwu ’23 and Daniel Huang ’22 and features music by Devon N. Gates ’23.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of Southern’s book “The Music of Black Americans: A History.” The book was first published in 1971 and provides one of the first comprehensive analyses of African American music, per Oja.
“‘The Music of Black Americans’ appeared in an era when Southern’s academic discipline — the field of musicology — had an overwhelming bias for white European music and was largely male,” Oja said. “Thus Southern wrote and taught from a subaltern position, as she confronted the academic climate of her day.”
Naomi André, a professor in the Afroamerican and African Studies and Women’s and Gender Studies departments at the University of Michigan, discussed why Southern declined to teach Black music courses in the Music department, opting to teach them in Afro-American Studies instead.
“It did not feel as though there was a space for Blackness in the Music department,“ André said, noting that she found no trace of Southern’s scholarship even though she came to Harvard for her Ph.D. shortly after Southern retired.
Tammy L. Kermodle, a Musicology professor at the Miami University of Ohio and a speaker in the event, said academic spaces may fail to acknowledge the struggles of Black women alongside their accomplishments — as was the case with Southern.
“Dr. Southern’s journey was not the journey that we know of and that we celebrate through her book, and all that she made for in terms of a foundation for this Black music historiography, but it was a journey that was also defined by stress, strain, pain, disappointment, and perhaps disillusionment,” she said.
André said she believes that Southern’s work has contributed to the overall understanding of American music, and that it sparked scholarship on the often overlooked contributions of Black women in American music studies.
“It is possible to take hits and also to thrive as a Black woman in music scholarship. Thinking about Eileen Southern helps me gain perspective,” André said. “We are planting seeds even if we do not see the full blossoming of their harvest in our own lifetimes.”
CORRECTION: November 16, 2021
A previous headline, caption, and version of this article misstated the sponsor of the initiative to honor Southern. It is sponsored by the Department of Music and Harvard Library.
It also misrepresented a quote from Carol J. Oja. Oja said that Southern’s work in the field of Black music studies came at a time when the field of musicology had an overwhelming bias for white European music and was largely male.

White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy spoke about looking at climate change activism as an opportunity for innovation rather than a barrier to growth at a virtual JFK Jr. Forum hosted by Harvard’s Institute of Politics on Monday.
Returning from the United Nations 2021 Climate Change Conference, McCarthy discussed her role in representing the United States' position on climate change at an international level, as well as the Biden administration’s approach to climate policy in its newly passed infrastructure bill and the role of “young people” in environmental advocacy.
McCarthy, chair of U.S. President Joe Biden’s National Climate Task Force, formerly headed the Environmental Protection Agency under former U.S. president Barack Obama and also served as a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, where she directed its Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment.
McCarthy said she believes the conference enabled the Biden administration to reaffirm its focus on “tackling” climate change.
“The greatest accomplishment, I think, was to make sure that the rest of the world knew that President Biden and his administration was fully committed to the challenge of climate change,” McCarthy said.
McCarthy also said she believes it is important to shift the narrative of climate activism from “a sacrifice” to a “hopeful path forward.”
“The country that races to achieve these goals will be the winner, not the loser,” she said. “It is an opportunity. It is how we’re going to grow economically. It is how we’re going to make the world healthier and preserve it for our future.”
McCarthy said the intersection of public health and climate change has played a role in her life since she attended grammar school across the street from a rubber company.
“Everyday they would manufacture rubber, and at certain points in time the smell would just knock you off your socks,” she said. “I do know pollution when I smell it, and it just never left me.”
McCarthy argued that the U.S. has an “outsized responsibility” to combat climate change domestically by lowering greenhouse gas emissions before “pointing fingers at other countries."
Turning to the recently passed $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, McCarthy said the administration was committed to using “every penny and every program” in the bill “with environmental justice in mind.”
For the last 10 minutes of the virtual event, former U.S. Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.), who also previously served as director of the IOP, joined the forum.
Sharp said he believes policies are “only part of the solution” to climate change, calling “non-government entities” — such as universities and climate activists — “incredible accelerators.”
McCarthy urged climate activists to be “impatient” and “vocal."

Fossil Fuel Divest Harvard activists published a report on Nov. 9 criticizing the University’s remaining links to fossil fuels within Harvard’s faculty, governing bodies, and research centers.
Among those listed in the report, student activists named the faculty and board members of the Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and the Harvard Corporation — the University's highest governing body.
Despite University President Lawrence S. Bacow’s September announcement that Harvard will effectively divest from the industry, FFDH activists are still interested in learning the extent to which fossil fuel companies have funded University research.
“Universities like Harvard are entangled with the industry in more ways than their endowments,” the report reads. “Even as they move to make their investments fossil free, they are allowing fossil fuel companies to fund research and programming, including around key issues of climate science and policy.”
FFDH activist and report co-author Suhaas M. Bhat ’24 joined other activists to investigate how fossil fuel money plays a role in academic research. They found that there were “millions upon millions of dollars” of fossil fuel funding all over Harvard’s schools.
In the report, FFDH activists alleged the Kennedy School of Government’s Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government and the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs — two centers focused on the study of environmental policy — are funded by oil money.
“The Belfer Center’s relationship to the fossil fuel industry has persisted since its founding, taking the forms of both program funding and faculty ties,” the report reads.
The report also claims the Harvard Electricity Policy Group — which is housed within the Mossavar-Rahmani Center — has lobbied states “to oppose expanded solar deployment” with funding from “Enel North America, Shell North America, Natural Gas Supply Association, FTI Consulting, and Charles River Associates.”
Beyond the Kennedy School, Divest Harvard also argued that members of the Harvard Corporation have profited from the fossil fuel industry.
Harvard Corporation members Paul J. Finnegan ’75 and David M. Rubenstein work for firms that have served clients in the fossil fuel industry, while Theodore V. “Ted” Wells Jr. was lead attorney for ExxonMobil for a suit brought by New York’s attorney general.
Wells has recused himself from Corporation deliberations related to fossil fuels since he agreed to represent ExxonMobil in 2015. Wells, Finnegan, and Rubenstein did not respond to requests for comment.
Outside the Corporation, the report stated that Harvard Law School professor Jody Freeman — the co-chair of the Harvard Presidential Committee on Sustainability and the director of the Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program — serves as a board member for natural gas conglomerate ConocoPhillips, per the company’s website.
Freeman did not respond to a request for comment.
Divest Harvard demanded the University to publicly disclose all funding and gifts related to research. It also called for Harvard to bar any future funding from fossil fuel companies for research on the environment, energy policy, or climate change.
Harvard Kennedy School student John J. Verghese, a co-author of the report, pointed to the Harvard School of Public Health’s policy against accepting funding from tobacco companies as precedent for the group’s demands.
“If you accept funding from someone, it is much harder to criticize the kinds of things they do, which is why the Chan School has a policy against accepting any kind of tobacco companies,” he said. “They have to draw the line in the sand and just say, ‘No, these are bad actors, and we won't take their money.’”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the report.
Divest Harvard joined with the Harvard Prison Divestment Campaign and Stop Harvard Land Grabs on Friday to reiterate the report’s demands. Student activists rallied across campus, moving from the Kennedy School to the Science Center before concluding at the Law School.
Phoebe G. Barr ’24, an organizer with Divest Harvard, said she believes the two activist groups should “invest in solidarity,” despite their different divestment goals.
“We want these campaigns to work more closely together because essentially, we’re all fighting for the same thing,” she said. “We’re fighting for a just endowment, a Harvard we can believe in, and a future that prioritizes people over profit.”

The anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions, which is suing Harvard and the University of North Carolina over their use of race-conscious admissions practices, asked the United States Supreme Court last week to hear both cases together.
SFFA is seeking to overturn rulings by lower courts that have upheld the use of race in the admissions processes at both schools. Merging the cases would allow SFFA’s lawsuit against UNC to advance to the high court alongside the case against Harvard, which the group already petitioned the Supreme Court to take up.
“We hope the Supreme Court will use the Harvard and UNC cases to begin the restoration of the colorblind legal covenant that holds together Americans of all races and ethnicities,” SFFA President Edward J. Blum said in a press release.
In its most recent petition, SFFA questioned the use of race as a factor in admissions processes, which was previously upheld by the 2003 Supreme Court case Grutter v. Bollinger.
The group argued that the suit against UNC is a “companion case” to the one filed against Harvard because they have “similar or identical issues of importance already pending before the Court.”
“SFFA is basically saying these cases go hand-in-hand,” said Vinay Harpalani, a law professor at the University of New Mexico.
Harpalani said the group is arguing that the cases complement each other because they both invoke Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.” He added that the UNC case also invokes the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment because it is a public institution.
Harvard spokesperson Rachael Dane declined to comment on SFFA’s petition.
SFFA asked the Supreme Court to hear its lawsuit against Harvard in February and the University submitted its opposition on May 17. In June, the Court delayed a decision on whether to hear the case, asking for input from the Biden administration.
The anti-affirmative action group first filed suit against Harvard in 2014, arguing that the University’s race-conscious admissions practices discriminate against Asian Americans and violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Harvard won the first trial in Massachusetts District Court in October 2019, and the result was upheld by an appellate court in November 2020.
UNC Chapel Hill law professor Theodore M. Shaw said SFFA’s goal is to “strike a death blow” to affirmative action in the U.S.
“This is the most conservative Supreme Court that we have seen, certainly during our lifetime,” Shaw said. “It could do a lot of damage to opportunity for Black and brown students to attend selective institutions of higher education.”
Harpalani said SFFA’s petition may allow the Supreme Court to hear the UNC case sooner. He added that the petition could make the court more inclined to grant a writ of certiorari.
“Even if they only heard the Harvard case — or denied cert on Harvard and later only heard the UNC case — chances are pretty good that they would overrule Grutter,” he said.

Harvard Management Company sold its holdings in several technology and pharmaceutical companies while increasing its investments in Facebook as its public securities portfolio fell by 2 percent to $1.71 billion in the third quarter of 2021.
HMC reported the figure in its latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The regulatory agency requires investment managers who oversee more than $100 million in assets to disclose public securities holdings each quarter.
The University’s stock portfolio, one of the only publicly available sources of information on HMC’s investments, accounts for 3 percent of Harvard’s endowment.
The University’s endowment spiked to $53.2 billion in the fiscal year ending in June 2021, posting 33.6 percent returns as its investments benefited from strong public and private equity markets.
In the third quarter, which ran from June 1 to Sept. 30, HMC sold off its stocks in the technology companies Palo Alto Network and Intercontinental Exchange. Over the same period, it also sold its holdings in DaVita Inc, a healthcare company owned by Berkshire Hathaway; Unity Software, a video game software development company; Pinduoduo Inc, one of China’s largest e-commerce platforms; NuCana, a biopharmaceutical company focusing on cancer treatments; and Cortexyme, a biopharmaceutical company focusing on treatments for degenerative diseases.
HMC also sold some of its shares in Apple, decreasing its holdings in the tech company from $333 million to $267 million. Apple was nonetheless the largest single holding reported in the filing.
HMC increased its shares in Facebook by 37 percent, to a current value of around $242 million. The filing describes investments made in the third quarter, which predated the Facebook company's October announcement that it would rebrand as Meta Platforms.
The University also expanded its portfolio by purchasing shares in biotechnology companies Pacific Biosciences of California and Sana Biotechnologies, and financial technology company Affirm Holdings. The total value of these holdings stand at $5.9 million, $26.2 million, and $89.8 million, respectively.
In its largest acquisition of the quarter, HMC purchased 61,070 shares totalling $163 million in Alphabet, Google’s parent company.
John M. Longo, a professor at Rutgers Business School and the Chief Investment Officer for the Beacon Trust, wrote in an email that the changes in investments do not reflect major changes to the course of the endowment’s investment strategy.
Consistent with past quarters, the majority of companies HMC has public securities in are in the technology, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical sectors.
“The changes made by Harvard Management Company (HMC) appear to be incremental in nature rather than a significant change in asset allocation or industry exposure,” Longo wrote.
He added that the acquisition of Facebook and Alphabet shares indicate HMC’s confidence in the two technology companies.
“They also appear to have a lot of confidence in Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, since they added to its position when it was already among their largest equity holdings,” Longo wrote. “The new position in Alphabet also indicates a high level of confidence since it is among their top 5 equity holdings.”
Patrick S. McKiernan, a spokesperson for HMC, declined to comment on the filings, citing the endowment’s policy not to comment on individual investments.

UPDATED: November 16, 2021 at 1:13 a.m.
Four women of color will helm the Institute of Politics for the first time in its 55-year history, the organization announced Monday.
President-elect Janna E. Ramadan ’23, who will be the first Palestinian-American to serve in the role, said the election marks a shift in the diversity of the IOP’s leadership.
“I came in freshman year and only saw one person of color in leadership and met them within the first couple opening days of events,” Ramadan said. “Now, our four executive members of the executive board are all women of color.”
Ramadan — who is also a Crimson blog editor — will be joined by incoming vice president Tabitha L. Escalante ’23, treasurer Stephanie Lin ’24, and communications director Amen H. Gashaw ’24.
Escalante said she believes the diverse leadership ranks show the organization's “changing priorities.”
“I think it’s also a demonstration of the institution’s changing priorities,” Escalante said. “We’re glad that the Institute is ready to uplift a wholly women of color board — that’s incredible.”
Ramadan said she believes her identity will help expand topics of conversation at the IOP.
“Honestly, for me, it means that I can imagine an IOP that talks about conversations that maybe the general political discourse is not open to,” Ramadan said.
“Just by nature of me being completely and fully open about my identity, we have now opened the door to conversations about disputed territories and conflicts that are happening in the world that maybe tend to be more avoided in terms of political topics and conversations,” she added.
Outgoing president Menatallah N. “Menat” Bahnasy ’22 said the incoming executive board reflects efforts made in recent years to make the IOP a more inclusive space.
“We’ve made lots of strides over the years in terms of really making it an inclusive space for anyone and everyone, and so to see our highest student leadership be women of color is truly indicative of the work that’s been put in to make the IOP a more inclusive space,” Bahnasy said.
Outgoing vice president Kevin L. Ballen ’22 said the new administration will work toward ensuring students can bring their “full identities” to the IOP.
“I think that's really central to everything — whether it be ideology, whether it be race, whether it be socioeconomic status, whether it be class year, where you're from — I think that's going to be built at the center of what they're doing and sort of making this a really homelike and inclusive space,” Ballen said.
Escalante said she believes the IOP does not just cultivate leaders who are “future senators, future representatives, future Pete Buttigiegs,” but also those interested in being leaders beyond politics.
“We’re really here to make sure that everybody who comes in feels like they have a touch point to do what they want to do in the future and be at the top of their field and connect with the people that have come before them,” Escalante said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Undergraduate Council passed legislation removing its constitution’s requirement to register as a non-profit and reallocating previously-assigned funds during a tense three-hour meeting Sunday that came just one day after the conclusion of a contentious UC presidential election.
Tensions on the council boiled over during the meeting, as members debated constitutional amendments, bylaw suspensions, and budget changes. One member left in tears and another took over a microphone to denounce the organization’s culture.
“This is the first meeting following the outcome of a really contentious election,” UC Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 said in an interview after the meeting Sunday. “So you might imagine that that might be reflected in how people talk to each other, interact, less than 24 hours after the results were announced.”
During the first portion of the meeting, the body changed its constitution to strike Section 12 from Article 1, which required the body to register as a non-profit organization and to dissolve itself and redistribute its funding should it fail to do so. The UC also passed legislation reallocating previously-assigned funds, which drew backlash from some members of the body who said the move was unconstitutional.
The constitutional amendment came following allegations by a UC presidential ticket, which ultimately lost, that the organization committed tax fraud by failing to register as a non-profit.
“The UC has continued to operate and function since 2012 despite not filing as a nonprofit,” the legislation reads.
Later in the meeting, the body suspended its bylaws to re-allocate funds to provide annual grant funding to the Phillips Brooks House Association. Some UC members — including the body’s parliamentarian — said the act violated the council’s constitution by reallocating money that was previously assigned to a committee without obtaining the sub-group’s consent to do so.
UC parliamentarian Samuel H. Taylor ’24 said the act violated Section 2 of Article IV of the UC Constitution, which states that “in cases where legislation calls for the allocation of funding from a non-docketing committee’s budget, that committee must approve that legislation for docketing by way of a successful vote of endorsement.”
“There’s no wiggle room there,” Taylor said of the provision Monday. “Usually there is, but that is not a vaguely-written provision. That’s a really clear provision.”
UC Pesident Noah A. Harris ’22 and Vice President Jenny Y. Gan ’22 pushed back against claims that the legislation was unconstitutional.
“The amendment to the budget was constitutional,” Harris and Gan wrote in a statement Monday. “Originally, the constitutional question was if the Treasurer could re-allocate money from the Finance Committee to PBHA. However, the legislation was instead submitted as a budget amendment, which the Treasurer is able to do.”
The legislation allocates $15,000 from the UC Burst Pack — a source of funds any UC committee can draw from — and $10,000 from the body’s finance committee toward a $25,000 block grant for PBHA. The legislation passed 17-11 with four abstentions.
UC Secretary Nicholas J. Brennan ’23, who voted against the act, argued the legislation is unconstitutional.
“They’ve kind of become like the piggy bank that everybody on the Council targets for money,” Brennan said of the finance committee. “I think that this is just another continuation of that.”
UC Treasurer Kimani E. Panthier ’24, who introduced the legislation Sunday, wrote in a statement that he proposed the act following “numerous meetings with PBHA leadership” during which the organization requested grant funds from the UC.
“As the Treasurer, it is within my constitutional ability to propose and/or amend a budget,” Panthier wrote Monday. “After consultation with the President, Vice President, Rules Chair (who is also the former Treasurer), I decided this was the best course of action.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Hours before its second strike deadline this fall, Harvard's graduate student union reached a tentative agreement with the University for a four-year contract Monday evening. The union then approved two votes: an imminent vote on whether to continue the strike and a ratification vote on the tentative contract agreement that will open Thursday.
Regardless of the tentative agreement, the union’s second strike in a month officially began at midnight. The Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers bargaining committee recommended, however, that student workers not withhold their labor on Tuesday as the 24-hour vote proceeds.
The bargaining committee — which unanimously approved the tentative agreement and unanimously favors ending the strike — also canceled pickets and a rally scheduled for Tuesday.
In the tentative agreement, the union conceded on two of its three key demands — non-discrimination procedures and union security — but won major gains in compensation.
“We are recommending this contract to you for ratification with the clear recognition that this contract does not include everything that was important to us,” the bargaining committee wrote in an union-wide announcement Monday night. “In order to secure some of the rights and benefits above, we had to make difficult concessions with the hope that future [bargaining committees] will be able to carry forward these fights.”
The sudden announcement of the tentative agreement came during a previously-scheduled special membership meeting. After several hours of bargaining with Harvard and internal discussion Monday, the bargaining committee unanimously approved the tentative agreement with the University.
At the membership meeting, Cory W. McCartan, a member of the HGSU-UAW bargaining committee, motioned to vote to end the strike. Meeting attendees then agreed to the motion, putting the question to a 24-hour online membership-wide vote starting Tuesday on whether or not to end the strike. Only a majority of votes is required to end the strike.
Ending this strike does not preclude the bargaining committee from calling additional strikes before Dec. 31.
The vote to end the strike is separate from the vote to ratify the tentative agreement and secure a contract. The ratification vote for the tentative agreement will close on Saturday, Nov. 27.
The tentative agreement covers four years, one year longer than the union originally pushed for. If ratified, the tentative agreement will solidify significant increases in wages and benefits, but it does not include third-party majorities on Title IX hearing and appellate panels or agency shop.
The tentative agreement includes a 5 percent salary increase in the first year of the contract, retroactive to July 1. The second, third, and fourth years of the contract include 4 percent, 3 percent, and 3 percent raises, respectively.
The percentage raises in the tentative agreement are closer to the union’s demands for 5.5 percent, 4.25 percent, and 3 percent raises in a three-year contract, and significantly higher than Harvard’s initial offer over the summer of zero percent raises and a flat bonuses in the first year of the contract, followed by 2.5 percent annual raises.
In a victory for the union, student workers who pursue complaints of non-Title IX discrimination and harassment can appeal their cases to arbitration by a third-party, though they will still initially have to go through Harvard’s processes.
The tentative agreement, however, does not include most of the key provisions the union sought around non-discrimination procedures. HGSU-UAW did not secure third-party arbitration for non-Title IX cases at the initial claims stage.
As for Title IX claims, the union also conceded on its demand that Title IX hearing and appellate panels be composed of a majority of independent members. Student workers pursuing Title IX claims will have to go through Harvard’s internal hearing and appeals processes, after which the union can take cases to mediation.
The union will also now have access to a $400,000 legal expense fund for student workers pursuing Title IX cases over the four-year contract, but the fund is $200,000 less than what the union advocated for.
The tentative agreement also does not include the union’s demand for agency shop, which would require all bargaining unit members to contribute in some way to union activities or a student worker health fund. Under the tentative agreement reached Monday, student workers would have to explicitly state whether or not they will join the union within 30 days of receiving their employment appointment letter, but those who do not join will face no fees.
In an email to faculty Monday evening, Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 wrote that both parties had reached an agreement and that the University would share more details about ratification in the coming days.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The sun came out on Saturday at Harvard Stadium, setting a beautiful backdrop for the Harvard’s Senior Day festivities. Just before the 12:05 p.m. kickoff, the school recognized its supersized class of seniors, composed of social seniors playing their third season of football eligibility and members of the Class of 2021 who were granted an extra year after losing their senior seasons due to the Covid-19 pandemic. After kickoff, the celebration continued, as the Crimson (7-2, 4-2 Ivy) pushed through an early challenge from Penn (3-6, 1-5) to emerge with a 23-7 victory. The score line belied how competitive the game was, as the Quakers earned more first downs, had more passing yards, and possessed the ball for nearly as long as Harvard. The Crimson defense stepped up in clutch situations, winning the turnover battle 4-0 to help earn the win.
Hoping to catch Harvard off guard, Penn head coach Ray Priore opted for a trick play on its first snap of the game. After the Crimson managed to pull off two flea flickers for 87 yards in its 49-21 victory over Columbia on Nov. 6, the Quakers hoped to recreate Harvard’s success. Wide receiver Joshua Casilli got open on the left side near midfield, but quarterback Aidan Sayin’s pass bounced off his hands and straight into the waiting arms of junior safety James Herring. Herring’s first career interception left the Crimson with good field position at its own 47-yard line just fourteen seconds into the game. The play also set the tone for the aggression that both teams would show throughout the contest.
Harvard stuck to its standard offense in the victory, pairing handoffs to junior running back Aaron Shampklin and sophomore running back Aidan Borguet with screen passes to senior wide receiver B.J. Watson and the occasional deep shot. Meanwhile, Penn introduced a triple-option look that the Crimson has not faced yet this season, pairing their wildcat quarterback, defensive back Maurcus McDaniel, with three running backs in the backfield. This look allowed the Quakers to score its first touchdown of the game in the second quarter, as Isaiah Malcome took a run down the right sideline and beat every Harvard defender to the pylon for a 20-yard score, cutting the Harvard lead at the time to 10-7.
“They come out and run triple options,” head coach Tim Murphy said. “I don’t know how many hours they practice, but to be able to have a pro-style spread attack and then come out and run the triple option … it was impressive, but [defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ‘99] and our staff made the adjustments to get that under control and didn’t give them very much incentive to run it very much in the second half.”
The game was gritty and hard-fought, and competitive throughout. Sayin was able to move the ball for much of the game, thanks to wide receiver Rory Starkey Jr., who had missed the previous two games with a high-ankle sprain. Starkey finished with seven catches for 62 yards to lead the team, and overall, Sayin completed 20 of his 36 passes for 207 yards, showing the flashes of talent that caused Priore to make the switch from senior John Quinnelly earlier in the season.
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson had opportunities to jump out to leads, but failed to convert inside the red zone. Prior to the game, Harvard had come away with a touchdown on 21 of its previous 37 drives inside the opponent’s 20, but the 15th-ranked Quakers red zone defense held it to just one on five tries. Instead, junior kicker Jonah Lipel was forced to attempt four field goals, and Penn’s special teams unit managed to block one, a 31-yard try near the end of the third quarter that would have extended the Crimson lead to 19-7.
In addition, Harvard, which entered the game as the 18th-most disciplined team in the country, being flagged just five times per contest, committed nine penalties for 90 yards. Some of these came in critical situations and kept Quaker drives alive. One early pass interference called against senior linebacker Jordan Hill negated an interception by sophomore safety Victor Tademy in the first quarter. Then, on the Penn touchdown drive, Herring was flagged for a late hit, which moved the offense forward. Finally, an offsides call overturned what would have been an interception returned back to the five-yard line by sophomore cornerback Khalil Dawsey at the end of the third quarter. After the game, Murphy vowed that the Crimson would do better next weekend against Yale.
“It’s concerning, for sure, especially because, quite frankly, we talked about that. We talked about how critical it is to be smart and be disciplined,” he said. “It’s a very fine line for our kids to play really, really hard, as you have to play on defense, as one example, and at the same time, not be able to do something that’s going to cost your team. So, we have room for improvement, starting with me … That certainly will be a focal point preparing for Yale. We can’t give them anything, and that certainly means don’t let them extend plays because of penalties.
Throughout the game, the Quakers defense mostly bottled up Harvard’s high-powered run game. Entering the game as the Ivy League’s leading rusher with 94.1 yards per game, Shampklin had multiple runs that went for losses, including one in which he was bottled up 11 yards behind the line of scrimmage. However, he broke three long ones when it counted, the most important of which being a 72-yard gain straight up the middle of Soldiers Field for his tenth rushing touchdown of the season. The play, which occurred on 3rd and 16 immediately after Adam Coyner and Jake Heimlicher got through for a sack, gave the Crimson some much-needed momentum where it looked like the drive had stalled.
“It wasn’t all me. The juice really came because the [offensive line] blocked it up perfectly,” Shampklin explained. “So they were more excited, as well, just to see that. We did what we were supposed to on the play, and the result that happened was [me] having the ball. So it didn’t really matter whether [it was] first down, second down, third down. As an offense, we collectively scored on that play. It wasn’t just me, so we were all just juiced because of that.”
He did it again on the last drive of the game, with the outcome still hanging in the balance more than halfway through the fourth quarter, as Harvard hung on to a nine-point lead. Facing 3rd and 10 on Penn’s 41-yard line, he took a handoff down the left sideline for a 16-yard game to keep the clock moving and effectively ice the game. Three plays later, on the last home handoff of his illustrious Crimson career, he found a hole through the middle of the field for a 16-yard score, his fifth two-touchdown game of the season. With just two minutes, 32 seconds remaining, the Quakers’ prospects of a comeback were all but dashed, and Herring’s second interception a few minutes later was a mere formality.
Shampklin’s run put the finishing touches on a solid second half on both ends of the ball for Harvard, which had been much better before the break than after it entering the game. In its first eight games, the Crimson outscored its opponents 187-35 (+152) in the first two quarters but only 100-76 (+24) after halftime. After losing the second half in the Columbia matchup, Hill, the 147th captain of Harvard football, insisted that the team needed to finish games better. The Crimson won the first half 13-7 before tacking on another ten unanswered points in the second half.
“As a defense, we have a lot of pride in our program, and I would say that it’s expected of us to finish the game strong and to win out,” junior defensive lineman Jacob Sykes said. “By us winning the second half, it really just showed our true character. … We’re happy for this, but it’s not anything that’s out of the ordinary for the defense.”
It was the third second-half shutout that defensive coordinator Scott Larkee ‘99’s unit has pitched this season, but it might not have been possible without the contributions of junior linebacker Daniel Abraham, who played running back the last time these two teams matched up on Nov. 16, 2019 before making the switch to the other side of the ball. He showed why he made that move on Penn’s third drive of the second half. With the Quakers driving into Harvard territory after wide receiver Julien Stokes hauled in a 27-yard reception, Abraham jumped the curl route and snatched the ball away from the receiver for his second interception of the season. Penn looked as if they were building some momentum, but after Abraham’s pick quelled its most promising possession of the half, it never seriously threatened the end zone again. In fact, it would not reach Harvard territory again until Casilli came down with a 36-yard catch with the game already decided.
Senior linebacker Andrew Irwin, who turned 23 on Wednesday, delivered his team a belated birthday gift by forcing a strip sack on Sayin near the start of the third quarter. Although the freshman appeared to be in his passing motion when Irwin knocked the ball loose, officials decided not to review the play. Junior defensive lineman Truman Jones pounced on the ball, giving his team possession at the Quakers’ 20-yard line. Although Penn’s defense was able to produce a stop, Lipel hammered a 41-yard field goal home to extend the Crimson’s lead to 16-7.
The win, which was the first for the home team at Harvard Stadium since 2013, marked a positive send-off for two classes of Harvard players. The next time the team takes the field at Harvard Stadium, its roster will look much different. In addition to the eighteen seniors who were playing out their final year of football eligibility despite graduating in 2021, the Class of 2022 includes several junior playmakers who will not be able to play next fall. Chief among them is Shampklin, who, earlier this season, became the eighth player to reach 2,000 rushing yards in a Crimson uniform despite playing just three seasons. Emge, who completed 13 of his 28 passes for 167 yards in the victory, was also honored before the game, as was Wimberly, who caught seven passes for 111 yards to become Harvard’s first 100-yard receiver of the season on Nov. 6 at Columbia.
“It was kind of surreal. Time really flies. I didn’t realize how quick time moves sometimes,” Shampklin said. “For it to be my last game at Harvard Stadium is kind of bittersweet, but at the same time, it made me enjoy it a little more. I was able to sit back and watch and appreciate playing at Harvard Stadium. It’s really a blessing for me to be able to play here. For me, it was just a very surreal moment and I just wanted to take it all in, and I feel like I did that today.”
Although the Crimson stand to lose many of its most impactful playmakers, it should still be able to content for a conference championship in 2022, with sophomore quarterback Charlie Dean, who started four of the first five games of the season, set to return from his season-ending injury, and Borguet, who was the Ivy League’s Rookie of the Year in 2019 after capping off the season with a 269-yard, four touchdown performance at the Yale Bowl. Their efforts will be buoyed by the resilient players that Harvard seeks to recruit every year.
“The biggest thing we always talk about is the character piece, and the character piece involves facing adversity,” Murphy said. “That’s the focal point. We get unbelievably high-character kids, not just in terms of being great kids who are going to make Harvard proud, but kids who are tough and resilient. A lot of them come from very challenging backgrounds where they’ve had to be that, to fight their way up in the world to get into Harvard. But we have the best kids in the Ivy League. You can’t quantify that, but that’s what we have.”
With the win, the Crimson are still in the race for a share of the Ivy League title, but after only one of three results went its way on Saturday, it will require a lot of help. It needs to win its final game, and for Princeton and Dartmouth to each lose its season finale. The Tigers defeated Yale, 35-20, on Saturday afternoon in Princeton, N.J., and the Big Green blew out Cornell, 41-7, in Hanover, N.H., setting up the stakes for the final week of the season. However, despite the championship implications riding on the 137th Playing of The Game, Harvard players are focused solely on beating the Bulldogs on their home turf.
“The next game is our best game,” junior defensive lineman Chris Smith said. “That’s just going to be our mentality this week. We’ve still got to practice hard. We’ve still got to finish. As a defense, as a team, just not being complacent. We’re on a two-game winning streak, but we really want to close the season out strong and show how hard we’ve worked this season and the adversity we’ve overcome.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard put on a show for its home fans on senior day, cruising to a 4-1 victory over Penn to secure its first winning Ivy League season since 2016.
Harvard (8-5-3, 3-2-2 Ivy) honored eight seniors with a pre-match ceremony, all of whom notched minutes on the afternoon. Penn (7-6-3, 1-4-2 Ivy) tried to play spoiler in the game and initially boasted a loud contingent of fans, but the Quakers were quickly quieted by the events of the game.
“It feels incredible to share it with 29 guys who I can call my brothers,” said captain Ferrnando Docters of the senior day celebrations. “It’s been a heck of a season — much improved since 2019 — and I'm really looking forward to the future these guys have.”
The Crimson entered the game as the second-best offense in the Ivy League, second in goals (1.71) and assists (2.20) per game, with its young defense not always able to match the high standard set by the offense.
Harvard opened the scoring early, with junior forward Martin Vician getting on the end of a cross from senior midfielder Cornelius Bencsik in the sixth minute. The goal marked Vician’s third straight game with a goal, and his seventh goal of the season.
The Crimson doubled its lead in the 14th minute, with first-year forward Alessandro Arlotti grabbing his team-best ninth goal of the season. Arlotti was found at the back post by sophomore midfielder Willem Ebbinge, whose looping left-footed cross was finished after being taken down by the forward at the far post. The assist was Ebbinge’s 10th on the year, who finishes the season fourth in the NCAA in assists per game with 0.67.
Early on in the second half, Vician gave the home fans a treat with a spectacular volley which put Harvard up 3-0. In the 48th minute, first-year defender Ludovico Rollo launched a long ball from his own half towards Vician, who volleyed the ball with his first touch out of the air, with the ensuing shot flying into the top corner, for his second of the game and eighth of the season.
“I don’t think I’ve scored a better goal than that in my life,” Vician said of the strike. “It was really once in a lifetime. I just saw a nice ball from Ludo, I ran in behind and tried to finish it one time. I’m just happy the goal helped the team and that we won. It was an amazing last game for the seniors.”
Junior goalkeeper Oskar Nilsson was busy on the night, maintaining a shutout for 87 minutes on a series of good saves, but the Quakers were eventually able to get a consolation goal. In the 88th minute, Nilsson faced a shot in a crowded box following a corner, and saved in traffic, but the rebound was tapped in for 3-1.
Just over a minute later, the Crimson hit back, moving the ball wide to senior midfielder Nico Garcia-Morillo on the counter, who crossed to fellow senior midfielder Alex Debayo-Doherty, who finished at the back post with 18 seconds to play. The goal was the final touch of his collegiate career, which returned Harvard’s three-goal lead, ending the game at 4-1.
“The support really does mean a lot to us,” said Docters of the home fans’ impact. “It’s almost like having an extra guy out there on the field with us.”
The all-time series now stands 39-37-5 in the Crimson’s favor following the win. The win cemented Harvard’s fourth place finish in the Ivy League at 3-2-2, its first winning Ivy League season since 2016. The Crimson will return eight of eleven starters next season, including its top-three point earners in Arlotti, Vician, and Ebbinge.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 2016 ended on Sunday afternoon in Winston-Salem, N.C., as Wake Forest neutralized the Crimson’s attack en route to a comfortable 3-0 win. The Demon Deacons (16-5-0, 7-5-0 ACC) played an almost mistake-free game, continuing their fine play after an excellent showing in the ACC Tournament as they held Harvard (12-3-1, 5-2-0 Ivy League) to just six shots, easily a season-low. The Crimson gave up three goals for only the second time in a game that was closer than the final score indicates.
Harvard entered the game with the better RPI, but it was clear from the start that the battle-tested ACC defense of Wake Forest would be difficult to break down. The Crimson had few glimpses at goal. Its only first-half shot came after first-year midfielder Hannah Bebar stole the ball and then had a shot saved by sophomore goalie Kaitlyn Parks, who registered her ninth shutout of the season. That turnover was one of only a few the Demon Deacons committed in their half all game. Harvard’s press was less effective than it had been during the regular season in a game in which the Crimson was out of possession far more than it is used to.
“We’ve had the majority of possession and more shots and chances than any team we’ve played this year, so this was a really big test for us,” head coach Chris Hamblin said. “And they’re a really good team. They [Wake Forest] have been playing a lot of good soccer toward the end of the season, and I think they’re going to be a tough out in the rest of this NCAA Tournament.”
Wake Forest also had its fair share of trouble breaking down the Crimson’s defense and managed just eight shots. But the Demon Deacons offered enough going forward to push a few goals past goalies Hannah Gardner (in the first half) and Anna Karpenko (in the second). Their first tally came on a left-footed strike by midfielder Sofia Rossi, who calmly received a pass from Shayla Smart and, from the top of the box, lofted a left-footed shot into the far corner for her ninth goal of the season to put Wake Forest ahead 12 minutes into the game.
Wake Forest then dealt a fatal blow to Harvard’s chances early in the second half, when it scored two goals in quick succession just as the Crimson was growing into the game. First, a tremendous through ball found forward Hulda Arnarsdottir, who buried a one-time finish to give the Demon Deacons an insurance goal. Two minutes later, a foul near the corner flag gave Wake Forest a dangerous free kick, which found the head of Smart and then the back of the net to put the game out of reach.
Harvard had its best patterns of play down the right flank, where first-year right back Taylor Fasnacht caused the Demon Deacons some problems. Fasnacht had the best chance to get on the scoresheet, finding space in the box and firing a shot that may have nestled inside the near post had Parks not gotten a strong hand to the ball to send it wide. But while the Crimson found more space on the counter attack early in the second half, the air was taken out of its sails by the one-two Wake Forest punch in the 58th and 61st minutes.
“That was really hard,” Hamblin said. “I think we had the momentum and had the possession and were getting at Wake a little bit right before they scored that second goal, so for them to take advantage of that and then the set-piece goal right after was a difficult pill to swallow. But what an experience for our players to be able to see how this tournament works out.”
Senior forward Murphy Agnew, the fulcrum of Harvard’s attack two years ago, returned to make her NCAA Tournament debut after missing the entire Ivy League season due to injury but was pulled after just 11 minutes and left with a noticeable limp. Without Agnew, the Crimson struggled to find an offensive spark, just as it had against Brown and Princeton. The midfield did not provide much support for junior forward Angela Caloia, who cut a lonely figure up top for most of the game as Harvard fought to establish possession in Wake Forest’s half.
It was a difficult end to a promising season for the Crimson, which will take solace in the fact that it fought through a number of injuries and will return most of its young core next season. The arrow is firmly pointed up for Harvard and for the Ivy League, which sent three teams to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2004. The conference’s hopes now rest with Princeton, which defeated Vermont in the first round and will play TCU on Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard men’s water polo co-captain Noah Hodge said that “defense wins championships is our team’s motto.”
Harvard stayed true to that motto in its final three games of the 2021 regular season. No. 12 Harvard concluded its regular-season campaign with three consecutive victories on Nov. 6-7, ending the year with 25 wins. The Crimson (25-4, 9-2 NWPC) began with comfortable 16-13 and 17-8 victories over cross-town rival MIT (8-16, 2-9) and Connecticut College (1-13), respectively. The squad then ended the weekend with a quality 17-11 road win over No. 20 Brown (18-13, 5-4) to leap to No. 12 in the Collegiate Water Polo Association rankings.
“We did a very good job taking away what their strengths are,” said Harvard coach Ted Minnis when asked about what made the difference in the Brown contest. “We were able to move around the ball which made the defense work and put them in bad positions.”
The team travelled across town for its first challenge, against MIT. Harvard got out to an early 7-3 lead after the first quarter, thanks to two goals apiece from sophomore forwards Owen Hale and Mot Stothart.
The duo continued its attack, netting four goals each in the match to lead the Crimson to victory. Junior forward Michael Sonsini dished out five assists, and Hodge added nine saves during Harvard’s victory. With its victory, Harvard swept the season series against MIT.
The team found further success when it returned to Blodgett Pool for its final home game of the season against Connecticut College.
Once again, Harvard struck early with senior forward Michael Del Mundo tallying the first three scores of the game to help lead Harvard to an early 4-2 lead.
“I’m so happy for Del on getting that hat trick,” Minnis said. “He was the difference maker in that game.”
The statistics support the coach’s assessment. Del Mundo ended the contest with a game-high six goals to conclude potentially his final game at Blodgett Pool. Junior goalie Nathan Wu added a staggering 18 saves to solidify the Crimson’s defense.
Finally, the team traveled to Providence to meet nationally-ranked Brown. Despite the squad committing plenty of penalties to give the Bears power-play opportunities, Harvard again built an early lead against its Ivy League rival. Junior forward Gabe Putnam opened the scoring for the Crimson in the first period. In total, six different players scored in the first period, with sophomore forward Kaleb Archer netting the final point for the team in the first frame to give the Crimson a 6-2 lead.
“Our man-down defense has been a huge point of emphasis this entire year,” Hodge said. “Communicating effectively has definitely been a huge part of why we are so successful on defense — we’re all on the same page.”
Hodge led the way defensively in the contest, contributing 12 saves and an assist. The team vigorously pushed the pace in transition all game which began to wear down the Bears. Thanks to this game plan, and its strong defensive performance, Harvard never relinquished its early lead. Putnam, Archer, Sonsini, and junior co-captain Alex Tsotadze rounded out a balanced offensive effort, with each netting a hat trick in the 17-11 victory.
With the latest victory over Brown, Harvard swept the season series against the Bears. It marked the fifth consecutive win for the Crimson and the fourth time in program history that the team reached 25 regular season wins.
Harvard will face Connecticut College in the first round of the Northeast Water Polo Conference playoffs on Nov. 19 in Princeton, N.J.

College is hard! We’re not just talking about that midterm you barely passed, but the balancing act of academics, social life, and self-care. With the whirlwind of extracurriculars, classes, and new faces you deal with everyday, it’s easy to get overwhelmed at times. Especially to the introverts, we see you! In addition to carving pumpkins this fall, here’s Flyby’s guide to carving out time for yourself.
Making self-care a task 
Yes, we know that scheduling in time for yourself on your g-cal may feel a bit cliche, but you know what, sometimes you just have to do it. That little hour blocked out on your Wednesday afternoon may seem small and irrelevant in comparison to all of the other actually important things you have to do, but it’s also a great way to actually take some time for yourself. Practice some meditation, go to the gym, or perhaps take a nice walk while looking for Remy.
Riding around on the shuttle
Sometimes all you really need is the rocking motion of a shuttle bus to feel a little more at peace. Listen to some music, wistfully look out the window, and convince yourself this actually is productive because you really couldn't walk from the Yard to Mather and instead needed to add an extra 30 minutes to your commute/break.
Normalize eating alone…
… but still pull out your laptop to be ~productive~
In all seriousness, it’s okay to eat alone, no matter how weird it may feel. Contrary to popular belief, no one cares that you’re eating alone. Honestly.
Saying no to friends and no to FOMO
Sometimes saying no to friends is so hard because you get hit with that major FOMO. But when you’re sitting alone in your dorm while listening to laughter across the hall, just remember that you aren’t antisocial just because your *social battery is dead*. Anyway, who needs human company when you have a plethora of TV shows to catch up on? Which brings us to our next point...
Curling up on your bed with a selection of comfort shows
The Office, How I Met Your Mother, Gilmore Girls… Everyone has their favorite, sometimes basic, comfort show and watching it for the 10th time is a great way to take some time for yourself and decompress. Fluff up your pillows, turn on some mood lighting and settle in for two to seven episodes. (You are obviously not procrastinating, you are just practicing self-care.)
Sleeping until 3 p.m.
Everyone has those days where they just need to sleep for the next 14 hours and make up for the consecutive nights of getting three hours of sleep. Alone time can also mean sleep time, so pick a day (preferably on a weekend so you don’t skip class) to sleep to your heart’s content. PSA for the people living with roommates: remember to turn off your morning alarm the night before so you don’t wake your roommate up at 7 a.m. when you definitely aren’t going to wake up.
So, to all you burnt-out college students, let this be a sign to take a break. As much as finishing that pset or going to that social gathering seems like the most important thing, evaluate your priorities and appreciate those precious moments of alone time. The semester’s almost over, so what better time to reconnect with yourself before the nightmare of finals?
