After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For this year’s annual First-Year Musical, the Class of 2020 showcases “Ammunition: The Musical,” an original show about women working in munitions factories during World War II. The women experience newfound independence and empowerment, but when the war is over and the men return from combat, the women who want to continue working must grapple with pay inequality and the loss of much of the recognition and freedom they had enjoyed. This musical seeks to be more serious and relevant to social issues than previous First-Year Musicals, which have usually been known for their lighthearted tone. The writers chose to focus on contemporary issues of female empowerment through the lens of a musical set in the forties.
Much of the story revolves around the relationships and tensions between the women working at home and the men returning from combat. Natalie, played by Rory K. Wakeford ’20, is a confident, well-respected welder who leads the movement for pay equality when the war is over. Bobby Malley ’20 plays Wallace, a male worker who stayed behind during the war because of a purported injury. “He’s kind of a jerk,” Malley says. “He butts heads with Natalie over her activism. They’re also friends, and it’s complicated. He provides an unusual male perspective on this period in history.”
“Ammunition” is written, composed, directed, produced, and acted in entirely by freshmen who were selected by last year’s First-Year Musical team. The cast and crew includes both students active in theater as well as others with little to no prior experience. The musical provides a perfect entryway into the theater community at Harvard, but it is also certainly a daunting task for the cast and crew. “It’s a challenge. It’s a welcome one, and it’s an amazing one,” says director Eli Troen ’20. “With the cast having to learn maybe 15 songs that were only written three to four weeks ago, and working with line changes and things like that—that’s a lot of stress, and it’s not easy, and I think that has allowed us to have this mutual struggle we’re bonding over, and create a really tight-knit community.”
“Ammunition: The Musical” will be in Agassiz Theater from April 23 to April 30.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The decision by the Harvard University administration to treat its students like baseless infants by placing undue pressures on them to not be members of single-sex organizations illustrates the administration’s belief that Harvard’s students are unfit or unable to make choices on their own. As Harvard students, you should demand better from your administration.
For well more than 200 years, fraternal organizations have provided learning and leadership opportunities to college students in a positive environment which produces results and builds better citizens and leaders. In the 2014-15 academic year, for example, the more than 380,000 undergraduate fraternity men raised more than $20 million for philanthropic purposes and performed nearly four million hours of community service.  Similar fraternal organizations at Harvard have met with analogous results.
Alpha Epsilon Pi came to Harvard in 2001 to provide a unique fraternal experience to Harvard undergraduates. As a fraternity with a distinctly Jewish mission—to develop the future leaders of the Jewish community―we believed strongly that Harvard undergraduate students would help us fulfill that mission. We’re immensely proud of our Harvard chapter alumni who have gone on to accomplish many great things in the Jewish community as well as in their professional fields of technology, business, law, and medicine.
AEPi operates on nearly 190 campuses in the United States, Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom, Austria, and Australia. Nearly 10,000 undergraduates are currently members of our fraternity along with more than 90,000 living alumni.
AEPi―like the other members of the North-American Interfraternity Conference―is a single-sex organization. But, contrary to the Harvard administration’s belief, that doesn’t mean that our organization or our members cannot provide positive experiences for Harvard students. When the administration changed course last month and agreed to allow all-female organizations but not all-male groups, the true issues became even more apparent.
Harvard administrators have created a policy that assumes that male groups are, by their nature, dangerous. That’s an incredibly disturbing point of view and one which every student and alum should sharply criticize. This policy has never been about fairness or inclusiveness. This is simply about “shaming” members of all-male organizations. Perhaps the University is reacting to concerns about behavioral issues or bending to politically correct pressures to vilify all-male student groups. As students of Harvard University, you should be outraged at the infantile manner in which you are being treated.
AEPi has, by the way, very strict policies against sexual assault, harassment, and intimidation. We work with our brothers in as many ways as we possibly can to reinforce these policies. As a fraternity dedicated to developing leadership for Jewish communities and based in Jewish values, we take seriously our obligation to “Love Your Neighbor as Yourself.” AEPi is based on inclusion and respect of people of all genders, races, religions, orientation, or beliefs.
Unfortunately, the current undergraduate members of AEPi could not stand strong to the pressures proposed by the administration and decided to make the individual choice to no longer be a member of the AEPi chapter at Harvard. That’s certainly their right, but their capitulation to this discriminatory policy―and the assumption that men cannot operate in a group without doing something wrong―is beyond offensive.
I’m sorry that our current members opted to drop their membership in AEPi. They would have continued to reap the benefits of our leadership opportunities (here are just a few of them) and a brotherhood that has had a positive impact on tens of thousands. The campus community and the world’s Jewish community should be allowed to continue to benefit from an active and positive AEPi chapter at Harvard. We hope to soon find more members who are both looking to benefit from AEPi’s opportunities and willing to stand up to the University administration’s cynical policies.
Just as importantly, though, is the concern that I and others have who work daily with University students: that administrators can, with no repercussions, make assumptions about groups of people and deny them their constitutional right of assembly. The long term impacts of that are chilling.
Andrew Borans is the executive director of Alpha Epsilon Pi International Fraternity.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, we published a staff editorial criticizing Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana for his decision to reject a proposed pre-matriculation bridge program for low-income and first generation College freshmen. In our editorial, we asked Dean Khurana to explain his reasons for rejecting the program; he and Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ’67 have done so in their recent op-ed.
We thank Dean Khurana and Dean Dingman for responding to student criticism surrounding this decision, but we remain confident that a pre-matriculation program would be invaluable for first generation, low-income, and under-resourced students throughout their transition.
We support administrators’ new initiatives to expand post-matriculation resources, but we do not believe these resources negate the need for pre-matriculation support. Dean Khurana and Dean Dingman argued that bolstered post-matriculation resources, including a new “First Gen, Low-Income Student Advocate” in the Freshman Dean’s Office, would be sufficient to help support these students. They correctly note that post-matriculation resources are often underused.
In our view, however, the problem is not a lack of demand but a lack of awareness. Students do not know these resources are available or do not know how to access them. A pre-matriculation bridge program could help resolve the problem of underutilization, as it would teach incoming freshmen about these resources. While the Deans acknowledge the need to further support first generation, low-income students, they have yet to explain why expanding post-matriculation resources would be incompatible with a summer bridge program. Post-matriculation and pre-matriculation are not mutually exclusive, and they should not be viewed as such.
Furthermore, we believe that a summer bridge program would be able to provide preventative rather than remedial measures for these students on campus. Programming should be designed so that if students face academic and emotional struggles, they already know how to seek help from the FDO, Bureau of Study Counsel, or the First Gen Low-Income Advocate. It would ensure that these students do not feel alone in their challenges and have the tools to succeed before they even know they need them.
Many first generation, low-income, and minority students have been vocal about their desire for pre-matriculation support. They have worked hard to propose a solution to the problems they faced. Though the FDO has internal polling data about the success of pre- and post-matriculation support, these students’ views should be taken into account as well. We also urge administrators to be transparent, providing students with access to the data so they can help suggest solutions.
Given that the College has decided to focus its resources on post-matriculation support, we call for student involvement in the selection and hiring of the Advocate position in the FDO. First generation and low-income students can help ensure the new Advocate understands the experiences of those they are there to help. Further, the College should actively reach out to the would-be beneficiaries of the bridge program instead of placing the burden on the students to seek them.
We appreciate Dean Khurana and Dean Dingman’s commitment to providing resources for post-matriculation support. But we also hope that the bridge program is not forgotten and the dialogue continues, especially so that that pre-matriculation resources may be expanded in the future.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Unlike certain lunchtime eateries in certain science buildings on certain Cambridge campuses, some things never change. If you asked a cadet or midshipman fifty years ago why they decided to join ROTC, or why anyone might decide to join the military at all, you would be told something similar to what today’s cadets, midshipmen, and service members might say: at the core of every contract is service and sacrifice. The military does not ask you to merely participate, but to lead.
What a coincidence! Harvard prides itself on shaping and inspiring tomorrow’s leaders, and many of its students are similarly dedicated to serving their country and communities. (Except those Economics concentrators. They’re just in it for the money.)
Lightheartedness aside, Harvard and the U.S. military have a lot to offer each other, and share quite a legacy of leadership. From Revolutionary War minutemen to Civil War officers, the Harvard Regiment of 1916 to WWII heroes, even Vietnam to the Middle East, members of the Harvard community have been deeply involved in virtually every major combat operation since the nation’s founding, and often continue on to have distinguished civilian careers. Members of the administration routinely highlight the fact that Harvard has educated more Medal of Honor recipients than any other institution save for the two oldest service academies.
The darker parts of this legacy, though, have left some deep stains on the relationship between the two institutions over the last half-century. Before student protests permanently forced ROTC off-campus in the 1960’s, Harvard was commissioning nearly 100 officers total in all three branches every year out of a robust program run on-campus. In almost every year since 1969, no more than 10 officers have been commissioned each year, according to an Advocates for Harvard ROTC 2015 report. (Certainly, the size and needs of the military have changed, and it would be unreasonable to ever expect anything close to pre-1969 numbers. Nonetheless, the change is striking.)
The most profound tragedy that arose from this change was the emergence of a real ideological divide amongst students regarding Harvard and the military. While numerous op-eds waxed on and on about the utility of ROTC and whether or not it was antithetical to Harvard’s mission, it seems like no one cared to consider what ROTC’s expulsion would actually mean for their peers and classmates. At once, the military was out of sight, out of mind.
That is a costly gamble. Future civilian leadership can only benefit from engagement with members of the military here. Harvard students who dream of conducting foreign policy and managing national security tend to study those topics in abstraction, not always realizing some of their friends and peers will be the primary instruments of those policies. It’s one thing to make plans from an air-conditioned office in Foggy Bottom, but it’s another thing entirely to jump out of a plane and become “boots on the ground.”
Against the trends and attitudes of the last few decades, that so many students, faculty, and administrators are now more positive and supportive of ROTC and military members on campus is quite remarkable (again per the Advocates report). There is far more solidarity than division.
Many have lodged fair critiques of solidarity not being effectively translated into support. Since Navy ROTC was recognized in 2011, progress towards greater civil and military integration has felt excruciatingly slow. Air Force ROTC was recognized just last year. (The process of recognition still requires traversing a veritable mountain range of bureaucracy and paperwork, and does take a lot of time.) ROTC ranks have experienced more attrition than growth, and the presence of student veterans on campus is basically non-existent.
I struggle to believe that there are fewer than 10 students in classes of over 1600 that have been selected specifically for their commitment to excellence and community service who would be interested in becoming an officer in the U.S. military.
Neither Harvard nor its military counterparts will get very far on their own. It is encouraging to see within the last year how both institutions have collaborated to increase ROTC and the military’s presence on campus. There was a massive color guard detail for The Game, an exhibition in Pusey Library, and coverage in The Harvard Gazette and The Crimson. Even since my last column, the Harvard Army cadets have been informed that the number of ROTC scholarship recipients accepted in the Class of 2021 could double the size of our program next year. The eight current Navy freshmen doubled the size of Navy’s program this year.
This growth is hopefully indicative of a strengthening institutional relationship. I believe that the Harvard community at large wants this relationship to flourish and has a vested interest in it doing so. But if I have learned anything in the last year and a half, it is that translating solidarity into support takes time, and churning the wheels of two venerable bureaucracies takes even more time. Countless people work tirelessly to improve and manage Harvard and the military’s relationship, and a few years will not completely undo the damage that a nearly 50-year exile has done. Some tactical patience is required.

UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 10:54 a.m.
Electronic dance music DJ and producer Tiësto will headline Yardfest—the College’s annual outdoor spring concert—the College Events Board announced Tuesday evening, only three days before the Friday concert.
The Dutch Grammy-winning artist, known for tracks like “Wasted” and “Red Lights,” has published five studio albums including “A Town Called Paradise” in 2014.
“The CEB is so excited to bring Tiësto to campus,” CEB Yardfest Committee member Jackson M. Grigsby ’20 said in a press release. “It’s going to be a wild show.”
Yardfest is hosted by the College Events Board, a student-led programming board sponsored by the Office of Student Life that coordinates campus-wide social events for undergraduates. Prolonged contract negotiations delayed the announcement of this year’s headliner.
“In addition to his remarkable musical achievements, Tiësto is a leader in philanthropy, having headlined multiple concerts for charity including the Global Citizen Festival in Central Park,” the College Events Board wrote.
Electronic dance DJ Steve Aoki threw cakes into the crowded Tercentenary Theatre last year for Yardfest. Recent headliners have also included Jessie J, Janelle Monáe, Sara Bareilles, and Tyga.
Speculation about who would be headlining Yardfest started prematurely this year when early rumors swirled on social media that Carly Rae Jepsen and The Chainsmokers had been considered to headline the event in November. The CEB quickly denied that any final discussions were underway, although it did not stop devotees from hashing out the feud on Facebook pages supporting their artist.
Student performers Hello Cleveland and Kyle Ray will open for Tiësto after winning CEB’s Battle for Yardfest event in March. Hello Cleveland, a student rock band, is comprised of W. Gant Player ’19, Ryan D. Kerr ’17, Evan R. Sandhoefner ’17, Ben C. G. Lee ’17, and Chris G. Haley ’19.

As Harvard seeks to cope with disappointing endowment returns from last fiscal year, some of the University's twelve constituent schools will be harder hit than others, University President Drew G. Faust said in an interview last week.
Harvard posted low returns on its investments in fiscal year 2016, coming in second to the last in the Ivy League with a negative 2 percent return on its investments. Combined with other cash flows at the University, the largest educational endowment in the world took a hit of nearly $2 billion in endowment value.
Since then, some faculty members have said they are worried about the financial future of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and the University’s endowment more generally. But those fears—which have manifested in a stunted salary hike for faculty members in fiscal year 2018—may be exacerbated at Harvard’s smaller schools, where money allocated from the endowment makes up a considerable amount of their annual operating budgets.
Faust said each of the schools will be affected “differentially” by the endowment's performance. She.drew a comparison to the financial crisis in 2008 to describe how these schools might be particularly affected.
“For example, right after the financial crisis, the heavily endowment dependent schools like the Divinity School, were really struck because we had an almost 30 percent drop in the size of the endowment and substantial cutbacks because of that,” Faust said. “But the School of Public Health, which gets 70 percent of its money from soft money, outside funding—particularly federal grants—was much less directly affected.”
The two schools that are currently most heavily dependent on the endowment, according to data published by Harvard, are the Divinity School and the Radcliffe Institute, which rely on the endowment for 76 percent and 87 percent of their operating budgets, respectively. At the other extreme, The School of Public Health is the least dependent on the endowment, relying on the endowment for only 15 percent of its budget. It draws the majority of its budget, 67 percent, from “sponsored support” including a then-record-breaking $350 million gift from Gerald H. Chan in 2014.
Spokespeople from both schools declined to comment about ways that the endowment might pressure their budgets, though both indicated that they are eyeing fundraising as a way to offset the losses.
“We will continue to manage finances responsibly and fundraise,” Karla Strobel, a spokesperson for the Radcliffe Institute, wrote in an email.
With the prospect of having to tighten belts at different schools looming in the distance, Faust said that she was not aware of plans to reduce staff at any of the schools.
“We have adjustments in staff sizes, just on a normal basis, but beyond that—by normal basis I mean we start a new event, a new initiative, or an initiative disappears over time or something like that. But I’m not aware of any kind of systematic plans that a school might have,” Faust said.

UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 12:11 a.m. 
Classroom to Table, a popular program which provides students and faculty money to dine around Harvard Square, has run out of funds for the semester.
The program, which pays up to $25 per person for meals at Square restaurants for groups ranging from four to six people, has seen rapidly increasing popularity since its inception two years ago.
But this semester, facing financial constraints, the program has had to start turning groups of students and professors away.
“We had a set budget for the academic year and after very successful fall and spring terms, we have reached our funding limit and have closed our reservation form for the term,” Lauren E. Raece, an Office of Undergraduate Education administrator who oversees the program, wrote in an emailed statement.
The College partners with six participating restaurants, which receive direct payment from the College to cover groups’ meal costs.
The program closed for requests on April 7, with weeks still left in the spring semester.
According to Bryan L. Bu ’17, an inactive Crimson editor, one group of students recently tried to schedule a dinner through the site, but was alerted a few days before the meal that their application was not approved.  They later learned the program had run of out funds.
The group instead decided to have the scheduled meal, and pay for the food themselves.
“Because we loved our professor so much, we decided to continue anyway, even though it required us coming up with the funds ourselves, which we were happy to do, even though it wasn’t anticipated,” said Bryan L. Bu ’17.
Classroom to Table receives funding from Senior Gift, an initiative which encourages graduating members of the Class of 2017 to donate to Harvard. Seniors can choose to donate to either financial aid or an unrestricted fund that the College can use at its discretion.
A recent poster distributed by the Senior Class Committee advertised Classroom to Table as one of several initiatives that seniors could benefit by donating to Senior Gift.

UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 12:37 p.m.
The historic 1912 Conductor’s Building—the only surviving structure from Cambridge’s earliest subway system—is back in business, but this time without any subway cars. In their place, upscale restaurant Les Sablons opened its doors Tuesday for Cantabrigians pining for European cuisine.
The restaurant is headed by Boston restauranteurs Garrett Harker, Shore Gregory, Skip Bennett, and Jeremy Sewall. The partners’ other projects include popular Boston-area restaurants Branch Line, Eastern Standard, Island Creek Oyster Bar, and Row 34. Les Sablons—self-described as a restaurant “between London and Paris”—is named after a Paris subway station.
In a written statement, Les Sablons partner Shore Gregory said the restaurant has been interested in opening up in Harvard Square for approximately a year and is excited to join other establishments in the Square.
“We’re honored to have the opportunity to bring the Conductor’s Building to life," Gregory said. “Its significance was never lost on us.”
Denise A. Jillson, executive director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said she was excited about the opening of Les Sablons. She said the group had reached out to HSBA almost immediately after signing the property lease.
“We were excited that a well-known restaurant group was coming to town, but more importantly that they were so terrific about reaching out and wanting, way before they opened, to be part of the community,” Jillson said. “They have been attending meetings and participating in events to the extent that they could even before the restaurant opened, which really speaks volumes about the kind of people they are, really people that are invested in the community.”
The Conductor’s Building served as administrative offices for the Boston Elevated Railway, the earliest incarnation of the Cambridge Subway system. The thin, narrow brick structure stands at 2 Bennett St. across from the Charles Hotel.
Renovations started in 2014, and in 2016, it was announced that the space would be used for a restaurant. Les Sablons occupies two-stories, with a bar and seating downstairs and the main dining area upstairs.
“It’s really a fabulous building and unlike anything in the Square, given how long it is and how narrow it is,” Jillson said. “The restoration project was really moving along beautifully.”
Jillson said she was excited about the unique niche Les Sablons will fill in the Square as the only French-style restaurant and one of a few high-end options. She said she thought the menu was ideal for special occasions, but also imagines it becoming a popular spot for cocktails and small plates after work.
“It’s really, really special, and it’s fun, and the space is just so unusual, but they’ve done such a great job with the design, so kudos all around,” Jillson said.

Georgia Congressman John R. Lewis received the Kennedy School’s Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award at the Institute of Politics Tuesday afternoon, where he also spoke and answered student questions.
At the event, Lewis, who represents Georgia’s 5th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, said he felt “blessed” to receive the Gleitsman Award, which honors politicians “who have sparked positive social change.”
Lewis is also known for his role in the Civil Rights Movement, and helped organize the 1963 March on Washington while chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
At the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum Tuesday, Lewis answered questions about his activism, speaking at length about his childhood in Alabama.
Lewis detailed one incident in particular when he was required to sit on a movie theater balcony with other black children as one that evoked feelings of alienation. He added that other famous activists like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks inspired him to resist racism across the country.
“I grew up in rural Alabama, as you’ve heard. I tasted the bitter fruits of racism,” Lewis said. “Then, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. inspired me to get in trouble, and I’ve been getting in trouble ever since.”
He also encouraged students in attendance to get involved in politics and activism, and emphasized the need for resilience in sparking change.
“You get beaten, you get knocked down, you get arrested a few times. It makes you stronger, it makes you more determined,” Lewis said.
The question and answer session was moderated by Business School professor Nancy F. Koehn and ImeIme A. Umana '14, who became the first black woman to lead the Harvard Law Review earlier this year.
Lewis also spoke about the need to confront painful parts of United States history. Last year, Lewis joined University President Drew G. Faust at a ceremony honoring four slaves who worked and lived on Harvard’s campus.
“As a nation, we never apologized for slavery, we never apologized for the way we treated so many people,” he said.
In 2008, Lewis co-sponsored a bill that formally apologized for slavery and Jim Crow laws. It passed the House of Representatives unanimously.
Reflecting on the United States’ current political climate, Lewis—an open critic of President Donald Trump—said he is hopeful about the future of the Democratic Party.
“We are in a process, with new leadership, of rebuilding the Democratic Party from the bottom up. On the congressional level, you see Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, and individuals trying to reclaim the House, reclaim the Senate. Working, pooling resources. We will not give up and give in, we’re going to have some great victories,” he said.
Towards the end of his remarks, Lewis encouraged soon-to-be Harvard graduates to get involved in public service.
“To all of the graduates:  you’ve been well-educated, you have skills, you’re smart, you’re beautiful, you’re handsome —get out there and help society… you have a moral obligation to do your best for all humanity and mankind,” he said.

As the Faculty of Arts and Sciences struggles with budget constraints, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences—the recently-endowed wing of FAS—is continuing with “measured growth” and plans to partner with outside firms to generate additional revenue.
After the value of Harvard’s endowment plunged by almost $2 billion in fiscal year 2016, the University has had to tighten its budgets. In FAS, the number of graduate students admitted next year has been cut 4.4 percent and faculty and graduate students will only receive a 1.5 percent pay bump next year.
Despite the financial turbulence at the rest of FAS, SEAS is continuing with plans for expanding the size of its faculty and student body. In an interview last week, SEAS Dean Francis J. Doyle III said the “school within a school” has focused on keeping expenses low—rather than cutting back.
“We operate on our own budget, we are an independent school in that regard, so consequently we, too, have to worry about balancing a budget,” Doyle said.  “We have a growth plan even through the next few years of uncertainty that we will stabilize that number, and then the hope is that I will be able to improve that number as well.”
The number of students at SEAS has ballooned in recent years. At the time of its inception in 2007, there were 291 SEAS undergraduate concentrators. After SEAS welcomed 320 new sophomores in November, it now has a record-high 943 total concentrators.
“I am deeply concerned about things like student faculty ratio, and I endeavor to at least hold the line on that,” he said.
Doyle said that SEAS is considering partnering with industry firms as a new way to generate revenue. He pointed to current practice at Harvard Business School, where in October 2010 Ratan Tata—chairman of the Indian conglomerate Tata Group—gave the largest international gift to date to the school. The $50 million was used to build Tata Hall, the new home for the Executive Education program.
“We’re wrestling with the budget just like Mike Smith, and the other schools around Harvard, and we are trying to be creative with new revenue and very disciplined approaches to expenses,” Doyle said.
In addition to Harvard’s budget, Doyle said “uncertainty in Washington” is something he is keeping an eye on.
He also said the number of graduate students remained the same this year, despite the fact that FAS student admissions is being cut.
“We actually kept the same number of grad students this year. My thought on that is that the number of grad students will more or less float with the number of faculty because the faculty bring in the grants that pays for the students, so if the faculty are increasing and bringing in more research revenue then we will have to have a commensurate increase in the number of grad students,” Doyle said.
Hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson endowed SEAS with a $400 million gift in 2015, renaming the school.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: April 19, 2017 at 2:12 a.m.
Graduate members of the Delphic Club hired strippers to entertain a handful of undergraduates at an October 2010 punch event held in a graduate’s South Boston apartment.
In a series of emails sent in October 2010, the members describe plans to eat a late dinner together at a restaurant before traveling to the graduate member’s apartment to drink. They also discuss hiring two women from Shamrock Entertainment, a company which bills itself as “New England’s #1 source for the finest female and male exotic dancers and strippers for any occasion.”
“Shamrock Entertainment has promised me two of their finest, classiest, beautiful young ladies for tomorrow night,” Christopher J. Rouches ’10, a graduate member of the Delphic, wrote in an email to a group of Delphic graduates organizing the event. “So, the more Alumni support the better.”
“You won’t want to miss the seamless transitions on the double-ender (you’ll see what I mean tomorrow, it’s truly awe inspiring),” added Rouches, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
The emails, which until recently were publicly available through the email service Google Groups, illustrate some Delphic members’ attempts to entice sophomores at the College to join their ranks in 2010. In this case, those efforts took the form of hundreds of dollars spent on food, alcohol, and erotic entertainment.
“We have entertainment lined up at our place at 11, so we’re hoping to get there at 10 and play edward 40-hands pre-show,” Thomas E. Southworth ’09, another graduate, wrote. “The entertainment is 350 before tips/extracurriculars.”
The 2010 event formed part of that year’s iteration of the Delphic’s punch—the secretive weeks—long process by which final clubs select new members at a series of events. Graduate members of these clubs sometimes participate in punch, planning and hosting events.
Southworth wrote in an email to Delphic graduates at the time that he had decided to “run point on the younger grad Boston punch dinners” for the 2010 season.
In a later email, he detailed the schedule for the evening’s festivities, and asked that each graduate pay for one punch “the whole way through.”
“We’ll have plenty to drink,” he added. “Should be a fun night… Fucking pumped.”
In an emailed statement Tuesday, Southworth wrote that he did not receive official approval for the 2010 event from the Delphic.
“This was an isolated event hosted by a small number of recent graduates in Boston seven years ago,” Southworth wrote. “The event was sanctioned neither by Harvard nor the Delphic Club and should not reflect negatively on either.”
“It should not have happened then and would not happen today,” he added.
John R. S. Jacobsson ’90, the Delphic’s graduate board president, declined to comment for this story.
In an interview Tuesday, a Shamrock Entertainment employee who identified himself as the office manager—but refused to give his name—said that he did not remember the 2010 event specifically. A 2005 Crimson magazine article described final clubs occasionally hiring strippers for punch events.
“What happens at the shows is pretty confidential. Customers do their things—it’s just our business to bring customers the entertainment,” the man said. “The adult entertainers get there, they do their job, and they leave.”
Details about the 2010 punch event come at a time when the Delphic is grappling with pressure from Harvard to accept women as members. In May 2016, University President Drew G. Faust announced penalties on undergraduate members of single-gender social organizations, barring these students from certain fellowships, leadership positions, and athletic team captaincies starting with the Class of 2021.
In a letter to alumni obtained by The Crimson last May, graduate president Jacobsson and graduate vice-president David S. DeSimone ’98 laid out reasons for and against adding women to the club. The letter also mentioned that the Delphic was exploring the possibility of a merger with a female final club, and had already held “introductory meetings” with the all-female Bee, IC, and La Vie clubs.
But recent Delphic Club members did not seem interested. The letter estimated that undergraduate members at that time would vote against adding women as members “by a healthy majority.”
In a publicly available email sent to graduate members of the Delphic at the start of the 2010 punch process in September, then-undergraduate Delphic members Nigel Munoz ’12 and John K. “J.T.” Tomes Jr. ’12, who led that year’s punch, thanked graduates for their contributions to punch events in the past. They added that they hoped members would remain involved in the upcoming weeks.
“May I just take the time to thank the large numbers of you who continue to be involved with the club and help every year to make the Delphic punch process unrivaled amongst the finals clubs,” Munoz wrote. “Both myself and J.T. were heavily influenced by dinners and trips made possible by the generosity of graduate members and this is a tradition we hope to continue.”
Munoz went on to outline a broad schedule for that year’s punch process—including trips to Washington D.C. and New York—writing that he and Tomes aimed to have “as many dinners and events hosted or aided by graduate members as possible.”
“It goes without saying that as many of our punches as possible will be wined and dined in and around Boston during that time period,” he wrote.

Congressman John Lewis, who represents Georgia’s 5th district, received the Kennedy School's 2017 Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award during an event at the Institute of Politics Tuesday. The ensuing conversation was moderated by ImeIme Umana, president of the Harvard Law Review, and Nancy F. Koehn of the Business School, and Lewis fielded questions from students and members of the broader Harvard community. 
David Gergen presents Rep. Lewis with the 2017 Gleitsman Citizen Activist Award, co-sponsored by the Center for Public Leadership that he co-directs. Gergen is a Public Service Professor at the Kennedy School. 
John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum is packed for the conversation that follows the award presentation. The conversation was moderated by ImeIme Umana, the first African American woman to be elected president of the Harvard Law Review and the first African American to to this position since President Barack Obama, and Nancy F. Koehn, the James E. Robinson chair of Business Administration at the Business School.
Responding to a question from Harvard senior William A. Greenlaw, Lewis stresses the importance of activism both within a system and without it, illustrating with an example from his own life: he found that joining marches while working in Congress was not mutually exclusive.
David L. Evans, a senior admissions officer in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, asks about effective methods to engage college students in activism.
A graduate student shares a desire to run for office, and she inquires about the traits Lewis considers important for a potential candidate.

In response, Lewis says, "Just run for office." He says, lightheartedly, that one important trait a candidate needs is to like people—because some people "love the world, but then they hate people."
Harvard senior Amanda J.N. Mozea shares her experience of an alternate spring break spent in Mississippi focused on civil rights and the profound effect it had on her. She asks how to translate that experience to people around her.
A Gleitsman fellow asks Lewis to share any poignant moments of vulnerability in his journey. In response, Lewis shares emotional personal anecdotes of final moments he shared with John F. Kennedy Jr., Martin Luther King Jr., and Robert F. Kennedy before their respective assassinations, describing them as his "heroes."
Lewis responds to the last of several standing ovations of the evening, taking time to acknowledge all sections of audience.
After the forum, throngs of attendees vie for a minute of the congressman's time for photographs, autographs or to share a word of gratitude.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As Boston’s spring weather finally begins to settle in, two groups in particular are especially thankful: the Harvard men’s and women’s golf teams.
With snow still covering the ground late into March, the teams have had to adjust to practicing and playing away from their traditional home course at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass.
While the teams were able to begin on-course training around mid-February last spring season, this season they have relied more on indoor training, according to sophomore Michelle Xie. As a result, the groups have had to make the most out of their trips to more temperate playing conditions in the South.
“Our season started much later this year compared to the past,” Xie said. “We will see how this might affect us in our final few tournaments, but we definitely feel prepared to play in the Ivy League Championships.”
This season so far has seen two such trips for both teams. Over spring break, the men’s and women’s teams embarked on a week-long trip to Delray Beach, Fla., where they had an informal weekend match against Lynn University. Two weeks later, Harvard’s women’s team returned again to Florida to play in their very own Harvard Invitational at The Oaks Club in Sarasota.
“The purpose of our spring break trips is to be able to play in real grass and good weather,” said men’s captain Daniel De La Garza. “We always switch up the location every year and it is always great trip for us, especially when Boston is snowing all the time.”
As much as these weekend tournaments to the South have benefited the golf teams, maintaining high levels of performance during the winter months has come primarily through the teams’ state-of-the-art indoor training facility.  Renovated in 2011, the indoor amenities include 24/7 access for varsity golfers to four hitting stations, a Trackman launch monitor to simulate real-life ball movements, and a 2,000 square foot putting green.
“The indoor practice facility is definitely helpful for our training,” Xie said. “The Trackman is really useful because when hitting off the nets it is difficult to judge where the balls would be going in real life. So being able to use the simulator rather than just hit ten yards to a net has really helped my game.”
In addition, the team went through intensive fitness and strength offseason workouts designed specifically for golf from the Titleist Performance Institute. These workouts targeted core strengthening, improving balance, and developing upper-body strength.
“Although we have very few practices in the winter, we continue to improve our games by working out and keeping our fitness in the gym,” De La Garza said. “Our season starts February 1st, but when the weather is an issue in the first few months we keep a strong mentality and make the most out of our opportunities.”
With these resources, the Harvard golf teams have done their best to mitigate the tough winter conditions. Even so, the inevitable Northeast storm or violently windy day can hit, often unexpectedly. In these circumstances, Harvard players have learned how to adjust their games and now consider it a part of their day-to-day lives.
For example, during the recent Princeton Invitational on April 8 and April 9, the men’s golf team faced more than an inch of rain in addition to gusting winds in their match at Springdale Country Club.
“I think we handled the conditions well, though the scores were worse for each team across the board on that Friday morning,” sophomore Aurian Capart said. “We powered through it, but given the weather, we did not know what to expect.”
Even with these difficult conditions, the Crimson finished second overall. Capart himself led the team, shooting a team-low 209 after three rounds and earning a second-place finish.
The women’s golf team faced similar situations throughout this spring season. In fact, the team made the last-minute decision to play at the Navy Invitational in Annapolis, Md., after their previous tournament was canceled due to weather concerns.
“We are definitely still competitive within our conference,” Xie said. “The weather is obviously one of the factors you have to consider playing here at Harvard, but overall it is still just staying focused on what you and your team are trying to accomplish during the season.”
Like Xie, who grew up in Southern California, the majority of both Harvard’s men’s and women’s golf teams learned and developed their games in warmer climates. Yet, these new experiences playing in the Northeast as well as facing opponents in tournaments in the South have improved their own versatility and mental toughness, according to De La Garza.
“Many people could see playing golf in Boston as a challenge or obstacle,” De La Garza said. “But our team actually becomes stronger mentally because of the weather. Here at Harvard, we don’t practice for quantity, but rather for quality.”
This type of mentality has propelled De La Garza, who is from Monterrey, Mexico, to become an important leader for the Crimson. On the golf course, De La Garza utilized the mental consistency to earn second-team All Ivy honors in his junior season. He believes that his positive attitude in dealing with the weather will be an important message to pass on to younger teammates as well.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sean Malone wanted nothing more than to play his final hockey game of the season last Saturday in Chicago. But Sunrise, Florida wasn’t such a bad alternative.
Less than 48 hours after Harvard bowed out of the Frozen Four on April 6 at the United Center, Malone received the opportunity of a lifetime—a chance to suit up for his hometown team, the Buffalo Sabres.
The Sabres announced on April 8 that they had signed Malone, their sixth-round draft choice in 2013, to a two-year entry-level deal. And by night’s end, the 6-foot 190-pound forward had been penciled in as Buffalo’s fourth-line center against the Florida Panthers.
Sporting the number 42, Malone received 12:12 of ice time, finished 5-for-8 at the faceoff dot, and registered one shot on goal in his National Hockey League debut.
“[The team] got together and watched it, so I got to see every shift,” senior Luke Esposito said. “I think all of us agree that he deserves that opportunity. He was a standout in college and especially this year being healthy, you got to see the true extent of his skills and his speed on the ice.”
Suiting up for a career-high 36 games, Malone more than doubled his previous high in points with 42—third-best on the Crimson. And in his first professional stint, he looked like he “fully fit in,” according to Esposito.
The opportunity was the culmination of a lifelong dream for Malone, who said in the lead-up to the Frozen Four that “growing up as a kid from [the Buffalo] area, you want to eventually put on that Blue and Gold.” But the senior also acknowledged that he hadn’t been thinking about hockey after Harvard during the season—something Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 reaffirmed.
“One of the things our guys have done a great job with—and it started out with Jimmy [Vesey ’16] and continued on this year—is they’ve really dedicated themselves to the moment and to the team now,” Donato said. “I think that’s a real tribute to the type of character kids that we have.”
“I wasn’t caught off guard with the opportunity that Sean had,” the coach continued. “But I think he had his focus 110 percent on his Harvard Hockey opportunity. And I think that’s all you can ask for as a coach or a teammate.”
As part of said Harvard Hockey opportunity, Malone played on an all-senior—and now all-signed—second line. Malone’s linemates, Tyler Moy and Esposito, both signed professional contracts after their center became the first to break the ice.
On April 10, the Nashville Predators announced that they had inked Moy, a sixth-rounder in 2015, to a two-year entry-level deal. Moy said the Predators understood that they should give him “space to go through all the emotions of a collegiate career ending,” but the two sides ultimately wound up discussing a contract the day after Harvard’s elimination.
Moy, along with the members of his inner circle, all agreed that the Predators’ organization offered him the best fit. The San Diego, Calif., native said that since being drafted by Nashville after his sophomore season, he has been treated exceptionally well by the club.
So he closed the deal. And now Moy has joined the Milwaukee Admirals, the Predators’ American Hockey League affiliate, to close out the 2016-2017 season.
“Obviously it’s a pretty exciting time and something you dream about as a kid,” Moy said. “I couldn’t be more excited to be here in Milwaukee and try to help out the Admirals in any way I can, especially leading into the playoffs. It’s a really great opportunity for me, and I couldn’t be more thankful for it.”
In his senior season, Moy logged a Crimson-best 22 goals and finished tied with co-captain Alexander Kerfoot for the team lead in points with 45. Meanwhile, the 6’1” forward continues to produce, having logged at least a point in each of his first three games with the Admirals.
Furthermore, Moy netted his first professional goal Saturday against the Grand Rapids Griffins, home of not only ex-Harvard co-captain Kyle Criscuolo ’16, but also as of a week ago, Esposito.
Esposito signed a one-year deal with the Griffins for the 2017-2018 season, which was announced by the team last Wednesday. The undrafted forward from Greenwich, Conn., also signed an amateur tryout contract for the rest of the Griffins’ current campaign, but he will not begin playing for the team until next season.
“It’s a long-time dream of a lot of players to get a chance to play professional hockey,” Esposito said. “Just to play hockey after college and get paid to do it, it’s pretty special.”
Esposito said that the Griffins formally expressed an interest in him midway through the season; however as a byproduct of the Griffins’ scouting of Criscuolo, Esposito had already been on their radar. The 5’10” forward’s breakout senior campaign only stood to help his status; Esposito followed up three straight five-goal seasons with 16 lamp-lighters and 36 points in his final go.
As a result, Esposito’s now a signed professional—just like his two former linemates. But in Esposito’s own words, all three are now rookies yet again, starting from “ground zero.”
“It might be a long time until we get to find a line that’s that consistent with that chemistry,” Esposito said. “We didn’t take it for granted and we enjoyed it as much as we could…. Now we’re all looking to move on.”

Now that the Yardfest headliner has been announced, anxiety about whether the annual event is happening has hopefully dissolved. In the absence of those doubts, the most important thing you should be worrying about right now is how to reach the optimal level of litness come Friday. We've compiled some beginner's tips to help make Yardfest amazing:
Have your schedule clear
Imagine realizing you have a pset due in 20 minutes while you are grinding on a random bro-tank dude (spoiler alert: it’s not pretty). Finish your work in advance unless you want to listen to Tiësto through Lamont's walls.
Don’t get too lit
Although party hopping is the most fun part of the day, too many amateurs end up missing out on the concert itself. Pace yourself unless you want to experience Yardfest only through your friends’ snaps or, worse, at UHS.
Wear something simple
No matter how much you want to channel the Coachella boho glam style, please wear something you will not regret ruining. Between the HUDS buffet, dirt, mud, and some other questionable stains, your cute outfit might not survive the night. And don’t forget to protect your toes from crazy moshing kids by wearing closed-toe shoes. You will thank us later.
Prepare for the social media frenzy 
Charge your phone so that you can Snapchat, Instagram and tweet the day (and night) away. If you’re not planning on attending, temporarily delete all social apps to prevent the biggest FOMO in your life. 
Don’t make everyone hate you
Elbowing your way to the front, yelling “I love you” to the artist or even trying to climb up the stage is seriously not cool even if you’re Tiësto’s biggest fan. You might not remember your rudeness the next day, but we will. You may even get a Dude, That's Rude post written about you.
Take our advice but don’t worry too much—Yardfest is supposed to be messy. No matter what you do, there’s still a chance that you’ll wake up in fetal position at 2 p.m. the next day. Embrace the upcoming wildness and leave a glass—er, jug—of water near your bed, just in case.

Listen up, pre-frosh: although you might have your Visitas schedules tightly packed with events tricking you into thinking our college has a social scene, they might not always reflect your future experience here. Seriously, if you think that college is all about ice-cream socials, decorating cupcakes, and welcoming social spaces, maybe you should choose the arts and crafts school of New Haven (not really tho). To help you make the most of admitted students’ weekend, we've compiled a list of things you just have to do to get an ~authentic~ Harvard experience (sans the all-nighter induced tears and feelings of inadequacy). 
Sit around the Yard
Gather your Visitas besties and soak up the spring sunshine on the Yard’s famed lawn. Wrestle a lawn chair or two from some tourists or catch Dean Dingman pensively smiling at your wholesome naïveté while real Harvard students are barricaded in Lamont.
Go on a (dry) River Run
Tour the upperclassmen houses but instead of the Rubinoff your host handed you with a wink, drink plenty of water. Don’t get too cocky—you’re not a student here and the amnesty policy, while a good reason to pick Harvard, doesn’t apply to you. Don’t get too lit if you want to bring brochures and free t-shirts home instead of a rescinded letter of admission.
Eat at 3 a.m.
While your helicopter parents might be horrified at the thought of you chowing down greasy Harvard Square food long past your bedtime, your college career will be full of wee-hour binges. Start training for future grease-marathons and check out our top late night picks: El Jefes (hearty Mexican food), Tasty Burger (semi-tasty burgers), Insomnia (the best damn cookies of your life), Kong (greasy Chinese food), and a 24-hour CVS (for those who stay up really late). After all, the novelty of Annenberg will wear off quicker than you think.
Watch the sunrise from the Charles River
Enjoy the river view of our beautiful campus that actually looks like the brochures. The collegiate look of the sunlit brick buildings will make you want to see this beauty on the regular.
Pee on the Statue
While the other two Harvard traditions might be hard to execute in your position (do pre-frosh even have Widener swipe access?), jumpstart your bucket list and give John H the good ol’ golden shower. The story of how you marked the statue will forever distinguish you from the foot-touching tourists and give you major props back in high school.
Check out Eleganza
April 22 marks Harvard’s biggest fashion and dance show that will certainly make a lasting impression with its electrifying performances. Although the breathtaking Eleganza models are not exactly representative of the sweatpants-clad student body, this display of human magnificence will prove that we’ve got the moves and that we’re the hottest Ivy #watchoutBrown.

After months of fickle Cambridge weather, it finally has started warming up enough for the student populace to break out the salmon shorts, Birkenstocks, and start kickin’ it in the Yard. We all want to enjoy the weather as much as the next person, but there’s always those choice few types that make us want to lock ourselves inside. This spring, don’t be these people. 
Guitar Kid
Listen, we’re all about music and promoting the arts at Harvard, but not when your art is Creep by Radiohead on an acoustic guitar you bought in sophomore year of highschool and there’s nowhere else for us to run to. No, “you don’t belong here.” If you’re gonna play music, make sure you’re not right up against people trying to speed-write their term papers. The Yard’s big enough for all of us, so please don’t force us to listen to Wonderwall or any Coldplay, please.
Spikeballers
If the weather’s above 55 degrees, you can guarantee someone has set up their Spikeball camp and is smacking away. Now, there’s nothing wrong with Spikeball itself if you’ve set up a space for yourself on the grass far away from everyone else. But, when you make the people around you have to duck every time your shirtless friend spikes it too hard, you make the Yard a danger zone for all innocent passerbys. Keep your distance and Spikeball in peace. (And put a shirt on.)
Chair Hogs
There aren’t nearly enough of those $300 artisan chairs to go around, so for the love of all things good, do not use a chair for your feet or your backpack. Although you might like to think so, you aren’t royalty, and you can put your feet on the ground like all the other plebeians. Plus, no one wants to sit down on a chair full of Yard dirt once you’ve vacated the premises. And if you squirreled a Yard chair away in your dorm room all winter, please kindly return it to the collective.
Trash Monsters
The Yard is essentially a wide expanse of dirt right now, so please keep the little grass we have left clean. When you’re done with your Starbucks Frappuccino or your Liquiteria Kale Juice with Apple Lemon and Ginger, throw the cup out, will ya?  No one needs to be tripping over your trash while taking a nice stroll through the Yard.
The Yard is a great space for everyone to hang out in between classes, to picnic, and to soak up some rays while getting some work in. Make it a place everyone can thoroughly enjoy by keeping Flyby’s suggestions for Yard Courtesy, or else we'll have to tell you—rather forcibly since you'll be sullying our warm weather mood—dude, that's rude.
