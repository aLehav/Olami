After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is prohibiting all official international and non-essential domestic University air travel and “strongly discourages” any nonessential meetings with more than 100 attendees, according to a University-wide email sent by University Provost Alan M. Garber ’76, Executive Vice President Katie N. Lapp, and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen Friday afternoon.
Academic classes and dining operations remain normal, but with “heightened cleaning protocols,” they wrote.
“Meetings or events of any size should be reconsidered,” a University webpage for coronavirus-related advisory information now reads.
The University also encouraged affiliates to prepare to work from home and replace in-person meetings with teleconferencing.
The novel coronavirus has infected 95,333 people worldwide as of Friday morning, according to the World Health Organization. The virus now poses a “very high” risk on a global level, according to the organization.
Harvard Women in Computer Science announced the cancellation of its annual WeCode conference — originally scheduled for this weekend — in a statement Thursday, citing an advisory from University officials against international and nonessential domestic travels.
By Friday noon, Massachusetts had one confirmed and another seven presumptive positive cases of COVID-19, according to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. Two schools in Wellesley, Mass. dismissed students early on Friday when a parent tested positive for the virus, according to a school announcement.
Harvard’s announcement listed preventative measures to stay healthy, including coughing and sneezing into one’s arm, replacing handshakes with elbow bumps, and washing hands more often than usual.
In addition to the suggested habits, the announcement also encouraged people to prepare devices to work from home and practice using Zoom.
They wrote in the email that University leaders and school officials are meeting frequently.
“We recognize the challenges this coronavirus outbreak presents for our community and we appreciate everyone’s cooperation, assistance, and ongoing efforts to prevent the transmission of disease,” they wrote.
He added that the University will continue to send regular announcements and update Harvard’s coronavirus website.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard College has canceled Visitas, its annual admitted students weekend, due to concerns over the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid William R. Fitzsimmons ’67 announced to admitted students in a Friday email.
Fitzsimmons wrote that the College plans to replace the on-campus programming with a series of online events and videos that will be called “Virtual Visitas.”
“Rather than be confined to three days, these videos and sessions will be available to all admitted students throughout the month of April,” Fitzsimmons wrote.
There are no confirmed cases of the Coronavirus disease among Harvard affiliates, according to Fitzsimmons. Health officials have so far identified eight cases in Massachusetts, and three employees of a Cambridge-based company Biogen have tested positive for the virus. While none of those employees reside in Massachusetts, all attended a meeting in Boston last week.
Official counts have identified more than 100,000 cases globally, with over 250 cases in the United States. As the numbers of cases grows, the CDC has suspended entry into the United States from China and Iran. Additionally, they have discouraged nonessential travel to South Korea and Italy.
In response, Harvard College has prohibited all University-related international and domestic travel. Additionally, the College requires anyone returning from a CDC level 3 travel warning country to self-isolate for a minimum of 14 days.
Fitzsimmons wrote that the College made the decision in response to recommendations from the Massachusetts state officials and representatives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology similarly announced the decision to cancel its respective admitted students weekend scheduled for April yesterday evening.
Every spring, Harvard welcomes hundreds of prospective students to campus for Visitas, where on-campus organizations host events and students and faculty discuss life at Harvard.
Visitas was last canceled in 2013 as law enforcement officers searched for one of the suspects involved in the Boston Marathon bombings.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Harvard’s senior night, it was Brown’s senior sharpshooter Zach Hunsaker who stole the show at Lavietes Pavilion Friday, scoring 20 points and hitting a dagger three pointer with four minutes left to extend the lead to 11 and shock the Crimson 64-55, snapping a six game winning streak and keeping the Bears in the hunt for their first ever Ivy League tournament berth.
Hunsaker keyed Brown’s offensive performance, hitting four triples in the first half for a team that had connected on just 26.5 percent of its long range efforts in Ancient Eight play before Friday. The Bears (14-12, 7-6 Ivy League) led by three points at halftime in large part thanks to  their scalding 6-of-10 performance from deep.
“Hunsaker was the difference,” head coach Tommy Amaker said. “On the big [three] late, we went under the screen and he nailed a big one when we were trying to get a stop there. So I just thought he was the difference and they deserved to win tonight.”
While Harvard (20-8, 9-4) survived Brown’s first half three point shooting barrage, it could not withstand a 7:20 scoreless drought early in the second half, a stretch in which the Crimson missed 10 consecutive shots and the Bears extended what had been just a two point lead early in the second half to 13. Harvard managed just 25 points overall in the second half and 14 in the half’s first 16 minutes as it suffered its first home loss this season.
The Crimson cut into the lead a little bit late, and a basket by Tretout would have made it a five point affair with 30 seconds left, but the freshman guard could not convert the open layup, which was indicative of Harvard’s lackluster offensive performance.
Sophomore guard Noah Kirkwood paced the team with 14 points, while Lewis and Tretout chipped in 13 and a career-high 11 apiece. But aside from Lewis, who had success on the rare occasions that he was single-teamed down low, hammering home three one-handed dunks, the offense was exceedingly inefficient. The rest of the team shot just 25 percent from the field and was often sloppy with the ball, making a number of ill-advised entry passes to Lewis and racking up 15 turnovers against eight assists.
Hunsaker was joined in double figures by shifty senior point guard Brandon Anderson, who scored 14 points but forced a number of difficult shots in the second half and was held to 4-of-17 shooting, and junior forward Tamenang Choh, the hero of the first meeting between these teams.
The Crimson was playing its second full game without senior point guard Christian Juzang, who injured his ankle last weekend and has been ruled out for Saturday’s game against Yale. Juzang has a good chance to return for next weekend’s tournament, something that cannot be said about fellow injured senior guards Seth Towns and Bryce Aiken.
“It has kind of been a point guard by collective this season,” senior guard Justin Bassey said. “All of us have taken time there, rotating through it, seeing if we can find kind of a rhythm. That’s been a big thing that we’ve talked about.”
The loss put a bit of a damper on the senior nights of Harvard’s seven seniors, who formed the heralded Class of 2016 recruiting class and who before this year had won consecutive Ivy League regular season championships.
“Definitely emotional,” Bassey said of senior night. “It’s crazy how fast this came up. I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude, who we owe for things that have happened. It’s amazing to have family here supporting, friends. Definitely a tough loss for us but we have to turn the page and try to channel those into the right way to play.”
The Crimson’s senior class will have one last chance to secure an elusive spot in the Big Dance. Harvard’s loss combined with Yale’s win at Dartmouth clinches the regular season title for the Bulldogs and locks the Crimson into the second or third seed, ensuring that Harvard will face Princeton next Saturday in the tournament’s semifinals.
Brown, which won a nailbiter in Providence in the first matchup between the teams, notched its first season sweep of the Crimson since 2008. But for the Bears to sneak into the Ivy League tournament as the fourth seed, they will need to beat Dartmouth tomorrow night in Hanover while Columbia, losers of 12 straight league games, sees off Penn in Philadelphia.
While Harvard’s game against Yale Saturday night will be meaningless as far as tournament matchups go, Amaker stressed the importance of coming out strong in the team’s final regular season game.
“We need to find a way to win, play well and try to win,” Amaker said. “We were coming off of winning six in a row coming into this game and we’re playing Yale and it’s the final regular season home game of the year for us so there’s a ton for us to try to accomplish in this game tomorrow. They’re the best team in our league and that can give us a tremendous amount of confidence going into the conference tournament if we can find a way to find a good rhythm.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Come Saturday’s Game Two between the Harvard men’s hockey team and St. Lawrence, one team had everything to play for. The Saints, down by one game in this best-of-three series, would need to win to keep their series alive. Certainly the visitors had controlled stretches of play in the first game, though the Crimson emerged victorious. Ultimately, however, the course of this second contest would be very different from the one before it.
Where Friday night was a more closely-contested game, Harvard (15-10-6, 11-6-5 ECAC) jumped out to a lead early on Saturday and never looked back, besting St. Lawrence (4-27-5, 2-19-2) by a score of 7-1. Two powerplay tallies and five different goal-scorers powered the hosts’ effort, earning the Crimson a 2-0 series victory and a trip to the ECAC quarterfinals.
“We’re excited to be able to move on,” head coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “Today we were able to get off to a good start and create some separation, [and] made some pretty skilled plays… I give a lot of credit to St. Lawrence… There’s no easy playoff series in this league.”
The St. Lawrence coaching staff made a change between the pipes after the Game One loss. Senior Daniel Mannella (3.07 GAA, .906 SV%) started instead of rookie Francis Boisvert (3.50 GAA, .897 SV%). Mannella was in net for both of the Saints’ clashes against Harvard this season, and so had seen his team win and lose to Harvard heading into Saturday’s contest.
“We had a good week of preparation,” junior defenseman Reilly Walsh said. “Honestly, losing to them [on Feb. 21] probably was a really good experience for us... We adjusted in practice and knew we were going to have to beat their forecheck, and I thought we did a really good job of that.”
Around the halfway mark of the first period, Harvard began to really pressure the visitors. After several strong shifts and a powerplay opportunity, the play of an unusual defensive pair — sophomore Jack Rathbone and rookie Jace Foskey — gave the hosts the first goal of the night.
Key keep-ins at the blue line prevented the Saints from clearing the zone, and Foskey teed up a point shot that sophomore Baker Shore redirected behind the net-minder. Foskey’s assist was his first collegiate point.
Another Rathbone play extended Harvard’s lead at the 17th minute of the first frame. The blue-liner threaded a pass to junior forward Henry Bowlby, who had snuck past the St. Lawrence defense. Skating in alone, Bowlby chipped the puck past Mannella for the 2-0 lead.
“I don’t think we gave them as many chances, where we kind of handed them breakaways and outnumbered chances,” coach Donato said. “We managed the puck a little bit better. Obviously making some plays early was helpful, to get the lead. Just to get the positive vibe on the bench is always helpful.”
The first-period action had not come to a close yet, however. At the 18-minute mark, Saints junior co-captain Dylan Woolf was whistled for boarding Harvard junior Jack Badini behind the St. Lawrence net. While Badini was quick to get back on his skates, the referees assessed Woolf a major penalty and a game misconduct — meaning that Harvard would have some powerplay time to end the first as well as to begin the second period.
It didn’t take long for Harvard to find twine on the man advantage. Walsh received a pass in the slot just as the Saints penalty-killers gave way in front of the net, giving Walsh a good look at the goal. His sneaky wrister made its way past Mannella. When the teams left the ice, Harvard found itself with a comfortable three-goal lead.
“We were just a little more ready to go,” said Walsh, comparing Saturday’s start to Friday’s. “I think we knew that we had an opportunity to put the game away in the first period… We saw an opening to get a lead after one [frame] and I thought we...finished some opportunities, unlike yesterday.”
The powerplay wasn’t done scoring yet — and neither was Walsh. In the remaining three minutes of 5-on-4, Harvard continued to hem St. Lawrence in its own zone. A cross-crease feed from sophomore Jack Drury made its way onto Walsh’s stick, and the junior tapped it home. The two-spot is Walsh’s first of this season, and marks his first two-goal game since the 2018-19 season opener.
After Harvard added a fifth goal, courtesy of Drury, the Saints proved they would not go quietly. An interference penalty put the visitors on the powerplay. Towards the end of the two minutes, sophomore forward Kaden Pickering tapped in a feed from senior Alex Gilmour, breaking Harvard net-minder Mitchell Gibson’s shutout bid.
Nevertheless, the rookie goaltender backstopped his team to a 2-0 series victory, turning away all but one of St. Lawrence’s shots. Harvard added two more tallies, from Drury again and rookie John Farinacci, for a comfortable 7-1 lead late in the third.
“I thought [Gibson] looked in control,” coach Donato said. “Last night I thought he played well, but the game was a little bit choppy, defensively, for us... But I thought he was solid tonight and gave us a good effort.”
With two senior goaltenders on the bench, the Harvard coaching staff pulled Gibson so that Cameron Gornet and Sihak Lee could have a few minutes of ice time each in their last home game.
“It was pretty special,” coach Donato said. “[Lee], as a third goalie, maybe doesn’t get as much love and attention as far as playing time, but certainly has a lot of value in the sacrifice he makes to...work with guys... I wanted to make sure that Cam Gornet was in the net, as a senior, at the end of the game. He’s played some very important games for us, he’s been a tremendous teammate.”
If Harvard wants to keep up its streak of Lake Placid appearances, it will have to get through another best-of-three series, however. The team will visit RPI for an ECAC quarterfinal matchup with a score to settle — a loss to the Engineers in the last weekend of the regular season put Harvard out of the running for the conference four-seed and a first-round bye.
“We’re really excited,” said Drury of the second-round matchup. “It’s a good atmosphere at that rink… We know they’re going to be fired up.”
