The femme fatale is an oft depicted image in theater. Alluring and confident, she dominates men with her sexy looks and natural charm. When the women of Greece take this image one step further in “Lysistrata,” using sex as a leveraging tool to stop the fighting of The Peloponnesian War, uproar and hilarity ensue.Two thousand, four hundred years after its original performance in Athens, Aristophanes’ “Lysistrata” is being brought to campus by Harvard’s Classical Club, who both selected and translated the play. Directed by James M. Leaf ’10 and produced by Veronica R. Koven-Matasy ’10, this classical Greek play–which will run from April 16 to 18 at the Loeb Experimental Theatre—is adapted for the modern audience, keeping the sexual lewdness and comedy of the original play.“The play is the translation of a Greek classic with our own interpretations,” says Catherine A. Morris ’11, the costume designer. “It’s supposed to capture the risqué effect it would have had on Greek audiences, because it is shocking—this drama is about a war between men and women, and there is a lot of sexual tension and overt sexual references,” says Morris, who is also a Crimson contributing writer.  “Lysistrata” was chosen, in part, to address the relative scarcity of plays produced on campus that focus on women. “The Classics Club chose the play, because we thought it was time for a play about girls,” Koven-Matasy explains.Following Lysistrata as she leads a sex strike, the play challenges stereotypical gender roles. By placing typically masculine domains, such as sex and war, under the control of the women, they become the empowered protagonists of the story, actively and effectively inducing change. “It destructs the idea of traditional femininity and pares down the stoicism of men,” Morris says.“In ancient times and even now, the women are expected to shut up and sit in the kitchen,” Koven-Matasy says. “There’s this feeling [in the play] that the women have done this for so long that the pressure is building up and building up and that they are miserable with this war.”The use of sexuality to end something as political as war is both enlightening and engaging, providing most of the raunchy humor in the play.“The key phrases for this play are sex and war,” says Vanessa B. Koo ’12, who plays both Lampito, a strong and athletic Spartan woman, and Ismenia. “It’s about women taking control over the situation, and in a way they know how. The men have no choice but to submit.”“Just looking at war and what it does to people is an important theme in the play, including issues of male dominance and senselessness that go behind wars,” Koo adds. “To see that juxtaposed with this lighthearted discussion on sexuality is interesting. I think it’s important to have these things juxtaposed against each other. You see the context of things in relativity and how the two themes fit together.”Because the play explores timeless themes of sexuality, war, and the battle of the sexes, this classical Greek play was adapted fairly easily for the 21st century audience, save for the antiquated and esoteric jokes. “Adaptations have to be made because the play is funny in the original Greek but often only funny to Classicists,” Koven-Matasy says.By changing the language used in the play and having the actors dress in contemporary outfits—mostly their own clothes—the cast and staff hoped that the audience would better understand the play without being bogged down by archaic jargon and references.“We wanted to make something that would make sense to the modern audience and that would relate to them. That’s the most effective way to reinterpret the play,” Koven-Matasy says. “It [the sexual component] is very humorously exaggerated in the play. But really, everyone wants to have sex. The women are just as unhappy as the men, when they have a sex strike. The idea is that whoever has the willpower wins.”By continuing to put on annual productions of classical theatre, the Classical Club hopes that the Harvard community will become more familiar with ancient Greek plays.“The first impression is always that Harvard doesn’t put on classical plays that often, like ancient Greek drama. Ancient Greek drama is the starting point of theater, but we don’t put it on often,” Koven-Matasy says. “We are a community of intellectuals, and we should see where the roots of theater lie. And, themes of anti-war and feminism really do ring true here.”

“History is dead!” shrieks Polly X, Hecuba’s murdered daughter in Professor Christine Evans’ most recent play “Trojan Barbie.” It is a jarring exclamation, but one that is dead on. What is most disquieting about Evans’ “Trojan Barbie” is not the tattered, plastic body parts hanging over the set, but its intense focus on personal suffering rather than a macro-overview of a historical event.“Trojan Barbie”—which had its world premiere at the American Repertory Theatre on Saturday, March 28—follows Lotte, a British doll repair-woman, who goes on vacation in modern Troy. There, she stumbles into calamity, finding herself in an all-female concentration camp where rape is rampant and death, inevitable. At the camp, she meets several broken Trojan women, including Hecuba, who finds her family growing smaller by the hour, and Andromache, who clings desperately to her only immediate family—her son.The play is based upon Euripedes’ “Trojan Women,” a tragedy that traces the lives of four Trojan women awaiting their fates after the fall of Troy and the deaths of their husbands. “Trojan Women” focuses on war’s inhumanities by depicting personal histories and the intimate—almost palpable—pains of its heroines. Like Euripedes’ play, “Trojan Barbie” draws its poignancy from the intimate. Scenes of warfare and violence are hauntingly relatable because of their extra-temporal nature; these hate crimes are timeless and place-less. “Trojan Barbie” presents an un-reality; for example, the play is set in “modern day Troy,” a fictional extension of an ancient city. The travesty of men aggressively raping women in concentration camps—as presented in the play—is an atrocity unattached to a specific time or place. It is almost as though Lotte falls into a rabbit-hole, only to emerge in a wreckage of smoke and mirrors. The reality of the play is disorienting, and solid ground exists only in the characters’ personal sufferings. The eerie presence of dolls furthers this surreal effect. The play flirts shamelessly with the line between doll and human, one that it figures as flexible and thin. Lotte, for example, treats her doll “patients” as though they are real people, and Andromache’s beloved “son” is a large doll. It is interesting that Lotte first recognizes Andromache’s son as a doll but later treats it as a real person. Lotte’s (and the audience’s) intuitive failure to recognize the play’s barbies as real people seems to be a statement about society’s callousness in treating suffering people as plastic objects. Lotte admits that the British media disregards the suffering of Troy’s women to focus on her own “heroic” escape; it is this sort of skewed dehumanization that commits the Trojan victims to doll-hood.Despite its thematic ambiguities, “Trojan Barbie” has a distinct intrinsic rhythm that keeps it moving. Its transitions are marked by a staccato of percussive sounds—lively, yet portentous. A line of lights on a wall in the set also turns rhythmically on and off to further demarcate transitions. As if to the drums of war, the play marches to an internal beat, and its fury of personal devastation crescendos to the climactic shattering of the play’s illusions. The set design under the direction of David Reynoso is precise and meticulous in its details, and most importantly, it works. A string of mutilated doll parts hangs ominously over the milieu of the stage. The rubble of the setting is a constant reminder of war’s devastation. Significantly, this scene of ruin is not specifically Greek or Trojan, modern or ancient. The set instead pays homage to the play’s presentation of personal history.As Evans writes in her Playwright’s Note, “Inside the driest desert is the murmured dream of the sea, and under the Greek poetry that immortalizes sacrificial virgins we can find living girls full of rebellion, botched home-made tattoos, and too-short skirts.” To be sure, the play’s plasticized playthings transcend both time and space to tell a more universal human story.

Ambitious programming, remarkable technical standards, and impeccable artistry have guaranteed the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) a spot on the “Big Five” list of American orchestras for over a century. The iconic performing arts institution, which routinely skims the international arts circuit for Symphony Hall recruits, is not afraid to showcase established artists and promising new talent on the same stage. This past Saturday, music director James Levine hedged a program of eclectic music from four countries on the shoulders of young Korean conductor Shi-Yeon Sung, who recently became one of two assistant conductors of the BSO. Save for an electrifying rendition of Bela Bartok’s suite from “The Miraculous Mandarin,” however, the BSO delivered an unpolished, bland, and thoroughly disappointing performance under Sung’s baton. In her subscription series debut with the BSO, Sung opened with Jean Sibelius’s “The Bard,” a little-known tone poem from the Finnish composer’s “dark period.” The exploratory rubato and ethereal runs in principal harpist Ann Hobson Pilot’s introductory solo were masterfully evocative of Nordic folklore, but a messy ensemble entrance quickly overran her lyrical interpretation. The minimalist dynamic range and bare orchestration of the piece, which should have constructed a spare yet meditative musical texture, only served to render the orchestra’s shortcomings all the more apparent. Rocky tempo changes and halfhearted instrumental solos transformed what might have been an entrancing musical reflection into a painful exercise in the mechanical art of staying together.The Grieg Piano Concerto in A minor fared no better under Sung’s direction and Brazilian pianist Nelson Friere’s touch. Friere, whose command of the keyboard rivaled that of his longtime duo partner and legendary pianist Martha Argerich at the peak of his career, delivered a restrained performance that failed to communicate the rustic, fiercely nationalistic character of Grieg’s music. Friere’s former flair for pairing reckless abandon with nuanced maturity was completely absent from this performance. The attack of the opening octave cascade was overly cautious, and Sung’s uninvolved conducting generated orchestral accompaniment that further quenched any musical excitement. Friere’s rough phrasing of the second movement’s main theme disrupted the chordal harmonies in Grieg’s composition, interrupting the audience’s imagination of the majestic fjords and luscious landscape of the composer’s native Norway. In the third movement, Friere’s accents and staccatos lacked the caustic bite that keeps listeners on edge. He never foraged deep enough into the keyboard to make Grieg’s melodies soar, though the orchestra, which finally reached a fully blended volume near the coda, did manage to salvage the concerto’s explosive conclusion.After Friere’s encore rendition of Gluck’s “Dance of the Blessed Spirits,” which was just as tame as the main performance itself, Sung led the orchestra in the 1945 version of Aaron Copland’s “Appalachian Spring,” a ballet written on commission by dancer/choreographer Martha Graham. While the BSO attacked Copland’s syncopated rhythms with crisp precision and settled upon key symphonic harmonies in layers of perfect intonation, the distinctively optimistic, Americana aura of Copland’s work made only a transient appearance. Sung’s conducting failed to coax a spacious tone from the orchestra, and poorly integrated high string-woodwind dialogues dragged the ensemble into musical stagnation. The orchestra recovered slightly during the piece’s variations on the Shaker theme “Simple Gifts,” which Sung executed with animation and drive.If any piece could have pulled the BSO out of a string of three mediocre performances in one night, it was Hungarian composer Bela Bartok’s Suite from “The Miraculous Mandarin,” a musical vortex of discordant chords and pointed rhythms that the BSO executed with gripping prowess. The orchestra came out in full force, with the string section effortlessly running up and down scales in augmented octaves to the backdrop of frenetic trombone glissandos. The jazzy interlude in the middle of the suite allowed individual soloists to showcase their musical personalities; the principal oboist’s arpeggios were sneaky and playful, while the clarinet soloist’s plaintive phrasing complemented the ebb and flow of Bartok’s meticulously constructed tempo lines. The suite ended in a roar of climactic dissonance that even Sung, whose conservative conducting had constricted the other pieces, could not help but encourage. The BSO’s take on Bartok was proof of the artistic talent of each BSO member and their collective caliber as an ensemble. One just wonders why it took three pieces for this top-notch orchestra to warm up and start playing.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, Registrar Barry S. Kane announced that students who complete their Q evaluations online will be able to access their final grades immediately after the end of the examination period instead of having to wait the usual 10 days. The end-of-semester evaluations, which are mandatory for all but the smallest seminar courses, are an important part of both teaching and learning here at the College, and it is essential that students fill them out. Therefore, we applaud the Registrar for implementing this new system and hope that it is an efficient and effective means of incentivizing the completion of these critical evaluations. While students here at the College often fret about their grades, it is important to remember that faculty and teaching fellows also welcome feedback. Indeed, it is a critical component of improving the quality of teaching here at Harvard, especially in departments where large classes are common, like economics and government. As such, we view this new system as a much-needed method of improving student participation rates, which have been less than optimal for many classes (including both huge lecture courses and small seminars).In particular, we hope that, by providing a powerful incentive to those students who are most concerned for their grade in a class, professors and other teaching staff will be able to receive feedback from a wider range of students, including those who may not have been as enthusiastic about the course as their peers. Increased participation by the student body should be able to provide a clearer picture of what a class actually entails. Indeed, many courses in this year’s Q Guide had rather incomplete evaluations as a result of low participation rates.We also hope that the new policy is a sign of things to come. In the past, many students have expressed frustration with the Registrar for its overly bureaucratic and arbitrary methods, especially the 10-day waiting period to receive final grades. This policy was especially frustrating to second-semester freshmen, sophomores, and juniors hoping to apply for internships and fellowships with deadlines in late May. As such, we are impressed with the Registrar’s new flexibility and hope that it will continue to take student feedback into consideration.

This week, a panel of Harvard ROTC students and a student protest against Harvard’s refusal to officially recognize ROTC reminded the campus of Harvard’s troubled relationship with the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps. During the Vietnam War, Harvard banned ROTC from campus and continues to impede student participation because of the military’s “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy enacted in 1993. Because openly gay and lesbian students are excluded from ROTC under this policy, the University says that its refusal to recognize ROTC on campus is in line with its policies against discrimination outlined in the student handbook.
The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy currently enforced by the military does amount to discrimination. It bars some of those who wish to serve their country from doing so, and the Congress should take immediate steps to repeal it. Consequently, although ROTC cadets themselves do not shape military-recruitment policies, we support Harvard’s refusal to officially recognize ROTC, just as it would refuse to recognize any other organization on campus that denied membership to open homosexuals. This policy is not only in line with the standards set forth in the student handbook, but it also matches with the philosophy of openness and inclusion that the University must preserve.
With that said, opposition to DADT should not be conflated with resistance to ROTC and the students that serve in it. The sacrifices made by students who travel to MIT on a regular basis to participate in training should be recognized and valued. They demonstrate a commitment to service that should be admired and followed by the rest of the student body. Because of this, the University can and should take several basic steps to facilitate the choices of these students who wish to serve.
The Harvard Republican Club’s awareness week makes several reasonable requests of Harvard. First, the University should make it easier for ROTC students to cross-register at MIT by covering cross-registration fees and allowing military-science courses to appear on transcripts. Harvard should also improve financial-aid policy so that ROTC grants do not preclude students from receiving Harvard funds.
ROTC is an important and worthwhile program, disregarding the discriminatory practice of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” The program provides clear benefits for the military and the nation and allows Harvard students to serve and shape the future of the U.S. military. Currently, the extracurricular atmosphere at Harvard offers many chances to serve the community in different ways, and an ethic of service could and should grow here.
As a university, Harvard has historically highly valued military service. Memorial Church and Memorial Hall stand as looming examples of our commitment to memorialize those who have sacrificed greatly in military duty. President Obama should fulfill his promise of eliminating “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.” When he does, Harvard can once again fully embrace the ethic of military service and the ROTC program.

For all its hullabaloo about green being the new crimson, Harvard is not nearly as green as we’d like to think. Sure, we occasionally eat trayless lunches in the dining hall or hold events with fancy banners promoting sustainability and speeches by the likes of Al Gore ’69. At times, the rhetoric can even come off as something out of the show Captain Planet: we claim to reduce carbon emissions and conserve energy, all to save the earth. Yet our efforts to be heroic often come up short.
Take, for instance, the matter of laundry. With over 6,000 undergraduates, Harvard students have a lot of clothes to wash. If each student does laundry once a week—and this is assuming only one load of laundry—that’s over 180,000 loads per academic year. Not only is that a lot of water, it’s also a lot of laundry detergent—over 280,000 ounces of liquid detergent, to be precise, given that the detergent of choice is doubly concentrated. Unfortunately, most of this laundry detergent, due to its chemical content, is extremely harmful for our beloved earth. 
Almost every time I walk between Boylston and Wigglesworth Hall, I get a whiff of the heavenly scent of laundry, the familiar and comforting smell of Tide Original Scent and Downy. My pleasure in this perfume is momentary, however, as I remember that the source of this pleasant olfactory experience is harming the environment and my fellow citizens. 
So what does that mean for those of us who care about the earth but would prefer not to smell like it? Luckily, eco-friendly detergents exist that are just as effective at cleaning clothes as their brand-name counterparts. According to the “Did You Know?” section of the label on vegetable-based detergent Seventh Generation, “If every household in the U.S. replaced just one bottle of 100 oz. 2x ultra petroleum-based liquid laundry detergent with our 100 oz. 2x ultra vegetable-based product, we could save 460,000 barrels of oil—enough to heat and cool 27,000 U.S. homes for a year!” 
Using eco-friendly detergent kills two birds with one stone: saving the environment and wasting less money on oil. So why don’t more of us use eco-friendly detergent?
The answer seems to lie in product availability and accessibility. It’s difficult to find Seventh Generation—or any other eco-friendly brand, like Mrs. Meyers or Biokleen—in the immediate vicinity of the Square. In a laundry emergency, the only option is to run to CVS and grab the nearest brand, which tends not to be a bottle of earth-friendly vegetable derivatives. Moreover, eco-friendly detergents tend to be more expensive than generic detergents like Tide. At the least, a stigma exists amongst the student body surrounding such “organic” products, which are perceived as a rip-off.
If Harvard is to remain true to its mission to go green, it ought to provide students with these eco-friendly detergents at lowered prices and encourage student use of biodegradable products in the laundry rooms. Perhaps a detergent vending machine would be a feasible idea. With easy access to environmentally friendly products, students might begin to think about what they pour into the laundry machines every week.
Whatever the solution, the time to act is now. With Steven Chu, the U.S. secretary of energy, speaking at the upcoming Commencement ceremonies, Harvard should ensure that we are green in as many aspects as possible. After all, we wouldn’t want to disappoint Steven Chu. But, more importantly, we wouldn’t want to disappoint the earth. 
Harvard, it’s time to give up Tide. It’s   time for a new generation—the Seventh Generation.Ayse Baybars ’12, a Crimson editorial writer, lives in Wigglesworth Hall.

It’s never easy to go to a rival’s field with everything to lose and pull out a victory. But on Saturday, that’s exactly what the Harvard softball team did—twice.The Crimson traveled to Hanover, N.H. to take on Dartmouth in the first half of a crucial home-and-home series to decide the Ivy League North title. In front of a raucous Big Green crowd at Sachem Field, Harvard swept the twinbill, mounting a sixth-inning rally in each game to win by scores of 7-3 and 6-3, respectively.Freshman pitcher Rachel Brown anchored the Crimson once more, hurling a complete game in the first contest before coming in to save the nightcap. “We went to Dartmouth with a goal to put ourselves in a really good position for [Sunday], and that’s exactly what we did,” co-captain Hayley Bock said. “Mission accomplished.”HARVARD 6, DARTMOUTH 3For the second time in as many games, Harvard found itself trailing heading into the top of the sixth. This time, it was junior Melissa Schellberg who came up with the big hit, blasting a 2-RBI double to left center.Freshman Whitney Shaw reached on base after being hit by a pitch, and an infield single off the bat of junior Jen Francis induced an error that sent Shaw to third. Francis stole second to set the stage for Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor. After Schellberg cleared the bases, Bock brought her home on a single up the middle, putting the Crimson up for good, 4-3. “We stayed really focused and, if anything, we were more fired up for the second game, knowing that the other team’s going to come out wanting revenge,” Bock said. Dartmouth got on the scoreboard first, putting up three runs in the bottom of the fourth inning. Harvard junior starter Margaux Black got into a one-out jam after allowing two consecutive singles to start the inning, yielding to classmate Dana Roberts with runners on second and third. Roberts allowed a three-run shot to junior Christy Autin, the first batter she faced, and then gave up two more singles before pitching out of trouble to limit the Big Green’s lead to 3-0. The Crimson tacked on an unearned run in the top of the fifth, when Bock, who had reached on a fielder’s choice, came around to score on an error by Dartmouth third baseman Ashley Gleason, who had five errors on the afternoon.After Harvard took the lead in the top of the sixth, Roberts got into trouble in the bottom of the frame, putting runners on first and third with one out.Brown got the call, and came in to get two quick outs and escape the jam.“I got a chance to fill a role, and if any other pitcher was coming in in that situation, I’d want them to pick me up,” Brown said. “Dana had pitched really well, and I wanted to get out of the jam for her and the rest of the team.”The Crimson iced it in the top of the seventh, with Shaw blasting an RBI double to center field and Francis following up with an RBI single of her own, making the score 6-3.HARVARD 7, DARTMOUTH 3Brown once again stole the show in the opener, pitching her 14th complete game of the season for an eight-hit victory. But it was her routine first-inning strikeout of the Big Green’s Nikki Yee that put Brown in the Harvard record books, setting a new single-season benchmark for strikeouts. She finished the day with 10 on the afternoon and 192 on the season.“It’s an awesome feeling, but I think it’s definitely overshadowed by what the team’s doing, and I think that’s the way it should be,” Brown said. Brown was solid all the way through, despite getting touched for two runs in the bottom of the third on back-to-back doubles by Yee and junior Kirsten Costello. But she got a lift from her offense in the top of the sixth.Three consecutive errors from Dartmouth’s Gleason at third base scored Bock and put sophomore Emily Henderson and co-captain Bailey Vertovez on second and third. With one out, sophomore Ellen Macadam launched a ball over the left-field fence for a three-run homer.Francis followed with a solo shot to turn the Crimson’s 2-1 deficit into a 6-2 lead. “We were hitting the ball, and when we weren’t hitting, we weren’t getting frustrated,” Brown said. “The batters were trying to make adjustments. They stayed calm, didn’t really press too hard, stayed relaxed, and were able to have some big hits.”The Big Green got within three on a sixth-inning homer from freshman Molly Khalil, but Harvard added some insurance in the top of the seventh, with Henderson singling and coming around on yet another error from the Dartmouth third baseman for the 7-3 win.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

Amidst shouts of “winds of change” and “sixth-inning magic” from the crowd, the Harvard softball team attempted to stage a late comeback in Game 2 of its doubleheader against Dartmouth at Soldiers Field yesterday.After sweeping the Big Green in Hanover on Saturday, the Crimson needed to win just one of yesterday’s two games to claim the Ivy League North Division championship.But while Harvard (27-16, 12-8 Ivy) managed to score two runs, its efforts were simply too little, too late, as the Big Green’s defense held fast to end both the game, 5-2, and the Crimson’s two-year reign atop the North Division.  The defeat came after a 4-0 shutout loss to Dartmouth earlier in the afternoon.“In the second game, we started making a comeback in the later innings,” freshman pitcher Rachel Brown said.  “I really thought we were going to pull it out, and we’re obviously disappointed that we didn’t.”Brown, who started Game 1 and pitched in relief in the second, finished the day with 11 strikeouts. Her season total of 203 strikeouts far surpasses the previous all-time single season strikeout record of 182 to make her the first pitcher in Harvard history to pass the 200-strikeout mark.DARTMOUTH 5, HARVARD 2While the Big Green managed to score twice at the top of the second and build on its lead throughout the game, the Crimson nonetheless had its own opportunities to score.Its best attempt came at the bottom of the second when a fielding error by a Dartmouth outfielder allowed freshman first baseman Whitney Shaw to reach second. Following a hit up the middle from junior outfielder Jen Francis and with Harvard coach Jenny Allard furiously winding her arm to indicate she should continue running, Shaw dove for home plate and was just narrowly tagged out to end the frame.The Big Green managed to score three more times—twice in the third inning and once in the sixth—to augment its lead. Brown pitched the final four innings for the Crimson, allowing just two hits and one run in her attempt to counter Dartmouth’s momentum.  “I really went in there thinking that I was pitching for the team,” Brown said.  “We needed to hold them scoreless so that we could come back and score. ”Brown was able to inspire a comeback for Harvard, though it ultimately came too late. Shaw got the action going with a double to right center and junior third baseman Melissa Schellberg, who is also a Crimson sports editor, brought her home with a double of her own that glanced over the head of Dartmouth’s third baseman.Schellberg made it to third when the Big Green’s catcher failed to control a wild pitch and made it home off a single by Francis to make the score 5-2.“The team thrives on momentum and once we started getting going, I think everyone knew in their heads that we could continue scoring,” Brown said.  “Unfortunately, [Dartmouth] had some things work out for them and…things just didn’t really fall into place for us.”DARTMOUTH 2, HARVARD 0Strong pitching from Dartmouth made the difference in tension-filled Game 1 as Big Green pitcher Hillary Barker allowed four hits and no runs in her seven innings of work.Brown, who pitched the first four innings before being relieved by junior Margaux Black, did not allow a single hit in her first three innings.  But an error by Shaw in the fourth allowed a runner to reach first base. A well-executed bunt combined with a single quickly loaded the bases for Dartmouth.  A single up the middle by the Big Green’s Alyssa Parker brought home the only two runs of the  game.Dartmouth looked to threaten later in the inning with runners on second and third and just one out. But a strikeout by Brown and an out at first defused a potentially dangerous situation for the Crimson. Despite the strong defensive play, Harvard just couldn’t come up with enough offense to answer the Big Green’s runs.   “In the first game, our hits weren’t there—we weren’t stringing them together and that definitely showed in the score,” Shaw said.—Staff writer Lucy D. Chen can be reached at lucychen@fas.harvard.edu.

On a beautiful Saturday evening, fans of Harvard football got their first look at next fall’s edition of the Crimson in the annual intra-squad spring game at Harvard Stadium. Unsurprisingly, the first unit, dressed in crimson, demolished its white counterparts in a 42-14 rout. “We weren’t going one versus one,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “If it was one versus one, it could have been a pretty boring spring game. This was for recruits, this was for the scoreboard, this was for whatever fans we had up there.”The game offered few answers for the Crimson’s most burning off-season question—who will step into senior Chris Pizzotti’s shoes as starting quarterback? Sophomores Collier Winters and Matt Simpson saw most of the playing time, with Winters helming the first unit’s offense and Simpson working primarily with the second unit. Winters came away with the better stat line, completing 21-of-40 attempts for 201 yards and a touchdown. He also took the ball himself on several carries, including a 12-yard run for a touchdown late in the first half. Simpson finished 9-of-22 with 74 yards and a touchdown, coming on a pass to junior Alex Math as time expired in the first quarter.Though filling the void Pizzotti left behind will be a difficult task, Murphy has faith that the two sophomores can run the offense.“We’ve got about 28 practices before we play Holy Cross, and they’re going to need every one of them for us to make a decision, and every one of them for them to be ready to play,” Murphy said. “It’s not going to be like it was the last two years, with such veteran quarterbacks, with Chris Pizzotti. On the other hand, both kids are more Liam [O’Hagan]-like in that they’re very athletic guys, they’re guys that can beat you with their feet.”Winters and Simpson both suffered from the absence of the headliners of Harvard’s receiving corps. “I think we’re a little bit handicapped in the spring by not having guys like Matt Luft, Chris Lorditch, Mike Cook, Levi Richards—those guys make you a better player,” Murphy said. “Automatically, they step onto the field and things are easier.”In the absence of the junior standouts, sophomore Marco Iannuzzi was the Crimson’s most consistent receiver, finishing the evening with nine catches for 69 yards and a touchdown, coming on a seven-yard pass from Winters on the first series of the game.Freshman Adam Chrissis and sophomore Demetrius Gadson hauled in five catches apiece, with Gadson also making noise on the ground, running for 26 yards and a touchdown.Junior Cheng Ho had an excellent first half on the ground, rushing for 113 yards and two touchdowns before sitting out most of the second half to allow others the opportunity to play. Junior Ben Jenkins and sophomore Gino Gordon, Harvard’s other two starting running backs, sat out the game.Juniors James Williams and Alex Spisak will return to anchor the offensive line, though with Spisak sitting out most of the game, Harvard ran into some trouble at center.There were several botched snaps, including one that Simpson recovered for a 17-yard loss and another that Ho turned into a touchdown.Winters batted the ball onto the ground in front of Ho in an attempt to prevent the rogue snap from falling behind him, and Ho recovered it and found space in the middle to run it 27 yards into the endzone.“Alex Spisak I think is literally a potential All-American—he didn’t play much tonight,” Murphy said. “He was a little bit dinged up and we took out some of the guys who have literally nothing to prove…The depth at center is a big concern, but in terms of the front line, he’s as good as anybody in our league.”On the defensive side of the ball, junior Sean Hayes led the way with eight tackles. Hayes had been a contributor in his first two seasons before being sidelined with an injury, and will lead a new wave of Crimson linebackers.“Conor Murphy, Sean Hayes, Jon Takamura, Nick Hasselberg, those guys can play, and the nice thing is we aren’t playing sophomores, we’re playing seniors,” Murphy said. “They’ve been on a couple really quality football teams, they’re hungry, they’ve got a little bit of a chip on their shoulder.”Jake Dombrowski, a recruited punter from Gaylord, Mich. is one freshman who could compete immediately for playing time. With a solid crop of homegrown talent rising up, Murphy’s not counting on his incoming class to fill any immediate holes.“Overall, I guess we’re a lot like a lot of Ivy teams,” Murphy said. “We have a chance to be a pretty decent team, but we’ve got a long way to go and a lot to prove.—Staff writer Kate Leist can be reached at kleist@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Saturday, amid all the pageantry of Harvard-Yale, Senior Day, and Spring Weekend, the men’s lacrosse team looked to accomplish something it had not achieved since 2004: a winning season. In its final game at Harvard Stadium this year, the Crimson (7-5, 2-3 Ivy) led the Bulldogs (5-7, 1-5 Ivy) throughout the contest and pulled away late, winning, 13-8, and ensuring a record over .500.“It was just a great win,” captain Max Mottschwiller said. “We needed to get this one for a lot of reasons, for the season and for the seniors.”The offense was led by freshman attacker Jeff Cohen. After a career-best six goals last week against Holy Cross, Cohen tallied five scores, including the eventual game-winner. Senior goaltender Joe Pike anchored the defense with five saves on the afternoon.“It’s a rivalry game, Harvard-Yale, a great atmosphere, a ton of people here, it’s just great to come out with a win,” Cohen said.The scoring began 35 seconds into the game when senior midfielder Sean Whitsitt sent a pass to senior defenseman Eric Posner in the middle of the field. The long stickman bounced a shot past Yale goaltender Johnathan Falcone, Posner’s second goal of the season, to give Harvard an early lead.“Eric Posner was everywhere today,” Harvard coach John Tillman said. “He played with so much heart and toughness.”The Crimson offense stalled for the rest of the opening period. The Bulldogs tied the score four minutes after Posner’s goal and took a 2-1 lead with 3:55 left in the quarter.Harvard responded early in the second period when freshman attacker Kevin Vaughn scored an unassisted goal. Two minutes later, junior midfielder Jason Duboe set Cohen up with a beautiful pass in front of the net where the freshman converted for his first goal of the afternoon.Cohen struck again midway through the period. Posner fed the freshman beside the net and Cohen faked a shot low and finished high to give the Crimson a 4-2 lead.Yale fought back, tallying two goals in the latter half of the period. One score came after a blocked shot trickled away from Pike and was recovered and scored by Bulldog attacker Brendan Gibson. Another Cohen goal accounted for Harvard’s fifth of the half, but Yale was able to bring the score back to within one in the closing seconds of the period. Cradling the ball behind the goal with time dwindling, Yale attacker Matt Gibson ran in front of the net and converted on a diving shot.Leading 5-4 at halftime, the Crimson held a wide edge in faceoffs, 9-2, a slight advantage in shots, 20-19, and was tied with the Bulldogs in groundballs, 11-11.Harvard came out strong in the second half, scoring three goals in the first four minutes. One minute into the third period, Motschwiller drove past his defender on the left wing and scored on a diving shot for his ninth of the season.“It’s good to put one in, but the win is the most important thing because we can enjoy that as a team,” Motschwiller said.Less than two minutes after Motschwiller’s goal, junior attacker Jesse Fehr scored off of a rebound and, one minute later, Duboe ripped a shot past Falcone to give Harvard a four-goal cushion. Yale cut the lead to two twice, but the Crimson attack was too great to overcome. Fehr and Duboe each added another goal, captain Nick Smith scored one, and Cohen tallied two more, notching his 31st goal of the season.“[Cohen] is a very good finisher,” Tillman said. “When he makes a mistake or a goalie makes a save, he does a great job of analyzing and going, ‘You know what, I need to try to do this,’ or ‘This is what I can do to improve.’”The win was Harvard’s seventh on the season and ensures the senior class of the first winning season during its tenure.“Our seniors are great role models to all of us,” Cohen said. “They’ve really started something for this program. It’s the first winning season Harvard’s had in a while, and it’s big for them. They started this, and we wanted to come out here and make them proud.”—Staff writer Timothy J.

After a rocky Ivy League season that the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (5-10, 2-5 Ivy) finished with a bang this weekend, powering over No. 20 Cornell (9-6, 3-4), 11-7.  This contest snapped Harvard’s five-game losing streak.“Overall, the game was great,” senior attacker Kaitlin Martin said.  “It was the first time in my four years that we beat Cornell.  It was amazing to finish the Ivy season with the win.”After an early tally from sophomore Jess Halpern, the Big Red came back to score two back-to-back goals to take a 2-1 lead.Before long, Halpern put another two goals in the back of the net, recording her 11th hat trick of the season.After Cornell tied the score back up at three, the Crimson rallied to gain a five-goal lead with a little more then 12 minutes remaining in the first half.Junior tri-captain Sara Flood added two goals for Harvard, while captain Shannon Flynn, freshman Tyler Petropulos, and Martin each notched a tally in the five-goal streak.  Halpern and freshman Katie Doherty each recorded an assist over the course of Harvard’s run, while the other three goals were unassisted.But the Big Red answered right back, dominating the last 10 minutes of the half and coming within one goal of Harvard.  The half ended with a score of 8-7, which would be the closest Cornell would get to the Crimson for the rest if the game.“We took an early lead, but Cornell chipped away at us,” Flood said.  “At halftime, we just wanted to get back out on the field.  We came out and tried to win every 50-50 ball.”The Big Red could touch the back of the net for the rest of the game.  Sophomore Katherine Martino kept the Crimson alive, holding Cornell to only seven goals and recording eight saves.“Kate Martino had some huge saves that kept us in the game,” Martin said.It was not only the goaltending that held the Big Red scoreless in the second half.  The Crimson defense kept Cornell tame throughout the entire game, only allowing 15 shots through all 60 minutes.“At one point, [defenders] Delia Pais and Ellen Gleason had an unbelievable double team which really stuck out,” Flood said.  “The defense had a lot of pressure on them all game, and they handled it well.”Pais and Gleason also tallied two ground balls each.The Big Red’s attacking threat, Libby Johnson, was held to only one goal in the match.While Cornell’s offense was stagnant, Harvard managed to tally another three goals to bring the final score to 11-7.  Halpern and Martin paired up to score another two goals, while Doherty capped it off for the Crimson, scoring her first goal of the game and 15th of the season.“Everything went really well, and everything seemed to come together,” Flood said.  “Everyone did their job.  It started with the goaltending and the motivation just trickled down.”Harvard now leads the all-time series, 20-10, but of the past 11 meetings, Cornell has been victorious in 10.  In their meeting last year, Martin scored four of the Crimson’s nine goals in a 12-9 loss.Halpern and Martin still top the charts in goals for the season. Halpern sits at 44, with Martin right behind her at 37.Harvard looks for another victory next Thursday, as it takes on local rival Boston College.  The game will be in Chestnut Hill at 4:30 and will wrap up the season for the Crimson.“BC is always a good game for us,” Martin said. “We will prepare for this game like any other game, by focusing on the little things.  If we do that, we should end our season well.”

One of the hardest things to do in sports is defend a championship, but the Harvard women’s golf team managed to make it look easy, winning seven of eight tournaments this season and placing second in the other.The latest and greatest victory came this weekend in the Ivy League Championships at Atlantic City Country Club in Northfield, N.J., where the Crimson held off a final-round charge by Yale to win by two strokes and claim the league title for the second year in a row.“Yale played fantastic today,” Harvard coach Kevin Rhoads said. “It did end up getting really close, but we did our job.”Four Crimson golfers made it into the top-10, led by third-place individual finisher junior Claire Sheldon, who shot a third-round 75 to finish nine-over par for the 54-hole three-day tournament. Senior Emily Balmert, freshman Christine Cho, and senior Ali Bode all joined her in the top-10.Harvard jumped out to an early lead Friday and Saturday, as its first-round score of 306 and second-round 295 were both tops in the seven-squad field.“We really stressed the importance of playing a complete 18 holes and not getting too concerned with any one hole at any stage in a round,” Rhoads said. “We just stayed patient and played great on the back, which I thought was a harder nine.”Holding an eight-stroke lead over the Bulldogs heading into the last day, the team made a decision to play more conservatively on the course’s first hole in order to protect its comfortable position on the scoreboard.“We just decided to avoid the bunkers at all costs—even if it meant risking the birdie shot—to protect par,” Balmert said.The Crimson was well-aware that victory was not yet assured, despite the sizeable margin.“Eight strokes, when there are four or five scores counting, is not that much at all,” Balmert said. “We all knew that we had to play our best, and we couldn’t count on a cushion going into the last day.”Those thoughts proved prophetic, as Yale got out to a great start Sunday and began steadily cutting the Harvard lead hole-by-hole. By the 13th green, the two rivals were tied.But Sheldon, who also had an excellent second round score of 73, was clutch down the stretch as a member of the last playing group.“I saw our coach more than I usually do, so I had the feeling that it was pretty close,” Sheldon said.Amidst a flurry of pars, the par-3 17th hole proved to be the difference-maker—Sheldon’s birdie combined with a Yale golfer’s bogey  to separate the two teams for good.“[On the 17th hole] you can’t go over the green, because you’ll have a tough chip coming back, so club selection is really key,” Sheldon said. “I chose a six-iron today…and I hit it awesome—a little too aggressive, but it worked out beautifully. It was less than two feet from the hole. It was certainly a confidence-booster going into 18.”Not far behind Sheldon were the Crimson’s go-to veteran and rookie combo, Balmert and Cho, who tied for fourth overall at10 over par.The seasoned Balmert was a model of consistency, shooting three, four, and three strokes over par in her three rounds. Having played the course in the championship last year, she had a few back-nine difficulties early but averaged only two bogeys for the next two rounds.“It was pretty familiar turf,” Balmert said. “Today, I was pretty level-headed and played consistent golf. I tried to make the course as easy as possible by staying out of trouble.”Cho, the newly-crowned Ivy League rookie of the year, took a more dramatic approach, accumulating 10 bogeys in her opening round.“For some reason I didn’t really feel warmed up with my game in general, and I made a lot of stupid mistakes,” Cho said.But she quickly adjusted and found her rhythm, and her even-par 72 in the second round was the team’s best round of the tournament. “The first round, I made a lot of mistakes with my approach shots, so the second round I was able to not make the same mistakes,” Cho said. Leading the team early on with a first-round score of 74, Bode rounded out the top 10, finishing 16 strokes over par. Sophomore Mia Kabasakalis was three strokes behind in a tie for 14th place.The victory continues the growth of the Harvard women’s golf program, which has steadily improved ever since coach Rhoads’ hiring five seasons ago.“I love where the program is headed,” Balmert said. “The director of golf has a very strong vision for our team, and our coach is absolutely amazing.”—Staff writer Dennis J.

After showing promise amidst the Ivy field at the Yale Opener two weekends ago and at last weekend’s Princeton Invitational, Harvard men’s golf had high hopes heading into this weekend’s Ivy Championships. But those hopes will have to wait another year, as the Crimson finished sixth, just ahead of Brown and Cornell.“Very disappointing,” freshman Mark Pollak said. “We just had to show up with our game and we didn’t. The other teams did. We’re as good a team as any team out there. But they showed up when they had to.”Harvard had faced Yale three times earlier this season—finishing behind the Bulldogs at the GEICO Intercollegiate, edging them at the Spring Opener in New Haven, and finishing behind them at the Princeton Invitational. At the Yale Spring Opener, where Ivy foe Dartmouth was also present, the Crimson placed first overall. In the Princeton Invitational last weekend, Harvard finished eighth behind Yale, Penn, Columbia, and Princeton, but the Crimson was not playing with its regular squad. But with this weekend’s play, Harvard collectively finished +28, behind the Lions’ +10, the Quakers’ +11, the Big Green’s +16, the Bulldogs’ +18, and the Tigers’ +24.“We were a good enough team to compete and we didn’t,” junior Greg Shuman said. “We didn’t play well for three days. We can make all the excuses we want, but at the end of the day, we lost.”But according to Pollak, the hardest part of the weekend’s tournament was sizing up the course. The par-70 Atlantic City Country Club in Northfield, N.J. averages a little over 350 yards per hole and just 93 yards per stroke. For the big hitting Harvard golfers, this didn’t allow them to get some room with monster drives.“It wasn’t a type of course that suited the type of team we have,” Pollak said. “It rewarded bad drives. You could hit it anywhere.”Also, the first round of play was delayed about half an hour, due to windy conditions, and the later tee times knocked everyone a little out of rhythm, but the conditions on Saturday and Sunday posed no problems for the Crimson.“The conditions were perfect,” Pollak said. “The first day was a little unlucky with the late tee times. Ideal golfing weather.”Shuman led the Crimson at +4, good enough for a share of eighth place overall. After shooting a flat par in the first day’s round of play, Shuman dropped slightly in Round 2, shooting a 73, and then slipped further with his +1 round on Day 3. “It was frustrating, because I played a lot better than I scored,” Shuman said. “I was playing really well, but didn’t really have much to show for it. Everyday I got off to great starts, but then had a tough time on the back nine.”Pollak echoed Shuman’s sentiments about his own rounds of play.“I played a lot better than my scores,” Pollak said. “I was out of it initially in the first round. I didn’t have my long -term goggles on and put myself out of it in the first day. It was hard to get any momentum going after that.”Pollak shot a 76 in Friday’s first round, and though he bounced back with a 70 on Saturday and 71 yesterday, he had to settle for a +7 finish, good for sole possession of 13th place.Junior Danny Mayer finished at +8, finishing strong with a 71 in the final round of play yesterday. His total score of 218 gave him a share of 14th place overall.Seniors John Christensen and captain Mike Shore rounded out the Crimson competitors. Shore shot +21 on the weekend, good for 36th, while Christensen shave strokes off each of his previous days finishes, ultimately finishing at +24 at the 37th spot. —Staff writer Dixon McPhillips can be reached at fmcphill@fas.harvard.edu.

With many collegiate sports, allocation of playing time poses a difficulty—balancing quality performers with those who need to gain experience. Fortunately for the Harvard track and field team, the spring season offers a plethora of open lanes. The Crimson kept a busy schedule this past weekend, sending competitors to the Penn Relays on Thursday, the Drake Relays Friday and Saturday, and the UMass Preconference Meet Saturday. Numerous members of the squad were able to compete.“We tried to get each athlete into competition to best prepare for Heps,” Harvard coach Jason Saretsky said.But, the head coach also recognized the chance for less heralded Crimson to get onto the track.“Especially at UMass, that might be [some athletes’] last meet getting an opportunity to compete,” Saretsky said. “It was good to see some athletes on our team getting after it.”While many members of Harvard’s squad had strong showings on the weekend, junior Chas Gillespie led the pack with a fifth-place showing in the college men’s 5000-meter at Penn, posting a 14:01.99—the fourth fastest time in Crimson history and good enough for an NCAA regional qualifier.Gillespie’s tremendous effort marked an uplifting weekend for the Harvard men and women, as the squad readies itself to finish the season at Heptagonals in two weeks.“I think [that race] gives me some confidence, and it gives my teammates confidence as well,” Gillespie said. “We’re all making strides and are ready to compete against the best in the Ivy League.”UMASS PRECONFERENCE MEETThe bulk of the Crimson traveled to Amherst on Saturday to compete in a field of New England squads. With many of the team’s top competitors missing in action, Harvard nonetheless notched quality efforts on both sides.The Crimson women dominated the distance events, as juniors Caitlin Clifford and Stacy Carlson took the 1500- and 5000-meter, respectively, with times of 4:39.70 and 18:01.39. Senior Jan Ng and junior Brenda Cohen finished second and third in the women’s 800-meter—a race in which all five Harvard competitors finished in the top 16—and sophomore Cara Sprague earned third in the 3000-meter steeple chase.The Crimson’s sprinters were no less impressive, as seniors Dara Wilson and Geneva Trotter went one-two in the 100 hurdles.With third place finishes from senior Evan Favermann in the javelin and freshman Lauren Barber in the shotput, as well as a second place effort from high jumper Dina Emde, Harvard tallied a total of 112 points en route to a fourth-place finish.The men’s team enjoyed less success at UMass, although sophomore Sean Gil took the pole vault with a jump of 4.65 meters. Junior Jack Brady notched a third place finish in the hammer throw, but Harvard could not stave off an eighth-place finish, topping only University of Hartford.DRAKE RELAYSSharing the Des Moines, Iowa track at Drake University with professional athletes, the Crimson held its own with strong individual showings.Freshman Nico Weiler had the best effort on the men’s side, breaking his own Harvard record and earning second place in the pole vault with a jump of 5.30 meters. The distance medley team finished 13th for the top Harvard relay showing, with senior Derek Jones, sophomore Dan Chenoweth, and freshmen Darcy Wilson and Brian Paison completing the event in 10:00.78.The women also challenged themselves against excellent competition and watched a few relay teams excel. The 4x1600 team of sophomores Claire Richardson, Hilary May, and Jamie Olson, along with rookie Nicole Cochran, crossed the line in fourth, drawing praise from Saretsky.“The women’s 1600 did a really great job,” he said. “It was fun watching them beat Stanford, a traditional powerhouse.”Harvard bested the Cardinal by .53 seconds, finishing in 19:36.51.Richardson, Olson, and Cochran also combined with freshman Shannon Conway to finish sixth in the distance medley, setting a new school record of 11:40.24.PENN RELAYSThe Crimson sent only three competitors to the elite competition in Philadelphia, but Gillespie made the trip count, posting a personal best to qualify for regionals. The junior was only three seconds behind the event’s top finisher, demonstrating the quality of his effort.“It was pretty amazing,” Gillespie said. “I’m just really happy...[The personal best] was a bit of a surprise, but training has been going well, and I have a lot of faith in the program.”Freshmen Stephen Couch and Kailyn Kuzmuk also competed in their respective 5000 events, finishing 37th and 27th. Kuzmuk’s time of 17:29.27 proved good enough for 14th among collegiate runners.—Staff writer Max N. Brondfield can be reached at mbrondf@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
From time to time, every team must admit the cliché, but inevitable mantra: “There’s always next season.”
Last Monday was not one of those times for the Harvard women’s water polo team (11-16, 4-6 CPWA North).
Squeaking into the Eastern Championships at the eighth seed after finishing third in its division, the Crimson beat out other fringe teams and received the invite to play on home turf against top seeded No. 14 Hartwick as part of a three-game tournament. 
As with two previous confrontations between the teams, the Crimson found itself in troubled waters against the Hawks and witnessed yet again why Hartwick (27-11, 9-1) was considered top-notch in the Northern Division as well as the championship bracket.


After dropping the 16-3 decision to the Hawks, the Crimson found itself in another hole at Blodgett against No. 16 Indiana (21-16, 8-2 CPWA West). But despite a six-goal rampage in the fourth period, Harvard could not close the gap and lost 9-7.
In the battle for seventh place in the tournament against Bucknell (18-17, 5-3 CPWA South), there would be no late-game hole for the Crimson. But there would be a neck-and-neck battle to the finish—a battle that a freshmen-led Harvard squad would win this time, 9-8.
“It was a really important, critical growth point for the team,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said. “It’s a young team. It’s a continuing process of learning how to win...Winning this game, you not only want to win it for your seniors, but you’re in your home pool.”
The win capped off the weekend and the 2009 campaign on a high note. Although seventh may not be ideal, there’s always next season.
HARVARD 9, BUCKNELL 8
On the final day of the tournament, the Crimson came out with a chip on its shoulder. Relying on a multi-faceted offense that featured tallies from seven different players, Harvard jumped out to an early lead it would not relinquish. The Bison threatened several times, but consistent, scrappy play—especially from the team’s freshmen—halted any chance of another heartbreak Sunday morning.
Harvard’s seniors made solid contributions in their final collegiate games. Co-captain and former Crimson magazine chair Nicola Perlman grabbed eight saves, while the other Crimson co-captain, Devon MacLaughlin, netted a goal from center.
No. 16 INDIANA 9, HARVARD 7
Going into the fourth period on Saturday, things looked grim for the Crimson. The Hoosiers held a six-goal advantage and time was swiftly ticking away.
Although classic momentum shifts are usually attributed to dramatic, daring plays, it’s the simple fundamentals that provide the real filler and the basis for epic efforts. With less than five minutes left, sophomore Patricia Smith got back to those basics.
“We ran our system,” Smith said. “[The Hoosiers] were dropping off of me and they let me walk it in so I took the shot. It’s good to have that one shot out.”
The ensuing rally featured back-to-back goals from freshman and Northern Division Rookie of the Year Devan Kennifer, who found the net twice within two minutes.
“As a freshman at starting center, she amazes me every day and every time we play,” Smith said.
Kennifer’s classmate Lizzie Abbot wailed another shot past Indiana goaltender Cassie Wyckoff to bring Harvard to within one point of its stalling opponents with 44 seconds remaining on the clock.
But the speeding freight train that was the Crimson then hit an untimely snag. as Smith was issued a penalty within the Hoosiers’ box. The ensuing shot was good, bringing the score to an insurmountable 9-7 with only 16 seconds left.
No. 14 HARTWICK 16, HARVARD 3
Hartwick asserted its dominance of Blodgett pool from the start of the tournament on Friday. The Hawks grabbed a quick lead off of an early exclusion goal and then a backhanded shot from freshman Allyssa Analytis that soared past Perlman. 
Hartwick proceeded to take its lead and run with it; the Hawks flaunted a 6-1 advantage by halftime that was augmented by 10 more goals in the following two periods. And while Hartwick churned out points on offense, it locked down on the other end of the pool and allowed Harvard just one goal in the initial two periods and only three throughout the entire game. 
The Hartwick defense centered around netminder Jessica Dorman, who racked up 14 saves.

HANOVER, N.H.—Eliminated from the Rolfe Division race and resigned to another losing season, the Harvard baseball team began its doubleheader against Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H. on Saturday looking like a team with little left to play for. The Crimson had no answer for the Big Green’s relentless style of play in the first game of the twinbill, losing handily by a score of 14-2.But while there were few tangible rewards left to motivate Harvard (12-28, 10-10 Ivy) towards victory, the team still had its pride, and it came out in the nightcap better prepared to take down division-leading Dartmouth (22-13, 16-4 Ivy). A rejuvenated Crimson squad gutted out a gritty victory, sparked by the late-inning heroics that have been the trademark of Harvard’s victories this season. Captain Harry Douglas tripled home two runs in the top of the 10th and senior Tom Stack-Babich pitched 2 1/3 innings of shutout relief to give Harvard a 6-4 win in Game 2.“After the first game we wanted to show that we were going to play with some heart,” Douglas said. “We wanted to come out hard and get a win.”HARVARD 6, DARTMOUTH 4Extra-inning affairs provide some of the most dramatic and nerve-wracking moments in baseball, allowing little room for error and intensifying the importance of every pitch. It is surprising to see a team with a losing record thrive in such an environment, but that is exactly what the Crimson has done this season.After Harvard tied the second game of Saturday’s doubleheader at four in the top of the ninth, and Stack-Babich held the Big Green scoreless in the bottom of the frame, the Crimson put two runners on base in the 10th inning for Douglas.The Harvard captain delivered, driving an 0-2 pitch from Dartmouth closer Ryan Smith the opposite way into the right-field corner for the go-ahead triple, scoring sophomore Dillon O’Neill and senior Taylor Meehan.“I was just trying to get a pitch to put in play,” Douglas said. “The fastball came in low and away, and I was just trying to get the good part of the bat on it.”In the bottom of the 10th, Stack-Babich came through with an efficient end to his outstanding relief outing, inducing weak groundouts from the top three hitters in the Big Green lineup, including Dartmouth’s marquee slugger, Nick Santomauro.The win gives the Crimson a 3-0 record in extra-inning games this season.In the early innings, the game appeared to have the markings of a pitchers’ duel between Harvard rookie starter Brent Suter and the Big Green’s Ben Murray. But Suter injured his calf in the bottom of the fifth and was removed from the game after he tried to pitch through the pain but lost his effectiveness. After Dartmouth got on the board with a sacrifice fly, Big Green cleanup hitter Mike Pagliarulo belted a two-run homer off of lefty freshman reliever Will Keuper to give his team a 3-0 lead.The Crimson responded in kind in the bottom of the inning, when senior Matt Rogers turned on a Murray pitch and launched it over the left field fence.“I thought Rogers ran into a mistake pitch there,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “I give Rogers some credit, but they had him 0-2 and put it right up there.”The Crimson would go down 4-2 before executing its late-game comeback.DARTMOUTH 14, HARVARD 2Youth has its charms, but in baseball it can also be a burden.Because of the injuries and ineffectiveness that have plagued many of the Crimson’s veteran pitchers, the Harvard staff is comprised largely of freshmen. The team’s rookie hurlers have displayed potential and turned out some impressive performances this season, but at times their inexperience has produced rough outings.That was the case in the opener of Saturday’s twinbill, in which the freshman trio of Jonah Klees, Jeff Reynolds, and Marcus Way was unable to minimize its struggles and fell victim to a hard-hitting Big Green lineup. Klees failed to make it out of the second frame, getting tagged for six runs, with the big blast coming on a three-run shot by Johnathon Santopadre. Walsh attributed Klees’ mistake pitch to Santopadre to the rookie getting his signals crossed on a missed pickoff opportunity.“We had a pick on at second,” Walsh said. “When [Klees] threw the pitch he realized, ‘Uh-oh, I messed up.’ I think he just kind of laid it in there.”Klees was relieved by his classmate Reynolds, who got through 4 2/3 innings of work but allowed seven runs, five of which were earned. Way came in with two outs in the sixth, letting two of his inherited runners cross the plate before giving up an earned run of his own.—Staff writer Loren Amor can be reached at lamor@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This weekend marked more races against the best crews in the nation, but only the lightweight women’s crew team proved up to the task. While No. 2 Yale got the better of the Black and White heavyweight women’s crew team on Saturday morning in the Charles River Challenge, the lightweights knocked off No. 2 Princeton to win the Class of 2009 Cup.The No. 4 Black and White have done what only one other crew in the country has managed to do—beat Princeton in dual competition. With all the hard work and training, Radcliffe is starting to find its strongest rhythm yet.“I think we had a really solid piece,” junior Grace Hollowell said. “It was our best race to date.”In a race which the Black and White had not won in the last four years, nothing could thwart the lightweights.“We had a really solid week in practice coming off the Stanford race. It’s always fun racing Princeton, because there’s a big rivalry there,” Hollowell said. “We worked our butts off and it showed.”Winning the race four seconds ahead of the Tigers with a finishing time of 7:25.1, the Varsity Eight inched ahead after the first 10 strokes and had built a six seat lead after the first 500 meters.  By the final 400 meters, the race was all but over, as Radcliffe was able to accelerate after the midway point to an open-water lead that the varsity eight would not relinquish.“We got off to a good start,” Hollowell said. “By somewhere around 750, we were up by a couple of feet, but we were pretty even off the start. We really just moved in the second 500, and our middle 1000 was probably the best part of our piece.”The Tigers Varsity Four managed to thwart both the Black and White’s A and B boats with little difficulty. Princeton finished 10 seconds ahead of the Radcliffe A, which came from behind after the B boat jumped out to second place at the start.After a rocky first day that saw the No. 16 Black and White drop races to Yale, Virginia, and USC, the varsity squads responded with a clean sweep in yesterday’s concluding races of the Charles River Challenge against Gonzaga and Tennessee.The weekend opened with a tough loss to Yale in the Case Cup, a race marked by strong headwinds throughout the course. The Varsity Eight never managed to recover from Yale’s fast start that allowed the Bulldogs to open-up a boat-length lead halfway through the race. Yale finished in 6:56 with a 5.9-second margin of victory.“Our rhythm just didn’t really feel as long and strong as the rhythm we were finding in practice,” senior Sarah Moore said. “I think we gave up a little too much in the second 500 and against a crew that strong, you can’t really give them anything.”In the evening races, the Black and White adopted a different race plan, but still could not manage to get back on the right track, as Virginia and Southern California bested both the varsity and second varsity eight boats.“We felt like we had given up a little too much against Yale in the first 1000 meters in morning. Our plan in the afternoon was to go out and establish control of the race and keep moving from there,” Moore said.Even with Radcliffe in third place and finishing 4.5 seconds behind first-place Virginia, the Varsity Eight race made for an exciting finish nonetheless, as the Cavaliers crossed the finish line a slim 0.8 seconds ahead of Southern California.“It was a combination of having trouble internally with the middle 1000 and Virginia putting together a good second 500,” Moore said.Sunday provided the Black and White with a chance to rebound against Gonzaga and Tennessee and both of Radcliffe’s boats seized the opportunity. The Varsity Eight crushed the competition, finishing 16.1 seconds ahead of Tennessee and 22.4 seconds ahead of Gonzaga. The Second Varsity Eight won a tough race by three seconds against runner-up Tennessee. In addition, the Varsity Four A and B boats finished first and second, respectively, in their race.Races against opponents this weekend can affect bids for the NCAA tournament. The selection committee uses these outcomes to compare the quality of the crews from different regions of the country. —Staff writer Robert T. Hamlin can be reached at rhamlin@fas.harvard.edu.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With leading Ivy League Player of the Year candidate Nick Santomauro coming to bat for Dartmouth, Harvard baseball coach Joe Walsh knew he needed to play the percentages.It wasn’t an easy call. After all, his starter—freshman ace Conner Hulse—had handed him a gem, striking out six over 8 1/3 innings against the Rolfe Division champion Big Green.But with one out in the ninth inning of the last league game of the season for the Crimson, Walsh wanted the lefty-lefty matchup against Santomauro, bringing in rookie Will Keuper to face the junior slugger.For a brief second, it looked like the wrong move. Santomauro connected—and hard—on the second pitch of the at-bat, and the ball sailed to deep right center.But with a little help from the wind, the ball nested into the glove of sophomore center fielder Dillon O’Neill with his back against the wall.“It’s a good thing that sign out there says 370 and not 368 because otherwise we might still be playing,” Walsh said after the game.Senior second baseman Taylor Meehan took the mound to get  the final out, wrapping up the victory.The 4-3 win handed Harvard (12-28, 10-10 Ivy) a split in yesterday’s home double-header against Dartmouth (22-13, 16-4), enabling the Crimson to reach the .500 mark in league play this year.Like it’s been doing all season long, Harvard lived and died by its starting pitching.“The way these two games played out was typical of our season,” Walsh said.In the opening game of the twinbill, junior starter Dan Zailskas got roughed up, allowing nine earned runs before exiting in the fourth. The Big Green took the contest 11-5, clinching the Rolfe Division crown.But in the nightcap, Hulse helped the Crimson end the league schedule on a good note.“It’s a respect thing,” senior outfielder Tom Stack-Babich said of the win. “It’s about getting a little pride.”HARVARD 4, DARTMOUTH 3Having already earned its spot in next week’s Ivy League Championship series, the Big Green could afford to rest some of its regulars in the second game of the day.And Hulse took full advantage of the slightly weakened Dartmouth lineup. The freshman picked up his first collegiate win, giving up just three runs, walking only one batter, and threatening to pitch a complete game.“He’s been throwing strikes and being more aggressive than he was earlier in the year,” Stack Babich said of Hulse.“Conner’s established himself as one of the best pitchers in the Ivy League now,” captain Harry Douglas said.The double play was Hulse’s best friend over the course of the game. After nailing the first batter he faced, he gave up a couple of hits, putting the Crimson in a 1-0 hole. But after a fly out, freshman shortstop Jeff Reynolds made a nice play to turn two and get Hulse out of the inning.Harvard answered right back in the bottom of the frame, with Tyler Albright grounding into a fielders choice to bring home O’Neill.Dartmouth took the lead once again in the fourth, but this time, the Crimson scored two runs in the bottom half of the inning to take the lead.With Stack-Babich on first, Walsh sent in Zailskas as a pinch hitter. Making amends for his below-par pitching performance earlier, the junior knocked a big single up the middle. Senior outfielder Matt Rogers was then hit by a pitch to load the bases for Reynolds, who poked a hit through the right side of the infield, bringing home Stack-Babich and Zailskas.Harvard extended its lead to 4-2 in the fifth, courtesy of an RBI single from Stack-Babich.Hulse got into trouble in the seventh, but the double-play ball came to the rescue yet again. With no outs, an RBI double from senior Johnathon Santopadre pulled the Big Green to within one run, but a good throw from Rogers held the tying run at third. Walsh showed faith in his rookie hurler by leaving him in the game, and Hulse repaid his coach by getting a strikeout. He then intentionally walked the next batter to load the bases, before a big double play kept the Crimson lead intact.“Conner put us in a place to get a lot of ground balls,” Walsh said. “He’s throwing the ball from the top of the patella to the bottom of the patella—it’s just knee-high, knee-high, knee-high.”With the game on the line, Dartmouth pinch-hit its star Santomauro, forcing Walsh to make the pitching change.Santomauro—who was named to the all-Ivy first team in both his freshman and sophomore years—entered the series hitting over .400 on the season.“Santomauro is the best hitter in our league and has been for the last couple of years.”Meehan struck out Santopadre to end the game.“I like how we battled through and I’m proud of how we came out this weekend after the tough weekend against Brown,” Douglas said.DARTMOUTH 11, HARVARD 5The Big Green knew what it had to do coming into the day to ensure itself a chance to play for the Ivy League title, and was able to jump out to an early lead against Zailskas.Santomauro got the scoring started in the top of the first, knocking an RBI double down the right field line, and the Big Green strung together a few more hits in the inning to take a 3-0 lead.Santomauro got his second RBI of the day in the second, crushing a line drive to left, and Dartmouth was up 5-0 after just two innings.The Crimson pulled a few runs back in the third via a two-run error and an RBI single from Stack-Babich. The senior went 3-for-4 in the game and was Harvard’s main offensive threat on the day.“I feel like I’ve been hitting the ball really well the last couple of weeks, but just right at people,” Stack-Babich said. “So it was nice to get a couple hits that weren’t caught.”That would be as close as the Crimson would come, though, as the Big Green added four in the top of the next inning. Senior Ray Allen hit a three-run homer in the fourth after a bloop single had already scored a run.“Once you get tense and the pitches get up a little bit, they have some guys who can really drive the ball,” Walsh said.One of those hard-hit balls was snagged by O’Neill in the fifth, when the sophomore made a highlight-reel over-the-shoulder catch. He added a diving grab in the second game.Harvard returns to the diamond on Tuesday in its final game of the year against Northeastern.—Staff writer Jay M.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
HANOVER, N.H.—Harvard baseball’s Saturday split with Dartmouth displayed remarkably different outcomes in the two contests, with the Crimson suffering a 14-2 blowout before rebounding to top the Big Green, 6-4, in extra innings. While the games featured numerous differences, including a key two-run shot by senior Matt Rogers and a stellar outing from rookie Brent Suter in the nightcap, perhaps the largest improvement between the contests was the avoidance of the “big inning.”In game one, freshman starter Jonah Klees and classmate Jeff Reynolds were tagged with nine runs on seven hits in the second inning—including two home runs—as Dartmouth sent 12 hitters to the plate and effectively put the game out of reach before it began.“We’ve had some of these big innings that have crushed us,” Harvard coach Joe Walsh said. “I’ve been trying to say to guys we have to slow the games down during those innings.”Walsh’s observations have held true for much of the season. In three of the squad’s last eight losses, Harvard watched otherwise even games fall apart by yielding five runs or more in an inning.While hypothetical situations are often convenient excuses, without the second inning on Saturday the Crimson would have entered the sixth inning with a 2-1 edge.“[After the second inning] it was the type of game where you try to get some experience going,” Walsh said. “We have to minimize the big inning [to stay competitive]. A big inning should be three or four runs…but when you’re walking guys and hitting guys, that’s going to give you a very big inning.”BIG GREEN BLUESWith a raucous Dartmouth crowd in attendance for the dedication of the Big Green’s remodeled home, Rolfe Field at Biondi Park, there was no lack of boisterous heckling from the bleachers. While Harvard endured many verbal jabs, the umpires suffered the majority of Dartmouth’s ire.A tight strike zone from home plate umpire Brian Troupe gave both sides trouble, but the crowd erupted when Troupe refused to grant Big Green center fielder Brett Gardner first base after being hit by a pitch, ruling that the batter had failed to make an effort to get out of the way. Although disgruntled fans had a few choice words for the men in blue, Walsh implied that Dartmouth’s supporters may have suffered from selective memory—sophomore catcher Tyler Albright received the same call after being hit.“[The umpire] dug a hole for himself when Albright was called back, saying he was in the batter’s box,” Walsh said. “Part of that is [the rule against leaning into pitches] has become a point of emphasis in college baseball. They try to enforce it…which puts a whole lot of pressure on the umpires.”The situation heated up even more in the sixth, when junior Dan Zailskas squared to bunt and pulled back as a fastball tailed inside. Although the ball appeared to strike Zailskas when he was in the batter’s box, Troupe opted in this instance to grant the free pass. As expletives rained from the crowd and home bench, Big Green head coach Bob Whalen argued, to no avail.THE BALK MOVEAll year long Walsh has emphasized the little things, honing fundamentals on the diamond. One such focus has been pickoffs, of which the team has 10—including four by Suter—this season. In attempting these moves Harvard has also yielded eight balks, but Walsh welcomes the risk of granting an extra base.“I ask all the guys on the first day of the season, ‘How many of you got called for balks last year?’ And the answer is usually none,” Walsh said. “And I say, ‘Well we have to work on that. It’s a compliment to get called on a balk.’”Walsh encourages his hurlers to push the envelope on the mound, practicing a “balk move” that walks a thin line of legality. The weapon may have been on display Saturday, as senior Tom Stack-Babich incited the crowd once more by turning to throw to first in the ninth without clearly stepping off the rubber. The close call prompted more protest from Whelan, but Stack-Babich defended the move, saying, “I guess there was a potential balk, but I thought I stepped off.”The umpires agreed with the Crimson reliever, refusing to grant an extra base. Stack-Babich went on to pitch two scoreless innings of relief, silencing Dartmouth and earning his first victory of the season.—Staff writer Max N.

Goddamn it, prefrosh. All of our house lists are currently plagued by the pleas of clubs on campus asking for us college students to get your overeager asses to their events. And the thing is, you guys actually oblige with no shame.
So here it is: a list of things you can check out today. After all, you've been on campus for two days, and the denouement is here, my brave trekkers. So as you prepare to bid adieu to your new "friends," their clammy handshakes, and self-inflicted experimentation in awkward socialization, make sure you event-hop as much as you can. Ya'll are overachievers anyway.
See what's going down today after the jump.

8:15-9:15 AM, Campus jog for parents and students (meet at John Harvard Statue) — Let's be honest. This is weird. Don't do it.
11:00 AM-12:00 PM, Panel: "Office of Career Services: Connecting Students with Information and Opportunities" (Science Center B) — The event description starts most inauspiciously with this sentence: "Are you wondering what you might do next summer?" Look Harvard, these prefrosh are just looking for a good time. But you just took them into uncharted territory and then spanked their already future-oriented complexes into high gear. "Have you begun to think about what you might explore as possible career paths after graduation?" You don't have to tell Harvard students to worry prematurely—they'll do it fine themselves, thank you very much.
1:30-2:30 PM, Annual Prefrosh Concert with The Holden Choruses (Paine Hall)— featuring the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum, the Harvard Glee Club, and the Radcliffe Choral Society; choral repertoire will range from "Renaissance polyphony to folk songs to modern commissions." Please go to the concert and come back to tell us what that means.
2:00-3:00 PM, Panel: "What It's Like to be a Harvard Freshman" (Science Center B) — We already have the answer for you: perpetually confused, periodically drunk, consistently disillusioned.
6:30-7:30 PM, Science Activities Social (Women's Center) — "A relaxing way to meet a lot of scientists," the publicity assures. HUBSS will provide crepes, THURJ the ice cream, and WISHR the monkey bread (AKA pinch-me cake).
7 PM, Sex at Harvard (Sever 102) — Do you ever "[w]onder what the Harvard sex scene is really like?" Or, better yet, "if it exists?" Come get the sobering answer at this panel discussion manned by some of the biggest groups on campus that work with gender/sexuality issues. If there's anything that might deter hedonistic prefrosh from choosing Harvard, it might be this.
7:30 PM, Outwit: The Freestyle Rap Competition (Ticknor Lounge, Boylston Hall) — Supposedly, some of Harvard's "finest rhythm aces" and singsong wordsmiths are going to battle it out for "glory, fame"  in an event organized by Tuesday Magazine. We have a hunch that the content won't quite take the "money, cash, hoes" angle we're used to.
11:00 PM-1:00 AM, Movie: Legally Blonde (Science Center C) — Just an idea: there's really no need to watch a movie about being at Harvard while you're at Harvard.

Yale: 1. School spirit? Check! Deep-seated inferiority complex? Of course not! Who told you that? BOOLAH-BOOLAH DANNY BOY! 2. Prefrosh. The place your annoying prefrosh roommate can’t stop talking about because she knows she’s going there for sure because the campus is so much prettier than Harvard’s and the people are way smarter and cooler and hotter and she’s too good for Harvard anyway but her parents made her visit…etc. Synonyms. Stanford, Princeton, Brown. Antonyms. MIT.

Some might favor a jog along the river, a picnic, or some other such nonsense to celebrate the best weekend weather we've had this year. Not these two, snapped yesterday afternoon from the banks of the Charles. We also overheard so many prefrosh commenting about the nice weather. So clueless.
Weather for the last week of classes? Decidedly summer-like for the next two days, and we won't have a high below 60 through Friday. This will make racing to finish a final assignment in Lamont feel oh, so much better...
