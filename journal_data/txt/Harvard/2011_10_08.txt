After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A trio of women—including Liberian President and last year’s Commencement speaker Ellen Johnson Sirleaf—have been selected by the Nobel Committee as this year’s Peace Prize winners in recognition of their efforts to promote peace in their respective countries.
In addition to Johnson Sirleaf, who graduated from the Harvard Kennedy School in 1971, the committee awarded the prize to the Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee and the Yemeni pro-democracy activist Tawakkol Karman, who is a leader in the months-old pro-democracy movement in Yemen.
This year’s prize is the first awarded to a woman since the Kenyan activist Wangari Maathai won in 2004, and in its official citation the Oslo-based Peace Prize Committee said that the award should be seen as a recognition of women’s contributions to peace and democracy.
“We cannot achieve democracy and lasting peace in the world unless women obtain the same opportunities as men to influence developments at all levels of society,” said Thorbjorn Jagland, a former prime minister of Norway and head of the Peace Prize committee.
Johnson Sirleaf is widely credited with restoring stability to Liberia, though the country remains plagued by poverty and unemployment. She is the first woman to be elected president of an African country and is currently in the midst of a tough reelection campaign.
“I’m thrilled and I think that it’s a terrific award, and it’s a wonderful message and symbol about the remarkable role that women are playing in the democratizing of the world,” said Kennedy School Dean David T. Ellwood ’75.
In Liberia, Johnson Sirleaf has become known as the “Iron Lady” for her strong stance against corruption and her efforts in support of human rights reforms.
“She has the technical skill to rebuild the country’s economy, to lead it in its efforts to create a high functioning infrastructure, and to help the people envision and build a new reality for their country going forward,” said Victoria A. Budson, the executive director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the Kennedy School.
In her Commencement address, Johnson Sirleaf highlighted the contribution of women in ending Liberia’s long-running, bloody civil war, saying that Liberian women had “fought the final battle for peace” by demonstrating in opposition to the war. In the same speech, Johnson Sirleaf gently chastised the United States for having failed to elect a woman to its highest office.
“Let me remind you, America, that Liberia has you beat on one score: We elected our first female president, perhaps 11 years before the United States might do so,” Johnson Sirleaf, who became president in 2006, said to laughter from the audience.
Gbowee has worked alongside Johnson Sirleaf in Liberia and was praised by the committee for her unceasing efforts to unite Liberia’s Christian and Muslim populations. “Leymah Gbowee mobilized and organized women across ethnic and religious dividing lines to bring an end to the long war in Liberia, and to ensure women’s participation in elections. She has since worked to enhance the influence of women in West Africa during and after war,” the Nobel citation said.
Karman, who since February has lived in a tent at an anti-government protest, has become one of the leaders of the protest against the regime of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. His regime is one of several to face sustained protests in the region. That movement, known as the Arab Spring, led to widespread speculation before the announcement of the recipients of the Peace Prize that the committee would honor one of the leaders of the revolts that have toppled governments in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
Last year, the prize was awarded to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, leading to vehement condemnations by the Chinese government. The previous year, the prize went to President Barack Obama, a decision that caused international controversy.
The prize awards its recipients $1.5 million. This year, it will be split equally between the three recipients.
Sirleaf Johnson joins a slew of Harvard graduates to be awarded Nobel prizes this year, including three Harvard educated physicists—Saul Perlmutter ’81, Adam G. Riess, and Brian P. Schmidt—and Ralph M. Steinman, who won the prize for medicine.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite getting off to a slow start in its Ivy League season, the Harvard women’s volleyball team (9-5, 2-2 Ivy) continues to gain momentum in the Ancient Eight after earning its second conference win over Brown (5-10, 1-3) Friday night.
The victory came on the heels of a win over Penn last weekend and gives the Crimson a two-game winning streak entering its match Saturday against Yale. Harvard took the Bears in four games, winning 25-22, 25-17, 17-25, and 25-22.
The Crimson controlled the match from the beginning, taking the first two sets with ease. The only scare came in the first frame, when Brown pulled within one, 23-22, late in the game. However, a Bears service error and a kill by freshman Kristen Casey ensured the Harvard victory and gave the Crimson a one-game cushion.
Harvard took the second set but dropped the third following an eight point run by Brown, who took the set handily, 25-17.
But the loss did not sap the resolve of the Crimson, which responded with a dominant performance in the fourth and final game. Harvard garnered the lead at 9-8 in the set and never relinquished it, riding its momentum to a 25-22 win and 3-1 match victory.
“We went into the match with the simple goal of playing in our system no matter what was going on Brown’s side of the net,” sophomore Natalie Doyle said. “This must was a must-win.”
Doyle and Casey led the offensive effort with 40 assists and 21 kills, respectively. The latter number marked a new career-high for Casey. Co-captain Christine Wu bolstered the defense with 26 digs, giving her 307 digs on the season.
The Crimson faces the Bulldogs at 5 pm on Saturday night.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y.—Despite a defiant Big Red squad keeping pace in the early going, the Harvard football team created some separation from the hosts in the second half to snatch its second Ivy win of the season, 41-31.
Junior quarterback Colton Chapple, filling in for senior Collier Winters and starting his third straight game this season, led the visitors to victory with an impressive performance. The sophomore made history by passing for 414 yards, sixth on Harvard's all-time passing list. Chapple hit his receivers for four touchdowns and only had one interception on the day.
“I think the second half went right,” the junior said. “The first half, I definitely struggled a little bit—I was not in a rhythm, and I felt like I was thinking a little bit too much instead of going out and just playing. That's why I had success the past two weeks: going out there and playing this great game with these guys. You go through war with these guys.”
His longest pass of the game came in the third quarter, when the quarterback completed a 42-yard toss to senior wide receiver Alex Sarkisian for the Crimson’s third touchdown of the contest. The score gave Harvard a 27-24 lead, and the visitors never looked back, outscoring the Big Red, 21-14, in the second half.
Sarkisian was the Crimson’s leading receiver, recording 112 yards and one touchdown. Senior wide receiver Chris Lorditch also reached triple digits, posting 103 yards on the day.
Cornell did not go down easily, scoring the first touchdown in each half. But Harvard stuck to its game plan, outplaying a Cornell secondary that allowed Chapple to throw over the middle several times for scores.
Big Red QB Jeff Mathews did not have a shabby day himself, throwing for 322 yards and three touchdowns. The Cornell signal caller came out firing on all cylinders, throwing for a 12-yard gain to start the game. He followed that up with a 16-yard completion that put his team on Harvard’s 40-yard line. Mathews was not done, connecting with senior WR Shane Savage on a deep-post play that the wide receiver capped with a run to the end zone. The three-play drive lasted just 1:11 and covered 70 yards.
“Our perception of Jeff Mathews coming in was spot on,” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said. “Kid’s one of the great players in our conference—I thought that [when he was] coming out of high school.”
It took 10 minutes for Harvard to respond. With 3:50 remaining in the opening period, Chapple threw an 11-yard fade to senior wide receiver Adam Chrissis, who caught the ball in the corner of the end zone. Chrissis finished third on the team with 84 yards on the day.
Mathews didn’t come up with much on the next drive, thanks in part to senior defensive tackle Josue Ortiz’s sack on third down. Ortiz finished the game with two sacks, half of the team’s total on the day.
“When you consider that he gets double-teamed almost every snap, he did a man’s job out there,” Murphy said. “He was tremendous.”
Harvard took a three-point lead thanks to a field goal by sophomore kicker David Mothander 47 seconds into the second quarter.
Cornell would answer back two minutes later. The Crimson defense pressured Mathews but the Big Red quarterback kept his cool, lobbing a screen pass to Savage, who ran it into the end zone for the 39-yard score to put Cornell back up, 14-10.
From there, the scoring in the second quarter was far from over. After the Big Red put away a 31-yard field goal with 6:46 remaining, Chapple led his team down the field again from Harvard’s 38, throwing first to Sarkisian for a nine-yard completion and then to Chrissis for a 41-yard catch. From Cornell’s 8-yard line, freshman running back Zach Boden forced his way down the middle to the end zone to tie the game, 17-17.
Before the period ended, Mothander successfully kicked a 26-yard attempt to give the Crimson a 20-17 halftime lead.
The visitors received the ball to start the second half but failed to make an impact from the get-go. After a turnover on downs, the Big Red took advantage of the opportunity to take the lead again. A trick play saw Mathews hand off the ball to tight end Ryan Houska, who then ran a reverse with wide receiver Lucas Tasker that put Cornell two yards away from the goal line. Houska then ran the ball in for the score to give Cornell a 24-20 lead.
But Chapple would not allow the Big Red to gain momentum. After hitting Sarkisian for a nine-yard gain from the Crimson 48, the junior threaded a dangerous pass through two Cornell defenders into the arms of Sarkisian once again, who ran it in for the touchdown.
“We gave up too many big plays on defense, period,” Cornell coach Kent Austin  said. “We knew they were probably going to play some jump balls on our corners … [Chapple] threw the ball very well, and their receivers made plays for them.”
With the score set at 27-24, there was little room for mistakes, but the Big Red committed a big one. After Mathews wasted a third down and was almost intercepted, Harvard’s defense rushed Cornell’s punter, who could not handle a poor snap.
“That punt was huge,” Ortiz said. “From there, I feel like that was the big turning point … We started pumping ourselves up, and once we get going emotionally, it’s hard to stop us.”
The miscue gave the Crimson great field position on the host’s 38, and Chapple seized the chance to build the squad's lead. The junior moved the team down to the 27-yard line before the end of the third quarter, and once the fourth began, Chapple threw a long pass down the middle to sophomore tight end Cameron Brate for the score.
The Crimson would reach the end zone once more in the fourth quarter thanks to Chapple’s 26-yard pass to junior tight end Kyle Juszczyk, which gave Harvard a 17-point lead at 41-24. Mathews tried to whittle down the score, but with only 10:50 left to play, the sophomore quarterback could only do so much. Harvard’s defense kept Cornell at bay for most of the final minutes, with Mathews achieving only one more score, a 44-yard touchdown pass to Tasker with 2:27 remaining.
“We handled the fourth quarter pretty well,” Murphy said. “I think we were just a more grown-up, experienced, mature team, and that’s what grown-up, experienced, mature teams do—but in a year, that’s going to be Cornell.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Throughout the past weeks, Harvard co-captain Melanie Baskind and freshman Meg Casscells-Hamby have provided the go-to force for the Crimson women's soccer team (7-4-1, 2-0-1 Ivy), taking 37 and 33 shots, respectively, this season.
But playing against Cornell (2-9-1, 0-2-1 Ivy) in Ithaca earlier today, Harvard relied on goals by junior Aisha Price and sophomore Elizabeth Weisman to carry the team to a 2-2 tie and keep the Crimson at the top of the Ivy League rankings.
Price put the Crimson on the board first, heading in a goal off of a corner kick by co-captain Lindsey Kowal in the 73rd minute. Winless in the Ancient Eight coming into today's game, Cornell refused to let a win slip away. Only 16 seconds after Price's header, Abigail Apistolas scored for the Big Red to tie the game.
While Harvard continued to attack, taking 15 shots on goal compared to Cornell's eight, Big Red goaltender Megan Bartlett remained impassable, making six saves overall. At 84:12, Weisman sneaked a shot past Bartlett, converting a pass by Price into a 2-1 lead. But with 1:42 left in the game, Cornell's Maneesha Chitanvis hammered in a pass by Apistolas into another tying goal for the Big Red.
A scoreless 15 minutes in overtime provided the Ivy League with its first tie of the season. Harvard plays Siena on Tuesday in its final non-conference game before facing four Ancient Eight opponents to end the regular season.

Even though the Memorial Hall Church bells are no longer ringing, you may start to hear the sound of wedding bells around Harvard. While many students are still searching for their special someone, some have already found the one and only for them.
Not only do these students have to juggle problems sets with extracurricular activities, but they have to plan an entire wedding.
Recently engaged, Anna Veverica, a junior in Quincy House said, "It's tough to find time to plan the wedding. But it's actually comforting to have one part of my life figured out while I'm stressing out about MCATs and applying to medical schools and GPAs and extracurriculars and exams and papers and everything stressful about being a pre-med student at Harvard."
Veverica met her fiancé in her hometown in Michigan, and they hope to get married by Lake Michigan, where they had their first official date.
Meanwhile, Brooke McDowell, a senior in Pforzheimer House, met her fiancé Peter Lifland '10 at a party in Pfoho. When asked if she ever thought she might be married at this age, "I was raised in a conservative Christian family, so marriage during or right after college was always presented as the norm. I think that some of my friends at home might have even been surprised if I hadn't found my fiancé in college,” McDowell said.
Nick Waldo a junior in Kirkland House wasn't surprised about his recent engagement, which took place two months ago. "Expect? No. Recognize the possibility? Yes. I've always intended to marry early, the fact that I found my perfect partner this young is a blessing I wasn't counting on,” Waldo said.
Many students may not even be able to imagine themselves getting married during college. They can still barely even do their own laundry, let alone help someone else do theirs.
"What's weird isn't being in college while engaged, but in Harvard. Everyone here is so focused on their careers and their own lives. They are always shocked that I would link my life to someone else," Waldo said.
Luckily, these long distance relationships have the advances in technology to aid them along their journey to love. Veverica uses Skype to keep in frequent contact with her fiancé.
However, sometimes Skype is not enough to keep an engagement alive. As Katherine Baus, a freshman who recently ended her engagement, discovered, the transition to college can change a relationship.
"It was a really tough transition from seeing each other every day, being physically together—and being physical in general—to only being able to talk in text, on the phone, or over Skype. Being in a long-distance relationship itself was difficult, and we both started questioning, often to each other, whether we'd even make it through the next couple of months, let alone, you know, the rest of our lives," Baus said.
But as college students realize most relationships will have their ups and downs.
"We're both still open to the possibility of getting engaged someday—in a couple of years, at least," Baus said.
"The day of our first kiss she punched me in the face. Just one, right to the nose. I didn't get the kiss until after I'd stopped bleeding," Waldo said.
Whatever makes eternal dedication happen for some Harvard students, the rest of us single people will just have to wait for that right someone to sing "Endless Love" with. Just remember if you are on the lookout, as seen on "On Harvard Time," Harvard could be the best place to husband (or even wife) hunt, so keep your eyes out.

From Japanese sushi to Mexican burritos to Indian curries, there is a diverse range of ethnic cuisine in Harvard Square. And there is a new eatery in town that serves fresh, baked-to-order Belgian waffle. Zinneken's, located on Mass Ave. in a space previously occupied by Arrow Street Crepes, is founded by Nhon Ma and Bertrand Lempkowicz, who first met in high school in the 90s. "Zinneke," in Brussels dialect, means someone of mixed origins, which not only represents the founders, but also their ambitions to introduce authentic Belgian food to Cambridge and its visitors. Zinneken's serves Belgian waffle made of dough melted with pearl sugar drops, so it has distinct density and texture different from the traditional American waffles made from liquid batter.
