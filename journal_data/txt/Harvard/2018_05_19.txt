After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Middle-aged Matteo (Riccardo Scamarcio) and his older brother Ettore (Valerio Mastandrea) lead very different lives: While Matteo, in the business of artistic restoration, self-medicates with booze and lines of coke, Ettore, a schoolteacher, suffers tumultuous relationships with his estranged wife, Michaela (Isabella Ferrari), and 30-year-old girlfriend, Elena (Jasmine Trinca). However, when Matteo learns that his brother Ettore has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, he hides the news of the diagnosis from Ettore and the rest of their family, attempting to spare his brother’s sadness and forestall the act of mourning. But Matteo’s attempts to keep Ettore from discovering the truth about his own mortality catch up to him, and he quickly finds himself entangled in the messy turmoil of Ettore’s personal life. Meanwhile, Ettore grows resentful of his brother for holding the upper hand in literal matters of life and death, the way he throws money around carelessly to assert his status.
“Euforia,” which premiered as part of the Un Certain Regard category at the Cannes Film Festival, could have been an intense family drama about the ethical implications of handling terminally ill patients or the bonds that hold brothers together. But instead, Italian director Valeria Golino turns it into a bloodless pseudo-comedy that handles its very serious subjects with flippant, misplaced humor and turns its characters into tropes whose respective redemptive arcs feel emotionally unmerited, especially by the film’s supposedly cathartic conclusion.
Just why anyone does anything in “Euforia” is a mystery: Characters act without real motives and behave, in all frankness, like petulant children. Matteo’s insistence on keeping Ettore in the dark about his own illness, his constant dishonesty to both of Ettore’s romantic partners, his insouciance about money from his luxury designer clothes to his playboy penthouse apartment—there’s very little that suggests he’ll compensate for his selfishness and amorality, so it’s unbelievable when he does. The same is true of Ettore, whose illness turns him sullen and grizzled, and who essentially turns a blind eye to his dual role as caretaker, as a father to Andrea and as a schoolteacher, although certainly more excusably than his brother. Ettore’s wife, Michaela, is frequently weepy, or as Ettore himself describes her, “vacuous and shallow.”
But it’s more than the characters themselves that make “Euforia” hard to watch, in the worst way; it’s their interactions with each other, which are almost always tonally incorrect. Matteo and Ettore’s arguments toward the end of the film grow particularly vicious—Ettore hurls a gay slur more than once, while Matteo snaps, “When are you going to die?”—without any obvious resolution. It would have been fine—chalk it up to realism for realism’s sake, depicting family feuds in their acrimonious reality—had Golino not tried to capitalize on their fraternal love later, reaping the benefits of a seed “Euforia” does not properly sow. There isn’t any impetus for making up, yet it happens anyway, as if the characters know the film is approaching a two hours’ runtime and they ought to wrap up the still-unresolved conflict.
The ethical gray area at the center of “Euforia”—whether Ettore ought to know that his brain tumor is not, as he assumes, a benign cyst, and that his days left are dwindling—is often treated as a comedic impulse, without the appropriate gravitas. Sometimes the comedy is warranted, even effective; for example, the moment in which Matteo makes Ettore leave their shared hotel room in the cold, so he can entertain a male guest is genuinely humorous (“Take the blanket,” Matteo insists, pushing him out of bed, and Ettore looks across the street to see a store full of figurines of the Virgin Mary). But other moments indicate that “Euforia” is funny in the wrong places, at the wrong times. The moment in which Matteo and Ettore engage in a bitter back-and-forth on the rooftop, one that ought to be given its proper sobriety, is punctuated by a dead fish landing from out of the sky, dropped unceremoniously by a passing seagull. It’s emblematic of “Euforia”’s failure to embody the genre it attempts to be (presumably, tragicomedy). Golino’s attempt to pinpoint the emotional heart of a tragedy between brothers is quite off-target, and its viewers will be left feeling a lot less than euphoric.

This year’s Cannes Film Festival is plagued by bad parents. They’re abusive, like Zain’s selfish parents Selim and Souad in “Capharnaüm” or Karin Viard’s disbelieving Mado in “Les Chatouilles.” Or worse, they’re absent, too busy with their own problems, like Marion Cotillard’s negligent Marlene in “Gueule d’Ange” or Carey Mulligan and Jake Gyllenhaal’s Jeannete and Jerry Brinson in “Wildlife.”
The parents in “Manbiki Kazoku” (“Shoplifters”), Osamu (Lily Franky) and Nobuyo (Ando Sakura), a construction worker and an industrial laundry worker respectively, aren’t delinquent, or violent, or cruel. In fact, they’re very good parents—they keep food on the table, bring their children to the beach on summer days, and give them new clothes when they need them. What’s more, they love each other and their children, giving them what they can with their humble means and sacrificing for their kids.
They also happen to be petty criminals, teaching their son, Shota (Jyo Kairi), to shoplift. One day, after shoplifting, Shota and Osamu come across a little girl (Miyu Sasaki) on a neighboring front porch and decide to bring her home. Her bruises and flinching mannerisms suggest child abuse, and Nobuyo genuinely begins to love her—so it makes sense that they keep her and rename her Rin, giving her the affectionate home that her real parents couldn’t. The Shibata family becomes a perfect domestic unit: the parents, Shota and Rin, their grandmother (Kirin Kiki), and an older sister Aki (Mayu Matsuoka).
But Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda gently teases out the truth, until the Shibata family reveals the dark secrets that bind them together. Shota explains away wrongdoing with obviously rehearsed aphorisms—“Only kids who can’t study at home go to school,” for school truancy; “Whatever’s in a store doesn’t belong to anyone yet,” for shoplifting. The grandmother’s regular siphoning of “pension” from her husband’s mistress’s family begins to seem more and more like a scam, and Aki’s side-job—a stripper in a chatroom peep show—feels less family-friendly and more “Secret Diary of a Call Girl.” And, most saliently: Why does each member of this family steal so casually, Shota covertly dropping bags of potato chips and packages of ramen noodles into his backpack, Nobuyo taking jewelry left behind in the pockets of the clothes she cleans?
Cannes veteran Kore-eda paints a tender picture of a makeshift family, parents who build a life for themselves despite their societal illegitimacy and relative squalor. Kore-eda’s lovely camerawork makes an imaginary mansion of their meager Tokyo home, showing the beauty to be found in simple places. If at times a bit logistically confusing, “Shoplifters” gracefully balances complicated ethical queries—can you choose your children? Is it wrong to break the law if it helps someone in need?—with an intensely human portrait of a unit of people, whose warmth and care for one another is markedly unforced.
Logistically, some of the film’s particulars are complicated. It’s slightly unclear how the original members of the family came together—is the grandmother biologically related to Osamu or Nobuyo? How exactly did Aki join the clan?—but those uncertainties are relegated to an unimportant subplot, anyway. “Shoplifters” works best as a character study of a family, honing in on each member in turns, namely parents, Osamu and Nobuyu. Ando Sakura gives a subtly genius performance as Nobuyo, whose maternal instinct is like sight or sound, effortless and natural. “If they say they hit you because they love you, that is a lie,” Nobuyu tells Rin. “If they love you, this is what they do.” She gives her a hug, and Kore-eda makes it clear that it would be ludicrous to see her as anything besides Rin’s proper mother. Half of that performance ought to also be credited to Kairi and Sasaki, whose baby performances are some of the most innocent and wide-eyed to date. Kore-eda uses his actors tactfully, building their small, yet wonderful world with great care.
But Rin is still, in effect, a kidnapped child, no matter how perfect her new family and home. And Shota, who gradually comes of age, begins to realize the unconvention underpinning his family life. The fragility of their familial bond is apparent from the outset, which makes the jarring last half-hour of the film—spiraling into one confession after another—particularly tragic. The film’s explanation unravels quickly, and here Kore-eda hits blunt revelations, masterfully cutting together police testimonies and interviews. They ought to make these characters villainous, but if anything they have the opposite effect. In fact, they’re more human than ever before.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) arrives at the Colorado Springs Police Department, he undergoes an interview meant to test his ability to keep his cool as the precinct’s potential first black cop of the town, an inevitably contradictory role to take on. “What would you do if—” starts off Chief Bridges, (Robert John Burke) before hesitating. “What would you do if another cop called you a nigger?” finishes his black counterpart (Craig muMs Grant). The correct answer? To turn the other cheek, something Ron proves to be relatively bad at. But he is willing to do anything to be a cop. “I’ll even chop down the natural,” he says of his glorious afro. He’s hired, and that’s when the real work begins. Relegated to the data files, he grows bored of getting his colleagues the files on the relevant criminal. He is challenging and uncompromising, something the police department is not used to, which is why he’s eventually placed in the Intelligence department. There, he decides to infiltrate the Colorado Springs chapter of the KKK from the inside out, setting off a chain of events in Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman”—a testament to the director’s ability to weave the politics of the past and present, of identity, race, and religion, in an alternatively comedic, disturbing, and suspenseful thrill ride based on an unbelievably true story.
Flip Zimmerman (Adam Driver) must also pass a series of tests as he plays the white version of Ron Stallworth, the only one palatable to the KKK—the “Organization,” for those in the know. Forced to take a lie detector test, Zimmerman must prove to Felix (Jasper Pääkkönen), the unhinged Klansman, that he is not Jewish, which of course he is. Here, Lee adds yet another layer to the complex identity politics he explores in his film, for like Real Ron Stallworth does with his blackness, Fake Ron Stallworth also grapples with his Jewish background: “I was just another white kid,” Zimmerman reminisces about his childhood. “I never thought much about it [being Jewish]. Now I think about it all the time.” Truth be told, he has no other choice as the Klansmen he surrounds himself with insist that the Holocaust is “an international Jewish conspiracy.” At the end of the day, however, Zimmerman does not have the same stakes in the investigation that Ron does, making his character one we never fully care about. Because where Zimmerman can hide his Jewish faith, Ron cannot hide his blackness: “For you, it’s a crusade. For me, it’s a job,” says Flip, a distinction Ron is already sharply aware of.
Admittedly, “BlacKkKlansman” is a masterwork in teasing out, both explicitly and implicitly, another integral but relatively lesser known aspect of identity politics: codeswitching. “They’re going to know the difference between how a white man speaks and how a black man speaks,” warns Chief Bridges, cautioning Ron against embarking on the dangerous quest. “How does a black man speak?” asks Ron in response. Bridges’ subsequent silence says it all, though David Duke (Topher Grace) isn’t so easily convinced. “I can always tell when I’m speaking to a Negro,” he insists, while unknowingly speaking to Ron, a so-called Negro. Ron Stallworth thus comes to embody two different people: a white KKK enthusiast, and a black undercover cop trying to protect the black power movement he has been dragged into with both mind and heart. After he meets Patrice (Laura Harrier), president of the Black Students Union of Colorado Springs College, he hears the inspiring words (“If I’m not for myself, who will be? If not now, when?”) of Kwame Ture (Corey Hawkins), formerly Stokely Carmichael. As two prominent black figures in Colorado Springs, neither is immune to the town’s racist cops, or pigs as Patrice likes to call them. And in a brilliantly subversive twist, Patrice is also a subject of reverse codeswitching: For Ron, she is “Sister Angela Davis”; for Connie, she is “Angela Davis, Commie.”
Having paid homage to the great black figures of the past—let’s not forget to add Martin Luther King, Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Mohammed Ali to the list—Lee does not shy away from also invoking the present, creatively sprinkling just the right amount of politicized winks in an undeniably political film. Alec Baldwin briefly appears in a cameo at the start of “BlacKkKlansman,” in which he plays a Klansman filming a pro-KKK commercial. “We are living in an era marked by the spread of integration and miscegenation,” he says to the camera, his body language uncannily reminiscent of his famous portrayal of Trump on SNL. “Nobody would elect someone like David Duke president of America,” says another cop over an image of David Duke, his blond coiffe a double-whammy alluding to both anti-Trumpian surprise at his election and disdain at the real David Duke’s campaign for Senator of Louisiana. Fictionalized Duke plays on Trump’s rhetoric, too: “We need people like you to be in office,” he says to Real Ron Howard. “To take back America’s greatness again.” And in its denunciation of Donald Trump, “BlacKkKlansman” also calls out white women’s participation in the KKK movement in the character of Connie (Ashlie Atkinson), Felix’s wife. In another subtle reference to white women’s complicit role in Trump’s election (more than half of white women who voted in 2016 voted for Donald Trump), Connie jumps at the occasion to participate in the KKK’s mission to rid Colorado Springs of the louder black voices threatening white America. “That will be all,” Felix had cut Connie off at the beginning of the film. When the time comes, though, all lies in Connie’s hands.
What ensues is a thrilling ride of a movie, one so well-paced it trades in character development for suspense. Ron grows to accept what he initially sees as Patrice’s radical and revolutionary rhetoric, and in turn, Patrice starts reluctantly accepting Ron, the man working for what she sees as the enemy. But she actually ends up regressing, eventually coming to reject him despite his role in infiltrating the KKK, their budding romance rendered pointless. Flip is the perfect partner, faltering in his imitation of Ron but having his friend’s back at just the right moment. Unfortunately, he does little else in any other capacity, playing the racist, anti-semitic Klansman but never confronting his own conflicting feelings about the issues he finds himself at the center of. At the end of the day, we care for these characters’ causes, but we couldn’t care less about the characters themselves.
In typical Spike Lee-style, however, the director succeeds in telling a true story that he brilliantly links to the film’s emotional ending, one that particularly resonates in today’s day and age. “Dis joint is based on some fo’ real, fo’ real shit,” reads a title card at the beginning of the film. And unfortunately, the events that take place in the movie adapted from real-life Ron Stallworth’s memoir remain all too real even today. But that’s why “BlacKkKlansman” resonates, resounding even after the credits roll. Because in a country that continues to devalue the lives of black people and those who would protect them, “BlacKkKlansman” is the devastatingly funny, enlighteningly subversive, and—most importantly—timely reminder that history does, in fact, repeat itself.

“Chapter 12” of “Legion” revisits the traumatic stories of Syd’s (Rachel Keller) life over and over and over again. Except this isn’t a tale about pity, or “the story of the little girl whose mommy couldn’t hug her, who grew up wishing a prince’s kiss could erase all her damage,” as David (Dan Stevens) aptly puts it. “It’s about the damage itself, and how it makes us strong, not weak.” In the fourth episode of its second season, “Legion” finally pays attention to one of its main characters, Syd, who has been undeservedly underexplored until now. “Chapter 12” reveals a wider emotional range for Keller, a potentially disturbing twist to David’s lovey-dovey story, and the multifaceted character work needed for Syd to be more than just a supporting star.
In “Chapter 12,” Syd shows David how her ability to switch places with people through physical touch shapes, breaks, and makes her life. They watch a scene of her infant self shying away from her mother’s touch. a scene of her standing up to her school bullies by switching bodies with the lacrosse player who tried to forcibly kiss her, beating the bullies with the lacrosse player’s stick, and then framing him after she switches back into her own body.
David walks through these scenes again and again, trying to understand the point Syd is trying to make. He takes several guesses, all of which miss the mark. “Again,” Syd says dryly, unimpressed. At one point, he adorably (and somewhat frustratingly) tries to make the revelation of Syd’s memories about him, assuming that she is ashamed of her past and wants David’s stamp of approval.
But that’s not what Syd’s story is. The turning point in the episode (and maybe in the season) comes when David visits a scene Syd mentioned in Season One. Curious, Syd switches places with her mother and then gets in the shower with her mother’s boyfriend, who sees his girlfriend’s body, not Syd. Syd and her mother abruptly switch back, people start screaming, and the boyfriend is presumably arrested for statutory rape.
That’s when things click for David. “It’s not about being alone, or being in love. It’s about the things you survived,” he says. “And as it’s written, ‘The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.’” Syd isn’t here to be the pretty love interest in David’s fairytale story. For Syd, those dreams are foolish and unnecessary, a perspective that works as a welcome new facet to her previously underwritten character.
“You said you saw the future, and it’s an apocalypse. Who survives that? The lovers? Or the fighters?” Syd asks. “They sell us this lie that love is gonna save us. All it does is make us stupid and weak.”
“Thanks,” David says, looking and feeling pathetic. Throughout this episode, Keller has remained ice cold in her portrayal of Syd, while David furiously runs around her life, propelled by his fanciful notion of love. The juxtaposition between the two acting styles—between detachment and passion—beautifully comes into place, not only serving as necessary character work, but also as a way to build up potential conflict in a nearing plotline. “Legion” has hinted at what the monster of Season Two is—something so powerful that the heroes need to team up with the Shadow King in order to stop it. So far, one of the likeliest bets is that the monster is David, making Syd’s prioritization of survival over love all the more important. If Syd eventually has to choose between love and living, it’s likely that Syd will choose the second option. “Look at me,” she says to David. “Love isn’t going to save us. It’s what we have to save.”
But for now, it looks like David will be sticking around for the ride. In the center of a small igloo with only two sources of light—the ice bricks’ blue glow and the plastic fire’s flames—Syd extends an invitation to David. “God loves the sinners best because our fire burns bright, bright, bright,” she says. “Burn with me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Zain (Zain Al Rafeea), who is serving a five-year sentence in juvie “because I stabbed a son of a bitch with a knife,” as he so eloquently puts it, was previously living a meagre life, mitigated by his sister’s love and friendship. Zain would stop at nothing to keep his younger sister Sahar (Haita Izam) close, washing out her underwear when she got her first period, giving her his shirt to use as a makeshift pad, stealing stacks of real ones from the store knowing her betrothal and departure was imminent if the truth came out. But despite his meticulous efforts, Sahar is married off to a much older man, their parents hoping the union will give her a life better than their current, dilapidated conditions. “Was she a plant or a tree, to blossom?” Zain demands during another trial, this time in order to sue his parents for “giving him life.” The rhetorical question is more than accusatory; it is a condemnation of his parents’ poor parenting, their failure to adequately care for their children marked in the body too skinny for Zain’s big head, in his imprisonment, in Sahar’s absence, in Zain’s lack of any papers whatsoever—from birth certificate to enrollment in school.
In “Capharnaüm,” director Nadine Labaki paints a depressing tableau of a vicious cycle that Zain unfortunately gets caught up in; one that perpetuates itself much too frequently in today’s day and age; one that uncovers how extreme poverty begets (sometimes forced and unavoidable) neglect, which begets misery and eventually even more poverty; one that starts a node up in Zain’s family tree with his parents. Kawthar Al Haddad and Fadi Kamel Youssef star as Saoud and Selim respectively, parents to Zain, Sahar, and their other siblings that amount to a number Zain can’t even remember. It is their incompetence that brings Zain to run away from home, furious after they sell her to her husband Assaad.
Their behavior is abhorrent, and yet Labaki suffuses them with a slight nuance that never justifies it, but does color in the blanks of their upbringing, explaining why they were so ill-prepared to parent. The result is a stark picture of poverty-ridden childhood from the point of view of a boy who suffers its consequences. “Without children, you’re not a man. Your children will be your backbone,” says Selim during his son’s trial, a lesson he learned, but failed to nourish to fruition. Both Selim and Saoud grew up too impoverished to afford registering any of their children’s births at a hospital that demanded more than 100 dollars per child, to provide their innumerable kin with more than one mattress to sleep on, or to send their kids to school. Their circumstances are no excuse for their neglect, but do trace the path to their current situation: being sued by their son, he too rendered a criminal by his own atrocious circumstances. But Saoud is in denial, defending the indefensible and insisting at that very trial: “No one can judge me. I am my own judge.”
But Saoud is judged, as is her husband, by both Zain and the audience who revile them both as the conditions of Zain’s life post escape slowly unravel. Zain travels to another part of town, where he eventually meets another mom we also judge: Rahil (Yordanos Sheferaw) who goes by Tigest, a fake name to hide from authorities. Having emigrated illegally from Ethiopia, she hides her baby son Yonas (Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) in a carriage, breastfeeding him during bathroom breaks while she tries to accumulate enough money to buy them a forged citizenship.
Having emigrated illegally from Ethiopia, she has no other choice, lest she be deported back, potentially without her son. Rahil and Zain’s meeting is serendipitous, but perfect for both: Rahil needs a babysitter, and Zain needs a place to stay. But when Rahil, too, disappears, Zain is forced to take on the adult role he has too prematurely already been forced into, caring for a baby when he can barely take care of himself.
Zain is a walking contradiction, a boy whose vocabulary belies his youth—“You smell like shit, you little shit,” he tells Younas when his diaper needs changing—who chain-smokes, makes money selling fake drinks, and cares for an increasingly starved baby who needs his mother now more than ever. It is Al Rafeea’s performance that the film relies on, his charisma at once endearing and devastating, his anger at the world justified and genuine. He plays the tough guy, a kid with street smarts denoting an intelligence with a potential that may never be fully reached, simultaneously with a childlike innocence (as he uses a silver plate as a mirror to watch their neighbor’s TV) and with a gravitas that ages him beyond his unknown years. Perhaps Al Rafeea imbues his interpretation of Labaki and her husband Khaled Mazounar’s screenplay with the residual horror of his own real experiences as a Syrian boy displaced to Lebanon. He dominates over his much older co-stars, Sheferaw’s tears too expected and commonplace, Aspro’s (the smuggler who gave Rahil her new identity hopefully in exchange for her son, played by Alaa Choichnieh. “Your boy is dead before he is even born,” he warns Rahil, trying to scare her into giving her baby up for “adoption”) conniving ways more overt than subtle. In a world where children seem to be an afterthought, Al Rafeea shines through the dirt, little Bankole also seeming to emote in his babbles, mindless laughs, and yearning cries.
All Zain wants is a trace of his identity, an ID card, a birth certificate, something proving to anyone but himself that he is, in fact, an actual person who deserves more than the cards he’s been dealt. But in “Capharnaüm,” which roughly translates to “a confused jumble,” that proves nearly impossible both narratively and structurally as the title realizes itself in the making. Rahil’s family is inexplicably and unconvincingly reunited, and Zain’s future is still a mystery, his parents never truly suffering for the harm they’ve done—a combination that sets itself up for an unsatisfying ending. Thank God for Labiki, whose direction gives nuance to the too-little told stories of the mistreated children who often get left behind, her slow-moving but appropriately comedic film depicting how poverty, family (or lack thereof), and childhood come together in a harrowing tale of a boy who just wants people to know he exists.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In “Un Couteau dans le Coeur” (“Knife + Heart”), Vanessa Paradis plays Anne Pareze, a gay porn producer who’s still hung up on her ex and film editor, Loïs (Kate Moran). Anne commands a coterie of young, male porn actors, whom she scouts at bars and workplaces, enticing them with the promise of decent pay and guaranteed pleasure (and with her big doll eyes, she’s one hell of a persuader). Anne’s movies are campy and atrocious, bearing lewd titles like “Spunk in the Field” and “Homocidal” (or in French, “Le Tueur Homo,” literally, “the Homo Killer”—perhaps translation was a gift in this case), and like all stereotypical ’70s porn, present hyperbolically sexualized versions of reality. (Her flamboyant sidekick, Archibald (Nicolas Maury), often plays her in drag, wearing her platinum blonde bob and blue eyeshadow.) Anne’s production comes to a standstill, though, when a mysterious, masked serial killer begins to murder her actors one by one with a dildo-shaped knife, each killing more gruesome than the last. Anne must hatch a plan to find out the killer, or risk the lives of her other actors.
“Un Couteau dans le Coeur” tries to achieve some semblance of self-awareness, a sly wink at its own garish kitsch in neon lettering. But unlike Anne’s pornography, the film never reaches its—ahem—climax, deflating its characters into whiny caricatures and stabbing its (otherwise fun) conceit in the chest by oversaturating the film with bloodlust and saccharine emotion.
Director Yann Gonzalez starts strong with an interesting framework that equates love and death (after all, it’s the French language that likens orgasm to “the little death”). “The more I kill you, the more I love you,” a burlesque dancer proclaims melodramatically during a performance. The erotic is, without a doubt, undercut with a tinge of the morbid and macabre, even in Anne’s own videos: In vintage film, two young men kiss passionately in an empty field, while an ominous voyeur lurks in the background, watching. Gonzalez intercuts the film with grayscale, inverted-color frames of fire, stabbing, and rough sex, the looming spectre of violence to resurface in the film’s (less-than-satisfactory) ending scene. After the first five minutes, though, the spliced footage begins to feel less interestingly cryptic and more amateur, like a student film that nobody bothered to edit seriously. Even with the revelation underlying the barn footage, it still feels unjustified, a desperate grab at meaning, a pathetic scare tactic. And the silly porn movies, initially somewhat humorous, deliberately overdone, become frankly irrational. Why, after all, is Anne concerned with producing more, when her actors’ lives are at stake?
Perhaps because Anne is as unbothered by death as we are, desensitized with each exaggeratedly gory murder: one curly-haired young man tied to a bed and stabbed repeatedly in the rectum, another deepthroated with a dagger in a dark parking lot. Anne is more focused on her unrequited attempt to recharge her love affair, her unrequited passion for Loïs growing the more her lover rejects her. “When you lose yourself with another person,” she tells an unconvinced police officer, “it’s a form of love: powerful, voracious, boundless.” One gets a sense of her vehement desperation to be liked, too, by her peers, the feelings of inadequacy that stem from her dismay at Loïs’s lack of reciprocation, which Paradis plays with embarrassing conviction. “Am I still beautiful?” she asks her assistant on set, after she appears in a minor role in her own film. “Not wilted?”
If there’s anything to be salvaged from the colorful over-stimuli of “Un Couteau dans le Coeur,” it’s the visibility of the LGBTQ community, from twink to drag queen, and the liberation of their sexual expression. In Anne’s lurid skin flicks, Gonzalez creates a space for their desire and identity, in their most vivid and unabashed forms, from BDSM to role-play to drag. It’s a shame they’re systematically punished, with murder by dildo-knife—killed by the very desire they lived on.

Poland, 1949: Young Zula (Joanna Kulig) is a free-spirited teenage girl, chosen for a selective music and dance program led by Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), a composer in need of a muse. Among many auditions, Zula’s—first a harmonized duet, then a solo from a Russian film—stands out, and Wiktor is instantly enamored, both by her potential talent and her vivacity. After the chorus’s first successful performance, Zula and Wiktor share a lingering look across a crowded room, and the rest, as they say, is history. Polish director Pawel Pawlikowski checks in on various moments of Zula and Wiktor’s long, complicated history together, from Zula’s continuing career as a singer to Wiktor’s affair with a French poetess, from Warsaw to Berlin to Paris and back again. Meanwhile, European political conflict looms in the backdrop of their tumultuous romance, countries blockaded and dictatorial regimes in place, the shelling like the rumble of distant thunder. Without seeming resolute or preachy, Pawlikowski’s “Cold War” ("Zimna wojna") is a clarion call for the enduring power of love in a bleak time. Or if not love, something like it—a particular bond between two people that stays the course, Zula and Wiktor reliably brought back together, time and time again.
As Zula, Polish actress Joanna Kulig captivates, managing to capture her as authentically as a self-determined teenager as she does as a restless adult woman. Zula arrives on the doorstep of the music academy with a rep: “[My father] mistook me for my mother, so I used a knife to show him the difference,” she tells Wiktor, insouciant. Her first sexual interaction with Wiktor feels less borne out of love, and more out of adolescent experimentation, her eyes nervously open. But her spirit never disappears, only evolves and deepens, as her surroundings change from the dance halls of Poland and Germany to the dusky, smoky bars of Paris where she performs as a jazz singer. She openly flirts with other men in front of Wiktor, dances wildly on tables to American rock, even brags to Wiktor about sleeping with his friend: “Michel is great,” she says acridly, “he fucked me six times in one night.”
Her biting words impart a love too unlucky to sustain itself, one that flickers from hot to cold in the blink of an eye—or rather, in the break from one brief flash of them together to the next, the starkness of their relationship reflected in the cinematography itself. “You’re not afraid of the primitive and monotone?” asks a driver at one point, though the question is better directed at Pawlikowski himself. The film’s black and white monotony is evocative of the bleak milieu the war creates across borders, from Paris to Warsaw, the lovers equally steeped in a crippling despair—sometimes for years—as they await the next time they can be together. And as those years progress, Zula grows increasingly embittered by their too few moments together, her acidic tone belying the cheerful words she spits at Wiktor. “Everything is perfect here. It’s Paris,” she tries to convince herself. “Everything is great.”
It’s the music that attempts to attenuate the sorrow that underlies the film’s narrative and visual aesthetic. “Through this world, you will enter a world of music, song, and dance,” promises Wiktor’s colleague of the “peasant-style” dance troupe Wiktor creates at the start of “Cold War.” And he’s right: The music is simultaneously enlivening and disheartening, Zula’s dance sequences and singing performances alternatively revelatory of a yearning for Wiktor and a resentment for the sensationalized persona he tries to impose on her. “Dark eyes, you cry. You can’t be together. You can’t be together,” sings Zula, a refrain literalized in the impossibility of their star-crossed love. And when a former lover of Wiktor’s translates the song into French for Zula to sing on a record, the conversion is as hollow as Wiktor accuses Zula’s singing to be. “The pendulum killed time,” reads the French version of the song, a throughline mirroring the couple’s devolving relationship as the emotion gets lost in translation. “Que sera, sera,” laments Zula at the inevitability of their imminent undoing.
As Pawlikowski’s love story unfolds throughout the years, eventually concluding 15 years later in 1964, his characters testify to the unlikely (im)possibility of lasting passion, their enduring love surviving an unlucky number of difficulties and obstacles.  “Is this God-given love, or one whispered by the Devil?” read more lyrics. In “Cold War,” it’s both, Zula and Wiktor’s relationship too cold to warm and alleviate the friction of a Cold War that denies two Poles the right to love each other.

In two short years, without even having released a debut studio album (her first studio album, “Lost & Found,” is set to be released on June 8), 20-year-old British R&B artist Jorja Smith has launched a single-based career, collaborating with artists such as Drake, Stormzy, Khalid, Maverick Sabre, and Kali Uchis while being featured on the Black Panther soundtrack.  In 2018, Smith received the Brit Critics’ Choice Award, and her rapidly developing career shows no signs of stagnation any time soon. Smith has quickly amassed a devoted fan base, and her current tour sells out venues frequently, like her Brighton Music Hall performance on May 9. Throughout the night, Smith performed with a sleek ease as she skillfully sang pieces from her challenging repertoire.
Smith’s performance at Brighton Music Hall included songs ranging from her earlier projects to her upcoming debut album. Upon entry, Smith ascended the stage calmly and regally, and these attitudes were evident throughout her performance. Though many artists in this day and age take to the stage aiming to create a grand spectacle featuring elaborate costumes and choreography, Smith’s focus was wholly on her music as she gently swayed to the beat and danced subtly as she sang. Her interactions with her audience were also fairly minimal—after gracing the stage, Smith made a few comments to the crowd here and there, but it was evident that her main priority was her music, as Smith often appeared to be looking above or through the crowd as she focused on her singing. Unfortunately, due to the venue’s poor sound mixing, Smith’s voice was often overshadowed by the volume of her band.
At times, the unbalanced sound truly detracted from the show and made Smith quite difficult, if not impossible, to hear. However, there were moments in which Smith’s gentle crooning penetrated the air perfectly and enveloped the room with her sound. Smith, well-known for her head voice range, deftly tackled multiple octaves. Some artists struggle with translating their talent to their performances, but Smith is not one of them, as she had no discernible trouble rapidly moving up and down the scales in a live, unfiltered setting. This was shown most markedly in one of Smith’s more famous singles entitled “Let Me Down,” in which Smith showed incredible voice and breath control as she expertly performed the tricky melody over an uncomplicated piano arrangement in the background.
Smith’s front lighting cast her in an ethereal glow, which, when contrasted with a soft dark blue backlight, was spellbinding, but often clashed fiercely with jarring overhead lighting that was far too bright. On the stage with Smith were a few band members who she introduced and praised one by one to her audience. In Smith’s “Lifeboats (Freestyle),” the drummer had a fierce solo, with which Smith was able to smoothly flow. The crowd favorite was by far Smith’s most popular song, “On My Mind.” A smile stretched across Smith’s face as she slowly danced across the stage, casually belting the chorus as the audience shouted her name and occasionally waving at her friends scattered throughout the zealous crowd.
Jorja Smith’s concert at the Brighton Music House was an electrifying performance in which Smith proved that her musical prowess is not confined to her digital tracks, but rather, that she has the skill to maintain the same level of mastery in a live setting. As Smith rises steadily to prominence with the imminent release of her debut album, her May 9 performance will not be easy to forget.
