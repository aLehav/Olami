In Cecile Pin’s poignant debut novel “Wandering Souls,” Pin explores loss, grief, and the beauty of learning to live again. The novel presents the story of 16-year-old Thi Anh and her family as they escape Vung Tham, Vietnam, hoping to reach the United States. But the uncertainties of the journey alter Anh’s life forever. She becomes the head of the family, forcing her to grow up quickly and remain strong for her two younger siblings as they grapple with the weight of their parents’ sacrifice and loss. Along the way, they learn to lean on each other, heal their deepest wounds, and honor the memory of their loved ones by building their own fulfilling lives.
Pin immerses the reader into the family’s migration story from the very start of the novel, opening with a tense dinner table scene in which Anh’s parents worry about the perilous fate that awaits them. Pin’s vivid descriptions of the prepared dishes, the mother’s humming, and the haunting silence immerse the reader in the family’s anxious state as they prepare to embark on a life-changing trip across the sea to the United States. But it becomes increasingly clear that not everyone will survive.
In depicting the struggles the siblings endure day by day, Pin does a remarkable job of portraying a refugee’s experience of starting over while simultaneously recovering from the pain of losing loved ones. However, the experience of the living is not the novel’s only focus. Pin also shines light on the importance of telling the stories of those who have been silenced, and how these inherited narratives can shape the lives of those who strive to make the suffering worth it. When the three siblings arrive in London, the novel draws attention to their newfound responsibility to live out the dream their parents wished for them.
The majority of “Wandering Souls” follows the siblings as they resettle and assimilate into a new culture. Anh gives up her aspirations to pursue an education and gets a job as a seamstress instead to support her family, while trying to guide her brothers on the right path. Pin most strikingly depicts the reality of the migration experience through the story of Anh’s younger brother Minh, whose lack of hope and work ethic place a strain on his relationship with Anh. Through their heartbreaking arguments, Pin conveys the difficulty of being “tainted” with foreignness, dealing with the pressure of achieving success, and reckoning with the guilt of becoming a burden that stops a loved one from achieving the life they longed for.
Unfortunately, readers may struggle to get to know Anh outside of her role as a worried, hardworking, self-sacrificial sister. Only in rare moments do readers glimpse Anh’s frustration and regret, such as an outburst where she says to Minh, “I’ve given everything to you. I didn’t ask for this. I could have done so much more without you holding me back. You’ve ruined seven years of my life.” Although the siblings grow up and start their own families at the end of the novel, there is not enough said about Anh’s own desires and the path she takes to fulfill them.
Throughout the novel, Pin establishes an intimate and emotional tie between the reader and the characters. She accomplishes this through vivid, moving imagery in her prose, elegantly describing late nights where they hold each other tightly while reminiscing about their childhood, gruesome scenes of torturous pain on the boat, and heartbreaking revelations. One of the novel’s most impactful elements is the inclusion of the voice of Dao, a brother who passes away at the beginning of the novel. Pin alternates between chapters that tell the three siblings’ refugee story and Dao’s perspective as he watches from afar. Through this, Pin highlights the prominent Vietnamese belief that those who die away from home will, without the necessary closure, be cursed to remain a ghost on earth. As Anh’s family becomes wandering souls in the literal sense, Dao watches over his siblings, wishing he could reach out and feel their touch once more.
The novel incorporates multiple voices and storylines that intertwine with one another by the story’s end. In addition to Dao’s point of view, Pin tells the three siblings’ story through the voice of a narrator who seems to be dealing with their own form of loss and grief. Additionally, she incorporates the story of two American soldiers serving in Vietnam who are forced to terrorize the local people. Although this perspective does not seem necessary at first, it slowly reveals the injustices Anh’s family would have faced had they stayed in Vietnam. In “Wandering Souls,” Pin presents a moving depiction of the beauty that comes from stories of perseverance and the healing power that painful memories hold.

Since the presidency of George W. Bush, it’s been a tradition to invite the winners of the NCAA and NCAAW champions to the White House. For the first time in the history of the NCAA national championship game, First Lady Jill Biden invited both the winning and losing teams. Following a championship game that resulted in the mostly black LSU team, especially star player Angel Reese, receiving racialized backlash for trash talking, while Iowa star player Caitlin Clark, who is white, was praised for the same thing, it is interesting that Dr. Biden chose this year to invite both teams. Despite possible good intentions and the message of unity Dr. Biden claimed to propel, the gesture is disrespectful to both teams and women’s basketball in general.
This year’s NCAAW tournament was historic in terms of both record-breaking viewership and performances from players. Iowa’s Caitlin Clark’s playing led her to sweep every national Player of the Year award. Clark had a historic season and tournament, leading the nation in assists and triple doubles and averaging the second most points in the country. It seemed no one could compete with her stardom.
Yet, in the end, Iowa lost.
While the game itself was entertaining and worthy of discussion, most of the media attention was on LSU sophomore Angel Reese who taunted Caitlin Clark with a “You can’t see me” gesture at the end of the game, a callback to Clark doing the same taunt earlier in the tournament. While Clark herself said she didn’t have a problem with Reese’s trash talk, many internet warriors took it upon themselves to defend Clark by disparaging Reese, going as far as calling her and her teammates thugs, reflecting the larger issue of misogynoir in society that results in the victimization of white women and villainization of black women. The fact that a twenty year old black woman waving her hand in front of her face angered so many proves that.
Further, this outsized insertion by pundits of every kind into the conversation of women’s sports reeked of misogyny by assuming the women athletes from Iowa and LSU were not strong enough to handle the inherent trash talking in high level sports that men athletes consistently dish out.
Despite LSU’s win, Biden’s decision to invite both teams perpetuates a pattern of diminishing the accomplishments of women in sports, especially Black women. Angel Reese averaged 23 points and 15.4 rebounds a game this season. Flau’jae Johnson won SEC Freshman of the Year. Alexis Morris was one of the best players in the entire tournament. Jasmine Carson came off the bench and contributed to over a third of LSU’s 59 points scored in the first half. These players all had great individual performances, but more importantly, performed beautifully as a team, scoring 102 points in the championship game — the highest score ever in the history of the NCAAW tournament championship games. This should be the takeaway from the championship game. Instead, Reese’s treatment and, now, Biden’s decision threaten to eclipse it.
The matchup was entertaining and competitive and both teams deserve recognition for their hard work and skill, but the implications of Biden’s choice to invite both teams has weightier implications than the argument of inclusion. Like the fans who bullied Reese, because they thought Clark couldn’t handle trash talk, Biden’s decision to include everyone undermines the competitive nature of sports.
Reese initially declined the invitation, but, as of Thursday, LSU announced that the whole team would be in attendance. Of this announcement, Reese said, “I'm a team player. I'm going to do what's best for the team. I'm the captain."
Based on performance alone, LSU women’s basketball deserves recognition, but when taking into account the harassment they faced, it is even more important to stand behind them. In particular, the juxtaposition of hailing Caitlin Clark as classy and Angel Reese as classless, when both women took part in trash talking, is particularly damaging — highlighting the intersection of racism and misogyny in women’s sports. Ten seconds of taunting was blown out of proportion, when men are heralded for doing worse. Black women should be allowed to be just as competitive — without the double standard.
Extending the invitation to LSU alone could have been an opportunity for Jill Biden to celebrate the team, who dedicated countless hours to becoming champions and faced a disgusting amount of hate for succeeding. Jill Biden inviting both teams instead is a slap in the face to LSU and the Black women who make it what it is.

Following a stellar first episode, “Succession” kept the momentum going this week with an hour of witty one-liners, corporate intrigue, and tangled familial drama culminating in an intense and emotional confrontation between Logan Roy (Brian Cox) and his children.
The premiere started out with a bang, following the rebellious Roy children — still stinging from their father’s betrayal — as they successfully snatched Logan’s acquisition of Pierce Global Media (PGM) out from under his nose. Tom Wambsgans (Matthew Macfadyen) and Greg Hirsch (Nicholas Braun) are themselves in a more prominent yet still somewhat precarious position after siding with the venerable Logan Roy. Siobhan “Shiv” Roy (Sarah Snook) and Tom’s marriage is quietly falling apart, Logan is increasingly emotionally detached from his family and taking a cynical view on mortality, and the siblings are finally working together in a fragile yet budding alliance.
As always, “Succession” perfectly balances drama and comedy, from sharp banter exchanged between the three siblings, whose newfound camaraderie is threatened by their own conflicting motivations (and of course, their remaining and varying degrees of filial loyalty), to the hilarious Greg and Tom dynamic in which Tom continues to bully and boss Greg around, in this episode delegating to him the unpleasant task of dealing with Logan’s assistant and wannabe TV host Kerry Castellabate (Zoë Winters).
The episode opens with the fallout from the siblings’ acquisition of PGM. Logan has taken it in stride, instead shifting to focus on his global news broadcasting service ATN since Waystar Royco is about to be sold to the icy Swede Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgård). The siblings analyze a PGM news clip with sardonic ease, only for Shiv to be interrupted by a disturbing call relating to her divorce.
The theme then cues with all of these tantalizing plot devices laid out — corporate battles, Logan’s newfound interest in ATN, and the siblings’ partnership starting to fray under pressures from outside forces.
This episode featured superb acting per usual from the entire cast, with a particularly spectacular performance from Brian Cox, who expertly plays Logan with his typical brusque and direct manner. In the second episode, Logan has decided to take a more active role in ATN that will remain his after Matsson buys out Waystar Royco. Logan marches into ATN and prowls about the newsroom, “terrifyingly moseying” as if “Santa Claus were a hitman,” according to Greg.
After pushing Tom and news mogul Cyd Peach (Jeannie Berlin) around for a bit, Logan delivers a fierce speech about his hopes for the future of ATN, eliciting cheers from the entire newsroom. He is powerful, provocative, and inspiring, and the viewer can plainly see how his leadership is so much more effective than that of Tom or his three children, who have all fancied themselves head of his company throughout the show. There is something almost Machiavellian about this scene, as Logan masterfully demonstrates how the cutthroat leader can succeed by wielding both love and fear.
Connor (Alan Ruck) and Willa (Justine Lupe) also got more screen time this episode, when a dejected Connor crashes his siblings’ scheming after a disastrous wedding rehearsal dinner. In the past, Connor’s character has been relegated to the role of comic relief, so viewers may enjoy seeing him as a more serious character in this season, as opposed to being the family laughing stock — although he still provides plenty of entertaining content.
The writing, as usual, is fast-paced, tight, and brilliant, with all the actors performing at their very best. “Succession” truly excels in its group scenes, when all of the complex relationships that have been woven together and pulled taut episode by episode, season by season, are laid out before the viewer in an intricate, tangled knot of familial drama.
Logan’s surprise display of empathy as he attempts to apologize to his children for last season’s betrayal shakes the siblings to their core even as they rebuff his apologies, adding another layer of complexity to the family dynamic that is so well-executed by the show writers. And in the very last scene, when Roman (Kieran Culkin) returns to his father again, viewers understand his desperate desire to be loved.
“Succession” continues to masterfully explore dysfunctional family dynamics, delving into the nuances of love, trust, anger, betrayal, and the whole spectrum of human emotion. Episode 2 was just as great as the first at diving fearlessly into the profoundly complicated nature of love, and the ending leaves viewers hungry for more as a haunting rendition of the theme plays, deftly evoking the grand yet sorrowful fate of the Roy family.

Atlanta rapper, singer, and songwriter J.I.D enveloped the House of Blues in “Surround Sound” on March 9 for a sold out show in Boston. His worldwide “Luv Is 4ever Tour,” in which he performs alongside longtime collaborator Smino, cements the rapper’s ascension to the top of rap history. With 2022’s critically acclaimed “The Forever Story” under his belt, no longer is the Dreamville rhymer an up-and-comer: J.I.D is now officially a household name.
Sporting his signature locs and a satin pajama set, J.I.D entered the stage in style. His southern twang brought an immediate sense of familiarity; especially with phrases such as “you’re all part of my ecosystem.” J.I.D remained ever so humble, constantly thanking the fans that tweeted and shared “The Forever Story,” contributing to his latest album’s success. Such affirmations and heartfelt messages were abundant additions to the tracks, emanating a sense of unity and homecoming throughout the venue. The stage design reinforced this theme, as heart-shaped symbolism littered the LED screens.
The setlist overflowed with themes of community. In dedicating songs like “Bruddanem” to the crowd, J.I.D took time to make the audience feel like part of his extended family. This theme of sentimentality he cultivated worked well to tie in the thematic lyrics of previous albums like “Take your heart, don't let me break it in two” in ““Workin Out” from “DiCaprio 2.” The candid storytelling didn't stop there. Lyrics like “Are you really in it for the arts or the image?” in “Stars” paid homage to his humble beginnings, that continue to stick with him.
“If I dedicate one to the bruddanem you already know I have to give one for the sistanem,” J.I.D teased before breaking into an honest rendition of “Sistanem.” The heavy bassline in the outro echoed around the venue in a moment of silence lent itself to “Kody Blu 31.” Kody was the name of J.I.D’s friend's son, who died at an early age. J.I.D took his time in performing the most important song of the album, executing the mellow flow and raw emotions behind the lyrics “keep swanging on” with the ease of a seasoned performer.
Not all moments in the concert were heavy. As a matter of fact, most of the concert was spent in celebration of the high energy, rapid fire verses J.I.D is best known for. From the dynamic chorus of “Dance Now” to the heavy 808s in “G.O.M.D,” there wasn’t a dull moment in the set. Multiple mosh pits formed immediately after the first notes of Aretha Franklin’s sample on “Surround Sound,” — it’s safe to say, the crowd went berserk for the beat drop. J.I.D maintained that intense atmosphere with chants of “unite the pits” until Smino came out. The lyrics of “Stick” were displayed on the screen, working to highlight just how fast the artists are capable of rapping bars. J.I.D turned up the knobs on intensity some more with “151 Rum,” getting the crowd going with the chant “Fuck yeah Jiddy.” In between these demanding performances, J.I.D still had the energy to finesse some freestyles — showing off his undeniable talent when it comes to spitting bars.
With such unparalleled skill and energetic delivery, it’s no wonder that chants of “We love you Jiddy” echoed throughout the House of Blues as concertgoers exited the venue.

Body Rolls. A performance by the Harvard Whistler’s Society. Nicki Minaj. A laughing skit and hip-hop routine to 21 Savage x Metro Boomin’s “Runnin.” What do these seemingly unrelated qualities have in common? All were features of Harvard’s Expressions’ Spring 2023 Showcase: “The X Factor.”
The Harvard Expressions Dance Company is a fully student-operated hip-hop dance group that’s been on campus for over forty years. Each semester, the organization hosts a dance showcase featuring over a dozen dances all choreographed and performed by undergraduates at the College. With two emcees, this year’s showcase also featured performances from the Harvard Whistler’s Society as well as the Harvard Lowkeys. Collectively, the showcase serves attitude and hip-hop moves to some of the top rap and hip-hop hits.
Aditi Kona ’26 shared her reasons for attending the showcase this semester.
“So I went first semester for the first one to support a friend but I think that it’s a really niche, very cool part of Harvard like dance, art, and media, and something that I’m not exposed to a lot so I want to get more into it,” Kona said.
As Expressions is one of the most prominent performing art groups at Harvard, Kona also spoke about the arts scene at Harvard.
“I think Harvard puts a lot of money into STEM, Econ, and Gov and maybe not as much attention into dance and they do not pub it as much although they definitely should,” said Kona.
The hip-hop group is open to students of all years and experience levels. Layla Chaaraoui ’26 who joined Expressions in her freshman fall spoke about her experience in the dance company.
“I have been dancing since I was seven years old and hip-hop has always been my favorite style of dance so Harvard Expressions was something I actually seeked out before I came to Harvard,” said Chaaraoui. “I was looking for different hip-hop groups and companies and Expressions came up. And I absolutely loved what they did, loved their style, and I loved their vibe. I absolutely knew this was something I wanted to be a part of so I joined it last semester and loved it and I did it again this semester and loved it again.”
Chaaraoui also shared the communal passion for hip-hop she continuously feels amongst Expressions members.
“I think it’s a great community and I just love getting to dance. Hip-hop is my favorite style so I love being able to dance with so many other people also passionate about it. And I love that they accept all levels and backgrounds. So, it is just a really fun group to be a part of and it has really helped me find my space here,” Chaaraoui said.
The Expressions dances are fully choreographed by students. May Jung ’25 started with the company last year and is now a Direx, an executive board position of the company who organizes and leads company productions. This year, she led the NewRex dance, allowing incoming dancers with less experience to perform in the showcase.
“We oversee the entire performance and the company,” Jung said.
“For example, my role was taking care of the Directors’ piece which is a piece for beginner dancers to the hip-hop scene and just anyone who is learning dance for the first time or wants to like to take it back, take it slow,” said Jung.
“Another cool feature of our Directors’ piece is whoever wants to get a taste of choreographing for the first time can submit either a few seconds of a choreo piece or an entire 1-2 minute choreo for a Directors’ piece. So, I am in charge of that part for the Directors’ team. So I was a choreographer as well as a director for this show.”
The spring showcase put on by Expressions welcomed all types of performing artists from whistlers, to acapella singers, and most importantly, hip-hop dancers. The company puts on one showcase every semester, allowing students to fully express themselves through a variety of songs with hard basses, dabble in choreography, and even lead their own dances as members of the executive board.

If one thing is certain, “the record” is not just any record. boygenius released their debut album, “the record” on March 31, packaging a myriad of stories and sensations surrounding monumental heartbreak into 42 minutes of indie gold. Bandmates Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, and Lucy Dacus expand their earlier work with fresh takes on themes of guilt, identity, trust, and honesty in what is their best release yet.
In their first full-length album, boygenius combines the strengths of each band member to convey complex perspectives on love which eventually resolve themselves into an acceptance of self and reality. The emotional intricacy of “the record” directly relies on their seamless melding of each musician’s distinct lyricism and musical style, demonstrating major growth from their self-titled album released in 2018.
Bridgers takes the lead with the third track, “Emily I’m Sorry,” narrating a desperate and guilt-ridden apology to a lover. Released as a single in January of 2023, “Emily I’m Sorry” was an impressive teaser for the rest of “the record.” Baker’s strong guitar riffs from track two are replaced with the ambient layered instrumentation characteristic of Bridgers’s distinct “underwater” sound. This successfully plays to Bridgers’s personal strengths and sets the stage for the rest of the album’s masterpiece.
Bridgers begins the song caught in a lie meant to impress her lover, and initially tries to reason. As the song continues, Bridgers reveals that she has completely lost herself trying to love someone who cannot be appeased. Bridgers continues harping on her failing relationship and ends the song with a final attempt at bargaining: “Emily, forgive me, can we / Make it up as we go along? / I’m twenty-seven and I don’t know who I am / But I know what I want,” Bridgers sings. The lyrics, backed by a soft harmony from Baker and Dacus, detail the narrator’s gut-wrenching realization that they have unintentionally hurt the person they care about most and rejected their own authentic self in the process.
Dacus presents a different take on what it means to be understood in the fourth song, “True Blue.” A catchy guitar line and drums along with background vocals in a major key portray a positive outlook: Dacus sings, “And it feels good to be known so well / I can’t hide from you like I hide from myself.” For many, love is most deeply felt through wholly understanding another person, but Dacus reminds us that this vulnerability does not come without risk. “You already hurt my feelings three times / In the way only you could,” the singer relates.
The folk elements in “Cool About It” reminisce on the sounds from boygenius’s first release with equally devastating lyrics. The women return to their patterned songwriting, allowing each musician to lead their own verse within the song to develop a well-rounded depiction of the different forms of pain that manifest from hiding one’s true feelings. Baker opens with a desire to move on from a past-lover, by whatever means necessary: “Telling myself I can always do without it / Knowing that it probably isn’t true.” Dacus repeats this in a different context, singing about the desire for closure and an apology from a past lover. The background vocals dip off as Bridgers closes the song, concealing overwhelming feelings of love and concern for her partner: “I can walk you home and practice method acting / I’ll pretend bein’ with you doesn’t feel like drowning.” Each interpretation of this pain is different, but the repeated rhythm and guitar melody connect their verses into a cohesive whole.
The following tracks expand on depictions of fear and uncertainty in love and relationships, closing out with some of boygenius’s most devastating songs. As Dacus sings “We’re In Love,” she returns to themes of conditional love and ties it all together in the ultimate love ballad for the anxious minded. Soft piano and acoustic guitar support her heart-wrenching vocals, providing a gentle accompaniment that doesn’t overshadow the fragility of her voice. “You could absolutely break my heart / That’s how I know we’re in love,” she sings. Though the songs are not directly related, the narrator seems to have finally accepted that the nature of being fully invested in a relationship risks the possibility of being hurt.
If the previous songs on “the record” have not emotionally ruined listeners by now, boygenius finishes with “Letter To An Old Poet” — a song which promises emotional devastation from the first lyric. For older fans of boygenius, the tune is all too familiar. The band repurposes the melody and lyrics of their song “Me & My Dog,” replacing devastating lines with a hopeful approach. Originally, boygenius expressed their desperation for closure and inner peace. “I wanna be emaciated / I wanna hear one song without thinking of you,” the end of the song plays. Contrastingly, in “Letter To An Old Poet,” Bridgers presents an alternate take that reflects an optimistic desire to seek inner peace separate from a toxic lover: “I wanna be happy / I’m ready to walk into my room without lookin’ for you.” Though the women acknowledge that they have not yet found this closure, they are determined to achieve it for their own sake.
The maturation of Baker, Bridgers, and Dacus in their individual careers equipped them with the experience and refined talent needed to come together and produce an album that showcases their unified musical genius. The debut album reflects boygenius’s growth while staying true to their original sound, supplying references to their previous work that will be appreciated by old fans. For listeners new to the band, “the record” provides a look into the wide spectrum of musicality that the women have mastered.

In a world of hectic work culture, where each person is vying to reach some version of success, it is not often that our role models remind us to slow down and take stock of our lives to change them for the better.
Dr. Anthony Chin-Quee, however, does just that in his memoir, “I Can’t Save You.”
Given his lifelong interest in performing and storytelling, Chin-Quee’s masterful and poignant recounting of his time in medical residency comes as no surprise. This memoir is Chin-Quee’s public debut into the writing world, and his story touches on how the trials of his experience in medical school and residency urged him to prioritize his happiness.
Chin-Quee’s memoir details transformative moments in his life, from graduating from medical school to completing his medical residency. He writes about the entire spectrum of a doctor’s experience, from the exhilaration of seeing patients on his own for the first time to the racial, mental, and physical struggles of residency. Chin-Quee is unafraid of shying away from the truth of the rigors of medical training.
However, unlike most authors of medical memoirs, Chin-Quee deliberately chose not to promote the overly optimistic message that “despite [how] hard it gets, medicine will always pull you through,” he said. Instead, Chin-Quee focuses on how his struggles in residency challenged him to confront his past and find a way to reclaim joy in his life.
In an interview with The Harvard Crimson, Chin-Quee described his inspiration for writing his memoir, citing a lack of medical non-fiction writing that mirrored the truths of his own experiences in medical school and residency.
“If I’m gonna tell this story, which I think would be helpful for folks who come through this,” said Chin-Quee, “then I gotta be honest about what it is and how it’s been, even if it means I would never get another job in medicine again.”
Chin-Quee praised the inspirational quality of physician memoirs and works of fiction that focus on medical school, but he felt that the depictions of medical school and residency did not match his experience. Despite growing up with a love of reading fiction and telling stories, Chin-Quee did not want to fictionalize his story by ascribing his experience to a made-up character.
“If I were [to do] this under an assumed name, there’s no bravery in that for me,” he said.
His memoir aims to highlight the not-so-glamorous side of medicine, though his main purpose is not to warn his readers away from the profession.
Chin-Quee uses this work to share the reality of the messiness of the medical training experience and to speak to those who, like him, felt alone in their experience. In his book, Chin-Quee speaks candidly about residency’s effects on his mental health, discussing his struggles with depression throughout residency. Chin-Quee even delves into mental health struggles in his family history, exploring them in light of how medicine’s efforts to drive him to “rock bottom” allowed him to recognize the ways in which he needed to take care of his mental health.
“The way in which the medical journey destroyed a lot of parts of me that I thought were really important,” said Chin-Quee, “ended up being what allowed me to start over from scratch.”
Chin-Quee reflected on how during his time in residency, he stifled the parts of himself that were still important to him. His interests in singing, acting, dancing, and writing — some of which he pursued at Harvard through Ghungroo, a capella, and CityStep — were muted in the name of facing his responsibilities.
During a depressive episode in residency, Chin-Quee decided to recover those lost parts of himself. Chin-Quee said that he decided to “keep track of moments that [he] realized were sticking with [him]” by journaling his experiences. Chin-Quee describes how creating art again catalyzed a return to his past joys. These journaled moments acted as a foundation for what would later become “I Can’t Save You.”
In an effort to continue the recovery of his past passions, Chin-Quee decided to include various forms of art in his memoir. After compiling these mementos from residency, Chin-Quee asked himself, “How do I use the art to help me tell an important story?”
“The most important thing I learned was that you’ll just be surviving unless you really learn to love yourself,” said Chin-Quee when asked about the biggest lesson he took away from his residency experience.
Though “I Can’t Save You” might appear to be a typical medical memoir, this book is an urgent reminder to prioritize and cherish the joys in life beyond one’s professional future.

In college, Mina Le wanted to be an “Anna Wintour-type person.” Today, though she may not be the Editor-in-Chief of “VOGUE,” she sits at the helm of a distinctly Millenial/Gen Z fashion empire of her own — and arguably boasts a superior signature look. Dressed in opulent ensembles that she describes as a mix between regencycore, cottagecore, 1980s New Romantic, and the occasional “sleazy corporate wear,” Le dishes out an equally unique combination of fashion and pop culture commentary across her social media platforms that keep her “beautiful doves,” her affectionate moniker for her fanbase, well-fed.
Le launched her eponymous YouTube channel in 2020, and has since amassed over one million subscribers, signed with IMG Models, and started a podcast called “High Brow,” the title a playful nod to Le’s iconic pencil-thin eyebrows. She is modest about her explosive success, attributing it to a combination of fortunate timing — her first videos were posted during the pandemic, when “people were kicked out of their jobs and were spending a lot of time home … watching things online” — and a lack of competition in her YouTube commentary niche at the time she began her channel, though she says that this genre has since expanded into “quite a category” on YouTube.
Le asserts that her first videos were inspired by the fashion history content she consumed to pass the time during the pandemic, not from any desire to become an influencer. “I didn’t do it with the intention of creating a career for myself,” Le said. “I loved watching that content, and I was like, ‘I need more.’ But there was no more, because I consumed all of it! So I had to make my own.”
Armed with her own considerable fashion knowledge and her New York Public Library membership — “Go Library!” Le said, laughing — Le decided to research and film a video about the historical accuracy of Disney Princess dresses, an idea she credits to the Glamour YouTube channel. The video, which went viral, was Le’s breakout piece; almost overnight, her subscribers climbed from 600 to 60,000, to Le’s own surprise.
Le’s early days in the public eye were challenging. Trying to navigate the industry without the help of a management team made her feel like she “didn’t know what [she was] doing.” During this time, she relied on other fashion and commentary YouTubers — a community she describes as “very supportive and not competitive at all” — to make sense of sponsorships, strategies for platform growth, and the notoriously mysterious YouTube algorithm.
However, social media hasn’t always been a positive place for Le. She likened seeing discussions about herself on social media to “jumpscares” that only increase with her growing success. “I’ve realized that there are spaces on the internet that I don’t want to be in,” Le said. “People have all the right to say whatever they want about me, but it’s in my control whether I expose myself to that.”
Le is cognizant of the amount of time she spends online, and she believes that allowing herself to be “bored” and spend time away from social media has been beneficial for both her mental health and creative process.
Though Le’s videos primarily focus on fashion history and pop culture trends, she often integrates nuanced political and historical commentary into her analysis. At first, this combination seems unexpected, but Le confidently maintains that “fashion has always been political,” effortlessly connecting the sumptuary laws of the 15th and 16th century — which banned the lower classes from wearing certain items of clothing — to today’s fascination with “old money aesthetics” to illustrate her point.
How did Le amass such an encyclopedic knowledge of fashion history?
“JSTOR or Semantic Scholar,” she said. “I’ve worked with librarians in the past, who helped me to curate research guides.”
Le loves research: Her favorite video she’s ever made was one that focused on modernism in interior design trends, simply because it gave her the opportunity to branch out of her primary field and discover something new.
Similar to her research process, Le’s personal wardrobe is a meticulous labor of love. She carefully combs through New York vintage shows and websites like Depop, Vestier, and eBay to find new items. Sustainability and vintage pieces are a particular priority for Le, who likes to collect “items for every decade, from a historical standpoint,” even if they don’t align with her curated aesthetic. “If you ever get invited to a themed decade party, I’m your girl,” Le joked.
With her collection of clothing from the past, Mina Le welcomes uncertainty in her future. She recognizes that content creation, which sees platforms emerge and die out in the blink of an eye, is a particularly fickle and ever-changing field. “I have no idea where I’m going to be in ten years,” she said.
“I’ve thought about what person I want to be,” she added. “It’s good to be ambitious, but it’s also good to be flexible.”
Whatever the future brings, Le’s unique and well-researched repertoire of fashion history and cultural commentary will certainly remain engaging for years to come.

True to its name, psychedelic rock was born from a counterculture of radical experiments in experience. As a new generation pushed the boundaries of experience through hallucinogenic drugs, they also challenged, extended, and distorted the parameters of music. Protesting against the constraints of radio-friendliness, the psychedelic scene saw long-haired, free-spirited hippies exploring long-form, free-style instrumentation. Innovative twists on traditional musical elements and production, a renaissance of bygone instruments, and the introduction of non-western musical influences have facilitated a distorted, psychedelic experience for generations of fans.
From the Human Be-In to Haight Ashbury’s Summer of Love to the Monterey Pop Festival, the California scene — and its British Invasion — both popularized and monopolized much of the psychedelic movement. Californian psychedelic music sprouted from an existing substrate of political momentum and rock experiments like surf and folk rock, a founding framework which often deposited topical themes in vibrant compositions. The East Coast scene, centered in New York, took on a more avant-garde, grungy tone as heard in the discography of The Velvet Underground. Across the Atlantic, the London-centered British scene, led by groups like Pink Floyd, explored more whimsical and improvisational threads of the psychedelic.
Ready to get hooked on psychedelic rock? Take a trip through western psychedelia with some key tracks from three epicenters of the genre!
The California Scene
“White Rabbit” – Jefferson Airplane (1967)
Welcome to the entrance of the psychedelic rock rabbit hole. A creeping, subtly building rock riff on Alice’s titular wonderland, “White Rabbit” has come to represent the zeitgeist of the California psychedelic movement. Let Grace Slick’s iconic soaring vocals carry you — and remember what the dormouse said.
“Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out” — Dr. Timothy Leary (1966)
Yes — there’s a track credited to former Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary used as the soundtrack to a documentary of the same name, and it’s exactly what you’d expect. Turn on, tune in, and be transported by the ebb and flow of this track’s free-form veena and tabla instrumental homage to Leary’s iconic quip.
“Purple Haze” – Jimi Hendrix (1967)
Jimi Hendrix lives up to his reputation as one of the most influential electric guitarists in “Purple Haze.” Hendrix’s innovative guitar and surrealistic lyrics flirt around a metronomic syntax, punctuated by dramatic stop-time moments.
“Sit With the Guru” – Strawberry Alarm Clock (1968)
How many tomorrows can you see? Sit with the guru in this blissful recapitulation of a meditative session to find out. The transcendental psychedelic track leans deep into elements of surf rock à la The Beach Boys, strung together by distinctive falsetto harmonies before fading out in a disorienting cacophony of joyful noise.
“Riders on the Storm” – The Doors (1971)
It was a dark and stormy night — and Ray Manzarek’s extended keyboard solo shimmers through this song’s rainy sound effects, itself at times morphing into raindrop-like cascades. Jim Morrison haunts his own brooding vocals in a ghostly whispered overdub, perhaps an ominous portent that this would be the last track he recorded before his untimely death.
The British Scene
“Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds” – The Beatles (1967)
Though John Lennon denies any connection between his song’s initials and those of hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), the lethargic lyrical imagery returns to a favorite inspiration of psychedelic music: Lewis Carroll’s “Alice in Wonderland.” The genre’s deployment of non-traditional and non-western musical elements is also well-represented on the track, the song’s instrumentation supported by a lowrey organ and Indian tanpura.
“Breathe (In the Air)” – Pink Floyd (1973)
This second track of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” emphatically dissipates the tension of the previous track — “Speak to Me” — which carries over into the first seconds of “Breathe.” Refracted glissandos enabled by guitarist David Gilmour’s liberal application of a guitar phaser swirl around marching, breathy vocals, enveloping the song’s chilly lyrics in a radiant warmth.
“Om” – The Moody Blues (1968)
Representative of the raga rock substyle notable for its heavy Indian musical influence, this serene composition features a unique blend of instrumentation and vocals. Mellotron, flute, sitar, tabla, and cello dance with meditative, lofty harmonies. For best results, listen first to “The Word” — a spoken word track which fades into “Om” and establishes the premise for its lyrics.
“Tales of Brave Ulysses” – Cream (1967)
This track’s guitar is granted a humanoid voice of its own through Eric Clapton’s extensive (and first) use of the newly invented wah-wah pedal, accentuating the repetitive descending bass. For all the instrumentation’s experimental psychedelic elements, the lyrical substance takes on a neoclassical feel in its curation of a vivid exhibition of scenes from the song’s Greek tragedy namesake.
The East Coast Scene
“All Tomorrow’s Parties” – The Velvet Underground, Nico (1967)
Andy Warhol’s favorite of The Velvet Underground’s discography, this track again typifies psychedelic rock's embrace of non-traditional instrumentation. Nico’s unflinching lyric delivery cuts through an energetic instrumental composition inspired by pioneering composer Terry Riley. Marked by its reliance on tone clusters, the song’s undergirding piano motif makes use of prepared piano — a paperclip chain was intertwined with the piano strings to achieve its distinctive sound.
“Riddles and Fairytales” – Bohemian Vendetta (1968)
This curiously jaunty composition is the psychedelic equivalent of the theme song of Nickelodeon’s “Fairly OddParents.” And psychedelic it is; distorted electric guitar, a zealous set of drums, and a simple yet potent oscillating bassline celebrate bizarre lyrics. The track demands not a solution to its riddles, but an embrace of its absurdities.
“(We Ain’t Got) Nothin’ Yet” – The Blues Magoos (1966)
“Nothin’ Yet” clings to its prominent syncopated bass — a readily imitated riff which echoed around the rock community in large part due to this track’s chart success. The iconic bass program is the blueprint from which the rest of the song springs, from its lively instrumentation to its distanced, twangy vocals.

For decades, The New York Times has been a reliable source of news and information for millions of readers around the globe. But in recent years, it's also become known for its addictive puzzle games: Crosswords, Wordle, Spelling Bee, and others have gained widespread traction among players of all ages and backgrounds, becoming cultural phenomena unto themselves. But what does this growth in popularity say about the value that society places on mental agility and intellectual pursuits?
These games continue to fascinate readers of all ages, reflecting a cultural shift towards rewarding mental aptitude and intellectual pursuits. Younger generations especially are drawn to these fast-paced challenges, while appreciating The New York Times as an epicenter of intellectualism and quality journalism. By exploring the history and rise in popularity of these NYT games, one can shed insight into society's shifting values and priorities, as well as why these puzzles remain such fun and timeless ways for readers to challenge their minds.
Puzzle games have a centuries-long legacy in American culture, from jigsaw puzzles that originated in 1760 to the Rubik’s Cube invented in 1974. As newspapers became more prevalent in the 19th and 20th centuries, puzzle games began appearing within their pages — and The New York Times quickly became a leader in this space. In 1942, The Times’s crossword puzzle became a national obsession and is now considered an American cultural treasure.
Since then, the publication has significantly expanded its puzzle selection to include a diverse selection of games tailored to different skill levels and interests. Recently, newer games such as Spelling Bee and Wordle have taken the puzzle world by storm, drawing in a younger generation of puzzlers with their fast-paced, modern format. Through these puzzle games, The New York Times has continued to evolve in order to keep up with the modern age while staying true to its core values of intellectual curiosity and a commitment to producing quality content.
The exponential rise of puzzle games like Wordle and crossword puzzles can be attributed to several factors. One primary driver is the rise of the internet and social media, which has fostered a culture that values problem-solving skills and critical thinking more than ever before. People are spending more and more time online, immersed in complex, thought-provoking content. Thus, many may turn towards puzzles as a way to stimulate their minds and practice problem-solving abilities.
The popularity of these NYT games reflects the paper’s well-established and unique identity as a publication that values intellectual rigor. The crossword puzzle, in particular, has an extensive history at the Times and is widely considered an American cultural institution. By providing readers with exciting puzzle games like Spelling Bee and Wordle, the Times can engage readers in a fun and rewarding way while reinforcing its place as the primary source of information and ideas within the cultural zeitgeist of America. Through puzzle games, the Times continues to solidify its reputation as a reliable source of news and entertainment for the cerebral and cosmopolitan young reader, deepening its connections to those who share these values.
Puzzle games have seen a meteoric rise in popularity, particularly among younger readers, reflecting an overall cultural shift towards rewarding intellectual pursuits and mental sharpness. Recent studies have demonstrated that millennials and Generation Z are more interested in engaging with content that stimulates their minds and challenges them to think critically. This shift is likely driven by several factors, including the increasing value of education and an awareness of mental wellness. Furthermore, people today live on-the-go more frequently, so finding ways to challenge their minds and stay sharp becomes progressively more important. Puzzle games, with their combination of logic and creativity, offer the ideal way to do just that. By capitalizing on this trend, The New York Times has been able to attract a new audience of readers who seek engaging, intellectually stimulating content.
Social media has also contributed to the rising popularity of New York Times puzzle games, with apps like TikTok offering users a platform to celebrate both their victories and setbacks. Users such as @dailywordle and @kennyhaller have amassed over 1.1 million and 300,000 followers respectively by uploading videos of themselves solving the latest Wordle or crossword puzzle. Games have fostered a broader sense of community that has only served to popularize them further, and this sense of community has only served to popularize them further. Even educators have joined in on the fun, with one video showing a teacher using Wordle to engage her elementary students in an educational activity. These viral videos have given rise to an even wider audience for these games, further cementing their cultural significance and reinforcing their status as sources of mental stimulation and symbols of modern intellectualism.
The growing popularity of puzzle games in The New York Times indicates a broader trend towards a greater appreciation for intellectualism and critical thinking among readers, especially younger generations. These games provide an enjoyable way for readers to engage with the publication, helping to maintain its reputation as a bastion for intellectualism and quality journalism. Moreover, its potential to educate and engage readers is immense; as our society becomes increasingly focused on mental prowess and intellectual pursuits, puzzle games will likely remain an important part of the cultural landscape for the foreseeable future.

Isaac Pelayo, a Los Angeles-based artist, has become an integral part of the Griselda Records brand — the gritty underground hip-hop collective led by Westside Gunn. With a unique visual style that has helped define the group’s aesthetic, Pelayo’s work has become synonymous with the music it represents. From album covers like Armani Caesar’s “The Liz 2” to exclusive merchandise and art exhibitions, Pelayo’s contributions to Griselda’s success are both undeniable and far-reaching.
Their journey began when Westside Gunn discovered Pelayo’s artwork via Instagram in 2017. After seeing Pelayo’s piece featuring 2Pac with a third eye, Gunn reached out to the young artist, initially intending to purchase the work. However, their relationship quickly evolved into a creative partnership, with Pelayo becoming the go-to artist for Griselda. “I started painting in early 2016, and I dropped out of college, halfway into that year,” Pelayo said. “I painted every day for a whole year. Come 2017 I painted the Tupac portrait and every year have just gotten more and more aggressive with it.”
Throughout the years, Pelayo has become a mainstay at Griselda events, signing merchandise and prints for eager fans. His art has also been exhibited at Gunn's curated art exhibitions, such as Vivian At The Art Basel in 2021, Bochella 2022, and last May’s WWVD in Chicago, dedicated to the late Virgil Abloh. These exhibitions have allowed Pelayo to further solidify his place within the Griselda brand and connect with their audience on a deeper level. Now, Pelayo is one of the leading street artists in the world, displaying his work in galleries across the country and selling many of his pieces for top market prices.
Pelayo’s art is deeply rooted in his personal history. According to Pelayo, art served as an escape and a source of balance during difficult times in his childhood. “I kind of was forced to grow up fairly quickly,” the artist said. “Art was the one thing that I could escape to. It was really just me, some empty sheets of paper and some pencils or whatever I could find to draw with. If I was feeling anxious, or if I was feeling like my anxiety was high or I felt uncomfortable, I would just draw.
His father, also an artist, played a significant role in exposing Pelayo to the art world while allowing him to develop independently as an artist. “There’s a misconception that my dad taught me how to draw, and taught me how to paint,” Pelayo said. “That’s not true at all. What is true is that he exposed me to the art world by taking me to galleries.”
Pelayo’s latest solo show, “The New Renaissance,” which debuted last September, showcased his most ambitious work yet: over 70 pieces, including sculptures. The inspiration for the show came from Pelayo’s transformative month-long trip to Europe, where he soaked up the works of the masters. “I was just floored by the artwork that I was seeing out there,” Pelayo said. “I cried more times in one day than I can think of throughout my whole life. Literally crying because I just couldn't hold it together to understand how unreal these paintings are in person.”
Shepard Fairey, the legendary street artist responsible for designing Barack Obama’s “HOPE” campaign poster, also played a significant role in Pelayo’s artistic development. According to Pelayo, Fairey advised the young artist to embrace imperfections in his work. This advice led Pelayo to create one of his most iconic pieces, the smiley-faced Mona Lisa for Westside Gunn’s “Pray For Paris.”
“When [Gunn] put that out, a tidal wave took place, where people responded to it like it was the start of a whole new movement,” Pelayo said. “It just exploded and I ran with it.”
At 26 years old, Pelayo has already achieved more acclaim than some artists achieve in a lifetime, with names like Diddy having pieces in their collections and prices for his art and merchandise constantly rising. Despite all of his success, the artist remains hard at work.
“During 2020, I created between 100 and 200 paintings,” Pelayo said. “In 2021, I probably doubled that. Last year, I think I doubled that again. It’s been more and more work and trying new things. Now I’m using different mediums where I incorporate a lot of pastel and spray paint, instead of just oil painting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its 85 years, the Harvard Study of Adult Development — the longest running longitudinal study on adult happiness — has found that there is a clear answer to what makes a joyful and fulfilling life. In the first few pages of their recent book, “The Good Life: Lessons from the World's Longest Scientific Study of Happiness,” the study’s co-directors Dr. Robert J. Waldinger ’73 and Dr. Marc Schulz plainly state, “Good relationships keep us healthier and happier. Period.”
In “The Good Life,” Waldinger and Schulz use a rich array of case studies from the Harvard Study and their own experiences to make a simple, yet life-changing finding. The authors challenge the common assumption that making relationships is an innate human skill that can be left in the background. Instead, through studying participants’ rich life experiences they convincingly demonstrate that personal connections are not byproducts of life experiences, but their driving force.
The Harvard Study of Adult Development began in 1938, with the intention of “investigating not what made people sick but what made them thrive.” The original 724 subjects were young men and boys from the Boston area chosen from two populations: 268 were Harvard undergraduates and 456 were from Boston’s inner-city and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Subjects agreed to answer a thorough set of survey and interview questions every two years.
Collected over hundreds of lifetimes, the biennial check-ins constructed detailed portraits of participants’ health using emotional wellbeing surveys, medical tests, and biographical interviews. These interviews are prominently featured in “The Good Life,” and to powerful effect. The authors vividly describe intimate conversations that participants had with researchers and loved ones, in which they express vulnerable reflections that affirm the importance of relationships. In one moving example from the book, an elderly couple expressed to each other that their greatest fear is the other’s death and the loneliness that would ensue.
This focus on personal stories makes “The Good Life” a compelling read. Unlike other books in the self-help genre that seek to address today’s historically high levels of loneliness with statistics, psychological jargon, and to-do lists, “The Good Life” lets the rich life stories of the study speak for themselves.
Within a few hundred pages, readers see dozens of rich lives unfold, each of which illuminates the complexities of building and maintaining healthy relationships.
An ambitious Harvard student compromised on his career goals to support his family after his parents’ deaths; his lifelong commitment to caring for others helped him to lead one of the happiest lives in the study. Readers can also track how a young woman’s coming out caused her family to fall apart then grew back together, from the perspectives of multiple family members. Insightful commentary and useful tools for assessing readers’ personal relationships further supplement these stories.
Both Waldinger and Schulz’s experiences led them to devote their lives to exploring human happiness. Waldinger studied History of Science as a Harvard undergraduate before entering Harvard Medical School. At medical school, Waldinger found psychiatry a natural fit for his interest in personal histories. In addition to directing the Harvard Study since 2010, Waldinger is a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School as well as a practicing psychiatrist and Zen priest.
For Schulz, he recalls that he was a “neuroscience guy” in his first couple years at Amherst College. After realizing that a bigger-picture view of people’s lives was more interesting, he majored in sociology and pursued a career in policy and community-organizing. Yet, he still sought a more direct means of interacting with people and earned a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. Schulz has co-directed the Harvard Study with Waldinger since 2014; he is also a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr College and a practicing psychologist.
In an interview with the Harvard Crimson, when asked about their motive for compiling key findings from the study in a published book, Waldinger and Schulz shared a smile and referred to a TED Talk that Waldinger gave in 2016. The presentation went viral, amassing almost 23 million views.
“Going viral showed us that there’s a real hunger for this kind of information. People want to know, what does science say about who thrives as they go through life?” Waldinger recalled. As is often the case in academia, results from the Study on Adult Development often remained hidden in journals, motivating Waldinger and Schulz to write “The Good Life” for a larger audience to benefit from their work.
Although the correlation between strong relationships and happiness may seem like common sense, the authors explain that the challenge arises from humans’ irrationality and inability to predict what will make them truly happy.
“There’s been a movement in psychology for quite a while now to try and capture the thinking mistakes we make, the illogical conclusions and assumptions we make,” Schulz said.
In line with this tradition, “The Good Life” seeks to dispel the pervasive and harmful misconception that relationships can take care of themselves while other goals like wealth and fame take priority.
Waldinger and Schulz found that like any other investment, relationships struggle when left unattended. Waldinger marveled at the consistency with which the study revealed that “the people who were the happiest, the healthiest, all that good stuff were the people who were more active, who were more intentional” about making relationships. The book’s illustrative case studies and reflective tools encourage readers to commit more deeply to pre-existing relationships.
For readers looking for a fresh start, “The Good Life” features stories that offer plenty of guidance on life’s serendipity with a growth mindset.
“What we find from studying these people through their lives is that things happen when we least expect it,” Schulz said.
He then referenced one of his favorite psychological experiments: people consistently predict that talking with a stranger on a train will be an unpleasant experience. Yet, the vast majority of experiment subjects, when instructed by a psychologist to speak to a stranger, rated the interaction as a positive, energizing experience. People may believe that they are set in their ways and know what will make them happy, but research finds that any opportunity to build connections can be valuable.
Amidst the dozens of relationships described in “The Good Life”, one in particular stands out — Waldinger and Schulz’s bond as collaborators and lifelong friends. Chapters often end with anecdotes from the co-authors’ lives to illustrate how they have supported each other through life’s milestones and challenges. Their friendship also manifests in the book’s warm, easy-going tone that makes readers feel invited into this rich friendship.
The two met 30 years ago, as co-workers on another longitudinal study on happiness. To nurture their initial connection, Waldinger and Schulz have made the effort to spend at least 90 minutes with each other every week over the past 30 years. Schulz remarked that Waldinger has served as an invaluable older brother figure.
Waldinger further added that the relationship has been incredibly sustaining professionally and personally: “Finding good collaborators is really just a huge benefit. Mark and I each have different strengths, and we do things together we could never do by ourselves. Besides the friendship, there is this kind of fitting together of different abilities that really makes a difference.”
It’s no wonder, then, that “The Good Life” focuses on the power of relationships — it is an undeniable truth, supported by decades of research and the authors’ lifelong friendship. Through touching anecdotes and practical tools, this book empowers readers to make an active commitment to both maintaining existing relationships and building new connections.

“I won’t give up just yet / Gotta lose sometimes to gain,” sings Dutch singer-songwriter Floor Jansen on her debut album “Paragon,” released on March 24. Best known as the frontwoman of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, Jansen began releasing solo tracks in 2020 during the darkest days of the pandemic.
Accordingly, a thematic thread of resilience and hope runs through the album. On “Paragon,” Jansen explores and creates her sound as a soloist, veering into the realm of pop without losing her metal and classical roots. Full of empowering, therapeutic songs that showcase her vocal versatility and unique sound, “Paragon” is an exciting debut that leaves fans with much to anticipate for her future releases.
In an interview with FaceCulture, Jansen spoke about developing her sound as a soloist apart from the metal bands she has sung for. Still, many songs contain symphonic and metal instrumentation beneath their pop formula. The jazzy and mysterious “Me Without You” feels even more experimental than the rest of the songs, but all of them are genre blends in some way — a truly refreshing contribution to the current pop industry.
On “Paragon,” Jansen blends vocal techniques as seamlessly as genres. As an operatically trained soprano with a range of almost four octaves who’s a master at belting and death growls, Jansen is already known for being an extremely versatile singer in the metal scene. Yet switching to pop singing proved to be far from effortless.
The main vocal challenge was to “make it sound open and strong without actually opening all the way” , she explained to [the media page] FaceCulture, because less is more in pop whereas more is often more in metal. But as expected, Jansen has now also mastered this style of singing. “Fire,” her cinematic debut single, showcases this new side of her voice through a dramatic, yet refined build-up that allows her to open up vocally in the end.
Similarly, pop songs are more limited in other formal aspects: In contrast to Nightwish tracks, they aren’t usually 10 minutes long and also tend not to employ complex, classical-inspired harmonies. Again, “Fire” encapsulates her new approach to songwriting and genre: Although it doesn’t contain crazy harmonic changes, it ranges from a slow, ballad-like beginning over a choral interlude to powerful belting, and it is this variety that makes her songs interesting.
It also epitomizes one of the main themes of “Paragon” — resilience — by way of fire being a “metaphor for coming back to life, back into our world outside of our little houses and sofas” after the pandemic, she stated in another interview with FaceCulture in 2022. The song starts with dejected lyrics: “Muted are the days, we lost our will / Frozen in a whirlwind that stands still / Time itself is silent, the silence… / Longing for some warmth back on our face / Find a way to get out of this maze / Scream away the silent, the silence.” As the song slowly starts to soar vocally and instrumentally, Jansen “set[s] alight the dark” in the chorus to “burn the silence down / Let the fire out.”
“Storm” is another impeccable song that captures her formula of slow build-ups and style blends. In the song’s Genius annotations, she stated that “it became a guideline of [her] solo sound.” It begins as a wistful ballad with sparse instrumentation as she sings, “I won’t give up just yet / Gotta lose sometimes to gain / To the whole wide world I’ll say / Gonna make it to the end.” The chorus, especially in the end, gives her powerful voice room to open up, supported by dramatic symphonic instrumentals: “You’re gonna hear my voice roar / Like thunder.” Lyrically, the song explores themes of self-acceptance and dreaming big, of “finding power in saying ‘I am that storm’ with all its imperfections and chaos,” she said in the interview with FaceCulture.
The album’s lyrics seem quite personal to Jansen, as many listeners have pointed out that they might, in addition to the pandemic, also refer to her recent cancer diagnosis (fortunately, she has since undergone treatment and is cancer-free as of last year). However, she has explained that all of the songs were written before her diagnosis and she used to see them more from a mental health perspective, yet she now sings them “really different, from a much more personal perspective as when I wrote the song[s] because then I thought of other people and now I think of me when I sing [them].”
In addition, she sees sharing the difficult moments of her life as a way to empower others by showing on social media that no one’s life is perfect: “More and more of this openness and awareness is seeping through the cracks of the fake and the polished, shiny, and I think that’s super important.”
This openness about her struggles is always accompanied by a positive approach to dealing with them, as all of the songs are life-affirming and hopeful. On the upbeat title track “My Paragon,” Jansen focuses on the good in life by counting her blessings: “There are so many things that I dreamt of, that I made come true,” she stated. In the music video, Jansen hangs out with her childhood and teenager selves, as she lyrically looks into the future (“One day I will be, oh oh / One day I will reach it all / One day is a dream, oh oh”) before coming back to the present moment and realizing that “One day is today / I’m already there.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
New York-based artist and spiritual teacher AA Rashid has made a name for himself in hip-hop by providing introspective and thought-provoking spoken word segments on projects such as Westside Gunn's “Hitler Wears Hermes” mixtape series. His unique contributions to projects from Griselda Records have resonated with fans who appreciate the authentic, gritty sound that has come to define the label. With a wealth of knowledge and a profound connection to the roots of hip-hop, Rashid's influence on Griselda's music and the East Coast underground is undeniable.
Born in Brooklyn, Rashid has been immersed in the culture of hip-hop since its inception. As a young man, he witnessed the evolution of the genre and its connection to the streets of New York City. Growing up alongside the late Notorious B.I.G., Rashid was exposed to the raw talent that would later define the golden era of hip-hop.
“I knew he could [rap] because he used to have impromptu battles with other rappers around my way,” Rashid said. “I saw [B.I.G.] battle this kid from Fort Greene Projects when we were little at a club on Bedford Avenue. That’s the first time I heard him say, ‘I got seven Mac-11's, about eight .38’s.’ This was before everybody in the world heard that, it was amazing.”
Through his study of various spiritual disciplines, Rashid cultivated a deep understanding of the world around him, which he would eventually channel into his spoken word contributions to Griselda Records. He’s also a significant figure in the Five Percent Nation, a cultural movement founded in New York City that has deeply influenced the work of hip-hop acts like Estee Nack, al.divino, Knowledge the Pirate, Busta Rhymes, and the Wu-Tang Clan. This knowledge has been instrumental in shaping his art and is information that he hopes to pass on to others.
“I started teaching as a vocation when I decided that I no longer wanted to go to prison,” Rashid said. “I did 10 years in prison, from the age of 21 and I got out when I was 32. Prior to that, I did 18 months, then I did two years. So I was either in supervision, or prison, or in court, from the age of 15 to 32. I broke the cycle. I decided to use my notes that I’ve acquired over my course of incarceration, as a means by which to instruct the less fortunate.”
A chance meeting with Griselda Records president Westside Gunn in 2014 on a megabus near Atlanta marked the beginning of their creative partnership. “We spoke the entire ride on the bus about fashion,” AA Rashid said. “We never really spoke about music, then at the end of the ride he passed me one of his CDs.”
Rashid reflected on how his eventual listening to the CD was a break from habit. I was like ‘I like the cover.’ But, usually I never listen to people's music when they pass it to you like that because I'm kind of a snob,” he said. “I grew up with B.I.G., so you can't starstruck me. But, I was extremely impressed by his music. And he kind of pushed me back into the genre as a listener and a fan.”
In the years since, Rashid has contributed spoken word verses to numerous Griselda projects including the outro for Westside Gunn’s 2016 mixtape “Flygod” and the opening track for his highly anticipated “10,” which dropped last October. In the interview, Rashid explained that he rarely pre-writes his words. Instead, they come off the cuff or are inspired by his surroundings.
“Flygod is one of my favorite of them, I actually did that in my house,” the artist said. “I mixed my vocals, and I cut the fat off, and I submitted it. I had no expectations whatsoever.”
Despite the seamless way in which Rashid came up with the verse, it was game changing. “When it came out, everything that I had already done before became way more valuable,” he said. “I was getting hit up from all over the world that day.”
As someone closely involved with the Griselda collective, Rashid attributes their success to their ability to maintain a genuine, family-oriented dynamic while still staying true to their roots. He compares the unity of the founding Griselda trio — Westside Gunn, Benny the Butcher, and Conway the Machine — to that of Wu-Tang Clan, which he sees as a significant contribution to the hip-hop community. “People love the concept of family,” he said. “When you find three people that could do something excellently, that’s the dream team.”
Rashid’s influence extends beyond Griselda, as he works to share his knowledge and experiences through various platforms. As a visual artist, he created the cover artwork for Stove God Cooks and Roc Marciano’s 2020 album “Reasonable Drought.” As a spiritual teacher and motivational speaker, he shared that he has aspirations to work in schools and with student unions to foster growth and development in others.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sup y’all, how’s it going?
I hope you’re doing well,
‘Cause I’m about to shed some light
On Harvard’s personnel.

Think about your teachers.
Now think about your peers.
Notice how diversity,
With age, just disappears?

Anyone who goes to class
Quite easily can see
The white homogeneity
Of tenured faculty.
‘Course, if you just look around
Then you’ll be sure to find
A faculty of color with
A truly bad-ass mind.

They’re a leading reference
For scholars in their field
And pave way for discoveries
That once had been concealed.

They’ve won several awards
And even wrote a book!
Their teaching virtuosity
Leaves all their students shook.

But tell me, what’s the likelihood
This Harvard teacher’s got
A tenure track position?
Or what’s more, a tenured spot?

Faculty of color make up
Just a tiny fraction
Of all the tenured teachers here
That you can see in action.

If you do not yet know the stats
I’ll state them here again:
56 percent of them are
White Caucasian men!

The second largest group we have
Is women who are white
They make up 22 percent.
That’s quite the number, right?

That means only 22
percent of tenured folks
Are faculty of color.
That’s so small – holy smokes!

And even that statistic,
is itself, quite complex,
for only five percent are Black
and four, Latinx.

Underrepresented, still,
And to a worse extent,
Are women folks of color
Who make up seven percent.

Surely, now it’s plain to see
That something isn’t right:
For people who have tenure,
Overwhelmingly, are white.

And yet, much of the discourse
That surrounds diversity
Centers around students
In the university.

But in that conversation,
We’re too quick to forget,
That tenured staff positions
Are also hard to get.

And though for Harvard College,
There exists some oversight
To make sure student bodies
Aren’t mostly male and white,

Those same policy pressures
It seems do not extend
To faculty appointments
For this whiteness doesn’t end!

Now don’t misunderstand,
I’ll be clear ‘bout what I’m saying,
Many folks with tenure here
Are very truly slaying.

The problem, as it seems to me,
Has two distinctive parts
The first involves the bias
That the process oft’ imparts.

Tenure track promotions,
For example, must include
A full ad hoc committee
By which profs will be reviewed.

This process has been criticized,
And I think rightly so,
For lacking the transparency
Departments need to grow.

For without detailed feedback
And some free communication,
There are even less checks
To prevent discrimination.

And though Dean Claudine Gay,
Last year, did help to introduce
A new plan to, in theory,
Make this process less obtuse,

If someone doesn’t get the tenure
For which they apply,
Those same ad hoc committees
Still don’t have to tell them why.

This shields committee bias,
Which, we all know exists
And fuels a “lack of trust in”
The whole process that persists.

But also, it’s just hella weird.
Why try and play it pious
When we all know committees
Are all plagued by people’s bias?

Harvard has a history
Of letting people go
Who pioneered their field
In ways that really truly show.

I’m talking ‘bout García Peña
And ‘bout Cornel West
Who, behind closed doors,
Were denied tenure and suppressed.

These scholars are exceptional,
And lead here and abroad.
So Harvard’s bad decision
Shows how much the system’s flawed.

But this leads to my second point
That you all likely know:
Harvard, as a school,
Loves to put on quite a show.

They flaunt on their brochures, “diverse
campus community”
And yet, somehow the tenure track
Receives impunity.

I can’t believe I’m saying this,
But it needs to be said,
‘Cause many Harvard higher ups
Can’t get it through their head:

If you run a school that has some
students and some teachers,
And you want diversity
To be one of your features,

You can’t just stop at undergrads.
That simply just won’t do.
True diversity means
You need diverse teachers, too.
We know the talent pool exists
I see it every day.
So if you truly value it
Then back up what you say.

Harvard says, in summary,
That tenure is reserved
For “excellence” and “eminence”
In people they’ve observed.

But I reject this notion.
For if this claim were true,
Then excellence would mostly come
From white and privileged few.

The truth about the process
Is it needs to be redone
Cause people who deserve to
Aren’t getting tenure, hon!

The wisecrack is right: Harvard really is a $50 billion hedge fund that dabbles in education.
It’s not alone: Many universities across the United States have amassed gargantuan endowments by investing already sizable donations in equity, bonds, and other assets. To be sure, these endowments provide universities with financial stability and help preserve the educational mission in the long term.
But forever building for the future sometimes neglects the present.
A deeper look at endowment data suggests that institutions might have some slack available to increase their annual draw rate. This extra money should be used to reduce the net price of attending college, increase pay for adjuncts and other contingent faculty, and make other improvements to increase overall educational attainment.
But before we delve into the data, we must first understand how the endowment structure works. A university’s endowment is not a rainy day fund. The endowment refers to the amalgamation of many smaller donor-gifted funds, often designated for very specific ventures — say, a particular professorship or a research institute. In many cases, universities’ investment managers are legally obligated to ensure that these donated funds will be able support the specified venture in perpetuity. As a result, universities aiming to preserve the purchasing power of endowment funds over time may err on the conservative side.
Over the past 15 years, the portion of the endowment that most universities spend each year has remained relatively constant. The precise percentage varies by institution and depends on complex formulas, but often, universities set a target spending rate between 4.0 and 5.5 percent of the endowment’s value at the beginning of the year, and then apply it to a moving average of the endowment values over the past three years.
Institutions seem to draw the same annual amount regardless of the endowment’s investment performance in any given year. Take, for instance, Harvard’s fiscal year 2021: The endowment earned an impressive $11.3 billion, but the University contributed only approximately $2 billion to the operating budget.
If those numbers sound like a lot, it’s because they are. Return on investment regularly outstrips institutions’ draw on their endowment, frequently by a significant margin. Although the numbers fluctuate greatly from year to year, the distribution of a sample of institutions with the largest endowments clusters around an 8 percent return. Some of these institutions, though, have even higher average annual return rates, upwards of 13 percent.
Why, then, do rich universities consistently spend such a small portion of their endowment? Blame “endowment hoarding” — universities often prioritize preserving the value of endowment above preserving the value of the university.
This phenomenon becomes particularly evident during recessions. Rather than increasing spending to smooth over market fluctuations and avoid budget cuts, universities sometimes do the opposite, cutting endowment payouts even further. When institutions receive high rates of return, they tend to leave endowment spending unchanged; but during negative shocks, they often slash spending, opting instead to lay off faculty and staff and reduce hiring.
Endowment hoarding seems particularly problematic once you realize how much money is going to endowment managers compared to students. In 2014, five rich institutions including Harvard paid more to private equity fund managers than they dished out in aid to their entire student bodies. Indeed, despite ballooning endowments, the richest universities have failed to implement corresponding increases in financial aid, with one recent study suggesting that endowment growth has little to no effect on net tuition prices. Although Harvard has increased its institutional financial aid offerings to incoming undergraduates since 2008, that aid has increased at a slower rate than the endowment.
Raising annual spending by a percentage or two isn’t even that scary. On average, 50 of the largest endowments have grown by 4.31 percent per year in real terms, even after factoring in 5 percent annual spending.
At the very least, universities should look for extra wiggle room in their contractual obligations. After all, just because an endowment is held in perpetuity doesn’t mean that it needs to increase in value each year.
Take for example Harvard’s Hollis Professorship of Divinity, the oldest endowed professorship in the United States, established in 1721. Although the University might be obligated to set aside enough funds each year in order to pay out the chaired professor’s salary, the endowment growth has undoubtedly outpaced any increases in professor salary. So, rather than reinvesting all the extra returns into the endowment, Harvard could spend at least some of that surplus without seriously jeopardizing the professorship position.
Ultimately, I understand the need for a certain degree of realism and conservatism when managing such large funds for the future, and I realize that universities do not have limitless discretion when determining how to spend their endowments. But perhaps asset managers overemphasize future improvement at the expense of access today.
An extra percentage or two goes a long way when we’re talking about funds on the order of billions of dollars. That money could be used to fund any number of projects that improve educational quality in the present — investments that will pay greater long-term dividends than simply accumulating money in university hedge funds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
To the Class of 2027: Welcome to Harvard College!
With every new class comes a beautiful mosaic of perspectives, dreams, and possibilities that illuminates the Harvard community. As the old cliché goes, it’s the people who make Harvard a truly transformative place — and we can’t wait to meet you, the newest additions to our colorful campus, at Visitas.
As you excitedly explore the different facets of the community that you may soon call home, one of the first things you will likely notice are the numbers: the percentage of the Class of 2027 admitted students hailing from each region of the country and around the world, the racial composition of the admitted class, and the proportion of students intending to pursue various fields of study.
While these demographic breakdowns from the Admissions Office paint a partial picture of our campus’s vibrant future, there is one glaring gap in the data that distorts our view of diversity at the College: the lack of descriptors related to socioeconomic class.
Why was this statistic — vital to understanding the composition of the Harvard undergraduate population — conspicuously omitted from the school’s press releases yet again?
The answer is obvious: For the College’s entire history, socioeconomic diversity at Harvard has been abjectly non-existent. Of course, given its genesis from pockets of wealth and political influence, it’s no surprise that Harvard was built to educate the elite. What is quite galling is that it still does.
According to a study by Harvard’s own Economics professor Raj Chetty, at the turn of the millennium, there were 23 times as many high-income students enrolled at Harvard as low-income students. Much more recent data from The Crimson’s first-year survey for the Class of 2025 indicates that 13.9 percent of the current sophomore cohort reportedly hails from households earning less than $40,000 — a bracket that, by contrast, accounts for 29 percent of the American population.
Why would the Admissions Office admit this reality, or even publish the statistics necessary to corroborate the numbers, when Harvard prides itself on being accessible to low income students?
The lack of socioeconomic diversity data is particularly insidious because many students can go through Harvard never noticing this homogeneity — never truly comprehending how their cohort of peers utterly fails to be representative of the rest of the country and the world. Class is not always visible on the surface, making the lack of public statistics on socioeconomic demographics especially dangerous at an institution that touts its ability to cultivate future citizen-leaders.
Given the value of a diverse student body to provide more perspectives and lived experiences to campus discourse, admitting more low-income students must be a top priority for Harvard. Carefully weighing socioeconomic factors would also help correct for the persistent inequity that plagues Harvard’s admissions process, in which wealthy, privileged applicants routinely perform better on metrics weighed by college admissions officers.
It does not escape us that Harvard just released a triumphant announcement about financial aid expansion, wherein families making under $85,000 annually (up from $75,000) will not be required to contribute to their student’s education or living expenses at Harvard. This accomplishment is penny-sized given that it fails to get at the root of the problem — a systemic shortage of low-income admits.
Already, Harvard is a less expensive option than a public university for more than ninety percent of American families. The problem, then, is not with the amount of financial aid being offered at Harvard; it’s the dearth of students this aid is being spent upon.
Harvard’s socioeconomic diversity problem begins even before admissions decisions occur. Most qualified low-income students don’t apply to selective colleges despite the fact that those who do enroll have very high graduation rates. Given that research shows that targeted outreach to these high-achieving, low-income students is both cost-effective and impactful, Harvard should prioritize recruiting low-income students, increase outreach to non-elite high schools and community colleges, and expand high school summer programs for prospective low-income students.
Harvard should also publish data on the socioeconomic breakdown of admitted students in the same way it does for racial and geographic statistics. Without these statistics, students are hard-pressed to hold Harvard accountable for its commitment to fostering diversity of all kinds.
Harvard hides other demographic disparities, too, by its refusal to publish more granular details about its admitted students. Descendants of slavery in America, or Generational African Americans, are commonly perceived to be underrepresented on campus. Harvard should provide additional data on ethnic breakdowns within broader racial categories to highlight the disparities in representation that exist within groups. By refusing to collect or publicly share these more detailed statistics, Harvard is choosing to ignore inequalities within its blanket celebration of “diversity” and risk exacerbating such divides even further.
The Harvard Class of 2027 will probably go down in history: It may be the product of the last admissions cycle wherein Harvard employs race-conscious admissions in its current form. After this summer, it will likely be harder — perhaps significantly harder — for American colleges and universities to enroll diverse student bodies. Yet we refuse to accept backsliding from where we are today in terms of our beautiful, technicolor-brilliant student body, and we can (and should!) continue to push Harvard for even more diversity across multiple forms.
So to the Class of 2027: Congratulations, and welcome to your new community. As you excel in your studies, forge ahead in new disciplines, and join the ranks of those educated at America’s oldest institution of higher education, never neglect to question the numbers that surround you. With an attitude like that, you might just bring about a more vibrant, equitable world.

Mary Louise Kelly ’93, the co-host of NPR’s flagship news program All Things Considered, will speak at the second annual Harvard Alumni Day event in June, the University announced Monday afternoon.
Kelly will deliver the keynote speech to Alumni Day attendees on June 2 from Harvard Yard, with the University livestreaming her address for those who cannot attend in-person. Kelly’s return to campus will also coincide with the 30th reunion celebrations for the Harvard College ​​Class of 1993.
The Harvard Alumni Association traditionally met annually on the afternoon of Commencement and Harvard College and Radcliffe class reunions were held over the following days. Under former HAA Executive Director Phillip W. Lovejoy, the University moved to separate Commencement from in-person annual alumni events in order to better accommodate the increasing size of Harvard’s graduating classes and alumni reunions.
Kelly told the Harvard Gazette, a University-run publication, that being selected to speak at Alumni Day was an “honor, obviously, and a pleasure” but also “a little daunting.”
For Kelly, the opportunity also holds personal significance. She said her late father James P. “Jim” Kelly ’68 “never missed a reunion, and neither have I.”
“I think, ‘Well, Dad would be interested in what I have to say, so maybe his classmates and other alumni will too,’” she added.
A prominent name in journalism, Kelly led the on-the-ground NPR team that was named as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2021 for its reporting in Iran. She has also received several other awards throughout her career, including the Leonard Zeidenberg First Amendment Award and a Gracie Award.
A former Eliot House resident, Kelly studied government and was a Crimson News editor during her time at the College. Since graduating, she has served as an alumni interviewer, held volunteer leadership positions in class reunion committees, and been nominated as a candidate for chief marshal in 2018 by her classmates.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow told the Harvard Gazette that Kelly is an “inspired choice” to speak at the Alumni Day Event.
“She has expanded the perspectives of countless people over decades of reporting in the United States and elsewhere. We are delighted to have enticed her away from her desk and back to Harvard,” Bacow said.
Allyson C. Mendenhall ’90, president of the Harvard Alumni Association, praised Kelly’s “spirit of intellectual curiosity.”
“Her reporting and on-air storytelling have touched the hearts and minds of countless people around the world — lending her a unique perspective to both the opportunities and challenges we all face as a global community,” Mendenhall said to the Gazette. “I know her words will resonate deeply with her fellow alumni and remind us just how powerful our impact can be.”

Harvard University President-elect Claudine Gay will be inaugurated in a ceremony steeped in tradition in Tercentenary Theatre on Sept. 29, the Office of the University Marshal announced Monday.
Gay was elected to serve as Harvard’s 30th president in December following a brief five-month search. When she takes office in Massachusetts Hall on July 1, Gay will become the first person of color and only the second woman to lead America’s oldest academic institution.
Gay, the outgoing dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is currently leading searches for four deans, including her own successor. Leaders of Harvard’s Divinity School, School of Public Health, and School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will also step down from their roles at the end of the 2022-23 academic year.
The inauguration ceremony will likely feature a series of storied traditions, with Gay expected to receive the University’s keys, seals, and charter before sitting briefly in the notoriously uncomfortable Holyoke chair as her predecessors have.
But one long-standing tradition, dating back to the past nine presidents, will change.
For the first time in 160 years, a Harvard president will be inaugurated in a month other than October. Thomas Hill, who was sworn in as the 20th University president on March 4, 1863, is the most recent example of a presidential installment ceremony occurring outside the month of October.
Gay, however, will continue a more recent trend of holding the presidential installment ceremony on a Friday. The four most recent Harvard presidents — Lawrence S. Bacow, Drew G. Faust, Lawrence H. Summers, and Neil L. Rudenstine — were inaugurated on Fridays in October.
Gay’s inauguration date was selected based on a variety of factors, including previously scheduled events, religious holidays, and other calendar considerations, according to University spokesperson Jason A. Newton.
The details of the inauguration are still being planned, but it will be held in the afternoon and is expected to feature a variety of prominent attendees — including all of Gay’s living presidential predecessors — to welcome her into the new role. Gay will also give a speech of her own, which will likely outline her plans for her tenure as president.
At Bacow’s inauguration, a slew of academic and public figures gathered to address the audience, including L. Rafael Reif, president of MIT at the time, and Amanda S.C. Gorman ’20, the inaugural United States Youth Poet Laureate, who delivered an original poem.
Bacow’s installation ceremony also saw demonstrations related to the #MeToo movement in protest of the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh — who faced accusations of sexual assault — to the Supreme Court and to highlight the presence of sexual harrassment and assault on college campuses.
The afternoon ceremony will be open to all Harvard affiliates.

Harvard Kennedy School is in the “early stages of exploring” a plan to combine the Master of Public Policy and Master of Public Administration programs into an expanded degree program, HKS Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf announced in an email to students early last month.
The merged MPP program would consist of a required core curriculum along with a set of elective classes, Elmendorf wrote in the email, dated March 1.
“If such a merger could be achieved, all graduates of the expanded program would demonstrate their competency in key domains that are generally important for policymakers and public leaders and also could demonstrate their achievements in specific areas if they wanted to do so,” Elmendorf wrote.
The Kennedy School’s MPA program does not currently have a required core curriculum.
The announcement followed several meetings between HKS administrators — including Elmendorf, Academic Dean Suzanne J. Cooper, and MPA Program Emma Heffern — and Kennedy School Student Government representatives over the past few months regarding the merger, the first of which occurred in December 2022.
In January, KSSG representatives sent an email to MPA students, writing that Elmendorf said he made the “broad decision” to merge the programs during the December meeting.
KSSG representatives wrote Elmendorf said HKS administrators began considering the decision to merge the degree programs several years ago, but plans were interrupted by the pandemic. The email also stated Elmendorf cited the lack of a MPA core curriculum — as well as confusion regarding the difference between the degree programs — to justify the merger.
KSSG representatives have called for Elmendorf to be transparent about his decision to merge the programs and solicit student feedback. In the January email sent to MPA students, KSSG student representatives wrote that Elmendorf said, “high level decisions concerning program changes do not require student input,” during the December meeting.
“Students and alumni deserve more transparency, consideration, and a participatory voice in this decision which has a tremendous impact on anyone in the MPA community,” the email stated.
HKS spokesperson James F. Smith referred to Elmendorf’s emailed March announcement in response to a request for comment.
In their January email, KSSG representatives also defended the MPA program, arguing that its “flexibility and class variety” allows the Kennedy School to “attract a more diverse set of student profiles.”
In February, KKSG representatives sent a follow-up email to Kennedy School students describing their attempts to increase student input in the school’s decision-making process.
“Although no current student will be impacted directly, it obviously sucks to have your degree program discontinued or altered without transparency,” the email stated. “We have voiced our concerns to the administration that student engagement through this change process can be more effective.”
“We, along with other degree program reps, have been working for months to ensure student input and experiences regarding this are properly captured and represented,” KSSG second-year MPA representative Krizia R. Lopez wrote in an email to The Crimson.
On March 21 — nearly three weeks after Elmendorf’s email announcement — KSSG representatives wrote in another email to MPA students that Elmendorf agreed to run focus groups on the MPA student experience and learning outcomes, as well as hold a town hall addressing student concerns. The town hall is set to take place Friday afternoon.
“The programs and curricula offered by the Kennedy School today have been strengthened by changes that were implemented by our predecessors, and all of us here today have a responsibility to consider changes that could strengthen a Harvard Kennedy School education in the future,” Elmendorf wrote in his March email. “We look forward to collaborating with you on this work.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Billionaire Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker discussed his role as a progressive Democrat in the Midwest and the influence of big money on politics at a Harvard Institute of Politics forum Monday evening.
The event was moderated by IOP Director Setti D. Warren — who was recently named to the permanent director role — and Chicago native Naomi M.S. Corlette ’25. It also included opening remarks from IOP Fellow Quentin Fulks, who was previously a campaign manager for Pritzker.
Pritzker, a Democrat who is in his second term as governor, has passed a number of progressive policies since taking office. During his tenure, he signed legislation raising the state minimum wage to $15 by 2025, legalized marajuana, and, in January, banned the sale and distribution of assault weapons.
But on Monday, Pritzker said he is more than just a progressive.
“You keep drilling in on the ‘progressive’ label, and you know what, I’m okay with that. But I just want to maybe modify it and say I would describe myself as a pragmatic progressive,” Pritzker said.
“I think it’s tell people what you believe, get elected on it, and then do it, and don’t compromise on the things that really matter to people’s lives,” he added.
During a question and answer session that followed the event, Pritzker — who is valued at $3.6 billion — was pressed by multiple students for self-funding his campaigns for governor.
“Do I think the self-funding campaigns are the answer to politics? No, absolutely not,” he said. “We need campaign finance reform both in Illinois and nationally.”
Responding to students, Pritzker said that his 2018 gubernatorial opponent — then-incumbent Governor Bruce V. Rauner — self-funded $50 million into his own campaign.
Pritzker said he believes Democrats must continue working within campaign finance laws as long as Republicans do, or they would give their opponents an edge in political races.
“We can’t let the other side essentially have the entire field while we are trying to do the right thing and get campaign finance reform passed,” he said.
At an IOP forum last month, New Hampshire Governor Chris T. Sununu said Pritzker would be an ideal challenger to Biden in the Democratic primary, saying he would “probably win” against the President.
When asked by Warren on Monday, Pritzker did not deny a potential presidential bid, but he affirmed that Biden is “running for reelection.”
“Joe Biden brings two things to the job that he’s demonstrated already,” Pritzker said. “He gets big things done, especially for working families and people who have gotten left out. And second, he’s probably the most empathetic person that has ever held the office, or at least in my lifetime — that is his superpower.”
Despite no public 2024 presidential aspirations, Pritzker said he will remain an active financial contributor to Democrats.
“I’m supporting candidates all over the United States with my resources,” Pritzker said.
“You might think that’s good or bad, but it’s not just supporting me — it’s about electing Democrats up and down the ticket in every state in the United States,” he added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences held a series of events for an annual celebration of diversity in STEM last week.
BRIDGE Week — which stands for Building Relationships, Increasing Diversity, and Growing Engineers — started in 2018 as a partnership between three organizations: the National Society of Black Engineers, Society of Women Engineers, and Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers.
The week’s events came roughly five months after SEAS released results from its 2022 climate survey, which found that roughly 21 percent of respondents said they have experienced harassment or discrimination. The figure was higher for respondents from historically marginalized racial and gender identities.
The survey also found that 36 percent of SEAS affiliates felt “inclusion and belonging” at the school, which was consistent with levels from 2018.
The program kicked off last Monday with an alumni panel featuring Irene Y. Chen ’14, Carter J. Ithier ’14 , Marinna Madrid, Sorell S. Massenburg, and Alice E. White. During the event, the panelists discussed their experiences with diversity and inclusion in their careers and offered advice to attendees.
Madrid — a 2018 alum of Harvard’s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the co-founder of biotechnology startup Cellino — said during the panel that while she found academia to be a “pretty welcoming and open-minded place,” her early experiences in industry were more challenging.
“I’ve been asked what’s different between what we’re doing and what Theranos is doing, when the only thing that’s the same is that we’re both women,” Madrid said.
Madrid said as she gained “clout and influence” in her industry, she was able to stand up for other young entrepreneurial women.
“I can advocate for them. And if I see someone who I think is acting discriminatory, I can let them go,” she said.
Chen, an incoming assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said she feels there is a “tremendous appetite” for understanding the types of problems faced by academia.
“There’s a lot of willingness to help. Maybe they don’t know, necessarily, how to,” Chen said. “There are very real constraints on resourcing and figuring out how to support all of the communities.”
Aside from the panel, this year’s BRIDGE Week also included a senior thesis celebration, a banquet at the Science and Engineering Complex, a student affinity mixer, and a screening of the movie “Coded Bias,” which centers on the discovery of racial bias in facial recognition algorithms.
Edward Alexander Jr. — SEAS’ assistant director of diversity, inclusion, and belonging — lauded the week as a success.
“We definitely wanted to celebrate people who went through Harvard and identified as underrepresented in STEM,” he said. “I think we were able to hear a lot of their great stories, especially as it relates to their journey from where they were, back when they were on campus to now — their career.”
Alexander also praised the efforts of the eight diversity, inclusion, and belonging fellows — composed of undergraduate and graduate students in SEAS — for formulating and organizing the events of the week.
Massenburg, who received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 2016 and spoke on the panel, said in an interview that the event offered a “wide range of experiences” for students to hear from.
“I was very happy to come back today to share some insights and some of the lessons I learned during my time here,” he said.
Giridhar M. Anand, a Ph.D. candidate at SEAS, said the panel was useful in helping him explore options after he completes his program.
“I’m looking to graduate this year and trying to figure out what to do next, and I think it’s very useful to get a global view of all the different opportunities that there are after graduation,” Anand said.

Environmental policy experts discussed China’s energy policies during an event at the Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs Monday.
The event featured Weila Gong, a Belfer Center postdoctoral research fellow, and Georgetown University professor Joanna I. Lewis, who discussed their joint research exploring China’s coal consumption, its pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, and the political and economic factors hindering the country’s transition away from coal.
The event was jointly sponsored by the Belfer Center’s Environment and Natural Resources Program, the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, the Harvard University Center for the Environment, and the Salata Institute for Climate and Sustainability.
Lewis said China’s coal consumption, which outpaces most other countries, does not align with its stated clean energy goals and policies.
“This is sort of happening at a time where overall global trends are really seeing a decline in coal use globally,” she said. “Except in China and a handful of other emerging economies.”
Lewis described an array of political and economic obstacles that may contribute to China’s rising coal consumption.
“The coal industry is, of course, a massive employer in China–one of the largest employers in the country,” she said. “There’s a variety of local economic incentives to keep mining coal, keep running coal plants, in terms of how taxes are paid out.”
Gong said regions that depend heavily on coal for income may not benefit from the rise of renewable energy as much as other areas. She cited Shanxi province, which derives 40 percent of its income from the coal industry, as an example.
“Shanxi province produced over 1 billion tons of coal last year, which accounted for almost one-third of China’s national coal production that year,” Gong said. “The province is boasting a strategic route in defending China’s national security, energy security.”
Gong also said national security considerations in China’s energy policies mean that not all of the country’s coal plants may operate at full capacity.
“If you take a look at China’s National Energy Strategy, those coal power plants can be also used as a backup capacity,” Gong said.
Gong said her and Lewis’ research found that China's policies predominantly aim to hold coal consumption steady.
“Despite the increased attention on coal transition, we find that the Chinese government has still pretty much prioritized the coal maintenance strategy rather than a coal reduction strategy,” she said.
Gong and Lewis hypothesize that this misalignment is due to a lack of coordination between environment and economic interests in China’s policymaking process.
“China’s coal transition is not just about technology transformation. It’s also about social justice,” Gong said. “The national government have been able to provide a series of policy strategies and instruments to support the just transition.”
“The problem with that is it’s still primarily focused on helping those enterprises and less emphasized on coal workers and coal communities,” she added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Billionaire hedge fund CEO and Republican megadonor Kenneth C. Griffin ’89 donated $300 million to Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the University announced Tuesday morning.
Harvard will rename the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences after Griffin, who has now given more than half a billion dollars to the University.
“Generosity and loyalty are among the defining characteristics of our alumni,” Harvard President Lawrence S. Bacow and FAS Dean and President-elect Claudine Gay wrote in an announcement Tuesday morning, adding that they are “deeply grateful” for Griffin’s “continued confidence and steadfast engagement.”
The gift comes as GSAS is celebrating its 150th anniversary during the 2022-23 academic year.
“For the past 150 years, GSAS has nurtured and expanded the ambitions of students who have changed the world through their vast and varied scholarly pursuits. Now, the Harvard Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will do the same,” Bacow and Gay wrote.
Griffin — whose name is also on Harvard’s undergraduate financial aid office following a $150 million donation in 2014 — made his fortune in finance, founding the investment firm Citadel LLC in 1990 and, in 2002, trading firm Citadel Securities. Citadel LLC currently manages approximately $57 billion in assets.
Griffin’s gift is unrestricted, meaning Harvard can utilize the given funds for purposes at its own discretion. According to the University press release, the donation will support “long-term excellence in teaching and research” in the school’s various fields.
“Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences is committed to advancing ideas that will shape humanity’s future, while providing important insight into our past,” Griffin said in the release. “I am excited to support the impactful work of this great institution.”
Along with a $500,000 donation to President Joe Biden’s inaugural committee, Griffin also donated nearly $60 million to Republican candidates in the 2022 election cycle.
Griffin made headlines last November for announcing that he would not support former president Donald J. Trump’s reelection campaign, instead announcing his support for Florida Governor Ron D. DeSantis for president. DeSantis has not yet announced a presidential bid.
GSAS Dean Emma Dench celebrated the gift in the press release, saying that the donation will “support our students as they engage in the inquiry and innovation that will ultimately lead to positive impact on the world.”
The newly-renamed Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences is the third Harvard school named after a donor or their family member since 1638, when the University took John Harvard’s name following his donation.
After a 376-year hiatus, Harvard renamed its School of Public Health in 2014 after T.H. Chan, the father of private equity investor and donor Gerald L. Chan. Harvard also renamed its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences after a $400 million donation in 2015 from hedge fund magnate John A. Paulson.
Griffin has donated more than $1.5 billion to various charitable organizations, including to the Art Institute of Chicago and the Obama Foundation. Griffin was included in the Forbes list of America’s Most Generous Givers in 2023.
Correction: April 13, 2023
A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences was the third Harvard school named after a donor since 1638. In fact, the School of Public Health, named for T.H. Chan, was renamed through a donation by his son Gerald L. Chan.

The Cambridge City Council debated a policy order to expand Memorial Drive traffic closures and discussed an upcoming Cambridge mental health resources report at their weekly meeting Monday.
Councilors Patricia M. Nolan ’80 and Burhan Azeem presented a policy order regarding the Department of Conservation and Recreation’s decision to only close Memorial Drive to traffic on Sundays this year. The change represented a rollback of the pandemic practice of closing Memorial Drive to traffic on Saturdays and Sundays, transforming the state highway into Riverbend Park.
On Feb. 27, the council voted 7-2 to direct the city manager to work with relevant departments and agencies to continue the Saturday and Sunday Memorial Drive traffic closures. Despite this, the DCR, a Massachusetts state agency, issued its decision to revert to Sunday closures on April 3.
According to Nolan, the proposed policy order details “the history of this entire quest for many of us in the city to simply open up the park for another day” and asks the DCR to release the information that the department has that ultimately led to their decision.
“This is about listening to the community. This is about honoring the community,” Nolan said. “That’s why I think it is incumbent on all of us and on DCR and the city to find ways to minimize whatever impact there is.”
Councilor Paul F. Toner said he agrees with the DCR’s decision and will not support the policy order.
“If anybody’s going to do anything, that’s our legislature about changing the law to make it Saturdays and Sundays,” he said.
Councilor E. Denise Simmons exercised her charter right on the policy order, delaying further discussion until the next council meeting.
The council also discussed a proposed mental health outreach initiative detailed in an April 5 report by the Cambridge Public Health Department, which discusses expanded access in underserved communities. The report recommends a $26,500 effort involving local education events, resources for non-English speakers, and expanding awareness of the city’s mental health programs.
Officials from the CPHD fielded questions on Cambridge Health Alliance, a health and hospital provider serving Cambridge and its surrounding areas.
Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan asked about the amount of funding devoted to expanding outreach in low-income and marginalized residents.
“I’m just really deeply concerned about people with fewer resources being able to get access to the help that they need,” he said. “In terms of publicizing and making them aware, I certainly appreciate that effort, but it just feels like $26,000 is just not going to get us very far.”
Derrick L. Neal, the city’s chief public health officer, said the funds would be targeted toward engagement with those who need it most.
“It’s to refer those individuals into the behavioral health system that Cambridge Health Alliance has developed,” he said. “Is this going to be adequate and will it serve everyone? No, but it’s a great start, and our intention is to build upon and expand upon this service.”
The council will reconvene April 24, 2023, for regular city council meetings.

As the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers remains locked in yearlong contract negotiations with the University, Harvard Provost Alan M. Garber ’76 said the University is committed to providing its workers “appropriately generous” compensation.
HUCTW has been bargaining for a new contract with the University since April 2022, marking its longest period of negotiations in a decade. The union’s previous contract with Harvard expired on Sept. 30, 2022, but both sides agreed to extend the current agreement until a new one could be negotiated.
During a Thursday interview, Garber acknowledged that negotiations had “been going on for a long time” but reiterated his belief that “both sides are bargaining in good faith.”
“Members of the HUCTW are indeed some of the most important members of our community,” he added.
Wages remain one of the most pressing issues for HUCTW members, who have demanded wage increases to keep pace with rising inflation.
HUCTW President Carrie E. Barbash said in an interview Monday that though the union and Harvard are in the process of negotiating, members feel that the University needs to place greater emphasis on “how much its staff — our members — are struggling.”
“Our members haven’t, I think, had a raise in a year and a half and have really been struggling with the cost of living,” Barbash said. “We feel like the University needs to give more weight to that and is not addressing that concern in their offers.”
Garber said on Thursday that the University is dedicated to ensuring that HUCTW members “have compensation that is appropriately generous and that they will have the ability to have fulfilling work lives at Harvard.”
Harvard has seen a spike in labor activity across campus in recent months, including the formation of two new unionization campaigns: the Harvard Undergraduate Workers Union and Harvard Academic Workers-United Automobile Workers.
HUWU has since affiliated with Harvard’s graduate students union and launched a card campaign, which organizers say has achieved the threshold necessary to proceed to a formal union election through the National Labor Relations Board. HAW-UAW also launched a public card campaign and held its first rallies in February.
Still, Garber declined to comment on whether the University will voluntarily recognize HUWU and HAW-UAW, calling an announcement “premature.”
“If a union is voted in and therefore we will face collective bargaining negotiations with the union, we will act in good faith,” he added. “We will bargain in good faith as we do with all of our existing unions.”
The University, however, informed HUWU on Friday — one day after Garber’s interview — that it would not voluntarily recognize it. In an email obtained by The Crimson, Harvard Director of Labor and Employee Relations Paul R. Curran wrote that the University would only recognize HUWU through a “full and fair election” overseen by the NLRB.
“While we understand your union seeks recognition without a vote, the University is steadfast in its position that every eligible student be given the opportunity to make their voices heard on this important matter,” Curran wrote.
During the Thursday interview, Garber said the University has been “working hard” to implement the eight recommendations laid out in the 2020 Mental Health Taskforce Report, which has included rolling out expanded telehealth services during the current academic year.
Harvard Counseling and Mental Health Service announced last fall that it established a partnership with TimelyCare, a virtual mental health service that provides students with 12 free counseling sessions each academic year.
“A very large number of students have used TimelyCare and the satisfaction ratings have been very, very high,” he said.
Garber said the University is dedicated to improving mental health care for all students.
“The problems of students in crisis are ideally addressed before they’re in crisis, in addition to providing them with care when they are in crisis,” Garber said.
Still, Garber said that “nobody has the perfect solution to these problems” and stressed that improving mental health across campus is a “community effort.”
“I am not saying that we should be satisfied with where we are. We continue to look for ways to improve,” he said. “The important message is it remains critical for students, faculty, and staff who face students, family members, friends to really keep an eye out for each other.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After months characterized by podium wins, major upsets, and long-awaited results, Harvard wrestling has wrapped up a remarkable 2022-23 season. The season took place across five winter months, opening in November with the Journeymen Collegiate Classic in Bethlehem, Pa.,  and culminating in mid-March with the NCAA Championships in Tulsa, Okla.
The Crimson boasted strong team showings across the season’s 14 tournaments, securing an impressive third-overall placing in the Ivy League and qualifying four members of its squad for the NCAA Championships: senior Yaraslau Slavikouski, juniors Philip Conigliaro and Joshua Kim, and sophomore Diego Sotelo.
‘‘I’ve been on the team for a couple of years, including the Covid year, and this year is really special because it seems the team is really starting to take shape in the sense that things are starting to click. We're starting to do really well,” co-captain Conigliaro said.
“We had a difficult year last year because of injuries,” head coach Jay Weiss said. “I felt we had more talent than we’ve had in a long time so I was looking forward to [this year].”
The Journeymen Classic proved to be a promising start, as Harvard clinched six first-place finishes, five second-place finishes, and three third-place finishes. This amounted to a successful fourth-place finish overall in the tournament for the Crimson.
The following weekend, Harvard returned to Pennsylvania to compete at the Keystone Classic in Philadelphia. With solid results across the team, the highlight of the tournament saw Kim defeat No. 20 Lucas Revano from the University of Pennsylvania, coming away with a 3-1 victory and bringing home a fourth-place finish in the 165-pound weight bracket.
The Crimson continued this steady momentum through into December. The two-day Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational showcased Harvard heavyweight co-captain Slavikouski’s dominance on the mat, as the Belarus native won six of his seven matches and placed third in the 285-pound weight bracket. The weekend also saw Harvard wrestlers face off against nationally-ranked opponents, and No. 13 Kim took down No. 4 Austin Yant of Northern Iowa in a stunning upset. Harvard finished the tournament ranked 18th out of 33 participating schools.
As December came to a close, Harvard traveled to Evanston, Ill., and emerged with an impressive weekend that saw the Crimson register a score of 55.5 points over the two-day tournament. Sotelo finished third in his 125-pound weight bracket, accumulating a total of 23.0 team points. Slavikouski placed fourth in his respective weight bracket, securing a second consecutive top-five finish and earning 14.5 team points.
The new year offered a challenge for the Crimson. In a dual season opener, Harvard fell to the University of Carolina by a score of 22-12 and dropped their matches the following weekend against Binghamton and Cornell by scores of 19-13 and 27-12, respectively. To close out their Ivy Road Trip, the Crimson fell 28-8 in a matchup against the University of Pennsylvania.
Nonetheless, these tournaments proved to be anomalies in the Crimson’s season results.
In late Jan., Harvard prevailed in a thrilling matchup against Princeton, defeating the Tigers 20-18 in their home at Jadwin Gym. This victory represented Harvard’s first win against their Ivy foe in ten years, as well as their first victory of the dual season. Starting in the 125-pound weight bracket, Sotelo gave the Crimson a 3-0 lead from the get-go. Other Harvard wrestlers that day included first-years Joseph Cangro and Jack Crook, as well as senior Trevor Tarsi, whose respective victories increased the Crimson’s lead. After injury-ridden weeks which saw Conigliaro miss several competitions, the captain returned to action with an 8-4 victory, propelling the Crimson to lead 17-9. While the Tigers pulled back into the lead after matches in the 184- and 197-pound weight brackets, this lead proved insufficient as Slavikouski defeated No. 33 Travis Stefanik 4-1, lifting the Crimson to a stunning 20-18 victory.
Weiss was proud of the team’s ability to come together and secure the long-awaited win. “It felt like guys wrestled hard for the team, they were looking to score points and big wins. It was a good win — Princeton has a strong team,” Weiss said.
For Conigliaro, beating Princeton was critical to showcasing the team’s prowess. “On paper, people outside our program may have thought we weren’t able to do it, but we proved to them that we could,” he remarked.
The Crimson’s return home to Cambridge in Feb. saw the team secure a major win over Columbia in the Malkin Athletic Center in a tight 19-18 matchup. Harvard prevailed in its first five matches, with Conigliaro, Slavikouski, Sotelo, and junior Leo Tarantino’s victories helping carry the Crimson’s lead over the Lions. The critical win of the dual finally came with first-year Dante Frinzi’s victory over Angelo Rini, which delivered a crucial six points to Harvard and secured the team’s narrow win.
A Massachusetts native, Conigliaro has been attending Harvard wrestling matches since he was younger. “I haven’t heard the MAC have that much energy at matches in a long, long time,” he said.
Conigliaro adds that he attributes part of the team's success to the influence of a home crowd. “Having friends and family cheering on definitely helps you in the match and just having everyone and the crowd behind you is very special — that’ll stick with you for a long time and being able to win at home is a very special thing,” he said.
Fresh off its victory over Columbia, Harvard cruised to a 25-11 over Hofstra the following day. The Crimson won seven out of ten matchups, helping deliver their second overall win in under 24 hours. Their victory in three of the past four matches also brought them to .500 in EIWA play.
The Crimson’s winning streak strengthened throughout February, as they secured a resounding 32-10 victory over Brown on Senior Night. The match saw the Crimson win eight of ten matches and attain its season-high score of 32 points.
As March approached, Harvard competed in the Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association (EIWA) Championships. Strong performances across the team saw the Crimson earn 63 team points and five podium places, bringing the team to an eighth-place finish overall.
The tournament also impressively saw four members of Harvard’s squad qualify for the NCAA Championships in Tulsa, Okla. later that month. Sotelo was the first athlete in the tournament to clinch his ticket down south and was shortly followed by Kim, who placed fifth in the 165-pound weight bracket, as well as Conigliaro, who earned his third consecutive NCAA bid. Entering the tournament ranked No. 1 in the 285-pound weight bracket, Slavikouski suffered an upset in the semis but fired back in the next round, closing out the EIWA Championships with a third-place finish and securing his spot in the season’s culminating tournament.
“Watching everyone compete for their hearts out and going to NCAAs with four qualifiers was really special. Especially for me, I was grateful to compete at NCAAs with a couple of my good friends on my team,” said Conigliaro, who was the Crimson’s sole qualifier to the tournament last year. “It was definitely a lot more fun being there with my teammates this year and having a good time together.”
The NCAA Championships stands as the season’s culminating event. “Everything we do is for those three days in March. [The NCAAs] is the crown jewel of our sport,” Weiss said. "It’s really a life-changing moment to get there.”
The four NCAA qualifiers represented Harvard’s largest number of wrestlers to compete in the tournament in over a decade, where the Crimson placed 44th out of 67 participating teams from across the country.
Notably, Harvard’s strong performances throughout the season earned a number of its squad members spots on the All-Ivy League team. Slavikouski, who finished his dual season by going undefeated in EIWA play, was unanimously named to the All-Ivy League First Team in his 285-pound weight bracket. Standout sophomore Sotelo was named to the Second-Team at 125 pounds, followed by senior Trevor Tarsi and Conigliaro, who were honorable mentions at 157- and 174-pound classes respectively. Finally, Kim was also named to the All-Ivy Academic Team for his success both in and out of the classroom this season.
Reflecting on this season, Conigliaro highlights the value of a strong team dynamic. “We hope to continue what we have been doing this year, improving all facets of our game together as a team. It may be an individual sport but we compete as a team, whether it’s at a tournament or a dual.”
“A big thing is to have the older, more experienced guys helping out the younger guys. We have a really great class of incoming freshmen that I look forward to introducing them to college wrestling — I’m sure they’ll make a big impact”, he added.
As a coach, Weiss noted that, “It’s a joy to coach. When you ask what was I most proud or happy about this season, it was just the way this team came together,” he reflected. “This is a close-knit team — I personally need it that way, and that’s how I can operate best. We recruit that way, we look for who’s going to make our family stronger, not just their abilities on the wrestling mat.”
Nonetheless, Weiss recognises points of improvement from this season. “We will reflect on where guys faltered throughout the year, and how we can be better at communicating [and] working differently with people,” he said. “I’m always trying to get better, I’m always trying to get better, get my coaches better, get my captains better.”
While the season may be over, Harvard wrestlers will continue training on the mat. Conigliaro, in reference to a Harvard wrestling alum, notes that “wrestling is an eleven-month sport — the season really never ends, the training really never stops, and we’ll be training throughout the summer as well in preparation for next year.”
Off-season training requires discipline and determination, which Conigliaro prizes about the team.
“It’s great to have so many people who are able to commit to wrestling, not only in-season but also out of season,” he said.
Armed with this season’s successes, Harvard wrestling is already keeping its eye on next year’s prize, and Weiss is hopeful for the team’s ability to improve and succeed. “Our goal is not just to get four guys at nationals. Our goal is ultimately to place guys — that’s something we’ve got to get better at,” he said. “I know there are guys on the team that should be out there next year, and we’ve got to prepare for that from here on out right now.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.
Redemption came calling for the long-patient Harvard (9-13, 2-6 EIVA) men’s volleyball team this past weekend, as the team prevailed against the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) (8-16, 2-7 EIVA) to snatch two back-to-back wins.
Following a punishing –– though exciting –– weekend against powerhouse Penn State (22-3, 8-0 EIVA), Harvard entered this past weekend with a less than stellar conference play record. The team had yet to clinch a single victory against a conference opponent, all with less than a month to go to EIVA tournament play.
As Friday night found Newark battling the lingering East Coast spring chill, Crimson waged war inside at the NJIT Wellness and Events Center.
An attack error from NJIT kicked off the match to give Harvard the early lead, and Harvard took off and ran with it. Sophomore setter James Bardin posted a solid five-point serving streak, as an equal effort from the Harvard kill and the NJIT fumble gave Harvard a strong 5-0 start, and the Highlanders used their first timeout –– one of the fastest that the Crimson has forced this season.
Though a slew of opponent grit and service errors brought the game back to a level back-and-forth, the Highlanders weren’t able to recover from the early deficit. A great set by junior Ethan Smith found its mark at the palm of Bardin, whose kill launched the start of a second siege to get the Crimson to a 14-6 lead.
The gap proved to be too large for NJIT to bridge, and after a sweet set by Bardin made way for a powerful spike by junior Trevor Schultz, Harvard captured the first set 25-19.
The Crimson found similar success in the second set, with back-to-back service aces from Schultz giving Harvard another early, comfortable lead. This time, the Highlanders fought back to overcome a 9-3 deficit, eventually capitalizing on a Bardin service error to knot the game up at 12-12.
Both teams rode a tense point-for-point segment all the way to 18-18, as the Highlanders’ persistence kept the Harvard gap from widening. However, a McGovern kill restarted the engine, fueling a four-point Harvard run to break away.
Another kill from the sophomore eventually ended the set at 25-22, once again in Harvard’s favor. Now up 2-0, Harvard’s first EIVA victory lay only one set away.
Never one to take the theater out of the play, the Crimson switched up the script in the third set to give NJIT a turn with the early lead. A service error from Harvard, coupled with a service ace by the Highlanders brought NJIT to their first 3-1 lead.
Though the Crimson battled back, it took the team until 13-13 to finally catch up to their opponents, thanks to a huge block from Bardin, Smith, and senior Ryan Hong that shut down an attempt by NJIT’s Alessandro Negri.
At this point, the Highlanders took a page out of Harvard’s own book. The two teams wrestled for dominance on the scoreboard until 18-18, where dual service aces by Martin De Chavarria –– a three-time Spanish League Champion and a former player on the Spanish Junior National Team –– set a fire under NJIT that could not be cooled. A kill from De Chavarria gave NJIT the set, 25-22, and got the Highlanders back in the match.
Aware of the danger, Harvard stuck close to NJIT in the fourth set, and a deadlocked set found its first three-point gap at 16-13 in favor of the Highlanders.
Though a kill by Hong attempted to make some headway in the difference, and the trusty triage of service errors kept the pace humble, Harvard never fully caught up in time. A kill by NJIT’s Negri snatched the set from under Harvard’s nose, ending the fourth at 25-23 and setting the stage for a winner-take-all fifth set.
Prior to New Jersey, Harvard had only won a single fifth set so far this season. The start to the fifth appeared to be a continuation of that trend, as NJIT grabbed an early 3-1 lead resembling one, not unlike that of the third set.
Harvard kept the Highlanders close, and extremely so. A bad set by NJIT setter Griffin Fieseler gave Crimson the opportunity to tie up the game at 3-3, and this time, Harvard would not let go. Though a fifth set is played to 15, the teams barreled forward into a tie at 14-14, keeping the game alive as 15-15 and 16-16 ties slipped past on the scoreboard.
A McGovern kill on a serve by first-year Zach Berty finally pushed the Crimson into their first match point. A subsequent topper by Berty allowed NJIT a chance on the attack that was swiftly blocked by the server himself, ending a grueling set at 18-16 for Harvard and giving not one, but three players –– McGovern, Berty, and Bardin –– some season-high blocking stats to go along with it.
The teams came back for another taste on Saturday. Before the match, Harvard took to the sidelines, as NJIT took the court to honor their graduating seniors and graduate students during their scheduled Senior Day.
The first set appeared to pan out almost identically to Friday, as an attack error from NJIT brought forth an early Harvard lead. After taking a shaky splash of errors to get their sea legs under them, Harvard racked up numbers on the scoreboard, as a huge kill from Smith lit the way for a four-point streak for Harvard to make it 9-5.
Another back-and-forth plagued the game pace, as the Highlanders struggled to come close to a lead. A big kill by McGovern gave Harvard a critical 20-16 lead, and only a few rallies later, Hong hit a beautiful cross-court smash that sealed NJIT’s fate, taking the first set for Harvard at 25-20.
If NJIT was intimidated by this first-set resemblance, it didn’t show. Refusing to fall back into Friday’s lacking pace, the Highlanders stuck close to Crimson numbers, as the lead swapped every few rallies.
A critical four-point streak during the latter stages of the game led through the efforts of three separate NJIT attackers, dealt a crushing blow to Harvard’s chances as the Highlanders pulled ahead at 22-20. A McGovern kill attempted to answer back, but a service error, combined with an NJIT service ace, ended the set at a close 25-22.
Harvard came back into the third set with guns blazing, as a kill by Berty seized the first lead, and the only lead, for Crimson of the set. Fueled by service errors and a healthy dose of attacking vengeance, Harvard ran up the scoreboard. A service ace by Schultz gave Harvard a 14-8 lead that only continued to grow, as another ace by McGovern found the team at 17-10.
A service error by the Highlanders brought Harvard up to 24-19, and an attack error by NJIT’s De Chavarria one play later ended up slipping harmlessly into the net, awarding the Crimson the set by a score of 25-19. The set also brought further Friday deja vu, as Harvard found itself once again two sets up, to the Highlanders' one.
If there’s one team who’d rather not relive a Friday loss, it would have to be the Jersey opposition. Where the third set had gone the way of Harvard, the fourth set would be violently torn in the other direction. From the beginning, NJIT carved out a lead that would never quite be relinquished.
Where a Berty kill had snatched a quick lead for Harvard in the last set, NJIT’s block on Berty’s kill attempt gave their fourth set a subsequent quick start. Crimson matched the Highlander’s pace until 4-4, where a tough service error by McGovern began a seven-point leak, helped along by huge NJIT block assists that was only stopped by a later McGovern kill.
This unfortunate run left the score torn apart at 11-5, and another kill by NJIT’s Jens Feldthus, one of the honored graduate students of the day, marked the beginning of another streak from which the Crimson never recovered.
The fourth set was closed out by a McGovern attack attempt that had been blocked by Feldthus and De Chavarria. Compared to a weekend lush with close sets, the ending for the fourth was more than a little demoralizing for a Harvard team that had been dominating for the majority of Friday: 25-11, in favor of NJIT.
Clearly, they were not too demoralized, however. The Highlanders initially appeared primed to run away with the match, as the team snatched an early lead in the fifth set.
Harvard and NJIT traded service errors before the Highlanders went on a tear to score four points in a row, bringing the game to a tough 7-3. The Crimson, unafraid, answered back with its own point streak, with three consecutive kills by Berty tying the game at 12-12.
A powerful ace by senior Will Polster allowed Harvard to finally pull ahead. A De Chavarria kill attempted to tie up the match again, but a huge kill by Bardin would sweep past the NJIT libero to bring Harvard up to match point, 14-13.
A serve by Bardin himself would open up the next, and final rally. A tough receive by the Highlanders gave Crimon the opening to set up an attack by Berty. The NJIT defense ran up to match Berty’s jump, but a clever tool off the blockers threw the ball out of bounds to give Harvard their final point.
The Crimson ended their final fifth set at 15-13, awarding them not only their second win of the weekend to sweep NJIT but also Harvard’s second win against a conference opponent.
“I’m really proud of the guys,” assistant coach Nick Clark stated. “It’s a challenge to play the same team on back-to-back nights. It says a lot about our resolve to win two five-set matches on the road.”
The matches against NJIT at New Jersey close out the Crimson’s road games for the season. Luckily, it’s not the last of the volleyball regular season yet. Harvard will welcome their final EIVA conference opponents –– and final opponents –– of the regular season, George Mason University, at home court in Cambridge next week.
Next weekend will also feature the team’s own Senior Day. Current seniors on the team consist of Ryan Hong and Will Polster, faces from this past match, as well as libero Alessio Pignatelli and setter Will Sorenson.
“We are looking forward to celebrating our seniors next weekend at home!” Clark remarked. And Harvard will look forward to all that and more as its season reaches a critical juncture.

It’s finally that time of year — you’re getting a little sick of waking up to your athlete roommate’s 7 a.m. MAC alarm and a call from your hometown bestie is all that you are looking forward to. Before you know it, they’re on their way to see if your red brick castle is the dark academia paradise they’ve been expecting. Here are the eight places to take them to meet (and maybe lower) their expectations.
1. Lamont Library
I know, I know, Widener is the stunning marble-crested dreamscape with sensible working hours and dashing upperclassmen… and your best friend (on campus) is probably waiting for you with an unfinished puzzle in Cabot Library. But let’s be real. When things get tough and you need to punch away at a pset for hours or grind out your expos draft, only one place feels like home. Take them to the REAL productivity zone on campus.
2. Annenberg
Like most Harvard students, your best friend from home is probably a nerd. Accept it. They stan Jar Jar Binks and think Lord of the Rings is the greatest work of fantasy of all time. More than anything else, they cried when a magical envelope didn’t welcome them to Hogwarts before puberty. Take them into HUDS paradise and watch them gawk at the stained glass windows and dark wood paneling. Smuggle them in with your friend’s ID and take them up that dingy elevator to give them a balcony overview of the ultimate Harry Potter fantasy land.
3. Your Dorm
This one is fairly straightforward, but your best friend probably thinks that you have a butler waiting on your every need and room service straight to your marble bathtub. Let them have their “Ohhhh! This is sooo cute!” moment.
4. CS50 Lecture
What’s more Harvard than taking them to the most popular lecture on campus. With your best friend added to David Malan’s fanbase, you won’t be able to get away with sleeping through lectures anymore. Even better, smuggle your friend the ultimate Harvard souvenir — an “I took CS50 shirt.”
5. Tatte’s
Introduce your BFF to hustle culture by fighting for a table at a popular cafe in Harvard Square. Some of the best tea ever spilled (quite literally when weaving through the crowd on a busy Saturday morning) was brewed on the first floor of this Harvard cult classic. Don’t be shy, climb those steps to the second floor and dish on your new college lives as you overlook Massachusetts Ave.
6. El Jefe’s
No, you are not taking your BFF to Felipe’s for dinner. I don’t care if you say the burritos are objectively more flavorful or cost-efficient, we both know that regardless of which restaurant you like better, when 3 a.m. rolls around after a long night of studying or socializing, your butt will be firmly planted in a Jefe’s booth. Don’t gatekeep the REAL Harvard experience.
7. The Stacks
Yes, I labeled Widener overrated, but there is an exception that makes this rule — the Stacks. What kind of hometown friend are we talking about? If they’re the right type of friend, this may be one Harvard tradition to show them before they leave.
8. The Quad
Field trip! Let’s reverse prejudices against this centerpiece of the Harvard community. Struggle to demonstrate an understanding of how Passio-Go works. The shuttle even doubles as a tour bus. Plus, there are many worse places to visit on campus… we highly recommend avoiding Mather at all costs during the shuttle ride.
From beating a Karen to a Tatte’s table after her pilates session to converting your BFF to a computer science major, this guide is a sure-fire way to introduce Harvard to any hometown bestie. Don’t get me wrong, Harvard’s campus truly is one of the most exceptional and beautiful places to spend your four collegiate years… but not introducing your friend to its quirks is a grave injustice.
