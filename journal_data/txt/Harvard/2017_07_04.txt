After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last April, Paradox Interactive released the first major expansion to their May 2016 4X real-time strategy game "Stellaris." It was a great game at launch, allowing players to live out their fantasies of galactic conquest through a robust, if somewhat simplistic, system of resource management, political maneuvering, and gratuitous space battles. Copious amounts of well-written science fiction pieces accompanied every major event, making the whole experience feel like a cross between a choose-your-own-adventure novel and a strategy sim on par with Firaxis’ well-respected Civilization series. In April, Paradox Interactive released two major additions to the game: one, a free patch updating the game to version 1.6 codenamed “Banks,” and the other a paid expansion adding additional gameplay and narrative content to the game called “Stellaris: Utopia.” “Utopia” builds on the changes made in “Banks,” so I’ll talk about both here.
In "Stellaris," your mission is to guide your civilization—either a predefined race or a self-created one—to galactic greatness. At the outset, you’re equipped with only two ships: one for obtaining resources, and one for exploring the vast cosmos. After making progress on the game’s truly staggering research tree, you will colonize new planets and make contact with alien lifeforms.
Unfortunately, alien contact is perhaps the least satisfying element of "Stellaris" as diplomacy is extremely limited. You can choose to wage war on another race, insult them to worsen relations, trade with them, create or join a Federation, or attempt to Vassalize them (or, if they’re strong enough, ask to become their Vassal).
In theory, these might be all the actions required to simulate a fun, if not true-to-life, version of diplomacy. But the options are often not nuanced enough to be useful in gameplay. For example, although you can offer colonized planets to other nations as part of trade deals, you cannot ask them for the same. If a planet has already been colonized by another empire, the only to attain it is through war. This limitation means that towards the late-game, when most systems are under the control of one empire or another, the only way to expand an empire is war. By this point, diplomacy in “Stellaris” isn’t just lackluster, but actively annoying.
The original "Stellaris" also suffered from a lack of interesting mid-to-late game content and a user interface that didn’t provide enough functionality. Without “Utopia” or the accompanying “Banks” update, micromanaging perhaps dozens of units to explore and study the galaxy in the late-game lost the excitement of the early-game. Instead of an exercise in decision-making and the wonder of discovery, the micromanagement of Science Ships to explore the universe, scan solar systems for resources or habitable worlds, and research anomalies becomes an annoying distraction from the more interesting events that occur as your empire becomes more powerful and the galaxy grows older.
Though diplomacy remains for the most part basic, "Stellaris: Utopia” and the 1.6 “Banks” update released alongside it for the base game is a literal game-changer in almost every part of gameplay. “Banks” provided much-needed polish to the user interface, and indeed changed the structure of the game itself in too many subtle but important ways to count. It also entirely reworked the initially simplistic Government system into one which allowed the player to make more interesting decisions.
The most interesting change in “Banks” was the introduction of factions, which represent the political reality that not all members of an empire will believe in the same things. Your empire could be materialistic and warmongering, but anywhere from a few to most of your population might instead be collectivist and pacifist. Your responses to the factions and events which occur in your empire will create and influence factions. This makes your empire feel much more alive, and makes you think twice about unilaterally deciding to start wars or engage in gene modification.
The Utopia expansion works to build on these changes and diversify the player’s control over the narrative of their empire, as well as adding events to the galaxy which contributes to the overall story of the world you inhabit in "Stellaris.” “Utopia” adds a host of late-game upgrades called “Ascension Perks” which give the player something constructive to work towards after their empire reaches its late-game stage, but before the galactic crises—any one of a number of what are essentially game-ending surprises—start to emerge. This makes the late-game experience much more consistent, and allows the player to continue to develop the narrative of their species by focusing on, well, ascending, in one of a variety of ways. If you focused on computer technologies and artificial intelligence, you might replace your species with a race of technologically enhanced organics; if you focused on gene modification, your entire race might evolve into a superior form with upgraded statistics and new bonuses.
“Utopia” also introduces a number of megastructures to the game, which are special stations with incredible build costs but high rewards. You can build habitable planetoids, Dyson Spheres, and other wacky contraptions straight out of science fiction. This helps to address the problem of late-game expansion that I mentioned earlier—where you lose the ability to expand your population as the number of unclaimed habitable worlds approaches zero, and prohibitively expensive terraforming operations become tedious—though it doesn’t quite make up for the inadequacies of the diplomatic system. It comes pretty close, though.
I’ve poured many, many hours into "Stellaris,” and I can tell you that it’s worth your time. Performance tends to sharply drop towards the late game, as the engine has to simulate more and more AI movement and the number of calculations it has to make increases, but there are whispers that performance might be improved with later patches. The developers are still very much engaged with the game, and maintain an active Facebook presence, posting “Dev Diaries” every so often to keep fans apprised of design decisions and to provide teasers of new features. The modding scene, particularly on Steam, is vibrant, with everything from a “Rick and Morty” empire to a total-conversion Star Trek mod available for download, for free. All in all, it’s a great game, and with the Steam Summer Sale in full swing there’s never been a better time to get it.
“Stellaris” is normally $39.99 on Steam, but is discounted to $19.99 until July 5th. “Stellaris: Utopia” is normally $19.99, but until July 5th is discounted to $17.99.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Robin Hood never had another name—as far as we’re told. In our childhoods, there was only one acceptable version of his story, and it was channeled through a whitewashed vessel, where pallid tongues and bleached palms cradled the tale from one set of wide young eyes to the next. Robin Hood was the tragic hero, the delinquent iconoclast, the arrow of hope arching from the poor to the rich and boomeranging back with hope to thread their clothes into something more than just rags. His story is powerful and touching and sows seeds of resistance against “the system” in the next generation. But whom is this story for? Who receives the privileged notion that if you steal from the rich and give to the poor you will be remembered for the charitable life you lived?
There’s another version of this story.
Once upon a time, there was a man named Guachito Gil—the Argentinian “Robin Hood,” if you will (although in that appositive lies the same problem). A war hero weary of war, Gil left the battlefield and turned to a life of crime in an attempt to provide for those in la pobreza—poverty—taking from the rich and giving to the poor. A familiar narrative, perhaps. Gil also was purported to have magical healing powers, amplifying the sentiment behind his curing of the poor. However, Gauchito Gil was caught by the police and his throat slit, despite being pardoned and promising to heal the son of the sergeant. After he had passed, the sergeant found his son cured and made it his life goal to honor this miracle by preserving Gil’s memory.
Unlike Robin Hood, Gil is venerated for the significance of his death, the importance of his character relying more on his mysterious powers to heal rather than the healing itself. Unlike Robin Hood, Gil and those in poverty aren’t the winners of the legend.
At Harvard, our methods of fighting against hierarchies of power vary. We rally in front of Harvard Hall and the John Harvard statue, participate in strikes and sit-ins—our arrows and bows being petitions for change and sanctions against exclusivity. An unfortunate majority of the time these opinions are heard but are not acted upon. In the recent past, students have rallied in support of being named a sanctuary campus, divesting from fossil fuels, paying fair wages during the HUDS strike, establishing bridge programs, and other causes. The list extends for a hapless length of time. Rarely have these efforts garnered the intended results.
In this sense, the Robin Hood of our childhoods incites us to continue the struggle against “the system” in hopes that our rallies, our protests, and our words make a difference. The seeds that were sown in our respective youths flourish under this light, with the idea that fighting against the richness in power that is the administration while enriching poorly constructed spaces—academic spheres with the bridge program and comfort for undocumented students—will lead to not only change, but admirable change.
Yet, perhaps we are more like Gauchito Gil in the sense that although we try to rectify what we see as faultlines in the system, the system still quakes with our finger extended outward, gesturing furiously at it. In spite of our attempts to try and change what we believe could be bettered in our university, what is memorialized and what is remembered is simply the death of them—a tombstone heading consisting of a Crimson news headline and a photo of the protest. It’s rarely the change itself.
Some argue that the best of stories have happy endings. The underdog wins the challenge, the guy gets the girl, the good wins over bad. I like that idea—that good stories have good endings—but when I look down my feet are touching the ground, not the clouds.
The other day we went as a group to visit La Casa Rosada, the office of the Argentinian president. Outside the gates of the impressive building, a group was stirring, shouting, rallying—comparing President Macri to el naranjito Trump, calling for change. Some took photos, others stood by and watched. The security guards paid them little to no mind, and hardly anyone of political importance could even hear their thoughts. Some might argue that their presence was useless, their cries falling on deaf ears.
Yet, they continued to speak—and I listened. I wrote about it. And I think that means something.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Fox Club will not allow the nine women who had enjoyed “provisional” status in the group to become full members, effectively expelling the women and marking the club’s return to all-male status almost two years after it first became co-ed.
The move, detailed in internal correspondence between recent Fox graduates, ends the club’s experiment in co-ed membership, which began in October 2015 when undergraduates admitted a group of upperclassmen women as members. That decision deeply divided the club, pitting graduate and undergraduate members against each other as Harvard administrators pressured final clubs to go gender-neutral.
Ultimately, the club’s graduate leadership allowed the women to stay on as “provisional” members—a designation that many male members also adopted at the time in a show of support for their female peers. But the club did not invite any more women to join the club, accepting an all-male class of membership last fall.
Now, the graduate board is revoking membership for all “provisional” members and inviting only men to re-apply for full membership, according to screenshots of correspondence between recent Fox graduates obtained by The Crimson.
In those messages, former Fox undergraduate president Daniel T. Skarzynski ’16 wrote that club graduate board president Hugh M. Nesbit ’77 had  informed him that provisional female and male graduate members no longer belonged to the club.
“For the concerned parties, [Nesbit] also said that if you’d like to be re-considered for membership, you should send an email to that effect… and that the grad board will vote individually,” Skarzynski wrote. “However, he said this invite for reapplication does not apply to female members until such a time as the club votes successfully to add women to its membership.”
Nesbit and Skarzynski did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
According to one male Fox graduate, granted anonymity to discuss confidential club proceedings, some "provisional" male members may not reapply for membership until the women are also allowed to reapply.
Douglas W. Sears ’69, who served as president of the graduate board when the women joined the club, criticized the decision to remove the female members.
“Some folks certainly know how to get on the wrong side of history voluntarily,” he said.
Efforts to fully integrate women as members of the Fox Club have repeatedly stalled.  In August 2016, a resolution to alter the club’s by-laws to allow female members narrowly failed to garner the two-thirds majority it needed to pass. Undergraduate members also voted against adding women to the club in a separate, non-binding vote in May 2017.
The Fox’s reestablishment of single-gender membership comes just two months before the arrival of the Class of 2021, the first to be affected by an administrative policy penalizing involvement in single-gender final clubs. That policy, announced in May 2016, will bar members of single-gender social organizations from holding leadership positions in recognized student groups and from receiving College endorsement for several prestigious fellowships like the Rhodes and the Marshall.
Administrators had already started pushing clubs to become co-ed in the fall of 2015, though, when undergraduate Fox leadership cited administrative pressure as a key reason behind their decision to unilaterally add women to the club.
“Independent of the undergraduates’ sincere desire to admit women, Harvard University has applied tremendous pressure on all of the clubs to go co-ed,” Fox undergraduates wrote at the time in a letter to club graduates explaining their decision. “We now believe that our individual reputations and careers, as well as the reputation, autonomy and existence of the Fox Club going forward, are at serious risk if we do not act.”
Efforts to persuade single-gender clubs to embrace gender neutrality have achieved mixed results to date. Though four groups have adopted gender neutral policies since administrators debuted the sanctions, several other organizations remain committed to maintaining their single-gender status. At least one final club has retained attorneys in anticipation of a potential legal battle over the policy.
The decision to revoke membership for the women seems to place the Fox at odds with Harvard’s sanctions once again—though the College’s social group policy could change. In January 2017, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced the creation of a committee that could revise or replace Harvard’s penalties for members of single-gender social groups.
The faculty committee is set to deliver its recommendations this fall.
