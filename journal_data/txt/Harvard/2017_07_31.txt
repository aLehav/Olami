After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It hurts to think back to election night. After a few hours of watching the votes come in with the people I’d spent countless hours on the campaign trail with, the results were becoming clear.
The room felt suffocating, so I decided to take a walk alone. For a few minutes, I strolled along the Charles River, watching the soft glow from Weeks Bridge as an existential dread formed in my stomach. I walked in a heavy silence, thinking about the organizing and campaigning we’d done, realizing that, although ultimately not enough, we’d given it our all.
Katy Perry had a different election night, one that marked the end of her superficial campaign efforts—an uninspiring performance at the Democratic National Convention, some selfies, and bizarre attempts to get her fans to vote. She held Lady Gaga’s hand in the Javits Center as the results came in, and said it was “traumatizing” when she heard that Senator Hillary R. Clinton would not be arriving to give an acceptance speech. She claims that the night was an “awakening” for her and that she’s tried reflecting that in her new album, “Witness.”
A senior editor at Pitchfork wrote in a review of the album that “[Katy Perry’s] stated goal of making woke pop is, depending on how cynical you are, either admirable or shameless (or both), but either way, it’s not terribly effective.” The album fails because Perry does not follow through on her commitment to social justice; she simply uses it as a selling point. On the album, she’s featured homophobic artists, which seems to be in line with a career marked by anti-gay lyrics and blatant cultural appropriation. Katy Perry uses the so-called Resistance as a way of updating her brand, marketing her music, and making money.
When Katy Perry’s performance—including painfully unoriginal statements on freedom on the Fourth of July—isn’t accepted as genuine, she gets frustrated and accuses critics of issuing vindictive “clapbacks” for the sake of conflict. Instead of focusing on what she can do for social justice, she worries about why people aren’t believing her act.
President Donald Trump is an easy punching bag—even Perry has taken her shots—which has made it easy to shirk personal responsibility to social justice while also claiming to care about progressive causes. Denouncing Trump is easy. Actively working against the sexism, xenophobia, and racism that fueled his political success is much harder and doesn’t happen as often. The Women’s Marches in January were powerful acts of protest, but they were still very white and cisgender. The impressive attendance at them was marred by the sense that some were only there for the the photo-op. There’s been a spike in these “performative progressives,” who strive to say the right thing without taking substantive action.
Katy Perry is one of the most high-profile examples of this phenomenon, but she’s far from the only one. Kendall Jenner commodified the protests sweeping the country in an attempt to sell Pepsi. A recent SNL sketch depicted men at a bar who flirt with a woman by uttering popular feminist phrases before calling that woman a “bitch” when she rejects their advances. In New York City’s Washington Square Park last weekend, I saw a woman selling $3 “Pins for the Resistance,” and people lined up to buy them. The political movement for equality has slowly transformed itself into an aesthetic that allows people to be progressive on paper while upholding the status quo in person.
At Harvard, this attitude is clearest among discussions about final clubs. Although membership processes premised on gender exclusion and wealth generally select for a more conservative ideology, many final club members identify as progressive. They support progressive causes online and through membership in political groups on campus, but their performance ends as soon as they join a club. Their actions support institutions that foster class exclusion, gender discrimination, and unhealthy social dynamics on campus. They’re progressive, but incredibly selective in their causes, which makes their work feel like a show.
The faculty recommendation to phase out social groups brought another set of “performative progressives” to the forefront. These individuals are progressive in most cases, writing passionately on Facebook about gender, sexuality, and racial equality, but turn a blind eye when discussing the exclusionary culture surrounding final clubs. Perhaps it’s because their social lives center around Mount Auburn St. Maybe they have friends in clubs who they see as good people, which blinds them to the structural issues that plague clubs. Maybe the idea of social exclusion doesn’t seem antithetical to their progressive ideals, as if elitism weren’t founded on power imbalances. They say the “right” things, but then turn around and defend institutions that represent everything progressive movements aim to change.
The Resistance, the movement, the cause—use your term of choice—is not about individual gain or bolstering personal image. The ultimate goal should be the betterment of the oppressed—criminal justice reform, curtailment of sexism, equality in both principle and practice. Performative and selective progressives, with their hollow words and convenient blind spots, do nothing to bring us closer to these goals. It’s time we stop performing our politics and instead head to the streets as organizers, protesters, and community builders dedicated to making real progress.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In the latest twist in &pizza’s quest to open in the Brattle St. location that formerly housed newsstand Crimson Corner and restaurant Tory Row, the D.C.-based pizza chain has received preliminary approval for a Harvard Square location.
The Cambridge Planning Board earlier this month voted to approve the proposed restaurant, a partnership between &pizza and Milk Bar, a dessert bakery based in New York.
It said the revised proposal included “specific and material changes”—a necessary condition for the Cambridge Board of Zoning Appeal to reconsider the case. The zoning board had previously denied the solo &pizza bid in late April, prompting the restaurant chain to re-apply with the proposed Milk Bar partnership. The hearing before the Board of Zoning Appeals will occur on August 10.
Harvard Square Business Association Executive Director Denise A. Jillson said the “milk &pizza” concept meets their requirements, which include early openings, late closings, a three-season patio, and a reasonably-priced menu.
The Harvard Square Advisory Committee, which had approved the previous plan, voted 5-3 to endorse their new proposal.
Others are more cautious about the decision.
Suzanne P. Blier, a Harvard professor who founded the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, said the &pizza decision “exemplifies a wholesale shift in Harvard Square’s culture and character from largely locally owned unique businesses to national chains.” She noted that of four new food businesses opening soon, only one is local.
“When greedy landlords raise leases to the point that only national fast food chains and banks can afford to do business here it is a problem for the community,” Blier wrote in an email. &pizza, she predicted, “will likely force out popular local pizzerias.”
Though there are currently five pizzerias in the square, Jillson argued that “it should be less about what they serve, but how they serve it.”
“We’re thankful for the endorsements from the Harvard Square Advisory Board and Planning Board and look forward to sharing our new plans with the Board of Zoning Appeals,” &pizza wrote in a statement.
Jillson said she appreciated the feedback from residents.
“Good for the community for speaking out for what they want and good for &pizza for responding so affirmatively,” she said.
