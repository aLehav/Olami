After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following the 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, American politics has been characterized by the spending of vast and ever-growing sums of money. We live in a country that has seen a $2 billion presidential campaign, a country that a former president believes has become an oligarchy. Knowing this, it is easy, even obvious, to call for some type of campaign finance reform.
The most immediate responses in the Democratic Party have been calls to remove the problem, overturning Citizens United by constitutional amendment. While this seems the neatest solution to the problem, it is not the only one being put forward. Harvard’s own Lawrence Lessig proposed the Citizen Equality Act of 2017, which would include sweeping electoral and campaign finance reforms, and though his presidential bid seems a far-fetched prospect, he has pointed out that a constitutional amendment is even more unlikely. Part of the danger of Citizen’s United is it raises the threshold for becoming a serious candidate, allowing wealthy elites to act as gatekeepers for the ballot. Three candidates this election cycle have successfully circumvented the gate: Bernie Sanders and Larry Lessig by collecting small sums from many donors, and Donald Trump by financing himself.
It is easy to get discouraged. If our country’s best hope is either a constitutional amendment or the long-shot presidential candidacy of a Harvard professor, perhaps we cannot truly fix our broken system. Sooner or later, something similarly far-fetched may in fact be necessary. It is possible, however, that this is not the case. The American people seem, almost by accident, to have stumbled onto a different solution, one that recognizes that the majority of Americans are not wealthy individuals or members of well-funded interest groups, and we are still a country ruled by the majority of voters.
Frustration with our political system is palpable in the United States, and it starts with the growing feeling of irrelevance among individual voters. In a country where campaign donations by wealthy individuals, corporations, super PACs, and the like easily reach into seven figures, what hope does the average person have of influencing an election?
The answer, as evidenced by post-2012 political campaigns, seems to be quite a lot. In the early part of the 2016 presidential election cycle, candidates who base their campaigns on separation from the establishment have been remarkably successful. From 2008 on, President Obama has been accused many times of being a socialist. In 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders, self-proclaimed socialist, is a serious candidate for the Democratic nomination, even passing Hillary Clinton in some polls. Larry Lessig set out to raise $1 million in small donations by Labor Day, promising to pass sweeping electoral and campaign finance reforms and then turn the presidency over to his future running mate. Lessig met his goal a day early, without huge donations by wealthy donors (but with $30 from me).
Even Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has touched on the issue of campaign finance. While many may accuse him of using wealth to influence American politics, what better person is there to highlight such problems than Trump? What better way to point out the frequency of influence-buying than to have a buyer tell his story? Trump is everything wrong with American politics, and he is not averse to demonstrating that himself.
The way Americans can save ourselves is by refusing to sell and remembering who we are. Candidates from outside the paradigm of American partisan politics, such as Sanders, Lessig, or (though it pains me to admit it) even Trump, can upset the system even if they do not win, by inspiring citizens to become voters, and voters to become candidates. Candidates farther from Washington’s establishment and closer to average citizens can not only fight more effectively for average citizens’ interests, but inspire those citizens to fight for themselves. Air time, media coverage, campaign resources, and the like may be for sale, but our individual votes are not.
Come next November, let us use those votes to take our democracy back.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Three years ago, a small group of student leaders—tired of seeing their and the world’s future sold out—created Divest Harvard. Its goal was (and remains) simple: make the case that the time has come for Harvard to stop investing in the fossil fuel industry, and, in doing so, educate the campus and the public about climate change, grow a grassroots movement to face down institutional complacency, and, ultimately, produce a paradigm shift in the popular psychology and politics of climate change globally.
When Divest Harvard began, few had heard of divestment, and the idea of fossil fuel divestment was largely untested. In three years, much has changed. The movement has gone global. So far some 400 institutions have committed to divest from some or all fossil fuels, according to gofossilfree.org. Thousands more campaigns are active.
Over the summer, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Canadian Medical Association committed to divestment, and an internal committee at MIT recommended to divest from coal and tar sands. Many other universities have already moved forward on divestment, including the University of Oxford, Georgetown University, and Stanford University. Last week, the California legislature voted to divest its public pension funds from coal. And the movement has been endorsed by the UN’s climate change chief Christiana Figueres, Special Envoy for Climate Change Mary Robinson, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and the World Bank’s president Jim Yong Kim, among others. Despite these developments, however, Harvard has not yet made a forward move on divestment.
Who decides what Harvard does about its investments in fossil fuels? The answer is the Harvard Corporation, including Harvard’s president, Drew Faust. Over the past three years, they have come up with an ever-changing list of reasons why Harvard can’t divest. Those reasons have become less and less compelling as institutions globally—both bigger and smaller than Harvard—move forward on divestment.
The rationale for divestment is pretty straightforward. Today, we can see the effects of the last generation’s short-sighted development of fossil fuels, ranging from the intensity of the current drought in California, to extreme flooding in places like the Philippines, to recent droughts in the Middle East that have triggered violent conflict and the exodus of refugees. These examples serve to illustrate that although human-caused climate change is new, the face of it is not: to individuals, climate change is poverty, desperation, organized killing, the death of family members, and so on.
I myself have talked to parents in the Philippines who have had to collect their children’s decomposing bodies after an extreme flood. I’ve also seen the children who survive such events—homeless and stuck in poverty. These are the burdens we place on the next generation by promoting fossil fuel development. Is this what we at Harvard should be promoting? And is this what Harvard should be profiting from? We owe it to those parents and those children to ask ourselves these questions.
So far, the Harvard Corporation’s granddaddy excuse for not divesting—the one that can’t be proved or disproved—is that Harvard’s divestment would not ultimately matter in the fight against climate change, so we might as well keep making money from fossil fuels. In making this excuse, the Harvard Corporation—keen to promote Harvard as a trendsetter and a force for global good in almost every other situation—seems to lack a basic grasp of what leadership and responsibility mean. It’s an excuse that should make us at Harvard feel embarrassed—and perhaps a little ashamed—because we know that the example Harvard sets does, in fact, matter. And the rest of the world does, too.
Today, we understand the dangerous effects of fossil fuel development. Yet institutional norms still say that to invest in and profit from such development—while making others deal with the consequences—is a completely acceptable behavior. That norm has to change, and this is precisely how Harvard can make a difference with divestment.
As it stands, Harvard’s lack of forward movement on its fossil fuel investment policy is being used as an excuse by other universities not to act. Even the Independent Petroleum Association of America has the Harvard Corporation’s words displayed on one of its websites, urging institutions not to divest.
When the push for divestment at Harvard began three years ago, the Harvard Corporation hoped it would go away. It hasn’t. It’s become a global force. And the Harvard Corporation’s insistence on investing in fossil fuels gives our Harvard community neither the moral high ground nor the intellectual high ground. We can do better.
This year, join Divest Harvard as we push the administration to show the leadership it’s capable of and stop investing in fossil fuels. We have an opportunity—and a duty—to make a big difference on the issue of our time, and we don’t have time to waste.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a former member of the all-male Hasty Pudding Theatricals cast (2004–2007), I would like to commend the women who signed up to audition for this year’s Hasty Pudding production. I am thrilled to hear that their act of civil disobedience has earned them audition slots for this year’s production. This is not the first time, though, that the Pudding has allowed women to audition for the company, and even as they’ve let women audition in the past, they have yet to actually cast one. I am hopeful that this time around, the auditions will be more than a token gesture. It’s long past time to offer equal opportunity to men and women to participate fully in this revered institution.
I would like to think that for the vast majority of Harvard students, this would be a no-brainer. To deny women a chance to perform alongside men is patently discriminatory and therefore unacceptable; that should be the end of the discussion.
But I remember thinking, when I was a student, that to allow women into the cast would somehow compromise the “character” of the Pudding. At one point, I casually observed, “Women in drag aren’t funny.”
I wince at this mindset. First, deferring to tradition over inclusion doesn’t exactly bring to mind anyone terribly sympathetic. (If George Wallace were a drag queen, where do you think he’d fall on this issue?) Second, the strength and popularity of the Pudding hardly rests (completely) on the monumental comic power of men in dresses. The Pudding owes its success to the talent and professionalism of its creative teams—its writers, its directors, and its visionary designers—and its performers. Broadening that talent pool would in no way hurt the quality of its productions.
There is certainly a more palpable comic tradition, for whatever reason, of men in drag than of women in drag. But that comic tradition is not under attack here; no one is asking the Pudding to put an end to cross-dressing. And even if we allow for the idea, true or not, that society thinks men in skirts are funnier than women in suits, there’s no reason to think that including women in the cast would make the show any less funny. Under the current policy, the next Tina Fey would be barred from appearing on the Pudding stage.
The idea of a show cast purely on the basis of who would be funniest in any given role, gender aside, would be immensely appealing to me as both an actor and an audience member. (For the record, I think I’ve only once seen a show that featured a woman in comic drag. She was great. Funny is funny.)
There does not seem to be any reason why, with a little boldness in leadership, this can’t happen now. While I am not familiar with the minutiae of producing for the Pudding, the Pudding president’s claim that allowing women to perform would require “structural changes to the production, the company, and our larger institutional traditions” isn’t immediately convincing. What structural changes?
The Pudding has a choice: it can continue putting on professional-grade productions stocked with enormous talent while being inclusive of all students and rejuvenating both itself and drag as a form of comedy, or it can continue going the way of the country clubs, excluding women for the sake of “tradition” and some nebulous ideas about the Pudding’s aesthetic.
Keeping in mind that sooner or later the Pudding will stop discriminating against women (because it’s 2015), that we will all one day be embarrassed to have ever defended such discrimination, and that this will all be on Google, I strongly urge the Pudding leadership to give legitimate, equal consideration to the women who want to perform with the Pudding and take full advantage of all the opportunities our organization has to offer.
Let’s get with it already. The Lampoon figured this out forty years ago.
Benjamin K. Kawaller '07 graduated with a degree in sociology. He performed in four Hasty Pudding Theatricals productions, 156-159. He is a writer living in Los Angeles.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If you’re a woman, chances are you’ve been called a slut.
Women who have slept with 10 men have been called sluts. Women who have slept with one man have been called sluts. Women who have never had sex have been called sluts. Eleven-year-old girls have been called sluts. Laura Ingraham was called a slut by Ed Schultz, simply because she was politically conservative. Sandra Fluke was called a slut by Rush Limbaugh, simply because she supported access to birth control.
I’ve been called a slut, too.
In the first op-ed I wrote for The Crimson, I briefly mentioned that feminism is important to me because it gives me freedom, including the “freedom to have as many sexual partners as I want without being looked down on.” I thought it was clear from this statement, given the context, that I was pointing out the double standard when it comes to male and female sexuality, and the fact that men are not subject to the same judgment and disapproval that women receive for having multiple sexual partners.
Unfortunately, that meaning was lost on some readers—in particular, a journalist and conservative commentator named Robert Stacy McCain. He incorrectly interpreted my statement to mean that I wanted to engage in promiscuous activity, and that other people were not allowed to have their own opinions about my behavior.
McCain responded to my article by writing a blog post titled “Harvard Sluts and the Thought Police.” In his blog post, he accused me of being sexually promiscuous and he derided me and other Ivy League girls for being unclean and immoral.
He railed against “those tramps at Princeton” and the “floozies at Cornell” and the “vile hussies” at Harvard who “[put] out for every random guy in Cambridge” and are a “public health menace.” He ended his piece by saying that nothing is as “dangerous as having sex with a nasty Harvard slut,” and I can only assume he was referring to me.
However, in the comments section below, it appears that Robert Stacy McCain would actually risk that danger. In his comment, McCain said that he saw a picture of me online, and he conceded: “I’d hit it, after wrapping myself head-to-toe in latex and spraying her with Lysol.”
I cannot deny that I am disgusted by his spiteful comments. However, I am also grateful. It is people like McCain who give me the motivation, the drive, and the passion to continue writing about gender inequality. It is people like him who make me realize just how real the gender double standards are, even at this day and age, and just how important the feminist movement is.
It is ironic that McCain, in writing this blog post, presented such an excellent real-world example of exactly the type of double-standard phenomenon I wrote about in my op-ed.
In response to my innocuous statement about the societal double standard regarding male and female sexuality, McCain attacked me for being sexually promiscuous. It seems that accusing me of excessive sexual activity was the easiest way for McCain to smear my reputation and discredit my opinion.
This is, sadly, true for all women in our society. The fastest way to bring down a woman—any woman, of any age, for any reason—is by calling her a slut.
Men of different political stripes such as Ed Schultz and Rush Limbaugh employed this method in dealing with women they disagreed with. Even women use this term against other women, as a way to tear down someone they envy or dislike.
The same, however, does not hold true for men. One commenter on McCain’s  blog unwittingly provided an excellent example of the double standard, saying of me: “I also have to wonder what her parents make of her demands. She seems to put more emphasis on her sex life than on her education and career. Sounds a little skewed to me.”
You know what sounds a little skewed to me? I mean, besides the fact that you think I don’t put emphasis on my education and career when I am studying at Harvard and have seven internships under my belt. No, it’s the fact that you’re worried about what my parents think of their adult daughter for writing about sexual inequality, but you’re not worried about what McCain’s six children think of their 56-year old father for saying he’d like to have sex with an 18-year old college freshman.
Somehow, male sexuality seems less dangerous, less taboo, and less inappropriate than female sexuality. McCain’s desire to “hit it, after wrapping myself head-to-toe in latex and spraying her with Lysol” seems more acceptable than my desire to have the “freedom to have as many sexual partners as I want without being looked down on.”
While I am glad that McCain has embraced his sexuality, I wish that he and the rest of our society would extend the same courtesy to me. If he is allowed to be a sexual being, then why am I not allowed to be one? Why do women get shamed for their sexuality when men do not?
This double standard is exemplified in the words we use to describe those who have multiple sexual partners. For women, “whore” and “tramp” have decidedly negative undertones, suggesting contamination and lowliness. For men, however, “womanizer” or “player” are much more positive, evoking conquest and domination.
Slut-shaming, as a phenomenon, is uniquely directed towards women. It is defined as the idea of shaming women for being sexual, having multiple sexual partners, acknowledging sexual feelings, or acting upon those sexual feelings. In other words, we shame women for acting as sexual subjects, rather than the sexual objects they are expected to be.
Sexual objects are the sexy female models whose breasts, butts, and legs are used to sell things like milk, deodorant, and cars. They are meant to turn other people on; they are not meant to be turned on themselves. In our society, we expect women to be sexual objects. Women are meant to be sexy to other people, but they are not meant to enjoy sex themselves. I’m meant to be seen as sexy by Robert Stacy McCain, but I sure as hell am not meant to enjoy sex myself.
Sexual subjects, on the other hand, have sexual desires, pursue sex, and enjoy sex. Sound familiar? That’s right. Women who choose to act as sexual subjects are the very same ones we call sluts. And in desiring the “freedom to have as many sexual partners as I want without being looked down on,” I made myself a sexual subject. I became a slut.
If enjoying sex makes me a slut, then I’m glad to be one. But I want to live in a world where enjoying sex isn’t just a privilege reserved for men. I want to live in a world where female masturbation is just as accepted as male masturbation is, a world where women watching porn isn’t considered unusual, a world where depictions of female pleasure in movies get the same PG-13 rating that depictions of male pleasure do, a world where it’s acceptable for women to have casual sex the same way men can. I want to live in a world where women can simply admit that yes, they want sex just as much as anyone else.
Unfortunately, that just isn’t the world we live in right now. And historically, that hasn’t been what the world looked like. For centuries, female sexuality has been repressed and controlled. Under the patriarchy, where women were nothing more than property her father intended to pass down to a male heir, a woman’s virginity was paramount. What husband would want a wife who has already slept with another man? What husband would want “damaged goods?”
Therefore, the control of female sexuality was central to the patriarchy. A father was expected to safeguard his daughter’s virginity and ensure her sexual purity by secluding her from the rest of society, closing her off from educational and career opportunities. Should the daughter somehow find a way to have sex before marriage, the father, along with his sons, might even murder her in an “honor killing.”
In describing the patriarchy, I use the past tense because, though it still exists, it no longer manifests itself so overtly in places like the United States. However, for many girls and women in other parts of the world, this is still very much so their reality.
Though time has passed and things have largely improved for women in places like the United States, vestiges of the patriarchy still remain in our customs and habits—and while some are harmless, others are considerably less so. We continue to wear white at weddings, we continue to have fathers escort the brides down the aisle, we continue to hold purity balls—but most importantly, we continue to slut-shame.
We, as a society, can do better. And we, as individuals, can definitely do better. As long as people like Robert Stacy McCain continue to uphold outmoded sexist values and reinforce double standards, you can bet there will be people like me (and, hopefully, you) challenging those beliefs and working towards a world of greater gender equality—a world where sexuality is embraced as a natural and wonderful thing, not targeted as a source of shame, for men and women alike.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Now that Harvard’s Dunsterites have settled into daily life in their newly renovated dorm, evaluations of the House’s recent renovation can delve beyond the superficial. Two weeks since move-in day, many residents’ initial enchantment with the House’s lodge-like aesthetic and picturesque courtyard has been dulled by some disappointment. Though an impressive feat and a truly beautiful restoration, the Dunster House renovation is also evidence of a kink in the administration’s ability to take student desires into consideration in constructing usable living and public spaces.
Dunster today is striking, and countless aspects of the new house are a success. Perhaps the most notable improvement is that the building is now the fourth fully accessible house on campus. Both we and individual students have in the past called for more accessible spaces, and the new Dunster represents a key step in the direction of inclusivity,
Beyond this improvement, praiseworthy new features of the house include luxuriously decorated public living rooms, a stately library, a basement gym, and refurbished facilities throughout the building. In addition, the House’s ceiling fans, brand new furniture, and hardwood floors are generous and appreciated additions.
Dunster’s aesthetic beauty and new features, however, belie its fundamentally disappointing use of space. Pool tables and seminar rooms come at the price of in-suite common space for students.
An article on the official website of the Dunster House renovation describes the administration’s desires to “closely examine, renew, and reinvest in the Harvard undergraduate experience.” In theory, this means that the administration attempts to cull feedback from students regarding the recent renovations of Stone and McKinlock Halls to gauge what students most value about their living spaces.
But in practice, though the University has made a point to ask upperclassmen what they value in their housing communities, the Dunster floor plan misses the mark in attempting to provide students with the kind of social “meeting spaces” they desire.
In the new Dunster, the private common space that comes with having an in-suite common room is virtually nonexistent for many. While some lucky blocking groups inhabit enviable suites featuring separate common rooms and bedrooms, other seniors are forced to settle into shoebox-like singles. Unsurprisingly, these students feel that the University should have developed floor plans with a more critical eye.
Dunster has no shortage of public seating, quiet study space, and hybrids of the two in its new iteration. But public spaces like the booths and bar stools populating every corner of Dunster are distinct from the kind of community space that is an in-suite common room. While the former is welcome and useful, many students value the latter most.
Private social spaces are few and far between on Harvard’s undergraduate campus, and party-goers in search of hosts often have to turn to final clubs and similarly exclusive organizations. For students who do not or cannot access such groups, it has become even more difficult than it already was to procure space for a social gathering that is large enough to comfortably house a blocking group and their companions, yet private enough to avoid a stilted feeling of formality.
That Dunster House’s facilities have improved tremendously as a result of its renovation is unquestionable. But the administration should take advantage of the yearlong lull in renovations to solicit more and more targeted input from students on future projects. House renewal holds much promise, but its focus must shift to ensure that student priorities like in-suite common rooms continue to be fixtures of Harvard life.

Alongside the paper posters and calendars that usually adorn Harvard students' dorm room walls now hang some real works of art—original prints of famous paintings by Andy Warhol and Pablo Picasso, rented from the Harvard Art Museums.
Over the course of two days in early September, the Harvard Art Museums rented out 167 of 275 original prints they offered to students through its student print rental program, reestablished after a seven-year hiatus during the museums’ renovation and expansion.
The rental program, which is open to all undergraduate and graduate students living in Harvard-managed housing, rents original prints from the museums’ collection to students for the full academic year. The program offered prints from artists such as Josef Albers, Alexander Calder, Picasso, and Warhol.
Over the summer, the Harvard Art Museums publicized the program through student email lists. Students signed up for time slots at the Art Study Center, where they could browse the collection of works offered.
Jessica M. Diedalis, the Harvard Art Museums’ curricular registrar, said the use of the study center was a departure from previous years, when large crowds gathered in the museums’ central courtyard for the event.
An anonymous donation to the Fogg Art Museum established the print rental program, which dates back to 1972, according to Diedalis. The donor, who made a gift for the acquisition of prints by contemporary American artists, stipulated that the museum make them available to students.
Prior to the Harvard Art Museums’ temporary suspension of the print rental program in 2008, renting prints cost between $25 and $100, depending on size, according to Jennifer Allen, the Harvard Art Museums’ director of collections management.
While the reestablished program has set a $50 universal rental fee for the maintenance and care of each print, acquiring these works can cost “well over” that price, according to Allen.
Other schools, including Williams and MIT, also offer their own student art rental programs through university art collections, she said.
Undergraduates said renting original prints from museums created more welcoming spaces in their dorm rooms.
McKinley O. Rodriguez ’18, who rented a Picasso print, said renting prints “would be a great opportunity to have something more special than just a poster.”
Brandon A. Wright ’18, who rented a print by Robert Freimarck, was also surprised by the wide variety of prints offered to students.
“Harvard has so many resources, obviously, but [the student rental program] is one of those examples where I was surprised at how available those resources are to us,” Wright said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 9, 2015, 10:35 p.m.
CLAREMONT, N.H.—Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig officially announced his presidential bid here Wednesday in the sweltering heat to a few dozen of his supporters, reiterating his commitment to campaign finance reform and equalizing voting rights.
In his outdoor speech, about 115 miles northwest of Boston, Lessig repeated that America’s democracy has been “bought” by big campaign donors and that “this is not a democracy anymore.” He also reiterated his one-policy plan: to pass a referendum aimed at reforming campaign finance and then immediately give up his presidential powers to his vice president.
Lessig first said he would run for president on Sunday, after he exceeded his goal of raising $1 million in crowdfunded donations to kick-start his campaign. In an interview after the event, Lessig said he and his campaign staff “pulled together” the launch event in about four or five days, since they were not sure they would meet the goal by their deadline of Labor Day.
“I think nobody was willing to say we had done it until we did it,” Lessig said.
As of Wednesday night, Lessig had received more than $1.064 million in donations.
Now, Lessig said, he is focused on fulfilling the requirements to participate in upcoming Democratic Party debates. To participate, he will need to gain at least 1 percent of support in three or more credible national polls.
Flanked by his wife and three children at the lectern, Lessig emphasized the symbolic importance of the location, which today houses a senior center. In 1995, then-President Bill Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich met at that very spot to create a commission mandated with studying the limits of federal lobbying and financing campaigns.
New Hampshire was also a symbolic location for Lessig because he has held numerous walks across the state—called the New Hampshire Rebellion—about campaign finance reform, said his wife, Bettina Neuefeind, a fellow at Harvard Law School.
Supporters came from around New Hampshire and beyond to hear Lessig speak. Doug Hall, a supporter from California who vacations in New Hampshire over the summer, said the timing of Lessig’s last-minute campaign launch was perfect, because he will Hall leave for California on Thursday.
“I am convinced that this is the number one issue,” said Hall, who heard of Lessig through his New Hampshire Rebellion walks. “Why not think big?”
According to Jeff McLean, a Lessig campaign organizer, the campaign has a fairly small staff, spread across San Francisco and Austin, Texas, among other locations.
Lessig is on leave from the Law School this semester and is not teaching classes. He said he is uncertain when he will return to the school, depending on whether or not he receives the Democratic nomination. Harvard rules forbid professors from taking leaves of absence for more than two consecutive years.

In addition to predictable changes that come with every new school year—new classes, perhaps a new place to live—Harvard Law School students are also adjusting to a major policy change that rolled out over the summer: the new process their school is using to investigate and hear sexual harassment cases.
The procedures, which differ significantly from the approach in place at other Harvard schools, are the product of months of debate among faculty members who pushed for the Law School to adopt the unique model after they raised concerns about Harvard’s protection of the due process rights of the accused. Under the Law School’s new system, an adjudicatory panel of non-Harvard affiliated professionals will rule on violations of Harvard’s University-wide sexual harassment policy, potentially after a hearing. The Law School will provide students involved in a case with an attorney if requested.
Now, with the new process in place, Law School administrators are beginning to educate their students on the intricate and sometimes complex new process. So far, students—the body directly affected by the change—seem mostly unaware of what it entails.

Last semester, before the new process had been fully implemented, Law students interviewed largely said they were not familiar with the specific changes to the school’s procedures.
“At this point, I guess, the procedures themselves were mostly the brainchild of the faculty,” Robert K. Fountain, a Law School student and organizer for student group Harvard Talks Title IX, said last semester.
Months later, students are similarly unsure of the new process’s implications. Administrators finalized the new procedures over the summer, and on Aug. 28, they emailed the full Law School student body informing them of the change. An email, though, may not have been enough to communicate it to everyone, as several students interviewed said they are still not familiar with the procedures that now apply to them.
“This was before school started, so I wasn’t really checking email,” said Faye E. Maison, a third-year Law student.
Leland S. Shelton, also a third-year Law student, said that he does not know many specifics about the new procedures, but he is hopeful that they will help address the problem of campus sexual assault.
“I still haven’t really formed an opinion on those rules. What I do hope is that the new sexual assault policy will curb the sexual assaults that happen on Harvard’s campus, including the Law School’s,” he said.
Law School administrators plan to hold an information session about the new procedures on Sept. 24.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Saturday brunch is officially off the menu, but Harvard University Dining Services rolled out a rotating sandwich bar and a more cohesive daily menu to campus dining halls in an effort to diversify its meal offerings.
The menu changes include a wider selection of fruit to serve as yogurt toppings at breakfast, a daily rotating sandwich bar in place of the former fixed deli, and a chili bar to replace the usual pasta bar during lunch.
According to spokesperson Crista Martin, HUDS introduced the rotating sandwich bar to make the lunch deli “more fun and interesting,” and it will likely change over time or seasonally.
The introduction of a permanent lunchtime chili bar that includes meat and vegetarian options, meanwhile, is an attempt to make the lunch menu healthier and lighter, Martin said. It also expands dining hall vegetarian options and accommodates students with gluten allergies.
Students, for their part, seem to welcome the new offerings.
“For me, if I were to come in and only have breaded chicken or pasta to choose from, I can’t really eat that,” Laura E. Clerx ’16 said. “I really like the new options.”
HUDS also made the switch to hot breakfast and lunch on Saturdays instead of the brunch menu it had reintroduced last year.
Speaking of the change, Martin said last fall’s switch to Saturday brunch was “sort of a trial.”
“People were asking for it, but once we enacted it [students] really didn’t like it," she said.
“Wwe probably won't feel too much of a difference,” Chloe Y. Li ’16 said. “It was nice to have brunch on both weekend days, though.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

UPDATED: September 9, 2015, at 11:14 p.m.
In what appears to be a new campaign, a series of posters about sexual assault at the College cropped up in Sever Hall on Wednesday.
Emblazoned with the matching tagline “#justharvardthings,” one poster depicts a smiling woman with the words “when you smile shyly in the dhall at the man who sexually assaulted you” in the caption.
Another poster, captioned “when no one picks up the 24 hour sexual assault hotline. twice.” seemed to reference Harvard’s sexual harassment response resources.
It was not immediately clear who was behind the posters. But Alicia Oeser, the director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, responded with a statement that trained OSAPR staff answer the confidential hotline 24 hours each day.
“In the rare case that a call is missed, most likely because we are on the other line,” she wrote in an email, OSAPR encourages individuals to leave a message that staff will delete after they hear it. Oeser added that OSAPR is “always looking for ways to be more accessible and available.”
The posters’ presence comes at a time of heightened awareness and scrutiny surrounding how sexual assault is handled at Harvard.
The College is currently under federal investigation for allegedly violating anti-sex discrimination law Title IX, after two undergraduates filed a complaint with the government in April 2014. More recently, student activists have continued to criticize aspects of the University's Title IX policy and procedures, as well as its ability to investigate assault allegations.
Last academic year, Harvard implemented a new centralized Title IX policy, which created a University-wide office tasked with investigating cases, among other points. For months, undergraduate activists publicly decried the fact that some staff positions in the office for a time remained vacant and otherwise argued that there was a lack of institutional support for the office.
Investigators from the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights also visited the College this past spring to solicit student input on the policies and culture at the school.
Harvard has responded to the scrutiny in several ways. In addition to rolling out a new sexual assault policy, it participated in a survey on campus sexual conduct climate last spring, the results of which are expected to be released later this month. Administrators have also raised concerns about sexual assault in final clubs.

The Cambridge Police Department is cautioning women in and around Harvard Square about the recent increase in reports of indecent assault and battery in the area.
According to a bulletin issued on Wednesday, five separate incidents of assault and battery had been reported in the vicinity of Harvard Square in a two-week period.
The most recent of these incidents reportedly occurred at approximately 8:30 p.m. Tuesday night, at the intersection of Garden Street and Massachusetts Avenue. The bulletin described the perpetrator as a “black male in his mid-20s, approximately 5’ 10” with a stocky build, short hair and a white t-shirt.”
This incident was only the latest in a recent string of similar assault and batteries. Other assaults were reported on Garden Street, in Brattle Square, and on Mass. Ave. Though the suspects in these incidents were also described as black men with stocky builds between 5’ 8” and 5’ 10”, it is not clear if the cases are related in any way, the bulletin noted. In one incident, an arrest was made.
Though it is unclear whether the victims of these alleged crimes have any affiliation with Harvard, the proximity of the incidents to the University has prompted a joint effort between CPD and Harvard Police.
“Cambridge Police are actively working with the Harvard University Police Department to investigate these incidents and have directed patrols in the Harvard Square area,” the bulletin said.
In an email alert Wednesday, HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano urged Harvard affiliates to take “appropriate precautions" by walking in groups and using shuttle services.

As they begin the final semester of their terms, Undergraduate Council President Ava Nasrollahzadeh ’16 and UC Vice President Dhruv P. Goyal ’16 say they do not plan to focus their efforts on creating new initiatives. Instead, they say they want to make their past ones last beyond their tenure. 
In an interview Tuesday, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal pointed to two Council initiatives last spring—"Side by Side," a gender equity campaign, and Ventfull, a calendar smartphone application that the Council paid to bring to Harvard last spring—they want to establish as fixtures for the College’s future.
“Ensuring that they go on beyond [our administration] will be the focus of this semester,” Goyal said.
Goyal said he believes that the Council had already pushed through many initiatives last semester in addition to "Side by Side" and Ventfull, citing the establishment of a pilot spring break dining plan and a pilot program that combined Harvard University IDs and Charlie Cards.
“Launching more stuff [this semester] will actually be detrimental,” he added.
Specifically, Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said they plan to approach student groups that submitted a gender equity pledge and see that they follow through on those pledges.
For the Ventfull smartphone application, which incorporates student group events on one platform, the UC leaders said they are considering introducing different filters to sort events. They said filters for health and wellness and “special events” such as freshman orientation and the Harvard-Yale football game are potentially on the horizon.
For his part, UC Rules Committee Chair Brett M. Biebelberg ’16 said there are other steps that need to be taken before the UC attempts to make Ventfull and "Side by Side" permanent fixtures of life at the College. Specifically, he said, the Council needs to determine usage of Ventfull. While more than 2,000 undergraduates have downloaded it, UC representatives have not said how many undergraduates use the app on a regular basis.
If usage of the app is low, Biebelberg said, the Council ought to reconsider a more effective way to use their money and resources this semester. “If it turns out that they are attracting use, then it might be worth exploring how these things can be continued,” he said.
Nasrollahzadeh and Goyal said they will also focus on an improved campaign and voting process for prospective UC representatives.
“We’re deploying a much more robust recruitment campaign,” Nasrollahzadeh said, adding that this semester, the UC will host a series of information sessions on the election process and encourage students from diverse backgrounds to pursue involvement with the Council.

As the Sept. 30 expiration date for their current contract approaches, members of the Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers and University administrators continue bi-weekly meetings to discuss the historically contentious contract between Harvard and its biggest union. 
“A lot of important and useful groundwork has been laid, but there’s still a great deal of work to be done and not a lot of time to do it in,” said Bill Jaeger, the director of HUCTW. “Leadership on both sides are feeling pressure to intensify.”
Katie N. Lapp, the University’s executive vice president, said in a statement that the summer meetings were characterized by “constructive discussion and information sharing.”
Negotiators have failed to meet the deadline multiple times before in the union’s 27-year history, including the last time the contract was renegotiated in 2013, when talks ran over eight months past the deadline, the longest delay in the union’s history. In the event that an agreement is not reached by the deadline, HUCTW leadership said the union will likely continue to operate on its existing contract, as it has done in the past.
Failure to meet the Sept. 30 deadline, Jaeger said, would also mean that a full year will have passed since HUCTW members received a raise.
“From the union’s point of view, that’s an important threshold,” he said.
In addition to salary, health care is an ongoing point of discussion in the contract negotiations.
“There are important and complicated issues on the table, including changes to health care benefits, where negotiations are impacted by broader university decision-making,” Lapp said in the statement.
In fall 2014, the University announced changes in health care benefits for all non-union employees, prompting backlash among professors. Since then, the University Benefits Committee has gone back to the drawing board and recently presented non-union employees with new point of service plans with higher premiums but no deductibles and coinsurance. The committee also removed coinsurance and deductibles on diagnostic tests for the other options.
Though the recent changes do not apply to HUCTW, health care has also been a key element of union negotiations in recent years. Last spring, members of HUCTW and Harvard administrators held a series of informal meetings with public health and policy experts from the University to familiarize both sides with possible solutions to the health care debate. Those meetings, said Carrie E. Barbash, a HUCTW organizer, have been “incredibly helpful” in negotiations with the University so far.
The importance of changes to health care, including more extensive wellness programming and benefits to HUCTW members, emerged in a survey conducted by union leadership last spring to take the temperature of its membership. More than 60 percent of respondents were “very supportive” of increased wellness programming such as exercise classes. In response, the University has utilized its HUCTW negotiations webpage to emphasize current wellness offerings that are already available to HUCTW members, such as low-cost gym memberships and fitness classes.
Barbash and Jaeger said select details from many areas of the survey have been presented at the negotiation meetings, emphasizing debt, rising costs of living, and increased rents as central issues for many HUCTW employees. According to the survey, which had a 60 percent response rate among HUCTW members, after health care, the rising cost of renting was the largest area of concern for members, 56 percent of whom rent their homes.
In addition, last winter’s severe weather highlighted the desire for the new contract to address language regarding flexibility during extreme weather and transportation problems, with 81 percent of respondents saying that the change is “very important.”
With negotiations set to intensify in the coming weeks as the deadline approaches, Jaeger said negotiators are considering lengthening the duration and increasing the frequency of negotiating sessions.

The School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and the Graduate School of Design will open applications to a new collaborative two-year master’s program in design engineering this fall, according to SEAS spokesperson Paul Karoff.
The program, first reported by The Crimson last spring and called the Master’s of Design Engineering, is intended for professionals who demonstrate technical literacy and have at least two years of work experience in engineering, design, government, or business, according to a press release.
“Students are not required to have experience in engineering or design; they need to show they have the capacity for it,” said K. Michael Hays, co-director of the program and an architectural theory professor at the GSD. “Eventually we may also be accepting some people from backgrounds like business and public health.”
Woodward Yang, the program’s other co-director and a professor at SEAS, said that in its inaugural year, the program will accept 12 to 20 students, and that classes will begin in the fall of 2016.
According to Yang, the new degree will train students to work collaboratively to come up with interdisciplinary solutions to real-life problems. During the program, students will take the equivalent of four courses per semester, including a studio course and a “core” course on topics like entrepreneurship, intellectual property, and leadership. They will also complete a thesis-like design project in their second year.
“It’s important to know how to be creative in the solution of a problem, not creative for being creative’s sake—that’s art,” said Yang, who teaches electrical engineering and computer science. “What we are interested in is being creative in solving real big problems, not ‘How do I make an engine more efficient,’ but more like ‘Why do we have engines in the first place.’”
According to Hays, conversations about the introduction of a collaborative master’s program began three years ago. The process of getting through the various administrative hurdles, though long and arduous, was constructive to the refinement of the degree’s proposal, he said. Following a vote by the faculty of both schools, the Harvard Corporation approved the program this summer.
Each school has agreed to hire new faculty to support the program, Hays added.
The new degree will join only two other existing terminal master’s programs at SEAS, one in Computational Science and Engineering, which focuses on data science and was introduced in 2013, and one in Electrical Engineering, which according to the school’s website offers admission only in “exceptional circumstances.”
The dearth of master’s programs at SEAS is not due to lack of enthusiasm or funding but of space, Yang said.
“I’m sure that by moving to Allston, the new space will allow us to have more opportunities,” he added, referring to the relocation of the majority of the school’s teaching areas across the Charles River that is slated for 2019.
Hays said he hopes that the whole MDE program will eventually be taught at the Allston campus, where more innovative learning spaces will likely be created.
Currently, the GSD offers joint degrees with the Kennedy School and the Law School, and a joint program with the School of Public Health is being discussed, according to Hays.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Leaders of a group of Harvard graduate students seeking to unionize made a pitch for new members at the first Graduate Student Council meeting of the school year on Wednesday evening.
This pitch comes after Jeff Neal, a University spokesperson, wrote in an email Tuesday that University President Drew G. Faust stands by her opposition of the union, a stance that she first discussed with The Crimson in May, not long after a group of graduate made public their movement to unionize.
Christina V. Groeger ’08, a graduate student in the History Department, and William E. Baldwin, a graduate student in the English Department, told the packed room that Faust’s stance will not slow their efforts to organize.
Faust's statement, Baldwin said, "is not a surprise."
"I don’t think that changes anything, actually,” Baldwin said, adding that “as nice as it would have been," the group had "no illusion" that Faust would come out in support of the movement.
John Gee, a graduate student in the History Department, said the ultimate goal for organizing the union is to gather a large enough base of support to potentially force the University to engage in a conversation.
“The next step is just growing membership, because the University doesn’t want to recognize the union in principle, which Drew Faust said she didn’t want to do,” he said. “Then the step is to get membership and say, you know, a majority of graduate students support a union and the University needs to recognize that.”
As the vice president of the Graduate Student Council, Gee said he is committed to keeping other graduate students informed about the unionization effort.
“We want to make sure we have that conversation and graduate students know what is going on,” he said.
Groeger and Baldwin also spoke at the meeting about some of the substantive benefits they argued a union could achieve if recognized by Harvard.
“People want dental insurance. That is a common thing that they do not offer grad students. They want healthcare, childcare, parental leave, a grievance procedure so you can’t just get fired from your lab,” Groeger said.
Groeger also pointed to what has historically been a sore spot specifically among the graduate students at Harvard: insecurity surrounding shopping week and sectioning.
“The craziness of shopping period does not exist at other universities that have unions. If you expect to teach a course, you are going to teach that course in the fall or they will pay you money,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard Allston Task Force met on Wednesday for the first time since last spring to discuss the implementation of the University’s $43 million community benefits package and the results of a Harvard-funded study on possible connections between North Allston and the Charles River.
The meeting marked the start of what Boston Redevelopment Authority senior project manager Gerald Autler described as an “intensive” task force meeting schedule, with four more meetings in September and October, compared to just once a month earlier last spring.
“You might ask ‘why so many meetings?’,” Autler said. “There are a couple of development projects that Harvard wants to move forward with … The BRA and Harvard wanted to give people ample opportunity to react.”
Updates on Harvard’s development provided by BRA and University representatives included refurbishing neighborhood sidewalks and planting trees on Everett Street, allocating funds through Harvard’s Housing Initiative, and reporting on the status of the flexible fund included in the University’s community benefits package for Allston.
While the University has allocated $5.35 million to that fund, intended for a variety of neighborhood improvements, the membership of the advisory board that will manage the fund has yet to be announced.
“You’re going to be part of the decision-making process on how those funds get allocated,” said Kevin Casey, Harvard’s associate vice president for public affairs and communications. “That will be decided by an advisory board that is being appointed by the BRA.” 
The majority of the meeting was spent discussing the results of a $150,000 feasibility study evaluating possible locations for crossings along Soldiers Field Road that will improve access to the Charles. Out of four locations studied, the Everett Street intersection and the pedestrian bridge at Telford Street were the best candidates for improvement, according to Harvard senior manager for transportation Joseph G. Beggan, who presented the results.
A July report from the BRA said that an at-grade crossing would be “feasible with signal modification and other intersection improvements” at the Everett Street intersection, and that the Telford Street pedestrian bridge could be made Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant, perhaps as part of a larger renovation effort. Beggan said the $3.35 million budget allocated for the crossings as part of Harvard’s community benefits package could cover both projects, including design and construction costs.
Task force members expressed enthusiasm for the projects and interest in moving it ahead on an accelerated timeline, perhaps even aiming for a construction date early next year.
Autler, for his part, thought the community should take more time at future meetings to consider the broader context of the construction project and discuss where funds might come from to cover any additional costs.
“This is not just about getting people in the neighborhood to the river,” Autler said. “It’s about getting all the people who go to the river … into the neighborhood to get sandwiches and ice cream and whatever else they’re craving from neighborhood businesses.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 10, 2015, at 3:23 p.m.
After seeing its nine-game home winning streak snapped over the weekend, the Harvard men’s soccer team (0-1-1) will look to right the ship in its final home tilt of the month against Connecticut (0-0-3) on Thursday.
The Crimson will be seeking its first victory of 2015 at a familiar venue bearing an unfamiliar name. The Athletic Department announced Wednesday that Soldiers Field, the team's primary home field, has been renamed to Jordan Field in honor of Jerry Jordan '61, a former end for the Harvard football team.
Thursday's tilt was moved to Jordan Field just a few hours prior to kickoff. The game was originally scheduled to be played on the natural grass surface of Ohiri Field, where the team practices during the preseason but has played just five games over the last three seasons—including one against the Huskies in 2012.
In that contest, an NCAA Tournament-bound UConn squad brought what former Harvard coach Carl Junot called “the perfect storm,” as the Huskies held the Crimson without a single shot on goal in a 6-0 rout.
But three years removed from the blowout at Ohiri, Harvard has transformed from a team that had to scrap for its three wins in 2012 to a legitimate conference contender.
“All us seniors, even the guys who came here after us, we all know what happened, and we still remember back to that day,” senior forward Jake Freeman said. “But I think we’re all aware how much the program has turned around, and now we feel like we’re in a position to be right there with them…. We feel like we can really bring it to them.”
Nonetheless, the Crimson will have its work cut out against a UConn defense that has thus far been flawless. Dating back to last year, the Huskies have gone 797 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal—part of a 10-game unbeaten streak.
But despite three consecutive clean sheets for redshirt sophomore Scott Levene, the rest of the UConn squad has not yet been able to provide their netminder with any offensive support. The Huskies have mustered just 13 shots on goal through three games and have yet to find the back of the net.
UConn’s offensive struggles bode well for Harvard, but if the Crimson is going to become the fourth team in a row to shut out the Huskies, the team will likely have to do it without its top defender.
Center back and returning co-captain Mark Ashby sat out Harvard’s first two games with what he described to The Crimson on Wednesday as a quadriceps strain. Ashby says his status is “day-to-day,” but he does not expect to play against UConn.
“It’s tough, but this happens to every player, so I’m just doing my rehab [and] getting great treatment from the training staff,” Ashby said. “I can’t really be sure when I’ll be back, but I’m definitely working my hardest to get back on the field.”
With Ashby watching from the sideline, Harvard failed to come away with a victory on the season’s opening weekend.
Thanks to a 73rd minute strike from sophomore forward Alvaro Madrigal, Loyola Marymount (4-0-0), now ranked No. 20 in the nation, squeaked by with a 1-0 win over the Crimson on Friday. Then on Sunday, Harvard played to a 2-2 draw with then-No. 23 Southern Methodist (2-1-1).
Among those stepping up in the absence of Ashby were senior Andrew Chang and junior Alex Leondis, who started both games on the back line and also helped aid the offensive attack on Sunday with seven combined shots.
“It’s always a challenge when the captain goes down, but we’re a team that’s blessed with so much depth, especially back there on the back line,” Freeman said. “It’s kind of a ‘next man up’ policy. We know that no matter what happens...the next player up will step up and fill the role as best as they can and with as much effort as possible.”
The Crimson attack, which Chang and Leondis helped kick into gear on Sunday, came to life after struggling to find its rhythm on Friday, when LMU keeper Paul Blanchette only had to make four saves. Against SMU, Freeman and senior forward Oliver White each got on the scoresheet. As a result of the adjustment, Freeman feels good about the team’s chances moving forward.
“We didn’t think we had our best performance on Friday, so we tweaked some things over the weekend,” Freeman said. “Coming into Sunday, we think we really put up our best performance. Unfortunately, we didn’t get the outcome we want, but we feel like we’re moving in the right direction.”

This Friday, a new-look Harvard men’s and women’s cross country team will hit the ground running in Franklin Park at the Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet, the squad’s first of the 2015 season.
“The team has a much different feel to it compared to last year,” men’s captain Thomas Purnell said. “We’ve got a better attitude than we did last season. We weren’t really fully committed last year and just thought it would come to us. There’s a lot more focus in this group, a lot more intensity.”
Purnell was the Crimson’s lone runner to compete at the NCAA National Championships last year, after finishing 17th at NCAA Regionals. The Gloucestershire, U.K., native was also Harvard’s top runner at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships, where he finished eighth.
Fellow captain Chris Allen will help lead the team alongside Purnell on the men’s side. Allen was the third Crimson runner to cross the finish line at last year’s Ivy League Heptagonal Championships and NCAA Regionals.
Sophomore Ben Huffman will help anchor a men’s team with only four seniors and 17 underclassmen. The Waxhaw, N.C., native was the youngest Harvard runner on the men’s side to run in the Ivy League Heps last season, where he finished behind Purnell with the second-best time of any Harvard competitor.
The Harvard men will be looking to avenge a third place finish at last year’s Harvard-Yale-Princeton meet when they face off against conference rivals Yale and Princeton on Friday.
“It’s great to be on our home course,” men’s coach Jason Saretsky said. “We’re working hard and putting in the miles to develop our aerobic capacity to set us up for a great meet.”
On the women’s side, second year coach Patrick Wales-Dinan hopes to build on the progress made last season, which he called a “year filled with transition.”
“We’re encouraged with where we are coming out of preseason and summer training,” Wales-Dinan said. “We just weren’t very good last year. We weren’t all on the same page. This is going to be the foundation year for what’s going to be exceptional success for the next five to 10 years.”
Captain Paige Kouba was the only non-senior to run in last season’s NCAA Regionals, where she finished fourth among Harvard runners and 82nd overall. The Eugene, Ore. native was the Crimson’s top finisher at the Ivy League Heps, where she finished 19th overall and helped lead the squad to a fifth place finish.
“We’re ready to do something a lot bigger than last year,” women’s captain Paige Kouba said. “Last year was a transition year. This time, we’re a little more experienced, a little more ready, and a lot more fit than we were before.”
Joining Kouba in leading the women’s team are junior Sarah Gillespie and sophomore Courtney Smith. Gillespie posted a 21st place finish at last season’s Ivy League Heps, finishing just a little over one second behind Kouba. Smith wasted no time breaking onto the scene last year, as she was the first Crimson runner to cross the finish line at the season-opening competition, the H-Y-P meet.
Freshman Erin Dietz rounds out a youthful bunch on the women’s side. Dietz was a Footlocker National Cross Country Finalist in 2014 and was twice a Massachusetts state champion in track and cross country before arriving at Harvard.
The Bedford, Mass. native, who finished third at U.S. Junior Nationals in the 5k race, leads a group of six freshmen on the women’s side.
“Harvard should be a name that is synonymous with excellence in everything that it does, and it should be that way with cross country,” Saretsky said. “We’ve established that on the track side, and I’m excited for the men’s distance group to take that on, and I’m confident that the women are in a great position to have a competitive season.”

Happy Thursday, Harvard! Is it still shopping week? Are study cards due? When do sections start? Do we finally need to do our readings? The questions never end, but study cards are due today before midnight, so get those advising holds lifted and enroll in your classes! And if you’ve been using shopping week as an excuse for not having done your work, be glad you’re not in a language class that already has quizzes on top of homework.
