After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In director Paul Thomas Anderson’s collected works, if there were ever a film that deserved to be called “Punch Drunk Love,” it’s “The Master.” Much of the film follows Joaquin Phoenix’s character, Freddie Quell, as he moves from job to job—and job to cult—creatively mixing drinks out of whatever is available to him. In the opening sequence, he drinks the ethanol from a bombshell, mixed with some form of desert island fruit. Later, he incorporates dark room chemicals into his concoction. The drinking serves a thematic purpose—the film is fundamentally about intoxication and the ways people mask what Anderson thinks of as life’s fundamental meaninglessness. But it works on another level too, for this is film making of such high quality that it’s impossible not to get drunk on its strength.
This is a Serious Film—not a movie. This is a film that didn’t win Best Picture at the Venice Film Festival because it had already won the maximum number of top awards allowed by the festival’s rules. If personal experience is any indicator, the line outside theaters showing this movie will be a prime spot for “Annie Hall” re-enactors to talk loudly about the film and Anderson’s early works. In short, it has been praised. And certainly it deserves the accolades even on purely technical grounds. Philip Seymour Hoffman’s performance as Lancaster Dodd, a cult leader in the vein of L. Ron Hubbard, is so captivating that it’s fittingly hard to maintain a critical perspective on his drunken illusions.
Like Dirk Diggler, an early Anderson creation, Dodd is a study in animal magnetism, only his equivalent of Mark Wahlberg’s large prosthetic member is an understanding smile and some of the best oratorical tone this side of the President. When Hoffman’s skill is matched with Joaquin Phoenix’s unnerving performance of man as pure beast, it becomes easy to trade a slower moving plot for hours of talking, thrashing, and drinking. In an early scene, a drunk Dodd calls Freddie in for some “informal processing”—a method by which members of the Cause are able to time travel to cure their souls of ailments accrued in past lives. Dodd is—theoretically—interested in transcendence and time travel; Freddie is interested in the two minutes on either side of the present. For the duration of the scene, Dodd grills Freddie about his transgressions, and it’s like watching an unstoppable force meet an immovable object. The scene is pure electric tension.
Behind many such brilliant moments is Jonny Greenwood’s uneasy score. The main theme sounds like a broken clock. A sinister string bass line provides an interminable rhythm that Greenwood heckles with off-beat percussion. This is the sound of Freddie’s addled mind. When he first reconciles with Dodd, the music resolves, but quickly sours with dissonance. As with the film’s alcohol and religion, every moment of clarity and happiness is ephemeral. Even such a fine Master can’t sustain the resolutions.
The instability of Freddie’s ideals provide the central tension of the film. In the opening sequence, his division of the Navy is stranded on an island. As Freddie drinks, some of the men sculpt a gigantic woman in the sand. At the end of the sequence, Freddie lies down beside her and closes his eyes. This image recurs at two other points, and is core to the film’s meaning. When Dodd processes Freddie, Freddie recalls the girl he wanted to marry. As he remembers her, we see her tower above him—gigantic like the sand woman. Dodd, too, is larger than life—a doctor, a nuclear physicist, a theoretical philosopher—and it is this ideal that Freddie clings to because, as Dodd’s wife Peggy (Amy Adams) says, he “can’t take this life straight.” He spends the film blindly willing his ideals into reality, but like the dissonance in a half-resolved chord, he never can merge the two. In a later scene, he paces back and forth between a wall and a window under Dodd’s order, attempting to feel a spirit behind each. In this scene and throughout the film, he wears shirts buttoned to the neck and suits that clutch his hunched Homo erectus body like a strait jacket. Ultimately, the Cause’s meaning is as ill-fitting, and he is unable to feel anything more than the wearing wood of the wall.
In the bleak world of this film, there is no more legitimate belief than the Cause—only people who serve one another’s ideologies in order to bring meaning to their lives.Though brilliant, its tone is slightly monochromatic, its incessant sickliness coming to seem almost unimaginative at times. Yet still the potion is strong, and its depiction of life on Earth hits like a shot of paint thinner: for every man, a master and a thousand grains of disordered sand.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Usually, the sound of bullets hitting their target is only followed by a fist-bump if the bullets were fired by a video game controller and if the player is not alone in their basement. Not so in the opening of David Ayer’s “End of Watch,” as LAPD officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) quickly gun down two men after a lengthy car chase shown from their point of view.
“End of Watch” follows Taylor and Zavala’s increasingly dire straits as they unknowingly disrupt a drug cartel’s operations in southern Los Angeles and are targeted by heavily-armed pushers. The compelling, occasionally nerve-wracking plot and simple, effective staging combine to create a gripping story of two policemen being continually beaten to the ground—both physically and mentally—and a moving depiction of friendship by Gyllenhaal and Peña.
Initially, neither Taylor nor Zavala are very likable characters. Respectful policemen, after all, are not expected to pound fists after killing two men, nor are they supposed to display their weapons to the camera the way little girls show off their Barbies. At first, their only apparent redeeming quality is their jovial, sometimes crass, and incredibly dedicated partnership.
However, as the loose camera continues to follow Taylor and Zavala while they respond to emergency calls and investigate various strange noises emanating from suspicious houses, the lightheartedness that seemed insensitive earlier is revealed as a necessary way for the two men to cope with their job. As they encounter increasingly horrific and gruesome crimes—Ayer sparing no detail as knife wounds and dismembered bodies are shown up close—it is clear that if the officers allowed themselves to wallow in uncertainty or guilt, they would be unable to carry out their day-to-day business.
The short glimpses of the emotional aftermath feel genuine and harrowing, thanks to Gyllenhaal and Peña’s unforced, nuanced performances. After making an arrest in a particularly disturbing case, Gyllenhaal can communicate the toll being taken on him in merely the slump of his shoulders and a slight headshake. Zavala reacts differently, staring blankly at a crime scene as if he’s not quite sure if he believes what he’s seeing. Later, after both officers receive medals for their courage, Taylor hesitantly and endearingly asks Zavala, “Do you feel like a hero? What does a hero feel like?”
At times, “End of Watch” inflicts similar distress upon its audience: the pacing of the film can pack so much intensity and violence into certain segments that the overwhelming tension takes away from the story itself. Some confusion and inconsistency is apparent as the found-footage styling, justified by a film project Taylor is working on for pre-law courses, is occasionally switched out for typical third-person camerawork and footage mysteriously attained from the cartel’s members.
Gyllenhaal and Peña’s easy, bantering depiction of a profound relationship quickly compensates for the erratic camerawork, as Taylor begins dating Janet (a sweet but forgettable Anna Kendrick) and Zavala celebrates the birth of a son. The two discuss all of this, both seriously and jokingly, in the front of their police cruiser, which begins to seem like the only place where they both can truly relax.
Quite a bit of the film is committed to Taylor and Zavala’s banter within the car, so the staging of “End of Watch” is not always very dynamic. But when there is a change of setting, it is usually made striking through simple details: a fluttering plastic sheet over a door in a suspicious house, smoke wafting slowly out of a suspect’s mouth during a confrontation, or the unsettling sight of uniformed policemen sprinting down an alleyway, screaming for help.
In the end, though, the film relies on its actors as much as the characters they play rely on each other. Ayer, perhaps aware of this, concludes “End of Watch” not with a deep reflection on the bloody and trying events that transpired or with a dramatic monologue to match Taylor’s opening voice-over, but on an everyday conversation between Taylor and Zavala—a tribute to the strength required not to fire a gun but go back to work the next day, and to the devoted bond that makes it bearable to do so.

It’s hard to imagine that Mumford & Sons have experienced as many existential crises in the past couple years as claims their new album, “Babel.” From all reports, it seems they’re pretty overjoyed with their new lives as international rock stars. Yet on every song, Mumford & Sons are down on their knees hoping for redemption and seemingly salvaged by each and every banjo climax. It’s suspicious.
Mumford & Sons are very good at what they do; that’s part of the problem. Songs like the lead single “I Will Wait” easily demonstrate why they’re one of the most popular bands around today. The lyrics are built of big, amorphous statements about a big, amorphous relationship, and are vague enough so that eager listeners can project their own stories onto them. The instrumental is driven by a foot-stomping bass drum, a gleeful banjo, and a pulsing acoustic guitar. And Marcus Mumford roars an incredibly catchy melody over it all. It’s a strong formula, but ultimately it is nothing more than a formula, and a slightly sinister one at that. It crafts the illusion of genuine emotion and personal catharsis out of recycled signifiers of the soul with lyrics like ”So I’ll be bold / As well as strong / And use my head alongside my heart.” For a band with such a gift for big-hearted melodies, this lyrical emptiness is a sin.
Mumford & Sons has a name that could just as easily be a clothing store. Fittingly, their music is tailored to the past few years’ vogue for sexless indie folk rock. They’re like the Old Navy version of last fall’s best style, a safe choice for people who like pop music but want something a little different, and they comfortably serve up the big themes of love, faith, and doubt in healthy helpings of inanity. They’re ideologically and aesthetically committed to old things: identical banjo climaxes characterize nearly every song and are frequently heralded by bluegrass-for-the-masses harmonies. Songs like “Babel” are meant to sound like barn-burners from the good old days well before albums leaked on the Internet. And every song is based on the same lyrical and instrumental patterns such that it becomes nearly impossible to differentiate the songs. But there’s a significant difference between the music Mumford & Sons is trying to sound like and the music they produce.
Although the biblical Tower of Babel was driven by collaboration through universal language, “Babel” is ironically plagued by a bare minimum of concern for the words that drive its morals and values. Mumford knows all the lyrical tricks that signify earnestness and traditional folk values, and this is most evident in his nearly constant use of two tropes. He is always talking about his lover’s eyes, and he is on his knees or has fallen to the ground on almost every song on the album. “Not Without Haste,” for instance, is all about how his lover’s eyes “tie [him] down so hard,” but that she still took him up even when he was “on [his] knees” and broke. These lyrics suggest genuine emotion, but Mumford’s easy substitution of generic lines like “we will be who we are…sadness will be far away” for harder hitting, personal material is a sham.
This shortcoming is clearest on the penultimate track of the album. To their credit, it is pretty courageous to record and release a cover of Simon & Garfunkel’s classic,“The Boxer.” In the context of Mumford & Sons’ ambition, though, it reads less like a tribute, and a bit more like “Now, I’m not saying we’re our generation’s Simon & Garfunkel, but we do also have an ampersand in our name….” What’s most frightening about this song is that they took an old song and made it sound older. Gone are the big horns, didgeridoo harmonicas, and epic drum hits of the Simon & Garfunkel version. In their place are simple harmonies, pretty piano lines, banjo, and a dobro. This isn’t a step forward or even an homage: it’s a step backwards into an ideal that’s only ever existed in commercials for Levi’s.
This is an album of pretty music, and it can be fun music, too. But considering that the band members so clearly have the ears for huge, catchy melodies—and so many people listening—such a fearful retreat from more considered, varied songwriting is a sorely missed opportunity.

From September19 to the 21st, the New England Conservatory and Northeastern University partnered to create a symposium and tribute to legendary composer Harry Partch for students in the Boston area. Many consider Partch to be the father of microtonal music, which features notes not normally seen in the 12-note musical scale. Partch’s symposium celebrated not only his innovative style, but his ability to inspire other musicians to test the bounds of musical possibility.
Harry Partch was one of the first 20th-century composers to work substantially in the field of microtonal music. His passion for music led him to create an entire orchestra of his own instruments in the ‘40s and ‘50s, some of which included augmented forms of common instruments like the guitar and the viola. His determination to question the boundaries of the music scale itself led him to become an innovative composer and creator of musical devices. “Like most other people that are learning western music, I thought there were 12 tones in the octave, and Harry Partch had broken through that using far more tones per octave than 12,” said Dean Drummond, Director of the Harry Partch Institute and Associate Professor of Music at Montclair State University.
The tribute served as a learning experience for those less familiar with Partch and his music and allowed Partch fans all over the Boston area to revel in a rare and rewarding experience. “I think that this is more of a local influence. The instruments have never been here, so a lot of people that are here have never heard the music live,” says Drummond. Viewing a substantial collection of Partch’s instruments together at the concert series was a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most attendees, as amassing the amount of resources that is required to transport the large and rare items is extremely difficult.
For both fans and those new to the microtonal world altogether, the concert series was the landmark feature of the symposium. On Wednesday night, attendees were treated to a show that incorporated both modern compositions inspired by Partch and original Partch compositions themselves, performed by musician John Schneider. During the performance, Schneider played on one of the Partch instruments—the adapted guitar.  While it had the same amount of strings as a classic guitar, it was tuned in thirds instead of fourths, so the six strings (equally spaced on a normal guitar) were divided up into three pairs of two.
The concert itself may have been different or even mystifying to those new to Partch.  “I had heard of microtonal music but had actually never seen it performed,” said Savanna M. Arral ’16, a Harvard freshman who attended the concert. “I thought it was extremely interesting. I think that’s honestly the only way that you can really look at that kind of experimental music: [it] is interesting at first, and [then] it becomes more beautiful the more that you listen to it.”
Those who are more familiar with Partch may be better able to communicate why the music eventually draws all different kinds of people in.  “He had the kind of vision of total artwork. Music and dance and drama and everything embodied on the stage.  And people love his instruments—there is a whimsical side that people really respond to, there is the impressive nature of someone who built their own orchestra over a decade,” said Jonathan Wild, Assistant Professor at the Department of Music Research at Schulich School of Music and board member on the comittee that planned the week-long tribute.
Partch and his unique music have certainly made an impact not only here in Boston this past week, but have also inspired many musicians to think outside of the box and follow in his footsteps, as evidenced by the many Partch-inspired compositions that were played all week.  “He was really born at the wrong time,” says Wild.  “He was born either too late...or too early, because it is much more accepted now to [push the bounds of music].”
Harry Partch’s ability to open new possibilities in the field of music has inspired musicians for decades.  Northeastern University and the New England Conservatory brought the world of Partch to the Boston community, hopefully spreading knowledge about his story, his instruments, and his music to other musicians who may want to someday follow in his footsteps.

If anything can go wrong, it will. This statement, commonly referred to as Murphy’s Law, is the underlying foundation beneath the novel “May We Be Forgiven.” In her latest novel, A.M. Homes takes a modern suburban household to hell and back over the course of one year. They turn from a stereotypical nuclear American family to a patched-up conglomerate of a single father, three adolescent children, two senior citizens, and the owners of a local Chinese restaurant. In this forcefully sardonic and deeply touching novel, Homes proves the power of familial ties and asserts that people can find love even in the most absurd situations.
The novel jumps straight into action through the narration of Harold Silver, a middle-aged university professor with an obsession for Richard Nixon and a blasé attitude toward life. When Harold begins to have an affair with his sister-in-law Jane, the fallout is maddening and chaotic. Harold finds himself divorced and given guardianship over his niece, his nephew, and an orphan named Ricardo. The novel chronicles Harold’s struggle to play a responsible role; he soon gets in over his head, however, with issues ranging from criminal lawsuits to casual forays into online sex.
Due to the oft-comical but otherwise frightening situations in which Homes arbitrarily places him, Harold’s trajectory in the novel focuses around avoiding circumstances where he could jeopardize the wellness of his family. Homes paints Harold at first as an apparently thoughtless and dull man, but his character grows to become the ultimate altruist who understands the fundamental importance of his role as the glue that holds the pieces of his fragmented family together.
The solidarity that Harold displays while taking care of his brother’s children is a manifestation of his devotion to them, despite the fact that he never had any obligation to them before the accident. “With the children gone, the tick-tock of the kitchen clock is deafeningly loud,” Harold says. “I walk around the house in circles.”
Without dependents to take care of, Harold is lost within himself. Only through the time he spends with the children and house can he discover emotions that he never though he had, and come to terms with the harrowing consequences of his brother’s actions after the cheating scandal.
“The truth is, despite how stressful it all is—not to mention the uncanny sensation that the minute you start to think it’s all going well something is bound to fall apart—despite it all, I am pleased with how well the children are doing,” Harold reflects while planning his nephew’s bar mitzvah, a loving gesture that echoes Jane’s former devotion to her children. The pressure to remain sane and responsible during a time of extreme volatility is an obstacle that every character in “May We Be Forgiven” must face; this struggle sheds a light on the uncanny ability for people to be rational and caring even in the most intense situations. Homes stresses a heartwarming implication that when things go wrong, a person finds comfort in the ordinary and relies even more on love from those who are closest.
Indeed, “May We Be Forgiven” is so poignant because of its truthfulness—Homes does not hold back and writes with raw realism of the characters’ evaluations of themselves and their understanding that dreams very rarely come true. “Is this what I’ve been waiting for?” asks Harold at one point in the novel. Homes explores his maturing perspective when Harold realizes that his life’s work researching President Nixon will never be published. Instead of  causing him to dramatically spiral downward, he rather amends his life goal to one that is more reachable in his current state.
Harold’s decision to change his goals, needs, and desires for the sake of those he loves is a realistic scenario that signals a step towards his own maturity. Each character in the novel, from Harold’s 11-year old niece Ashley to the elderly abandoned Cyrus, goes through a process of compromise. “Was there ever a time you thought,” Harold wonders in the novel’s epigraph, “I am doing this on purpose, I am fucking up and I don’t know why.” This witty breaking of the fourth wall calls for the reader’s reflection on past actions and helps forge an emotional connection with the novel’s bittersweet scenarios. Despite any seeming randomness or stupidity of an action, Homes asserts that even mistakes may lead to something bigger, such as a more in-depth understanding of oneself and an opportunity for personal growth.
“It is magical, almost fantastical, and what I’d call the good kind of melancholy—as sweet as it is, it’s also sad,” remarks Harold. “Thanksgiving. It has been a year—and a lifetime.” The sheer force of change that can occur to a random family over the course of only a year serves as a necessary reminder that nothing is ever static. A. M. Homes has created a literary masterpiece that weaves together a deep understanding of the human psyche under stress; at the same time, she comments intelligently on the need for thoughtfulness and compassion. “May we be forgiven; it is a prayer, an incantation,” she writes at the end of the novel. In the end, the book’s message shows that only when one finds what they believe in can they grant themselves forgiveness for their sins; and personal forgiveness ultimately may be the only way in life to move forward.

Melody Prochet may be a rising musical talent, but she is not the star of her debut album, “Melody’s Echo Chamber.” Her sound, rather, is dominated by heavy synthesizers that echo throughout the songs and rob her light voice of its potential. The project’s name is quite fitting, as each of Prochet’s songs is characterized by extreme reverb and soaring, airy vocals blended with 60s rock and enchanting jazz undertones. However, the album is noticeably devoid of catchy hooks or meaningful song development and leaves little tangible memory of what exactly occurred in the musically-induced state of semi-sleep.
Prochet grew up in the French countryside in a musically talented family, and after a last-minute decision to drop her studies of classical singing, she found herself fronting the indie-pop band My Bee’s Garden. From there, she met Tame Impala’s frontman, who invited her band on tour and introduced her to the spacy, synthetic dream-pop sound that has become the foundation of her solo venture and new album.
Having recently moved into Paris, the City of Light, Prochet is perfectly situated to draw upon her cultural heritage with a unique twist, which is particularly evident in “Quand Vas Tu Rentrer,” the seventh track. The rhythmic accordion that propels the track might sound at home in a Parisian cafe, if it weren’t heavily synthesized to match her ambient vocals.
However, Prochet fails to build on the tradition of the French chansons that rely so heavily on lyrical meaning, a shortcoming that deprives each song of further depth. In many of her songs, her lyrics are barely differentiable and she seems to use vocals more to complement and emphasize the instruments. In this way, her style resembles Metric’s “Hustle Rose,” in which the lyrics loop endlessly while the synthesizer’s rhythmic variations drive the song. “Endless Shore” follows this technique, as her voice rises and falls with the eternal tide the title references, but the words still rest somewhere in the hazy mists beyond the breaking waves that keep pushing us back from further comprehension.
The songwriting may not be superb, but each song on the album uses different instrumentation and musical style, giving flavor and variation to her consistently dreamy voice. “Crystallized” draws on a more aggressive U2-ish mix of guitar and drums, while “Mount Hopeless” jumps with a distinct hip-hop beat. The instrumental arrangements, largely overseen by Tame Impala’s frontman Kevin Parker, are the true force in “Melody’s Echo Chamber,” while Prochet herself is just along for the ride. Nowhere is this more apparent than on “Is That What You Said,” which is a trippy tumble through the rabbit hole into dubstep Wonderland; its chaotic sound ends abruptly and clashes with the psychedelic synth-pop flair that characterizes the album as a whole.
After a mostly pleasant if unmemorable ride through “Melody’s Echo Chamber,” the album lands with a solid and unfortunate thump into her final song, “Be Proud of your Kids.” After the climactic ending of “Snowcapped Andes Crash” (which literally ends with a bang), “Be Proud of your Kids” seems out of place. The song features a young child babbling in French who clashes uncomfortably with the falsely cheery synthesizer and muddled vocal harmonies. There’s no doubting that French children are adorable when they talk (if you doubt it, just go YouTube French children, and you’ll change your mind), but this song was more an ad for good parenting values than an artistic achievement.
“Melody’s Echo Chamber” is a decent first album for Prochet, and her background in classical music makes her compositions audibly intriguing, but she still has a lot of learning to do. For now, her album is best listened to as background music for studying. Highly enjoyable, but equally forgettable.

“There are certain points in your career,” Karl Urban says somewhat incredulously, “where you can’t believe they’re actually letting you do what you’re doing.” Urban, as the law-dealing Judge Dredd in “Dredd 3D,” got to race through the streets of Cape Town, South Africa, on Dredd’s “Lawmaster” motorbike. “I wouldn’t let anyone else have the fun!”
Manifestations of such levity, however, were few and far between in the finished product. The film, which is based on the eponymous British comic strip, follows Judges Dredd and Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) as they attempt to take down a drug cartel operated by the ruthless Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) in a futuristic American police state. Beside some self-aware humor, the film is by and large a dark one. Dredd attacks, sentences, and kills criminals in a dank, overcrowded apartment complex rife with poverty and violence. Though the film is set in the dystopian Bos-Wash corridor known as Mega City One, its singular focus on the drug trade in one (albeit massive) apartment building, Peach Trees,  is remarkably claustrophobic.
For Urban, however, the setting wasn’t the only thing that was claustrophobic. Part of Dredd’s iconic costume included a helmet that obscured all of his face, except for his mouth, for the entirety of the film. “It took a while to figure [the helmet] out,” he said. “It was a challenge, and not only because my eyes were invisible but because of the fact that the character of Dredd operates within a very narrow band. He is a man who has been trained to keep his emotions in check.”
How then could he convey the character’s feelings? “The tools I had available were voice and physicality—those became extremely important in how you do something.”In order to research Dredd’s character, Urban, who was an avid fan of the comics when he was younger, welcomed the chance to indulge in nostalgia. “I got the voice from a particular panel I found in one of the comics which described Dredd’s voice as being like a saw cutting through bone, and that just resonated with me,” he said. “In our movie, Dredd uses his voice as a weapon, so I needed something that bridged that spectrum.” Urban was dedicated to organically creating Dredd’s voice without computerized enhancement, and in the end, the gravelly, powerful voice in the movie is his alone.
Though he was committed to embodying Dredd as fully physically as he did vocally, Urban ran into roadblocks early on. While filming “Red” in 2010, he had displaced his neck on a bad landing; he thus spent much of the three months he was allotted to get into shape for “Dredd” in and out of physical therapy. “It was daunting because of the way that the character was drawn,” Urban said. “He’s got this incredible physique, and there was a real pressure to get there.” He managed it in the end, but it wasn’t fun. “It was three months,” he said ruefully, “without booze and beer.”
In seeking to embody Dredd’s character, however, Urban explored far more than his voice and physical presence. “I discovered this whole plethora of stories that had been written subsequent to my reading the comic,” he recalled. “There was an incredible evolution in the maturity of the writing and this wonderful depth to the character that wasn’t really prevalent in the comic when I was reading it. You really get to understand the internal conflict within the character of Dredd.”
One main challenge of his role would be to externalize the feelings of such a stoic, ruthless character. “He has been trained to keep his emotions in check,” Urban said. “Consequently it was very important for me to identify how to humanize the character as much as possible.” In the end, it boiled down to one main goal: “Where is this character compassionate?”
Without his face to convey emotion, Urban brought out his character’s conflict through a heavy reliance on movement. Though Dredd starts off the film quite tightly-wound, as Urban put it, his ability to contain his physical reactions starts to crack as he witnesses a barrage of corrupt dealings and deaths in Peach Trees. “There’s a loss of innocent life in the film,” Urban says. “You see a significant gear shift in Dredd.”
“In the beginning of this movie you have this character who sees the world in terms of very black and white, right and wrong,” he explained. And it is this character’s evolution that forms much of the film’s emotional crux, 3D and startling graphics aside. “At the end of the film he’s just suddenly discovered this whole gray area, and that represents this fracture, this paradigm shift. Once you see something in life you can’t un-see it.”

Jesse A. Green ’02 and Michael Wang ’03, both graduates of the Visual and Environmental Studies Department, have curated shows of their own works in the main gallery of the Carpenter Center for Visual Arts in conjunction with the 50th anniversary celebration of the building. Wang’s exhibit, entitled “Differentiation Series,” features painted-over microscope images of stem cells that he created with Gabriella Boulting of the Kevin Eggan Lab. “Paranoia Places Its Faith in Exposure,” Green’s exhibition, displays over 40 works of video, paintings, drawings and sculpture and photographs. The artists explained how their exhibits relate to the history of the building.
The Harvard Crimson: How did you conceive of and develop your ideas for this show?
Jesse Aron Green: I’m really invested in the ideologies of mid-century art and architecture, and I wanted to engage those ideas, which have a lot to do with vision, ways of seeing and the ability to see through spaces, and the way in which spaces encode bodily habit. When I was in [the Carpenter Center] I had immediately an idea for the central piece, a large video installation projected onto [a] window...that would be rendered invisible during the day because of the light streaming through and would come alive at night and be seen from outside. From that initial hit upon the idea of translucence I started to create a whole body of work related to it.
Michael Wang: I was looking at a book by Sigfried Gideon called “Space Time and Architecture.” He has a section devoted to the Carpenter Center and describes the promise of the building as a place where people would...have a kind of interdisciplinary encounter in which they would explore new visual ideas. I wanted to think about that interdisciplinary promise and what that means today. Around that same time…I met [Gabriella Boulting]. The premise for her work is that artificially induced stem cells can become any cell in the human body. I ended up creating a pigment mixing system that produces 411 different distinct colors, matching the 411 recognized cell types in the human body.
THC: In what ways do you think your experience with this show was influenced by the fact that at one time you were a student taking classes in the building?
MW: I think that my feeling about the building has changed because it does have more of a feeling to me now as almost a museum piece, whereas when you’re in it everyday it’s much more of a kind of functional space…you stop seeing the building as much. Coming back to the building 10 or so years later puts me in a better position to really think about it in properly historical terms.
JAG: A big theme of my show is lineage and influence, not so hidden within that are a lot of references to Harvard and Harvardiana. That was a very self-conscious attempt to engage with the importance of this institution and how it’s influenced me.
THC: How do you think your respective works relate to and complement each other?
MW: We were both thinking about the history of this building. He was interested in using the space as a reference and almost as a part of the content of his work. My works almost are autonomous; it’s the one, temporary wall, whereas his works occupy the space in a much more diffused way. His is more about the specific architecture of the building, and mine is more about the way it was maybe meant to be programmed.
JAG: In one way they’re totally different…but you can see some themes. His work is about paintings that are made from research into the potentiality of stem cells to become differentiated, but from a more conceptual abstract point of view. It’s about how images might be made in a kind of automatic way. There’s a system … and you might see something similar in some of my work. The white drawings are created according to a system: a laser cutter burns the paper and the letters get cut out. It creates this image but also has these things that I can’t predict: little burn marks, smoke marks.
THC: What do you hope people take away from the show?
JAG: It’s very hard within the realm of the visual to dictate something specific that you want the viewer to take away. At the same time, this exhibition is very much composed [of] the interaction of different kinds of formal procedures and objects. The idea of translucence…might allow a viewer to tie [these pieces] together and see them in conjunction with one another.
MW: [At the opening] there were these … two discrete interpretations of the work in the format of a gallery tour. At one end of the wall was [Boulting], and on the other was [Jennifer Quick] who’s pursuing a PhD in art history, each…presenting their interpretations of the works, based on their disciplinary expertise. I want people to see how we can make two systems coincide in a way that can seem inevitable, but showing how that’s constructed and in the end a little bit arbitrary. The images are kind of dumb in themselves; they can be used and appropriated in very different ways depending on the perspective of the person who’s encountering the works.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Middle East Downstairs in Cambridge is known for playing host to a wide range of eccentric sights and sounds, and last Tuesday night was no exception. Homemade instruments, shirts with colorful tassels haphazardly glued on, free jazz voyages, and goofy arm-waving routines all played a role over the course of the evening. Brooklyn-based Buke and Gase and San Francisco-based Deerhoof shared the bill, and each captivated with their own brand of eccentricity. Buke and Gase delivered a superb set of stomping and frenetic music, while Deerhoof delighted with their energy and seemingly endless arsenal of musical styles.
The duo Buke and Gase performed sitting down, out of necessity. Aside from playing the self-invented ‘buke,’ a baritone ukulele, and ‘gass,’ a guitar/bass hybrid, lead singer Arone Dyer and instrumentalist Aron Sanchez each used their feet to operate a ‘toe-bourine’ and a kick drum.
The group’s multi-instrumentalism was impressive given the complex rhythmic and melodic lines each instrument produced. At times, Dyer simultaneously sang vocal lines with massive interval jumps while playing math rock riffs on her buke and tapping out arrhythmic accents with her toe-bourine. Buke and Gase’s impeccable musicality was especially on display during their performances of “Tending the Talk” and “Misshaping Introduction,” both off the band’s recently released EP “Function Falls.” The studio versions are complex to the point that the instruments seem overdubbed, so it was very impressive to see a faithful reproduction of them performed live.
While their performance skills are first-class, Dyer and Sanchez truly shine in their ability to compose a song. A typical Buke and Gase track incorporates a variety of distinct, challenging musical concepts in a way that feels natural and organized. Stylistically, Buke and Gase are similar to tUnE-yArDs and Dirty Projectors in their use of unusual intervals and phrasing in their vocal lines and their repetitive, building instrumental structures, although they treat their craft with more solemnity than either group.
Buke and Gase produced eminently danceable rhythms throughout their tight, 45-minute set, but the crowd at the Middle East was tame. Because the duo was seated, they interacted with the crowd very little. This, combined with recurring microphone amplifier issues, the fact that the band largely played material from an upcoming record (to be released in January), and the group’s seriousness, discouraged audience participation.
The mood changed instantly when Deerhoof took the stage half an hour later. The group ripped through several cuts off their latest record, “Breakup Song,” at torrential speeds. This harsh, driving style was somewhat unexpected, because “Breakup Song” is a poppy, electronic, and sonically-reserved album.
It probably shouldn’t have come as a surprise, though. Since their formation in San Francisco in 1994, the group has thrived on its willingness to experiment. Case in point: the group took on Japanese film student Satomi Matsuzaki as lead singer in 1996, even though she had no prior musical experience. Since gaining widespread recognition for their 2002 album “Reveille,” Deerhoof have reinvented their musical style on each subsequent album, incorporating noise rock, rockabilly, electronica, and jazz into an overall sound that is still unmistakably their own.
Because of this, Deerhoof’s live act felt constantly on edge and subject to rapid shifts in musical style, speed, and sonic intensity at the drop of a hat. Frequently, the group broke into loud, lengthy, and dissonant instrumental sections that felt entirely improvised, but they would just as quickly break back out of them into a bouncy chorus.
This give-and-take between order and chaos was best illustrated by the stage presences of guitarist Ed Rodriguez and drummer Greg Saunier. Rodriguez careened around the stage, hair whipping back and forth, and frequently dove into exploratory free jazz guitar interludes between songs. On the other hand, Saunier, who was dripping with sweat by the fourth song due to his furious drumming, frequently turned to the sound technicians and asked for slight adjustments for certain instruments. Rodriguez wanted concertgoers to wonder if the band had any idea what they were doing, but Saunier’s precise tweaking revealed the answer.
Deerhoof’s best songs were the ones that put the spotlight on Matsuzaki. During the band’s performance of “Flower,” Matsuzaki provided powerfully eerie vocals over the Sonic Youth-like verses and effortlessly shifted into a sunny, exhuberant chorus.
On the group’s final song of the night, “Basket Ball Get Your Groove Back,” Matsuzaki channeled a quirky Japanese rock style, leading the crowd in a hilarious sing-along of the track’s minimalist lyrics (“Basket ball Basket ball Basket/Dribble/Pivot Pivot Pivot Pivot/Escape”). The song was a fittingly outlandish close to a wonderfully strange night.

Audience members in the front row of seats at “Titus Andronicus” may be surprised at the end of the play to see themselves spattered with blood. But perhaps they shouldn’t be. The Hyperion Shakespeare Company production—directed by Jacob A. Brandt ’14 and running through September 29 at the Loeb Ex is, after all, one of Shakespeare's darkest pieces.
“Titus” has always presented a problem for theater companies: to do Shakespeare justice requires a willingness to experiment with subtext and draw out his plays’ tragic and comic potential, but “Titus” is a distractingly graphic piece and does not lend itself easily to nuanced acting. However, this performance, while far from exploring the tragic nature of the play, distinguishes itself with an attention to the suggestive text, bringing out the dark humor of a piece that Shakespeare enthusiasts were historically slow to appreciate.
Dating from around 1593, “The Tragedy of Titus Andronicus” rivals even modern tales of violence for its blend of rage and sadistic deception. General Andronicus (Joshua G. Wilson ’13) returns to Rome having lost 21 of his sons in wars for his Empire, and in a moment of prideful vengeance executes the eldest son of Tamora (Sara S. Lytle ’13), the imprisoned queen of the Goths. Tamora sends two of her other sons Demetrius (Jesse T. Nee-Vogelman ’13) and Chiron (Sam B. Clark ’15) to get revenge on Titus and his family, with the assistance of her evil Moorish lover Aaron (Spencer J. Horne ’14). This leads Titus in turn to seek dangerous retributions.
The actors consistently struggle to bring the play’s tragic elements to the forefront. Wilson's displays of grief at seeing his children murdered and despoiled are disappointingly flat in the first acts. However, he is marvelously good at being evil. “You know,” he says to an advisary before cutting his throat, “your mother means to feast with me.” When Wilson combines these words—which in the original text might have appeared angry or coldly matter-of-fact—with a diabolical grin, maniacal dancing, and a singsong voice, he becomes at once truly chilling and unexpectedly funny. Wilson impresses with the complexity of his mixed bitterness and his amusement at the irony of his own position —once great defender of the just, now himself turned savagely destructive.
The ill-doers are especially charming here. Lytle is a superbly sensual Tamora; slithering and caressing as she curries favors from men, she brilliantly reveals the sexual undertones of the text. Horne, also an admirable villain,  is probably the best of the show. He subtly balances an urbane understated contempt with remorseless glee in seeing victims fall for his machinations. But he also brings in a trace of human intellectual complexity that, in a play otherwise regarded as less than cerebral, is much appreciated. Horne’s meditative opening soliloquy as he sits suspended over Rome carries a Hamletian quality of profound contemplation.
There were several entertaining gems among the supporting parts as well. Titus’ mild brother Marcus (Aaron Graham-Horowitz ’15) is a funny foil for the violent displays of the others. A surly, strapping Saturninus (Caleb J. T. Thompson ’14, a Crimson arts writer) and benign Bassianus (Eli E. Kahn ’13), who each plead their side as contestants to the imperial throne, complement each other quite comically. Nee-Vogelman and Clark were uproariously iniquitous as the torturers of Titus’ hapless daughter Lavinia (Alice Abracen ’15).
In the set and costume designs, the show’s dark comic thread is cleverly enriched by references to various tropes in American culture. Isabel Strauss ’13’s stage design looks like a barnyard, with rows of huge crates taking up the entire left side of the stage. The Roman soldiers are in military camouflage, their swords supplanted by revolvers. The Emperor walks stoutly about in suspenders, and the Goths are now gothic teens with torn black T-shirts, studded skinny jeans, and Halloween-style scars. Brandt draws interesting parallels to modern day politics by dressing opposing actors in suits like modern election candidates, having them deliver speeches in their bids for the Roman throne. Sounds between scenes, in a similar fashion, alternated between surf music, 20’s style jazz, and horror-movie soundtracks, and were on the whole a bit distracting. But at their best, they highlighted the irony and enhanced the cruelly farcical center of the play.
While “Titus Andronicus” can be at once tragic and comic, unfortunately nobody in this performance comes near to showing a consistent understanding of real evil or grief. But the actors, to their credit, do enliven us with credibly irreverent re-imaginations of Shakespeare’s darker moments.

The title character’s hairdo isn’t the only thing reaching too high in “Marie Antoinette,” a new show written by David Adjmi and directed by Rebecca Taichman. As befitting its enlightenment era context, lots of ideas are thrown around—many philosophers are referenced and many parallels are drawn to the reviled one percenters of Occupy movement vernacular—but when push comes to shove (or heads come to roll), none of these thoughts are developed clearly enough to leave a lasting impression. Though the production—playing at the American Repertory Theater through September 29—benefits from stunning stage design and an array of extravagant costumes as mouth-watering as the trays of French sweets that frame them, the script of “Marie Antoinette” has little to offer in the way of textual significance.
“Marie Antoinette” chronicles the reign, removal, and eventual beheading of France’s most infamous queen. The first half of the play consists of a series of comic vignettes: Marie (Brooke Bloom) is seen gossiping with her girlfriends, playing at shepherdess, and so on. These scenes, while arranged chronologically, are only peripherally concerned with specific events, seeming to exist in the same state of floaty vacuousness as Marie herself. Act two, in contrast, is essentially an hour-long, exceedingly dour march to the scaffold.
Though the French queen’s demise is well trodden material, a novel viewpoint might have injected life into this somewhat battle-worn premise. However, a unifying theme is just what seems to be lacking in “Marie Antoinette.” Adjmi’s script is not without its merits—there are witty barbs galore—but its want of a clear message leaves one puzzled and ultimately dissatisfied.
Several issues figure into the play’s opacity. One is the absence of characters that we can root for. In “Marie Antoinette,” the existence of two camps, haves and have-nots, is obvious. But with whom is the audience meant to empathize? Certainly not the strident, razor-wielding youth who spouts maxims at Marie as he hacks off her hair. But it’s equally hard to feel for the out-of-touch royal couple who bemoan their celebrity status and resort to questioning a country bumpkin in order to determine whether windmills have any non-aesthetic purpose. This is a hard sell at best, made more difficult by scenes where Marie is confronted by a philosopher-sheep (David Greenspan) who challenges her worldviews. These scenes, while amusing enough, threaten to breach the line separating artsy from silly.
However befuddled one may be as to the point of the play, one does not leave the theater questioning Bloom’s commitment to her role. Her vision of Marie Antoinette may not be deserving of the melodramatic send-off Adjmi has written her, but Bloom makes the best of what she has to work with. Her Marie is a coddled, poorly educated (by her own reckoning, “virtually illiterate”) nymph whose inefficacy and hyperactivity find an outlet in sky-high hairdos and gowns whose dimensions are suggestive of a drag force equation. If Bloom’s Marie is not twitching her way up and down the stage, she’s swaying in place or tapping her shoes. By the intermission, one is persuaded to pity the fool, and Marie takes on a new dimension in Act two. Held captive and compelled to defend positions she cannot understand, Marie’s agitated state conveys a sort of plucky resolve one cannot help but admire.
The other 12 actors in the production are given comparatively little to work with. Steven Rattazzi is pleasingly buffoonish as the Louis XVI, but his portrayal of the doomed king as a man-child incapable of making adult decisions hardly covers new ground. Jake Silbermann is debonair as can be in the role of Marie’s lover Axel Fersen, but his character’s sole function is to act as a sort of human springboard: his throw-away lines only to prompt Marie’s weightier monologues.
The textual failings of “Marie Antoinette” are very nearly compensated for by the richness of the show’s design. In Act one, garish lights bathe each scene in a hue that is at once electrifying and sickly sweet. The effect is to underscore both the excesses of Marie’s court and the frenetic nature of Marie herself. In Act two, a spotlight renders her powdered face stunningly ghost-like, highlighting her impending doom. Equally impressive are the efforts of costume designer Gabriel Berry. Far more engaging then many of the characters in “Marie Antoinette” are the gowns, shoes, and wigs they are garbed in.
Despite the elaborate costumes design and admerable performances from the leads,  “Marie Antionette”  ultimately fails to support its visual aesthetics.

At this point in time, renowned director Roman Polanski is more likely to be criticized for his dubious legal situation than he has ever been for his films, which have often garnered wide acclaim. That is, of course, if one ignores the case of Tim M. Hunter ’68, who, in a 1968 Crimson article, argued that Polanski’s films “have apparently fallen into every cinematic pitfall readily available.”
Was Hunter reviewing one of the Polish master’s lesser works? Nope. The quote comes from a review of “Rosemary’s Baby,” a film Hunter deemed a “a pointless and supremely mediocre melodrama” and “ugly—aesthetically derelict, the groping of a bombed-out mind.”
There are many valid reasons to condemn a movie—bad haircuts, vapid dialogue, uninspired visuals—but an unhappy ending doesn’t always top the list. But this is Hunter’s main complaint—he notes that “the witches win... [and] Rosemary accepts Satan’s spawn as her son,” then takes a stand against this madness, declaring “there are too many reasons around for not affirming devil worship to allow us to accept Polanski’s recent films without pausing for thought.” Spoiler alert!
Though “Rosemary’s Baby” is undoubtedly a disturbing film, Hunter’s argument seems problematic—the idea that an unhappy ending is tantamount to sympathy for evil forces does not quite add up. If “Rosemary’s Baby” is pro-Satan, that makes “Terms of Endearment” pro-cancer.
To be fair, Hunter was smart to refute the late-’60s hype of Polanski as the next Alfred Hitchcock. But “Rosemary’s Baby,” perhaps Polanski’s finest work of suspense and tension, doesn’t seem like the film to illustrate that dismissal. Had Hunter been reviewing the director’s “Pirates” or “Oliver Twist” instead, some of his criticisms would have found a worthier target.

Descend into the depths of Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum, down a flight of stairs, and through basement corridors, and you’ll find the grotto of curatorial assistant Susan Hardy Brown. Her door-less room is filled with artwork, boxes of newspapers, photos, and plant specimens. Giant metal cabinets line one wall, full of flora waiting to be cataloged, and artwork from Hardy Brown’s most recent exhibit leans against the other. On her desk is a half finished specimen sheet, on which a plant is mounted with a label.
Hardy Brown’s artworks, which were recently exhibited in “Ex Herbario: Recent Works by Susan Hardy Brown” at the Arnold Arboretum’s Hunnewell Visitor Center, are collages of paper and plant matter stuck down by beeswax and resin. Like Hardy Brown herself, who plays dual roles as artist and curatorial assistant, her mixed-media artwork crosses disciplinary boundaries.
Hardy Brown studied painting at Syracuse University and Massachusetts College of Art and Design, from which she graduated in 1969 and 1975 respectively. She found her place at the Arboretum through her love for art. “With my background in the arts, preparing the specimens was really hands-on and something I really enjoyed and figured I could do,” Hardy Brown said. She volunteered for a project at the Arboretum in 1985, and when she was looking for a long-term job, she says, the Arboretum felt like a niche where she could keep nourishing her artistic side.
Almost all of the materials Hardy Brown collected for “Ex Herbario” came from the packaging and labeling of the plant specimens she has worked with for 26 years. Specimens reach her two different ways: through collection, which is paid for and sponsored by Harvard, and through exchange with other herbaria and arboretums around the world. The exhibit title “Ex Herbario” came from the latter. “When there’s an exchange and the specimen is sent, it will sometimes say the institution, ‘ex herbario,’ and then the Latin name,” she said. The title is fitting because materials from the exhibit came from the herbarium, she says. ”And I just liked the way it sounded,” she added.
Hardy Brown creates her pieces through the “encaustic” technique, in which heated adhesives are painted over a surface and sometimes embedded with other materials—in this case, paper and pressed plants in a mixture of beeswax and damar resin. The most common plant packaging she comes across is newspaper—“That’s the most universally available material, and it’s absorbent and it’s cheap,” she said—but other materials she has acquired include delicate rice papers and snack food packaging. “Working here all these years and saving different, interesting materials—they lent themselves to the technique I was using, because you can preserve and layer [them],” she said.
She saved newspapers, wrappers, and extra plants sent from a variety of times and places. Using these different materials adds a global and historical element to her work. When she got the job, she says, there was a 30-year backlog of specimens, still wrapped in newsprint, waiting to be cataloged. “I’m down here in this very meditative environment, and I’m opening up these folders and reliving the Vietnam War,” Hardy Brown said.
In one of her pieces, she overlaid news clippings from that time period in English, Vietnamese, Spanish and other languages, then adorned the newsprint collage with pieces of collected plant matter. She has also made replicas of Buddhist prayer flags from Thai snack wrappers, a quilt-like piece based around the patron saint of Cuba, and what she calls an homage to Jackson Pollock—a small piece in which she wildly arrayed strings from plant labels and then glued them down in the encaustic technique.
Danielle Hanrahan, a curatorial assistant for the Harvard University Herbaria who also helped Hardy Brown set up the “Ex Herbario” exhibit, says Hardy Brown’s artistic inclinations in turn inform her work at the arboretum. “In some ways, I think that an art background—being skilled with your hands and using tools and knowing materials and having an aesthetic sensibility—is maybe more important than knowing the Latin names of all the plants that you’re actually mounting,” Hanrahan said.
Hardy Brown says she will likely continue to use materials she collects in the Arboretum for future encaustic artworks—“I’ve become the ultimate recycler,” she said. “This stuff is being used, and then I’m reusing it in another way altogether.” But her work does not just provide the components of her art, she says—the Arboretum also inspires her. “It’s been a very rich environment to work in, and the actual work that I do here is kind of quiet, contemplative, meditative,” she said. “It leaves my mind free."

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A woman’s dead husband, whose powdery face streches six feet wide, smiles eerily from the corner of the room, broken light bulbs emphasizing the folds of his puffy disco cap. The portrait is too heavy to hang on the museum wall, so it simply rests against it, waiting patiently for the next unsuspecting passerby (in this case, myself). There’s no getting around it: this painting is bad--bad enough to warrant a confused double-take by any onlooker, never mind conventional museum goers. However this painting, aptly titled “Man in a Puffy Disco Hat,” hangs not in a foyer or over a dinner table, but on the wall of the Museum of Bad Art.
While some of the museum’s pieces have evidence of artistic talent—deft brush technique, attention to detail, innovative use of color—there is something off the mark about every work in the museum’s collection. “Our definition of ‘bad art’ is pieces that cannot be ignored but will never make it into a traditional museum;” says Louise Sacco, Director of MoBA. “It’s something that is compelling but you can see there’s something that went wrong there.” Looking at a painting of a tree with massive eyes for leaves and bulging breasts coming out of the trunk, I could see Sacco’s point.
Identifying bad art is a matter of gut instinct, according to JamesHallowell, self-proclaimed bad-art connoisseur and long-time supporter of the museum. He has a very simple definition of bad art. “Bad art to me is very different from just lousy or boring art,” he says. “Bad art is not just badly done art; you have to look at it and go, ‘What the fuck?!’” There is no need to scrutinize and analyze what precisely makes the art so bad; the answer becomes clear walking into the museum. In a world where art is easily over-thought, MoBA stands out for its accessibility to visitors.
BASEMENT MONSTROSITY
Similar to the pieces it exhibits, MoBA began by accident. but with good intentions. On a night in the early 90s, Scott Wilson, antiques dealer and former curator of MoBA, was looking through trash for salvageable antiques when he found an awful painting. He figured he could reuse the frame, but Sacco’s brother, Jerry Reilly, insisted that Wilson give the piece to him to hang in his basement. This led to a sea of friends donating their cherished eyesores until it culminated in a celebration, in jest, of ‘the opening of the Museum of Bad Art.’ Through word-of-mouth, 200 guests attended the opening in the basement brimming over with atrocities.“
He had the museum in his house for probably two years,” Sacco says. “The day a bus load of seniors from Rhode Island showed up at his house, we knew we had to change it.” And thus  MoBA moved to the Dedham Community Theatre and has since grown to three galleries in the Boston area: one in Brookline, one in Dedham, and one in Somerville.
What started as a joke between friends soon grew to be a world-renowned collection. “We’ve been featured in Wired; The Rolling Stone; the London Times; the Bulgarian version of Playboy, every in-flight magazine, even ones I’d never heard of. We’ve had a T.V. crew with Katie Couric turn up, we’ve been on Indonesian radio… It just goes on and on,” Sacco says.
Despite the extent of their media attention, MoBA is still very much a mom-and-pop gallery that cares about its local supporters. “It’s really interesting: by some measures, it’s been enormously popular,” Sacco says, sitting with me in a sleepy, Davis Square café.  “We have a big mailing list, thousands of followers on Facebook. But ask the next people walking down the street,” she says, gesturing out the window with her mug of coffee, “and maybe one will have heard of us.” Though the museum has earned Katie Couric’s attention, the institution maintains a low profile in the neighborhood.
ISLAND OF MISFIT TOYS
The museum has exhibitions all over the country and receives art from all over the world. When MoBA started before the digital age, it would receive anonymous submissions—some of which would have a future in the gallery—rather than emailed photos from fans. Now, pieces are usually pre-approved by the museum’s curator, Michael Frank. I was at his house to witness the welcome arrival of such a piece.
“It’s like Christmas,” Frank says, bringing over a large, brown-colored box to his dining room table. He looks at the return address and ponders for a moment. “Rochester, NY. Hmm… I think I know who this is from.” Carefully slicing the bubble wrap with an X-Acto knife, he studies the art piece. He uses the same scrutiny any curator would use in examining a historical masterpiece even though the painting in question is a reddish-orange scene of cartoon-eyed spiders dropping from the sky, preying on ant-covered peaches with giant droplets of juice dripping from the fruit. “It’s on the border,” Frank says. By that he means that it’s not quite bad enough.
“People send us things for the same reason we collected them,” Sacco says. “They know it’s not good. Maybe they hang it up in the dining room and their family yells at them, but it’s so compelling, engaging, exciting that they don’t want it to disappear.” The museum serves as a refuge for this orphaned art, provided it meets a certain level of repulsiveness. “We have been very clear in our mission and that is to collect, exhibit and celebrate the worst of the art world,” Sacco says. “In our world, [art] has to do with things that are sincere, things that are trying to communicate something. We think art is something that looks for an audience.” MoBA is perhaps the only place these unappreciated artworks can fulfill their purpose; to be seen and enjoyed.
HAPA GAUGIN
It may seem odd that artists would send in their artwork to the museum, acknowledging that this time, their artistic endeavor was less than successful. And what about the artists whose work is simply found in a thrift store and displayed, unbeknownst to them? Is it not a bit offensive?
Sacco acknowledges this concern. “That was a big worry for us at the start. We don’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings. Then artists started to send in their own work, which was puzzling. But when you think about it, an artist can’t lose: if we turn them down they say, ‘Okay, I’m not that bad,’ and if we accept them they can say, ‘I’m in a museum,’” Sacco says. She estimates that as many as 20 pieces in the museum’s collection have been donated by professional artists.
Roger Hanson is among them. An eighty-year-old former salesman, he now spends his retirement touring the globe, writing novels and selling his artwork at shows featuring mostly abstract art. A few years ago, before driving from Minnesota to New York for a show, Hanson stumbled across an article in the local paper written by Louise Sacco.“My first reaction was, ‘Who would want to be in the Museum of Bad Art?’” he says. “But then the more I thought about it, a museum is a museum.” Hanson gave Sacco a call and then swung through Boston with two of his paintings that he figured suited the museum. Sacco accepted his submission and now both pieces are featured at the museum. Hanson looks upon his inclusion in the museum with no shame. On the contrary, he takes pride in having his work, including the Gaugin-inspired painting “Half Polynesian, Half Norwegian,” which features a naked woman with long blond hair and a platter of flowers, exhibited at the MoBA.
“DRILLING FOR EGGS”
Though the artists can benefit from inclusion in the museum, why employees would volunteer their time to celebrate what is, by conventional standards, unimportant art is less clear. All of those affiliated with MoBA, including Sacco and Frank, devote their time without pay solely because they enjoy the work. Sacco is retired and Frank is a musician and balloon maker, yet both are devoted to making the museum as quirky and beloved as possible. With an active Facebook page, two published books featuring the museum’s work, and a mobile phone App in the works, MoBA admittedly requires more work than your typical hobby, which is perhaps why most volunteers come and go. “We get some of the real stereotypical, academic artsy types and people who are deep in the world of art and appreciate what we’re doing,” Sacco says.
Given the museum’s mission, it might seem strange that art professionals volunteer, but Sacco sees it differently. “If anything, we’re making fun of the critics, not the artists,” she says.The MoBA is serious about not taking things too seriously. The collection is supplemented more often than not by yard sale or thrift store runs, but the descriptions accompanying each piece on display are written in the air of very serious captions seen in more conventional museums. Frank, who writes many of the labels, puts considerable time and effort into formulating just the right zing to adequately capture the atrocity of each piece.
Frank’s talent shines in a description of the piece, “Drilling for Eggs”: “Green alligator flames dominate the foreground and a bright pink sky provides the backdrop for this disquieting depiction of a color-altered future in which eggs, a renewable resource, have replaced traditional hydrocarbon fuels. The artist is saying, in no uncertain terms, that unless we learn to conserve our priceless resources, the yolk will be on us.” Aside from providing museum visitors with a chuckle, the captions are one of many lighthearted ways MoBA uses to contrast their mission from those of their more academic counterparts.
SURROUNDED BY CLOWNS
The act of distinguishing between good and bad art may come with criticisms from the art world, but MoBA has no qualms about stepping on a few toes.“ There are people who want to say there is no such thing as bad art and I have no patience for that. If there’s no such thing as bad art, there’s no such thing as good art,” Sacco says. “Others want to question, ‘What is bad art?’ Well, we are the museum, we get to say, and there is a huge consensus of people who agree with our judgment.” Though the museum has a sense of humor about their mission, they have firm criteria. “If it’s bad and boring, we don’t care,” Sacco says.
However, Justine De Young, Harvard preceptor in Expository Writing for courses including ““Orientalism in Art, Literature & Film” who holds a Ph.D. in art history from Northwestern University, questions the validity of passing such judgments. “The whole concept makes me nervous because a lot of art movements were considered bad art at the time and we’ve come to realize their value today,” De Young says. “The Impressionists, the Fauvists… A lot of artists have been misunderstood.” It is doubtful that in thirty years, “A Man in a Puffy Disco Cap” will be considered a masterpiece, but the subjectivity of artistic judgment influence the designation of art.
 Hallowell is quick to note the blurry divide between good and bad art. “I’ll be in a gallery or museum and think, ‘that’s MoBA quality! It’s in the wrong place!’” he says with a laugh.
The museum holds high standards for its badness, holding an auction once a year that they affectionately call the “salon des rejetées,” of work not deemed “bad enough,” yet another example of the aura of humor surrounding the MoBA. Walking into their collection in the basement of the Somerville Theater—just a few T stops away from Harvard Square—my first instinct was to laugh. Surrounded by pictures of sickly clowns and demonic babies staring down from the walls, one can’t help but feel a bit refreshed by the monstrosity. It is especially hard to take the museum seriously when they themselves have such an unorthodox press and management approach. In 1996 a piece called “Eileen” was stolen from the museum and a jest reward of $6.50, later raised to $36.73, was offered for its return. The museum now has fake video cameras up for protection.
GUGGENHEIM SCUFFLE
Frederick Ilchman, Mrs. Russell W. Baker Curator of Paintings at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, acknowledges that while the MoBA’s curation process may differ, their selection criteria has merit. “Unlike reality T.V., these artists aren’t looking for fame,” Ilchman says. “Anyone can do something poorly, but to do something professionally and poorly, that’s something else.” He compares their sincerity with the recent botching of a Christ fresco restoration in Borja, Italy by 80-year-old Cecilia Giménez, who has no professional experience in restoration. “It’s become this pilgrimage site; it’s so bad it’s good. There, [Giménez] was trying very hard, just like some other people [in the museum] were trying to make good art.” The fresco is now ruined by the failed restoration attempt, but Ilchman says with a chuckle, “Maybe the larger lesson is that we shouldn’t take anything too seriously.”
The climate in the art world is changing, but Ilchman says it’s not necessarily a bad thing. “The Guggenheim had five locations and two have closed, while the MoBA has three outposts and is only expanding; they’re challenging the Guggenheim!” Ilchman says. “A lot of art can make the viewer feel ill informed. Some of it has been criticized by people saying, ‘My kid could do that.’ The wonderful thing about the Museum of Bad Art is that yeah, your kid probably could do that. The Boston cultural landscape is all the richer for it.” Although far from high-brow, the MoBA provides perhaps the only artistic niche not filled in a culture-laden city.
Despite potential arguments to be made against labeling art as good or bad, the enjoyment one gains from the museum is unquestionable. The MoBA is less of a rebellion against the world of art criticism than it is a celebration of all the art world has to offer, gruesome or gorgeous. “I enjoy the MoMA, I enjoy the ICA, but I do a lot of eye rolling at those places,” says Frank. “I think many people, whether consciously or subconsciously, roll their eyes, also. Something about the art world and the pomposity, the museum speak and self-conscious art—it takes itself so seriously that it leads itself to being made fun of.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As a child, I went to church weekly with my family. I also prayed once a day, usually before going to sleep. My parents taught me that religion should be respected, even if one did not believe in it literally. Without saying so, they were trying to teach me a lesson in humility—that I should always leave space for the mysterious in life, whether that mystery was called God, or The Lack Thereof. But even with the playful imagination of a child, this lesson made no sense to me. I was curious. I wanted to understand, not mystify.
A rebellion occurred one night when I was ten. I was praying in bed when I suddenly felt embarrassed. Who was I praying to? And wasn’t prayer a selfish act? Even when I wasn’t asking favors from God, it felt like a contract where I secretly hoped to win some nebulous reward. Enough, I thought. I decided to stop praying. That was my only decision that night: no more prayers.
When I turned eleven, I began attending a local Catholic school. I went there for seven years—all of middle and high school. Administered by an eccentric band of priests, the school was religiously and socially conservative. We had religion class four times a week. The student body came primarily from a middle-class Republican background.
At first, I enjoyed the school. The teachers were kind and dedicated in their teaching. But as sixth grade became seventh, and seventh flowed into eighth, I realized something was bothering me, and it involved religion class.
To begin with, I could not understand how belief could be taught. I had no problems with math and Latin because they did not ask for belief. I did not care about geometric formulae and Latin conjugations as long as I did well on the tests. But the topics we brushed in religion were so fundamental in their scope that I could not ignore their significance. To me, it did make a difference whether the earth was six thousand years old or four and a half billion. I also could not figure out where heaven was located. Was it in between the thermosphere and the mesosphere, or closer to Mars? I assumed hell was at the center of the earth, but how did the bodies get there?
My facetiousness aside, what really got me burning was the lack of curiosity among the students around me. And that’s when I started causing trouble. I had shouting matches with my religion teacher. I refused to say the morning prayer, salute the flag, or go to church. I began reading social commentary on religion. I called myself a Marxist at fourteen. My favorite author became Richard Dawkins, the fervent British “new atheist.” Three friends of mine with similar ideas created an informal club, sharing articles and videos on a nascent Facebook. To us, the world was black or white. You either saw life through the senses or through an invisible man in the sky.
Something went awry when I discovered that my best friend was the most Christian kid in school. Unlike the other students who called themselves Christian without a strong desire to understand what that meant, my friend was consistent: he believed and lived his faith. His beliefs were ludicrous, but what did that matter when he was a beautiful human being? He was a pure, beaming candle.
Much has happened since middle and high school. Life has thrown much at me and I have thrown myself at it harder. Love and pain began moderating my zeal. The answers I was looking for were not resolvable into formulas or philosophies, as I originally wished. Neither logic nor faith soothed me. Science explained the world to me rationally. Religion explained it through metaphors.
And that is how I found myself gaining increasing meaning from mysteries rather than answers. Wikipedia answers all the questions I have. But the answers have lost their meaning in a disenchanted world. How will I tell God that we found Him in the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva? And what future will science give man once the material paradise is reached?
It is not answers I want, for I find more beauty in contemplating the mysterious and accepting the outrageous. Did you know a group of fairies lives in the basement of Weld? Demons dance around Lowell Bell Tower. Trees make good conversation around 4:30 AM, if you try hard to talk to them. Watch the sky tomorrow. It may thunder molten tigers.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In 1919, Baseball was tarnished by eight players on the Chicago White Sox who threw the World Series for a minor profit. The 1919 World Series remained the most high profile case of a thrown competition for almost a century.
At least, until 2012.
Lately, presidential candidate Mitt Romney has turned deliberate self-destruction into an art form, delivering a performance comparable in both cruelty and creativity to the proverbial performance artist who tied a starving dog to the wall of an art gallery to die.
He is making a mockery of our democracy, and The Harvard Crimson will not stand for it. Our form of government depends on the good-faith participation of both major parties. When one candidate chooses to throw an election instead of trying to win, the sanctity of our republic is diminished, the quality of our leadership is reduced, and the financial contributions of our wealthiest citizens are wasted. As political scientists can attest, the perpetual tug-of-war between pitchfork-wielding, Apocalypse-awaiting reactionaries and latte-sipping gay supremacists is one of the few things keeping us from the terrifying descent into tyranny. By effectively removing Republican participation from the 2012 presidential race, Mitt Romney has pushed us one step closer to Beijing-style autocracy.
Although Romney’s political suicide is, at this point, a matter of doubt only among the delusional, it may be worth running through a few instances to outline just how egregious is his delivery.
For starters, he spent a solid two minutes insulting poor, elderly, and disabled people, suggesting that they do not have “personal responsibility and care for their lives.” He made these comments at a fundraiser hosted by a hedge-fund manager. Unsatisfied by merely offending the disadvantaged, he openly stated that he would not make any attempt to seek their votes. While he claimed not to know that he was being filmed, his monologue sounded too much like it was written by Democratic strategists—or at least someone hell-bent on making sure Romney never gets elected. One is forced to speculate that it was deliberate.
As if the heartless plutocrat routine wasn’t sufficient to cost him the election, Romney also publically disavowed any attempt to seek a resolution in the Mideast conflict, opting instead to “kick the ball down the field.” And Monday, in effort to come across as unintelligent (despite evidence to the contrary), he stated that he “do[esn’t] know why [airplane windows] don’t [open].”
All indications suggest that Romney’s cynical attempt to lose the election is working. Recent polls show Romney trailing in every swing state. The New York Times’ expert statistician Nate R. Silver gives him a less than 25 percent chance of winning on November 6.  He still has three debates left to drive that down to maybe 10 or 15 percent. Our guess is that he’ll jump at the opportunity.
No one can say with any certainty why Romney is bothering to run at all if he’s just going to throw the race. Running for president is supposed to be immensely stressful and financially costly. Perhaps he’s looking to short his stocks on InTrade or is secretly the liberal many conservatives fear he is, and he is trying to deliver a death blow to the Republican party. No matter how you slice it, shame on you, Mr. Romney.

Stirring speeches were once the stuff that President Obama’s dreams were made of. But Obama recently squandered his chance to deliver a bold address at the Democratic National Convention that acknowledged his administration’s failures, provide an audacious view of his next term, and rise above the partisan squabbling. In four years, Obama has moved on from “Change” to a tired, unenthusiastic drive “Forward,” even if we are headed in the wrong direction.
The charisma that once captured the heart of the nation and world has receded to tepid capitulations under waves of harsh realities, economic sluggishness, and Republican obstinacy. The one-time constitutional law professor no longer argues his case to America. In lieu of direct appeals to the citizenry, we are treated to outsourced sermons through his proxies: Joe Biden tells us that Obama is courageous, the First Lady assures that he is compassionate, and Bill Clinton explains that the president isn’t clueless. From the president himself, America only receives ambiguous declarations, anti-Romney bromides, and vague pleas.
Both candidates seem intent on playing the safe and narrow game: eschewing the bold for the benign in order to capture 51 percent of the vote. Romney and Ryan, reticent as ever on the actual details of their “plan” to resuscitate the drowning economy, are more content with crucifying Obama’s straw men to pander to party hardliners. Meanwhile, Obama blames his lapses of leadership on debt crises, healthcare, and stimulus bills onto admittedly disgusting Congressional partisanship. Yet it seems that our president would rather keep his head above the fray and have his lackeys argue on his behalf than get his hands dirty in enumerating his grievances to the American people. Right-wing hyperpartisanship and left-wing spinelessness are collectively bankrupting American faith in a crumbling political system.
But both campaigns are bankrolled by the unlimited, anonymous legalized bribes flowing through super PACs. Extremely wealthy donors on both sides of the aisle have crowded out the voices of average American voters in the aftermath of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling. Both parties, rather than express horror at the Frankensteinian transformation of our democracy into a de facto plutocracy, have been content to accept the tainted funds quietly. The political structure is much more beholden to special interest groups than to the interests of average citizens, many of whom, rightly nihilistic about the significance of their voices, simply choose political apathy. This dispirited political climate will likely depress the Democratic turnout, making it possible for a popular president to lose to his awkward challenger.
After all, the modern Republican Party, with its current mass exodus to the fringe of the political spectrum, is simply unelectable in the long run. Its hard-line positions on gay marriage and abortion are too theological for a modern America. Its inexplicable reliance on tax cuts and trickle-down theories, almost always beneficial to wealthy people and corporations (or are they both just the same now?), reeks of cronyism. The radicalization of the Republican Party, if it continues at the current rate, will eventually result in self-ostracism and political irrelevancy. But Obama will still lose to Romney if he is incapable of motivating the traditionally low-turnout demographics that fueled his landslide win in 2008.
Rather than the banal “lesser of two evils” campaign philosophy that the Obama campaign seems to have adopted, the president’s campaign should focus its money on reinvigorating a dejected base. The DNC brought a few welcome sparks to the table with its fiery speeches from Massachusetts governor Deval L. Patrick ­'78 and former Michigan governor Jennifer M. Granholm. But the fire won’t catch if the president keeps his silence.
Instead of sheepishly staking his electoral bid on a shaky unemployment rate and praying that the ticking time bomb of the European sovereign debt crisis explodes sometime after November 6, Obama can and should explain the shortcomings of his term. Explain that a watered-down stimulus dulls any effect on the economy, that cutting taxes in the middle of a recession would cripple us further, that extremely profitable corporations paying negative taxes and receiving huge federal subsidies are the true “welfare queens” who are menacing our society. Perhaps he can point out that advocating the accelerated bloating of the military-industrial complex while cutting social welfare and entitlement programs isn’t fiscal conservatism—it’s fiscal hypocrisy. Or Obama can just cross his fingers in the oval office, hoping to eke out another four years.

This year has been a landmark one for achieving gender parity on the Undergraduate Council. Out of 90 candidate declarations, there were 45 male and 45 female declarations. This statistic represents a marked improvement from last year, when female candidates were only 35 percent of declared candidates. Due in part to several gender parity efforts undertaken by the UC and the Harvard College Women’s Center, female representation has doubled in the past two years. Females now represent 42 percent of the winning candidates in 2012, as compared to only 33 percent in 2011 and 23 percent in 2010. The UC is no longer skewed to one gender.
The recent Crimson editorial discussed gender disparity in student government and recommended that female students spend their time and skills more constructively outside an "ineffective" Undergraduate Council. The Crimson's suggestion that women should direct their efforts away from the most significant forum for student advocacy and funding on campus is surprising and misguided. Women's perspectives are invaluable to improving the Council and developing diverse leadership on campus.
The editorial's argument fails to consider that lack of diversity and female representation is a significant cause of persisting inadequacies in College governance. A council is only as good as its representatives, and we need dedicated men and women whose views are reflective of the student body.
Rather than abandoning efforts to reform or reinvigorate the UC, The Crimson should acknowledge strides taken to increase the diversity of UC membership. More female membership on the UC broadens the scope of ideas and leads to improved outcomes for a student body that is now more accurately represented.
In discouraging both men and women to run for elections, The Crimson also ignores successful UC initiatives that resulted in significant pressure on the administration and change at the College. In the past five years alone, UC advocacy resulted in sweeping reform of the Ad Board as well as the creation of five-week winter breaks, the College Events Board, and a new Ethnic Studies secondary field (incidentally, the last was accomplished under Andrea R. Flores, a female president of the UC).
Pre-professional organizations, student government, the sciences, and many on-campus publications need more female members to ameliorate underrepresentation of women. Similarly, female-dominated health and public service organizations would benefit from increased numbers of men in leadership. Real change happens when we step outside the boundaries of sex, gender, or race that society has laid out for us.
At the end of the day, college students must expect to interact with people of all genders in the workplace. Fixing gender disparities in the college sphere will have an impact on who we are and how we interact with others when we leave Harvard.  If we choose not to prioritize gender balance in college student governance, then we cannot expect it to improve after graduation, where it matters much more.
College is meant to inspire us during our years here and help to define our years post graduation. Equal representation not only increases an organization’s effectiveness, but is also an example of what we strive to create.

With Harvard Business School administrators and construction workers looking on, the ceremonial hoisting on Monday morning of the highest steel beam of Tata Hall marked the start of the next phase of construction of the building that will host participants in the school’s Executive Education programs.
At the traditional “topping off” ceremony, attendees were invited to sign the beam, which was then lifted by a crane and set into place by two construction workers atop the structure. Before the ceremony, the building’s construction workers also signed the beam. As part of the celebration, the beam was decorated with an American flag and a small tree intended to serve as a reminder of the environmental impact of new construction.
“I want to give a round of applause to the many men and women whose labor has gotten us to this point today,” Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria said during a speech. “We salute you.”
Tata Hall, which broke ground in December 2011 and is expected to be completed in December 2013, will include 179 new bedrooms and two classrooms, according to Andrew F. O’Brien, the chief of operations at the Business School. The total construction costs are estimated at $100 million.
Situated at the northeast corner of the Business School, Tata Hall will face the Charles River and complete an Executive Education quadrangle. Each year, close to 10,000 students enroll in the school’s Executive Education programs.
At the ceremony, Nohria recognized the work of former dean Jay O. Light in securing a $50 million gift from Ratan N. Tata, the chairman of the Indian industrial conglomerate Tata Group.
“It’s thanks to him, working with Mr. Tata, that we have this opportunity today,” Nohria said.
Tata attended the School of Advanced Management Program, an executive education program at the Business School, in 1975. In his remarks, Nohria spoke of the excitement that Tata, who was unable to attend Monday’s ceremony, has expressed for the project. When Nohria met with him this summer, Tata immediately placed the scale model of the building on a prominent position on his mantelpiece.
“I can’t tell you how proud he felt of this building,” Nohria said. “We thank Mr. Tata for creating this opportunity for us.”
The ceremony also included remarks from Robert C. Murray, the president of Bond Brothers, the construction company in charge of the Tata project. The Everett, Mass. based Bond Brothers has a 60-year history with Harvard, most recently in the construction of the Northwest Building science complex, completed in 2008.
“Harvard is a long-term client of ours...so to be entrusted with a project this significant on the Business School campus is very meaningful to us,” Murray said in an interview after the ceremony. “It really speaks to the long relationship that we’ve had with Harvard.”
William R. Rawn III, the architect of the building who attended the ceremony, said he welcomed the opportunity to design a structure that is “welcoming, accessible, and open.”
Although the final steel beams will soon be in place, the steel workers will continue to do detail work on the building for a few more weeks before other sub-contractors begin the next steps on the building’s construction.
As of April, construction on the project was ahead of schedule due to the mild winter. Still, administrators say that they are planning to meet the original 2013 completion date.
“We’re about 30 percent done, so we still have a lot of the building to do,” O’Brien said.

UPDATED: Sept. 25, 2012, at 12:21 p.m.
Members of the wait staff at the Harvard Faculty Club and Loeb House filed a class action lawsuit in Middlesex County Superior Court last Thursday, alleging that Harvard had failed to distribute proceeds from service charges to the staff, thereby violating the Massachusetts “Tip Law.”
The filing comes just days after the wait staff of the Harvard Club of Boston settled a class action lawsuit, claiming that the Club had violated the same law, for $4 million dollars. The Harvard Club of Boston, a private business, is a separate entity from Harvard University, the named defendant in the Faculty Club and Loeb House workers’ complaint.
According to the complaint, Harvard adds a “surcharge” of around 18 to 22 percent to food and beverage bills. This fee appears to serve as gratuity charge to guests at the Faculty Club and Loeb House, who are told not to tip, the complaint alleges. Harvard uses that surcharge for operating expenses, and even when guests do tip, those funds do not go to the staff, according to the complaint.
Harvard Director of News and Media Relations Kevin Galvin said in an emailed statement to The Crimson that he could not address the lawsuit itself because the University had not yet been served with the complaint. He wrote, however, that Faculty Club employees receive wages that more than double the industry average, as well as benefits including health care, access to child care, paid vacation, and tuition assistance.
Shannon E. Liss-Riordan ’90, an attorney for the workers, said that regardless of the workers’ base pay, any surcharges that guests perceive to be a tip must go to the wait staff.
“The courts have been very, very clear on this,” said Liss-Riordan, who also represented the Harvard Club of Boston workers in their suit. “The law is pretty clear-cut.”
Liss-Riordan said that she has worked on cases like this one for the past ten years and that it is similar to many others brought against employers in the hospitality industry.
She said she was surprised that “there are still employers violating the law.”
Liss-Riordan said that while she does not know how the University will respond to the suit, the tip law makes it clear that the workers should have received the funds in question.
“I think it would be in Harvard’s interest to resolve this quickly,” she said.
Brian Lang, the president of UNITE HERE! Local 26, the union that represents Harvard’s dining service workers, did not return requests for comment.

Before the 9th annual Brian Honan 5k Race in Allston last Sunday, Medha B. Gargeya '14 had never run a race. But when she found out that Harvard would cover the registration fee for the first 100 students to sign up, she decided to make the Honan 5K her first.
What struck Gargeya most about her first race, however, was not the time or the distance. Instead, she said, it was the "supportive" and "enthusiastic" atmosphere surrounding the race.
The Honan 5K was originally founded in memory of Boston city councilman Brian J. Honan, who passed away in 2002  from complications linked to cancer surgery. Proceeds from the race go toward the Brian J. Honan Charitable Fund, which supports a number of causes, including youth education. Massachusetts congressman Kevin G. Honan, the brother of Brian J. Honan, said that this year's race attracted approximately 1,200 runners, the largest number in the race's history.
"I was really touched by the number of people on the sidelines, cheering, and handing out water," Gargeya said. "It was a really warm race, and not just weather wise."
Mythilli Prabhu '13, who was running in the race for the second time, echoed Gargeya's sentiments on the feeling of the race.
"Everone was super friendly, super happy," she said. "It was a great way to start a Sunday morning."
Honan also said the event focused more on creating a connection between people than on the finish times displayed on the clock.
"We're not just about fast runners," he said. "We're about building community spirit and getting people out here for a good cause."
Honan praised Harvard's large showing at the race, noting that Harvard won the Honan Cup, an award given to the school which places the fastest runners in the race.
Christine M. Heenan, vice president of Harvard public affairs and communications, said the race serves as another example of Harvard bonding with the larger area.
“It allows Harvard and the community to come together to support an important cause,” she said.
Craig Rodgers, a councilor at the Bureau of Study Counsel who also participated in the race, said that the event represented a great way for members of Harvard to go out into the community and enjoy a day together. He noted that in addition to the actual race, many groups walked over to the starting line together, and then grabbed lunch afterwards.
“It was a really fun way not just to run a race but to spend some time with friends,” Rodgers said.
Gargeya, who ran the race for fun, said the experience inspired her to run in the next one.
“Next time,” she said, “I’m going to try and break my record.”

A familiar face reappeared in Sullivan Chamber Monday night as Evette Layne, director of the Upward Bound program at MIT, returned to a second consecutive Cambridge City Council meeting to urge the Council to save the MIT-Wellesley program for high school students.
Upward Bound offers high school students a rigorous academic program in a college setting. It was the subject of hot debate at the Council’s last meeting two weeks ago, when students, teachers, and alumni crowded City Hall to offer testimonies in defense of the program.
“The Upward Bound program has not received funding from the federal Department of Education since January 2012,” Layne said, noting that, of the approximately $600,000 needed to sustain the program annually, over $400,000 had once been provided by now-defunct federal grants. The rest, Layne said, has been provided by MIT and Wellesley, who have attempted to sustain the program recently by reducing staff and services.
Vice Mayor E. Denise Simmons, a vocal supporter of the program, urged the Council to discuss ways it could fund Upward Bound at that meeting. She worried that other courses of action considered by the Council, like deferring the matter to a committee for discussion, would not be able to provide a timely enough response. “They were running on gas, and now just about are running on fumes,” Simmons said.
In response to the councillors’ concerns, Mayor Henrietta J. Davis said that, in addition to referring the item to the Government Operations Committee, she would personally visit the superintendent of Cambridge Public Schools on Tuesday to discuss possible funding sources.
“I’m going to hold you to that,” Simmons said.
“You can hold me to that,” Davis responded.
Also in attendance Monday night were members of Service Employees International Union Local 615, a union representing janitors, security officers, and maintenance staff throughout Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire.
Members of the union recently declared themselves ready to strike within the next week if demands on a master contract governing employees of many local companies are not met. Harvard members of SEIU are not affected by the contract at issue and would not strike.
“What we are hearing, it’s unconscionable,” said Councillor Marjorie C. Decker after the union employees spoke. She described the union-suppressing efforts by cleaning companies, many of whom are contracted by major biotechnology firms in Cambridge.
Decker urged firms that would be affected by the strike to review their contracts with cleaning companies to ensure their employees are being treated fairly.
“People don’t think of this happening in Cambridge, Massachusetts,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“What can we do with chocolate?” asked renowned chocolatier Enric Rovira of the audience packed into Science Center C on Monday night. Then he answered his own question. “Do whatever you want,” he said. “Imagination is the limit.”
Rovira's lecture proved just that, as he displayed the versatility of the beloved sweet.
The toothsome talk was part of the public lecture series offered in conjunction with the undergraduate course Science of the Physical Universe 27: “Science and Cooking: From Haute Cuisine to Soft Matter.”
Audience members bobbed to jazzy background music as they viewed chocolate eggs melted with the heat of the sun, planetary chocolates that allow consumers to “pretend to eat the universe,” and a chocolate line called Imagine (after the John Lennon song) that “reflects the cultural diversity of the world.”
Professor David A. Weitz said that for undergraduates, the goal of the course is to make science entertaining—and edible. “If you are not a science major, it is a way to learn about science in a fun and exciting way while still learning serious science,” he said. “Besides, you get to eat your lab.”
The audience members got a little taste too. Rovira entreated the audience to “hold your horses,” but was drowned out by chewing noises as they happily savored roasted cocoa beans, spicy chocolate, and 70 percent dark chocolate.
Rovira, who hails from Barcelona and spoke through a translator, runs a chocolate company that has become almost legendary in Spain. “I came to see him because a Spanish gentleman I met at the last lecture said it would cost $200 to hear him back in Barcelona,” said Harriet T. Provine, a Harvard Medical School associate. “I heard he's something of a god there, so I had to see him.”
The lecture, like the class, focused on integrating the epicurean with the explanatory.
Michael P. Brenner, who teaches the class with Weitz, said, “All of the chefs think very scientifically about what they're doing. Essentially both scientists and chefs are focused on testing ideas in a lab.”
During the lecture, Ingrid Farré, a representative of the Alícia Foundation, an organization that studies the science behind pastry preparation, wowed audience members with her allergen-free creations. Two tasters in the audience called her gluten-free sponge cake “perfection.”
“I'd like you to see the texture,” Rovira said as he picked up his colleague's handiwork and punched it, failing to leave a mark. “It's a very spongy sponge cake.”
Looking further at texture, Rovira drew attention to some melted chocolate that had solidified around the sides of a bowl and called it “a little bit of a disaster.” The “disaster” in question served as a stark contrast to the slideshow Rovira presented of his work.
As the full house of 350 listeners quietly watched the creations before them in awe, Rovira concluded with a humble, “So that’s that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard field hockey team (2-5, 0-2 Ivy) ended its five-game losing streak Monday night, beating Bryant (2-7) and scoring the most goals in a single game this season.
“We definitely were more focused before our game and we came out with a purpose,” sophomore forward Noel Painter said. “We really needed this win. We lost five in a row and we really needed to break that in order to get more momentum going into more Ivy League games.”
Although the final score was 4-1, the game didn’t start out in the Crimson’s favor.
With just 7:55 minutes into the first half, the Bulldogs’ freshman middle Michelle Fallon dribbled into the circle and scored unassisted into the left side of the goal.
“We should be able to bring our type of game, which in the first 10 minutes didn’t happen,” Harvard coach Tjerk van Herwaarden said. “But fortunately that goal woke us up a bit and allowed us to get a little more into our swing and we were able to get the goals back.”
Playing mostly on Bryant’s defensive end, the home team drew three penalties and attempted six shots before one finally went in.
Sophomore midfielder Caitlin Rea ripped a long shot from the top of the circle off of a penalty and scored the Crimson’s first goal of the game at 22:29. Painter assisted on the play.
Three minutes later, senior forward Emma Keller shot the ball and Painter tipped it in for her first goal of the game.
Harvard also outshot the Bulldogs, 19-11.
“We’ve been working on [creating scoring opportunities] for quite a while now,” Herwaarden said. “Today we finally were more controlling over the whole entire game going in forward motion to get enough attacking threat towards the circle while maintaining enough defensive control in our backfield.”
The Crimson maintained its defense with the help of captain goaltender Cynthia Tassopoulous, who saved two crucial shots towards the end of the first half.
In the last three minutes before the whistle blew for half, sophomore forward Kaitlyn Boudah slapped a hard shot past junior forward Rachael Rosenfeld who reverse tipped the ball into the back of the net to seal Harvard’s first half advantage, 3-1.
“It was a team performance and it’s something we have been working hard for in the last couple of weeks,” Herwaarden said. “[I’m] happy for the players, as their hard work is paying off.”
Coming out of the halftime break with energy, Painter chased down a long ball and passed it back to her teammates just before it would have gone out of bounds.
While it didn’t result in a goal, the play helped maintain momentum in Harvard’s favor.
“[Against Penn], we had bursts for five and ten minutes where we played super hard and then we had lags,” Painter said. “We need to keep it up for a full 70 minutes. We did that today and came home with the win.”
After 24:44 of play in the second half, Painter scored her second goal, emerging from a scramble in front of the net.
The ball was sent in by freshman back Elizabeth Jacobson.
Soon after, Bryant forward Rosie Bird found a hole in the Crimson defense and dribbled her way through the circle only to find her shot blocked by a diving Tassopoulous.
Bryant finished the game with two penalties, two shots, while Tassopoulous recorded two more saves.
The game marked Harvard’s fourth win against the Bulldogs in as many seasons.
“We deserve it,” Painter said. “Every practice we’ve been coming out better and better, and we finally got another W on the board.  It feels great.  We can win and we can be winners.”
Harvard hopes to carry this newfound momentum into its upcoming Ivy League matchups.
“I hope that this game will give the team a little more confidence,” Herwaarden said. “We’re heading to Brown next Saturday. This [win] is proving that we are on the right track and developing a system that can work and will create enough attacking flow while maintaining enough defense structure.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although the Harvard men’s golf team found itself in contention after the first round of play at the Windon Memorial in Glencoe, Ill., the Crimson was unable to build any momentum against tough competition in its most recent tournament, finishing 14th out of 15 teams.
Harvard finished with a total score of 934 (+82) for the tournament, which consisted of three rounds occurring Sunday and Monday.
Ohio State ended the weekend in first place, after accumulating an impressive final round score of +5.
The strong finish enabled the Buckeyes to leapfrog over the second place finishers Northwestern, which ended its third round at +15.
While other teams in contention after two rounds finished with scores well over par, Ohio State was able to take advantage of thirteen birdies in the final round to ultimately seal the victory. The Buckeyes finished with an overall score just 29 strokes over par.
Sophomore Akash Mirchandani posted the best score out of all the Harvard golfers, finishing +13 over three rounds of play.
Mirchandani was relatively consistent throughout the tournament, with his best score of +2 coming in the first round and his worst of +6 in the second.
Junior captain Theodore Lederhausen also played solid golf and totaled a final score of +16.
Lederhausen kept his score low by racking up seven birdies over the course of the tournament.
“I was hitting it pretty well, but I hit some costly shots occasionally,” Lederhausen said. “But overall it felt pretty good.”
The Crimson’s third and fourth place scorers—sophomore Seiji Liu and freshman Un Cho—were neck-and-neck for most of the tournament, ultimately finishing with the same score. Both players were +27 in what was Cho’s first collegiate golf tournament.
Harvard’s final competitor, Kevin McCarthy, finished with an individual score of +36.
The Crimson was the only Ivy League team at the Windon Memorial. Schools from across the country made the trip to Illinois, ranging from UC Davis to Indiana to Costal Carolina.
“The field was very strong,” Lederhausen said. “There were a lot of good teams, so we learned from seeing what they were doing.”
After the first round of play, Harvard found itself near the bottom of the leaderboard in 13th place. Mirchandani led the Crimson with a +2 score of 73, and he was closely followed by Lederhausen at +4.
The second round brought about worse results for Harvard, which posted the highest second-round score (310) out of all 15 competing teams, bumping the team down to 14th place, eleven shots ahead of Florida Atlantic.
The Crimson ended the tournament on a slightly better note, accumulating a score of 307 in the third and final round, putting them in 11th place for the day. The course seemed to play harder for all teams during the final round of play.
Consistency was hard to come by for everyone, as only three teams managed to break 300 strokes in every round played, a testament to the difficulty of the course.
“[This tournament] will be a good learning experience in general because the course was really tough,” Lederhausen said. “It really makes you think in a good way.”
Harvard golfers pieced together strings of holes during which they played relatively mistake-free, with pars accompanied by the occasional birdie and bogey.
But every player also went through stretches when consecutive bogeys and double bogeys cost him valuable strokes.
In the end, the Crimson was unable to establish a comfortable rhythm that other schools were able to find.
Day one of play was suspended due to darkness with players midway through the back nine, so second-round play had to be resumed Monday morning.
“It was tough [Sunday] night, as we were finishing in the dark. This morning, we [began] on the hardest hole of the course which kind of showed in our scores,” Lederhausen said. “We didn’t think of it as a problem, but it was definitely kind of tough.”
Harvard looks to bounce back this weekend at the MacDonald Cup in New Haven, Conn., the team’s third tournament in as many weeks.
Other members of the golf team could not be reached by phone because they were midflight.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although not as well known as the offensive skill players they protect—senior quarterback Colton Chapple and senior running back Treavor Scales—the offensive line put together its best game of the season Saturday to lead the Harvard football team (2-0, 1-0 Ivy) to a 45-31 victory over Brown (1-1, 0-1 Ivy).
The line routinely opened up large holes for Scales to run through during his 136 yard, four-touchdown day.
“When the guys up front are opening up holes as wide as an 18-wheeler, it’s phenomenal,” Scales said. “I love those boys to death and they keep doing it for me.”
The line—led by seniors Jack Holuba and John Collins, junior Austin Scheufele, and sophomores Anthony Fabiano and Will Whitman—allowed only one sack on the day and consistently gave Chapple time to throw as he put up 351 yards through the air on 30 completions in 40 attempts.
“The line played extremely well [against Brown],” Crimson coach Tim Murphy said after the game. “A year ago, we had four new starters, including a freshman and two sophomores and now it seems like a luxury to have four of the five starters [back this year]. It was a credit to the offensive line the way we could throw and run the ball tonight.”
After committing six penalties in week one, the line didn’t commit a single one on Saturday. The group enabled Scales to rush for 7.6 yards-a-carry against a defense that only allowed 3.2 yards per rush to Holy Cross the week before.
Holuba and co. helped Harvard rack up 183 total rushing yards against the Bears, nearly double the 92 the Crusaders managed the week before.
“We are one of the hardest working groups around,” Holuba said. “We had a great game plan coming in. You only need to block for a little bit when you have guys like Treavor going and making plays like that—makes us look good.”
The highlight of the afternoon was Scales’ 41-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, when he burst through a hole in the line, made a cut that left a Bear defender diving at his shoestrings, and strolled untouched into the end zone.
That touchdown put the Crimson up 14 points, and Brown never got closer than that during the remainder of the game.
“If my boys get up to the second level, I have to get there,” Scales said. “You want those guys to reap the benefits of the work they put in all week and they put in on that play. It makes it easy on me. I don’t have to do much work at all. I just have to run. They are a heck of a group up there.”
As the game went on, the Harvard line led the offense to more and more success.
After scoring only 17 points in the first half, the Crimson scored 28 points in the second to break the game wide open. Harvard scored four touchdowns in the fourth quarter to turn its narrow seven-point lead after the third quarter into a 21-point advantage when Scales ran in his fourth touchdown of the day with four minutes left.
“We have the ability to run it and throw it and wear down the defense as the game goes on,” Holuba said. “As hard as Treavor hits the holes, he’s bound to bust a big one here or there.”
On another crucial play, the line cleared out a pocket for Chapple and gave him time to deliver a 30-yard strike to sophomore wideout Seitu Smith II, who leaped over Brown’s preseason FCS All-American cornerback AJ Cruz to grab the ball out of the air.
The touchdown put Harvard up 10 and capped a run of seventeen straight points after Brown drove the ball down the field on the opening drive and scored on a one-yard plunge by Spiro Theodhosi.
“We had called a play hoping to get zone coverage, and it turns out they went man,” Chapple said. “Cruz is one of the best corners in this league so to see Seitu go up and take the ball out of the air—that was awesome. Having those types of weapons where you can throw the ball and come down with a thirty-yard touchdown, it’s a huge momentum shift.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Tough weather conditions proved insurmountable for the Harvard sailing team this weekend, which took sixth-place finishes in the Hood Trophy and the Women’s Regis Cup and a 15th-place finish at the St. Mary’s Fall Interconference. Two individual sailors finished 10th and 19th in the NEISA Men’s Singlehanded Championship.
Crimson coach Mike O’Connor acknowledged that the team has a lot of work ahead of it, but he commended the squad’s effort against stiff competition.
“We need to start more consistently, but we showed that we handle shifty conditions well,” O’Connor said. “The level of effort and enthusiasm on the team is very encouraging.”
Freshman Mark Zaleski—who improved upon an 11th-place solo collegiate debut last week with a 10th-place finish this week—says he believes that the team’s makeup of mostly younger sailors provides a unique opportunity for team growth.
“This year we don’t have one person who can really carry the team by themselves,” Zaleski said. “We are just trying to get as much experience as possible in the shortest amount of time. You can already see improvements from earlier on in the season.”
Although the results fell short of Harvard’s hopes, there were many bright moments throughout the weekend, as Crimson boats dominated several races within each regatta.
“We have a lot of room for improvement, but the good moments that we are having show what we are capable of,” senior Jason Michas said. “If we can make those the majority of the regattas, we will do very well this season.”
HOOD TROPHY
Harvard’s co-ed team sailed to a sixth-place finish in the Hood Trophy on Mystic Lake. Tufts hosted the 19-team race, in which sailors faced frequent wind shifts and inconsistent performances.
“It’s a very small body of water with lots of land around it, and that disturbs the wind,” Michas said. “We had very basic things that were going well for us all weekend, but sometimes we would get on the wrong side of a shift and have trouble recovering.”
Junior Alice Kenney and sophomore Gram Slattery overcame a rough start to lead Harvard’s Division A boat to several high-place finishes. The duo ended up in the fourth overall position. In Division B, Michas and junior Alma Lafler had four good races on Sunday morning, but they struggled with their consistency and placed 11th.
Yale got off to a strong start, winning several races to take a 12-point lead. But the Bulldogs could not contend with the wind conditions in the final race, and the regatta-host Jumbos claimed the No. 1 spot.
WOMEN’S REGIS BOWL
The Crimson women’s sailing team sailed on the familiar Charles River this weekend, placing sixth in the 16-team Regis Bowl.
Freshman Sophie Bermudez and sophomore Ashleigh Inglis piloted Harvard’s Division B boat to a fourth place finish. Juniors Caitlin Watson and Jacqueline Cooley raced in the A division for Harvard. The pair had two strong starts, but they struggled to find their footing and finished ninth overall.
After spending the first day in second place, Roger Williams overtook Tufts to win the regatta.
ST. MARY’S FALL INTERCONFERENCE
A group of co-ed sailors traveled to St. Mary’s College of Maryland, where difficult weather conditions on Sunday contributed to a disappointing 15th place finish overall.
The two-day, 18-team regatta had near-perfect weather on Saturday, but on Sunday the temperature dropped nearly 20 degrees and wind shifts were frequent.
In both divisions, the Crimson started slowly and gradually improved throughout the weekend. Junior co-captains Isabel Ruane and Ben Lamont, along with sophomore Michael Drumm, collected 206 points in Division B. Harvard’s Division A boat fared slightly worse, with sophomore Brian Drumm and junior Jacob Bradt racking up 222 points for the weekend.
Roger Williams showed consistency over the two days and variety of weather conditions, finishing first overall with 213 points.
NEISA MEN’S SINGLEHANDED CHAMPIONSHIP
Two Crimson men raced lasers in the Singlehanded Championship at Boston College, where Yale senior Cam Cullman dominated despite strong showings from Brown and Tufts.
Zaleski was in the hunt after the first day, against what O’Connor characterized as very tough competition. He finished in the middle of the pack after Sunday’s races, placing 10th out of 20 sailors. Junior Luke O’Connor finished the weekend in 19th place.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although many Harvard athletes excelled this past week, only one top performer can be The Crimson's Athlete of the Week. (Well, actually this week there were five—but you get the gist). Here are the best of the rest:
BEN ZEPFEL, MEN'S WATER POLO
The freshman led the Crimson in a sweep of weekend games, posting three hat tricks, including a four goal, four steal game against MIT. Harvard won the contest, 13-12, after losing to the Engineers on Sept. 1, 19-17. The team is in the midst of a six-game winning streak—its longest in a decade.
TAYLOR DOCTER, WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL
Against Dartmouth, Docter posted a double-double, tallying 24 kills and 15 digs. The captain outside hitter helped the Crimson get within two match points of a win before succumbing to the Big Green in a disappoint five-set loss, 25-22, 20-25, 22-25, 28-26, 15-10.
COLTON CHAPPLE, FOOTBALL
Senior quarterback Colton Chapple threw for 351 yards on 30-for-40 passing, including a 30-yard gem to Seitu Smith II. The senior also ran for 43 yards, scampering in from six yards out at a crucial juncture early in the fourth quarter to put the No. 24 Crimson up, 31-17, on their way to a 45-31 victory over Brown.
TREAVOR SCALES, FOOTBALL
Scales powered his way to four touchdowns on 18 carries for 138 yards. The four touchdowns were a career high for the senior running back after a career high in rushing yards the week before. Scales has been dominant in the first two games of the season, rushing for over 300 yards and reaching the end zone six times.
JOE FESTA, MEN'S SOCCER
In a match against No. 3 UC Santa Barbara, the freshman goaltender came up big in a 1-0 defeat, posting eight saves, including a dive that left teammates and Santa Barbara fans in disbelief. After allowing a goal in the 14th minute, Festa, shut down the potent offense, which had averaged 3.1 goals per game.
