After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For an industry lauded for its forward-looking creativity, there remains one surprisingly backward aspect of the trillion-dollar world of fashion: race. Though strides have been made in other areas where fashion once lagged, with plus-sized model Crystal Renn and transexual model Lea T achieving widespread recognition, casting directors continue to dismiss and rationalize the lack of racial diversity on runways and in major brand campaigns.
The field has, of course, historically been dominated by white models, but things seemed to be looking up in the ’80s as black icons Iman, Naomi Campbell, and Tyra Banks burst onto the scene and walked for big names like Versace, Chanel, and Fendi. However, as Kate Moss rose to prominence in the early ’90s, the industry as a whole gravitated increasingly toward her translucently pale, waifish aesthetic, effectively shutting the door once again to models of color.
Fast forward a decade: by 2008, controversy had at last begun brewing in the media regarding the near-absence of models of color in mainstream fashion. Vogue Italia responded to the complaints in the form of an “all-black” issue, while Prada recruited wunderkind Jourdan Dunn as its first black model to walk a show since Campbell in 1997. But each institution’s subsequent swift return to a staple of bone-thin, bone-white models made it quickly apparent that the occasional person of color on its runways was accorded that privilege largely out of necessity rather than any genuine desire to diversify. “Tokenism does exist on the runways,” said James Scully, casting director for Tom Ford, Jason Wu, and Lanvin, among other high fashion brands in a recent interview with James Lim for BuzzFeed. “That’s why Calvin Klein will put one black girl in their show every odd season. They do it to not get in trouble, they don’t do it because they believe black women should be on be on their runway.”
Six years down the road, statistics might suggest that the situation has improved. A recent study by Jezebel indicated that the percentage of white models walking in New York Fashion Week has dropped from Fall ’08’s 87 percent to Fall ’14’s 78.69 percent, which, while certainly no revolution, is progress nonetheless. Yet black models remain few and far in between: despite increasing in number in the past few years, fashion’s leading minority continues to hover at a disappointing 9.75% percent of one of the industry’s most high-profile events.
The root cause of the underrepresentation of models of color ultimately appears to lie in the “race-blind” mindset behind the casting decisions that result in majority-white catwalks and advertising campaigns. In a retrospective at the Met in Jan. 2011, fashion journalist Teri Agins asked designer Stephen Burrows for his perspective as the only black designer at the show—only to be interrupted, according to New York Magazine, by fellow host Oscar de la Renta’s vehement assertion that “he was tired of people making distinctions based on skin color” and that we should “[r]emove race from the description altogether.”
De la Renta’s outburst, though seemingly well-intended, paved the way for excuses like those of Barbara Nicoli, who counts industry giants Burberry, Gucci, Armani, and Yves Saint Laurent among her casting clients. Nicoli, in the same article by Lim, said of Frida Giannini, Creative Director of Gucci: “[S]he wants this specific type of girl—no matter the color of the skin…. [But] I think if you’re very strict on your collection and have a vision, it’s pretty difficult to accept someone who is far from your idea of the woman wearing your clothes. It’s all about your beauty ideal, not the color of your skin or race.” This erasure of race allows designers to pass over models of color in the name of aesthetics: a dark-skinned model doesn’t work with our vision, they might say.
But the troubling underlying implication of Nicoli’s statement—and of comments like those that her co-casting director, Leila Annana, made to Lim that “[a] show needs to make you dream, and it doesn’t necessarily need to represent reality”—is that this vision, this dream, is one in which people of color are not present. Those who ignore race in favor of an aesthetic ideal do not imagine a world in which no one sees race (which is problematic in its own right in its undermining of the value of racial identity); they imagine a world in which there is only one race—and that race is white.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was when we were driving through the flats of Ohio, brushing up against Lake Erie, that Sarah said, “Let’s pull over. I remember this place. ”
She didn’t have to tell me—her hands were slick against the steering wheel as she maneuvered the car onto a lip of gravel by the interstate. I took my elbow off the window. Late August bloomed like a rising horizon of dust, grass brittle under the white sky, the asphalt that yawned before us shimmering. What looked like a tree from this distance blinked in and out of view.
Sarah got out of the car. Her flip-flops were soundless against the gravel as she said, “I used to stop here all the time. Both ways.” The closing door punctuated her words.
“There’s a little stream over there—we’ll pass it soon. It’s not really a stream, just a tendril of the lake that dips down south. I’ve always wanted to stop there and put my feet in it and imagine the water had once been at the bottom of the lake or maybe had touched someone’s feet in Buffalo.”
“We should stop there,” I said, and squinted towards where I thought Buffalo might be.
“No.” She shook her head at the lake. “It’ll take too much time, and my mom’s waiting for us.” She turned back to the car. “Let’s go, Rachel.”
When I met Sarah in college, she had already been making the pilgrimage from New York to Minnesota for years, a pendulum between her father, who had found himself a new family after the divorce, and her mother, who had been teaching Chinese literature at the University of Minnesota since Sarah’s birth. I remembered the aftermath of the news that Sarah had decided to move to New Jersey, where she’d been hired by a pharmaceutical company, after graduation. I remembered Sarah’s thinned lips for days, the square set of her shoulders around Jake, whom she would later marry. “She said,” Sarah told me afterwards, her hands tight around the strap of her purse, “It was obvious which parent I’d chosen. She said she was sorry for not having met my standards of being a good parent.”
It had been more than a decade since, though as far as I knew, they’d only spoken a handful of times over the years. Tomorrow there would be something of a reunion, and I would bear witness, like the third party at a contract signing. As Sarah started the engine, I glanced over at her. The same straight, black hair curtained around her ears, the same sweet dimples she used to sink her fingers into when uncontrollably smiling. The years since college had been light on her—a few more wrinkles, maybe, around the eyes, the lips. But the real difference was only evident to me because I had known her so long: a plane of exhaustion underlay every feature of her face, the newly tense column of her neck, the way her hand clawed the gearshift. It was two months to the day that Sarah’s seven-year-old son, Isaac, had died at the hands of a hit-and-run driver.
Jake had arranged the entire funeral, the memorial, the wake. He had met the morticians and ordered the flowers, typical white funerary lilies that grew even paler when contrasted with Isaac’s skin. He had delivered the eulogy while Sarah stood behind him at the podium, head down, the side of her cardigan riding up her left hip.
“Thank you all for coming today.”
Jake was not a natural public speaker. His words fell to the script he’d prepared before him, and he paused too long while staring at Isaac’s first grade classmates, squirming arms and legs swathed in black, hot in the church at late June, uncomprehending as their parents and teachers listened on.
“Isaac would’ve been happy to know how much all of you cared for him,” Jake said. Someone in front of me coughed.
“Today would’ve been the kind of day he liked best: sunny, warm, making people happy. Just like him.”
He adjusted his cufflinks and, lowering his arms, knocked the metal against the podium. It clanged, and people winced. Sarah tugged the hem of his jacket, and his lapels strained suddenly over his chest, gaping at the button like fruit split open. He glanced at her. Then at the pews.
“Isaac was a good kid, even though his,” Jake cleared his throat, “condition made him difficult. But we’d like to thank you, Sarah and me, for your patience and your kindness. Your understanding. Your caring.”
He looked again at the children and parents who had made his son a pariah, the teachers who endlessly protested that someone like Isaac, a child with autism, shouldn’t be allowed in a public school.
“Thank you for making our Isaac’s seven sweet, short years here so good. We hope that he’s happy in heaven now, and that you all will remember what you meant to him.”
He half turned away from us to take Sarah’s hand. We could see his face was mottled with emotion, his sentences nearly breathless with it. He took her hand, and they walked together to the casket where their dark backs stood like two pillars of solidarity.
We in the pews waited, looked on. A few rows in front of me, a little blond head turned and asked, “Mommy, why wasn’t she crying?”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Huntington Theatre Company began its run of “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” a stage play based on the Academy Award-winning movie starring Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn, and Spencer Tracy. The movie was originally released in theaters in 1967 and is heralded as one of the major examples in mainstream America to bring the taboo subject of interracial marriage to public discussion. Joanna Dayton (Meredith Forlenza) returns to her white, liberal family after a year working abroad, only to announce that she is dating her older African American colleague Dr. John Prentice (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) and that the two of them have plans to marry. Her parents Christina Dayton (Julia Duffy) and Matt Dayton (Will Lyman) must then sort out their progressively more complicated relationship with their daughter as well as their own biases against African-Americans in 1960s America. Simply put, the play suffers from thematic inconsistency: from the direction to the performances and even the wardrobe, the show tries and fails to make the production simultaneously a contemporary criticism of racial dynamics in America and a unique cultural product of the ’60s.
The acting falters when the show strays away from being comedic. Even the romance, which is supposed to drive the majority of the plot in the show, feels flat and unbelievable. There’s a moment in the production when Joanna and Prentice play a game of hide-and-go-seek onstage. The entire sequence feels uncomfortable instead of spontaneous and romantic—cloying instead of genuinely emotional. It’s especially disappointing to see Warner fall short of a great performance, considering his top-billed status and how prominently he has been displayed in the show’s promotional material. Perhaps due to his co-star, who stands out as the weakest link in this cast, the relationship between the two characters feels hollow.
Beyond the romance, the drama of the play feels unsatisfying as well due to a lack of emotional conviction. The cast’s inconsistent ability to bring the material to life only emphasizes this shortcoming. In one of the few moving scenes in the play, Matt Dayton rants about his fears about his daughter’s safety if she marries Prentice. Lyman’s performance was intense and passionate as well as emphasized the amount of worry—not anger—that dominates Matt Dayton’s thoughts. In comparison, scenes like when Joanna Dayton confronts her parents about their internalized racism, or when Warner’s father admonishes his son for dating a white woman, feel comparatively stale and flat. Whereas Lyman shows a breadth of complex emotions in a heartfelt monologue, Warner and Forlenza deliver monotonous, dry speeches, making their scenes more often overtly didactic than heartfelt.
There is an inherent challenge to performing and directing this play. On one hand, there is a need to perform it as it was done in 1967, paying homage to the source material. On the other hand, the show also stands as a useful tool for understanding our own contemporary social problems: perhaps shifting the show to a more contemporary tone could have helped make the play much more universal. However, the show did not balance these two directorial choices.
Instead of complementing the source material, the contemporary moments of the production only undermine the significance of rest of the play, which was an obvious product of a different era. The play may be almost 50 years old, but the production should not have made that fact so readily apparent. Instead of making the show seem relevant to today’s racial issues, the modern touches only highlight how removed the show is from the problems of the ’60s. The play presents itself as a product of that time, constantly referencing Nixon and the Vietnam War. Yet the production uses the era as a source of inspiration rather than a grounding, ideological force. The play attempts to de-emphasize the 1960s by furnishing the stage with objects that could come from the decade but also could easily be from any number of decades. Instead of giving the play a well-defined time and place, the environment seems bland and too muted.
“Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” was not offensively bad, but it was decidedly average, both in its performances and its direction, and gave an inconsistent interpretation of a show that is really beginning to show its age.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On the surface, Craig Johnson’s “The Skeleton Twins” is a mess of different things: twins, twin suicide attempts, farting, Halloween costumes, adultery, and scuba diving. The lead actors, Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader, were SNL costars. Yet the mood of the camera inclines to the tragic. It’s a movie whose unconventional range of content and emotions can leave viewers unsure of whether they should be crying, laughing, or straightening diligently in their seats to assume a contemplative pose. The one thing they’ll probably all feel is unsettled—because at its heart this film is really an accomplished, nuanced study of claustrophobia.
The reigning element on-screen is water. Or, more precisely, enclosed bodies of water: pools, tubs, and fishtanks. Adult twins Maggie (Wiig) and Milo (Hader) and Maggie’s pet goldfish spend most of their time submerged in these deceptively transparent containers, echoing those famous aquatic motifs from “The Graduate.” Like pool-bound Benjamin Braddock, the twins are stuck in lives they didn’t want. Milo is a failed actor coming home from L.A., and has just tried committed suicide in a bathtub at the start of the movie. At home, emotionally unstable Maggie appears slightly better off. She’s got a respectable dental hygienist job and the archetypal nice guy husband, Lance (Luke Wilson). She’s so happy with life in their quiet New York town, she’s already cheated twice since marrying Lance and is about to down a load of pills when a call about Milo’s attempt pulls her back up from the deep.
But Maggie will continue to put her head underwater—taking scuba diving lessons, taking things too far with the seductive scuba instructor (Boyd Holbrook), and taking long baths afterward as if to wash off her shame. Correspondingly, Milo will undergo further humiliations and rejections that tempt him again to “check out,” in the twins’ lingo. Not even the illusion of escape granted young Benjamin Braddock is allowed these two in Johnson’s film: both are firmly buckled into middle age. They’re visually subjected to even more claustrophobic conditions than those in “The Graduate.” Almost every shot is uncomfortably zoomed-in on the actors, who are framed in sharp focus against the blurred presence of lights, other people in the background, Northeastern autumn leaves, and, of course, the water. Even waterless settings in cars or bars are similarly cramped for space. The only hope someone can have, in a world this stifling, is the comforting presence of a kindred spirit.
Though Maggie and Milo haven’t talked in 10 years, their unique connection and understanding from childhood make each the only one who can truly help the other now. Wiig and Hader demonstrate exceptional talent in their roles, though there are a couple of moments near the end where Wiig, smashing things in despair, risks melodrama. Together, they truly feel like a brother and sister with an intimate history.
The twins have one indisputably great scene in the film. Milo puts on a dramatic oldies song, Starship’s “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now.” He begins slowly dancing and mouths the words flirtatiously, beckoning with a come-hither motion to Maggie, who is lying on the couch in a rut. Maggie rolls her eyes, but the performance is so amusing, the melody so buoyant and infectious, that little by little she joins in. At the climax of the song—“HEY!”—they are energetically lip-syncing the lyrics, having the time of their lives, karate-style kicking their feet in the air and forgetting their adult anxieties.
What is it about this moment that feels so special, so absolutely magical? Part of it must be the way it pops out of the rest of the movie. In general, Johnson’s work can feel labored. His ichthyological symbolism, growing excessive, will try one’s patience, and the plot structuring can be frustratingly neat. But the film’s overall compositional tightness and bleakness also provide the perfect atmosphere of repression for this kind of scene to joyfully explode. This is one glorious moment of human triumph over restraints. Seeing it can be a vicarious victory for the audience, like watching Rocky run up to the top of the Philadelphia steps.
There are a lot of dissonant notes in “The Skeleton Twins,” but at some point the film, like its troubled characters, does begin to achieve a difficult harmony. Sure, the darkness and the questions will return after Maggie and Milo have finished their lip-sync duet. This is not a world where problems vanish with a cheery song. But something has been broken through for good. Johnson’s film tells how we all hide ourselves, how we drown in ourselves. Then it suggests how, by sharing our burdens in mutual sympathy and good humor, we just may have the chance to keep each other afloat.

I’m walking out of my last class of the day when it happens. Despite the fact that I have already heard it so many times, even here at Harvard, my jaw clenches and I take an involuntary intake of breath.
“Yeah, he was acting so retarded,” she laughs to her friend as they saunter out of the lecture hall.
I was guilty of it too once. Before I spent my summer as a camp counselor for kids with special needs, I would casually use the R-word as well. I’d throw it needlessly and about anything, just as I’ve heard it being thrown around here at school in the past few weeks.
However, after having had the pleasure of getting to know these kids for nine incredible weeks, I can’t hear the word without feeling sick.
I want to chase my classmate down and show her the pictures of the kids I worked with this summer at camp. I want to her to see the girl who was born with cerebral palsy, climbing to the top of the adventure tower all on her own, and describe to her the way—she beamed for the rest of the day afterwards.
I want her to meet the girl who has Down’s syndrome and loved to dance to R. Kelly’s “World’s Greatest.” I want her to listen to the girl who has an inoperable brain tumor that has limited her to a stroller and few motor skills, but who still got on stage to sing The Climb in front of 200 people this summer, flawlessly.
It breaks my heart to think that anyone, much less my own peers at school, would look at these exceptional kids like they are anything less.
What I want most is to show this girl the individuals, the precious human lives, that she is minimizing and degrading by flippantly using this word. While I know this girl meant no harm in her casual statement, any sort of usage of the word propels and enlarges a negative connotation to the entire special needs community.
The thing that is so much more shocking to me is that it is not just this girl that uses the word. I have heard the R-word being used here at Harvard countless times in the past few weeks. I’ve heard it being used in all different ways and all different contexts, from people of all genders, races, and ages.
How is it possible that at for a school so focused on being politically correct, we are so behind the times when it comes to addressing the stigma associated with special needs? Why is it okay to casually use a word that hurts so deeply without a second thought?
I implore the Harvard community to think twice before using the R-word anymore. Advocacy and activism for and by disadvantaged groups have long been parts of the Harvard experience, and it’s time that we extend the same support to those around us living with special needs. Isn’t it time that we pledge to lead the charge in creating a world where youth and adults with special needs no longer have to encounter the questioning stares and insensitive slurs of those that have not taken the time to understand?
As one of the kids at my camp said this summer, “My condition is not a disability. It is a miracle.”
Harvard, it’s time we start acting like it. Let’s spread the word to end the word, which can only happen if we choose to hold each other accountable. If you hear someone say it, kindly ask them to consider choosing a different word. If we refuse to sit back and allow this ugly word to run rampant any longer, we can work towards creating an environment that really does celebrate the qualities that set us apart.
On a campus that sometimes falls short of our respectful and inclusive ideals, I’m calling for a simple but powerful change: Use a different word.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro lacks the charisma and nearly universal name recognition of his predecessor Hugo Chávez, though he clearly shares his former mentor's affinity for bullying and controversy.
Last week, Maduro ordered the attorney general of Venezuela to take legal action against Harvard professor Ricardo Hausmann in light of an opinion piece Hausmann wrote arguing that Venezuela ought to default on its foreign bonds. In the article, Hausmann claimed that the Maduro government has failed to adopt "common-sense policies" which would point in favor of defaulting, but that instead the Maduro government has chosen to "default on 30 million Venezuelans". In response, Maduro called Hausmann a "bandit" and justified pursuing legal action on the grounds that Hausmann "live[s] with money stolen from Venezuela" and is "involved in a campaign to damage our fatherland".
Regardless of whether or not professor Hausmann's economic advice is best for Venezuela, he ought to enjoy the full freedom to make such a claim without redress, especially while residing in the United States. Maduro's threat demonstrates the disrespect for freedom of speech that the Venezuelan government has shown for decades. In spite of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela's constitutional claims to hold "liberty, justice... and the preeminence of human rights" as "superior values", the Chávez and Maduro governments have been woefully deficient in upholding those ideals.
Maduro has failed to maintain the gains in GDP brought on by Chávez's economic policies, though instead of tackle these issues head on, he has opted to scapegoat Hausmann. Further, as Hausmann himself writes in his piece, Maduro also substitutes targeting the sources of his country's economic woes "with measures like closing borders... and fingerprinting shoppers". Perhaps willfully blind to the problems facing his nation, Madura has at least displayed an unwillingness to face them.
Hausmann called Maduro's televised tirade "the despotic diatribe of a tropical thug". Both Maduro's words and his actions show that his arbitrary prejudices and delusions have led him to shun his own people in favor of his ego.
Hausmann is right to be unafraid of Maduro's threats, and if any legal process actually does get mobilized, the United States ought to offer him full protection. Hausmann has said nothing actually libelous and in fact may have suggested a course of action that is best for the Venezuelan people. The country's economic woes are Maduro's responsibility, and Hausmann—a resident of the United States—should have no reason to fear his tactics of intimidation.

Dearest freshmen,
Even though you might have already mapped out the next four years of your lives, rest assured I’m spending this early September evening (well technically morning, but who’s keeping track?) of my senior year trying to figure out which classes to take. I’m also watching a video of a cat in a shark costume ride a Roomba, but that’s neither here nor there. Naturally, I’m looking through various Q guides, trying to find those special classes that garner reviews like “This is the most amazing course I’ve ever taken at Harvard!” or “dayum this TF is hot” or “I loved this class more than Pfister loves pfungi!” The only problem is, I can’t possibly fit all these classes into my schedule. Apparently we have very good-looking section leaders, particularly in the hist and lit department.
The American Presidency. Fiction Writing. Innovation and Entrepreneurship. Introduction to Computer Science. If only I could start my Harvard experience all over again, and take the classes I didn’t make time for the first time around. Because, you know, taking seven courses in a semester is just a little too daunting for me. So is taking five courses a semester, but I digress.
Welcome, freshmen, to the best four years of your life. Unless, you know, the following years are even better. Before you know it, you’ll be stuck dealing with adult problems, like having a spouse, or getting emails that don’t contain gifs. But I will resist the urge to lament about the current state of my inbox, and redirect our joint attention to the issue at hand. Namely, your experience at Harvard.
Freshmen, you today face a choice. Either choose to make the most out of every opportunity in these four short years here, or you resign yourself to Annenberg food for lunch. It’s that simple. Unless Dunster’s new dining hall (formerly the Inn at Harvard, formerly formerly a parking lot, and before that possibly the site of a Revolutionary War pep talk) has dining restrictions, eat there instead. You might think that a columnist at The Crimson, Harvard’s most important and influential newspaper, might have taken the ten seconds to find out whether or not Dunster has dining restrictions. You would be wrong.
And then there’s campus life outside of dining halls. Intramural sports, cultural clubs, a capella groups, all the things you read about in that glossy Yale pamphlet apply here too. There are the late nights drinking and arguing about Social Security and talking about the cute girl in section and debating who’s stuck killing that cockroach in the bathroom. You can’t forget about the countless hours you’ll spend trying to sneak a scorpion bowl at the Kong, or waiting for security to check your bag when you leave the library. (Pro tip: Cabot library has a lower countertop, so you don’t have to lift your bag as high on the way out.)
My point is that there are many things to see, and people to do, in this short timeframe. You’re going to have a great four years, if you decide to. Now I could write a piece about how you can go out and make an impact. And you certainly can. Help develop a vaccine for Ebola, or become a middle school history tutor, or design the next generation of wearable tech. But the important thing to remember is that you don’t have to do any of that. You don’t have to change the world before you turn 22.
Just don’t be afraid to change yourself. Listen to your drunk roommates when they discuss Kant, follow your friends to ballroom dancing or hot yoga (your hist and lit TF just might be there too). Unless you flunk out the first time, you only get one shot at college, that wonderful span of a few short years before you have to deal with flat tires and paying taxes. And how you respond to those problems will tell you who you are, and whether you should take anger management classes or just get a subscription to AAA Roadside Assistance.
So for the next four years, go out and do what you love. Take risks. Do things you’ve never done before. Don’t focus too much on grades. And definitely don’t listen to unsolicited advice from Crimson columns.
It’s going to be a great four years, I’m sure. Here’s looking at you, kid.
Editor’s note: Dunster’s dining hall only allows one guest per Dunster resident for dinner.
Jacob R. Drucker '15, a Crimson editorial writer, is an economics concentrator. His column appears every other Friday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Economics has long had a reputation for intellectual arrogance. But few of economics’ conceits raise the ire of its critics more than Homo economicus, the rationally self-interested actor lurking at the core of mainstream economic theory. Indeed, Homo economicus has become a favorite whipping boy for critics of the dismal science. In taking over this column from the superb stewardship of Jonathan Zhou, I thought it would be appropriate to examine its controversial namesake.
Our subject is a selfish, single-minded creature: her sole concern is the minimization of cost and the maximization of her own utility. Economists assume that she is fully informed at all times, makes no mistakes, and is able to instantaneously make complex optimization decisions.
With these outlandish assumptions, you can probably see why critiques of Homo economicus come from all angles. Economists since Keynes have argued that total rationality and complete knowledge are poor assumptions: real people have limited time to process information and make optimal choices; in most situations, a rough guess is good enough. Psychologists and behavioral economists criticize Homo economicus’s selfish motivations: laboratory experiments have shown that people care about fairness and occasionally even act altruistically.
All of these criticisms have their merits. But here’s a confession: Homo economicus is at most a useful fiction—in economic jargon, a model. Human beings do not actually think like Scrooge McDuck, but, in approximation and in aggregate, we often behave like we do. Just as maps simplify the terrain, economic models shed extraneous detail to focus on the features that are analytically relevant.
This simplification makes complex problems tractable. Consider the humble swai fish sitting on your dining hall plate. The chain of economic relationships necessary that takes this fish from Vietnamese farmers on the Mekong to the HUDS cooks who prepare it is an immense feat of social organization. Starting our analysis by invoking altruism or the behavioral idiosyncrasies of Vietnamese farmers quickly gets us lost in the theoretical weeds. But make the simple assumption of rational self-interest, and the toil and effort that goes into producing those little beige fillets make sense (at least for those who don’t have to eat it). To borrow a phrase, it is not from the benevolence of the swai farmer, the truck driver, or the HUDS dining hall worker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.
The utility of Homo economicus is not limited to money and product markets. One of the major contributions of the Nobel Prize-winning economist Gary Becker, who died earlier this year, was to apply the logic of Homo economicus to the phenomenon of crime. As Becker points out, people commit crimes not necessarily because they are morally deficient, but simply because the benefits of crime outweigh the costs. Society can modulate the level of crime by altering the incentives; for instance, as the probability of conviction increases, Becker’s model predicts that crime will fall. Though simplistic, this model is far superior to the categorical view that all criminals are moral failures. In fact, this analytical tool so often accused of being dehumanizing can serve as a conduit for empathy. It turns out that there may be a bit of Scrooge McDuck in all of us.
The trick with Homo economicus is distinguishing the map from the terrain. Homo economicus is a tool for specific situations, just one page in our analytical guidebook. Invoking her requires a curious mix of both ambition and humility. We must be bold enough to use this imperfect tool to attempt to describe our world, but we must also acknowledge that what we are describing is at best a crude approximation.
It is in this spirit of humble curiosity that I wish to begin this column.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Responding to student feedback, Harvard University Dining Services will now serve a heartier breakfast on Saturday mornings before brunch, according to an email announcement sent out on Thursday.
With this change, Annenberg Hall and all House dining halls will serve what HUDS terms “House-Style” breakfast—items like hard boiled eggs, hot steel-cut oatmeal, and make-your-own waffles—on Saturdays from 7:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. followed by brunch at 11:30 a.m. Previously, all dining halls except for Kirkland served a lighter continental breakfast before brunch on Saturdays.
According to HUDS, the changes were a compromise between students “who expressed a strong preference for Saturday brunch” and “early risers who need a heartier menu than the weekend continental breakfast.”
This adjustment comes just weeks after HUDS introduced major changes to its service and menus, adding new grill items, Saturday brunch, and opening the dining halls between meal times.
This change is effective immediately, starting this Saturday.
Sunday breakfast service will remained unchanged, with continental breakfast available before brunch in Annenberg and all the Houses except for Kirkland, which will continue to serve House-style breakfast.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Drawing on his experiences as a co-founder of Paypal and early stage investor for Facebook, entrepreneur and venture capitalist Peter A. Thiel stressed the role of innovation in entrepreneurship during a conversation with Harvard Business School professor William A. Sahlman on Thursday.
Thiel, who focused on themes from his new book, “Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future,” addressed an audience of MBA students and other members of the Business School community on topics ranging from venture capitalism and social entrepreneurship to higher education and the future of Massive Open Online Courses. The event was hosted by the Business School’s Arthur Rock Center for Entrepreneurship, which facilitates faculty research and student and alumni entrepreneurship within the school.
In his book, Thiel writes that the success of the most renowned entrepreneurs such as Mark E. Zuckerberg or Elon R. Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla Motors, is rooted in their ability to develop and scale radical ideas that oppose the conventional norms of the time.
“Copying others takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. Every time we create something new, we go from 0 to 1,” the book’s website reads. “The act of creation is singular, as is the moment of creation, and the result is something fresh and strange.”
During Thursday’s conversation, Thiel addressed a variety of topics within entrepreneurship, technology, and management. Emphasizing the core thesis of his book, he offered that successful capitalists ought not to seek to compete, but rather ought to seek to form their own distinct, niche markets.
“I think people make way too much of the size of the markets,” he said. “Whereas, if you’re a startup, you have to start with this very small market, and you want to dominate that market fast. Facebook started at Harvard, it was 10,000 people, and it got from 0 to 60 percent market share in 10 days.”
Thiel also addressed the gender and race disparity within Silicon Valley, in which Hispanic and black employees, and particularly females, comprise a low percentage of the workforce. Despite many proposed solutions focused on recruiting more minority and female engineers and executives, Thiel said that more needs to be done to attract female and minority founders.
“I think that the problem really needs to be solved at the founder level. I think that the founder somehow sets the template, sets the culture. I think that the real question that needs to be asked is, ‘How do you get more women founders, more minority founders?’,” he said.
When the conversation shifted to the future of education—particularly, the future of online education—Thiel projected that while many institutions of higher education were threatened by advancements in virtual education, the most competitive universities, such as Harvard, would largely remain secure.
“In this tournament of top schools, you have, supposedly, insurance that they don’t offer anywhere else,” he said. “So I think that MOOCs will be able to replace the other schools, but not these top schools. I think that Harvard is a much safer place than it thinks.”
If Harvard was business and Thiel in control, he said he would capitalize on the University’s brand and expand its geographic reach.
“[Harvard has] a great brand,” he said. “Probably what I would do is to expand that franchise as quickly and broadly as possible.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 19, 2014, at 2:50 p.m.
While BGLTQ activist Aisha C. Moodie-Mills acknowledged that marriage equality is a huge victory for the queer movement, she said in a talk Thursday that in order to attain true equality, priorities in the movement must shift towards recognizing and addressing issues of race and class.
A diverse mix of undergraduate students, graduate students, and Cambridge community members packed into the Barker Center on Thursday to listen to Moodie-Mills’s talk, which addressed how race, class, and sexual orientation intersect.
“[The BGLTQ community is] coming at this from a ‘one percent mindframe,’ and we’re leaving a lot of people behind,” Moodie-Mills said, noting that the queer community is already more diverse than the general population.
Moodie-Mills is currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, a public policy research and advocacy organization with a long history in political campaigns.
Through personal stories of the activism in which she and her wife took part as the “public faces of marriage equality” in Washington, D.C., Moodie-Mills related her gradual realization that marriage equality was only one of the many concerns in the BGLTQ community. She argued that the priorities of young queer people of color are not currently reflected in the mainstream queer movement.
“People of color, they don’t really care about marriage…not that they don’t care, but it’s like the fifth on our priority list,” she said, listing issues such as HIV/AIDs, assault, unfair criminalization, homelessness, and unemployment as more pertinent issues for the black community.
She urged attendees to think of these issues as being intrinsically linked.
“People want to box out. What’s the gay problem? What’s the race problem? You can’t isolate this,” she said.
During the extended question-and-answer section, one female attendee thanked Moodie-Mills for working in politics to broaden the conversation beyond “people who look like her.”
The event launched this year’s Gender and Sexuality Seminar Series, a series of public talks sponsored by various on-campus and off-campus groups including the Office of BGLTQ Student Life, the Committee on Degrees in the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality, GLAAD, and the Open Gate Foundation.
According to Michael Bronski, a professor in the WGS Department and curator for this year’s seminar series, the series is entitled “After Marriage: the Future of LGBTQ Activism” because it is meant to explore issues in the queer community beyond marriage equality.
Bronski described these issues as having “gripped the public imagination” in a previously unparalleled way.
“A lot of the funding of the past ten years—development money—has been targeted towards same-sex marriage,” Bronski said.  “That money could possibly dry up if [the funders] thought getting marriage was the be-all and end-all.”
Bronski said he was thrilled by the large and diverse crowd Moodie-Mills’s opening seminar drew, as this was the first year organizers publicized the seminar series to the local community and worked with outside organizations like GLAD.

UPDATED: Septemeber 19, 2014, at 7:00 p.m.
Ownly, a peer-to-peer beauty network founded by Danni Xie ’13, will launch a pilot program at Harvard in October. The startup, which aims to connect college women in need of cosmetic services to student artists on campus, was chosen as one of six winners in the Harvard College Innovation Challenge in April.
Xie said Ownly will offer a more affordable and convenient alternative to professional salons. She said the startup will enable students to receive these services from their classmates at a fraction of the standard salon price in the comfort of their own dorms.
Xie said she conceived of the concept while talking to her roommate, who was surprised to learn that Xie spent about $20 to have her eyebrows threaded every other week.
“[My roommate told me] ‘I can do that for you. You don’t need to get them done elsewhere,’” Xie recalled.
Xie realized that there was potential to expand these interactions, which occur frequently between friends, to the rest of campus.
“Roommates, blockmates, and friends do each others’ hair or makeup for formals and date events all the time. Ownly is going to make this happen on a larger scale,” she said.
Xie began working on Ownly with web developer David Ding and Dasol Shin ’15 in February. Shin says the team circulated a campus-wide survey to gauge interest in the idea and found it to be high.
“We realized there was a huge demand for affordable service in dorm rooms,” Shin said.
According to Shin, the team has been working on perfecting the Ownly software in preparation for the launch of a pilot program at Harvard.
At the end of October, Harvard students who register as Ownly members will be able to log onto the website to book appointments for a range of services, including hair styling, nail painting, makeup application, eyebrow waxing, and eyebrow threading. With the platform, they will be able to filter offerings by appointment time, distance, and artist rating.
Artists will also be able to upload galleries with images of their work.
Xie says that in addition to saving time and money for students who require these services, Ownly will offer an opportunity for skilled students to earn money doing what they love.
“Artists can choose their own schedule and be paid to do something they enjoy instead of any other part-time job,” Xie said.
Several hundred students have already signed up to receive email notifications when the service is up and running, Xie said.
Helen-Marie Cummings ’17, who frequents a nail salon in Harvard Square, says she would consider using Ownly to have her nails painted.
“If the quality is the same, it’s worth trying for the cheaper price and the ease of having them come to your door,” Cummings said.
Xie says the team’s goal is to eventually extend Ownly nationwide.
“We envision that this platform will save women money on college campuses across the country,” Xie said.

CORRECTION: September 19, 2014
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated David Ding's relationship to Harvard College. In fact, he is not an alumnus. The article also incorrectly stated the role of Dasol Shin ’15 in the startup. In fact, she will aid with Ownly's launch at Harvard but is not a developer. Finally, the article incorreclty stated how frequently Xie paid to have her eyebrows threaded. In fact, it was every other week.

The On-Campus Interview program, which brings employers on campus for full-time job and summer internship interviews, saw a 13 percent drop in sign-ups compared to last year, according to the Office of Career Services.
In order to apply for job positions through the program, students are required to first register through OCS. As registration for the fall term’s OCI program closed on Wednesday night, a total of 5,076 applications were submitted. The number was 5,714 last year.
Deborah A. Carroll, associate director for employer relations and operations at OCS, said she was “not surprised” by the drop in applications this year.
“We’ve been seeing a huge trend where employers are hiring out of their summer internship class. More students are coming back to campus with an offer, so they will do fewer on-campus interviews,” Carroll said, adding that not all students are interested in the fields represented in OCI.
About 200 companies participate in the OCI program each year. Over the past two weeks, many companies have conducted information and networking sessions on campus, including McKinsey & Company, Google, and Oliver Wyman.
According to a booklet published by OCS and The Crimson, 43 percent of the the Class of 2014 participated in the OCI program last year, and 20 percent accepted a job offer through the program.
Finance and consulting are two of the better represented fields in the OCI program. According to Carroll, this can be explained by the fact that big companies in these two fields tend to have predictable hiring need for entry-level positions. On the other hand, the majority of small companies and not-for-profit organizations tend to hire “just in time," since their hiring needs may not be finalized until later in the year.
According to Carroll, this year’s OCI program saw a 31 percent increase in the number of job postings in the technology sector.
“The tech employers are the new aggressive recruiters,” Carroll said. “They are trying to meet lots of students and…they have budgets that allow them to come to campus a lot.”
“We have also seen a huge interest in startups,” she said, adding that OCS will organize a startup career fair in February.
Carroll said that OCS staff reach out to companies in the summer in an effort to diversify the employers participating in the OCI program.
“The hard part is finding out where there are entry-level jobs,” she said. “For example, there are no clear ways to get entry-level jobs at the United Nations.”
Students who are participating in the program said that it is a stressful experience with a demanding schedule, but OCS offers substantial support to help them navigate the process.
Alejandro Perez '15, a Crimson business editor who applied to 29 jobs this year, said recruitment is "a brutal process."
“Everyone is applying, which makes it competitive, so you want to apply more,” he said.
Amy K. Sparrow ’15 said she spends several hours per day on the OCI program.
“It’s like a class,” she said, adding that she found OCS office hours helpful.
Annie E. Arrighi-Allisan ’15 agreed.
“It’s been a little stressful, but OCS does a pretty good job of making you feel supported along the way,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Friends and family of Haley A. Rue ’17, who died this summer while traveling in Germany, packed Memorial Church and Annenberg Hall on Thursday night for an evening in memoriam.
Between verses of scripture, hymns, and remembrances, Rue’s own writing emerged as the focal point of the service. Before her death, Rue spent the summer travelling Europe for Let’s Go, and writing regularly for its blog. She had also posted to a personal blog called “Those Last Five Pounds.”
Standing together at a podium in the church’s nave, members of Rue’s blocking group recited Rue’s recollection of her Harvard admissions interview, during which Rue said she told her alumni interviewer that “if I could do anything with my life, money not being an object, I would be a nomad. I would not cure anything, discover anything, win anything. I would travel and write.”
When Rue was accepted and received a note from her interviewer advising her that “with a Harvard degree, you may very well become the chief of a nomadic peoples,” she recalled being overcome.
“This sentiment overwhelmed me with so much happiness that I cried,” wrote Rue, who was also a Crimson arts editor. “For some reason, I feel like this story explains me. I am pretty weird and often times very boldly so.”
In addition to Rue’s writings, the service touched on the many groups on campus in which she played a central role, from her roommates, blockmates, and entryway mates to her fellow writers from Let’s Go, a Harvard Student Agencies company that produces travel guides. Several of Rue’s friends played musical selections as well.
“From the moment Haley walked into the Let’s Go office, she brought an incredible sense of kindness and love for life that made me want to instantly get to know her better,” said Keyanna Y. Wigglesworth ’16, who worked with Rue at the publication and was flanked at the podium by other Let’s Go writers and editors.
“The reason why we were all so honored to have worked with Haley is because she had such a unique way of bringing people together and of bringing us together. And that’s what she did this summer,” Wigglesworth added.
Later in the service, the tears momentarily subsided when Meg P. Bernhard ’17 introduced a montage of videos Rue had produced with friends as well as photos of Rue throughout her life.
“Haley, as we all know, was silly, generous, glamorous, sparkling, and utterly joyful, and this video captures this beautifully,” Bernhard, a Crimson news editor, said as some in the audience began to laugh knowingly. “In these videos she was, of course, inevitably the star.”
The montage captured Rue from her baby pictures all the way through her valedictory speech at Mount Rainier Lutheran High School in Washington, her freshman year at Harvard, and her travels this summer.
After the montage and before the audience processed with candles to Annenberg Hall to write notes of remembrance, the crowd quieted for brief words from Haley’s father, Warren Starks.
“Haley truly believed in two things that I knew of: her faith and her friendship.... Haley really believed in friendship. Haley loved all of you. Haley loved this University.” Starks said, fighting through tears. “Haley wrote in a letter that when God was ready for her to go, it was the right time. But no time was the right time for me.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 22, 2014, at 2:00 a.m.
Harvard unveiled a new policy to dramatically rework its handling of sexual assault and harassment claims this July, but several weeks into the semester, the office in charge of investigating those cases is still not fully staffed.
Tucked away on the ninth floor of the Smith Campus Center, the new Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution employs just one full-time investigator, William D. McCants, who started at Harvard in August. He’s joined by two assistants and University Title IX Officer Mia Karvonides, who oversees the office, in addition to a handful of office staff.
But the new office, which is solely responsible for investigating the sexual harassment complaints of students from all of Harvard’s schools, is still looking for two full-time investigators to work alongside McCants. Those positions remain vacant at a time when studies suggest students are particularly at risk for sexual assault—the start of freshman year. It is unclear how many, if any, cases have been brought before the office so far.
University officials have called the professional investigators’ role “extremely important and sensitive” and acknowledged that the market for qualified candidates is competitive.
Experts echo that assessment, suggesting that competition from other institutions will prove an obstacle to Harvard as it strives to fill out its staff. Many institutions, like Harvard, are scrambling to hire new personnel as they face federal scrutiny into their adherence to Title IX, the anti-sex discrimination law that governs how universities respond to cases of sexual harassment.
“The demand for qualified operatives significantly exceeds the supply,” said Peter F. Lake '81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law. “It’s a wild hiring market right now.”
Given that hiring market, Lake said, colleges will need to invest significantly to attract qualified investigators. According to recent online job postings for the two vacancies in the ODR, Harvard’s proposed salary range—between $70,000 and $119,900—is lower than what the school is willing to pay a spokesperson for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences or a senior official at Harvard Planning and Project Management.
That salary offer could make it difficult for the University to attract attorneys with sufficient experience to investigate Title IX cases, said Kevin Powers, a partner at the Boston-based employment and civil rights law firm Rodgers, Powers, and Schwartz.
“At this price range, you can get someone who is an employment lawyer, but you’re not going to get someone who’s an experienced employment lawyer, and that’s the difference,” Powers said. “What they really want to do if they’re serious is to pay more.”
In an emailed statement, University spokesperson Jeff Neal defended the posted salary range. Harvard set the pay grade after looking at salaries of those in similar positions at other schools and organizations, he wrote. When asked, Neal did not comment on the challenges the University has faced so far in the hiring process but wrote that the office will make temporary hires to supplement full-time staff if the need arises.
A request for comment from Karvonides, who has not spoken with The Crimson on the record in 2014, went unanswered. Upon arriving to an interview scheduled by McCants’s secretary, a reporter was told by the secretary that the meeting was cancelled and referred to Harvard’s Office of Public Affairs and Communications.
At a town hall-style meeting earlier this month, Karvonides acknowledged that there is a limited supply of professionals in the field.
Questions about the level of qualification Harvard seeks also remain. History professor Alison Frank Johnson, who heads the committee charged with implementing the new policy in FAS, has publicly assured students that she expects highly-trained attorneys to fill the open positions. But the job listing, last updated on Sept. 16, does not require applicants to hold a juris doctorate.
Neal wrote that a J.D. is listed as “highly preferred” in the job posting and not required of applicants so as to allow candidates with “deep” investigatory experience, but not necessarily a law degree, to fill the vacancies. Neal added that McCants, the lead investigator who holds a J.D. from Harvard Law School, will oversee the work of the investigators.
The public posting further stipulates that the appointment will last for two academic years with the potential for renewal, a length that Powers said might cause recruitment problems for Harvard.
“Who’s going to leave a law firm for two years to work for Harvard?” Powers asked. He said that, in his opinion, the ideal contract length would be three to five years.
Even as it has struggled to staff the ODR, Harvard has made other hires to beef up its network of sexual assault support staff since last spring, when the College was hit with a Title IX complaint to be investigated by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights. The staff of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response has since grown two-fold, per the recommendation of the presidential task force led by former University Provost Steven E. Hyman. OSAPR is in the process of hiring a sixth professional, according to Neal.

Harvard undergraduates and faculty members were as divided as the Scottish electorate going into Thursday’s referendum on Scotland’s independence, but, once the votes were counted, those in favor of a unified United Kingdom were left to celebrate.
The referendum, which was mandated after the pro-independence National Party won the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, received worldwide attention after a poll indicated that 51 percent of Scots planned on voting ‘yes’ in the referendum. On campus, that prospect spawned a flurry of op-eds, watch parties, and strong feelings among one of Harvard’s largest populations of international students.
On Thursday night, members of the Harvard British Club, gathered in the Leverett House Senior Common Room, to watch the results roll in. Anti-independence students celebrated with each successive county that voted down the measure.
Those Harvard affiliates voting ‘no’ said they feared Scottish independence would bring economic unrest and destroy the shared historic, political, and cultural connection between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
“I think we are much better with all the resources the UK offers,” said Hannah R. Phillips ’15 of Scotland, whose mother voted for her by proxy. “I think the Nationalist Party would not be good for the people of Scotland. It would exacerbate inequality, and the cost of living would go up.”
Phillips, who worked on the Labor Party campaign in Scotland this summer, said the tensions were high throughout the country.
“It was very heated, dividing families, dividing friend groups,” she said. “It’s the main topic of conversation between people.”
Scottish nationalists at Harvard, on the other hand, who were advocating for the ‘yes’ vote, said they hoped that an independent Scotland would stay out of foreign wars, protect public services, and maintain a government that pays attention solely to Scotland.
“I voted ‘yes,’ but it’s actually not particularly in my self-interest,” said Charlotte L. McKechnie ’15. “My life will not be particularly easy with a ‘yes’ vote, but for me that doesn’t matter. What matters is what Scotland will look like in 100 years, and what this symbolizes: a nation coming together and standing up for itself, and that’s incredible and inspiring.”
Most citizens in the other three countries in the United Kingdom—England, Wales and Northern Ireland—hoped Scotland would reach a ‘no’ vote, and this Cambridge seemed to follow its older sibling.
“I think English people are very confused about why so many Scottish under the age of 35 think that they cannot be both Scottish and British,” said Briton Nicholas J. Bonstow ’17, a Crimson blog editor, who anticipated a ‘yes’ vote. “We in England think we can be English and British.”
Several Harvard faculty members, though divided on the issue, took a more neutral approach when analyzing the vote.
“There are ways in which Scotland will be stronger and will have a huge amount of say in the United Kingdom,” History lecturer Heidi J. Tworek, who is British, said of the prospect of rejecting independence. “There are some grievances that may be seen as justified, but there are ways in which we can accommodate them within the integration.”
Thomas Weber, a fellow at the Center for European Studies and another Briton, agreed.
“The status quo will change anyway because since about a week and a half ago, the leaders the biggest British parties made a commitment to defer the devolution to what’s called devolution max,” he said.

Harvard’s Undergraduate Council has elected 44 new representatives, 16 of whom served on the Council last year.
One hundred three undergraduates competed this year to represent their House or freshman yard on the council. Of the winners, only about 30 percent are women, a sharp decline from last year, when the entire council was nearly evenly split.
According to an email forwarded to The Crimson by UC Vice President Sietse K. Goffard ’15, the UC Election Commission has finalized and confirmed the winners.
Among those re-elected include three members of the UC’s executive committee, Secretary Stephen A. Turban ’17, Finance Committee Chair Leah C. Singer '16, and Student-Faculty Committee Director Happy Yang ’16.
Though executive committee terms, including those of the body’s president and vice president, usually last for the calendar year, the UC constitution mandates that those who have switched Houses during their term must come up for election in the fall. Yang, who did not switch Houses, was mandated to campaign for re-election because she does not lead a standing committee, according to Goffard.
Former UC Parliamentarian Manik R. Kuchroo '16, of Mather House, will return to the Council after resigning from his post last spring. Kuchroo resigned in the face of an internal review focused on his accrued absences from Council meetings; the review was never initiated following his resignation.
Here is a comprehensive list of the Council’s new class of representatives:

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Not many football teams get the chance to play into triple overtime. Scarcely any must endure two in one season.
In 2013, Harvard played just two games that extended past regulation, but both turned into triple overtime games, a taxing task during an Ivy League season that features zero bye weeks.
While both of those matches were emotionally and physically exhausting, the Crimson most of all does not want a repeat of its most recent one that needed three extra periods—a drawn out battle with Princeton that ended in heartbreak. But even though Harvard’s first foray into three overtimes last year ended in victory, it’s still not likely an endeavor it wishes to revisit.
And given everything that’s changed since last season, it shouldn’t have to. The final score of last season’s Holy Cross matchup—41-35, advantage Crimson—certainly made it seem like the contest was an offensive shootout.
With an inexperienced quarterback in Conner Hempel making just his third start behind a battered offensive line, however, it was anything but. Indeed, the only score of the first quarter came off of a recovered fumble and excellent field position for the Crimson.
Following a trend that persisted through Harvard’s first few games of last season, the offense sputtered through the first half before finally picking up steam to survive through extra periods.
“That was the most adversity I think I’ve ever faced in one game,” Hempel said. “I don’t think we had one play where we didn’t have an assignment mistake until the last drive and the overtime drives.”
When Harvard (0-0) opens up its season against Holy Cross (2-1) tonight at Harvard Stadium, the now-senior will again line up under center, this time with an Ancient Eight Championship and a season of play under his belt.
Returning junior running back Paul Stanton and a bevy of talented wideouts, the Crimson’s offensive production should look markedly different from the uncoordinated group of early last season.
Though the Crusaders will be playing their fourth game of the season, Hempel actually views the Crimson’s later start as something of an advantage, as the Harvard squad has already had game-time simulations via scrimmages and should have fresher legs heading into Friday.
“We have had two inter-squad scrimmages and then the Dartmouth scrimmage, so technically, this is game four for us,” Hempel said. “So it’s not like we’re coming out for the first game expecting a bunch of mistakes, we’re coming out for game four, ready to go.”
On the other side of the ball, the Crimson still has questions to answer. Most of this uncertainty lies in the secondary, which returns only captain Norman Hayes.
None of the rest of the defensive backfield has ever been a starter for Harvard, and only a few have had valuable game experience.
This would present less of a problem if the Crimson were playing a rush-happy team, as the front seven hold the bulk of the experience on defense. But Holy Cross’s most dangerous weapon lies in its dual threat quarterback, Peter Pujals.
Just a rookie last year, Pujals was able to pick apart Harvard’s secondary for 345 yards, four touchdowns, and no picks. With another year of experience, Pujals, who also leads the team in rushing, presents potentially an even more difficult challenge to the young and inexperienced secondary.
“You have an idea of what they do offensively, just like they do of us, but when you have really athletic quarterbacks who can sort of distort your defense by doing something else, by improvisation, it’s kind of hard to predict, so it’s hard to defend,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said.
Though the battle with the Crusaders won’t have implications for the Ivy title race, Friday should provide the Crimson with answers to some of the team’s preseason questions.
And if the squad isn’t restless enough after going 300 days without playing for a win, this game has an added element of excitement. “Friday night lights, there’s nothing like it,” junior wideout Andrew Fischer said. “It reminds us all of high school, so we’re ready to come out and do well.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sixteen proved to be the Harvard women’s soccer team’s lucky number in a non-conference victory over the University of New Hampshire.
After taking 15 shots during regulation and the first overtime on Thursday night, the Crimson snapped its two-game scoring drought and losing streak with shot number 16. Nearly two minutes into double overtime, junior midfielder Brooke Dickens hit a game-winning header off a corner from co-captain Meg Casscells-Hamby to lift Harvard (4-2) past the Wildcats (2-6), 1-0.
“We knew that if we kept winning balls in the middle and kept controlling the pace of the game, it would come eventually,” goal-scorer Dickens said. “The effort was there and we knew that we wanted it more than they did.”
Playing in its first ever home night game at Cowell Field, the Wildcats came out with energy. In the first half, the two low-scoring, defensive-minded teams battled for an early lead.
New Hampshire looked like it might strike first when its only goal scorer yet this season, freshman forward Brooke Murphy, got off a shot on goal in the 44th minute. But the play of Crimson senior goalkeeper Cheta Emba kept the game tied at zero.
Emba saved all three shots that came her way in the first half to bring her season saves total to 15.
The Wildcats again threatened early in the second half. In the first minute of the half, New Hampshire’s sophomore midfielder Lilly Radack found an opening and took a shot. Harvard’s sophomore goalkeeper Lizzie Durack, who replaced Emba after halftime, made the save to keep the score level. Durack and Emba combined for their third shutout of the season.
“[Our goalies] have been super solid for us,” co-captain Marie Margolius said. “They play a huge role in helping direct the back line and keeping us defensively strong. It’s really nice to have someone behind us who we all feel super confident in.”
Coming off two shutout losses to Boston College and Colgate this past weekend, the Crimson entered the game hoping to kickstart its offense.
Deeper into the second half, Harvard started to pressure the home team. The visitors outshot the Wildcats 6-5 in the second half, 4-0 in the first period of overtime, and 1-0 in the second.
Midway through the second half, Harvard applied increasing offensive pressure to New Hampshire’s defense. The Crimson controlled possession and took command of the field, firing off four shots in the final 25 minutes of regulation time.
During the first period of overtime, Harvard put together a string of scoring opportunities. In the 92nd minute, sophomore forward Midge Purce connected with a Casscells-Hamby’s cross, but her header bounced off the crossbar.
Dickens followed up with two shots in the 96th and 98th minutes, but Wildcats’ sophomore goalie Mimi Borkan saved them both to keep New Hampshire in the game.
According to Margolius, these close chances “only added to our energy.”
“Going into the game, we wanted to create chances for ourselves and we definitely did it so we were excited about that,” the senior defender said.
The Crimson’s ability to maintain a high level of play at the later stages of this game reflect the team’s fitness and depth, according to Harvard coach Ray Leone.
“We definitely have strong fitness,” Leone said. “We also have a lot of depth on this team so we have a lot of people to go to and were playing a lot of players so that helps as well.”
The Crimson made 14 substitutions during the game, compared to only four made by the Wildcats.
With only one contest remaining before the start of Ivy League competition, Harvard’s ability to breakthrough in this one builds the team’s confidence.
“We want to feel good going into the big-time Ivy League games and this was a good weight off the team’s shoulders,” Leone said. “We are really just concentrating on trying to improve our play and today was just a really good performance the whole way.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard football team starts its season tonight without its top two running backs, junior Paul Stanton and freshman Semar Smith. Both are out with injuries.
Senior Andrew Casten will see the bulk of the carries as the Crimson takes on Holy Cross (2-1) under the lights of Harvard Stadium.
Casten had 151 yards on 40 carries last season. The sidelined Stanton led the team with 936 rushing yards and 17 total touchdowns a year ago.
Smith had risen up the depth chart since arriving on campus before being sidelined. His brother, senior receiver Seitu Smith II, will receive carries due to the injuries.
Seitu Smith ran for 85 yards on 14 carries in the Spring Game, and he and Casten each scored a touchdown in that scrimmage.
“Suffice it to say that Paul Stanton is one of the most explosive running backs and offensive weapons in the Ivy League,” Harvard coach Tim Murphy said. “He’s a guy that obviously we want to get healthy, but we do feel good about the people we have lining up at that position.”

This week, Harvard students woke up to find a slip of paper slid under their doors inviting them “to consider not punching a final club this fall.” This little pink square of paper brings up some interesting—if debatable—points, so let’s break it down:
Exclusivity. Have the authors of these notes seen Harvard’s admissions statistics recently? Railing on exclusivity = throwing stone; Harvard University = glass house.
Gender discrimination. Fair point. I’m not sure that many people would agree that the presence of “female final clubs” on campus makes up for the social weight that the traditional, male-only final clubs have. That said, word on the street is that the male segment of the Class of 2018 would also like the final clubs to be held accountable for discrimination against freshman males.
Lack of transparency. You know what, let’s talk about what really needs to be made more transparent... is it final club or finals club? I don’t think anyone knows, and it made writing this article take like 45 extra seconds. I wrote the phrase “final clubs’” at one point, and it felt ridiculous.
I want to talk about the watermark on these notes. It’s a unicorn. I don’t get that. Does the group that made these notes have a unicorn for a mascot? If so, get me the punchmaster's email STAT, because I need to get in on that.

This summer, Harvard unveiled a new University-wide sexual harassment policy. Administrators are holding town-hall style meetings to talk about the changes, but in case you can’t make it, here’s a rundown of what you need to know.
So exactly what’s different?
This is the first time Harvard has a University-wide policy governing sexual harassment (which includes sexual assault), meaning that it applies to affiliates of all Harvard’s schools. It also establishes a new office, dubbed the Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, to hear and investigate all students’ sexual harassment complaints. This is a pretty big departure from last year, when the Administrative Board investigated undergraduates’ sexual assault cases. Now, any student’s case goes straight to the new central office, which administrators are calling the ODR.
What will the Ad Board do now?
The Ad Board will no longer investigate cases of sexual assault or determine guilt. It will, however, hand down sanctions after the ODR decides whether or not an accused student violated the policy.
Does the new policy include affirmative consent?
The new policy doesn’t include an explicit affirmative consent clause, which would require individuals to actively communicate their agreement to participate in sexual activity (the policy does not define consent at all, which has irked some student leaders and activists). However, Mia Karvonides, the University’s Title IX Officer, has said that Harvard’s definition of sexual harassment covers cases that other schools’ affirmative consent policies do. “The absence of a ‘no’ does not mean a ‘yes’” under the policy, she said earlier this month.
What’s the big take-away?
Harvard just made some drastic changes to the way it handles cases of sexual assault and harassment. But there are still ongoing issues surrounding sexual assault and Title IX here at Harvard. Here’s just one example: This past spring, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights opened an investigation into the College’s adherence to Title IX after students filed a complaint alleging that it’s in violation of the law. That investigation is ongoing.

Good morning Harvard! I’m sure everyone is breathing a sigh of relief that it’s finally Friday. With sections, labs, p-sets, and even midterms (thanks, Ec1010a) in aggressively full force, this week reminded us that school has really begun. And not just school, but everything else too: application deadlines, comp kick-offs, punch season, fall. We’ve seen computer screens displaying Google form after Google form and watched masses of freshmen trek to the IOP, the Crimson, and more. We’ve counted the number of sealed envelopes slipped under our doors, and checked out all the boys in salmon pants and blue blazers anxiously waiting outside the buildings on Mt. Auburn St. We’ve finally started putting away our shorts and tank tops and pulling on our sweaters. In short, it’s been a lot. We hope you have a chance to take a breath and step back from it all this weekend...before doing it all again next week. Yay college!
IN THE ATMOSPHEREAfter a pleasant past few days, tomorrow’s going to get a little chilly, with a high of 58 degrees and a low of 45. In case you didn’t do the math, that’s only 13 degrees above freezing. It’s pretty classic New England to get so cold, so fast, but the best part of it all is that the temperature’s going to swing back up to a sultry 82 degrees on Sunday. So basically, you should leave your room every morning prepared for everything from a beach trip to a rainstorm to a September snowstorm. Good luck.
