After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

A career-night for Christian Juzang. An empowering victory at home.
Coming into Friday, the sophomore point guard’s career-high was 12 points. By the end of the first half in Harvard mens basketball's 66-51 home victory over Princeton, Juzang had eclipsed that mark with 13 points. Adding seven more points in the second frame, the Tarzana, Calif. native received a standing ovation from the Crimson bench when head coach Tommy Amaker subbed his starters out in the final minute. Juzang had played every single minute of action up to that point.
“I thought Christian Juzang was fantastic for us,” Amaker said. “He made some big shots, some end of clock shots. I was just very pleased with how he was able to pick up the slack.”
Juzang’s contributions came both offensively and defensively, particularly with sophomore forwards Seth Towns and Chris Lewis severely restricted in playing time due to foul trouble. Amaker deployed a full-court press throughout much of the contest, with Juzang the lead backcourt defender. The threatening junior guard duo of Devin Cannady and Myles Stephens for the Tigers was held to 15 points combined, half of their typical production output.
Moreover, the Crimson point guard showed an accurate shooting touch from the perimeter. Showcasing a variety of step-back moves, Juzang knocked down 13 points from the field and added seven more from the charity stripe. A 35.2 percent shooter coming into the game, Juzang converted on 60 percent of his field goal attempts against the Tigers.
“Coach always talks about letting the game come to us,” Juzang said. “Shots were just there to take. Just trying to make the play whenever I can, and credit to my teammates and coaching staff for that.”

The high point in the game came when Juzang was supported by two critical bench contributors, sophomore forwards Robert Baker and Henry Welsh, late in the first half. Holding a seven-point lead at the six-minute mark, Welsh snatched the ball on two consecutive defensive possessions— both of which led to made layups on the other end. The second steal was particularly memorable, as Welsh intercepted a pass towards Princeton forward Will Gladson at mid-court before dribbling the length of the court and finishing a euro-step.

“Coach always said deny, deny the bigs at the elbow, and I tried to do that.” Welsh said. “I was just out there, dribbling with the ball, and hoping my layup went in, because otherwise I probably would have been taken out of the game.”
Baker then checked in at the 2:29 mark, immediately making an impact defensively. The Woodstock, Ga, native smothered Tigers freshman guard Ryan Schwieger as he attempted to slam down a dunk along the left baseline. This play preserved a 31-20 lead, and two consecutive jumpers in the final two minutes by Juzang gave the Crimson a 15-point lead heading into intermission.
The 11-3 run to end the half for Harvard in the final six minutes was attributed largely to Princeton’s messy offense. The Tigers turned the ball over four times in that span, adding onto its tally of 12 in the first frame. Leading season scorer Cannady was limited to 1-of-7 shooting, while the team as a whole made just five field goals in a 20 point first half.
While giveaways were the main culprit for Princeton’s lack of offensive rhythm, the Crimson’s one issue in the first frame was foul trouble. Lewis drew his second foul within five minutes of action, while Towns would finish the half holding three fouls. Another issue particularly early on was defensive rebounding, although Harvard regained its composure late in the half to finish with 19 total rebounds.
“We talk so much about our bench and our balance,” Amaker said. “You look at our stat sheet, we had tremendous balance. Henry Welsh off the bench gave us great minutes. Robert Baker had a few plays, a big block, big defensive rebounds.”
Although just attempting three shots from deep the entire game, junior forward Corey Johnson 2-of-3 stat line is another positive sign—particularly given the junior’s early season struggles.
The second frame was more calculated and methodical for the Crimson, especially with Towns and Lewis splitting significant time on the bench. Lewis picked up his third foul on Princeton’s first offensive possession and logged his fourth at the 16:42 mark. Still, Amaker would show confidence in his lead big man, bringing him back into the game at the seven-minute mark.
Despite picking up his fourth foul with more than 15 minutes left in the game, Towns stayed aggressive in his bracketed time on the court and would lead all Harvard scorers with 10 points in the second frame. Towns alongside Johnson and Juzang restricted the Tigers to a 7-of-25 night from three-point range and did not permit any one Princeton shooter from picking up momentum.
Notably, no Tiger finished in double-digits with sophomore forward Richmund Aririguzoh the lead man at nine points. Aririguzoh’s length and aggressiveness offensively allowed him to exploit the Crimson frontcourt with Lewis on the bench. Harvard freshman forward Danilo Djuricic quickly tallied four fouls in Lewis’s absence, while Welsh had three of his own.
However, continued shooting from Juzang and a late drive-in layup over the Princeton frontcourt from Towns was sufficient in closing out the game. The Tigers tried frantically to put up triples, but to no avail. By the final two minutes, coach Mitch Henderson had thrown in the white towel as the team trailed by double figures.

Both Towns and Lewis would foul out leading up to the final two minutes, but strong defense, periodic buckets by Towns before his exit, and offensive responsiveness following defensive lapses were critical in sealing the victory. The Tigers would draw within eight at the 10-minute mark after a wide-open dunk opportunity from Aririguzoh, but Welsh immediately responded offensively, splitting two defenders to maneuver his way into a right-handed layup.
This type of locked-in mentality will be critical for the Crimson heading into Saturday’s Penn matchup, which tips-off earlier than usual at 4 PM. Unlike past weekends, however, Harvard will not have to embark on another trek to reach the basketball court.
“Feels good to be home,” Johnson said. “Having the fans at our back, we like those home gym vibes.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Down in the third period, the Harvard men’s hockey team turned up the heat at Union. But despite the Crimson’s efforts—and the play of junior net-minder Michael Lackey, who kept the Dutchmen at bay—the comeback attempt fell short on Friday night.
The Dutchmen (17-13-1, 12-5-0 ECAC) held off Harvard (10-10-4, 9-6-3) for a 3-1 win, handing the Crimson its fourth loss in five games and sending the team back to .500. As it has in all four of those recent losses, Harvard faced a hot goalie. This time, the masked culprit was reigning ECAC goaltender of the week, junior Jake Kupsky, whose performance (30 SV, .968 SV%) resulted in the Crimson struggling to find an offensive footing for the first two periods of the game.
“We had spurts of good hockey,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “But across the board, [with] all 20 players, I don’t think the commitment level was at the necessary level to win at a tough place like Union.”
With top-line forward Ryan Donato gone for the Winter Olympics, the lines were shuffled in advance of Friday’s matchup. Sophomore forward Ty Pelton-Byce, who has spent the season to this point on the left wing, slotted in at center in Donato’s place. Rookie forward Henry Bowlby, recently back in the fold after dealing with an illness, moved back up to the first line after.
Meanwhile, freshman Ben Solin, who opened the scoring against Dartmouth last weekend, regained a spot among the top 12 forwards after watching last Monday’s Beanpot semifinal loss from the press box. Prior to sitting against Boston University, Solin had found some nice chemistry on the third line alongside tri-captain Jake Horton and junior Michael Floodstrand. Despite all the line shuffling in Donato’s absence, that trio was preserved as Friday night’s second line.
“I think it’s our work ethic,” said Solin last Friday, when asked about his line’s performance of late. “Horton is great at finishing every check, finishing every forecheck. Same with Floody. He’s got some pretty good hands, some pretty good vision. So, I think [we] three work really well together, especially when we’re working hard in the corners.”
Between the pipes, tri-captain Merrick Madsen (7-7-3, 2.20 GAA, .922 SV%) had the night off, presumably saving some energy for the upcoming Beanpot consolation game, leaving Lackey (3-3-1, 2.63 GAA, .906 SV%) with the starting job instead.
“We’ve got to play as a team,” stressed coach Donato when asked how the team could find success without its star forward. “[The Dutchmen] make you compete.... There was a lot of loose pucks there that we wouldn’t get.”
For the seventh time in its last eight games, Harvard did not strike first. Instead, the visitors trailed just 7:40 into the first period after a shot by Union freshman Liam Morgan found its way through traffic—and past Lackey.
Seven minutes later, however, the Crimson retaliated. Kupsky played the puck right onto the stick of Pelton-Byce, who carried it into the slot. Though his stick was lifted on his first shot attempt, Pelton-Byce beat a screened Kupsky with the second try for his second goal in as many games. The teams left the ice for the first intermission tied, 1-1.
“In the first, we were pretty good,” coach Donato said. “But the second period, especially the first ten minutes...we lost all the races to pucks.”
While the Dutchmen didn’t score in those first ten minutes, coach Donato’s team was outchanced despite spending time on the favorable end of a 5-on-4. Harvard has not scored on 16 straight power plays now, a marker of the team’s offensive struggles.
Lackey was forced to be his best in the middle frame, when the Crimson lost the shot battle, 14-8, and made several diving saves. But late in the period, Union found the net again.
With a screened shot very similar to his first goal, Morgan tallied another to break the tie. Barely a minute later, Harvard junior defenseman Jacob Olson was whistled for elbowing, putting the Dutchmen on the man advantage. On the power play, junior forward Ryan Walker swept the puck around Lackey and into the net, widening the home team’s lead.
The final period was the Crimson’s best, as the team outshot Union, 14-5, but Kupsky wouldn’t cave in net and denied all the attempts he faced.
“I don’t put a lot of emphasis on chasing a game and getting some shots in the third,” coach Donato said. “I’d rather have the 3-1 lead and be defending.”
Harvard’s fourth-place position in the ECAC standings remains unchanged by this result, but the gap between it and Union, in third place, widens to three points. The top four conference teams get an automatic ECAC bid and home ice during the tournament, so the two points would have served as a crucial buffer between the Crimson and the eager teams below it.
“At this point in the year...it was our biggest game of the year for us,” coach Donato said. “That’s what’s on the table moving forward for us in all our league games. This game had our full attention.”
For now, Harvard must turn that attention to its Beanpot consolation game against BC on Monday. But the conference play kicks back into gear next weekend, with a homestand against St. Lawrence and Clarkson.
