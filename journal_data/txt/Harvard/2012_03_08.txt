After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I went down to Sanders a few weeks ago to hear Wynton Marsalis’ third lecture. Is the line not outside, my roommate asked as we got closer. Maybe it’s too cold, I said. But when we got inside, the auditorium was just as packed as it had been the past two times. People were standing in the back. We gave him a standing ovation as he walked in.
The lecture was on music at the crossroads, a history of American root music. Marsalis played and talked and led his band through nearly a century of American melodies, detailing the possibilities for inclusion and social justice, and the parallel path of regular American history, mirrored by music. It was a wonderful lecture, studded with perfect gems of playing by the band. I’ve always loved Wynton—I played trumpet since fifth grade when the band teacher convinced me that drums were no fun, all the way to the end of high school, when an assistant band teacher gave me a book of jazz solos; and I played his version of “Caravan” over and over on my desktop computer, his “Autumn Leaves” recording in my head on the subway to school.
I couldn’t help but be disappointed, then, with one part of Mr. Marsalis’ lecture. It was something he did in the past two as well: show no love for the present.
Mr. Marsalis is no luddite. During the Q&A period, he sidestepped a chance to trash iPads and DJs—“The iPad has the potential to bring us together,” he noted. But he didn’t have good things to say about rap: “Rap: what can I tell you. It speaks for itself.” And he suggested that one of the problems with modern music is the fact that it exhibits “less musicianship, more pageantry.”
These are all valid points. He generously acknowledged too that he understands that people might like the music they grew up with, like rap—I do, for instance—and that he’s not making a moral judgment on such people. He suggested that he’d like to make his kids, now in their twenties, share their music with him and listen to his take on it, as long as they would listen to his and hear his words. Then they’d see, he said.
I only wish that he’d let us see, too. Marsalis pulls a careful and interesting particular thread through American history and music, identifying the development of the root music that he loves, demonstrating how it evolved and shaped the culture around it. But he full-stops at the present—even, a few weeks ago at least, in the 1950s. And that seems a waste of his thoughtfulness, talent, and archival knowledge.
We were in Sanders Theatre, with Latin on the walls and dead white men in marble robes watching the stage judiciously from the wings. The audience, while full and enthralled, was a largely adult one, a refined one. At the end of the performance the band bowed, after playing a triumphantly nostalgic tune (one which, in fact, it had played earlier), while people happily clapped. But that’s not what jazz is about—that’s not what jazz sounded like when, immediately afterward, as Marsalis walked toward the wing, his rhythm section came quickly to life, playing a gleeful and unrestrained encore, during which the audience loosened up, during which the energy of a smoky jazz club filled the wood-paneled room.
Instead of ending with Chuck Berry, let’s let Mr. Marsalis talk to us too about Radiohead and the Roots. Let’s let him demonstrate his beliefs and knowledge in a positive, and therefore constructive, sense. Let’s let the hallowed halls of Sanders and Harvard not immediately necessitate a hollow magnetism toward history. I want to hear Mr. Marsalis extend his judgment into the contemporary (and changed) world, in the same way that I want to hear our history professors’ perspectives on the presidential elections, our literature professors’ opinions on the state of writing today. If we end up decrying the present in favor of a remembered past, let us use such remonstrations as a guidepost for the future. Through tracing the side-streets of history, we can propose solutions and advancements for modern music, literature, dance, science, technology and art. Perhaps the past was a better place. Perhaps we do have much to learn. But let’s not ignore modernity. In that way we begin to make ourselves irrelevant.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing day is a very exciting day for some and, regrettably, a very disappointing one for others. There is a pervasive notion on campus that the quality of housing at Harvard varies greatly—that some people make out like kings while others are scorned by the Housing Gods. Yet such an obsession over the minutia of living arrangements belies the undeniably high quality of the majority of Harvard rooms, or even that the quality or location of one’s housing greatly defines most Harvard experiences. The fact of the matter is that housing here is leaps and bounds better than at most universities. Even more importantly, surveys routinely show tremendous satisfaction across all Houses. The quality of one’s Harvard experience is not decided in any large part by the house he or she is placed in.
It’s true that each House has its own quirks—be they Adams’ rats, Winthrop’s lack of tunnels, or the Quad’s distance from the Yard. By and large, however, housing here is great. In many Houses people frequently get singles all three years and in others with less spacious accommodations, residents are compensated by excellent location.  River Run is a great time to appreciate the unique character, perks, and quirks of each House, but when the morning comes and everyone is sorted, it is important to remember that each House is home to a diverse and interesting group of students who have the power to make the next three years of the college experience the best three.
The Quad and the River—too often compared negatively against each other—both have their own distinct advantages. The Quad, for instance, offers a level of tranquility and quiet that many residents thoroughly enjoy. Furthermore, its facilities are modern and its residents frequently get spacious accommodations. Shuttle service is extensive and convenient and offers a nice respite from the cold in winter. The River is charming, beautiful, and wrapped in the historic feel of old Harvard.  The location is unbeatable, and the Yard is not much more than a five-minute walk away.
At the end of the day, it is House spirit that makes for an excellent housing experience. Houses are, above all, communities—microcosms of greater Harvard that offer countless opportunities for friendship, intellectual engagement, and fun. Right now, there exists an unfortunate and inaccurate categorization that places some Houses above others in the minds of freshmen. Regardless of which House knocked on your door this morning, remember that three years of unique, enriching experience await you, regardless of the house you’re in. Forget the Housing Gods, and get ready to have some fun.

An Undesirable Relation
To the editor:
I’m writing in response to the article published in your Feb. 29 issue titled “HEI Loses Princeton Dollars.”
Now that Princeton has joined Yale, Brown, and other leading universities in committing to not reinvest in HEI Hospitality, Harvard’s current relationship to HEI stands out increasingly sharply. I personally am waiting with concern for the Harvard Management Company to finish its review into HEI’s labor practices.  Many other Harvard students, faculty, and staff feel the same way. We already know that the National Labor Relations Board has charged HEI with intimidation and coercive behavior towards its workforce. We already know that HEI’s hotel Embassy Suites has recently been found guilty under California state law of denying employees in physically demanding jobs their legally mandated rest breaks. We already know that multiple HEI hotels are now under boycott at the urging of their own workers.
It only remains to be seen what further information HMC’s review will uncover, and what action the University will then take. Whether this will be a decision not to reinvest, or a stipulation that HEI make substantial changes to conform to a legal and ethical standard consistent with Harvard’s own, I hope that Harvard’s involvement with HEI can be prevented from permanently staining our reputation for fairness and compliance with the law.
Sincerely,
Clio Griffin ’15
Cambridge, Mass.
An Unfair Accusation
To the editor:
Your recent story (HEI Loses Princeton Dollars—02/29/12) is wrong on key facts and unfortunately has misinformed your readers by publishing information from biased sources without appropriate fact checking or editorial balance.
At HEI, we treat our employees with the highest degree of respect and dignity. As the employer of over 5,500 employees at 41 hotels, we strive to comply with all labor laws and regulations. Our employee tenure is nearly double the industry average, and our employee satisfaction scores surpass those of our industry peers. With regard to regulation, the factual data is clear: Of those HEI cases brought before the National Labor Relations Board, the vast majority were deemed to be without any merit or were withdrawn by the claimant. HEI has never been found to be in violation of the National Labor Relations Act.
Our success in growing hotel occupancy rates throughout the economic recession led to an almost 18 percent increased earning potential for employees over the past four years. Additionally, since 2007 the company has invested in the construction of three new hotels in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, and Hollywood that created 757 local jobs and purchased two troubled hotels that preserved another 228 jobs. These investments have created meaningful jobs and fueled economic prosperity throughout the country.
To date, no university has made an investment decision based upon any employment allegations against HEI. Further, the Princeton University Investment president stated that its decision regarding HEI is “based purely on business reasons, and it would be absolutely wrong to infer that PRINCO had concluded that HEI was out of compliance with regulations or industry standards.” To suggest a causal relationship between unsupported allegations from biased parties and university investment decisions is specious and wrong.
The union that The Crimson cites so extensively in its reporting is engaged in a campaign to increase its membership, and its dues, by organizing hotel employees, who are not given the opportunity to vote in a secret ballot election on the decision to organize—the same democratic process endorsed by Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court to elect leaders. HEI welcomes the opportunity to extend this democratic privilege to our employees.
In the future, we encourage The Crimson to provide its readers with accurate information and a balanced perspective rather than republish union propaganda promoting its own financial interest. Our commitment to socially responsible employment practices is clearly highlighted by HEI’s industry-leading employee satisfaction scores. The misinformation contained in this article only serves to harm the very employees that the union purports to defend.
Sincerely,
Nigel Hurst
Senior Vice President, Human Resources
HEI Hospitality, Inc.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Like many of my fellow Harvard students, I have been appalled by several of your recent deeply misinformed comments about liberal arts colleges. In January, for example, you accused President Obama of encouraging kids to attend college because the “indoctrination that occurs in American universities” is how the left holds power in America. You said that Obama’s push for higher education is nothing more than an attempt for the president to “remake” our nation’s youth in his own image. You’ve painted a nightmarish picture of our American universities as “indoctrination mills” run by liberal professors, plagued by an atheistic spirit where students lose their religion due to “politically correct left” professors.
I am writing to tell you that these claims are wild, ignorant exaggerations. Over the course of my few years at Harvard, I have come to discover a wonderful, vibrant campus that values freedom of expression and diverse viewpoints. We are taught to think independently here at Harvard, rather than simply to follow the herd. Heck, our introduction to economics class is even taught by a former advisor to President George W. Bush! Furthermore, contrary to your claim that colleges are bastions of anti-religious sentiment, the center of our campus is the austere and awe-inspiring Memorial Church, which emphasizes the profound contribution of religion to the fabric of the Harvard community.
And furthermore…um…and furthermore…
(…Are they gone? I think they’re gone. Oh, thank God.)
Rick, you’ve got to help me. Everything you’ve been saying about liberal indoctrination? The godlessness? It’s true—all of it. Don’t believe anything they tell you—Harvard’s been keeping me trapped here and brainwashing me.
Oh, sure, everything started off great. Then there were the little things. Like the time that my resident dean caught me reading the Bible and gave me a copy of “Rules for Radicals” instead. Or the time my tutor saw me reading an article from Fox News on my laptop and proceeded to smash my computer while berating me for not remembering that “Red is the new Crimson.” You know, nothing major. I was told to expect college life to be a bit different than high school, so I thought nothing of it.
But then they started mandating these University-wide 7 a.m. salutes to Obama, and Rick, that’s when I really started getting suspicious. Now every day they make us stand outside in the cold now wearing these brown shirts and make us say these meaningless phrases over and over again. “False consciousness.” “Poststructuralism.” “Universal Health Care.” All nonsense. I don’t know how much longer I can take this.
Oh, sure, Harvard’s apologists like to tell people that a church sits at the center of its campus. But have you ever been inside Memorial Church, Rick? All the crucifixes are upside down and there’s a shrine to some guy named Baal at the front of the room. All likenesses of Jesus have been plastered over with photos of Howard Zinn. Hell, I only manage to get exempted from the weekly orgies (also known as “Sunday Services”) because I have asthma problems.
I haven’t eaten real food in months. They don’t allow meat anywhere on this campus. If you so much as bring a piece of chicken within a fifty-foot radius of a Harvard building, they lock you in a human-sized cage and poke you with a stick. “How do you like it, huh?” they say as they poke you. “How do you like it?” I can’t eat any more hemp cereal, Rick, and I’m sick of these vegan turkey legs, too—these people are trying to kill me.  
So they bring up Greg Mankiw? Have you ever actually opened Mankiw’s textbook, Rick? It’s, like, six pages of supply-and-demand charts and the rest is plagiarized directly from the original German version of Das Kapital. It’s a farce, Mr. Santorum. If you even utter the phrase “regressive tax” at Harvard, the administration grabs you and throws you into a cellar underneath Lamont where you’re forced to watch a Paul R. Krugman video on repeat for days on end while Occupy Harvard protesters throw tomatoes at you. Now my friend can’t even say the words “supply-side economics” without vomiting.
I need to wrap this letter up quickly—there’s smoke in my eyes from the Yard bonfire where all the students are burning their draft cards (there isn’t even a draft right now, Rick! What the hell are they burning?!). But this is a desperate plea for help, Mr. Santorum. I need you and all of your supporters to help beat Mitt Romney and take down Obama so that we can stop this madness. Together, we can reclaim liberal arts colleges for the sane few of us remaining in this country. Fight the power! Take back the campus! We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent! We are the 99 percent!
Oh, dear God. It’s…starting…already…

I was looking for a beginning.
I know I was born in New York Hospital on Dec. 22, 1989, but obviously I don’t remember this or any of the things that happened before it. I know my mother was born in Geneva, that she moved to Athens, and then to Rome, when she was a child. I know my father was born in Astoria, Queens. My maternal grandparents were born in Cairo and Istanbul and my paternal grandparents were born in the Bronx and upstate New York.
As New York City immigrant narratives go, my story of origin is typical—made up of tales told so many times in my house, they were supposed to become my own set of memories.
It was July 2011, and I was pretty sad. I had just returned from a summer of thesis research in Italy, having spent most of the time reading or in archives. Though I had a grant, I felt like I had been shipped off by my parents on a grand tour. Maybe they thought that seeing beautiful, old buildings would make me unsad.
It’s pretty normal, at 21, to not know who you are or where you’re going. But this is not about Europe, though it is in a way. This is about Muir Woods.
When one of my closest friends got a job at Google, I told him I would visit him in San Francisco, a place I had never been. It was one of those promises you make late at night in Lamont Library, one you don’t think you’ll be held to, one you don’t know if you can keep. But this one was different somehow because at the end of July I bought a plane ticket to California. It seemed like a big thing to do. There was something about California, about the idea of it, like it was a place whose name required you enunciate all the letters, like you couldn’t say it fast.
My parents have a pretty typical New York attitude about California, which is to say they are skeptical. It represents a liberal bastion they admire, but I have always suspected that they believe it is unnatural in some way. In the 1980s my mother visited California with her first husband. They went to a dinner party, and after the meal everyone got completely naked and plopped into a hot tub. This is the sort of thing that happens in California, she told me. For a while my uncle, my father’s brother, lived in L.A. When my father went to visit him, decades ago, he couldn’t get anywhere because he didn’t know how to drive. My father rode around Los Angeles on a bicycle.
My parents weren’t upset by the idea that I was going to San Francisco to visit a friend, to see a new city, but—even though I had promised it months ago—it felt like an impulsive decision, like I was breaking a rule. So I bought a guidebook for San Francisco. I started planning things to do while my friend was at work. But even before I began researching, I knew I wanted to go to Muir Woods. I wanted to see the trees.
When I got to California, I was happy I had come. I was happy to see my friend. I was happy to discover San Francisco, guidebook in hand. I was happy to see the fog and the ocean and the bay. The first night I was there, I told my friend and his roommates about my desire to go to Muir Woods. I needed them to take me there because I don’t know how to drive, not even a little. On Saturday morning, my friend said he would drive us in a Zipcar. I suppose I had been annoying enough about it.
The whole thing about going to Muir Woods was beautiful. I mean not just the park itself, but the getting there. It was walking up the hills in Noe Valley to get the Zipcar and it was the 16-piece pack of string cheese that we bought. It was the way we measured the length of the Golden Gate Bridge—it is just a minute shorter than “Visions of Johanna.”
And then there was the place, the woods, how you approach them, going around these insane curves speckled with that California—San Francisco, really—fog. We had to park far down the road; we had to walk a long way to get there, but then we got there, and I hadn’t quite expected it but these were the tallest trees I had ever seen.
These trees were not shitting you with how tall they were. It was like a football field, but instead it was a tree. When I was a little girl, maybe in kindergarten or first grade, we learned about the rainforest—not a specific rainforest, more just the concept of rainforest, and part of it was that there are these trees like you wouldn’t believe, trees that create a new level of being, a plane parallel to the ground, where you can just exist. This felt like American rainforest.
I wanted so much to go to Muir Woods, I think, because I wanted to see the oldest thing in America, or something like the oldest thing. Muir Woods was fresh and beautiful, but it was also the oldest thing. It was the instinct of pilgrimage—to journey to a place that approximates a beginning. I needed to believe that there existed a narrative, an arc, and that I was in the place of genesis.
You can’t go to the oldest forest in America and suddenly be unsad. But this is my memory: the happiest I was all summer was then, was when I was just looking up and I couldn’t see any sky, just the trees.

On an especially rainy Wednesday night, Professor James R. Russell sits cross-legged on a Persian rug in his apartment building facing the Charles. “I never sit on chairs,” Russell says. “It’s less formal and I think it’s better for you. That’s what carpets were designed for: sitting more than walking on.”
Russell has lived in this historic apartment, which is approaching 100 years old, since 1993. Born to Jewish parents in Manhattan, N.Y., the Mashtots Professor of Armenian Studies at Harvard has branched out far beyond that city in his 58 years. Though he’s called Cambridge home for the past 19 years, much of Russell’s home is decorated with the products of his visits to Armenia, Israel, Turkey, Iran, Russia, and India.
“Home is a bit like being in the Near East,” he explains, pointing to an Afghan rug he purchased from a refugee during the war against the Soviet Union. His apartment holds a trove of ancient relics and newer acquisitions like these, all collected while he was lecturing throughout the world, each of them with a telling story from Russell’s life. “Your work becomes indistinguishable from your life,” Russell says, referencing the link between the objects within his apartment and his work outside of his home.
The main sitting room is covered with rugs from the various places he’s traveled, and painting supplies are tucked away in the corner, facing a large fireplace. As Russell relates stories of his world travels, he pours Iranian tea—similar to an Earl Grey—from a clay teapot, made by his Israeli cousin while working under a traditional Living Master in Japan, into gold-rimmed Turkish glasses.
Underneath the teapot and glasses lies a century-old metal bread tray from Armenia. “I bought it in an outdoor market and just carried it home,” he explains. “Quite a lot is stuff you find in a flea market,” he says.
The oldest objects he owns are both from Armenia, as well; one is the tooth of a plow, which he found in a lake there, the other, a bronze sword hook engraved with the swirling symbol for infinity. “I can’t swear to it,” he says. “But I think it’s pretty damn old.”
Though much of his home is decorated in relics, Russell attributes equal value to artifacts of more recent making. One of his favorite possessions, he says, is a piston from an automobile company colloquially known as “Stanley Steamers.” The piston, given to him by a colleague, was manufactured in Watertown, Mass. in 1925. “It’s not worth a fortune,” he admitted, “but to me it is.”
Looking around his apartment, Russell places all of his belongings in the same category: “It’s all human artifice and ingenuity.”
This ingenuity is displayed even on his walls, adorned with hangings from the Near East as well as various paintings: some that he purchased during his travels, some made by his partner of 32 years, Dennis, and others painted by Russell himself.
Russell had painted for most of his life, but following a severe motorcycle accident while on his sabbatical in Israel, he became more serious about painting. Russell finds inspiration from menorahs, which serve as muse for his many artistic endeavors, including Hebrew calligraphy and Hebrew prayer illuminations. “You can be infinitely creative with a candlestick,” Russell says.
He recounts his recent purchase of the candle-holders from a large outdoor market in Jerusalem, which sells fresh vegetables, other food, and an infinite supply of other products. “There’s a Georgian there who sells junk, and every time I go there, I look for menorahs,” he says.
Rooted in his Sephardic ancestry, Russell says he would love to live in Jerusalem, as he grew accustomed to the “rhythm of Israeli life” while there on his sabbatical. “I don’t go to places because they’re beautiful,” he said. “I go because of the people.”
Each object in Russell’s brimming collection exhibits the meeting point between another culture and his own: though each is only an object, every one is a reminder of the characters who make his travels worthwhile and who he has incorporated into his life. “You don’t think about these things; you just live among them and play with them.”
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: Jan. 25, 2013
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Armenian Studies professor James R. Russell's place of birth as Brooklyn, N.Y. In fact, he was born in Manhattan, N.Y.

Professor Daniel L. Smail has spent this academic year at the Radcliffe Institute, where he studies what he terms the “medieval world of goods” by sifting through 14th and 15th century household inventories from Marseille, France, and Lucca, Italy. Aside from its quirky subject matter, this project is unique because of its collaborative nature: Smail is working with sophomores Mark S. Krass, Naomi M. Wills, and Matthew Wozny, as well as other graduate and Ph.D. candidates, to collect and interpret his data. FM sat down with the research team to discuss what we can learn from studying the material culture of the past as well as from collaborative and interdisciplinary research.
Fifteen Minutes: What are the benefits of working with students on a project like this when the subject matter isn’t of their personal expertise?
Daniel L. Smail: This is part of the way faculty can take science lab experience and bring it into the humanities. In the humanities there’s never been a custom of having research grants like in the sciences. I would love to have a chance to be able to replicate this experience on a permanent basis. We would move into this world where a significant number of undergrads could really gain research experience in projects like this. It’s modeling research in the humanities that involves group collaboration and pools resources.

Among the many Harvard-related clichés is our lack of dating scene. Dating at Harvard is like a unicorn: you've heard of it, you've read about it, and you’ve probably dreamed about it, but chances are you've never seen it. And there’s probably a reason for that. If you're lucky enough to score one of these mythical "date" things, but quickly discover that the dream turns out to be a nightmare, FM is here to help. Here, we present eight sure-fire ways to get yourself out of this predicament. Fast.
1. The Classic Approach
Get one of your friends to give you a call half an hour into the date with an "emergency." If you are an iPhone owner, consider yourself lucky and make use of the various fake call apps available. UHS is a great name to drop during this phone conversation. Norovirus is another key term. If you are really desperate, take the exaggerated route and put an imaginary best friend in an imaginary car accident. You'll need to go big in order to go home.
2. The Alcoholic Approach
If you're of age and find yourself at a locale that provides liquor, make the bad date worth your while and order a drink—or five. Everyone, including you, gets more interesting after a couple of shots. Who knows, maybe after two rounds of Venus in Furs at Upstairs on the Square, you might actually discover your ability to juggle silverware. Nothing says free entertainment like a drunk girl who juggles.
3. The Dining Hall Approach
Plenty of "dates" at Harvard happen in dining halls. The easiest way to get out of these is to stage a reunion with your blockmates, linkmates, or those random acquaintances you haven't spoken to since freshman year, and have them crash the event: the more, the less painful.
4. The Caffeine Approach
Since Lamont Café seems to be the social center of Harvard, especially during freshman year and exam season, you may find yourself on a bad date here. If this is the case, march right over to the counter and order four espresso shots, citing "midterms" as the reason. Take these in front of your date at lightning speed, and wait patiently until you start shaking like a washing machine and your date starts scurrying toward the door.
5. The T Approach
If the date takes place near the T (think Pinkberry, Starbucks, or Au Bon Pain), slap yourself on the forehead and exclaim that you have forgotten about a "thing" you needed to do in Boston. Hop on the T and get off at Park Street. The beautiful landscape of Boston can wash off the scarring memory of any bad date.
6. The Political Approach
The great thing about Harvard is that people are really passionate about things. The great thing about that is that it is very easy to drive people crazy with opposing views. If your date is a vegetarian member of PETA, casually reveal that you own multiple fur coats and that your bag is made out of stingray leather. Watch them turn purple and rush out the door before you finish that red velvet cupcake.
7. The Crazy Approach
Start talking about your troubled relationship with your mother, your trust issues, and your low self-esteem. Randomly burst into tears. If you can't cry on cue, the least you can do is frown, crinkle your forehead, or fake a few facial spasms to scare your date off.
8. The Shopping Approach
Suggest that your date join you for a quick walk down Brattle Street and stop at American Apparel to pick up some things. If you are a guy on a date with a straight girl, make a beeline for the neon-colored clothing rack and say, "You know, lately, I have been really into neon colors and sequins." If you are a girl on a date with a straight guy, pick out something that is ridiculously oversized, and comment, "You know, I have a really good feeling that this is the year I become a mother."

This winter may have been warm, but that isn’t carte blanche to be dressing out of season. A skirt fluttering in the breeze might have been a good look for Marilyn, but baring everything south of the border in the weather of the Great White North is pushing it beyond the realm of the acceptable.
Have you never questioned why the other Great White North, namely the blinding white of men's thighs, rarely sees the light of day?
Just as the cold does no favors for the men in the room, the common cold you'll likely contract will eliminate your potential suitors before your legs even enter the equation. Bared legs are the realm of people like Heidi Klum, Jennifer Aniston, and the Harvard Hoochies—the tanned, the wealthy, and the desperate.
Now, we're not going to judge you for baring all if your interviewer is a morally questionable possessor of a Y chromosome, and if your diploma contains the letters "B" and "U," but if you're a self-respecting, upstanding heir to the Harvard-Radcliffe legacy, just pull on some tights. They may not be pants—we mean this, tights are affirmatively not pants—but at least you're preserving your dignity. Besides, done right, nobody has to know. It'll be our little secret.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While much of the student body revels in Housing Day celebrations on Thursday, some students will sit out the festivities, stuck in classrooms racking their brains during a midterm. Many students said they feel that having these tests interferes with their ability to soak up the spectacle of Housing Day.
“I think it’s unfair because it’s stressful to take a midterm on Housing Day and I don’t really get a chance to celebrate Housing Day and be excited about my new House,” said Jenny S. Shi ’15, who has a midterm on Thursday.
For some, having a midterm encroaches not only on Thursday’s celebrations, but on Wednesday night traditions as well.
“I’m not doing River Run so I can study and get some sleep,” said Louise E. Decoppet ’15. “I have a midterm at 9 a.m., so I don’t even know if I’ll get my House assignment.”
Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris said he sympathizes with students who feel they are missing out on Housing Day fun, but that school must always come first.
“As a former House Master I am well aware of how special Housing Day is for students, and how important it can be to building community in the Houses,” Harris wrote in an email. “But, as with all social activities, Housing Day festivities must take a back seat to academics.”
Government professor Ryan D. Enos, whose course Government 1372: “Political Psychology” has a midterm on Thursday, said he felt that there was no reason Housing Day should not be a day of instruction like other school days.
“By indicating that a midterm should not be given on Housing Day, you are asking ‘why are you forcing students to show up to class and take a midterm?’ meaning otherwise they wouldn’t come to class,” he wrote in an email to The Crimson. “If Housing Day is going to be treated as a holiday, then we should make it a holiday, otherwise we have to keep learning and teaching on the days that have been scheduled.”
Still, some students say they refuse to let a midterm keep them from carrying on the tradition of reveling at River Houses the night before finding out their Housing fate.
“I’m not drinking, but other kids will be hung over tomorrow because they’re going to participate in River Run no matter what,” said Kiko A. Porte ’15.
Some students said they wondered why Housing Day coincided with one of the busiest paper and midterm weeks of the semester.
According to Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67, Housing Day was originally scheduled for the week before spring break to distance it from the date later in the semester that freshman used to have to declare their concentrations. The administration, according to Dingman, was trying to avoid having two such important emotional stressors so close to each other.
But though concentration declarations shifted to sophomore fall several years ago, the timing of Housing Day has remained in the mid-spring due to tradition.
Romance Languages and Literatures Senior Preceptor Elvira G. DiFabio said she wished Housing Day had been noted on the academic calendar early on, so she could have avoided scheduling a test that day.
“I didn’t know about it at the beginning of the year, and when I found out about it a few days ago, it was too late to change,” she said.
Some other professors and teaching fellows have been sympathetic to students who are heavily involved in House events on Thursday—for example, Winthrop House Committee Co-Chair Marissa C. Friedman ’14  was able to take a French exam earlier in the week so she could help run Housing Day.
Since matters are out of their hands both in terms of Housing results and midterm dates, many freshmen said they are just going to roll with the punches.
“I think it’s inconvenient, but at the same time, I’m just going to deal with it, because shit happens,” said Jalem D. Towler ’15.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Black political organizers should seek to address their causes to minorities of many ethnicities rather than focus only on the black community, Harvard professor William Julius Wilson argued during a panel discussion on black politics.
Wilson, a University Professor, said that public dialogue which emphasizes economic and social problems that affect broad swaths of society will ultimately strengthen the foundation of black mobilization.
The panel, held on Wednesday night at Brattle Theatre, also featured University of Chicago political science professor Michael C. Dawson and Reverend Eugene F. Rivers III ’83.The panelists discussed how the black community should organize in the 21st century.
Dawson pointed out that just as the black community needs supporters of other ethnicities, multiracial efforts must reach out to black leaders.
“A prerequisite for multiracial involvement,” Dawson said, “is first getting the participation of black people.”
Wilson and Dawson both said that a current tendency to present the black community’s problems as a matter of race alone is not conducive to successfully achieving black political goals.
“If leaders in the African-American community see these problems separate from those facing all Americans, they will be less likely to join other groups seeking economic and social reform,” Wilson said. “What I would like to see is black leaders join with other progressive groups and come up with the kind of legislation that would improve the conditions of many Americans.”
Wilson, who teaches African and African American Studies 115: “HBO’s The Wire and Its Contribution to Understanding Urban Inequality,” also commented on the transformation of America’s densely populated neighborhoods to abandoned zones, as depicted in the television series he teaches about.
“Inner-city neighborhoods suffer from a lack of social organization,” Wilson said. “They suffer from incredible joblessness—which fosters increased drug use and the breakup of families.”
The panelists also discussed President Barack Obama’s leadership, stressing what they deemed the overall success of his administration’s push for public charter schools despite charges that the schools are ineffective.
“Obama has gotten a lot of criticism because public charter schools challenge institutional entrenchment,” Wilson argued. “If you look at the charter schools of Boston and New York, they are incredibly successful. And these are schools that are made up predominately of underprivileged African Americans.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The majority of Harvard students may not live on campus—or even come from America—by the time the University turns 400 according to a vision proposed at a panel organized by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in Tsai Auditorium Wednesday afternoon.
“I want to begin by welcoming the Harvard class of [20]40,” began Maya Jasanoff, a history professor and the moderator of the event.
She continued in the voice of someone telling these future students what Harvard looked like in their “past”—today’s present. “Back then Widener Library was full of books. People checked them out; these were heavy chunky things,” she said. “Classes used to be held mostly between 10 and 4, the time you now spend on internships and labs and start-ups.”
Jasanoff’s thought-experiment set the tone for Wednesday’s discussion—the second and final in a FAS series entitled “The Future of the Present: Faculty Imagine the FAS at 400.”
She and four colleagues talked about the challenges and opportunities facing Harvard as it navigates an educational landscape increasingly transformed by digital forces—from virtual learning through online classrooms and Skype seminars to instant information access via Twitter and Wikipedia.
In defense of the physical university campus, government professor Claudine Gay argued that conducting education through virtual mediums alone will rob students of key interactions that can only occur spontaneously and in-person.
“Discovery is not possible without dialogue,” she said, citing chance five-minute conversations after class and encounters in the Yard. “This shared physical space...and how these spaces are configured—all of that can foster the kind of community that really creates opportunities for dialogue.”
Gay said she worried that with information so much more readily available, students were becoming less resourceful.
“My nostalgia for the present is going to mark me as something of a Luddite,” she said. “The Widener experience, literally browsing, and kind of seeing where that takes you—it’s part of a wholly different approach to data collection.”
Gay was not alone in her concerns about a newly digital future.
Robert J. Wood, an electrical engineering professor on the panel, cautioned against “a potential de-emphasis on hands-on learning” due to digital tools.
The panel’s attendees said they appreciated the perspectives offered by the professors.
“I’ve been a little concerned and worried about what the next few years—with all of these technological enhancements and advances that we have—might be taking away from that experience for students and for educators,” said Tara Benedict, a senior program director in the Office of the University Marshal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While every other team that has earned a bid to the NCAA Tournament this year did so drenched in sweat on the court, members of the Harvard men’s basketball team won a ticket to the Big Dance from the comfort of their own dorms on Tuesday.
The Ivy League is the only conference that does not have a postseason tournament, which meant Tuesday’s matchup between Princeton and Penn would determine who would represent the conference in the NCAA tournament. If the Tigers won, the Crimson would return to the Big Dance for the first time since 1946. A Quaker victory would mean a one-game playoff between Penn and Harvard for the Ivy crown.
That meant Crimson enthusiasts were forced to root for Princeton, the same team whose last-second victory shot last March crushed the team’s tournament dreams. But all of that was forgotten when the buzzer sounded the end of a 62-52 win by Ian Hummer and co. over Penn. The Crimson had won the Ivy title outright. It was going dancing.
“It’s very ironic that we were rooting for Princeton this game,” junior Brandyn Curry said. “I actually forgive them for hitting that shot against us last year.”
Curry chose not to go through the ups and downs of watching the game from afar. Instead of watching the team’s fate play out on his computer or television, Curry opted to relax by playing video games with junior Dee Giger, his teammate and roommate.
Downstairs, junior Christian Webster couldn’t turn away from the action as he watched the game in Currier’s basement with two teammates, freshman Wes Saunders and sophomore Matt Brown.
“In the first half, when [Princeton] went up, I was really excited, but I was like, ‘Nah, it’s just the first half,’” Webster said. “Then in the second half, [Penn] started coming back, and I was getting a little nervous. With three minutes left I was jumping up and down, saying, ‘They are going to win, they are going to win,’ and my teammates were trying to get me to calm down. It was ridiculous. It was crazy.”
After the game, the team joined together for the first time as champions.
“We are all so close. Even after watching it separately, we all ended up in the same room celebrating and jumping up and down,” Webster said.
The moment was particularly special for co-captain Oliver McNally, who has helped lift the Harvard program from the cellar of the Ivy League to national prominence.
“For the last 24 hours, I’ve just been thinking about where I was when I was a senior in high school...I had already committed and the team was 8-22 and I was like, ‘Man, we’ve got a lot of work to do,’” McNally said. “To be here with a 26-4 record, an Ivy League championship, and hopefully a favorable ranking in the tournament and to be getting a lot of coverage, it’s crazy.”
The remarkable turnaround wasn’t lost on coach Tommy Amaker.
“The journey has been rewarding, and in some ways, it’s happened fairly quick,” Amaker said. “If you think of how far we’ve come and the success that has evolved and developed, we are very happy and thrilled about where we are and excited about where this thing may go.”
Now, McNally has taken it upon himself to get the team to look forward as it prepares to face their first round opponents.
“It will be my responsibility to make sure this team is ready to go and be focused in practice over the next week.”
The bracket will be announced live on CBS on Sunday, and Harvard will retake the floor on the following Thursday or Friday.
Looking ahead to next week, Webster said he still thinks this team has plenty of fight in it.
“I’m very excited to see who we match up with,” Webster said. "Depending on who we match up with, we think we can make some more news.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an effort to respond to what one hospital executive termed a “primary care crisis,” two Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals will shift their pay structure so that doctors are paid in part based on the number of patients they treat and the complexity of those patients’ conditions.
About ten percent of doctors’ salaries at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital will be allocated based on the size of their practices, rather than the two percent based on practice size at MGH last year.
The new pay policy springs from an increasing demand for primary care, according to Joseph P. Frolkis, vice chair of primary care at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.
Frolkis said in an email that as baby boomers age, the population has become older and sicker, requiring more time and attention from doctors.
In addition, he said that the roughly 32 million new patients who have acquired health insurance under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 have put further strain on hospitals.
Now, Frolkis said, there is a growing gap as demand for doctors’ services outpaces the number of primary care practitioners.
The new compensation model is meant to plug that gap by spurring doctors to take on new patients.
Eric M. Weil, associate medical director for primary care at MGH, said that the new payment scheme should also better reflect physicians’ work.
“Much of primary care is conducted outside of face-to-face interaction with the patient and is spent on coordination for health coverage,” Weil said. “This was not reflected in the previous compensation model.”
Frolkis said that the former system led some doctors to stop taking new patients entirely.
“In a traditional primary care setting, physicians can feel out-of-control,” he wrote. “In this context, they can be de-motivated to take on new patients—who may take more time and can be labor intensive, especially given the number of elderly individuals seeking care.”
The compensation change, Folkis added, “allows physicians to feel that they can take on new patients, and give them the attention they deserve.”
Weil, who helped create the new model at MGH, noted that now, “having more complicated patients should mean the doctor gets more compensation.”
But Weil acknowledged that calculating the complexity of primary care in order to determine doctors’ salaries may prove challenging.
“It’s too early to tell what effect this will have, but we’re optimistic,” Weil said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Course websites and House tutors could become new weapons in Harvard’s fight against academic dishonesty if ideas discussed at Wednesday’s Committee on Undergraduate Education meeting are turned into policy.
At the meeting, CUE members—including top College administrators and several students—also debated whether secondary fields and citations distract from focused academic study of a single subject.
In contrast with last month’s meeting, in which committee members engaged in heated debate over the Add/Drop deadline and midterm grade feedback, administrators struck a more philosophical tone in their discussion Wednesday.
In the meeting, Director of the Program in General Education Stephanie H. Kenen offered two suggestions to discourage academic dishonesty: the addition of texts on each course website outlining that class’s collaboration policy, and an initiative to train House tutors “to be a little more expert on citation practices in their fields” to help students avoid plagiarism.
Kenen added that she and her colleagues are trying to approach the problem by “starting to lay the groundwork for change in the culture.”
She added, “We often know from Ad Board cases that it’s at two o’clock in the morning when the student has not slept and is feeling a lot of pressure that they make a really stupid judgment because either they don’t know how to cite or whether they should cite.”
Samuel F. Himel ’12, the chair of the Undergraduate Council’s Education Committee, told The Crimson after the meeting that he was skeptical of Kenen’s proposal to help alleviate academic dishonesty by training House tutors, calling the idea “a little bit shortsighted.”
Himel said, “We’re not talking about misattributed quotes here.... People cheat when they feel helpless, when they’ve got their backs up against the wall—by no means is [training tutors] going to make that go away.”
College administrators have had an eye on reevaluating Harvard’s academic integrity policy in the past year.
In Feb. 2011, the College conducted an online academic integrity survey to collect data on students’ experiences with academic dishonesty.
But last October, Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris told The Crimson that only 27 percent of students responded to the survey, providing insufficient data to recommend any new approach.
Currently, a Committee on Academic Integrity is meeting regularly to review possible next steps, including the creation of an honor code.
In a second proposal, former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis ’68 expressed concern that the range of academic options such as secondary fields and citations “results in students getting too distracted by doing too many different things.”
Lewis added, “There are too few incentives for people to do the kind of deep concentrated work from which they will learn the most and from which they will never again have the opportunity to benefit.”
At the Faculty of Arts and Sciences meeting the day before, however, faculty members expressed nearly the opposite objection to expanding access to secondary fields: that too many secondary fields would not leave students enough room in their schedules to explore a wide variety of electives.
Kenen defended secondary fields, saying that the program was developed in part “to provide a more feasible option for many students who tried to pursue joint concentrations with fields that did not fit together well.”
Himel also questioned Lewis’ claim, saying he does not think students who pursue secondary fields or citations are necessarily too distracted to delve deeply into their concentration.
“People who want to do focused work have always done focused work,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Trailblazing female alumnae who served as leaders in their undergraduate days engaged in a panel discussion with current female campus leaders for an event that was sponsored by the Women’s Initiative in Leadership at the Institute of Politics.
“This is the first year that we assembled a panel of former women leaders from student organizations as well as the present women who fill those roles,” said Victoria E. Wenger ’14, the student chair of the Women’s Initiative in Leadership.
The panel, which was part of Women’s Week 2012 and was moderated by journalist and IOP Fellow Farai N. Chideya ’90, focused on the perspective of the women who had been some of the first female leaders on campus, and asked the current female leaders to discuss the progress that had been made since that time.
“My class was the first class to have ‘fresh-women’ in the Yard—and it was a successful experiment,” said Nancy J. Sinsabaugh ’76, a higher education consultant who served as the first woman chair of the IOP Student Advisory Committee.
“There have been huge changes in Harvard in the past 30 years,” she added. “When I was a undergraduate, it would have never occurred to me that there would be a woman president of Harvard.”
Susan D. Chira ’80, assistant managing editor for news at the New York Times and the second female president of The Harvard Crimson, noted that while gender issues still persisted during her time at the College, she felt enormous possibilities and freedom as a woman.
“My undergraduate experience was in some ways more of a gender-free zone than after I got out of college and encountered the residual issues in the real world,” said Chira.
Current female leaders at the panel, who commented on the increased opportunities for female leaders on campus over the past few decades while noting a few areas for potential improvements, included Harvard Student Agencies Vice President Elizabeth F. Shuman ’12, Crimson Managing Editor Julie M. Zauzmer ’13, and IOP President Jenny Ye ’13.
One organization that has advanced but still lacks gender parity, Wenger noted, is the Harvard Undergraduate Council, which regularly features more male than female leaders.
On the topic of life balance, most panelists advised being ambitious and not worrying about choosing a “family-friendly” career path. They noted that such an attitude can actually lead to increased flexibility and job satisfaction.
“Don’t clip your wings too soon,” said Chira. “Don’t decide that this career path will be easier in ten years ... Stay open to the fact that when [you] need to attend to the personal parts of your life, it doesn’t doom your trajectory.”
Lynne L. O’Connor ’82, the first female president of Harvard Student Agencies, noted that she did not regret taking extended leave or reducing her consulting load when she started her family.
“There was definitely some backlash from that [when] I made that trade off,” said O’Connor, the current Senior Director for Client and Brand Strategy at Vistaprint, referring to reactions from senior male partners and other colleagues. “It did slow my path to partner and was frustrating at times, but in hindsight, with a daughter in college and a son in high school ... I don’t regret that decision.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When President John F. Kennedy received his housing assignment, there was nobody in a lion suit to greet him at his Weld dorm room.
But this morning, new residents of Winthrop, along with the other 11 Harvard Houses, were met by cheers from House residents eager to welcome their new members.
Although House life has come to be seen as a defining part of the Harvard experience, the actual traditions of Housing Day, when all freshmen are placed in their future homes, are less than a decade old.
THE CREATION OF A HOLIDAY
When Judith S. Palfrey ’67 and John “Sean” G. Palfrey ’67 took the helm of Adams in 1999, Housing Day Eve was the more popular event, but only for a group of renegade House residents who participated in an unsanctioned race, called a “glorious competition,” to be the first to snatch the list of new freshmen assigned to their House.
Once upperclassmen got ahold of the information, they awoke their future housemates in the early morning, beating by hours the official letters from the administration, Sean Palfrey recalls.
But soon after, the College began to crack down on these late night adventures, promising to punish residents caught possessing the list or waking up freshmen. “The college wanted to regiment the way things were done,” Palfrey says.
Over the next five years, Palfrey says, Housing Day would become “progressively less and less interesting.”
In 2008, Associate Dean of Student Life Joshua G. McIntosh worked with House Committees to make Housing Day more fun for students.
Since then, House Committee members and upperclassmen have been responsible for “dorm storming”—delivering the letters that tell blocking groups where they will live for the next three years. At lunch, Houses commandeer tables in Annenberg to pass out t-shirts and swag to their newest members. The festivities continue well into the evening, with House-sponsored dinners, ice cream socials, and happy hours.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 says that new traditions like Housing Day dinners and welcome events are meant to encourage enthusiasm among even the most disappointed freshmen.
“Over time we said, ‘Let’s get a real welcome,’” Dingman says. “The welcome has developed into something that I think makes people that are assigned to a place they didn’t think they would enjoy feel, ‘It’s going to work out.’”
AN OFFICIAL WELCOME
On Thursday evening, new Meese, crowned in gifts of antler headbands, will enjoy a bonfire and s’mores in the Dunster House courtyard. Down the river, future Winthropians can gather at a special Stein Club with a performance by Harvard’s own Motown and Soul band, The Nostalgics. And at the other end of campus, students assigned to Cabot will partake in a special community dinner.
Over the past few years, the efforts of House Masters and House Committees to reach out to new members of the community have become increasingly institutionalized.
“It makes people realize how lucky we are to have a warm, supportive, encouraging environment,” Dunster HoCo Co-chair Alissa N. Changala ’13 says of Housing Day traditions.
On the night of Housing Day, most Houses hold a dinner where freshmen can explore their new dining hall and a reception where they will be able to meet the House Masters.
During Cabot’s Housing Day dinner, House Master Rakesh Khurana says he likes to tell freshmen about the House’s storied past.
“We want to give people a sense of its rich history,” he says. “It is an invitation for people to join a community that will support their academic development, their connections with each other, and intense caring for their well-being.”
Many Houses create official welcome packets and goody bags for freshmen.
Each year, new Cabotians receive a an item that symbolizes the House and its fish mascot, something Khurana calls a “totem.”
In the past, Khurana says students have received Cabot key chains and ID card holders with the Cabot logo, along with goody bags filled with Swedish Fish.
“There is an intense amount of Cabot and Quad love,” he adds.
THE TWELVE DAYS OF HOUSING DAY
While House Masters have become increasingly involved in Housing Day activities, student anticipation of the event has stretched the holiday spirit of the event to the weeks and days before the last Thursday before spring break.
Many attribute the advent of inter-House spirit competitions to Mather’s 2008 email to the freshmen class with an attached video “Mather House: The Movie.” Over the past four years, this first video has sparked Houses across campus to produce YouTube videos touting the advantages of their respective homes.
In the past month, students have released a variety of videos: music videos including Mather’s “Call Me Mather,” movie spoofs such as Quincy’s  “Q-Men: Freshman Class,” and plays on internet memes like Pfoho’s “Sh*t River People Say.” Mather leads the Houses in this year’s battle of the videos, with 6,304 views on YouTube as of Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. Pfoho’s video comes in second with 5,256 views, followed by Quincy’s take on X-Men, which had 4,423.
And the gorillas, penguins, and polar bears have been spotted beyond the small screen, as students—and professors—clad in mascot suits have dropped in on large lecture classes this week.
On Monday, the Cabot House fish surprised students with a visit to Economics 10, and Mather’s Gorilla was spotted in Societies of the World 14: “The British Empire.”On Wednesday, Pforzheimer House Master Nicholas A. Christakis delivered his lecture for Sociology 190: “Life and Death in the U.S.: Medicine and Disease in Social Context” in a polar bear suit.
However, administrators say that some student celebrations—especially the Housing Day Eve River Run—take things too far.
Palfrey says that, in particular, the traditions of burning boats and praying to the river gods was “excessively celebratory.”
But administrators say they do not want to stifle the enthusiasm of students in their crackdowns.
As an alternative to River Run, the First Year Social Committee hosted a black light party in Annenberg, which included shirt decorating and a live DJ, according to an email from Dingman to the freshman class.
Changala adds that Dunster offered alternatives to River Run on the night before Housing Day.
“We do encourage them to come to the House the night before and meet people, but our House Masters are very keen on keeping people safe,” she says.
Palfrey also says he hopes that Housing Day can be a positive celebration for the community.
“Housing Day should be one of the great annual celebrations,” he says. “We should continue to enable it to continue being students’ favorite day.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
History Professor Lizabeth Cohen has been selected as Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, the University announced Thursday. Cohen, who currently serves as the acting dean of the Institute, previously served as the chair of Harvard’s history department and Director of the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History.
“In my eight months as interim dean, I have learned how much the institute has to offer—advancing the research of Harvard faculty and students, providing intellectual invigoration to our interdisciplinary fellows, sustaining the world’s preeminent research library on the history of women, and pursuing programs to share this wealth of new knowledge with wider audiences close to home and increasingly around the world,” said Cohen in a statement.
In a statement, University President Drew G. Faust, who served as the Dean of Radcliffe prior to ascending to the presidency, praised Cohen’s academic prowess and leadership abilities.
“Liz Cohen is a distinguished and imaginative scholar with a deep knowledge of Radcliffe and Harvard and a strong dedication to Radcliffe’s pursuit of new ideas and collaborations across the academic disciplines, the professions, and the creative arts,” said Faust in a statement. “[A]s interim dean she has already strengthened Radcliffe’s ties to people and programs across Harvard and beyond.”
Radcliffe, which maintains a focus on the study of women and gender, is an interdisciplinary institute that fosters academic studies in a number of different fields.
“The Radcliffe Institute was my first Harvard home,” Faust said a statement. “I know from experience what an important role it has to play [both] within and beyond the University.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Housing Day is filled with the hype of which house is the best house.  But whether it be quad or river, it doesn't really matter what house  you're in, right? All that matters is who wears the house the best.   Here is a list of athletes who make their houses shine.
Adams—Nick Jordan, Heavyweight Crew
This season, Jordan contributed to the team's undefeated season with  his spot on the varsity boat, including a victory over Yale. The boat  also scored second place at the IRA National Championship.
Quincy—Ari Farag, Squash; Mel Baskind, Soccer and Lacrosse
This had to be a tie. Farag automatically earns a place with his  recent national championship in squash, while Baskind is a captain of  the soccer and lacrosse team. She was voted Ivy League Player of the  Year this past season in soccer and was named first-team All Ivy League  in lacrosse.
Lowell—Andrew Campbell, Lightweight Crew
Even though Campbell is taking the semester off, he still gets this  one.  He was named 2011 US Rowing Man of the Year due to his uncontested  victories in competitions such as the US U23 World Championship Trials  and Elite Nationals.
Leverett—Walter Peppelman, Wrestling
He served as wrestling captain this season as a junior and took  second at the EIWA championships. He currently is seeded fourth in NCAA  Championship tournament, one of three on the team who received an  automatic bid.
Dunster—Alex Killorn, Ice Hockey
The assistant captain of the hockey team was elected to the All-Ivy  first team this season. Not only that, but he was named ECAC Player of  the Week November 29 and January 31. A contributing factor to this may  be his 18 season goals, placing him fourth in the ECAC conference.
Mather—Rebecca Nadler, Skiing
This skier earned first place in a race for the first time in  Harvard’s history with her performance at the Eastern Intercollegiate  Ski Association carnival event. The win made her the first skier in the  Crimson’s record book to win an EISA event.
Winthrop —Jeff Reynolds, Baseball
Last season, the second baseman was named first-team All Ivy and led  the team with a .301 batting average. This season, he has already been  projected to be first-team All Ivy in preseason.
Kirkland—Christine Clark, Basketball
This sophomore has already made a mark on the Crimson's basketball  team. She's been named to the Ivy League Honor Roll in addition to tying  her career high of 28 points this season. Not only did she reach this  mark, but she also averaged 22.5 points per game, which convinced  CollegeSportsMadness to name her Ivy League Player of the Week.
Eliot—Taylor Docter, Volleyball
A current captain-elect, Docter led the team and was placed eighth in  the Ivy League with 3.05 kills per set and posted a season-high 18  kills. Her constant solid performances led to her be named to the  second-team All Ivy League in addition to her Academic All-Ivy honors.
Cabot—James O'Connor, Heavyweight Crew
O'Connor also contributed to the dual season victories for the crew  team. Rowing in the varsity boat, he helped the team clinch a win for  the Ivy League title and Eastern title. Plus there's still that IRA  National Championship second-place he can brag about.
Currier—Brandyn Curry, Basketball
You can watch a sample of Curry's performances this season over  Spring Break during the March Madness tournament, but here is a quick  summary: he currently has 421 career assists, which places him in sixth  in the Crimson record book. Averaging eight points per conference game,  Curry has started in every game this season, which CollegeSportsMadness  seems to have called early, as they named him preseason second-team All  Ivy League.
Pfohorzheimer—Josue Ortiz, Football
Although Ortiz just graduated, he still brought Pfoho pride as he  proved to be an important factor this past football season.  He earned  the Ivy League Defensive Player of the Week after his stellar  performance against Penn, ensuring Harvard's Ivy League title. During  that game, Ortiz racked up 10 tackles whilst forcing a fumble and  recovering one to help the team seal an important victory. He also  finished the season with Defensive Most Valuable Player honors.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As we prepare for the Housing Day festivities, I thought I would take the time to determine which house is the most athletic. With really no valid way of accomplishing this, I turned to gocrimson.com stalking and decided to make a huge table tallying the number of varsity athletes in each house.
After the tallying was complete, Dunster came out victorious with a total number of 84 athletes affiliated with the house. I must admit that this is a rough estimate, since gocrimson fails to report the house for a number of sophomores, but there is another reason why Dunster comes out on top: its dining hall.
While it's true that Dunster has a lovely dining hall with real napkins and a spacious servery, the real reason it stands out is that it is open an entire 30 minutes later than every other dining hall. As a member of the track team, it is a fantastic feeling of relief after I walk out of Palmer Dixon, swear to myself as I look at the clock, and then realize I am actually going to make HUDS dinner since Dunster will be open.
The Dunster dining hall has spared me who-knows-how-much money after long, tough preseason practices. And what makes it better is that the grill also stays open longer for that extra protein after a lifting session. The funny thing is that if Harvard Hoochies were to walk into the Dunster dining hall at 7:30 P.M., they would probably faint at the sight of all of the athletes there. It's a different atmosphere at that time; practice bags are everywhere, teams sit by table like a high school cafeteria, and there are sports discussions to boot.
Even if Dunster didn't have the highest number of athletes, the dining hall would make up the difference because the number of athletes it brings in on a nightly basis definitely earns Dunster the title.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard University Boat Club’s senior class has been making it look easy for a while, but no one who knows the sport is falling for it. Rowing is considered to be a sport of attrition. By a class’s senior year, the story goes, the team of walk-ons will have just as many walk-offs. Apparently the Crimson heavyweights didn’t get that memo. The vast majority of the team’s original freshman class has stuck around for all four years, and as a fellow senior rower I can’t help but appreciate the determination of each and every member of that class, from the 1V standouts to the team’s 2F alumni.
But while it’s impressive, Harvard’s high return rate shouldn’t be considered especially surprising because it was clear pretty early on that this group was going to be something special.
The class had plenty of standouts who would earn success immediately in the first freshman eight. They came to Newell Boathouse having already earned national championships while competing for their high schools in both the United States and Great Britain. They’d represented junior national teams for the United States, Great Britain, and New Zealand. That eight didn’t waste time picking up speed and went undefeated in the dual season. When a talented Brown crew deprived the boat its Eastern Sprints title, the nine of them bounced back to take silver at the IRA National Championships.
It didn’t take long for the 1F athletes to make their impact known on the varsity level. Five of them—captain Mike DiSanto, Pat Lapage, Nick Jordan, Sam O’Connor, and Matt Edstein—earned seats in the varsity eight the following year with Lapage taking the prestigious stroke seat. That varsity eight would go on to complete the elusive “Sprints-Henley Double” with the Sprints victory avenging a dual season loss against—you guessed it—Brown. While O’Connor missed the following season with a dislocated shoulder, the other four won a second-straight Eastern Sprints title and took silver at the IRA National Championships. O’Connor would rejoin Edstein and Lapage in the 1V for its Championship Eight Head of the Charles victory.
Meanwhile, Elihu Reynolds has become a 2V stalwart and has a Sprints Championship and two IRA medals in tow.
“When our class first met Elihu, we thought he was a coach,” DiSanto said. “Everyone on the team loves him. He always comes down with a great attitude.”
Reynolds earned his second IRA medal, a silver at the 2011 championships, while rowing alongside former 1F teammate Jack Morrissey.
“Jack is probably one of the funniest guys on the team,” DiSanto said. “He’s quite the rower as well. He's really turned it one this year...I think he looks out for some of the sophomores."
Coxswain Alex Sopko, a Crimson sports editor, coxed Harvard’s second boat all fall and led the Crimson B four to a runner-up finish at the Tail of the Charles where it finished only 1.7 seconds behind the winning A four.
“She’s always someone you can talk to,” DiSanto said. “She puts such a positive spin on things. She’s like a caring mother figure.”
That’s the 1F’s story. Joining them at every step of the way has been a group of committed rowers who took bronze medals at Eastern Sprints as members of the 2009 second freshman eight. Some of them, such as Dave Paresky and Ed Winters-Ronaldson were successful high school rowers, while two, Andy Stein and Andrew Hamm, were in their first year rowing.
“As we’ve gotten older, they’ve been bigger contributors on the water,” DiSanto said. "They make the locker room fun. They bring a team dynamic to Newell...it's fun to be rowing with those guys, and it's fun to be around those guys."
Those rowers would go on to earn success in both the third and fourth varsity eights, and Stein would join the 1F alumni for a race at the Head of the Oklahoma.
Ultimately, it’s not the story of two boats but of a remarkably cohesive senior class and the kind of dynamic it has created.
“Our class made the boathouse fun,” DiSanto said. “Everyone’s focusing on what they need to do but at the same time having a good time.”
Whether in the locker room or on the race course, the senior class has been a model of work ethic, consistency, and team unity. And that’s been equally true at the 1V and 4V levels.
“It’s been a lot of fun being captain [but] to be completely honest, I don’t have to do too much because this team is so motivated and self-driven,” DiSanto said. “We have a pretty incredible senior class.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
If character reveals itself in the face of adversity, this Saturday afternoon may prove to be the first gut check in a young season for the Harvard men’s lacrosse team. The Crimson, which dropped a 7-6 decision to No. 19 Hofstra last Saturday, will look to bounce back as it travels to Washington, D.C. to face off against the Big East’s Georgetown Hoyas.
The contest is a decisive one for Harvard (2-1). A win would send the team into next Tuesday’s matchup at perennial-power Duke with a 3-1 record and a chance to turn heads nationally, while a defeat would put it at risk of entering Ivy League play with a sub-.500 record if things go poorly against the Blue Devils.
Georgetown (1-1), which has finished in the middle of the pack in recent years in what is arguably the nation’s strongest lacrosse conference, is coming off of a 12-7 victory over Detroit Mercy last Saturday. The Hoyas, who qualified for the NCAA tournament in eleven consecutive seasons prior to 2007 but have failed to do so since, fell to No. 4 Maryland, 16-11, in their only other contest of the year.
“Georgetown is a very talented, well-coached team,” Crimson coach Chris Wocjik said. “They present challenges all over the field.”
The Hoyas’ attack, which was clicking on all cylinders in last season’s 16-15 Harvard victory in Cambridge, is headed this year by junior attackman Travis Comeau, a Big East preseason first-team selection who leads the team with six goals over two games. Fellow Big East first-teamer Zack Angel, a senior midfielder, isn’t far behind after tallying five early-season goals.
But the Georgetown attack has been forced to retool after losing the 2011 leading-scorer Davey Emala, who transferred to North Carolina, and assist-leader Ricky Mirabito, who graduated. Plugging those holes are unproven commodities: redshirt sophomore Zac Guy is returning from what was a season-ending wrist injury, while junior Jason McFadden has recently made the transition to attack.
“They get up and down the field, and they push the tempo,” Crimson co-captain Kevin Vaughan said. “They play a similar style to us.”
The Hoyas welcome a few new faces to a defense which was average last season, allowing just over ten goals per contest. Junior Patrick Murray and graduate student Bobby Boyle anchor the back line, while Matt Winter and C.T. Fisher have split time in net and allowed a combined 23 goals thus far.
With such a small sample size to study this season, Harvard, says Wocjik, isn’t entirely sure what to expect from Georgetown on Saturday.
“They are very athletic,” Wocjik said. “I expect them to come out with a strong game plan. Last year was a high-scoring game, but both teams are playing a little different this year, so we don’t necessarily expect that.”
But the lack of information on Georgetown isn’t necessarily a bad thing for a Harvard team that has turned its focus inward after a frustrating loss to Hofstra last weekend.
“We’re very disappointed in losing [on] Saturday,” Wocjik said. “The important thing is we learn from it. We’ve got a long season ahead of us and our goal is to get better and apply what we’ve learned.”
The main aspect missing in last Saturday’s loss was an offensive spark—the Crimson held the Pride to just seven goals but could only muster six of its own. Senior attackman Jeff Cohen tallied a hat trick on three unassisted goals, but the offense lacked the rhythm it had achieved in Harvard’s first two contests, in which it scored 11 and 14 goals, respectively, while getting off over 40 shots in each game.
Part of Harvard’s lackluster offensive performance, says Vaughan, can be attributed to Hofstra’s willingness to sit on the ball and slow the tempo after jumping out to an early lead.
“Hofstra took away a lot of what we like to do,” Vaughan said. “The main thing we learned is that we have to play better settled offense, and we have to take care of the ball when the transition opportunities aren’t necessarily there. We have to be better at slowing the game down when we need to and dictating the tempo on our own terms.”
The Crimson will look to the usual suspects to step up against the Hoyas: Vaughan has tallied five goals from the midfield through three games, sophomore attackman Daniel Eipp has scored six while adding a team-best 4 assists, and Cohen’s ten early-season goals put him on pace for one of the best scoring seasons in Harvard history.
“Right now, we’re focused on Georgetown,” Wocjik said. “That’s really it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I have a confession to make.
In the final minutes of Tuesday night’s game between Penn and Princeton that sent Harvard to its first NCAA tournament since 1946, my gut betrayed what I knew was best for the Crimson.
I started feeling bad for Penn.
It’s not that I wanted them to win, really. If last year is any indication, one-game winner-takes-all Ivy League playoffs aren’t kind to Harvard.
But unlike Princeton last year, I don’t hate Penn. Yes, I felt robbed after the Penn-Harvard game at Lavietes a few weeks ago, even if the charge call at the end of the game was right.
I really just respect the hell out of Penn. Which is why I think, in the waning moments of the game, as Zack Rosen took his desperation threes, part of me wanted to see the excitement of an Ivy League playoff.
As a fan, I would have been inclined to say that something as significant as reaching the NCAA tournament—something that hasn’t happened in the age of color television—happening hundreds of miles away from campus over a game in which Harvard had no control was a bit unceremonious.
And, as it turns out, I was wrong.
Minutes after the end of the game, after Princeton had sealed Harvard’s trip to March Madness, co-captain Keith Wright gave The Crimson an early front-runner for quote of the year.
“Oh my God, this is crazy, this is absolutely crazy,” Wright said. “You have no idea how excited I am. I’ve been running for 30 minutes, in the freezing cold, screaming at the top of my lungs.”
Now Harvard gets ready for a stage of the basketball season it hasn’t seen in a long, long time. Beyond my interest in what is actually happening on the hardwood, I’m really curious to see what happens to fan interest in the coming week.
On the one hand, I’m excited that the tournament is over spring break because it means that I’ll have the chance to actually go to the games. (Also, who doesn’t want to go to Portland, Albuquerque, or Omaha, right?)
On the other, it’s too bad that the Harvard campus won’t be able to enjoy the event together. I would be inclined to say that this is the biggest sports story at Harvard in a very long time, and to be honest, I have no idea how the campus would react.
I can go off of my Facebook newsfeed last night, which exploded with Harvard basketball celebrations and more exclamation points than I could easily count.
I could go off of the handful of Princeton sweaters that I saw around The Crimson building yesterday, as people evidently took to heart the old mantra that “the enemy of my enemy is my friend.”
It’s unfortunate that unless Harvard makes the Sweet 16, the campus likely won’t be able to watch much of the games together.
Regardless of whether or not the Crimson makes it that far, the transformation over the last couple of years around Harvard basketball has been pretty remarkable. Even during my freshmen year, the only game on the campus’ radar was probably the Cornell-Harvard game.
By no means is the fan involvement anything like a Duke or a Kentucky. It’s not close, and I don’t ever think it will be. Basketball has yet to become a ubiquitous campus presence like it is at other schools from across the country.
But I can say that the whole dynamic has changed in just three years. When I was applying to college, one of the real drawbacks that sports fans at the school complained about was a fundamental lack of interest in Harvard and Ivy League athletics.
Even if for only one of Harvard’s 41 varsity teams, that stigma has changed. And I think the school is a much better place for it. We have houses, classes, concentrations, and extracurricular activities that build community here. But the basketball team is one of the few things that I have seen transcend that—at least based on what my news feed is telling me.
So beyond my interest as a fan, I hope Harvard makes it to the Sweet 16 just to see how the community here would react. Plus, I also have $10 in Vegas on Harvard winning the NCAA title.
Hey, if you’re not going to do it for the fans, at least do it for me.

College students of the world rejoice—and don't feel the need to log off Facebook just yet. According to two blog posts published by the Harvard Business Review this week, it turns out that procrastination might not be as bad for us as we think, and hours spent agonizing over our futures are largely a waste a time. So instead of stressing, don't worry, be happy, and StumbleUpon to your heart's content.
While the key to wasting time effectively may not be quite that simple, efficient procrastination does exist. Research done by scientists at NASA has shown that when we experience a manageable amount of anxiety and stress, our brains produce dopamine that stimulates both innovation and higher performance on assigned tasks. In this sense, procrastination—which is often viewed as the product of a lack of motivation—acts a driving force behind a person's (eventual) productivity.
Just as we have many misconceptions about the merits of procrastination, the popularity of carefully planning one's career may also be misguided. According to Leonard A. Schlesinger, Charles F. Kiefer, and Paul B. Brown, movement within various industries and changes in the economy are too unpredictable to accurately plan ahead for your career. "If you don't know what the world is going to look like five years from now, there is not a lot of sense trying to predict potential external factors planning your career based on that dubious prediction."
Schlesinger, Kiefer, and Brown also argue that individuals who are too focused on rigid career expectations will miss out on other opportunities along the way to a carefully planned goal that may not even exist by the time they are supposed to arrive there. Instead, they suggest that individuals pursue their interests and desires and develop "a strategy to discover and create opportunities consistent with that desire."
You heard it here kiddos: Why do today what you can put off until tomorrow? It seems that tomorrow will take care of itself.

As of Wednesday evening Flyby officially released the rankings of all 12 Houses. Now that freshmen have been informed of their respective Houses, it's important to remember that rankings don't tell the whole story. This gallery shows that there is a lot to love about every House. Each image contains a word cloud of a respective House's answers to the question "What is the best thing about your House?" With the word "community" appearing prominently on every image, it seems clear that House life is what you make of it. Get excited, class of 2015!

Wooohhhoooo! Housing Day! Wooohhhoooo!!! May all your housing dreams come true!!! Between the Housing Day videos that everyone made and this list of videos, you guys are getting approximately twice as many videos as you normally would.

A Person Goes Skiing in The Middle of The City
It was 61 degrees on Wednesday, so it seems like we're finally hitting the tail end of winter just in time for spring break. For the most part, that's great, but it's also a slight bummer since we won't get to do any urban skiing.
A Robot Runs at Speeds of Up to 18 MPH
I just think this one is cool on a strictly technological level. If you can look past the fact that the robot, Cheetah, doesn't really look like its namesake, you're in for a nice preview of what will happen once Skynet becomes self-aware.
Tiny Goats, Wearing Sweaters and Jumping Around
If the above description doesn't hold your interest, I'm not really sure there is anything else I can say to convince you to watch it. If you can spare 26 seconds, however, I think that it's well worth your time.
A Montage of News Anchors Saying Potentially Inappropriate Things
"This is not funny at all," everybody said out loud while watching this video. Though, on the inside, they were secretly laughing to themselves.
A Baby Monkey And a Kitten Have a Fight
It's tough to say who won this fight. Honestly, I would argue that we, the audience, are the real winners. It's not entirely clear what side the dog is on, or even what the kitten and monkey are fighting about. Maybe the monkey took away hot breakfast.
Magic Prank Goes Not-So-Horribly Wrong
In order to pull off the kind of maneuver seen in this video, one would have to have a pretty good understanding of fluid dynamics and weight distribution. Or be very good at taking risks. Either one works, really. Everyone should have their moment in the sun, so congrats to this guy.
Classic Movies Subtitled For Bros
The "Mr. Smith Goes To Washington" translation is particularly well-done, but on a totally subjective and personal level, I did laugh very hard at the translation of the most classic line in "Chinatown." What a great film.
Neil DeGrasse Tyson '80 Provides an Astounding Scientific Fact
The week before break is always a bummer because of midterms and papers and a general rush to cram as much learning as possible into the final few days before vacation. Luckily, Neil DeGrasse Tyson shows up just in time to straight-up blow your mind with science.
Okay, that's all I got. See you after spring break!
