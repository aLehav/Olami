After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


After a deceptively warm beginning to the semester, winter has finally arrived. Residents of Cambridge must struggle to stay warm and dry while trying not to let their fashion game slip up too much. In the midst of snowy blizzards and freezing winds, students, faculty, and tourists alike all bundle up to survive the elements. Here are some common strategies seen around the Yard.
L.L. Bean Boots
The orangey leather and rubber lining—and those distinctive ropy tread marks left in the snow behind them—are all trademarks of winter in Harvard Yard. Sure to keep your feet warm and dry without adding too much bulk, the Bean boots are dependably the most common winter footwear when the snow gets heavy.
Uggs
Those big chunky shearling boots might be a little reminiscent of middle school, especially when paired with leggings or skinny jeans, but they are so warm and fuzzy inside that their persistent presence in college and adult fashion is understandable. They look a little childish, and they do get pretty ratty when wet and stained, but who can turn down the sensation of thick fluffy wool enveloping your feet as you trek through a blizzard?
Timberlands
We used to see mainly guys wearing these light tan boots, but now their clunky but practical style can also be found on women. Timberlands provide a more grown-up alternative to Ugg boots and are waterproof—hence their growing popularity. They still seem to be less ubiquitous than Bean boots but are definitely catching up fast.
Canada Goose
Surely the most common coats to fend off the snow are those black jackets with the fur trim around the hood and that distinctive red logo patch on the sleeve. Toasty, waterproof, and sleeker than most winter coats, Canada Goose jackets provide a nice combination of fashion and practicality. They also completely swallow the head when their hoods are up, so often all that can be seen of their wearers is a ring of fur frosted by snow, shadowing a face within, and legs sticking out the bottom—probably clad in Bean boots or Timberlands.
Pom-Pom Hats
Knit hats topped with an oversized pom-pom seem to be trending this winter. They add height and a fun touch to an outfit while keeping heads warm and hair dry.
Scarves
Another commonly seen accessory is a tightly wrapped scarf. They are conveniently convertible and can be easily removed upon entering warmer spaces or hiked up to cover one’s face from the biting wind chill—or to serve as a handy and subtle disguise.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Undergraduates elected 10 representatives to the Undergraduate Council after voting closed for midterm elections Friday.
In total, 447 students voted in competitive elections, which took place from Feb. 9 to Feb. 12, according to data provided by Election Commission chair Matthew C. Estes ’18. Thirty-five students originally declared candidacy for office.
The most competitive election took place for the lone freshman seat up for re-election in Oak Yard, where 13 students declared candidacy. Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, who garnered 39 first preference votes, won that seat. Oak Yard also saw the largest voter turnout, with 129 students submitting ballots.
Of the 10 students elected to the UC this cycle, six are sophomores.
Two seats were up for election in Dunster House, but only one will be filled, after Mika S. Esquivel ’18 ran uncontested for her seat. The only other uncontested seat was in Dudley House, where Laila M. Smith ’17 was elected.
Two of the UC’s 2015 Executive Board members ran for re-election—former Student Life Committee chair Oliver W. Kim ’16 of Leverett House, and former Treasurer Meghamsh Kanuparthy ’16 of Kirkland House. Kim won his bid for re-election, while Kanuparthy lost to Laura S. Chang ’18 and Parth C. Thakker ’18.
The full list of newly elected representatives is as follows:
Cabot House

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard forward Zena Edosomwan set the tone for his teammates on the first play of Friday night’s home contest with Brown. The junior, a 47.5 percent free throw shooter entering the contest, drained a pair at the line. Clutch free throw shooting down the stretch proved to be the difference in the 79-73 Crimson (10-13, 2-5 Ivy League) victory, the team’s first since Jan. 16.
“I thought we competed very hard,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I thought we had great balance. I was just really happy for our team that they were happy after a game. It’s been a few moments since we’ve had that and I was really proud of them.”
Trailing by five with 1:24 to play, the Bears (7-14, 2-5) began fouling Harvard on offense, looking to extend the game for as long as possible. The strategy appeared to be a good one for Mike Martin and his team, as the Crimson entered the contest shooting 57.7 percent from the line, dead last out of the 346 NCAA Division I programs.
However, Harvard was up to the challenge on Friday. The Crimson made 13 of its final 15 free throws to bury a feisty Brown team that had cut the lead to three with 19 seconds to go. The hosts went 24-of-34 from the charity stripe on the evening.
Senior forward Agunwa Okolie led the way for Harvard, finishing with 15 points, including six free throws, to go along with 12 rebounds and six assists. It was one of the best all-around offensive games Okolie has had in his four years in Cambridge and it could not have come on a more special night for the Ajax, Ontario native.
“You can just see everything that he’s responsible for, and the six assists was just amazing,” Amaker said. “We’ve seen him do the rebounding and scoring but adding that to tonight’s performance was just terrific.”
Okolie was squaring off with his younger brother, Obi, a freshman guard for the Bears. The younger Okolie, normally a reserve for Brown, started and finished the contest with 14 points, the second-most of his college career. With family and friends in the stands, the brothers went toe-to-toe on both ends of the floor, with the younger Okolie covering Crimson’s starting small forward in the Bears’ man-to-man defense.
“You know it’s just one of those moments where it’s like a blessing,” Okolie said. “You think back that it’s great that we’re playing in the Ivy League and it’s important that its academics balancing athletics as well. It’s important to our family so it was exciting.”
While his Harvard teammates got off to a hot start, Okolie struggled from the field in the first half, going just one-of-five from the field. The Crimson jumped out to a six-point lead but a 23-12 Brown run to end the half gave the visitors a lead entering the intermission.
A balanced offensive attack gave the Crimson the lead after the break. Five Harvard players finished in double figures in the contest, including junior guard Corbin Miller, whose 15 points earned him his first double-digit scoring performance since Jan. 23.
With Edosomwan on the floor for just 18 minutes due to a small Brown lineup and lingering effects from a thigh injury, freshman guard Corey Johnson provided a much-needed punch on offense. The Ottawa native made four three-pointers, including three in the second half.
Brown was led by point guard Tavon Blackmon, who finished with 19 points and six assists. The junior was a matchup problem for the Crimson all night and kept the Bears in the contest down the stretch, posting five points and two assists in the game’s final 49 seconds.
“He’s almost impossible to stay in front of,” Amaker said. “We did a poor job toward the end of the game and we just fouled him a number of times reaching for the ball and it just shouldn’t have happened, but he’s so hard to guard, because he’s so quick and fast.”
Harvard stuck with a consistent lineup down the stretch once Brown began employing its fouling tactics. After senior forward Evan Cummins fouled out with 2:34 to play, Amaker rode the experience of Okolie, Miller, and senior forward Patrick Steeves to deliver the win. Steeves made three of his four second half free throws after leading the Crimson with nine first half points.
“Pat is very versatile, handling the ball, inbounding the ball for us, making free throws, making plays off the dribble,” Amaker said. “That’s what we really need him to do, not just for himself, but finding other people when he does drive it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Sometimes when things aren’t going your way, they just aren't going your way.
After its offense went missing in Monday's Beanpot consolation game, the No. 9/9 Harvard men’s hockey team answered with a season-best 50 shots Friday night against No. 18/- Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. However, only one went in.
Sending the rest of them aside was Engineer goaltender Jason Kasdorf, who made a career-high 49 saves on the night, dropping the Crimson (13-8-3, 9-5-3 ECAC) to its fourth loss in the last five games—this one by a score of 2-1.
“Kasdorf, to me, is one of the top goaltenders in college hockey, and he made it a tough night for us,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “But as a coach, you’ve got to tip your hat and move on. I thought our guys worked hard and did a lot of the things we wanted to do and what we haven’t done in quite some time.”
The Crimson offense was firing at will for the entirety of the night, bringing its season shot total against the Engineers (15-10-6, 7-4-6) to a staggering 138—the sum of Harvard’s three highest shot outputs this year. Nonetheless, in the sides’ two most recent contests—the two that count towards the ECAC conference standings—the Crimson could not muster a win.
RPI got on the board a little over 11 minutes into the opening frame, answering a Brayden Jaw strike just two minutes prior.
With senior defenseman Phil Hampton streaking up the right wing, junior winger Jake Wood crashed the net. Once the blue-liner threw a wrister on net, the junior struck gold. Sophomore goaltender Merrick Madsen saved Hampton’s initial shot with his right pad, but standing inches away was Wood, who pushed home the equalizer.
“That settled us down,” said RPI coach Seth Appert, whose side was outshot, 19-8, in the first period. “They still had a lot of offensive zone time, but I thought we limited their elite chances after that."
Harvard continued to apply pressure at the start of the second period, launching the first eight shots of the frame and 13 in total, but the only breakthrough in the period belonged to the Engineers.
Sophomore defenseman Jared Wilson created the opportunity, firing a left-handed wrister at Madsen off an offensive zone faceoff—one that might have been "the only faceoff [RPI] won all night," Appert joked. But the puck never reached the net.
Instead, it bounced its way onto the back of rookie defenseman Adam Baughman, where it sat entangled in the freshman’s jersey. With seven confused skaters surrounding him, Madsen included, Baughman eventually reached behind him and jarred the puck loose.
But once the puck hit the ice, the first one to locate it was sophomore forward Kenny Gillepsie. The Morrisville, N.C., native wasted no time backhanding the bouncing puck into Madsen’s net before anyone had a clue what had happened. Despite being outshot at the time, 27-10, the Engineers had their first lead of the night.
“I think that the puck was in his jersey for probably three or four seconds,” Donato said. “It’s hard. Sometimes the game clock and your mind don’t always match up, but it seemed like it was about three seconds where nobody knew where the puck was…. The referee said that he knew where the puck was and thought it was still alive, but to me personally, I would’ve thought there’d be a whistle there.”
That was all the offensive support Kasdorf would need. With the victory, RPI jumps to 16th in the PairWise rankings and pulls within one point of the Crimson for third place in the ECAC. Meanwhile, Harvard drops to 12th in the PairWise and is now one loss away from potentially falling out of the top four in the conference, which would mean losing a first-round bye in the ECAC tournament.
The result looked like it might have been different early, as Harvard burst out of the gate in the first period with 12 of the game’s first 15 shots and 19 in all for the frame. Midway through the period, Harvard broke through with a tip in front of the net.
Skating behind the goal, junior forward Luke Esposito spotted Jaw atop the right faceoff circle, and the blue-liner sent an off-balanced one-timer on goal, which skipped into the back of the net to temporarily put the hosts in front.
“On that play, we had traffic,” Donato said. “There [were] a lot of people swarming around in front of the net, and that’s the only way [Kasdorf] was going to get beat tonight.”
The goal at 9:22 marked just the third goal of Jaw’s career and his first of the season, but it would stand as the Crimson’s only conversion of the night. Harvard has now scored just one goal in three consecutive games—all losses.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After dropping five straight, the Harvard men’s basketball team finally escaped with a victory in front of a home crowd on Friday night. Although Brown (7-14, 2-5 Ivy League) pulled within three with under a minute to go, the Crimson (10-13, 2-5) held on for the victory, 79-73.
“It's a typical night in our conference with both teams scratching and clawing as we, bottom half of our league, are just fighting to stay alive and afloat,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
AGUNWA’S ATTACK
Coming into the game, how junior forward Zena Edosomwan would return from injury was the major storyline. While Edosomwan tallied 13 points in just 18 minutes, it was senior forward Agunwa Okolie who became Harvard’s most dominant post player of the night.
For much of the night, Okolie faced off against his younger brother, Obi, a freshman guard for the Bears. While the duo finished with nearly identical point contributions–the elder with 15, the younger with 14–it was the way the Crimson’s Okolie lit up the rest of the stat sheet that made him “the best player on the floor,” according to Amaker.
With 12 rebounds, Okolie notched just his second career double-double, but he also added a dimension as a passer, finding his teammates for outside shots.
“We did a great job moving off the ball,” Okolie said. “Corey [Johnson], Corbin [Miller], and Pat [Steeves] did a tremendous job. They were knocking down their shots, and we were able to play inside out.”
With Brown forward Cedric Kuakumensah tallying only two minutes in the first half after getting two fouls in the first two minutes, Amaker went with a smaller lineup to keep up with the Bears in the post. With Okolie being a stronger perimeter defender compared to Edosomwan, Kuakumensah’s absence forced Amaker to limit Edosomwan’s minutes even further than planned as he works his way back from injury.
“It was challenging for us when Kuakumensah wasn’t in the game,” Amaker said. “He’s a good player when he’s in, but when they go really small like that that’s when we’re really worried about some of the threes we could give up if we’re not matched very well.”
RIGHTING THE SHIP
The win was the first in conference play since the Ancient Eight opener against Dartmouth on Jan. 9. Despite heading to the locker room down five, the Crimson played a more complete game than it had in any of the five losses that separated the Ivy victories.
Brown maintained its lead for just under seven minutes until a three by Johnson put Harvard back up one, 44-43 with 13:26 to play. After a bit of back and forth, the Crimson took the lead for good with 11:23 remaining in the second frame on another trey by Johnson.
Harvard improved in every shooting category in the second frame, but the most noticeable improvement was from the charity stripe. All year, Harvard has struggled to take advantage from the line—exemplified by the fact that it sits last in all of Division I basketball in free throw percentage.
But in the second frame, Harvard shot nearly 78 percent from the line, including 13-of-15 shooting over the last 1:24 to seal the victory.
“Our focal point of every game is to get to the free throw line and cash in,” Okolie said. “We haven’t been doing the best job, myself included, but today they fell down for us and we have to keep doing that, can’t be discouraged.”
Though the Crimson still finds itself on the outside looking in to the Ivy Standings, the victory gave the team a much needed confidence boost according to Okolie.
“We don’t have that many games left, especially at home, and it's an unbelievable opportunity to finish our careers here. That’s how you're remembered, that’s how you build your legacy–how did you finish your career? We were able to play tough and competitive today, and everybody, even our freshmen did a great job with their intensity as well, defensively as well. It was a good team effort.”

Classes are in full swing, and even the classes that spent the longest time figuring out sectioning *cough* Road to the White House *cough* have begun to truly dig into the materials. If you are anything like us here at Flyby, you have quite an interesting assortment of characters in your section. You have probably spent the last week trying to figure out how to describe them. Kids in section can at first be hard to characterize, so to help you do so, we find it helpful to liken them to 2016 presidential candidates.
Hillary Clinton - From the very first day of classes, it’s obvious that she is going to be section kid. She’s over eager, always is the first one to raise her hand when a question is asked, and is clearly not going to let this class stand in the way of her perfect 4.0. Oh and not to mention that it’s day two of class and she’s already BFFs with the TF. Whatever the case, she’s super intense, and for some reason she always gets really quiet whenever anyone mentions an email.
Jeb Bush - Jeb is the overtly nerdy guy clad in glasses and a scruffy sweatshirt. At a school literally chocked full of the nerdiest people from around the world, that shouldn’t be a problem. Unfortunately for Jeb, there’s just something about him that makes you want to pick him up by his belt loops and drop him in the nearest dumpster, glee-style. That, or steal his calculator when he’s not looking.
Bernie Sanders - Put simply, Bernie is the kid in section who, week after week, spends 20 minutes articulating his own opinion in front of the whole class. He certainly has no problem expressing his views, regardless of how radical they may be. You secretly agree with him, and will always admire his ability to bring the class off topic.
Marco Rubio -  You want to like him, you truly do, but he has the tendency to aggressively repeat the same line over and over again. The first time that he said it, it was almost intelligent. the seventh time? Not so much.
Donald Trump - You know that arrogant student that saunters into class late every section? That’s Donald. He’ll boast all class long about his success on HCCG and his fondness for summering in the Hamptons. He has “yuuuge” plans, and he’s not afraid to let everyone in section know about them. Plus you can count on him to slip in the occasional offensive comment that will invariably lead to uproar.
John Kasich - You think he is a likable member of your section class, and you feel sort of bad that he is often talked over by some of the more brash members of your section.
Ben Carson - You don’t quite know what to think about this kid. He’s quiet to the point of almost not existing, and when he does speak up, he says something either completely unrelated to the topic at hand, or is way off the mark. It’s obvious that he hasn’t done any of the readings since the semester began and is getting by on the tid-bits that he hears his classmates discussing.
Ted Cruz - Whenever it comes to debates, you want to have this guy in your corner. Apparently he’s a big shot on the debate team? It’s a shame they lost to that prison team earlier this year, though it doesn’t seem to have done anything to deflate his ego. You can’t quite put your finger on it, but something about this guy is just downright terrifying.
Jim Gilmore - Who is he? Must be that guy that the TF always says is missing.
With classmates like these in your section, I hope you’re all gearing up for an exciting semester.

“She gon’ slay.”
We thought she was simply talking about her ever-booming career, the dopeness of her new single, or the publicity via tweetstorm that came in its wake. She warned us and most of us knew to be prepared for the glory that was Beyonce’s Super Bowl halftime show. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem like Coldplay was paying attention to the signs. We loved the energetic mashup of their old and new hits; it was beautiful, truly, but Beyonce’s performance was something more. It was a show fit for a king—nay, a queen.
In true Beyonce fashion, Queen B dropped her single “Formation” one day before she performed it at the halftime show and had every girl singing “come on ladies now let’s get in formation” and every guy that was just treated to Red Lobster patting himself on the back. (Sorry Harvard—we guess iHop is a comparable substitute?)
By the time the Super Bowl rolled around, we had watched the video at least seven times, and tweeted about it at least three times as much. She once again proved that she knows how to break the Internet; people have been tweeting about the song’s pro-black sentiment and arguing over the backlash it’s received since the song’s release.
If anything, she’s made us all realize that entrepreneurship comes in all shapes and sizes. We thought there wasn’t any way that she could get richer, but have you seen those ticket prices for her world tour? We gave the pre sale site a cursory glance and clutched our wallets in despair when we realized that tickets could run someone up to $1500 in debt. Sure, it’s Beyonce, but if she’s right and “the best revenge is your paper” then we’re going to have to keep our money for more important purposes like ordering room service hot chocolate from L.A Burdick's when this Polar Vortex hits us on Sunday.

And yes, we carry hot sauce in our book bags. #slay
