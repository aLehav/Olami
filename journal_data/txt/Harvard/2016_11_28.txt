After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four years ago, I was a senior at Harvard, and for most of that year, I was preoccupied with the question of what I would do after I graduated. For me, that question was overwhelming. At the time, I felt like it was my fault that I was struggling to visualize the job I wanted, apply confidently, and get it (if, perhaps, a fault some of my friends shared).
Now, three years after graduating, I look back on my senior year and see my situation differently. It is now clear to me that part of my confusion came from the fact that my paths out of Harvard led to a very different place than where I came from.
I went to high school in San Bernardino County, California, where my friends’ parents were teachers, physical therapists, contractors, and military officers. My friends matriculated into local colleges that prepared them for these same jobs or more professional ones, like medical researchers, that the community also needed. At the end of college, their schools’ alumni networks and career services connected them to local companies, and, as a result, most of them are now happily employed in Southern California. Their universities did exactly what universities are supposed to do: Educate young people to take their parents’ places in their community and make that community stronger.
Harvard does exactly the same thing, but for an entirely different community: The East Coast upper class. Just like Cal State San Bernardino or UCLA, Harvard offers concentrations, resources, and alumni networks that prepare the young people who go there to fill professional and social roles in that society, but as bankers, for instance, or professors, lawyers, or curators, living mostly in big East Coast cities.
There is nothing inherently wrong with this: Harvard is only doing what a university is supposed to do. But Harvard’s active effort to make its student body more geographically and socioeconomically diverse complicates the situation.
I was part of that effort. The first person from my high school to be accepted to an Ivy League school, I received an incredibly generous financial aid offer that made Harvard more affordable for me than a California public university. I came to Harvard and contributed to the diversity of student life here by bringing a different perspective. In that way, Harvard’s diversity initiative did exactly what it intended.
But then what? By the end of my time at Harvard, two things had inevitably happened. First, my trajectory had been altered so that I was no longer positioned to reenter the southern California community I came from; instead, the education I had received prepared for a completely different world. Second, I was entering this new community without the resources of my classmates who came from it. My parents couldn’t offer me career advice, professional connections, or a home to stay in while I looked for a job. I lacked models for what my post-college life would be like—almost no one in my family, for instance, had earned a graduate degree, which was now an essential but extremely daunting requisite for my own career. The foreignness of my new future was paralyzing.
I’m not sure the right response to this problem is better, or more, career advising. Rather, I think it begins with asking the question: What do we intend to be the benefit of bringing more socio-economic diversity to a college that has historically served our country’s wealthy and elite?
The benefit to Harvard is obvious: Diversity brings incredible richness to the school’s social and intellectual life. But the benefit to students and communities is less guaranteed. I fear that right now, Harvard is acting as a catapult that shoots people from lower classes into the upper one, leaving them in an unfamiliar (and perhaps unwanted) new territory and robbing their communities of value. We shouldn’t accept that situation, because it means that Harvard is failing to perform the social function we expect from a university.
This isn’t a problem that can be solved administratively. In fact, it may be that we—underrepresented students on campus—have unwittingly signed ourselves up for doing that task ourselves. To realize the value of Harvard’s diversity initiative, we’ll have to live with one foot in each world, deciding what responsibilities we want to have to the old community we came from and to the new one we’ve entered into, and bring value to both. We’ll need to reconcile the life we had before with the life we have now—one with so much opportunity and privilege and so little familiarity—and cultivate ourselves the unique perspective that a diverse personal experience promises.
Harvard’s role is to better prepare us do this, and it can prepare us best by giving far more attention to the education and development of personal values and a worldview. We need the space, time, and guidance to think about what we believe in and what matters to us, instead of simply assuming the ways and values of our adoptive home—dislocated as we are from the values and culture that we grew up with. We need an education of morals and character, not just critical thinking, so that we’ll have the courage and wisdom to make decisions about our complicated futures and discern what we want to take from our time spent ‘studying abroad’ at Harvard, and what we’d rather leave behind.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The environmental and scientific policies of our president-elect have brought uncertainty to the future of federal research funding. For an eminent university such as Harvard—whose intellectual output hinges on the success of its research—decreased federal funding poses a dire threat. Harvard science professors have expressed their fears about the imminent Trump presidency, characterizing his opinions on climate change as “anti-science” and “disturbing”.
The views of these Harvard faculty are corroborated at a national level. Donald Trump’s specific action plan regarding climate change, including cancelling the Paris climate deal because it is “bad for U.S. business,” has triggered alarm among scientists nationwide. Not only are Trump’s potential policies viewed as a “possible death rattle for global climate policy,” they are ironically also considered as impediments to Trump’s other goals. As a whole, Trump’s future goals as well as previous track record have “terrified” scientists nationwide and resulted in sympathy and condolences from scientists around the world.
The worry about a decline in federal funding is not unprecedented at Harvard. Since the beginning of federal budget cuts known as sequestration in 2013, there has already been a significant decrease in federal research funding—a decrease deemed concerning by both the University President and Provost. In response to this contingency, as well a to similar cutbacks in earlier years, Harvard has turned to alternative non-federal funding through corporations, foundations, and donors. These independent initiatives have led to ventures such as the Harvard Stem Cell Center Institute.
While researchers in the sciences have been the most vocal about the potential consequences of Trump and further cuts to federal funding, the humanities also stand to lose much in the age of Trump. The current trend towards devaluing and underfunding a humanities education—and the critical thinking it teaches—has played a role in creating a political environment conducive to Trump, and it seems unlikely that a Trump presidency will help this state of affairs.
Fortunately, Harvard is at an advantage compared to other institutions because of the University’s ability to leverage private funding. Now, it is more important than ever to continue to pursue these avenues of research funding, especially once the political landscape changes with Trump’s inauguration. By doubling down on non-federal support, Harvard and other comparable research institutions can combat potential slashes in federal funding that may be a part of Trump’s agenda.
Nevertheless, it is important to seek private donors that will fund research to the same level of impartiality that federal dollars would. In ensuring that donations are equally accessible to all types of research Harvard pursues, the university can continue to fund strong and impartial research, even in the face of both sequestration and a Trump presidency.
as the director of the American Physical Society has dubbed Trump.  Harvard, however, with its broad donor base, can likely offset the negative repercussions of Trump’s policies by culling non-federal funds. As long as private research donors continue to support research impartially, Harvard should pursue all possible sources of funds to ensure that an anti-science presidency does not do irreparable harm to American research.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When I told my family that I had decided to concentrate in government, their expectations weren’t exactly aligned with those of Harvard. My father believed I would learn how to resolve our rocky relationship with the former Soviet world. My mother believed I would learn how to fix our nation’s broken immigration system. Now that I’m a junior, I still know nothing of immigration law, nor am I any closer to understanding U.S.-Russia relations.
Instead, I’ve dedicated most of my time to learning political theory. Can I name all 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitution? Nope. Do I understand electoral law? Go fish. Nevertheless, I’ve built a substantial arsenal of dry, demotivating quotes from a handful of dead political theorists. Apparently I’ve also learned to write eloquent papers regarding the implications of Kantian thought on American governance. And yet, I haven’t read anything written by Kant in its entirety, or anything authored by the various political scientists I regularly quote in my papers, for that matter.
With the advent of the Digital Revolution, I think it makes little sense to read incomprehensible theories written by overrated, arrogant, European men, especially when simplified versions exist online. Last year, I was assigned a particularly difficult reading on John Stuart Mill. After struggling with his archaic language for an hour, I turned to a helpful philosophy series on YouTube. Within a matter of minutes, I was well on my way to writing a decent paper.
I did not start college with this cynical approach to what our faculty dub “an unparalleled educational journey that is intellectually, socially, and personally transformative.” During freshman fall, I diligently completed every assigned reading I was given. Not once did I skip a page; I believed the authors had poured their souls into their work and, as such, deserved my attention.
Boy, was I a fool. I wasted hours a day learning supposedly critical material, when in fact, all that seems to matter is that my papers and comments sound academic. My best papers thus far were not those that rested on solid facts, but rather those that employed the loftiest language and most closely mimicked the ideal academic paper.
The focus on academic writing has stifled both my creativity, and, ironically, my ability to write succinctly and naturally. The typical paper structure—an intro, a thesis, a series of body paragraphs with clear topic sentences and strong concluding statements, coupled with a counterargument and conclusion—proves more limiting than helpful. Rather than seem distinct, each of my papers flows identically. Perhaps this weakness has bled into my columns as well.
Instead of arming its students with career-related technical skills, Harvard strives to teach its students the art of independent learning. However, as I sit down to write yet another wave of bland papers, I can’t help but think that Harvard has lied to me. Instead of teaching us how to learn, Harvard’s non-STEM departments have limited our learning to one medium: papers.
If you were to take a look at the syllabi that outline the government and general education courses I’ve taken thus far, you would immediately notice that papers typically comprise anywhere between 50-70 percent of your grade in a given class. Given the ungodly number of papers I’ve written, combined with the heavy academic weight Harvard assigns them, you’d think a Harvard degree in government would, at the very least, prepare one to enter government.
However, as I learned the hard way this summer, my assumption was all but false. For eight weeks I had the pleasure of working at the Pentagon, and my god, I was about as useful as a broken office stapler. The Department of Defense lives and dies by the art of briefness. Brief memos, brief presentations, and brief negotiations comprise the world of national security.
My boss could care less that I could successfully deconstruct Lipset’s modernization theory or debate the merits of Tocqueville’s "Democracy in America" in a 10-12 page paper. At the end of the day, what mattered was my extensive knowledge of regional history, and after a few days scrounging Wikipedia, I felt more prepared than I had been having just arrived from Harvard.
Over these next few days, I will spend long nights writing papers that will only be read once and, for better or worse, will be judged on their flow, not veracity. I will not plan speeches or debates that showcase my mastery of the course material. I will not be given an oral exam to test the strength of my nerve. I will not be given the opportunity to implement social work or a large scale project to substitute for a traditional assignment.
Instead I will write papers. Long papers. Boring papers. Meaningless papers. But hell, over these past two and a half years, I’ve gotten pretty good at writing papers. If Harvard has its way, on graduation day it’s the only thing I’ll ever be good at.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Law professor Mark V. Tushnet ’67 landed on a “watchlist” of liberal professors created by the conservative nonprofit organization Turning Point USA last week.
According to the group’s website, the goal of the list is to “expose and document college professors who discriminate against conservative students and advance leftist propaganda in the classroom.” Turning Point USA aims to instill conservative principles such as support of free markets and limited government in college students.
Tushnet earned his spot on the list in part because of a blog post he wrote in May for the website Balkinization. In the post, he argued that conservative Christians have lost the “culture wars,” and that the victors should take a “hard line” with the losers.
He also wrote that “taking a hard line seemed to work reasonably well in Japan and Germany after 1945,” an argument that Turning Point USA singled out as an issue.
“Mark Tushnet... asked liberals to begin treating Christians and conservatives like Nazis,” the watchlist read.
Tushnet said he was unperturbed by his inclusion on the list.
“It’s not a big deal,” he said. “It comes with the territory.”
However, Tushnet said he has received more hate mail since the publication of the list, as he did after the blog post was published in May. A variety of websites, including the far-right website Breitbart, picked up his remarks.
“The fact that there are people who have these views and are willing to express them is worth paying attention to, but not on a personal level,” Tushnet said.
The list includes around 200 professors.

Dozens of the biggest political advisers and journalists from the 2016 election will visit Harvard’s Institute of Politics this week to debrief on the most divisive presidential campaign in recent history.
Campaign managers for both President-elect Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton are slated to speak at the two-day IOP event called “Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 2016,” which will be held Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Controversial right-wing media mogul and Trump’s chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon will also be on campus over the course of the two-day event, though a draft of the agenda did not include him among the list of speakers. 
The Kennedy School has hosted a similar event after every presidential election since 1972, Interim IOP Director Bill Delahunt wrote in a statement to The Crimson. This year’s will feature a host of prominent political strategists and journalists, including CNN anchor Jake Tapper, Snapchat head of news Peter Hamby, and political statistician Nate Silver. The speakers will discuss the strategies of both presidential campaigns, the media’s role in politics, and the results of November’s election.
Events will include roundtable discussions about the primaries and the conventions, as well as the general election, according to a draft of the agenda. The final event of the program is a panel titled “War Stories: Inside Campaign 2016,” and will bring together Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook. That discussion will be open to Harvard affiliates and broadcast on CNN on Dec. 4.
The two-day event comes as Harvard affiliates comes to terms with the reality of a Trump presidency. Many students and faculty have criticized the president-elect for some of his recent White House appointments, particularly his selection of Bannon as chief strategist. Hundreds of Business School alumni and the Dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study have denounced some of Bannon’s comments and political views as racist, misogynistic, and anti-Semitic.
Before working as Trump’s campaign’s CEO, Bannon was a founding member and executive chair of the right-wing media outlet Breitbart News.
In an interview last week, Lauren Rourke, one of the authors of a New York Times letter signed by more than 1,000 female graduates of Harvard Business School condemning Bannon’s appointment, said she thought Harvard should not invite Bannon to speak on campus. She did not know about the IOP event at the time.
Rourke and Ali Huberlie, the letter’s other principal author, declined to comment on Bannon’s upcoming appearance at the IOP event.
Delahunt wrote in a statement that the IOP event ultimately aims to “to allow future candidates, managers, journalists and scholars a better understanding of the nature of modern presidential campaigns.”

Following a divisive presidential election, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana said he will prioritize protecting Harvard’s undocumented undergraduates as President-elect Donald Trump transitions into office, though he did not offer specific plans.
In an interview last Tuesday, Khurana said Loc Truong, the Office of Student Life’s Director of Diversity and Inclusion Programs, is now a “point person” for undocumented students’ concerns. Khurana added that he, Truong, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair have been meeting individually with students since “almost immediately after the election.” 
Many people at Harvard and around the United States have criticized Trump for rhetoric targeting immigrants and Muslims. During his campaign, Trump suggested banning Muslims from entering the country, proposed deporting millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants, and repeatedly pledged to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.
Khurana said he empathizes with groups that Trump specifically targeted throughout his campaign.
“I think there’s been a significant amount of focus on supporting [undocumented] students at this time of uncertainty,” Khurana said.
In the weeks since the election, Harvard faculty and students have rallied in support of undocumented students. A petition calling on Harvard administrators to support undocumented population has garnered more than 4,000 signatures, and has received endorsements from at least three academic departments.
The petition demands the College create an office specifically meant to cater to undocumented student needs, and for the OSL to immediately hire a replacement for Emelyn A. dela Pena, the College’s former associate dean for equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Khurana did not specify whether or not the College will create a new office for undocumented students, but said the College recently hired a consultant to assist in the search process for dela Pena’s replacement.
“Our mission, whatever their immigration status, where they were born, they are Harvard,” Khurana said.
Students and professors across the University have largely criticized Trump’s candidacy and transition into the presidency. An overwhelming majority of undergraduates—about 87 percent—supported Hillary Clinton ahead of the election, and many people reacted to Trump’s victory with shock and anger.
Speaking about the election more generally, Khurana denounced a recent nationwide surge of hate speech and hate crimes, some of which have taken place within Harvard’s gates.
“Hate has no place at Harvard,” he said. “I think that we live in a time of uncertainty and fear, and Harvard has a unique opportunity to do what it always has done, which is stand tall and stand up for some really foundational values that I think are the bedrock of our country.”

In what’s becoming a competitive rivalry between the Harvard men’s basketball team and the University of Massachusetts, Saturday’s matchup between the Crimson (1-3) and the Minutemen (4-1) was certainly no exception. In a close game that featured 14 ties and nine lead changes, it was UMass that came away with the 70-64 victory in Amherst on Saturday.
“I have loved this series,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “Every game has been this kind of game. They’ve been terrific basketball games. I wish we could’ve come out on top this afternoon, or even the one last year, but we’ve had these kinds of games every time we’ve played.”
With less than a minute to go in the second half, and following a pivotal three from sophomore guard Corey Johnson to cut the Minutemen’s lead to three, freshman forward Seth Towns came up with a steal and was fouled. He sank both free throws to cut UMass’s lead to one at 65-64 before Harvard fouled Minutemen guard Donte Clark with 14 seconds on the clock.
After making the first, Clark missed the second. But he came up with his own rebound despite four Harvard players alone in the paint.
“It shouldn’t have happened,” Amaker said. “There’s no way that should happen with four of our guys in the lane. We just kind of fell asleep and didn’t block up the shooter.”
After failing to get the rebound, the Crimson then sent UMass to the line twice, allowing the hosts to close out the win.
Saturday’s matchup was one largely defined by poor shooting from both teams and turnovers. Harvard shot 37 percent from the field while coughing up the ball 19 times. For their part, the Minutemen shot 40 percent and turned over the ball 12 times.
With a starting lineup that featured four freshman—Chris Lewis, Seth Towns, Henry Welsh, and Justin Bassey—the Crimson built an early 6-0 lead with co-captain Siyani Chambers running the floor. This margin would amount the largest Crimson advantage of the game, as the two teams then traded off scores for much of the game.
Lead by Clark, who finished the game with 29 points and five rebounds, the Minuteman quickly cut Harvard’s lead in what would be a largely deadlocked game.
“They didn’t shoot particularly well, and we didn’t shoot particularly well,” Amaker said. “[Clark] was the one who really carried their team, and we just couldn’t really defend him,”
In addition to the career night from Clark, Harvard struggled on the offensive end, where the team struggled to score late and missed some key free throws. Freshman guard Bryce Aiken, who sat out last week’s game against Holy Cross due to an ankle injury, went 0-of-9 from the field, and the Crimson turned the ball over twice in the last two minutes of play.
“I think we made some inexperienced mistakes,” Amaker said. “Those are probably going to happen a lot with as many of the young guys as we’re playing. But I’m pleased with the effort and with the spirit of our team.”
Despite shooting 33 percent from the field, the Crimson ended the first half tied at 32 with UMass. Dealing with foul trouble and still adjusting to different rotations, Harvard struggled to shut down the Minutemen in the second half.
“Chris Lewis got into foul trouble for us, so that kind of disjointed us a little. But I felt good about the rotation,” Amaker said. “We didn’t take care of the ball, the 19 turnovers really killed us and hurt us, but I liked the lineups we were playing.”
Lewis would foul out with over 10 minutes left in the second half, and Clark went off for 22 of his 29 in the second to defeat Harvard.
“It seems like all of our games against UMass have been tough, hard-fought, possession-by-possession,” Amaker said. “Games where we have both gone down to the wires to have to pull games out or have some gut-wrenching losses. You have to give a lot of credit to their team and their kids for making the necessary plays when the game was on the line.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After a short Thanksgiving break, Harvard women’s basketball (4-1) found itself back in Cambridge to take on the Fairfield Stags (3-3). Heading into the matchup, the Stags led the series against the Crimson 9-2 and boasted a four-game winning streak against Harvard.
Consider that streak over. Harvard snapped its losing ways against the Stags, claiming a 58-44 victory. In doing so, the Crimson pushed a winning streak of its own to four games.
“I thought this was our first real dominant game,” said co-captain Destiny Nunley. “It felt good to pull away from a team for once and to have a feel good win and not have to be battling at the end of the game.”
The victory at Lavietes Pavilion not only gave the Crimson its fourth straight win but also gave head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith her 550th career victory. Delaney-Smith is the 45th coach in Division 1 women’s basketball history to reach 550 career wins.
“I didn’t even know it was 550. That’s good—that’s a lot of wins, huh?” Delaney-Smith said. “You know what’s really funny: I’m very proud of that, but I never think in terms of milestones.”
Although the historic mark may not have been a focus of Delaney-Smith or her squad, it was a moment that the players were happy to play a part in.
“We didn’t know, but I’m not surprised,” Nunley said. “She’s an amazing woman and even better coach. It just feels good to win for her, and we just want to see how many more we can get this season.”
Harvard freshman guard Katie Benzan sunk a three pointer in the closing minutes of  Saturday night’s game. “She is cold! She is cold!” exclaimed a Harvard fan from the student section as the Crimson went up by six points.
Benzan as well as the rest of the Harvard squad had ice in their veins as the team finished the game with a 14-point margin of victory, the largest mark this year.
Fairfield remained in the game through the start of the fourth quarter, and with a little over five minutes left, Fairfield’s senior forward Kristine Miller made a lay-up to bring the Stags within four points of the Crimson. That was the last time Harvard allowed Fairfield to score the rest of the contest.
“I actually loved our defense,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our offensive execution was good [too]—good shots, and missed shots.”
Still, the Crimson missed a lot of shots. The team’s field-goal percentage on the night was 35 percent, falling well below the team average on the season. Harvard also shot 25 percent beyond the arc, making only four three-pointers. The performance definitely was a letdown for a team that averaged nine three-pointers a game coming into the contest.
“Unfortunately tonight, although we did win, it wasn’t our best shooting night,” co-captain Taylor Finley said. “We’ve definitely shot better, and we know we’re better shooters than we showed tonight.”
Despite Harvard’s rough night of shooting, its defense proved stout enough that the winners still ended the game with a higher field goal percentage, three-point percentage, and rebound total.
“Our coach makes sure to tell us to finish a play till we get the rebound or score,” Nunley said. “That’s what we work on in practice all the time. We’re crashing the boards till the play is dead.”
The Crimson collected 48 rebounds, with 15 off the offensive glass. Most teams would be happy with that production, but for Harvard it was merely a product of poor shooting.
“We adjusted to the fact that we weren’t hitting the shots that we normally do,” Nunley said. “In response we crashed really hard, and I don’t think they were expecting that. As a result, that sent us to the line a lot.”
The Crimson took 18 shots from the charity stripe and sunk 12 of them. Good free throw shooting in the midst of poor three-point shooting would prove essential for the Harvard triumph.
A notable performance came from off the bench as sophomore guard Sydney Skinner scored 14 points, matching her career high, in the contest. The Plano, TX native gave the Crimson the boost it needed, along with junior forward Taylor Rooks, who recorded six points, four blocks, and 10 rebounds
“Taylor Rooks [being] able to come in and drop a few points for us and give our team confidence is a beautiful thing,” Nunley said. “We haven’t had that [depth] in year’s past since I’ve been here, but this year we do and that’s really exciting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the second year in a row, the Harvard women’s ice hockey team (1-8, 1-4 ECAC) faced off against No. 4/3 Minnesota-Duluth (10-3-3, 7-3-2 WCHA). This year’s double header was played in Cambridge, though the Crimson was not able to defend home ice and dropped both games to the Bulldogs.
Harvard 1, Minnesota-Duluth 2
In the second matchup in the weekend series between the two teams, the Crimson came close to avoiding its eighth loss of the season, but ultimately fell to the Bulldogs 2-1 in overtime.
After losing by a score of 4-1 to previous day, Harvard’s close encounter with Duluth showed improvement on the ice over the course of the home stand.
“The advantage to playing a team the night before is that you know what they are trying to do and how they play,” junior defenseman Chelsea Ziadie said. “In the game on Saturday we really stuck to our players in the D-zone and focused on our breakouts and tightened up a few things which really helped our game.”
With neither teams scoring until the third period of play, the opening 40 minutes of the game was a defensive standoff on both sides of the ice. Senior goaltender Molly Tissenbaum saw a combined 24 shots on goal in the first and second period, with the Crimson only being able to muster nine over the same amount of time.
It was Harvard who struck the back of the goal first. Assisted by senior defenseman Briana Mastel and junior forward Lexie Laing, senior defenseman Abby Frazer was able to break away from the pack and place the puck past Bulldog goalie Maddie Rooney.
The Crimson lead would hold for less than 10 minutes as Duluth answered the goal with one of their own when Ashleigh Brykaliuk fooled Tissenbaum with help from teammates Lara Stalder and Katherine McGovern.
As the third period came to a close without either team breaking the stalemate, the game was sent into overtime. However, it did not take long for Duluth to break the silence, as Staider had her second assist of the game, this time aiding teammate Sidney Morin in scoring the game-winning goal.
Though the loss did drop Harvard to 1-8, the improvements in play between the two weekend matches was tabgible.
“This weekend we really came together as a team and gave it everything we had,” junior forward Dani Krzyszczyk said. “The difference between Friday and Saturday nights games was that we truly believed in ourselves the entire game and never quit.”
Harvard 1, Minnesota-Duluth 4
Once again, it was the Crimson that notched the first goal of the game but failed to come away with the victory. On Friday night in the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, freshman forward Kat Hughes netted her second goal of the season at the 11:19 mark of the first period, but that would prove to be all the Harvard offense could muster on the night.
The center of attention for the night was Bulldog senior forward Katie McGovern, who lit up the Crimson defense for two goals in the third period with one coming off of a power play. Duluth was able to convert on two of its five power plays, with the other goal coming from junior forward Michelle Lowenheim late in the third period of play.
Despite the dominance on the offensive side of the ice the Bulldogs showed late in the game, the match up with the 4/3 seed provides Harvard with heavy competition early in the winter.
“The beginning of our season is always traditionally is always very tough,” Ziadie said. “We play some great teams and we’re always up for the challenge. No matter who we play we’re always trying to do the best we can regardless of who our opponent is.”

With 55 seconds left in the second overtime and down one point, captain Joey Colton connected with  freshman Austin Sechrest to even the score and force a sudden death overtime. Minutes later, the Crimson would strike again to clinch its first ever NCAA championship win on Saturday. The No. 10 Harvard men’s water polo team (26-6) took down No. 12 Bucknell (23-5), 13-12 in sudden death overtime to advance to the next round of play-in games.
“It’s the postseason, it’s the NCAA tournament,” sophomore Nathan Ondracek said. “No team is going to come out and give us an easy game. We were prepared to have to fight for four quarters which turned into four quarters and three overtime periods.”
Bucknell scored first, finding the back of the net midway through the first quarter. Sechrest answered with a penalty shot a few minutes later, but Bucknell scored again to round out the quarter with the 2-1 lead.
Momentum flipped in the second quarter when senior Noah Harrison capitalized on a Bucknell foul with another penalty-shot goal with only 2:45 left in the half to birth a 9-2 run by Harvard. Senior Dan Stevens followed with two consecutive goals of his own to even out the score 4-4 before entering intermission.
“We kept fighting for the whole game which is a good sign,” Ondracek said.
The Crimson came out of the gates hot in the second half, outscoring the Bison 5-2 in the third quarter. Senior Viktor Wrobel scored the first goal of the half, followed by another goal by Dan Stevens to ensure a hat trick. The last three of the quarter were scored by freshman Charlie Owens and sophomores Nick Bunn and Grayson Judge.
Early in the fourth, Harvard widened the gap to 10-6 with a long strike from Colton to take a comfortable four goal lead. However, Bucknell wouldn’t go out that easily and slowly brought the game back within one goal (10-9) with only three minutes left on the clock. The Bison’s Rade Joksimovic, conference player of the year and rookie of the year, tied up the game 10-10 with a second-chance goal and only 19 seconds left in regulation play.
“It was a great team effort. I think our depth and stamina was really tested, we hadn’t played a team that long all season,” junior captain Harry Tafur said. “Hats off to Bucknell they played us one hell of a match. In most games going down 10-6 in the fourth quarter is a sure fire win for the winning team and they brought it back… They really kept their composure and gave us a great game.”
Bucknell was able to get on the board first in the first overtime, but Harvard answered and forced a second.
In the second overtime, the first two minutes were scoreless until Harvard broke through and forced another overtime.
The Crimson defense held strong, keeping Bucknell scoreless on two possessions. Then, with 1:20 remaining, sophomore goalie Anthony Ridgley found Tafur down the pool. Tafur fought through Bucknell defense to score the game winning goal and secure the chance to compete for a spot in the final four in California.
“For me personally I was really excited. Obviously being part of team that has just broken the number of wins record is incredible and to do it on such a balanced team where everyone is contributing is a great feeling,” Tafur said. “The team on the whole is really happy but also really focused on this next game we have on Thursday and looking forward to taking a shot at the final four.”
Stevens led the offense with three goals and Sechrest and Colton notched two of their own along with two assists as well. The defense totaled 10 steals, led by two each from Colton and Harrison. Ridgley was dominating between the posts with 11 saves, three steals, and one assist.
“Everyone’s excited,” Ondracek said. “It was the seniors’ last game to ever play at home so a lot of emotions there… We keep saying that we don’t want our story, this team’s story, to end. We didn’t want that story to end at this game. Everyone’s happy that we get to practice a few more times and play at least one more game with this team.”
