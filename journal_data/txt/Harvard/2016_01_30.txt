After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite coming back from a 15-point deficit at halftime and a 24-point effort by junior forward Zena Edosomwan, the Harvard men’s basketball team dropped its second consecutive conference matchup, falling to Cornell Friday night, 77-65.
Harvard coach Tommy Amaker consistently emphasizes the importance of the first four minutes of a half. And for the first for minutes of both halves on Friday, the Crimson was executing that plan to near perfection.
In the first half, the Crimson (9-10, 1-2 Ivy League) kicked off the contest with a 10-2 run over the first 7:20 of the game. After the Big Red (8-9, 1-2) started the scoring off of a goaltending call on Edosomwan, Harvard did not give up a field goal until freshman guard Matt Morgan hit a three with 12:40 to go. Over the next three minutes, Cornell fought back and eventually took a two-point lead off of another Morgan trey.
Despite playing without its leading scorer Robert Hatter, the Big Red offense didn’t seem fazed after escaping the early lag. Morgan was especially troublesome for the Crimson defense, finishing with 33 points, nearly half of which came from behind the arc.
The teams had stark contrast in size, with Harvard able to take advantage of the Big Red in the paint and feed Edosomwan at will, but Cornell’s speed advantage in the backcourt was too much for the Crimson to handle.
“We just couldn’t guard them.” Amaker said. “They were really small...we didn’t think our bigs could chase those smaller guys around, and sometimes you try to stick with that and make them adjust to you, but I was worried. Obviously what we tried didn’t work.”
Capped off by a buzzer-beating layup by Morgan, the Big Red went to the locker room up by 15 on the reigning Ivy League champions.
In the second half, Amaker’s four-minute mantra was clicking well past the under-16 media timeout. Despite the double-digit deficit, Harvard regained the lead with 13:29 to go. While the Crimson shot seven-of-nine over the nearly seven minute stretch that put Harvard back up, it was the defense that the team pointed to as the key to the comeback.
“We always say our defense leads the offense,” freshman guard Tommy McCarthy said. “I thought we did a great job defending them and then defensive rebounding. That kind of helped our offense a lot, we started clicking, started hitting shots.
Amaker left his five starters in for the entirety of the comeback, with all but senior Agunwa Okolie tallying points in the early minutes of the second half.
“We came out with gangbusters,” Amaker said. “They did a fantastic job of getting us back in that game and making it a game because we were certainly down and out there at the end of the first half.”
McCarthy and Edosomwan jelled for much of the night on the offensive end, especially in the second frame where Edosomwan tallied 17 of his 24 points. The Los Angeles native already had a size advantage coming into the night, but with Cornell bigs David Onuorah, Jordan Abdur-Ra’oof, and Stone Gettings all in foul trouble, McCarthy was able to find Edosomwan for lob passes under the hoop at will.
“We know Zena—most of the time he’ll have the advantage, so if I throw it up to him, 90 percent of the time, he’s going to come down with it,” McCarthy said. “[We were] kind of just trying to exploit that. They played kind of a small lineup for a little bit of the game, so we knew we could pound it inside to Z, and we knew he could finish it.”
But once again, the Big Red battled back after struggling out of the locker room and never let Harvard build a lead greater than four.
From there, the teams traded baskets until Morgan hit a three with 3:26 to go that put Cornell up for good.
But the Crimson has little time to dwell on the loss. The team turns around to play expected Ivy contender Columbia Saturday night.
When asked how the team can mentally turn around quickly to prepare for the Lions in less than 24 hours, Edosomwan was clear.
“To be honest with you, I don’t think we really have a choice,” Edosomwan said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The last time the Harvard and Princeton men’s hockey teams clashed, Jimmy Vesey provided the Crimson with the only goal it would need in a shutout of the Tigers at Hobey Baker Memorial Rink.
In the rematch Friday night at the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Vesey may not have struck first, but he did strike last.
After being given limited room to roam all night long, Vesey finally found an open lane with less than eight minutes remaining following a “panic play,” as Princeton coach Ron Fogarty called it, on the part of the Tigers. With No. 7/7 Harvard hanging onto a 2-1 edge, the co-captain broke free along the right wing, fed junior forward Alexander Kerfoot in the slot, and continued marching forward.
Threading the needle between two defenseman, Kerfoot immediately returned the puck back to the Crimson’s sharp-shooter, and Vesey did not disappoint. Standing 10 feet from goaltender Colton Phinney, the co-captain rocketed a one-timer past the glove of the Princeton junior to double Harvard’s lead. Seven minutes later, the ECAC’s leading point-getter put one more into the back of an empty net, capping a 4-1 victory over the visiting Tigers (5-13-2, 3-8-2 ECAC).
“We knew coming in it would be a tough game,” Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “We expected it to be a one-goal game, and for the most part, that’s what it was. In the third period, we were able to make a couple plays and found a way to win the game.”
For the second time in as many meetings, the final score was hardly indicative of the play between the two sides. Much like their first bout on Nov. 14 when a 1-0 affair was masked by two Crimson empty-netters in the final minute of play, Friday night’s contest was tight just about all of the way through.
In fact, the Allston rematch followed a similar blueprint as the matchup that took place two months prior—Harvard (12-4-3, 8-3-3) dominated the first period, and the Tigers sprung to life in the second.
The Crimson caught a break just moments after puck drop as Tiger forward Ryan Siiro provided the Harvard power play—ranked second in the country for its 32 percent scoring clip—an opportunity to take the ice just 25 seconds in.
On the man advantage, junior defenseman Clay Anderson launched a shot from atop the left circle that Phinney kicked into the slot. Junior forward Sean Malone then collected the rebound, drifted to his left to avoid defenseman Hayden Anderson, and lifted the puck over the netminder’s right pad to put the hosts on the scoreboard at 1:56.
Meanwhile, the Princeton offense could get nothing going.
Skating without Victor Newell and Jake Olson—two of its six usual starting defensemen, Harvard held the Tigers without a shot on goal for 12 consecutive minutes during the opening period. Princeton would finish the frame with just five attempts.
Meanwhile, the Harvard attack, which early on was held in check at even strength, began creating more opportunities as the period went on. But Phinney, who stopped 39 of 40 shots in the teams’ last meeting, made 12 saves in the stanza to keep his side within one.
Unlike the November meeting, however, the Crimson beat Phinney a second time in the middle frame, as junior center Tyler Moy upped Harvard’s lead to two at the 5:40 mark—all thanks to a turnover.
“I kind of got a gift,” Moy admitted. “I just tried to make the most of it.”
Looking to break out of his own zone, top-pair defenseman Joe Grabowski pushed the puck up-ice, but Moy intercepted the pass and flew back into the Tiger end. Stepping around one defenseman and moving left to right on Phinney, the third-liner nudged the puck between the post and the goaltender’s outstretched pad, pushing the score to 2-0.
Outside of the one lapse, however, Princeton played its best hockey in the middle frame. The Tigers more than tripled their first-period shot total in the period, sending 18 shots in the direction of Harvard goaltender Merrick Madsen, who stopped all but one of them—a Tommy Davis rip from the right faceoff dot at 9:04.
Princeton nearly equalized at two with just over a minute to go in the frame, as Siiro—down on his knees with his back to Madsen in the slot—flung a backhander on target that Madsen knocked in the direction of junior center Garrett Skrbich, open on the post. But protecting his net, the sophomore goaltender—who finished with 33 saves—sprawled across the crease to keep the puck out.
Vesey’s two third-period goals, his 15th and 16th of the season, closed out the win, allowing the Crimson to maintain its one-point edge over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for second place in the ECAC standings.
“It’s a big two points in the Ivy League [and a] big two points in our league standings, especially with us only having the opportunity for two this weekend and most teams in our league having a chance to get four,” Donato said.
“And quite frankly,” he added, “I think there’s probably a little bit of relief as soon as the game’s over. We can start to focus on the Beanpot and Monday night, which I think the guys are very excited about.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The stage was set Friday afternoon in Cambridge for a show down between two of the ECAC’s top hockey teams. Harvard (11-8-1, 8-6-1 ECAC) came into the game ranked fifth in the conference standings and played host to No. 4/4 Quinnipiac (21-1-4, 11-1-3), the top seeded team in the ECAC.
After 60 minutes of grueling hockey, one shot proved to be the difference between the two teams. Bobcat freshman forward Melissa Samoskevich went home with the only tally of the night, giving Quinnipiac the 1-0 victory on the road.
“We have a lot to learn from these games,” co-captain goaltender Emerance Maschmeyer said. “We’re learning that we can’t save it until the last bit of the game and we need to start strong.”
The Crimson failed to come out of the gate with all engines fully loaded, taking only five shots on goal in the first period. The only time the team had taken less chances at scoring was its previous matchup against the Bobcats, during which the tally was a mere two shots.
Quinnipiac, however, skated onto the ice in full force, taking three shots on goal in the first three minutes. The opportunity for a scoring drive came at the 6:26 mark of the contest when sophomore forward Lexie Laing was called for a hooking penalty. Quinnipiac went to work having the man-up situation on the ice, taking two consecutive shots on goal in the opening 30 seconds of the power play.
The third shot of the power play was the charm, as defender Kristen Tamberg took a shot that got past Harvard’s first line of defense. In a scramble in front of the net, the Bobcats regained control of the puck and freshman forward Melissa Samoskevich was able to deflect a shot off Maschmeyer for the first goal of the game. The goal was reviewed by the officials but stood as the first tally of the contest.
“[Samoskevich] shot it, and the puck was sitting in front of our [defense] at one of their player’s feet, and I was behind them. And somehow I got moved to the side, so I thought it was their player that moved me, but they reviewed it, and it turned out to be one of our girls,” Maschmeyer said.
Despite the one goal tallied against her, Maschmeyer had a career high number of saves on the night, stopping 37 of the Bobcats’ 38 shots on goal. Quinnipiac goaltender Sydney Rossman faced 20 shots over the course of the night, stopping all Harvard scoring attempts to record the shut out.
The Crimson attempted to come out stronger in the second period, opening the period with a quick shot against Rossman, who came up with a butterfly save to keep Harvard at bay. The second 20-minute block of time saw the Crimson come up with six shots on goal, although the Bobcats mirrored their 14 shots from the first period.
“It’s just a matter of trying to take better care of the puck and get ourselves to the net,” head coach Katey Stone said. “We didn’t have a lot of options coming out of our own zone tonight so they made it very tough on us.”
The two times Harvard had the man-up advantage were squandered, leaving the Crimson unable to capitalize on either Bobcat penalty. In the second period, junior defender Emma Greco was called for tripping, to which the Crimson responded with an immediate shot against Rossman. Quinnipiac was able to quiet the Harvard attack, eating time off the penalty clock by clearing the puck down the ice multiple times during the power play.
“Our two best opportunities on the power play were on entry,” Stone said. “We had two opportunities to score right off the bat, and it just didn’t happen, and we sort of threw the puck around. We need to be a little bit more composed in those situations.”
The Bobcats were riding a four game win streak going into Friday afternoon’s matchup, while the Crimson was coming off of a win against Dartmouth after dropping its previous three games. The Crimson will face off against Princeton in another ECAC match up Saturday afternoon.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite overcoming a 15-point halftime deficit, the Harvard men’s basketball team (9-10, 1-2 Ivy League) fell to Cornell (8-9, 1-2) at home on Friday, 77-65. The Big Red, which was playing without star Robert Hatter, was led by 33 points from freshman guard Matt Morgan.
COMING OUT STRONG
The Crimson went into the intermission after being steamrolled by a 21-5 Cornell run to end the first frame. The Big Red had Harvard’s number on both ends as the smaller Cornell lineup was running the floor with ease while the Crimson could not buy a bucket on the offensive end. However, it only took Harvard 7:01 to reclaim the lead after halftime.
Playing exclusively its starters for the first nine-plus minutes of the second half, the Crimson roared to a 50-46 advantage, holding the Big Red to just six points. During the 25-6 run, Harvard was led by 10 points from junior forward Zena Edosomwan. The Los Angeles native was quieted by Cornell in the first half and only played 13 minutes despite not being in foul trouble.
“They made a lot of really easy plays for me, and I thought for me personally, my mentality was just to go up and try to dunk it,” Edosomwan said. “If I’m not going to make free throws, then let me get and-ones. [I was] just being a little bit more aggressive and they did a good job, because obviously they like to double team and trap a lot, so once you kind of break that, there’s an easy hole.”
The offense started on the defensive end as the Crimson was able to generate stops it could not get in the first half. The team also remained calm against the Big Red’s full-court pressure, leading to easy baskets on the offensive end.
“We scouted it, we knew they were going to try and speed up the game,” freshman point guard Tommy McCarthy said. “We knew we were going to have to do a lot of ball fakes, come to the ball, but I thought we did a good job of breaking the press. I don’t think it sped us up too much.”
NO BENCH HELP
Despite using five players off of his bench, Harvard coach Tommy Amaker received zero points from his reserves. While Edosomwan, McCarthy, and freshman guard Corey Johnson combined for 55 points, Harvard’s bench posted an 0-for-11 shooting clip for the contest.
“We really tried to stick with a certain core group of guys in the second half and ride it through, and it brought us back in it,” Amaker said. “We got the lead, and you’re thinking maybe we’re going to have enough to close it.”
Senior forward Patrick Steeves, the team’s sixth man, has scored just five points over the team’s last two games. The Montreal native averaged 9.6 points per game in the other 13 games in which he has appeared this season.
Junior guard Corbin Miller went 0-for-3 from three-point range in 18 minutes. After it appeared that Miller would take over the lion’s share of the point guard minutes following 25-plus minute performances in the team’s first five games of the new calendar year, Amaker has resorted back to the freshman McCarthy of late.
After senior forward Agunwa Okolie picked up his fourth foul, the Crimson had to resort to its bench once again and began unraveling on the defensive end. With Miller primarily guarding him, Morgan had 14 of his 33 points after Okolie left with 8:11 to play. The lack of stability on the defensive end allowed Cornell to hang around with Harvard, with the teams often trading baskets. When Okolie returned with 1:57 to play, the Crimson found itself down two, the closest it would get.
“We were scrambling there...because he can guard that kid. Maybe I should have just left him in there,” Amaker said.

Unless your only source of news for the month of January has been the series of less-than-science-grounded Republican debates, you've probably heard that 2015 was the hottest year on record on Earth. This might be tough to wrap your head around. With a record-breaking 108 inches of snow piling up in Massachusetts and 15 Hot Freshmen nowhere to be found (sorry Class of 2018), the Harvard bubble felt more like the Harvard snow globe.
In all seriousness, global climate change is no laughing matter. Thankfully, all 50 Environmental Science & Public Policy concentrators are fully invested in the cause of addressing these pressing issues. They may even be joined in the future by some fraction of the Economics concentrators who "are trying out consulting at McKinsey before discovering their true passions."
Meanwhile, climate change has led to some dramatic differences at school. Harvard’s campus is virtually unrecognizable. Students are walking between classes wearing sweaters instead of parkas, shoes instead of snow boots, and smiles instead of ski masks. Even many of the Canada Geese have flown home for the winter. What many feared would be yet another semester of relentless snow and cold has proven an unseasonably mild but welcome surprise. While some may celebrate Christmas in July, we’re currently celebrating Summer in January. High temperatures next week are forecast to reach the mid-50s with no chance of snow in sight, according to local weather reports.
If you’re currently dealing with the post-Shopping Week blues, take advantage of the nice weather. Get out there and run along the Charles River like you promised yourself you would every day during freshman year. Go explore Boston before the p-sets and readings pile up. You’ve dealt with a lot worse, so enjoy it. You never know what February might bring.

Although being away for winter break can be a fun, much needed time of relaxation, many people are excited to come back to the familiarity that is Harvard. While most students are met with the same old same old of their routine, the class of 2019 was welcomed back to campus with the pleasant surprise of a new and improved Annenberg. Annenberg’s new facelift includes several improvements and we’re here to walk you through them.
Marble countertops for the salad bar
Although the contents of the salad bar have not changed at all, the aesthetic that Annenberg now has is completely different. Meaning one that is marginally closer to one of high class and fine dining. Something about those marble countertops just makes you feel more important, and almost tricks you into believing that the food tastes better. Almost. But it’s getting there!
Trail mix bar
Annenberg now has a small station where freshmen can choose between two new trail mix snack additions. If you look closely, you might notice that the trail mix is made up of basically the same things that you find at the breakfast oatmeal station. The only difference is a few pretzels and banana chips are thrown in there, but hey, beggers can’t be choosers. Plus, the posh white bowls on the marble countertops play in nicely with the new aesthetic.
New Brain Breaks
Thanks to the angelic UC Freshman Reps, Brain Breaks in Annenberg are not only longer, but now offer a new selection of late night snacks. Tuesday’s Brain Brain featured an array of assorted fruits, and on Thursday freshmen were blessed with pancakes and bacon. Granted, they were dining hall pancakes, but general consensus leads us to believe that any pancakes are better than no pancakes. Soon to be gone are the days of crashing random club meetings in Ticknor just to stock up on free food after-hours. Sure this may not help with unavoidable freshman 15, but at least they’re providing some real comfort food to boost morale in times of late night desperation.
Sections
A new report released by  Making Caring Common, a project of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, on January 20th calls for advocating kindness instead of overachieving, making college admissions process a “more humane process”. So what does that mean for Harvard?
Decreased emphasis on standardized testing
Good news—instead of having 2400’s and 36’s, you only need 2350’s and 35’s now. Oh, and don’t forget the 10 perfect AP test scores, too. Thankfully, the two SAT subject tests are no longer required: not taking any subject tests will not have an effect on your admission decisions at all. Or so they say.
Encouraging students to be “kind”
What kind is defined as remains open to interpretation. Instead of working on start-ups that no one really cares about, consider using your free time planting trees or picking up trash on the weekend. Not cutting the line while at Chipotle counts too. Just make sure you keep track of all that “kindness” because really, why be kind when you can’t put it on your college applications?
Engage in more family responsibilities
Have you ever cooked or washed the dishes or mowed the lawn? Well, you should start doing that now if you want to show the admissions committee that you’re aware of your privilege. Don’t worry, you can still keep your SAT tutor and your car and your allowance. Wouldn’t want these extra chores to distract you from your studies, right?
Quality over quantity
Want to complain about how you don’t get enough slots in the ‘extracurricular activities’ section of the common app? Well, worry no more—you now can pick two or three extracurriculars you actually care about and focus on those. Or, if you really want to appeal to colleges, just make sure that you’re really passionate about and involved in all of your 52 extracurricular activities. Who said quality and quantity was so bad?
Find your “best fit”
That means Ivy League schools aren’t everything. Some may even say that there are a few worthy schools that aren’t Ivy Leagues out there-—Stanford, MIT, and UChicago, to name a few.
If the Admissions Office abides by these guidelines and encourages students to do the same, there might still be hope for meaningful college admissions. We at Flyby can’t wait to see what a “Nice Harvard” would look like—no section kids? No more professional resume builders? No risk of sabotage from the overcompetitive premed who is crying about his/her abysmal 3.9 GPA? Prospective Harvard students better get studying (and serving the community, and doing chores, and picking better extracurriculars, and being nice) now before it’s too late.

Walking around the yard this weekend and reveling in the semi-nice weather we’ve been having, you may have noticed some your fellow students rocking jackets bearing the Canada Goose logo. Now, we can’t speak for everyone, but we at Flyby don’t particularly feel the need to walk around in “Extreme Weather Outerwear” when it’s 50 degrees outside.
You may be wondering why so many people are wearing these jackets, particularly given the near-balmy temperatures this January. Some may say it’s simply force of habit. It’s “wintertime” so people wear their winter coats. But if Harvard has taught us anything, it’s that we shouldn’t be so quick to jump to conclusions. Could there be a darker explanation for this trend?
Americans often stereotype Canada as a maple syrup-producing, Tim Horton-loving, hockey-watching glacial wasteland. Don’t you think that our neighbors to the North would get tired of these stereotypes after a while? Maybe even enough to...retaliate? Could this Canada Goose takeover be a secret plot by Canadians to make Americans dependent on Canadian goods?
After all, beyond being warm, Canada Goose jackets are quite valuable. They’ve become a familiar sight in many distinctly non-Arctic major American cities, including our beloved Cambridge. If Americans become dependent on these jackets to protect us from the elements on our walks to work and to class, who knows what would happen if Canada were to suddenly stop producing them. Our bet is on chaos sweeping the nation (and a special appendix in Mankiw’s 8th edition of Principles of Economics). So, buyers beware—you may be aiding in a Canadian conspiracy to ruin our economy and take back Ted Cruz.
Or maybe the Canadians just need to get rid of their geese. We’ll just have to wait and see.

The gym was crowded, like a bar in Pamplona during a Festival. College students talked by the front desk. Graduate students also talked by the front desk. College students and graduate students did not talk to each other. I did not talk to college or graduate students. I walked down the stairs into the free weight area. I wanted to use one of the benches, but the law students had overtaken them all. Bastards. They had probably never even been to a bar in Pamplona.
One of the law students saw me standing, doing no exercises. His shirt read “Harvard Law School Intramural Basketball”. He asked me, “Hey, are you trying to work in?”
“No.”
I made my way to the dumbbell rack and started doing biceps curls. That would show the law students. I do not share my benches. As I lifted the weights, I thought of fishing, hunting, and bullfights. 20 repetitions later, I thought to myself, “Stop being so damn sentimental,” and re-racked the weights. Finally, some of the law students were moving away from the benches. They did not have the courage to do another set. Then I noticed who had walked into the free weights area of the gym during my revelry: Simon.
Simon is tall, probably 6’4”. Simon has blonde hair and big muscles. Simon has an accent. Russian, I think. Last week, I saw Simon bench the 105 lb. dumbbells for two reps. I was impressed. It is easy to imagine Simon going to Pamplona to attend a Festival. I have done so many times. Later, I might ask Simon to spot me and help me with some repetitions. Maybe we could talk about Spain and bullfights. I hope he thinks that is manly enough.
“Hey, are you trying to work in?”
“Yes.”
