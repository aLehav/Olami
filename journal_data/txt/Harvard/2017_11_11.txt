After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Katherine Ryan is a wonderful comic and her recent special, “In Trouble,” adequately reflects her multiplicity of talents. However, I would not like to mislead you, kind reader. I don’t intend to discuss the components of Ryan’s comedy that work particularly well. Instead, I would rather discuss a brief moment in her special that is riddled with unfortunate nuance. Not, if I may add, because of anything in particular that Ryan has done. instead, it’s fascinating precisely because it is situated in the mushy ground of misunderstanding by the viewer.
In 2013, Ryan was a guest on “Mock the Week,” a British satirical panel show. She made the following joke on a segment called “Unlikely Lines from a Cosmetics Commercial,” in which the panel of comics creates short bits satirizing the cosmetics industry: “We don’t test any of our products on animals. We use Filipino children.” The context should make it clear what, exactly, the joke is doing.
For those that need more explanation, I will willingly oblige: Ryan is poking fun at the absurdity of corporate priorities—she is implying that the insistence on animal free testing produces a horrifying result in a world of corporate self-interest. More subtly, she is poking fun at the consumer’s blind demand for non-animal tested products over more important interests (such as the safety of children). She is not making fun of Filipino children. She is not endorsing testing cosmetics on Filipino children. She is critiquing the ethos of corporate actions and consumerist culture (witty for such a quick bit, isn’t it).
They say that explaining a joke is akin to killing it; however, when a joke results in death threats for Ryan and her child—as this one did—an explanation is not the worst of offenses. I bring it up because the legitimization of misreading is a startlingly frequent phenomenon in modern society. In the following brief words, I intend to discuss the implications of these sorts of willful misunderstandings and elucidate what the comic can do, and what Ryan does, in the face of blithering ignorance.
The reaction to Ryan’s joke presents a particularly depressing image of the public at large. Here’s a public that misreads, leverages their power to produce mass outrage, and leaves the encounter unscathed and their victim (the comic) in psychological pain. I do not mean to condescend, kind reader, but I expect the reader to put just as much thought into her job as the writer puts into hers. The observer of comedy should try to match the intellectual force that went into the production of the comic’s show—not out of some sort of intellectual machismo, but out of a respect for the work of the artist.
The reader cannot be lazy. The reader is not always right. When we allow the reader to be lazy—when you, gentle reader, read lazily—what happened to Ryan will happen again, “I got death threats, like not one or two, hundreds of death threats every day, directed at me, my family, my child, from people that were hurt because they were confused.” “Confused” is the critical word here. Even though the writer has some responsibility to produce art with clarity, the reader has equal responsibility to attempt to understand that art and engage with it. “Confused,” in other words, is partially a function of a lack of effort over a short period of time—by the reader, not the artist.
The moment that we legitimize the misreading of jokes, as has been done to Ryan, is the moment that art becomes a space where any thought is frowned upon, unless it is digestible and broken down for the audience. Chris D’Elia’s recent special, “Man on Fire,” is particularly emblematic of the problem of bowing one’s art to a lazy audience as he moralizes, “I’m not the man on fire. Life isn’t my movie and maybe that’s ok.” Here, a potent idea loses its power through gratuitous clarity. Do not misunderstand me, ideas and jokes should be presented in a relatively clear manner—however, an excess of clarity eliminates some of the wonderful areas of interpretation that are ever-present in Ryan’s comedy.
The wonder of art is a slight feeling of confusion matched with the appearance of overwhelming beauty. In the moments that you don’t understand exactly why a piece of art is beautiful, and in that abstract confusion that you work, and think, and try to sort out, you come to discover something more than the sum of the artist’s intention. Art should not be universal: Confusion is a sign that you are applying your own mental faculties—your own creative soul—to create the fullest image of representation. In that sense art, or more precisely the best of art, is individualized.
One can—in the face of lazy readership—restrict the scope of one’s comedy. Ryan has not (although she admits, “I could’ve maybe reined it in”). This is the choice that the artist must make: Instead of backing down, Ryan maintains in “In Trouble” that the joke is improperly understood (misunderstood implies some culpability on Ryan’s part).
She makes light of the situation through her craft. She reappropriates the ethos of the joke, tagging it onto the end of a running bit about a Canada Goose jackets and Bill Cosby, “I know that I’m a prick for wearing fur [...] don’t come after me for wearing a fur jacket if yours costs six pounds and you got thirty in your closet because I promise, a child made those. We’re all pricks.”
That’s all that the misunderstood artist can do. The “customer’s always right” approach makes sense if you’re a capitalist, but it does not make sense to an artist with a backbone. She is not apologetic. She does not bow to the pressure of a misinformed public. She understands that her joke was not hurtful and the confusion created by it is a product of incorrect apprehension. With that, she does not validate a response to her art that has no merit.
I hope that, like Ryan, we can all strive to be less apologetic in our art and more critical in our reading: Dear reader, I am not sorry if you do not understand these words.

There comes a time in any critic’s life where he must drop any guise of objective criticism and recognize that his “critical” reaction to a piece of art is purely the representation of a subjective emotion. Only the best of art can produce (and not manipulate!) that emotion. The rest of art—that vast mediocre median—is unemotive. It can be criticized objectively.
I have lost any kind of rational perspective concerning one of the recent episodes of “Better Things” (“Robin”). Its first five minutes are some of the most subtly potent moments in recent television memory. What is that feeling of witnessing brilliance? What is that emotion? (A spiritual satisfaction? An aesthetic bliss?) I am at a loss—my words have failed me.
Its opening moments are so wonderfully, lovingly simple. Sam (Pamela Adlon) lies in bed remembering meeting a man at a friend’s woefully horrid poetry show (“As I counted the bracelets / on my dying mother’s wrists / it was as if I was counting / her pain.”). Her two eldest daughters enter her room and the sounds of their voices, chatting lightly, linger in the distance. Tangentially, there is no distance between Adlon and Sam—there is no line between actor and character. That’s not to say that Sam is Adlon in an autobiographical sense. Rather, Adlon possesses Sam in a spiritual sense.
And yet as I write this, I realize that after reading these words, you, the reader, will never be able to experience the bliss of Adlon’s acting or the luxurious languor of the first five minutes of “Robin.” What is gorgeous is the surprise of it: The satisfaction of an aesthetic sense that, unbeknownst to you, is unfulfilled; the fulfillment of an expectation that you did not know you had. Now, as you watch “Robin,” you will know what that expectation is. It is a longing to have a memory that inspires those bed-ridden remembrances. A reminder of the infatuation of the initial moments of love. A certain fear and admiration for all parents—those that must both build and maintain their own individuality while teaching their children to do the same. I am deeply sorry—forget my praise as you watch.
Instead, remember my analysis. “Better Things” has managed to create—in a show with no male leads and over the course of only three episodes—a deeply nuanced, and more importantly original, examination of the idea of a “man.” The “repressed man” is its null hypothesis. (Both emotionally and physically.) But rather than simply depicting the man as an unavailable entity, Adlon explores the subtle implications of what that means for that man in the real world. In this episode, the titular Robin is her case study.
He throws the aged-up equivalent of a temper tantrum when Sam says that she will not be staying in the same hotel room as him during their spontaneous vacation: “This is a bit of an icepack to my balls.” He only wants to surprise her. What kind of monster doesn’t like surprises?
The archetype being fashioned here—not simply represented, but actually created—is the emotionally repressed sensitive man. (Here “sensitive” is not meant with a positive valence.) It is not that the emotionally repressed man is unable to feel emotion—it is that the emotionally repressed man is sensitive to emotion, hence the word “repressed,” and as a result, acts out on those emotions by throwing temper tantrums. Note Robin’s brooding post-fight persona. Note the way in which his empathy—his inability to understand that perhaps Sam does not appreciate the unexpected—is eliminated as he reacts to these newly created emotions. Sensitive, isn’t he? A similar image of a different man, with the same emotional failings, was constructed in the previous episode, “Rising.”
To put it explicitly, emotion rattles these men severely because it is unexpected. These men do not have the emotional toolbox to handle situations in when something goes wrong (see, for example, Sam’s criticism of her date in “Rising” and his subsequent inability to engage with her). Here the man, who may be expected to be emotionally “strong,” is reduced to a verbally challenged child when those emotions appear. The expectation of strength renders the man impotent in moments of emotional crisis.
How does a man remove himself from this narrative? “Robin” provides a simple answer that is, of course, harder to accomplish than to watch. He, the emotionally affected, must recognize the emotions that manifest inside him. He must give them a name. “All I could think of is that you were taking something away—ruining my surprise like I’m a little baby boy,” Robin says as he names his emotional affliction, noting what drives him to act like a “baby boy.” He must recognize that he is not the master of his own soul. He is merely a passenger, subject to the ravishes of its wily emotional caprice.
Yet this all occurs in the backdrop of those gorgeous first five minutes. Those aching moments of beauty. That brief testament to what it means to be an individual—what it means to be both a parent and a child and to gaze in horror at what they both require. That alone is enough thematic territory for any other television show. Then again, “Robin” transcends television.

Alongside the likes of The CW’s superhero-centered shows, such as “Arrow,” “Supergirl,” and even “Smallville,” “The Flash” has always stood out with its unique and evolving group dynamic, charming protagonist, and promising romance. The show succeeds at staying true to the characters of the comic book version of “The Flash,” but reconfigures the plot to offer an original and inventive take on its source material. It is no wonder Season Four has been much-anticipated. However, although the season premiere is promising, it lacks the usual quirks—specifically, the group dynamics and tension-driven plots of the past seasons.
In “The Flash,” Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) acquires the power of super speed and must save Central City from destruction at the hands of various villains. Barry falls in love with his childhood best friend, Iris West (Candice Patton), who eventually joins his group alongside friends Caitlin, Cisco, and Harrison. Recently, Barry had to act as a placeholder in the Speed Force prison, which is an area that must be occupied by a speedster (Flash), in order to save Central City from destruction.
The season begins with Kid Flash, Iris’ little brother, saving the citizens of Central City—albeit at a much slower rate than Barry. Everyone seems to be miserable without Barry, but they recognize that there is no way to get him back without causing havoc. It ironically mirrors the viewer’s own misery—there is no show without Gustin. Showing full dynamic range as an actor, Gustin is both heart-wrenching and hilarious. Without him at the heart of the show, the first quarter of the episode feels empty and dull.
However, Cisco finds a way to bring Barry back and the action picks up a little. Nevertheless, the ease with which Cisco frees Barry from the Speed Force prison feels problematic. In previous seasons, the writers did a great job drawing things out just enough to produce palpable tension. Part of the pleasure of “The Flash” is trying to solve the tension-riddled puzzles that the writers produce alongside Barry and his team. So the ease with which Barry is freed takes all the fun out of the drama of Barry’s arrival. Perhaps this simple solution was an intentional ploy by the show’s writers to take the audience by surprise with the heavy challenges the team may face later this season. Yet viewed from the perspective of the premiere, it appears that the show is offering simple solutions to difficult problems.
Barry does come back very different, though—he speaks and writes in gibberish, with no explanation as to why this is. This was one of the greatest problems with how this episode is written. Gustin shines in his dramatic and heroic scenes—the comedy set in Barry’s one-liners do not highlight Gustin’s true acting abilities. Although lines like “We’re gonna need more diapers” are humorous, there is too much tacky humor and not enough of the banter that was enthralling in previous seasons. The dynamic of the group seems diminished.
With significant former characters absent—Harrison, Julian, various others, and briefly Barry—the episode feels incomplete. Additionally, Barry and Iris’s relationship becomes too clear-cut and perfect. They lack the usual relationship conflict that offers a realistic romance. Instead, it seems that Iris’ only purpose is to act as bait for Barry. And I sense that the writers are going to rely on the superhero saves the girl dynamic repeatedly, as they did in this episode. It is a tiring, played-out trope.
This was a decent first episode, but it could have used more drama and less cliché. As the title of this episode suggests, this season does feel like it is starting fresh and it is exciting to anticipate how Barry is going to overcome the newest and strangest villain yet, “The Thinker,” who is semi-introduced at the end of the episode. There is just enough to keep the audience tuned in for the next episode. Although this episode has its obvious flaws, the show’s consistent formula manages to produce an occasionally compelling hour of television. “The Flash” continues to shine amongst The CW’s myriad superhero shows.

Despite a tenacious effort from a visiting MIT squad, the Harvard men’s basketball team came away with a 73-64 win in its home opener at Lavietes Pavilion on Friday night.
Though it led the entire way, the Crimson struggled to close out the Engineers in the second frame. Although Harvard led by as many as 11 early on in the second half, MIT held the Crimson on offense late in the game and made timely shots to pull within four with a minute and a half left on the clock.
Despite a raucous MIT contingency in the crowd, sophomore forward Seth Towns made both his free throws after being fouled and, following an Engineer turnover, sophomore guard Bryce Aiken pulled up from deep to seal the Harvard win.
“I thought, as always, we had a really competitive and good game with MIT,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “They play very hard and we know what we’re going to get, an incredible match and that’s certainly what we got this evening. I told our kids that those kids really played their hearts out against us.”
Coming off a season that saw plenty of playing time for the Crimson’s underclassmen, it was unsurprisingly Harvard’s heralded sophomore class that carried the Crimson offensively—in total, seven second years combined for 65 of Harvard’s 73 points.
Leading the way for the Crimson was Towns. The sophomore finished the night with 20 points, seven rebounds, and three assists while shooting 5-of-10 from the field. Of his 20 points, nine came at the line.
“We’ve talked about Seth being our most important guy and you can see because of his versatility,” Amaker said. “He’s a guy who gives you so much in so many different categories. Twenty points, seven rebounds, three assists, he gets to the line 12 times, there’s a lot there that he can bring to the table and he’s critical for our team.”
Towns’ effort at the line would be indicative of one of the keys for the Crimson on Friday night—with both teams in the bonus early in both halves, Harvard would go to the line 36 times, making 26. MIT, for its part, struggled at the charity stripe, going 13-of-21.
For the Engineers, the difference maker was junior guard Bradley Jomard. He finished the night with a team-high 17 points and five assists to go along with six rebounds. Midway through the second, the guard capped off a 13-4 run for MIT with a backdoor layup off the pass from classmate AJ Jurko.
Minutes later, it was Jomard once again, driving into the lane and finishing through a foul from junior guard Corey Johnson to put the Engineers within four with just over five minutes left on the clock.
“A lot of people were antsy on offense and defense, gambling on defense when we should have just played solid,” Towns said. “On offense, thinking things are there. That’s a great team.”
For the Crimson, it was recurring defensive lapses that prevented it from closing out the Engineers in the second half. With Aiken, Towns, and sophomore forward Chris Lewis all in foul trouble late, and the guests in the bonus early, Harvard struggled to close out the Engineers down the stretch. The Crimson coughed the ball up 14 times and often found itself out of place on defense, leading to easy MIT shots or an open lane to the hoop.
“I think we need to do a better job at hemming our fouling situation,” sophomore forward Chris Lewis said. “We were very antsy tonight and didn’t stick to our principles and that led us to break down. It seemed like we would do well in the beginning of the defensive possession, then one of us would take a chance and it would not turn out well, we would foul.”
Despite the defensive lapses, Lewis was a bright spot for the Crimson on Friday night. The sophomore finished the night with 13 points, a career-high 10 rebounds, and three blocks—good for his first ever double-double.

No. 13: MIT
No. 12: Holy Cross
No. 11: Fordham
No. 10: Manhattan
No. 9: Massachusetts
No. 8: Wofford
No. 7: Northeastern

Saint Mary’s
2017-2018 Matchup: Thursday, November 23 at Titan Gym, Fullerton, Calif. (4:00 p.m.)
2016-2017 Record: 29-5 overall, 16-2 West Coast Conference
2016-2017 Matchup: N/A
Head Coach: Randy Bennett (17th season)
Key Returning Players: Sr. C Jock Landale (arguably the top big man that Harvard will face this season, averaged 16.9 points and 9.5 rebounds per game a season ago, first team All-WCC and AP Honorable Mention); Sr. G Emmett Naar (two-year starter at point guard, averaged 5.6 assists per game, team’s top returner in minutes and assists); Sr. F Calvin Hermanson (43 percent three-point shooter, averaged 13.1 points per game a season ago)
Stat to Watch: 14.5: The Gaels outscored their opponents by an average of 14.5 points per game last season.
Overview: St. Mary’s has been one of the most successful and consistent Division I programs over the last ten seasons. The Gaels have won 20 or more games each season in the last decade and should be a top mid-major program again this season. Landale is an All-American candidate and Emmett Naar will lead the backcourt. While this team isn’t particularly deep, it makes up for it in experience. Randy Bennett will likely start five upperclassmen, including Cullen Neal, a graduate transfer from Ole Miss who is a sniper from three-point range. Neal will bolster a sweet-shooting unit that was 39.4 percent from long range a season ago.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
ITHACA, N.Y. — Every showdown between the Harvard men’s hockey team and Cornell promises to be a great on-ice display. On Saturday night, the meeting between the two teams was more than great—it was an instant classic.
You couldn’t have asked for a more dramatic set-up: two storied rivals entering the final five minutes of a sold-out game at Lynah Rink even at 2-2. All events leading up to that point—goals, calls, and plenty of fish—were in the rear-view, as the loud, emotional battle culminated in one last push from each squad.
Heartbreak, however, was the only thing in store for the Crimson (2-3-0, 2-3-0 ECAC), who fell to the Big Red, 3-2, on a goal scored with 2.3 seconds remaining. Harvard’s ability to score late in the game was stunted by a slew of penalties, which overlapped twice in the final minutes to give Cornell (6-0-0, 3-0-0) multiple five-on-three stints.
“The guys [are] very frustrated. We worked really hard, [and] we played a great game,” coach Ted Donato ’91 said. “To have to kill two five-on-threes off is a lot, especially at the end of the game…. We felt like this game was stolen from us a little bit.”
Coach Donato’s displeasure with the officiating down the stretch manifested itself during play. The heated bench boss was whistled for his zealous opposition to multiple calls late in the contest, including a charging call on freshman Jack Badini and a non-call after an apparent hooking infraction during junior Ryan Donato’s shorthanded breakaway.
“We were shorthanded. The game was going back and forth,” coach Donato said. “We had a couple calls against us that were pretty inconsistent.”
The subsequent bench minor awarded to coach Donato, plus the last-second game-winner from Cornell defenseman Alex McCrea, have surely added another chapter to the illustrious history between the Crimson and the Big Red.
“We take a bench minor. That’s all on me,” coach Donato admitted, somewhat defiantly. “I apologized to the guys after. I apologized for the [lack of] competency we saw out there as well.”
From the time the raucous Lynah crowd rained seafood down on the Crimson before puck drop, the building was electric. The opening festivities of the annual game in Ithaca always produce an animated first period.
Saturday’s encounter saw just that. After falling into a two-goal hole, the hosting Big Red trimmed Harvard’s lead to one before the period horn. In the final minute of the frame, Cornell willed the puck past the goal line after 30 seconds of utter pandemonium in and around tri-captain Merrick Madsen’s crease.
After fighting off a heavy slapshot from the right point, the Crimson tender recoiled and hurried to get back in position. A teammate in the blue paint impeded Madsen’s repositioning effort before sophomore defenseman Yanni Kaldis streaked into the high slot and wristed a puck through the traffic. The crowd erupted immediately.
“I thought we carried the play for most of the first period,” tri-captain Eddie Ellis said. “They score a goal, and it seems like the tables are turning, but I thought we stayed pretty composed despite the late-goal going into the second [period].”
Leading up to the Kaldis tally, the Crimson importantly struck first and took a temporary chunk out of Cornell’s morale. The noise, however, never faltered and continued to shake the building.
Thanks to coach Donato mixing up the forward pairings after Friday’s loss to Colgate, freshman forward Henry Bowlby found himself skating alongside junior forwards Ryan Donato and Lewis Zerter-Gossage on Harvard’s top line. The rookie didn’t hesitate to make an impact right away.
Bowlby potted a two-on-none goal after a smart cross-crease feed from Zerter-Gossage gave him a mostly empty net. The scoring play started at the blue line, where a backchecking Donato kept the puck in the zone.
By the time the biscuit trickled toward Zerter-Gossage, Donato’s two linemates were in alone with Big Red netminder Matthew Galajda. The rest was history.
“Henry’s been doing a great job for us since he’s come in,” Ellis said. “He’s learned a lot very quickly and he’s been a great asset for us.”
Bowlby’s strike helped the Crimson settle into the daunting Lynah environment. Once comfortable, Harvard was able to add another first period tally thanks to sophomore Ty Pelton-Byce.
With the puck somewhere underneath Galajda’s pads, fans and players alike had paused the action anticipating a whistle—seemingly everyone but Pelton-Byce, that is. The Madison, Wisc., native kept digging at the crease and eventually knocked the loose puck into the net.
The goal further buttressed coach Donato’s decision to tweak the lines, as Pelton-Byce was also skating alongside two new forwards on Saturday. Both forwards seemed to fit in nicely with their new trios.
Besides the continued growth of the Crimson and its younger players, Harvard hopes to build on its solid start to the Lynah contest. After struggling in the opening minutes of multiple games this season, a two-goal lead and poised play—in such a challenging environment—was a small takeaway from the frustrating loss.
“There’s a lot of positives there,” coach Donato acknowledged. “A lot of guys performed very well under the spot light here, and it’s just very disappointing, and we’ll regroup.”
Harvard, sitting at 2-3-0 after this weekend’s pair of losses, moves below .500 for the first time since November 9th, 2013.
