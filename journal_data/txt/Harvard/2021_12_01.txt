After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s housing system is one enshrouded in tradition: Thousands of students lived in the Houses we now call home before we — or our parents — were even born. The University took preliminary steps to establish the housing system in 1930 with funding from Edward Harkness, who was actually a Yale alumnus, starting a tradition that would exist through the present day. Harvard currently has twelve upperclassmen Houses — nine near the Charles River and three in the Radcliffe Quadrangle, which used to be occupied by Radcliffe’s female students — with these Houses being microcosms of community on campus.
House life can end up defining one’s experience at Harvard. From House-specific traditions and events to simply just eating in your House’s dining hall daily, Houses are a stronghold for community on campus. More specifically, Houses offer connection: They allow students to meet more people than they may have during their first year and widen their perspectives to students from different backgrounds and experiences. What is uniquely special about House life at Harvard, though, is that House communities exist for students to be present as much as they would like to be — just showing up is enough to be involved in a House community.
In a campus that often feels isolated, particularly for many freshmen, House communities build strong friendships and act as a foundation of support for students. From House tutors to faculty deans, the housing system provides students with the ability to lean on mentors and advisors before they permanently depart for the real world.
As a now-sophomore who spent the entirety of my first year Zooming in to all of my classes from various dorms in Harvard Yard, the isolation of my first year due to both the Covid-19 pandemic and the transition to Harvard are sharply contrasted by the immense inclusion and community of my upperclassman House, Quincy. From near-constant events to House Committee meetings to Festas, Quincy has fully involved me within the House and has shown me that the apprehension of your first year here doesn’t have to last. All of Harvard’s Houses, like Quincy, show this warmth to their students in juxtaposition to the harsh Boston winters, making students feel truly at home although they may actually be thousands of miles away.
Harvard is an old school. You live in your House for three years, and in doing so, you are now a piece of Harvard history yourself. After your time here, what are the memories and experiences that will stick with you? What will you look back fondly on? As Julia Casas ’24, a resident of Mather House, said, “I think, honestly, the best memories I’ve made this semester — or most of them — have been with my House.” In terms of how she’ll remember House life even after graduation, Casas elaborated, “I feel like it’ll definitely be a big part of what I remember most about my time at Harvard, and it is something I will look upon very fondly in the future, because the community is unparalleled.”
We are left with memories and feelings of how a place made us feel, how a certain time in our lives made us ache or rejoice. The Houses at Harvard are so instilled within our memories of this place — this old, enduring institution — as they touch us so deeply and for a long time. It is in this way that you find the true Harvard experience: strangers becoming friends, experiences later becoming memories, memories becoming nostalgia.
Although I am still a couple of years away from graduating, I often still find myself wondering what parts of Harvard I will take with me when I leave. Will I remember all of the precious moments in Quincy dining hall, quickly catching up with friends as we all rush to our next classes? Will I remember the specific way the Qube smelled, the cold Cambridge air coming through the windows, perfumed by the scent of old, well-loved books? How about the pleasant conversations with my faculty deans as they walk their dog? As I sat on the grass of Quincy Courtyard on one of the last warm days of fall, I couldn’t help but feel waves of nostalgia for things that I know I will miss in the future, grief for the memories still yet to come that I will inevitably forget as I grow older and time moves on.
To current students: Appreciate your House now. Go to events, integrate yourself in your wonderful House communities, make your Houses even better for current students and future ones. Put down the problem sets and essays for a few brief moments and listen to the waves of overlapping conversations in the dining hall, sit in your House common rooms for just a few minutes longer, soaking in the seconds that you will never be able to relive. Memories may become blurry, but the fondness you have for your House, the way you felt during your time there, will stay with you long after we cede our dorms to the next generation of Harvard College undergraduates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of my best friends called me recently. He was panicked about writing a personal statement for a fellowship application, due the next night, that just was not coming together. His initial query was, “Can you read over it and give comments?”
Three hours later when I had gotten a chance to read the draft, I dialed the phone. “Here’s what I would do,” I said, giving an outline of how I would write my friend’s personal statement. “I knew you would know me better than me,” he said, somewhat jokingly. Later that night, he would send an existentially fraught text, “You may understand, but I forget who I was and who I am on a consistent basis.”
It is quite likely that many readers may also understand. When we come to a place like Harvard, move to a place like New York City, do anything new and large and exciting, we may feel that we lose a sense of self. The sense in which we have cultivated our personality. This may be due to a widened world view. It may be a result of being too exhausted to focus on oneself. It may just be because you do not have to think about it often.
Whatever the reason, it can be jarring when one is asked a question equivalent to, “Who are you?” to come up with no response. And this is the place we may find ourselves in when having to write personal statements, resumes, and cover letters.
Now these items are certainly not the only thing that answers the question of who we are. There are even a host of credible arguments that point to these documents holding nothing of real existential significance. Nonetheless, they do represent some of what we have been doing with our time.
In “A Mathematician’s Apology,” G. H. Hardy recounts a nightmare that Bertrand Russell had once. He is watching a librarian taking down books from the University Library’s shelves and either placing them in a bucket or reshelving them. The librarian takes down the last surviving copy of Whitehead and Russell’s “Principia Mathematica” and hesitates.
Unlike Russell, the kind of dread we might feel when we sit to write our personal statement is strictly preliminary to anything involving an omnipotent librarian. We have yet to write a damn book, the book of our life or otherwise. Even worse, we are faced with the possibility that there is nothing to write.
That we actually did nothing in our summer internship. That we do not actually have research interests. That our passions are baseless and only a product of proximity to problems presented by our institution or surroundings. These are the kinds of worries many students matriculating out of college find themselves having. The kinds of worries that will later constitute midlife crises. The kinds of worries that recent pandemics might have brought into one’s mind.
The saving grace in my initial tale, from a biased narrator, was of course the friend that was called. This hints at a potential solution to our feeling of existential baselessness. While this may seem risky or in bad faith, let us attempt to offer a philosophically sound argument.
Thomas Nagel, an American philosopher, has coined the idea of a “view from nowhere.” In short, the trouble with existential objectivity is that you can never get to an objective viewpoint. To do this, you would need to get to a view from nowhere, separate from your existence.
The thing that seems to offer us hope in the face of Nagel’s challenge is the call to the friend from our opening story. While this certainly takes into account and relies upon the existence of two people, in spirit, although still not totally objective, seems to be in the right direction. An account that is reliant on something external to just a single person’s internal experience of their existence.
The obvious takeaway from this is somewhat simple and overused: Friends are important. However, there is a more nuanced undertone here, that the role friends play is a sort of recorder of the facts. A rememberer of what you have done, good or bad. That you really did do a lot of research last semester. You are qualified to apply for that fellowship or position. Or that your sense of style sophomore year was, in actuality, atrocious.
For those of us who share Russell’s fear of being forgotten, of our books being discarded, we must not forget the preceding step: the writing of the book. We must be sure to remember who we were and who we are. And a seemingly efficient way to do this is through friends. Friends that not only support but critique. Friends that function as comrades but also mentors. Friends that will remember who you are and who you have been when you forget.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
You and every other undergraduate awoke last month to find a copy of The Salient, back from the dead, at your doorstep. The mag, according to its spokesperson, is the space for “independent and contrarian thought at Harvard.” Yes, spokesperson. Save for Jacob A. Cremers ’23-’24, The Salient’s mouthpiece, every associate of the conservative publication is anonymous. Its writers have all discarded their real names for pseudonyms, electing to go instead by titles including Publius, Marcus Porcius Cato, and Thucydides — all Greco-Romans known for their stamp on political philosophy.
As undergraduates who frequently publish our own collegiate musings, we genuinely welcome The Salient’s return to the campus writing scene, from which it has been absent since 2012. But we are disappointed by our peers’ choice to go entirely anonymous, something its previous incarnation, for all its faults, did not do.
Signing a piece off with a byline requires a writer to take ownership of their work. This is why our own opinion page publishes anonymous pieces exceptionally rarely, and why our editorial board — which by design, runs pieces under an institutional byline — has committed to publishing the names of our active editors on our website. This change was announced last year as follows: “While we take pride in our institutional byline, we believe it’s important that our community can hold us accountable for what we publish.” For all its talk of “expecting controversy” The Salient seems to be taking the opposite approach: ducking behind Roman busts to avoid any such accountability for their writing.
Pseudonyms have enabled the publication of crucial writing in the past. The writings of Harriet Jacobs, a Black woman who wrote the autobiographical “Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl” under the pseudonym Linda Gent, fueled antebellum abolitionist movements in the U.S. Many women have written under male names in order to even get published throughout history. The Salient’s embrace of the pseudonym, however, does not promote anything nearly as meaningful.
Op-ed writers for The Crimson often receive feedback on their pieces — good or bad — in dining halls, via email, and, yes, in The Crimson’s comments section. Through only using anonymous bylines, and not even publishing an online record of the paper, The Salient effectively removes any room for discourse between author and audience. How, exactly, is one to engage with Publius?
The Salient explains its use of pseudonyms is “to encourage freedom of expression and attract contributors who would otherwise be too shy of public exposure.” This, to us, reads as self-defeating. The stance, as a previous op-ed argued, implies that any idea published in The Salient is unutterable. Yet the collection of essays, including one which argues that Mormonism contributes to the state of Utah’s low-income inequality, simply aren’t pariah-making, though many students may disagree strongly with the stances articulated. Rather than awaiting criticism, The Salient’s model essentially deems its opinions unpublishable before they even reach an audience, which can only dull freedom of expression.
We also worry about the damaging impact anonymity might have on the arguments made in The Salient. Ample research demonstrates that people tend to behave more rudely and abusively when their identities are concealed. The Pew Research Center points to anonymity as bringing out the worst of our online selves, resulting in “uncivil discourse” and hatefulness.
Salient writers have previously published a fair share of hateful content under actual bylines. Gladden J. Pappin ’04, the magazine’s then-editor, argued that Harvard should bring back a semblance of its Secret Courts of 1920, which surveilled and expelled gay students, to punish deviant sexual behavior again in the 21st century — especially “not merely immoral but perverted and unnatural” same-sex relationships. Two other editors of the magazine resigned in protest. In its anonymous pursuit of contrarian thought, we hope this rebirthed Salient follows in the tradition of these two editors and prevents the pseudonym from protecting bigoted speech.
Ultimately, we welcome The Salient back to campus. We just wish we knew which of our peers we were welcoming.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I cannot speak on behalf of all students, but, on a personal level, I feel like there exists a certain pressure to “campaign” on Harvard’s campus.
No, I’m not referencing all the Institute of Politics and Undergraduate Council candidacy emails that have been flooding your inbox in recent weeks. I’m talking about campaigning for others’ approval and admiration. Perhaps you’re already well-acquainted with the unrelenting desire that so many of us possess to be well-liked, well-known, and well-respected. While students before me have documented ad nauseam that the Harvard undergraduate population is replete with both athletic and intellectual perfectionists, less frequently mentioned but equally represented are the social perfectionists: the student body presidents, the homecoming royalty, and the people-pleasers.
In high school, I was the math club kid, the resident tryhard in your English class. By no means was I anything remotely close to Mr. Popular. Nonetheless, I hated the thought of being disliked, and I convinced myself that if I tried hard enough, I could make anyone my friend. I took great pains to be as involved as possible in extracurriculars, and I had this weird obsession with maintaining some imaginary approval rating among my peers. Every classmate was a potential voter, and I was aiming for a landslide victory in an election cycle that only existed within the perimeter of my own mind. Looking back, I can easily identify how this thought pattern led me to engage in a host of insincere, superficial relationships and, ultimately, prioritize others’ opinions and judgments over my own.
I guess I just figured that the habit would follow me in college, but I’ve been shocked by how quickly life since graduation has prompted me to reconsider what once was my default.
At the beginning of this semester, I, like many freshmen, was intentional about going to as many social events as possible. I wanted to network and make new friends. What I began to realize, however, was that I didn’t actually enjoy shallow conversations with people I didn’t know. I didn’t like spending my evenings chasing down new Instagram followers. And I really didn’t appreciate feeling like I needed to impress random classmates whom I had just met with some elevator pitch of how I was worthy of their time.
For some people, bouncing between dozens of friend groups and collecting a large number of contacts comes naturally. It works for them, and that is completely valid. Though I consider myself outgoing and genuinely enjoy meeting new people, I have come to the conclusion that I would prefer to spend my time cultivating a handful of meaningful, deep relationships over amassing an ever-expanding sprawl of acquaintances. You will sooner find me watching reruns of the Twilight Zone with a couple of buddies on a Friday night than attending practically any party on campus. There is absolutely nothing wrong with nightlife or seeking out opportunities to connect with new people, and rather than criticize anyone for living life how they see fit, I am hoping to affirm the legitimacy of everyone’s unique approaches to friendship and social life more broadly.
I am of the opinion that personalities are kind of like blood types. At the end of the day, my blood is simply not universally compatible. I can’t have a transfusion with any random individual on the street, and my personality isn’t necessarily meant to have an eternal marriage with everyone else’s. Neither I nor anyone else chose to have any particular blood type. I'm not going to contort myself trying to fit into someone else’s preferred mold and demand that I somehow be best friends with everyone I meet.
In the same way, we shouldn’t compromise ourselves or our values to win others’ approval, we shouldn’t expect drastic, transformational change in others either. Asking someone to rewrite their genetic code isn’t exactly fair. I can't expect someone else to put on my glasses and see the world clearly through them. While there are certainly some behaviors and attitudes that should not be sanctioned under the pretext of predisposition, I think the luxury of living in such a diverse world is that we can choose our own friends and associates: those with whom we feel most compatible.
So, please, don’t feel obligated to surround yourself with people with whom you do not resonate or put yourself in environments and social functions that you do not enjoy. This isn’t some wholesale warrant to be a jerk, but, hey, you don’t need to have a great deal of name recognition or be popular in the conventional sense to be happy. Find people that bring you joy, be authentically you, and give up trying to win everyone over.
Do yourself a favor, and stop campaigning.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Fifty-two percent of young Americans view the United States as a “democracy in trouble” or a “failed democracy,” according to a Harvard Institute of Politics youth poll released Wednesday.
The IOP’s Harvard Public Opinion Project conducted a nationwide poll of 18-to-29 year olds between Oct. 26 and Nov. 8, surveying 2,109 young Americans regarding their “concerns on their mental health, COVID-19, climate change, and foreign policy,” according to a press release.
The survey marks the 42nd youth poll conducted by the IOP, which has examined the political and social views of young Americans in at least two polls nearly every year for over two decades.
This fall’s poll also found that young Americans have also soured on the job performance of their political leaders. President Joe Biden’s job approval among survey respondents now sits at 46 percent, falling 13 percent compared to the IOP’s spring poll. Young Americans’ approval of congressional Democrats — who currently control both chambers of Congress — also fell from 52 percent in the spring to 43 percent, while congressional Republicans saw their job approval tick up three points to 31 percent.
In the press release, IOP Director of Polling John Della Volpe said the survey results suggest youth are disappointed in U.S. political leaders and concerned about the future of the country.
“After turning out in record numbers in 2020, young Americans are sounding the alarm. When they look at the America they will soon inherit, they see a democracy and climate in peril – and Washington as more interested in confrontation than compromise,” Della Volpe said. “Despite this, they seem as determined as ever to fight for the change they seek.”
The spring poll found that 56 percent of young Americans were hopeful about the country’s future; that number has now dropped to 44 percent.
The poll released Wednesday also found that young Americans are pessimistic about the political divisions in the U.S.
On average, respondents placed the chances that the U.S. will see a second civil war during their lifetimes at 35 percent and the chances that at least one state will secede from the union during their lifetimes at 25 percent.
Young people of color, however, are more hopeful about the country’s future than white respondents. Fifty-nine percent of AAPI and Black young Americans are hopeful about the country’s future, while a smaller majority of Hispanic/Latinx Americans – 51 percent – share the same view.
A plurality of young Americans – 43 percent – would prefer elected officials “meet in the middle” at the expense of their preferred policies, while 21 percent would rather elected officials pursue their policy priorities.
Climate change remains a strong concern on young Americans’ minds, with 56 percent of respondents expecting climate change to impact their future decisions, such as where they will live and work. Fifty-four percent of respondents reported feeling “worried” about climate change, and 55 percent do not believe the U.S. is doing enough to address climate change.
Views on the impact of climate change, however, are split along partisan lines, with 60 percent of Democrats saying climate change has impacted their local community, while only 23 percent of Republicans agreed.
While most young Americans – 64 percent – believe that individual behavioral and lifestyle changes are “essential” or “somewhat important” to address climate change, respondents were divided on more ambitious proposals from elected officials.
Asked for their views on ideas “potentially costing up to $2 trillion” that “include overhauling the U.S. infrastructure, upgrading existing buildings and transport, and heavily investing in clean energy,” 23 percent of respondents said the proposals represent the “kind of bold action” needed, while the same proportion said the U.S. should be “more cautious” so as to not impact economic growth despite potential upsides to the measures.
Nineteen percent of respondents said “more drastic action” is needed, while 13 percent said the proposals were “too radical” to be considered.
Additionally, a majority of young Americans plan on voting in the midterm Congressional elections next November, with 56 percent of respondents saying they “definitely” or “probably” will vote.
Consistent with the IOP’s findings last spring, a majority of young Americans face mental health challenges, with 51 percent of respondents reporting symptoms of depression for “at least several days” over the course of the previous two weeks. Twenty-five percent of respondents also experienced thoughts of self-harm over the same time period.
Half of respondents also said the Covid-19 pandemic has made them a “different person,” and 51 percent of respondents said the pandemic has had a negative impact on their lives.
Jing-Jing Shen ’23, student chair of HPOP, said in the press release that the polling results reflect the concerns of young Americans as they confront a wide variety of issues, but also demonstrate their motivation to solve those problems.
“Young people have come to even more deeply value their communities and connections with others, not only in contending with these crises but also in striving for a meaningful life,” Shen said.
Though the poll revealed disagreement on a myriad of issues, Shen said in a press call Wednesday that the results also highlight young Americans’ willingness to engage with individuals of differing backgrounds and perspectives.
“That really speaks volumes to the kind of collective power we hold in creating change together, even with such a diverse society,” Shen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
More than 80 custodians, security guards, local officials, and union supporters marched in Harvard Yard Tuesday to demand higher wage increases from the University.
The custodians’ and the security guards’ one-year contracts, negotiated earlier in the pandemic, originally expired Nov. 15, but were extended until Friday, according to a press release from 32BJ Service Employees International Union, the union representing both groups of workers. Negotiations for the new contracts started in mid-October.
Prior to the rally, Harvard offered an initial four percent increase in wages, with subsequent 2.25 percent annual raises for a five-year contract, according to 32BJ bargaining committee members. The union, however, has proposed higher increases across a four-year contract. Both parties met today to discuss new proposals immediately after the rally.
Tuesday’s rally began with remarks from Roxana L. Rivera, vice president of 32BJ.
“We’re here because there’s a thousand essential workers here on campus that work as custodians and security officers,” Rivera told the crowd outside of University Hall. “Their contract expires this coming Friday, and we’re here to say, ‘Harvard, give us a raise!’”
Rivera then led demonstrators through Massachusetts Avenue, around Harvard Yard, and in front of Massachusetts Hall, where 32BJ members and local officials spoke.
Cambridge City Council unanimously passed a resolution on Nov. 22 urging Harvard to “offer a fair contract that ensures wage increases” to the workers represented by the union in order to help them and their families deal with the pandemic’s effects and beyond.
The resolution also noted that the majority of 32BJ members are immigrants and people of color who “have shouldered an outsized share of the economic burden on their communities, which have felt the worst health and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui, along with Vice-Mayor Alanna M. Mallon and Cambridge City Councilors Marc C. McGovern and Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, attended the rally to deliver the resolution to the University.
“We’ve had a history of coming here, showing up, and being there for one reason: saying to Harvard, ‘Come on, you can do better, and you need to do better,’” Siddiqui said in an interview before the rally.
Addressing the crowd in front of Massachusetts Hall, 32BJ bargaining committee member Itelvina Fernandes said custodians worked on campus during the pandemic at tremendous personal risk.
She added that the custodians’ contract extension in January did not include a percentage raise. Instead, the extension guaranteed a one-time bonus of $1,500 based on number of hours worked prior to the pandemic and an additional smaller bonus for those who worked on campus during the pandemic.
“We are the ones that make sure everybody is coming in and living healthy and clean and safe, so now is the time for them to step up and give us what we deserve,” Fernandes said.
Speaking after Fernandes, security guard Aryt Alasti said that 32BJ workers need wage increases that match or exceed current inflation rates.
“I hope that the leadership of Harvard responsible for, in the end, making these decisions about financial allotments will rethink the morality of having contract negotiations take place where you do not, at the very least, get a wage increase that is equivalent to inflation,” he said.
State Representative Michael L. Connolly, who also spoke at the rally, noted that Harvard’s endowment increased $11.6 billion during the previous fiscal year, calling Harvard’s raise proposal as alleged by the union “unconscionable.”
“I just have to say that for the record, it is unconscionable to turn to you all to make this university run and to suggest a 2.2[5] percent raise is sufficient,” he said. “We need significant raises, good contracts, real provisions for justice.”
University spokesperson Jason A. Newton declined to comment on the ongoing negotiations.
Separately, more than 375 Harvard graduate students, employees, and undergraduates signed a letter of support for 32BJ workers addressed to University President Lawrence S. Bacow and Office of Labor and Employee Relations Director Paul R. Curran.
The Labor and Employment Action Project, a Law School advocacy group, along with the Student Labor Action Movement, a Phillips Brooks House Association organization, also encouraged students to call Bacow on Tuesday, circulating a script from LEAP.
In an emailed statement Tuesday, McGovern said Harvard should “set an example” for how to treat essential workers.
“Harvard has an opportunity to be a true leader in the fight for fair wages,” he wrote. “They have the budget to set an example and pay their essential workers what they deserve. They need to step up.”

After an extended shutdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Harvard Museums of Science and Culture and its programs reopened to both Harvard affiliates and the general public last week.
As of Nov. 26, individuals can now visit the institutions in person. The HMSC is made up of four different museums that reside on Harvard’s Cambridge campus: the Harvard Museum of Natural History, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East, and the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments.
The partnership between Harvard’s museums was established nearly a decade ago by former Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith to further coordinate the work and public image of the separate research museums.
"The HMSC mission is to foster curiosity and a spirit of discovery in visitors of all ages by enhancing public understanding of and appreciation for the natural world, science, and human cultures," according to the partnership’s mission statement.
Over the course of the pandemic, the museums continued to offer resources to engage their visitors. This effort included virtual tours, informational podcasts, and a virtual iteration of their Summer Solstice Festival.
Recently, the museums’ administrators decided to shift their programming efforts back to in-person.
To reduce risk, they established new admissions policies for in-person visitors. In line with University and local business practices, the museums now require proof of vaccination or a negative covid test 72 hours before arrival. Visitors are also required to reserve their tickets for specific time slots throughout the day.
Several museum guests said they are very excited about the reopening and praised the security measures put in place for the transition back to in-person programming.
Museum visitor Anna Burkles said she found the timed ticket reservations convenient and said that she believed the safety precautions were necessary.
"Everything seems really thoughtfully done and safe,” she said. “It's nice to know that you can show up somewhere, and it's not going to be insanely busy."
She also said she is glad that the museums are available for her two children to explore.
"It's nice to have something in the neighborhood that is easy to get to and is interesting for them," she added.
The opening of the museum also benefited college students living off of Harvard's campus, such as University of Massachusetts Boston student Mackenzie Cahill. She added that she was able to explore exhibits, such as the mammals exhibit in the Museum of Natural Sciences, that related to her studies.
"I was really excited about the museum being open because I got to visit some exhibits that I learned about in some of my classes," she said.

University President Lawrence S. Bacow penned a letter to the Department of Homeland Security calling on the DHS to reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on Monday.
DACA is an Obama-era program that allows some young undocumented people to live and work in the United States. The letter was addressed to the Acting Chief of the Division of Humanitarian Affairs Andria Strano.
This isn’t Bacow’s first letter to lawmakers and other government officials advocating for DACA recipients. He wrote letters in March 2019, July 2019, Feb. 2020 , and June 2020 calling for changes to immigration policies during the Trump administration.
The Biden administration appealed a court ruling in July that deemed the program unlawful. The DHS’s new proposed rule seeks to preserve original provisions of the DACA policy while also modifying eligibility requirements and the employment authorization process.
Since DACA’s creation in 2012, applicants must have been undocumented in 2012 and resided in the U.S. since 2007. As currently written, the proposed rule does not expand these criteria.
The DHS did not respond to a request for comment.
Bacow wrote that while he appreciates the “immediate need” to preserve DACA as it was originally enacted, the current criteria limit DACA protections to older arrivals.
“These criteria will bar many deserving young people from qualifying for DACA, including the undocumented students currently enrolled in colleges and universities across the country,” Bacow wrote. “To ensure that DACA protections are available to more recent arrivals, I urge you to advance the eligibility dates to include any minors who arrived five years prior to the date of any future rulemaking.”
He added that the eligibility requirement for an individual to have a “no lawful status” in 2012 should be eliminated.
“Although this provision was created to ensure that individuals who were in legal status in 2012 would not violate that status simply to receive DACA, that policy now seems to be an unnecessary artifact—and it has been a barrier for those who were derivatives on their parents’ applications and have since fallen out of status,” Bacow wrote.
The proposed rule also separates legal protections against deportation from employment authorization. Instead, it puts forward an optional process for employment authorization.
“Although I support the work to fortify DACA against legal challenges, I want to underscore that any effort to strike down the work authorization portion of DACA would be devastating to all who have invested in and benefitted from the contributions of our DACA recipients,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow also urged the DHS to automatically extend DACA protections once recipients file renewal applications.
“There is no automatic extension for DACA recipients, which means that delays in adjudication could have serious consequences for recipients, preventing them from continuing work and causing them to accrue unlawful presence,” Bacow wrote.
Bacow reiterated the importance of DACA recipients and the value of their skills and service to the nation.
“As much as DACA recipients and other Dreamers rely on the US, we rely on them — the type of reciprocal relationship that is fundamental to community, civic life, social well-being, and the pursuit of life goals,” Bacow wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Four undergraduates founded an organization this semester to serve queer student athletes at Harvard.
Gabriella A. DelPico ’24, Kaitlin H. Lampson ’22-’23, Keely N. Moy ’22, and Lara Schenk ’23 formed Harvard Athlete Ally to establish a group on campus dedicated to students who both participate in athletics and identify as queer or as allies of the BGLTQ community, according to a written statement the founders provided The Crimson.
“We founded the organization to create a space where people like us, and unlike us, feel free to express their identities as athletes and queer people or allies of queer people,” they wrote. “In addition to creating a safe space, we aim to create real policy change in the Harvard Athletics department and the greater Harvard administration.”
The new student group is a Harvard chapter of the national nonprofit Athlete Ally, a BGLTQ advocacy group with more than 30 campus chapters across the country.
DelPico, Lampson, Moy, and Schenk — who all share the title of Harvard Athlete Ally co-president — said they created the group in part to “revamp” the campus organization Queer Undergraduate Athletes Do Sports, which was founded by two Harvard students in 2018 but is now dormant.
DelPico and Schenk are members of the women’s soccer team, Lampson plays on the softball team, and Moy competes for women’s ice hockey.
In their statement, the founders said Athlete Ally receives guidance from Erin West, who leads diversity and inclusion efforts within the department, and Christian L. Bray, who oversees compliance.
The athletics department introduced three new policy sections to its student athlete handbook this academic year to support BGLTQ athletes, according to College spokesperson Rachael Dane. The sections address non-discrimination, sexual misconduct, and transgender inclusion.
Per the handbook, which is published on the Harvard Athletics website, the transgender inclusion policy allows students to use restrooms and locker rooms and wear uniforms corresponding to their gender identity. It also states that department affiliates should refer to students by their preferred name and pronouns.
Dane noted that student athletes now have the option to include their preferred pronouns on their online athlete profile page.
The Athlete Ally’s co-presidents said they support the new policy. But beyond guidelines, they said they hope they can improve department culture, from “language used in locker rooms” to queer representation.
“While we recognize the concrete progress on the policy side, we feel that we still have a lot of work to do on these intangibles,” they wrote.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Civic leaders and organizers from across the country discussed mobilizing the Latinx vote for progressive causes in the upcoming 2022 elections at a panel hosted by the Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership on Tuesday.
The panel included Florida Rising co-executive director Andrea C. Mercado, Texas Organizing Project co-executive director Michelle Tremillo, Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights executive director Adelina Nicholls, and LUCHA co-executive director Alex Gomez.
The panel opened with a discussion on misconceptions about Latinx voters — a key takeaway being that they should not be treated as a homogenous voting group.
“One of the important lessons that we had as we began to really scale up in our electoral work was that the Latino community is not a monolith,” Gomez said. “In Arizona, you have generational Chicanos that have been here — literally the border crossed them — and you have first-generation folks like me, recent immigrants that have become citizens, and each one of those communities has a different worldview.”
The panelists discussed how Latinx people care deeply about voting and a variety of issues, but may have difficulty trusting politicians after repeated broken promises.
“It is about investing, and it’s about investing in relationship[s] and delivering,” Tremillo said. “In order to trust you, we have to actually believe you’re going to deliver.”
The spread of misinformation also threatens to undermine Latinx voters’ trust in the electoral system, the panelists said. One of the event’s moderators, CPL Fellow Beto Altamirano, pointed to a study by the nonprofit Avaaz which found that Facebook, on average, flags only 30 percent of misinformation written in Spanish, compared to 70 percent of misinformation written in English.
“I saw that in the WhatsApp groups, my abuelita was sending messages about things that were completely erroneous,” Altamirano said. “But she read them on Facebook, and now she was copying those links and sending them to me on WhatsApp.”
Despite these issues, however, the panelists indicated their hope that a political future driven and led by grassroots organizers could help mobilize the Latinx vote.
“Courage is contagious, and our communities are so courageous,” Gomez said.
She noted that when many organizers had to weigh the risk of door-knocking during a pandemic with the risk of then-President Donald Trump being re-elected, “hands down, all of our members said we need to go out to the doors and we need to talk to our communities.”
“We can’t trust politicians, but we can trust each other to continue to fight side-by-side, to have real transformation and liberation,” Tremillo added.
The stakes for Latinx mobilization are high. Another moderator, journalist and CPL Fellow Paola Ramos, highlighted that as the “largest minority voting bloc,” the “fastest-growing demographic,” and “the youngest community in the country,” Latinx people “hold the power to change and mold the direction of this country.”
“These are our lives that are on the line,” Tremillo said. “Our people are not pieces on a chessboard — we’re not cards to exchange.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After splitting its pair of games during the week of Thanksgiving, the Crimson (3-4) returned to the hardwood Tuesday night with a resounding 99-75 victory over the Warriors of Merrimack College (2-4). Harvard carried its momentum from last Saturday’s thrilling 82-79 comeback win over Boston University — which junior guard McKenzie Forbes secured on her go-ahead three-point shot with 3.3 seconds remaining — into Lavietes Pavilion for the squad’s last home game until Jan. 15.
The game began with both teams engaged in a fast-paced, competitive, highly efficient affair in the first quarter. After Harvard turnovers on four straight offensive possessions, however, senior forward Maddie Stuhlreyer’s block on a Merrimack opponent at the two-minute mark provided a spark for the Crimson to pull ahead. Harvard connected on four straight threes at the end of the first quarter and beginning of the second to extend the lead to double digits, 36-25.
While the Crimson held onto a 55-43 lead early in the third quarter, it was the hustle of junior guard Maggie McCarthy that energized her teammates and blew the contest open for a 17-point Harvard lead at the start of the fourth. McCarthy’s dive on the floor to secure the ball for her team, followed by a stout defensive play that forced a Warriors player to double-dribble, led to a triple from senior guard and captain Tess Sussman to keep Merrimack at bay.
From there, junior guard McKenzie Forbes simply dominated on the offensive side, quickly recording 10 of the team’s final 12 points of the third quarter. While both teams traded baskets to start the fourth, hot shooting from Harvard pushed the lead to 20 points, where it would last until the final buzzer sounded at 99-75.
Leading the Crimson on both sides of the floor was the veteran McCarthy, who finished a perfect six-for-six from the field, dished out a team-leading six assists, and hustled after loose balls to secure extra Harvard possessions throughout the night.
“She’s the veteran leader for us,” Forbes said. “She’s not technically a captain, but I think myself and a lot of the team see her as a captain. She’s probably averaging the most offensive rebounds. She’s always the one giving extra hustle plays [and] talking the most. I think that’s just huge for us because it really just keeps us together. Whether we’re playing well, she's adding energy, [and] if we’re not playing well, she’s making sure everyone’s up.”
Not only has the Medfield, Mass., native’s leadership and intangibles earned praise from her teammates, but head coach Kathy Delaney-Smith has also appreciated what McCarthy brings to her 40th and final Harvard squad.
“[McCarthy] is the player that every coach in the country wants to coach, period,” said Delaney-Smith. “She epitomizes a skill set of selflessness and toughness. [...] It’s funny to me, my best shooter [in practice], which is Maggie, she gets five or six shots a game and doesn’t open her mouth. That’s pretty special. She’s just a special, special, special player, and she just cares about winning.”
When looking for what offensive factors played a role in her team’s dominant win, Delaney-Smith pointed to Harvard’s incredibly efficient and voluminous three-point shooting. The Crimson converted 60.7 percent of its 28 attempts for 17 makes from deep.
“Every time they hit a three and we came down and hit a three?” Delaney-Smith joked. “Yep, that’s by design. I’m lying, it’s not by design. But actually, I think subliminally basketball players do that, especially shooters. If you’re going to shoot one, I’m going to shoot one. And I have a lot [of three-point shooters]. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I have a lot of people on my team who love the three. Definitely. So we’ve been working on getting ourselves to the basket, which we actually did very well.”
Delaney-Smith’s decision to include five guards in her starting lineup — Sussman, McCarthy, Forbes, sophomore Lola Mullaney, and first-year Harmoni Turner — spaced the floor and produced open driving and passing lanes to the basket.
“We score the ball really well, as you can see,” Forbes said. “I think we have five people on the court at all times that can shoot the ball. And we play unselfishly because of that, and I think it shows up in this stat line for sure.”
Playing five players with the ability to handle the ball in a pick-and-roll, defend on the perimeter, and push the ball in transition enabled Harvard to explode offensively for 99 points.
“We don’t have a frontcourt,” Delaney-Smith said. “[Forbes] is really a guard, and she’s playing the five. So that speaks volumes about our frontcourt. [Sussman] is in a guard, and she’s playing our four. [Mullaney] plays our three and she’s really a two, and Maggie is anything she wants [to be] really — [she can] play with it everywhere.”
As evidence of this Crimson lineup’s versatility, Forbes competed for the jump ball at the beginning of the contest, yet she also routinely dribbled the ball up the court and initiated the Harvard offense. From tough buckets in the post, transition layups, mid-range jumpers, and four three-pointers, Forbes’ team-leading 23 points displayed her diverse skill-set.
“I said this to [Forbes] when she got here: she's what this team needed,” said McCarthy about her teammate’s arrival from the University of California, Berkeley. “Having her [on the court] — even for me [when] I'm bringing the ball up — having someone else to rely on, having [Forbes], who’s confident with the ball, confident to shoot [and be] a passer during the game [and] in practice. [It is] kind of like a coach on the court, she has a great [basketball] IQ. But yeah, we always like it when she scores a lot of points.”
The former five-star high school recruit’s contributions to the Crimson can not only be found on the stat sheet, however. As Coach Delaney-Smith frequently notes, having experienced college basketball players like Forbes, Sussman, and McCarthy is invaluable for her young Harvard group.
“[Forbes] is our glue,” she said after Tuesday’s win. “I mean, we’re a very, very, very young team. And we’re also brand new to each other. So it’s great having someone who has the court IQ. She’s a coach on the floor. She knows the game — she plays at a pace that calms everyone down. You can see we get,  especially when I put some of the younger kids in, a little frenetic at times, but [Forbes] calms everybody down. Maggie does the same thing, Tess [Sussman] the same way. But those are literally our only experienced players on the whole team. It’s all new people who haven’t played for close to two years.”
Delaney-Smith will lead her young but talented and improving Harvard squad into Tempe, Ariz., this weekend for a pair of games against Colorado State (Dec. 4) and Arizona State (Dec. 5).

With reading period and final exams around the corner, the academic workload for most students has been peaking quite a bit. Here are a few friendly reminders from Flyby on using campus resources to make life a little more manageable.
Academic Resource Center
For those of us elders on campus, you may be wondering what happened to the Bureau of Study Counsel. Since 2019, it’s found new life as the Academic Resource Center (ARC) and continues to be one of the best support systems for succeeding in your classes. Most students use the ARC to receive one-on-one tutoring for a course, but the center can also help reshape your study habits, diversify your learning environments, and direct you to additional resources. And it hosts a ton of workshops on time management, reading and taking notes more quickly, and how to tackle psets more efficiently!
Writing Center
Whether you’re brainstorming your last Expos paper topic or you need suggestions on your latest senior thesis chapter, the Harvard College Writing Center is the go-to resource to get guidance on writing assignments at any stage, even when all you have are bare minimum notes. Pro tip: check when your next essay deadline is and book an appointment ahead of time to save yourself a long wait time at drop-in hours. Every procrastinator on campus likely has the same idea as you during midterms and finals seasons, so the Writing Center’s services are in especially high demand this time of year.
House-Specific Office Hours
You may see House tutors as reliable emotional support systems and constantly ready to cheer you on, but they are also incredibly helpful academic resources. Depending on your House, tutors often host regular STEM office hours, language tables, economics tables, and senior thesis power-writing hours. For those considering a career in medicine or law, tutors also hold pre-med and pre-law office hours, where they can give advice on your application and share their experiences in their respective fields.
Lamont Multimedia Lab
The infamous Lamont Library is the hub of stress-ridden late-night grinders, but it is also a useful place for media production. If your class requires you to make a podcast, video, or 3D model, the media lab located in the main reading room of Lamont’s basement is one of the best resources to borrow equipment and bring your ideas to life. Not only are Lamont librarians willing to help you with these materials, but they are also amazing resources for teaching you how to use other academic tools such as Hollis, Zotero, and more!
Whether you’re a freshman fumbling through this semester or a senior trying to re-learn college life, there are several resources on campus to help you with your classes. The end of the semester is in sight — we believe in you!
