After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
"I will my heavy story tellTill my own words re-echoing shall sendTheir sadness through hollow pearly heart;And my own tale again for me shall singAnd my own whispering words be comfortingAnd lo! my ancient burden may depart."From "The Sad Shepherd,” W.B. Yeats
It is a well-anecdoted, non-scientific fact that the one opinion Harvard students share, whether they be Ec or Philosophy or MCB or theater kids or football players or lone wolves, is the belief that things aren’t as they should be. More specifically, what I have gathered (from talking to friends and acquaintances or reading Crimson op-eds or simply paying attention to the issues that people care about) is that most of us seem to agree that there is one thing tragically missing from this place: Sincerity. Not the Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary definition that you can plop down at the beginning of a paper, but rather the feeling that all of us are hiding something and we don't know why we are hiding it. The implicit promise that sincerity holds is that, once we share whatever those things are and put them out in the open, then everything will be all right, then we will all be broken together, then we can all turn around triumphantly, hand in hand, away from extinction and towards meaningful existence.
Last semester, I tried to kill myself. I was, as the lingo goes, not in a good place, and I hoped that offing myself would lead me to a better one. And, humanity being what it is—the only species that panics whenever it sees one of its own threatening to leap off a ledge—I was held back, by friends, by University administrators, by hospital staff. For that, I will be forever thankful.
I have been told that a good way to prevent me from ever feeling ashamed or guilty of what I did is to share my struggles with other people. This exercise is meant to be rejuvenating, a new form of life. This is sincerity at its core.
What has happened, then, ever since I have shared this gospel with others? In a sense, it has been rejuvenating; it has let me experience sound and touch and sense even when the cocoon around me seems oppressively dark. But it does nothing to remove the darkness itself. The act of telling bad news, even if your very telling is a testament to something bad being avoided, doesn’t make it good news.
The way people react to another person's "deep, real" experiences is amusing. The tendency is to look down, shake one's head, take a moment to stop the jokes and the joviality and get Serious for a moment. Mental health talk is a party pooper, but we can't assume that there is anything else that it could be. Everything else, from classes to jobs to sex, looks meaningless in the face of the possibility of death. That fact is not profound; it's just a fact.
Then, the outpourings of sympathy arrive. The reason that these fail is not because other people don't get it. The problem is that they often come from an emotionally faulty premise, the idea that the way to help someone get better is to somehow affirm everything they've felt and experienced. It comes in the forms of hugs and sympathies, people saying, "You're brave. So brave."
The truth, however, does not lie in how I felt or what I experienced. I’m not brave. I’m the asshole who almost broke the heart of my family, my friends, people who I had only briefly encountered in passing.
Everyone, whether they struggle with mental health problems or not, has the unfortunate privilege of living in a broken world that keeps breaking its promise to get better. But that is no excuse to position ourselves behind a wall of self-pity because it's the way we feel and the way we feel must be right and true and pure.
Sincerity sounds kind and sweet. It sounds important. It sounds (and I'm not doubting that it is) like a massive step forward in a culture that tries to cloak itself in a shroud of invincibility and triumphalism. But behind all of its good intentions, it seems to implicitly promise that you are fine, that you will keep being fine. It justifies the state of mind that led me to do something unbelievably stupid. At that point, I am gaining sincerity with others at the price of honesty with myself.
Depression should be de-stigmatized, and I’m not trying to argue otherwise. But I fear that, by trying to reaffirm others’ experiences, we are encouraging the state of mind that led them to that point in the first place. I am afraid that, instead of taking any sort of meaningful action that tries to prevent unhealthy patterns of thinking, we are participating in an emotional circle-jerk punctuated by patting each other on the back. I have a hard time believing that we view depression as an urgent issue whenever we are content to just talk about it, to treat it academically as a natural part of the post-post-modern “condition” or whatever.
Much more importantly, I am afraid that we are encouraging those who are going through mental health struggles to find truth in their experience, to do nothing else but be happy with who they are as a person. Then, depression becomes simply one more aspect of ourselves, another nice little identity badge, hello, I’m (so and so), and I’m (insert gender) and (insert ethnicity)—and I’m depressed.
Being depressed is not an identity marker. It’s a clear, terrible, awful sign that something is wrong with our world. And, if our prayers and supplications come from trying to affirm the thought patters that are dragging us down, we end up doing more harm that good. We might be becoming better mental health advocates, but we’re not actually learning to deal with the problem.
As a community, we should stop thinking that throwing words at the problem, no matter how well-meaning they may be, is going to do anything to actually fix it. And, on an individual level, we need to realize that the way we feel, the actions we want to take when we are at our lowest, are wrong. It doesn’t matter if you’re trying to make some sort of statement, it doesn’t matter if it’s the only rational way to justify your philosophical or aesthetic sense of living. We as a society have become afraid to condemn anyone or anything out of respect for an individual’s psychological depth. But, at this point, we have to decide whether we care more about not offending anyone (our own thinking included) or about stopping the thing that is taking the lives of the people we care about.
Self-flagellation is not the answer, and I would never want anyone to sink into a state of morose self-contemplation in order to figure out what's wrong with them. But what we can condemn is the desire to record the same sad tune over and over again, expecting to hear something different when we play it back. Depression can lead us to rationalize this type of action. But that doesn’t mean that we, as individuals and as a community, should follow suit.
I am not only writing this to a community at large; I want it to be an encouragement to those who have been in the darkest, lowest places. But, at the same time, I don't simply want to reiterate the obvious: That you are not alone. That's the message passing for life-affirming these days. I want to remind you of something else: That there is truth beyond the suffocating walls of our feelings and experiences. Because those sentiments are completely disconnected from the reality now, the one that is teaching you, the hard way, to be a better person, to be the kind of person who, for at least a moment, can lift that suffocating preoccupation with your existence (excuse the phrasing) off yourself, and breathe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
My father, a sergeant of the South Hadley, Massachusetts police department and a 32-year veteran of the force, is a good man. He is strong-hearted, brave, and unyielding in his passion for public service. He has, for the last 21 years, set an example for the kindness and conviction with which I try to conduct my life.
He is not alone on my family tree in his career credentials. My aunt and grandfather—his sister and father—are veterans of the South Hadley police department as well, and my uncle and cousin—his brother and niece—are officers with the University of Massachusetts Police Department. Another of my cousins is a police officer in Easthampton, Mass., and at least two more, including my own brother, work as part-time officers in South Hadley.
Suffice it to say that I grew up with a heavy law enforcement presence in my home and life. I respected police officers and firefighters (my uncle recently retired after his own 33-year run with the Holyoke, Mass. fire department), considered them heroes, and looked up to them with admiration. On the whole, and especially with regard to my own family, I still do.
But it has broken my heart to realize that America has something of a police officer problem. And I think it’s time that even those like myself, who admire police officers the most, admit as much.
Video has recently surfaced of an officer in South Carolina violently removing a disruptive high school student from her seat in an effort to subdue her, following complaints that she was causing a classroom disturbance. The officer has since been fired for his aggressive handling of the situation. Controversy over who was right or wrong in the scenario has exploded across the media: many say that the girl was to blame for her treatment, and that if she had been respectful and cooperative, things would have gone differently. Others argue that regardless of her behavior, the officer abused his authority and treated her inhumanely.
The fact that the officer was white and the student was black has also been acknowledged as indicating a potentially racially motivated reaction from the officer. Had this been an isolated incident and not dismally reminiscent of so many headlines before it, I may not have been inclined to agree with that conclusion. But this story comes in the wake of a mess of similar, racially charged injustices by police officers against people of color, and even someone as defensive of law enforcement as myself would be wrong to think that no visible pattern has emerged.
From the deaths of Eric Garner and Freddie Gray to the Texas pool party that saw a teenage girl violently thrown to the ground and an officer pulling his gun on party-goers coming to her aid, law enforcement officials are now under the watchful eye of a country harboring doubts about their infallibility. Ferguson and Baltimore are city names that come with harsh, negative associations of police brutality and violence. The racially motivated inactions of negligent officers have spoken volumes about the potential of any officer to cause great harm when given the power to do such good.
Yet the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has elicited plenty of opposition claiming that America is waging a war on police officers. Cops and cop-defenders alike are rallying behind that claim that the Black Lives Matter call for justice on behalf of mistreated people of color is a battle cry against all law enforcement. And I really don’t believe that’s wise.
Certainly, instances of police brutality helped reveal the terrible way that police in America generally treat people of color. And officers exhibiting tyrannical behavior need to be held accountable for their actions. But I don’t think the Black Lives Matter movement calls for a war on police, and those that believe as much are missing an opportunity for education and enlightenment. All the movement really does is maintain that police officers need to be held to a higher standard of conduct than the average citizen, and that in putting on the belt and badge, they have a duty to acknowledge the marginalized status of minority civilians and avoid contributing to said marginalization through misconduct.
This country is obviously filled with well-meaning, law-abiding officers who spend their days making their communities safer. They are not and have never been the problem at hand. It’s those who go about their duties filled with prejudice, anger, and massive superiority complexes that have fueled America’s police officer problem. Some officers, we have to realize, don’t deserve to bear their badges.
I wrote an article a few weeks ago discussing the importance of holding the entirety of a specific group accountable for the actions of a few within it. That notion remains relevant here: placing the blame on “some” allows problematic officers to say “some, but not me.” And so it’s imperative that we hold all officers to the same critical standard.
These are not radical, new ideas. Rather, they’re notions that I once thought all police officers, and those that stand up for them, already understood. Certainly, I have faith that my family members understand them. And I hope that my father, family, and all their defenders would be as hot and bothered as I am about the precedent set by those officers who have forgotten that their duty is to protect and serve, not to terrify and subordinate.
And, you know what, you might not care about my family’s goodie-two-shoes separation from mainstream instances of police brutality. Nor might you care that I consider my father an example of what a police officer ought to be. And that’s completely fair; good police conduct cannot excuse the bad. But I hope you can agree that if America has a police officer problem, then it’s the responsibility of those blindly defending the police to first take a step back and acknowledge as much. From there, the “bad cops” across the country can take a look at the “good” and use them as a model for how to be better; how to acknowledge any of their own underlying prejudices and work to remedy them; how to be more critical of their own actions now that the entire country is going to be. Then, and only then, can we learn from the mistakes of the “bad” and achieve reform.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Recently, Harvard Law School’s Library announced a partnership with Ravel Law, a California-based startup as part of its “Free the Law Project”, with the intention of digitizing Harvard’s extensive catalog of case law and making it available for free online. The end goal of the project is to provide a searchable collection of essential information that is available to all. By any standard, such information about the law ought to be readily available. It is good that Harvard as an institution is using its vast resources (second only to the Library of Congress in this field) as an equalizing force for attorneys at small firms, law students, incarcerated individuals, and the general public. At the same time, this development also serves as a reminder of the general inequality in access to important information, both legal and otherwise.
The digitization of the Law School’s collection of case law will provide relevant legal information to anyone who seeks it out, in a form that is greatly more accessible than what is currently available on the Internet. This will have immediate and tangible benefits from a legal perspective: It will save attorneys substantial time, effort, and money. Similar services already exist, but nearly always charge a subscription fee; the Harvard-Ravel project will create the largest and most complete free digital collection. In short, this project will benefit most those who have the fewest resources and need it the most. And while it is true that the project cannot fully replace existing paid services or place individual attorneys on equal footing with large firms that can afford software such as LexisNexis or Westlaw, it nevertheless provides an invaluable first step towards providing easier access to legal information.
Moreover, the benefits are not confined to attorneys. Because these cases will be made available for free online, the general public, students, and even incarcerated individuals will be able to study the law. Prisoners will be able to research precedents relevant to their cases; students will be able to find a greater volume of information without spending hours browsing through libraries and book depositories. All of these uses enforce the admirable nature of the University’s efforts to utilize its resources for the public good.
Nevertheless, even as we commend the Law School and Ravel Law, it is important to recognize the social context that necessitates it. The digitization of case law is an important first step in making information available to the wider public, but the inequality of access to information in the first place is lamentable. Case law is legally considered public domain—but while it is “available” for the public to read, all but the most important or politically charged cases are often difficult to access and only available online in inconvenient and unwieldy file formats. Even attorneys practicing at small firms may lack the resources to obtain the relevant law to their own cases. As a rule, public information ought to be truly public and accessible to the average person. The digitization effort by the Law School is an excellent first step towards making that happen, at least in the legal sphere.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After inviting women to participate in its punch process earlier this semester, the Spee, a formerly all-male final club, has accepted some women as members and officially gone co-ed.
“The Spee Club has elected a class of both men and women. The club values the privacy of all its existing and incoming members, and therefore has no further comment at this time,” Spee Club President Matthew E. Lee ’16 wrote in an emailed statement. 

The club’s induction of women follows a recent vote from the Spee to invite women to its punch process, which started in mid-September.
Since that time, the Fox Club has also gone co-ed, as officers directly offered admission into the club to a group of women, instead of inviting them to rounds of a selective punch process. Female members of the Fox will help lead a women punch process next semester, according to a letter from undergraduate officers to graduate members.
As students host more discussions about the College’s social life, administrators, including Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, have ramped up criticism against the unrecognized single gender clubs.
It is unclear exactly what involvement administrators may have had in the Spee and Fox’s decisions to go co-ed. Fox Club officers feared repercussions if they did not submit a proposal to go co-ed by Nov. 1, according to their letter to graduate members. Khurana, for his part, has refused to comment on whether he has instructed male final clubs to go co-ed and whether administrators would consider barring undergraduate membership in the male groups.
At least one other male final club—the Delphic—has discussed the option of merging with one the College’s five unrecognized female final clubs. Delphic President Joe F. Barbato ’16 wrote in an email in late October that club leaders had not come to any decision.

UPDATED: November 3, 2015, at 11:31 p.m.
For the first time Tuesday, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences together heard emerging details of what a renewed program in General Education could look like in the aftermath of last semester’s release of a report that deemed the College’s foundational curriculum “failing on a variety of fronts.”
The Crimson reported Monday that in faculty town hall meetings over the past month, the committee charged with reviewing Gen Ed has vetted tentative proposals for lowering the number of requirements from eight to four—plus a College-wide quantitative reasoning requirement—and requiring departmental courses to re-apply for Gen Ed recognition. 
On Tuesday, the committee’s chair, Sean D. Kelly, told faculty members that those ideas had been thoroughly debated at those meetings and that the committee would continue to meet over the coming month to further discuss possible changes before bringing an ultimate set of recommendations to the Faculty at their December meeting.
Faculty were also briefed on the details of a potential recommendation that would renew the program’s Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning requirement as a College-wide quantitative reasoning requirement. EMR is a “special kind of category” that is usually satisfied by departmental courses, Kelly said, unlike other Gen Ed categories. At last month’s faculty meeting, University President Drew G. Faust said that, among other skills, undergraduates should be “mathematically literate.”
Kelly, a Philosophy professor, also said that the committee will have to “discuss with the deans” how to finance a revitalization of the program. Findings released in last semester’s report criticized the University for “a lack of financial support, and more general a lack of commitment to the Program.”
The General Education program has not been highlighted as a specific priority in the FAS’s $2.5 billion capital campaign, which is ongoing. In an interview before the Faculty meeting on Tuesday, FAS Dean Michael D. Smith said he often talks about the review with alumni and potential donors, but that “we also need to get to a point where we can talk about a more specific program” before beginning more targeted fundraising.
In town halls, Kelly said, faculty supported the notion of increased funding for Gen Ed, especially for faculty developing courses and training teaching fellows for the program. Still, faculty were more divided on other aspects, Kelly added, like the reduction of requirements and the possibility of adding a distributional element to the program.
Kelly’s committee was convened in spring 2014 to review the College’s Gen Ed program five years after its implementation. So far, Kelly has emphasized, faculty and students have raised two main concerns: The program— which the report said includes 574 courses in total—is too large and the program lacks an identity.
The committee has discussed reducing the number of requirements to give students more flexibility with their schedules and allow them to explore electives. “If we want students to become responsible people, then we need to treat them as responsible people,” Kelly said at the meeting.
Few faculty raised questions or concerns about the program during the meeting, though Comparative Literature department chair David Damrosch asked for clarification about specific categories for the program. Kelly replied that there are “some disagreements” within the review committee about how to best approach the categories and potential distribution requirements within the program based on FAS’s three divisions.
In addition to the lengthy briefing from Kelly, Faculty also heard an update on Harvard’s libraries from Sarah E. Thomas, vice president of the Harvard Library, who  said the recently centralized library system has launched its own $150 million fundraising campaign.
During the meeting’s standard question-and-answer session, Government professor Harvey C. Mansfield ’53 also asked Smith if Harvard was “bullying” final clubs, two of which moved to go co-ed this fall. When the Fox Club went co-ed, its undergraduate leadership cited heavy pressure from administrators as a factor expediting the timeline of its transition in a letter to club alumni.
“I will respectfully disagree that we are bullying the fina[l] clubs,” Smith said before deferring to Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana, who has met periodically with the leaders of the unrecognized social groups over the past year, off-and-on criticizing them for their “exclusivity.”
Khurana, for his part, said that “over the past year we have invited our students to engage in conversations” about community and that bullying is “the last thing that our institution would want to engage in.”
Smith also said the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest elected body—voted on Oct. 28 to dismiss an undergraduate student because of “egregious actions” and misconduct. The student, Smith said, has been informed of the decision.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Law School has established a program in Jewish and Israeli law after a gift from hedge fund manager Mitchell R. Julis, a graduate of the Law School and Harvard Business School.
The new initiative, officially titled the Julis-Rabinowitz Program in Jewish and Israeli Law, will offer courses and lectures, conduct reading groups, and host an annual conference.
Noah R. Feldman ’92, a Harvard Law professor who specializes in constitutional studies, will serve as the inaugural director of the program, which will appoint visiting scholars and post-doctoral fellows. Michelle B. Deakin, a Law School spokesperson, did not disclose the amount of Julis’s gift. 

“Through their extraordinary generosity, the Julis family has created significant new opportunities for our community to explore this living legal tradition as well as the laws and legal discourse of a nation, which shares the same roots and many new branches,” Dean of the Law School Martha L. Minow said in a statement.
In a statement, Julis pointed to his family’s Jewish heritage and the value of his time at the Law School as his rationale for donating. He named the program after his mother and father and their families.
“I know that Harvard Law School is an ideal place for a full and open and civil discussion of the multiple views and issues in Jewish and Israeli law,” Julis said in the statement.
The gift comes as the Law School begins the public phase of its $305 million capital campaign, which is prioritizing funding for student financial aid and clinical education. Starting only a few years after its last major fundraising drive, the Law School has set a lower goal than its last campaign and altered its fundraising strategies. The Law School had already rasied $241 million raised by the campaign’s public launch on Oct. 23.

In light of confusion about how members are appointed to the Harvard-Allston Task Force, community members have placed mounting pressure on task force leadership and the Boston Redevelopment Authority to formalize the process.
Recent attrition among task force members has prompted a number of Allston residents and members of the task force that were present at last week’s meeting to demand that the advisory body formally explain the process of removing non-active members and appointing new ones in their place. 
In response, the Task Force has asked that current task force member Bruce E. Houghton and BRA senior project manager Gerald Autler collaborate to review and formalize the appointment process.
“I’m just concerned about procedure—because I think before we can go anywhere about all the great stuff that’s being discussed, we need to know what the procedure is to put people in place to make those decisions,” Allston resident Paul “Chip” Alford said at last week’s meeting.
Even Houghton, a current task force member, mentioned at last week’s meeting that he was unsure of how he was put on governing body.
Autler, in response, said that the process includes requesting nominations from elected officials and consulting community organizations to “put together a group that is representative of a range of perspectives” and the demographics of the neighborhood.
“Some times we’re more successful than others,” said Autler. “I would not say that this task force is as representative as we would like it to be.”
Yet despite this explanation, some task force members still feel there are inconsistencies in the process that need to be clarified.
“I think it’s important now to establish a criteria to determine who should be on [the task force]; the criteria used to select one member should be used to select all members,” said John A. Bruno, interim chair of the task force. “I don’t have objections to how the current election process goes.”
Bruno is tasked with temporarily overseeing the operations of the task force, filling in for the previous chair Ray V. Mellone. Mellone has been absent due to personal reasons.
Coinciding with the release of the revised Institutional Master Plan in 2013, between 2012 and 2013 the BRA appointed four new task force members due to attrition, using a similar procedure as when members were first appointed to the task force.
Although Autler believes that current attendance rates are not sufficiently low to warrant appointing new task force members, some Allston residents disagree.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: November 4, 2015, at 1:19 p.m.
A course on Mao Zedong’s thought published by Beijing’s Tsinghua University on the virtual education platform edX, co-founded by Harvard and MIT in May 2012, has prompted faculty discussions on edX oversight over course content.
One of 21 Tsinghua-developed courses currently listed on edX, “Introduction to Mao Zedong Thought” covers how the theories of Mao, a Chinese Communist revolutionary and founding father of the People’s Republic of China, impact and shape the country today, according to the course’s online description.
The course has garnered controversy, with some questioning whether the course objectively teaches Mao’s theories, strategies, and policies and calling it a reiteration of the Chinese Communist Party ideology. However, others have expressed the belief that edX should not censor course content. 
Harvard Government professor Roderick MacFarquhar said that the course does not live up to the standards that a university education should give “as objective an account” of its subject as possible, a standard that he said edX should also follow.
“What we have in this particular class is really inevitably a rehash of the Communist Party line,” MacFarquhar said. “So [the students] aren’t getting an objective study which they can learn from. They are getting what the Chinese wish people to know.”
Kennedy School of Government professor Joseph S. Nye, who said he was unfamiliar with the particulars of the course, said that he is generally opposed to edX publishing anything “highly propagandistic.”
For his part, Professor of China Studies William C. Kirby wrote in an email that he is opposed to edX censoring or limiting any course put forth by its partners.
“If EdX is in the business of teaching and learning in a global context, we should be prepared to engage with multiple perspectives,” Kirby, a former dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote.
Vice Provost for Advances in Learning and professor of East Asian Languages and Civilizations Peter K. Bol defended the course’s presence on edX, though he said the course might not be objectively taught. Bol’s office oversees HarvardX, Harvard’s edX production arm.
“Certainly to call [the course] propaganda is not incorrect...So let’s grant that this is propaganda. Is it important for us to know about it? I think so,” Bol said. “The idea that we would ever censor a course from another university because we didn’t like its content, its political content in particular, is not something anyone at this university could support.”
According to Government assistant professor Yuhua Wang, the course is similar to a required course on Maoist thought taken by all Chinese university students.
Wang said he would not classify the course as propaganda, though he said he “guessed” that a Chinese political department suggested the course’s development as a “soft power” strategy.
“I think propaganda means: there are the facts and then the state wants to fabricate the facts and give you a wrong version of the facts.” Wang said. “I don’t think it’s a fabrication of facts...This is more like telling you what Mao’s thoughts were.”
MacFarquhar said the course should have been clearer about any agenda that it had.
“The only thing I object to is the course does not say anywhere ‘from the point of view of the propaganda department of the Chinese Communist Party,’” MacFarquhar said.
Anant Agarwal, edX's CEO, defended the course in an emailed statement.
“At edX, we support academic freedom, and we do not make decisions about the content of the courses our university partners choose to offer on our platform,” Agarwal wrote. “As long as the course passes our MOOC development checklist and is not unlawful or offensive, we will offer it on edX.org to our learners."
Tsinghua University did not respond to an email requesting comment from course instructor Wuzhong Feng.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard filed an amicus curiae brief in the upcoming U.S. Supreme Court affirmative action case Fisher vs. University of Texas at Austin on Tuesday, putting forth an impassioned defense of race-based affirmative action.
In the 27-page brief, Harvard urged the Court to continue permitting the consideration of race as a factor in college admissions processes, arguing that a diverse student body is “a compelling interest that justifies race-conscious admissions in higher education.” Alternative, rigidly race-neutral policies, Harvard argued, would diminish the “excellence of the education Harvard offers.” 
The amicus brief is the latest statement in Harvard’s ongoing defense of its admissions policies, which have been widely scrutinized in light of a lawsuit filed last year accusing the College of discriminating against Asian American applicants through its use of race-based affirmative action.
Edward Blum, the man behind both the Harvard lawsuit and the original Fisher v. Texas case, said when asked for comment on Tuesday afternoon that he had not yet read Harvard’s brief.
Fisher v. Texas, first heard by the Supreme Court in 2013, involves a white woman who was denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin and filed suit against the school alleging that its admissions department discriminates based on race in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. After the Court ruled that a lower court had failed to apply the right standard of scrutiny in examining Texas’s admissions policies, a circuit court decided in favor of the university. Fisher appealed that ruling, and the Supreme Court opted to rehear the case. Oral arguments are slated to take place in December.
After the Supreme Court agreed to rehear Fisher, Harvard requested a delay of the lawsuit against it pending the Court’s ruling. In a motion, Harvard argued that Fisher “presents the Supreme Court with an opportunity to clarify the law governing how public universities may consider race in the admissions process.”
Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted Harvard that postponement, and parties are currently awaiting word on the extent and nature of the lawsuit’s discovery period.
Experts have said that both the Harvard lawsuit and the Fisher case pose a significant threat to Harvard and peer institutions’ consideration of race as a factor in its admissions decisions.
Harvard’s brief weighing in on the Fisher case builds on statements from top University officials. It explicitly cites remarks made by University President Drew G. Faust earlier this year affirming the College’s commitment to diversity in its student body. In an address at Memorial Church in September, Faust promised a “vigorous defense of our procedures” in the wake of the lawsuit against Harvard and said its threat to affirmative action challenges Harvard’s “most fundamental values.”
Echoing Faust, the amicus brief goes on to argue that the College seeks to admit students “of varied backgrounds, socioeconomic circumstances, talents, interests, viewpoints, ambitions, and skills,” of which racial and ethnic diversity play a legitimate part.
“Indeed, to say that race and ethnicity are the only aspects of a student’s background that a university may not consider would be willfully blind to the continuing relevance of race in our society,” it says.
In the brief, Harvard continued to defend its consideration of an applicant’s race as part of a holistic evaluation process that does not involve any formulas or quantitative cut-offs.
“Harvard has committed extraordinary resources to a labor-intensive admissions process that aims to consider every dimension of the perspective each individual applicant might bring to campus, including the applicant’s race or identity,” the brief says.
The brief also contends that Harvard’s admissions office considers race as a factor in the same way that it would consider other factors like geographic origin, work experience, and academic or athletic achievement. An applicant’s race, Harvard’s lawyers wrote, “is but a piece of a larger mosaic, and is considered only to understand the applicant as a complete and distinct individual.”
The brief also notes that Harvard does not compel students to “claim membership” in any racial group, but instead permits applicants to self-identify their race or ethnicity if they deem it relevant.
Peter F. Lake ’81, a professor at Stetson University College of Law who specializes in higher education law, said Harvard’s decision to file an amicus brief in the Fisher case is unsurprising.
“Harvard has articulated a valiant defense of its holistic, individualized assessment process and why a race conscious process is preferable to a race-neutral process,” Lake wrote in an email. “The question is whether the Supreme Court will accept the idea that any race-conscious process can survive strict scrutiny. If any can, it is likely it is Harvard’s.”

Harvard Medical School professor Dan H. Barouch argued that developing a vaccine or cure would “most definitively” address the HIV/AIDS pandemic in the second installment of a lecture series on DNA at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.
Director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Barouch spoke of the scope of HIV/AIDS compared to other well-known pandemics. He cited that HIV/AIDS has claimed an estimated 39 million lives, a figure surpassed only by the death toll from the Black Plague and the Plague of Justinian, according to Barouch. 
“The HIV epidemic is one of the most important biomedical challenges of our time, both locally and globally,” Barouch said.
Barouch said that while “clearly the vast burden of the disease is global,” HIV/AIDS still requires attention in the U.S. even though widespread social engagement with the issue has decreased since the 1980s, when the disease first appeared in large numbers in the country.
“Some cities have such a high HIV incidence rate they would actually qualify for U.S. PEPFAR [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] funding if they were in Africa,” Barouch said.
Barouch said progress towards a cure for HIV/AIDS has stagnated since the development of antiretroviral therapy in the 1990s. Only four potential therapy routes have been tested for efficacy in more than 30 years, three of which failed and one of which was only partially successful, according to Barouch.
“Clearly antiretroviral therapy is the backbone, and that’s absolutely necessary, but we also believe that it’s not sufficient—that antiretroviral therapy alone is not sufficient to cure disease,” Barouch said.
He added that even in the U.S., ART is not delivered to all people with HIV. According to recent date, less than half of those infected in the U.S. receive ART, a proportion which Barouch attributed to those having the disease not necessarily having access to health care.
Barouch also detailed many biological realities that render the cure discovery process challenging, including that unlike other viruses, HIV integrates into host DNA, thereby making HIV difficult to target. In addition, from an industrial standpoint, Barouch said pharmaceutical companies are less incentivized to produce a vaccine for HIV/AIDS, which would require a lengthy testing process and would be less profitable as a one-time treatment compared to lifelong drug therapies like ART.
When asked about what lessons could be drawn from research that aims to treat and cure HIV, Barouch said that “the fact that we haven’t wiped out the pandemic…speaks to our need to be humble.”
However, Barouch remained hopeful of finding a cure for the disease with perseverance.
“Bringing antiretroviral drugs to the developing world is probably the largest charitable contribution the Western world has ever made to the developing world,” Barouch said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard-wide library system has a $150 million fundraising goal under the University’s $6.5 billion capital campaign, and has raised $52 million toward that amount, Sarah E. Thomas, the vice president for the Harvard Library, told the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at the body's monthly meeting Tuesday.
She said campaign funds would be used to support ongoing initiatives within the library system, including digitization efforts, the preservation of collections, the conversion of library spaces for innovating teaching practices, and recruiting data science and visualization specialists. 
Recent gifts include a $500,000 donation to support innovation in the libraries and another gift to support archiving endangered films. Thomas will travel to New York Wednesday to meet with an advisory committee for the campaign, she said at the faculty meeting. Along with being vice president for the Harvard Library, she also heads the FAS library system and was appointed University Librarian after the departure of Robert C. Darnton ’60 this past June.
Faculty members received a Harvard Campaign brochure focused on the library system prior to the meeting, along with a document outlining recent initiatives and large budgetary savings that follow a multi-year restructuring effort completed in 2012.
Thomas also spoke about other library system initiatives, such as the renovation of Cabot Library and ongoing discussions regarding “cutting edge services” in planned library spaces at a new Allston-based campus for the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Two-thirds of the SEAS faculty are expected to relocate there in 2020, although details remain in flux.
“The world’s knowledge output is so voluminous that it is impossible for any single institution to contain it,” Thomas said, meaning the ability to share resources between Harvard and other libraries is a priority.
She cited as an example a collaboration with Columbia, Princeton, and the New York Public Library system to operate a depository on Princeton’s campus. Planning for the depository has been ongoing for about 18 months, and library administrators will soon bring the proposal before the Harvard Library Board, an oversight group of faculty and University administrators.
Harvard’s library system is the largest university library system in the world, containing more than 19 million volumes across 73 libraries. Founded with a 400-book bequest from English clergyman John Harvard in 1638, it adds 5,000 new volumes every week, according to Thomas.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard administrators from several offices involved in responding to sexual assault on campus explained their respective roles and Harvard’s response and support mechanisms more broadly at a forum and question-and-answer session on Tuesday. 
At the 90-minute event in Tsai Auditorium, attended by about a dozen Harvard affiliates, the administrators discussed a fictional scenario and walked through different procedural possibilities through their respective offices.
The panelists included Mia Karvonides, the head of the University’s Title IX office; Lauren E. Brandt, the secretary of the College’s Administrative Board, which hands down sanctions in student sexual assault cases; Alicia Oeser, the director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response; Emily J. Miller, a College Title IX coordinator; and Catherine Shapiro, a freshman resident dean.
The panelists described the path a student might take after getting in touch with a resident dean, explaining the concepts of mandatory reporting and confidential support; resident deans are mandatory reporters, meaning they must tell a Harvard Title IX coordinator if a student tells them about an instance of sexual harassment.
Oeser described the emotional support a student might receive at OSAPR, which can offer students more confidentiality. “If someone just needs to talk, we can do that,” Oeser said.
Oeser, Shapiro, and Miller said they might help a student attain interim support measures like extensions on academic assignments or no contact orders following an instance of sexual harassment or assault. Miller discussed how she might help a student file a formal complaint.
“If they take me up on it, we sit there, we go through the procedures,” Miller said.
Detailing a fictional scenario in which a student wants to file a formal complaint, Karvonides discussed the investigation, adjudication, and appeals process through Harvard’s central Office for Sexual and Gender-Based Dispute Resolution, which she oversees. While an investigative team from ODR investigates and determines guilt in student sexual harassment cases, a separate body of administrators and senior faculty from across the University review appeals in the case of a procedural error or if a new piece of information could change the initial findings.
Karvonides also said her office states and reiterates that students involved in cases have the freedom to involve a lawyer as an adviser throughout the process.
Finally, Brandt described how the Ad Board sanctions students who ODR determines have violated the University’s sexual harassment policy. Though the Ad Board cannot change ODR’s determination of guilt, the board hands down sanctions after hearing statements from the students involved.
At the end of the procedural walk-through, the panel fielded questions, which ranged from the timeline of the adjudication process to hypotheticals regarding sanctions.
In response to a question from an attendee, Brandt said the Ad Board determines sanctions on a case-by-case basis but would only consider more serious sanctions when a student is found to have violated Harvard’s sexual harassment policy.
The public explanation of the intricate network of sexual harassment support services and investigation and adjudication processes in place at Harvard comes a little more than a year after the University overhauled its approach the issue.
It also follows the release of the results of Harvard’s sexual conduct climate survey, which indicated that the vast majority of student respondents did not know very much about the University’s process. In the survey, 71 percent of students said said they were not at all or only a little bit knowledgeable about what happens when a student reports an incident of sexual assault or misconduct, while 8 percent said they were very or extremely knowledgeable about the process.
The College is also under federal investigation evaluating its compliance with federal anti-sex discrimination law Title IX.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered


UPDATED: November 5, 2015, at 1:56 a.m.
Eight of the nine seats on the Cambridge City Council will be taken by incumbents next term, according to preliminary results released by the Cambridge Election Commission late Tuesday.
Jan Devereux, a first-time candidate for City Council, will be the only newcomer to the body, replacing current vice mayor Dennis A. Benzan. Current Councillors Dennis J. Carlone, Leland Cheung, Craig A. Kelley, David P. Maher, Nadeem A. Mazen, Marc C. McGovern, E. Denise Simmons, and Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. have all been re-elected to the City Council.
“I’m really overwhelmed because I’m a first-time candidate, and normally first-time candidates don’t win,” Devereux said at her watch party after the results were released. “Now I’ve got real work to do, to hit the ground running.”
The results come after a preliminary processing of the ballots and are subject to change as the remaining ballots are counted. Absentee ballots and provisional ballots will be counted at 5 p.m. on Nov. 13.
This year’s election cycle was characterized by the resurgence of slates—groups of candidates running on a shared campaign platform—in City Council campaign politics.
The campaign was notable for the formation of the all-incumbent Unity Slate, featuring seven of the nine incumbent council members. An opposing slate, the Slate for Cambridge, was created to as a means to promote new voices in local politics.
Historically, slates have been a feature of Cambridge City Council elections, largely due to the city’s proportional representation voting system.
In proportional representation’s unique system of counting ballots, votes can be transferred from top candidates to lower-ranked candidates. This transferring of votes by ranking makes slates an attractive option for candidates, as shared platforms encourage voters to rank a group of candidates similarly and pool transferred votes.
Despite the slim odds facing newcomers to the Cambridge political scene, Katy Downey, who cast her ballot on Tuesday, said she had been enthusiastic about the fresh faces campaigning for positions on the Council.
“This year in particular, there are a couple of incumbents whose time may have passed,” Downey said. “We have some new energy coming in.”
While 14 non-incumbents could have been ranked on Tuesday’s ballot, one of those—John Sanzone—had ceased campaigning just days before the election.
On Oct. 26, Sanzone announced he was no longer seeking public office in Cambridge, following the revelation in The Cambridge Chronicle that he had posted several racist and homophobic online comments in his youth. Sanzone wrote these posts on Stormfront.org, a white supremacist website, from the time he was a teenager into his time at college.
While Sanzone never held public office, he was known in Cambridge as a passionate advocate of transit issues. Following the revelation, candidates across the political spectrum voiced their support of the work Sanzone has done for Cambridge infrastructure.
In addition to transit, the 2015 campaign public discourse was primarily dominated by issues of development and affordable housing.
While development has occupied the limelight in Cambridge politics for the past few years, the debates surrounding affordability and transit heated up this election season as citizens called for a stronger response from the City Council.
“Cambridge is rightly known as a very politically astute community,” Patrick J. Scully, the Communications Director of the Slate for Cambridge said. “[Citizens] are willing to engage...they’re willing to ask questions about affordability, about housing, about transit.”
In tackling these issues, Nadeem A. Mazen, the top vote recipient on Tuesday night, said he hoped the incoming Councillors would be more willing to collaborate despite differences.
“I’m hopeful that people will start with a brand new day attitude,” Mazen said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

There are times, especially on cold Friday nights, when the whole exercise of football feels insignificant.
Sitting in the stands, you may feel that you are watching an elaborate children’s game: tin soldiers lined up in formation, exaggerated hand gestures, whispered instructions, and artificial heartbreak.
The real world is full of war and worry; it deserves your emotional attention. But football is a sport, and sometimes you wonder why so many people fill the stands—giving up three hours of free time, braving frozen toes, and neglecting bathroom needs—to watch two groups bicker about moving a ball from one side of the field to another.
Yes, football can feel foolish at times—but Friday night was not one of them.
When Harvard and Dartmouth took the field last weekend, there were exactly two guarantees: that for half the players in the stadium, the night would end in elation, and for the other half, the night would end in devastation.
If this projection seems extreme, then consider the facts.
Ever since the Crimson sobered up from its champagne-soaked victory over Yale last year, the team had prepared to play the Big Green.
Dartmouth menaced as the embittered avenger, the team that filled up seven of the 14 spots on the Preseason All-Ivy Defense but still saw itself as a slighted underdog.
For days and weeks and months, Harvard players trained with this opponent in mind. They woke up for morning workouts, grunted through non-contact drills, and stayed on campus for summer training. And the seniors on the team—well, they did all this with the knowledge that this season would be their last one.
Meanwhile, 130 miles away in Hanover, N.H., the Big Green underwent the same self-sacrifice, and probably with higher stakes.
The Crimson, a perennial older brother, had won 11 straight matchups heading into 2015, including a 23-12 decision last year to hang Dartmouth its only loss. For the senior-heavy Big Green, last weekend’s clash loomed as the final chance to ensure that years of effort had amounted to something more than just another second-place trophy.
On Friday night, football mattered because the adult memories of so many players hinged on the result, and this statement held true before the game even began.
Very rarely does a sporting contest mean as much as this one did.
At the time, you could see this importance in the way that players acted when they were removed from the action—in those quiet moments when muscle memory has no effect, and real emotions emerge in the open.
Witness senior wide receiver Seitu Smith tearing off his helmet after scoring Harvard’s first touchdown of the night. The super-senior poses on the sidelines. He lets teammates pound his chest and listens to the crowd roar.
A few minutes later, witness fellow senior wide receiver Andrew Fischer, also with his helmet off. In this case, though, Fischer is off the field for good: he’s pulled up limp after a long kickoff return, and when the team huddles up for a timeout, he remains near the edge of the crowd, separated from the offensive starters that he’s played with all season.
A few minutes later, witness senior defensive back Asante Gibson dropping an interception and storming to the bench. He throws his helmet on the ground and refuses consolation.
A few minutes later, witness captain Matt Koran pacing up and down the sideline. Harvard has the ball now, but the team still needs a score on Dartmouth to take the lead. With the offense on the field, Koran can do nothing except watch and walk.
A few minutes later, witness freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley holding the ball in the end zone. It’s a tie game, 13-13, but the freshman has no celebration planned. Instead, he stands still as his teammates rush around him.
A few minutes later, witness the entire Crimson bench rushing onto the field only to turn back when the referees rule that a second remains on the clock. There’s a lot of shouting at first, but the noise gives way to silence.
Finally, at the end, witness the blocked field-goal attempt rolling out of bounds and Harvard sprinting across the field. Some Big Green players crumple up, but Crimson numbers are everywhere—bumping into each other, jumping up and down, and racing to the locker room.
Witnessing emotions as real as these is a rare treat. That childish thrill, that rush-the-field excitement: these are not experiences that you can find in the domain of everyday life.
As flimsy and frivolous as sports can seem, they also have a special power to deliver gut emotions. If you were there, at Harvard Stadium last Friday night, you felt a rush. And that rush remains.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With just 38 seconds left on the clock during Friday night’s home game against Dartmouth, the Harvard football team was trailing, 13-7. The two undefeated teams were each grappling for sole possession of first place in the Ivy League, and the stakes were even higher for the Crimson, with a 20-game win streak on the line.
Only five yards from the end zone, senior quarterback Scott Hosch looked to his first option, then to his second, and found both in tight coverage. Pressured, Hosch fired to the youngest Crimson jersey, freshman wide receiver Justice Shelton-Mosley, open and standing just inside the goal line. The rookie snagged the ball, and the 14-point comeback was complete. The win streak lived to see another week.
Shelton-Mosley’s game-winning catch wasn’t the first time that the rookies have played a role in a Harvard victory. On a team where upperclassmen dominate playing time, two freshmen standouts have made a significant impact—Shelton-Mosley and running back Noah Reimers.
Both newcomers have played in a majority of this season’s games, and each has been honored as Ivy League Rookie of the Week, Reimers for his two-touchdown performance against Brown and Shelton-Mosley for his theatrics against Dartmouth. In addition to the last-second score, Shelton-Mosley led the Crimson receivers last week, amassing 71 yards on nine catches against the Big Green.
The freshmen aren’t just one-game standouts, however—they have been consistent in their performances on the field. Over the course of the season, Reimers has rushed for a total of 250 yards and six touchdowns, and Shelton-Mosley has notched a total of 328 yards on 23 receptions.
Their production is even more impressive considering how difficult the transition from high school to Division I football is.
“Just overall, the biggest difference is obviously the speed of the game. Everything happens a lot faster, so it is all about processing things in your mind a lot faster,” Reimers said. “You don’t have a lot of time. You can’t think about what you’re doing. You just have to react.”
Shelton-Mosley noted that speed wasn’t the only drastic difference in college play, however. The rookie had to break old habits to avoid injury on the field, facing off against a bigger defense.
“The first thing is that Mattie K [captain Matt Koran] told me to not cut inside or he’s going to break my neck. So the first thing I did when I got to practice was stop cutting inside,” Shelton-Mosley said.“I used to cut all through the field in high school because guys weren’t that big, but now it’s usually down the sideline. I’ll cut inside occasionally but I always keep that in the back of my mind.”
Based on their statistics, Reimers and Shelton-Mosley have made the transition to college football look easy. Both quickly proved that they each had a good handle on Harvard’s fast-paced offense, making impactful plays early in the season.
In Shelton-Mosley’s first collegiate game, the wideout was able to record a touchdown in the Crimson’s season opener against University of Rhode Island. Two weeks later, Reimers had his turn to shine, posting three touchdowns against Georgetown under the lights in Harvard Stadium.
While Reimers and Shelton-Mosley may have both made a fairly seamless transition into Division I play, each has retained his own unique pregame routine.
“I need to be locked in, studying the playbook, knowing everything I have to know,” Reimers said.“It’s more getting mentally prepared than physically I think. It’s kind of instinctual once you get on the field.”
The wide receiver’s ritual is more specific than the running back’s—and more superstitious.
“I have a certain pair of socks that I wear that my mom got me a while ago, some polka dot socks that I wear under my cleats,” Shelton-Mosley said.“I also listen to two songs, one of them being ‘Fear’ by Kirk Franklin. It gets me prepared because I’m kind of fearful going into each and every game, but it helps me wipe that away.”
But the rookies do share something on game day, the knowledge that their family and friends, either at Harvard Stadium or from home, are watching them play. Reimers hails from Leesburg, Va., and his family has made the trek to Cambridge for each home game.
“Having my family here whenever I play is a really cool feeling,” Reimers said. “They helped me a lot coming here, so whenever they see me play or I play well in front of them, it makes me happy and it’s a highlight for me.”
Shelton-Mosley’s family is a little further, on the opposite coast in Sacramento, Calif., but 3,000 miles away, they still manage to turn each game into a big event.
“My family, instead of coming here, bought the Ivy League package, so they watch every game,” Shelton-Mosley said.“Every game they have a big barbeque. All my family comes over, friends, and they watch the game. Getting that call after the game from my parents just saying that we are proud of you is amazing, and I wouldn’t change that for anything.”

From Flyby’s point of view, Danny V. Banks '17, a Social Studies concentrator living in Dunster, and Sally J. M. McGrath '17, a HAA concentrator living in Winthrop, had a lot of promise. Sally told us that she finds the humor in every situation and was not interested in someone who took himself too seriously. Danny thinks that the best thing about himself is that he laughs at everything.
After the date, Flyby asked why they thought they had been put together. Danny said, “I tried to make my [Matchmaker app] funny so I guess hers was also funny because she was making jokes throughout the entire [meal]… I think we had similar senses of humor.” Sally’s said, “Cause we’re both really, really ridiculously good looking.” Sounds like they are on the same wavelength, right? Read on to get the deets on how their date at Spice went (paid for by The Crimson).
Sally: I was there first.
Danny: I was about ten minutes late. [I had been] doing my hair. She looked unhappy that I was late.
Sally: He was on Harvard time, it was acceptable. I recognized him. We have a lot of mutual friends. He had on a fun sweater…I like a good fun sweater.
Danny: We had actually met before through one of my blockmates because they are both in Alpha Phi but we didn’t realize we had met before until a few minutes into the conversation.
Sally: We found out that we both spent part of our summer in Sicily, which is very specific.
Danny: I was doing an internship at the University of Bologna and she was on the History of Art and Architecture trip to Sicily. And then I also went to Sicily for a few weeks as well. What else did we talk about? Hmm… I’m trying to think about what else we talked about. I can’t remember right now.
Sally: I feel like I’m just forgetting everything!
Danny: We talked about the fact that it was nice to have a conversation with a normal person. We were both worried that we were going to get set up with someone who was really hard to talk to.
Sally: He was super nice, super friendly.
Danny: She was very, very outgoing. She didn’t seem shy at all. She was very quick to make jokes and also laughed at all of [my jokes].
Sally: It was definitely a not-awkward, pleasant experience.
Danny: There were a few awkward moments as there are on any date, where it was just quiet. Also, the gift certificate didn’t cover tip, so then there was the awkward paying thing. But I ended up paying the tip… that was an awkward two-minute discussion where she tried to pay. It was like four dollars so it wasn’t like I was sacrificing that much.
Sally: A blind date wasn’t so bad. I would go on [another blind date] again. Hook me up, Crimson!
Danny: It was really fun. It was nice to sit down to someone…I had never had a real conversation with someone new I had just met at Harvard.
Seems to us like they might be hiding something…why could neither remember more of their conversation? But we suppose this doesn’t matter as much if there will be more conversations in the future, right?
Danny said, “We’ll have to play [the future] by ear in the next few weeks. See what happens in the next few weeks once the October slump is over.” Sally said, “I think… with our friends in common we will definitely cross paths… He did send [a Facebook friend request] like a good gentleman should… I accepted. Not trying to play games.”
Want to join in on the fun? Fill out this form, and you could be featured in our next installment on a sweet date (that we'll cover the costs for somewhere in the Square) with a potential flame.
XOXO,
The Flyby Matchmaker

If you survived Friday night’s festivities, you probably ended up at some point in the line for Annenberg’s “Haunted Hall” Halloween party on Saturday. Unlike previous years, this year’s Annenberg Halloween event was an undergraduate-wide affair. The contrast between upper and lowerclassmen was especially evident at the Cambridge Queen’s head pregame, as juniors and seniors chugged wine and beer while anxious freshmen sipped their “Halloween-themed mocktails.” Whether you chose not to go or frankly cannot remember, Flyby is here to fill you in on the highlights of the night:
The line to get into Haunted Hall extended, at times, all the way into the Science Center Plaza. In a shocking turn of events, someone threw up outside of Annenberg (must have been those Halloween-themed mocktails, huh). A trace of this can still be found outside of Annenberg today. The bouncers at the door were careful in their examination of Harvard IDs. I was accused for not “looking” like the girl in the picture #costumesuccess?
Once inside, the party was clearly divided between those who had really rocked the pregame and the very sober others who refused to merge with the sweaty clump in the back of Annenberg. Among the mass of students were freshmen hoping to *find love in a hopeless place*. A third group of students focused on stuffing their costumes with free candy and snacks, taking advantage of the true meaning of Halloween.
Costumes ranged from vampires to farm animals to SWAT agents. The “cats” and “bunnies” hung out with their multitude of counterparts, while those with costumes meant to be a play on words partied with equally funny and quirky kids. Athletes (especially rowers) were able to come up with costumes that required upper body, if not almost full body, exposure.
Overall, Flyby rules that the night was a success, bringing together all different types of people from the many corners of the Harvard social scene in one overflowing hall. Thanks for making this Halloween a memorable one, Harvard.

I think one of the greatest first-world problems at Harvard is the fact that Chipotle closes every night at 10 p.m. (yes, on weekends too). Even when you run to that far corner Brattle Square, if you reach Chipotle at 10:00 p.m., you can already see the chairs being put up. Pushed on by my need for vaguely Mexican-inspired food plus a habit of visiting Felipe’s too often, I decided to venture where few Harvard students had gone so far…yes, I went to El Jefe’s Taqueria.
The Scene
As I walked in the entrance, located near the Garage I was wondering how it would compare with Taco Truck, the restaurant that was located there before (which I remember getting a taco there for one day and never going back). Would El Jefe’s fall to the wayside like Taco Truck?
The place was very bright. It was so bright that that the only features of the place I remembered were the huge rack of hot sauces near the condiment bar and the flat screen TV. I don't think that is good for a restaurant that stays open until 4 a.m.
Out of the many food choices they offered, I chose a Mexican Bowl for $8.02 (tax included). For that price, I could get one of any meat plus any other selections. They had the usual selections (black or pinto), (brown or cilantro rice) and free guacamole. But they also had items like plantains, shrimp and more. But out of the sheer sake of comparison, I ordered a carnitas bowl, similar to how I would at Chipotle.
 The Taste
Since the place was empty during the time I ordered, I trekked back to my house to taste. Now was the moment of truth. Would I experience a whole new world of flavors? Will I no longer have to walk all the way to Brattle Square to get something to eat? At my first bite, I realized that my food... was cold. Not even lukewarm. I *know* it wasn’t my fault because I had spent so little time between getting my food and sitting down to eat it.
After using the microwave in the dining hall (does anyone know how it works?), I tried it again. At second taste, I didn’t know what I was trying to expect. It tasted technically edible, like swai. But it wasn’t great, like swai. I finished eating just because I didn’t want to waste any of the cash I spent. The most I can say was that the guacamole was fresh by the time I ate it.
Conclusion
I’m not going to tell people to avoid going there, but I won’t force them to try it out. It didn’t have the weirdly addictive quality that Chipotle thrives on. Maybe I went on a bad day but I don’t think I will stop visiting Felipe’s anytime soon. If you are unsure yourself, I recommend sticking to the Chipotle or Felipe’s that you are used to (or Qdoba even, it does have free guac too).
