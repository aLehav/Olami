After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
JOHANNESBURG—The situation was not ideal. I was at the Johannesburg airport, waiting in a cold, bare room occupied by plastic chairs. I had been pulled out of the immigration line for not having my yellow fever certificate: you don’t need one when traveling to South Africa from America, but you do need one when traveling from Tanzania. The woman who was supposed to stamp my passport and release me to the domestic section of the airport where I could catch a flight to Cape Town instead said curtly, “They are going to refuse you entry. You need to go back to Tanzania,” and took me to the airport clinic.
The clinic had handed me over to immigration, where I was waiting to be served deportation papers. I had been waiting for five hours. My company were other illegal immigrants—a man from Malawi with a forged work permit; a woman from South Africa, her Nigerian husband, and five-year-old son; a man from Zimbabwe who seemed to have committed no crime other than leaving his teenage baby mama; and the CEO of a $90-million dollar company who had left his wife, kids, and yellow fever certificate in Zanzibar for vacation and was coming for a week of business meetings.
I had called my sister, who was in Cape Town, from the CEO’s Skype account, and explained the situation to her. I had tried to call my parents, but my Tanzanian cell phone account ran out of money in less than thirty seconds. I was contemplating how I would travel back to Tanzania without bankrupting myself, when the man from immigration—part of the third shift of officers whom I had entreated and failed to get food or water from—entered the room. “I think someone from America is calling for you,” he told the CEO. The CEO left and returned, “Anita, I think your parents are calling you.” My dad had found the number of the room outside the holding cell, and told me that he was faxing “Kenneth” a copy of my yellow fever certificate and that “Kenneth” was going to take it to “Annette” at the public health office, and that I just had to find these people and make sure they kept their promises to the worried father on the phone.
It’s embarrassing to say that this was not the first time my parents bailed me out of a difficult situation abroad—it wasn’t even the first time during this trip. When I was having trouble with my host family last month, my mom searched online and found a hostel twenty minutes away, explained my situation to the hostel owner, and sent me directions to the place via text message. When I caught dengue fever in Honduras a few years ago, my dad came and stayed with me for a week in the hospital in San Pedro Sula.
Indeed, it is embarrassing that I get into these situations at all, given how much I have to report to my parents when I’m abroad. Every time I travel I give them a spreadsheet of contact numbers, for people they can call who will know where I am at any given second. I can be sure that if I don’t pick up the phone for a few days, I will hear about it from someone around me. Even God is being called into service: the other day I found a rosary in my suitcase. I thought this worrying would stop after I turned 18, or maybe after I turned 21. Or maybe now, even, that I am about to graduate from college, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that that’s not the case.
Two hours later, after shuttling back and forth between the immigration office, the airport clinic, and the South African Air check-in counter, I was escorted through immigration and past a massive line of passengers. “It seems that if you know someone big or important the rules don’t apply to you,” the airport official accompanying me complained loudly to the man stamping my passport. No, I wanted to say, you just need great parents.

NEW YORK—There comes a time, during a behind-a-desk internship in New York, when you realize that your only weekday exercise is the hurried walk back and forth from your desk to the shredder in the room next door. When this time comes, you’ll probably think it a good idea to sign up for an outdoor exercise class at the only time you can fit into your schedule. And this time, as it were, is 5:30 a.m.
In theory, the class seemed like a great way to engage in something outside of the confines of an office building. Besides, completing an early-morning workout with a scenic sunrise as a backdrop would appear an idyllic beginning to the day. But when the aroma of freshly baked bread from the local bakery that I know to be miles away permeates the air and disrupts my concentration during the fifth round of push-ups, the deceptively simple class quickly becomes more torturous than energizing.
After the first day, it was impossible to separate workout from work. Using stairs required a special strategy to ensure that the least possible amount of pressure was applied on sore, throbbing legs. Laughing, coughing, and every minor pivot of the torso was inconceivable without stabbing pains on both sides, and even minor tasks required careful planning so as not to overexert already aching muscles.
“This isn’t a spectator sport,” said the instructor in response to the class’ reluctance to push themselves well past their comfort zones and dive wholeheartedly into each new exercise. At the time, the statement felt more like a cutting remark than an impetus to action. Three days later, however, my muscle soreness dwindled from an all-consuming presence to a dull ache, and the instructor’s comment served more to remind me of the fact that I had paid for the class, and that in that hour there’s really nothing else to do but stick it out.

BERLIN—A taste for salmiak is determined primarily by geography and age. If you are not from northern Germany, the Netherlands, the Nordic countries, or the Baltic states, you probably will not like the taste of the salty licorice candy. Its deceptive initial sweetness explodes into the very salty, smoky, inky, almost-stinging flavor of the sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride that gives salmiak both its name and palpable chemical bouquet.
Most kids don’t like the taste, but many grow up to be self-proclaimed addicts or casual consumers of salmiak. “It’s something you either love or hate,” the Finnish students I met at a hostel in Frankfurt told me, “You really have to try it if you are ever in Finland.”
Salmiak is available in many shapes: soft-chew, gummy, hard candy, pastille, ensconced in a cloak of sugar, liquefied as chocolate bar filling or as alcoholic drink. Salmiak was also available in vending machines at the train station I stopped at in Holland.
When I bit into my first marble of salmiak, my tongue burned from the sharp saltiness and the back of my nose felt as if it had been struck by a mixture of fermented stingray meat and Windex. Did I like it? Did I not like it? My palate was so flabbergasted that I couldn’t tell. So I had another one, and then another until I could imagine how, exactly, salmiak could be branded “delicious.”
Acquiring a taste for a regional culinary specialty can be like acclimating to a new culture—it’s not easy, and it happens over the course of lifetimes, if not generations. To the uninitiated, a new taste, like the sal ammoniac in salmiak, is so strong as to be physically overwhelming and unlikeable due to its very foreignness. Often people, after trying salmiak for the first time, will spit it back out onto their palms or briskly destroy it in their jaws with a polite grimace.
And it shouldn’t be taken for granted that everyone in salmiak-territory likes or eats salmiak. Some people, like the Swedish and Dutch students I met in Berlin, eat salmiak occasionally but do not care much for it.
Similar to many beloved confections, the pleasures of salmiak can be treacherous. It is recommended that people with high blood pressure refrain from consuming large qualities of this treat which, for the adventurous and appropriately healthy, is available in the United States under the alias “Dutch double salt licorice.”

DONGGUAN, China—Ever since my first day here, when I vastly overestimated the amount of time I could spend talking with a group of 10-year-old Chinese kids about their favorite foods despite my not speaking Mandarin and their not speaking English, ten minutes of basketball every hour has become an integral part of my lesson plan. Every morning, I am greeted with “Teacher! Teacher! When we play basketball?” The most rambunctious of my eleven students, the bespectacled Martin from Guangzhou, waits for my answer in excited anticipation.
Admittedly, the quality of the game on the court outside the schoolhouse has room for improvement. Martin’s jump shot involves no jump, and the one-armed hurl he makes when throwing the ball at the net barely resembles a shot. There are some eccentricities in the rule book, too: Rule #1—“Teacher Alex doesn’t take a break,” and Rule #2 –“Teacher Alex doesn’t shoot.” But the kids’ love for the game is as genuine as you’ll find on any hard top in America.
NBA Commissioner David Stern would have you believe that basketball’s increasing popularity in what many call the last large untapped market is due to his own concerted efforts to market the game to a Chinese audience. I’m not sure if he’s right. Sure, last weekend I enjoyed a bottle of Tsingtao beer that had the NBA logo on its label, but my students’ knowledge of the NBA lags far behind their ability to run an effective transition offense (damn right I’ve taught them how to run a transition offense). When I went through a list of prominent NBA stars, the only one that rang a bell with any of the kids was Yao Ming and that, well, is because he’s Chinese. What did seem to register was that, when compared to the Boston Celtics’ 17 championship wins, my own Seattle Sonics’single championship is, in their words, “very, very sad.” I neglected to mention the fact that the Sonics no longer exist; one can only imagine what one of my students, Shine, would think of that.
Though I genuinely believe, or at the very least hope, that the many hours I spend in the classroom with the kids are actually improving their English, I must admit that I spend much of the time asking my students if they have understood what I’ve just said. More often than not, I’m met with blank, somewhat judgmental stares. But five times a day, for ten minutes each, I know that my kids are learning something. I know that Jack made five free throws in a row last Thursday, I know that Betty learned how to dribble and that Lily learned how to bounce pass.
Last week my class—class 6—played against class 7 in a friendly basketball game. Shine, Martin, Jack, and the crew won 24-0. Though they can’t understand this article now, hopefully one day they’ll be able to read it and others, and they’ll know that I’m proud of them. Tomorrow’s lesson: sportsmanship.

WASHINGTON—It was a little after midnight on a Saturday night when I boarded the metro and headed on the Red Line towards home.
At first, I didn’t notice anything unusual about the metro car. The passengers were what one might expect from the Saturday night crowd: some huddled in groups, chatty and likely returning from a party, others sitting by themselves, looking a little tired.
Then, it hit me. There was music. Loud music. I spun around and noticed the gigantic boom box that a young man had set down on the seat next to him. It was rectangular and portable, with a handle and complicated-looking controls, big enough to fill up the horizontal space of the whole seat.
Within moments, Eurythmics filled the car. We all looked toward the boom box and the young man, who was tapping his foot in time with the music.
A sequence of 80s hits followed. As the next song came on, a scruffy man with his feet up on the adjacent seat began to clap. Slowly, more people joined him. By the end, about 20 people in the car were clapping in unison to the beat of the music, smiling and laughing. A girl standing by the door did a little dance.
This was not the same Metro I ride in the mornings, when passengers sleep or read in silence, avoiding eye contact. In that Metro, the scraping noise of the train passing through the cars is the only sound to be heard. This Metro had come alive. The music had changed the car. However briefly, it had become a community, and people were having fun together.
“Good job, man,” a passenger told the young man with the boom box, trading a fist bump as he got off at his stop. Others gave the young man approving nods or a smile as they left. And the party Metro car went on.

PADUA, Italy—When I learned that Elton John would be playing in Padua, I wasted little time in buying a ticket. I wasn’t going to miss seeing the legend in action.
A friend and I thought through the logistics. Getting to the concert would be easy. In true European fashion, it started at 9:30 p.m., so we planned to take a train from Venice to Padua and find our way to the venue. As for getting back, we weren’t too concerned: we would make sure to grab a cab around midnight in time to catch the 12:41 a.m. train, the last one out of Padua for the night. We wanted to be sure to make that final train: if we didn’t, we would be forced to spend the night at the sketchy Padua train station and wouldn’t be back in Venice until 6 a.m.
On the day of the concert, everything began according to plan. Once we arrived at the Padua train station, we quickly grabbed a taxi to Piazzola sul Brenta, the concert site.
But it wasn’t as expected—the venue was located well outside of Padua, a good 20-25 minute drive. And we weren’t exactly driving through civilization. As a California boy, the only time I had ever seen so many cornfields was while watching “Field of Dreams.”
After the taxi dropped us off, we made our way to our seats. Elton came on stage three minutes early, and as predicted, rocked until the end.
And that was where our plans began to fall apart.
There were no cabs anywhere. Not a single one. My watch read 12:00 a.m., meaning, realistically, that we had 20 minutes to catch a cab if we had any hope of making the 12:41 train. Frantically, I began to call taxi services. No one answered—or they did, only to hang up when my atrocious Italian skills became clear.
We had three options. First, we could hitchhike back to the station, as my friend suggested. I quickly shot this one down. Second, we could walk the eight miles back to the train station, sleep there, and get back to Venice at 6 a.m. I rejected this plan as well. I knew that somewhere, walking all night through Italian cornfields, we would take a wrong turn and end up in Middle Earth.
So we took the third route: continue calling cabs. At first, our luck showed few signs of turning. Finally, as we passed a drink kiosk, an Italian man offered us a Coke in English. This was our chance: I told him that I would call the cab company’s number if he would tell the cabbie our location. He agreed, and after talking with the cabbie for a few minutes, told us to wait near the bank down the road. The taxi would be there in 20 minutes, he promised.
The time was 12:38 a.m. Hopes of catching the 12:41 train had long since vanished. Now we just wanted to get back to civilization.
We waited. Shops began to close. If this cab didn’t show, we were going to have to trek back to Padua. I could feel my blood pressure rising. 12:58 came along, and still no cab. I began to plead with people at the now-closing stores, asking for directions, help on the phone—something.
And then, out of the mist, I saw the little “Taxi” light approaching. With a huge sigh of relief, I ran toward it and hopped in. And the two of us, realizing that it wasn’t that much further to drive back to Venice, had the cab driver do just that. Sure, it made quite a dent in the travel budget, but it was well worth the trade.

BRASILIA, Brazil—In Brasília, there are no crowds, no congestion. Skyscrapers are forbidden and buildings are spread out. Major roads and neighborhoods have no names—they are numbered one, two, east, west. The city is partitioned into districts defined by their function: residential, commercial, political, touristic.
In Brasília, everything is perfect—and right from the start, I hate it.
Driving into the heart of Brazil’s capital, what first strikes me is the city’s serenity—a serenity only recently planned, built, and cultivated. It’s easy for me to see how there was nothing here before 1955. Monuments and ministries flank the Via 2 Sul but their whitewashed concrete makes them look like bleached Legos, interchangeable and transitory, ready to be picked up and tinkered with at anyone’s whim.
“Brasília,” says our petite half-Japanese tour guide in hushed tones of awe, “was the first city built not at random or around a strategy but on a philosophy.” She pauses: “Modernism!”
Then-president Juscelino Kubitschek was a fan of everything to do with the movement, she continues, from the sleek lines of its architecture to the progressiveness of its politics. In its broadest sense, modernism meant modernity for Kubitschek, who wanted a capital for his country that would shatter the stereotypes of a backwards Brazil and launch it onto the world stage.
Hence the monuments and the ministries, each built in strict adherence to the tenets of modernist architecture, and the partitioned districts, enforcing an artificial equality among Brasilia’s inhabitants. Hence the wide-open boulevards and swaths of nothing, because “human beings,” our guide claims, “have a necessity of space, to think and to progress”—and it’s OK if that means everything should be far apart. After all, you have to rely on automobiles and oil to acclimate to a modern world, a world in which the Brazilian economy, at least, is playing an increasingly important role.
And while the trip itself is fascinating, I still don’t like the city. It’s too tidy. It’s too pristine. When we descend a hill to visit the Congresso Nacional, the three roads leading to the entrance are lined by a succession of politicians’ cars, each one flawlessly parallel-parked. How do they do that?
Returning to São Paulo, my home base for the summer, I find that I’ve missed the honking and swearing and adrenaline-fueled driving, the high-rises next to botecas next to banks, the street vendors peddling their coxinhas and pipoca for two reais each. São Paulo is hardly the ideal city, and when I’m stuck in a hopeless traffic jam with pollution shrouding the streets and shiny new skyscrapers casting shadows over the shantytowns next door, I can see where Kubitschek was coming from in his grand scheme to start from scratch.
But it’s just these nuisances, these flaws, that keep me invested in São Paulo. There’s something to be said for hanging onto its inconsistencies rather than abandoning them to start again.
I understand Brasilia’s longing to stamp out the imperfections of the country it governs. But I agree with Italo Calvino when he wrote that cities should be made, like dreams, of desires and fears, not to be neutralized with sterility, but rather to reflect the people of which they are composed. “Sem graça,” my host family says about Brasília when we talk about it at dinner. I look this up later to find that it means tasteless, bland. But I understand somehow from the literal translation—“without grace”—and realize that this is what I’m looking for and what I find in cities like São Paulo. It’s in flawed cities, the cities I love: a certain type of grace.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
A letter signed by a group of prominent academics lambasts Harvard and the media for the role they played in the investigation of former Harvard psychology professor Marc D. Hauser.
“[The investigation] has a distinctive ring of McCarthysim, and all the toxic implications of that witch-hunting era,” the authors of the letter write.
The letter—which was signed by MIT Linguistics Professor Noam Chomsky, one of Hauser’s mentors—criticizes the scope of the inquiry into Hauser’s research, the media frenzy that followed the release of Harvard’s findings, and insinuations that Hauser’s body of work has been thrown into question by the investigation.
Quoting a scientist who says Harvard trespassed against “elementary principles of natural justice,” the letter says that after the investigation into Hauser’s work researchers should now fear an “inquisitorial method that abolishes the scientific method.”
Eight academics from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Brazil signed the letter, including Harvard Professor of Molecular and Cellular Biology Florian Engert. It has been circulated among top academics.
The Crimson obtained a copy of the letter—titled “Could the Process of Investigating Scientific Misconduct Undermine Scientific Inquiry?”—from the authors.
Following allegations that Hauser falsified research data, a three-year investigation into Hauser’s research found him “solely responsible for eight counts of scientific misconduct,” Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith wrote in a letter last August. Reports attributed the source of those allegations to his graduate students.
In the fallout from the investigation, Hauser took a year-long leave of absence, was then barred from teaching for another year, and ultimately resigned from his tenured position this summer.
The letter condemns Harvard for seizing what the academics see as an excessively wide array of documents from Hauser’s lab, ranging from emails to financial documents. Such an action, the academics argue, represents a violation of free scientific inquiry.
The authors take particular umbrage with the seizure of unpublished research, saying that it should not have been included in the research misconduct investigation. Five of the eight counts of scientific misconduct in Hauser’s work were found in unpublished work.
“Every scientist […] and every student considering entering into science, should greatly fear an environment in which every unpublished fragment of research, every financial record, is open to scrutiny by university officials and government investigators,” the authors write.
When asked to comment on the letter, FAS spokesperson Jeff Neal referred back to Smith’s letter last August, in which he wrote that the investigation “was governed by our long-standing policies on professional conduct and shaped by the regulations of federal funding agencies.”
Federal law requires universities to take “all reasonable and practical steps to obtain custody of all the research records and evidence needed to conduct the research misconduct proceeding” when the research is funded by federal grants.
The relevant law defines “research misconduct” as fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in “proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting research results.” The regulations do not distinguish between published and unpublished work, and it is unclear whether Harvard seized such a wide variety of materials because federal guidelines compelled it to do so.
Smith’s August 2010 letter represents Harvard’s most comprehensive public disclosure about the Hauser investigation but still leaves questions about the exact nature of the misconduct unanswered.
While the authors of the study praise Harvard’s insistence on preserving confidentiality—calling it a “well-justified, codified policy”—they criticize a “headline-hungry media” for perpetuating unfounded gossip about Hauser and his body of work.
The authors argue that a charge of fabrication in any of three published studies is “curious” because, according to Harvard, the experiments for the studies were “designed and conducted,” implying that they must have taken place. They also say that it is “curious” to find Hauser “solely responsible” for misconduct because in two of the studies he did not collect or code the data himself.
The letter argues that “it would be impossible… for [Hauser] to micromanage all experiments, verifying all details,” but acknowledges that since Hauser was a principal investigator in these studies, he is ultimately responsible for the work coming out of his lab.
Much of Hauser’s research involves the observation of primates’ responses to various stimuli. Based on those responses, Hauser has drawn conclusions on their ability to understand language, a method that critics say is prone to observer bias.
The authors of the letter accuse critics of exploiting media attention on the issue to cast doubt on Hauser’s entire body of work. These claims, according to the letter, “are patently absurd and should offend all researchers by reducing science from an (imperfect) form for rational inquiry and assessment to a kangaroo court.”
Hauser’s studies have been “numerously, diversely, and robustly replicated ... both by his lab and others,” the letter says. Furthermore, the authors cite generations of young scientists who have studied under Hauser as a sign that Hauser himself was a “productive” scientist.
“Would they be so esteemed and able to replicate and extend their mentor’s work if they had trained under a regime of fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism?” the letter asks. “Is it rational to believe that Hauser is the godfather of a secret international cartel for scientific fraud?”
Bennett G. Galef Jr, an emeritus professor of psychology at McMaster University, reviewed Harvard’s evidence for misconduct in the three published cases for Hauser and his lawyers, and the authors quote from personal correspondence with Galef that casts doubt on the University’s findings.
“In my opinion there is nothing in the charges and data relating to the three published articles to show Hauser guilty of anything. Rather, what I saw on numerous occasions in numerous ways was Harvard violating what I take to be elementary principles of natural justice,” Galef is quoted as writing.
The authors conclude the letter by encouraging fellow scientists to consider the implications Hauser’s case could have on the field.
“As scientists, we all ought to be scared by the idea of an inquisitorial method that abolishes the scientific method by prying into unpublished work, feeds a media frenzy […] and overlooks the hypocrisy of the critics who fail to look at their own vulnerabilities and how they run their own labs… we will need all our wits about us to face this clear and present danger,” they write.
The letter was written by Pierre Pica, a scientist at the National Center for Scientific Research; Bert Vaux, director of studies in linguistics at King's College in the University of Cambridge; and Jeffrey Watumull, a Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge. Watumull previously worked in Hauser's lab.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard announced its 50th LEED certification last week, giving the University the highest number of certified green buildings of any college in the world.
The push to have buildings meet standards set forth by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design program is part of Harvard's broader sustainability efforts.
“As a University, we have a special responsibility to confront the challenges of climate change, not only through academic research but by transforming the way we operate our campus,” University President Drew G. Faust said in a statement.
In the past few weeks, three more LEED certifications have come through, bringing Harvard’s LEED-certified building projects to 53, encompassing 1.5 million square feet of space across campus. In addition, the University has 39 other projects pending certification.
In 2008, Faust committed Harvard to a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2016.
Now consistently ranked as one of the most environmentally aware schools in the country, Harvard is on track to meet its ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goal, said Colin B. Durrant, manager of sustainability communications.
“The key are green building projects that make buildings more efficient, reduce energy, and create healthier places to live, work, and learn,” Durrant said. “The other key is making the energy supply more efficient. Harvard’s utility services have worked on this. The third piece of the pie is the work that students, faculty, and staff do with individual activities.”
LEED-certified builidings span Harvard's campus, from the chapel at Harvard Business School to the Mather-Dunster kitchen.
