After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina—In Palermo Soho, one of Buenos Aires’ newer neighborhoods, the buildings aren’t renovated when they come of age. Instead they’re abandoned and left to simmer and crack under the weather and the small plants that grow on their faces.
Everywhere, walls are jutting out their limbs—metal pipes, nails, and wooden frames—almost as if in dialogue. Dust and rubble cover the surface of every cracked wall, and the buildings seemed to merge into one another as I passed them.
And then I realized that I had just walked past a giant moose. I looked to my right, and sure enough, there was a mural of an enormous blue moose with thick horns carrying a rider whose face was replaced with an open palm.
Jaz, the artist who painted it, wanted to give his neighbors something more beautiful to look at than the side of a fallen building. So one day about a year ago, he called up a friend, and the two put up ladders and spent a day constructing their moose for the people.
Since then, it has spent its days feeding off the young plants that have sprouted on top of the abandoned apartment below. Because of the way it was painted—with faded colors and a style almost as loose as the buildings themselves—I had almost missed it completely.

ROLDUC, Netherlands—The bedside clock told it me it wasn’t even six in the morning, but it was no use. Jet lag seemed a stronger force than the alarm that had consistently failed to wake me up in time for my 9:00 a.m. lectures. So I got up, got dressed, and decided to walk to Germany. With help from the twilight filtering through my window I studied Rolduc on Google Maps, grabbed a sweater, and headed out the door.
Rolduc is the location of a monastery in the southernmost part of the Netherlands where I spent the first week of my summer course. Besides medieval architecture, spacious rooms, and a deer park, Rolduc’s attractions include its location on the Dutch-German border.
A walking trail led around the outer wall of the monastery, and I set off at a brisk pace. Besides a light rain, barely perceptible under the thick forest canopy, everything was eerily still in the early morning. The path led through a tunnel formed by trees; ducklings swam in ponds on either side. Rolduc loomed like a giant castle behind me, and I felt as though I had stepped into a Disney movie.
Ten minutes later, I began to think I had set down the wrong path. Germany was nowhere in sight. Or, for all I knew, I had already crossed the border—there wouldn’t be a big Willkommen! sign in the middle of the woods. Suddenly I stumbled out of the path onto a paved lane and, turning a corner, found the marker I was looking for.
The white block letters spelling Deutschland weren’t quite as welcoming as I’d imagined, but no matter. I snapped a few pictures and planted my feet firmly on German soil. Then, noticing the rain was really starting to pick up, I scrambled back to the land of legalized hash.

MEXICO CITY—Cooking is not something I take lightly. Earlier this year, I began trying new recipes every time I returned home from school, indulging in my cooking high whenever I had the opportunity. But considering I had just graduated from boiling pasta, I was surprised to find my culinary escapades reaching new heights in Mexico.
Maria Elena is an elderly lady who rents me a bedroom in her apartment and sleeps with the TV on. When I told her that I wanted to make tamales, she scoffed. Apparently that’s not something you do at home. When I came back one day with a bag of raw black beans, she just blinked at me silently. I soon found out that they take hours of simmering and stirring to cook. When I said I wanted to make mole sauce, she told me to just go to the market and pick up a quarter kilo of it. So finally, fed up, disgruntled, and itching to cook, I decided that I was going to make flan, and that I wasn’t going to tell her.
I Googled “flan.”
A few clicks later,
 Flan al Caramelo
 azúcar, 11 cucharada
 agua, 1 cucharada
 leche, 3/4 litro
 canela en rama, 1 ramita
 yema de huevo, 7 unidades
Cool.
I proceeded to the kitchen, pulled out the ingredients and got a giant bowl. I turned on the stove and was about to caramelize the sugar when I remembered that I needed to preheat the oven. I looked around the pint-size kitchen. I opened all the cupboards, even the one above the fridge: No oven. Then I noticed a small cubbyhole in the corner. It housed something that looked like an Easy-Bake oven from the Stone Age. I opened it. A rusted pan fell out: Oven! Did it work? I pushed a button. Nope.
I sighed. There went my hopes of making the most traditional flan ever (it had to be baked, not just refrigerated—otherwise it was cheating). I was left standing alone in a birdhouse-sized kitchen with a broken, light-bulb-powered oven really craving flan. So I walked to my room, grabbed my wallet and headed outside. Thirty minutes later I was back in the kitchen with a packet of Jell-O™ Flan. It even came with a ready-made pouch of caramel sauce. Just add milk, the box said. So I added milk, filled the mixture into little bowls and put them in the fridge.
I came back to the kitchen a few hours later to eat a cup of faux flan. Maria Elena smiled at me in approval. You made flan, she said.
Yes, but not exactly.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia—Even in the brilliant light of the city’s famed white nights it was difficult to forget the first piece of advice I received when I arrived in Russia: don’t look the police in the eye.
As I traveled around the city my grandmother grew up in, I remembered the stories I had heard during the past few weeks—stories about police stopping new cars on the road and slipping cocaine into the trunks, claiming it belonged to the owners. I had heard, too, of doctors committed to psychiatric institutions after telling visiting officials that their hospitals were inaccurately portrayed, and of journalists meeting thugs on secluded roads after protesting the government-sanctioned destruction of a nature reserve. I listened to recounts of elderly women rushed to hospitals with stroke symptoms, only to enter into comas while they waited for nearly 24 hours without care. I was told that even when opposition candidates had cast votes for themselves, the final tally indicated that not a single vote was cast for any party other than United Russia—or, in other parts of the country, that United Russia received more than 100 percent of the vote. Some citizens longed for Soviet times, they said, because at least then there was law and order.
I wanted so badly to love the city of my grandmother’s youth. And I did, to an extent—the rivers, canals, world-class museums and beautiful churches—but I could never shake the feeling of insecurity that I’d gotten on day one. Despite Russia’s diplomatic show of being an increasingly open and democratic nation, there’s still a ways to go before the people have trust in their government.

SEATTLE, Wash.—I haven’t missed a World Series game since 2003. During the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, I calculated that I watched an average of 16 hours of coverage every day for two weeks.
I’ve been told on a number of occasions that I follow sports with a religious fervor.
If that’s the case, I’m caught in a theological rundown.
I grew up in Los Angeles, but I’ve been a lifelong fan of the St. Louis Cardinals. For a good chunk of my life, I would have been more likely to know tomorrow’s game time than the first names of some of my teachers.
But this summer, I work for the Seattle Mariners. And in the few weeks that I’ve worked for the club, I’ve had to make some adjustments to my long-standing allegiances.
First came the easy changes—minimal re-education, for instance, to alter the wording from “root, root, root for the Cardinals” to “root, root, root for the Mariners.” Some of the other transitions have been more difficult.
Developing an emotional connection to a sports team is, at a basic level, entirely irrational. Why waste any energy on a game whose outcome is totally out of your control? But I’ve done it for 20 years, and I have no intention of changing my behavior anytime soon.
Because of this devotion, I have to somehow convince myself to develop this kind of emotional connection to the team. The easiest way to do this, of course, is to spend time around other fans.
I’m getting there. Who knows what kind of M’s fan I’ll be by the end of the summer?
Fortunately, the Cardinals and the Mariners are in different leagues, and the two only meet once every few years at best. So I think I can manage and maintain both allegiances.
Jeremy Piven and Goldie Hawn are both Jewish Buddhists. And if they can be Jubus, why can’t I be a Cardinals-Mariners fan?
I’m sure my grandmother would be thrilled.

CIENFUEGOS, Cuba—It was a trip of firsts. The Harvard-Radcliffe Orchestra was, as far as we knew, the first American college orchestra to travel to Cuba since 1959. While the restrictions on travel to Cuba had relaxed, I felt an obligation to paint a picture of this forbidden place for my friends and family back home. They didn’t know what it was like. Then again, neither did I.
Our first concert took place in the coastal city of Cienfuegos. Two Cuban percussionists—I’ll call them Carlota and Roberto—were joining our shorthanded percussion staff, of which I was half, for George Gershwin’s Cuban Overture. After the dress rehearsal, I asked them in high school-level Spanish if they wanted to eat dinner. They did, and so did their music director, Tomasina, and the arts administrator coordinating the concerts, José.
We went into a hole-in-the-wall restaurant near the Teatro Tomás Terry, our concert hall. José ordered for us and, for my sake, guided the conversation in slow, articulate Spanish. (“Estoy oxidada,” I said to him. I'm rusty.) We compared our respective countries—the educational systems, the musical opportunities, the economies. While we drank sodas and munched on potato chips, they told me about the music they played in their orchestra and about the low salaries Cubans earn.
A two-piece band came in, and José pretended that it was my birthday so they would sing to me. Carlota and Roberto played a salsa groove on claves the band had given them. It was the first time I had heard that rhythm in Cuba, but it wouldn’t be the last. I tipped the band with my pocket change. Finally, our food came out: ham sandwiches, underwhelming. A classic American sandwich I could have gotten anywhere at home, made memorable because it was my first meal with Cubans.
When the check came, Carlota started to say something to me, which I didn’t fully hear, or maybe just didn’t understand. All I heard was—"para nosotros." For us. I thought she and the others were offering to pay for me. I quickly told her that of course they didn't have to do that.
Something was lost in translation. I took out my money, but nobody else did. They just sort of sat there, expectantly, while I put down a few bills. Maybe they were going to pay me back? I didn’t bother asking. And I appreciated their company and trusted them enough not to feel ripped off, either. I don’t know whether they thought I had offered to pay for them; I don’t know whether they couldn’t pay, since the bill was in Cuban convertible pesos (CUC), the tourists’ currency, and not in the regular pesos Cubans are paid in. Maybe they simply couldn’t afford it—what in my country would be an inexpensive dinner for five ($22) cost more than the average monthly salary there. Perhaps it was just some cultural more I hadn’t learned about yet.
Whatever the reason, it was certainly a first for me.

NICE, France—When living in another country, even the simplest tasks become missions. Soon after my arrival in Nice I was tasked with such a mission, and I had no choice but to accept it: I needed to find a bathroom.
I had just finished my third day at my internship in Nice, and I wanted nothing more than to escape the scorching sun and wander down to the Mediterranean Sea. But my grumbling stomach and full bladder soon clouded my thoughts and two more mundane duties—food and toilet—took priority.
 
In the stifling heat, the only breeze in the entire city seemed to be finding a good baguette at one of the many boulangeries lining the streets. But, task one complete, that’s when I learned the hard way that public restrooms are difficult to find in the south of France.
I ran to hotels, bakeries, supermarkets, cafés, and shops; all denied me entrance to the much-needed throne. Frustrated, I ended up turning back to catch the bus—hoping to get home before the fuse blew—but before departing I decided to give my luck one last shot. I gripped my tummy tight, entered a quirky café called The Scottish Tea Shop and with my best French asked: "Est-ce qu'il y a des toilettes?"
To my relief, the waiter smiled and with a little laugh replied, "En face, mademoiselle," pointing outside. I turned my head—just a few steps across the street was a little brown sign advertising the restrooms. With a slight smile and little nod to the kind gentleman I rushed over, proud of my accomplishment.

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia—Russia has the highest recorded abortion rate in the world, a reality that I became acutely aware of when a Russian acquaintance in her twenties told me offhandedly that most of her female friends had had an abortion. That Russian women so frequently exercise their right to choose seems a feminist victory. Yet the victory is a superficial one when access to contraception may well have prevented the pregnancies in the first place. Widespread access to abortion can indeed only be called a victory for women under the condition that it is made rare by widespread access to family planning and birth control.
Unfortunately, abortion is birth control for many Russian women. Few women use preventative birth control, which is often expensive and remains socially deviant. A Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty feature from 2008 reported that sex education is not part of the national curriculum in Russia, an absurd reality that leaves men and women ignorant of their birth control options and, when confronted by an unplanned pregnancy, with little choice but to opt for a hazardous and emotionally taxing abortion. And that confrontation is extremely widespread—figures from 2006 report 1.6 million abortions compared to 1.5 million live births.
Meanwhile, Russia’s small but burgeoning anti-abortion movement, beginning to resemble its counterpart in the United States, is aiming to limit women’s access to abortion and the morning-after pill. According to The New York Times, their proposed legislation would require a woman over six weeks pregnant to see her embryo or fetus on ultrasound, hear its heartbeat, and have counseling.
While few would contest that Russian women receive abortions at alarmingly high rates, impeding a woman’s right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is a senseless solution. How can we effectively reduce the incidence of abortion in a nation whose women, for better or for worse, wish to limit their number of pregnancies? To begin with, affordable and widely accessible birth control; the potential of simple and effective prevention cannot be overstated.

This Friday afternoon at 12:30 p.m., the St. George's School for Girls performed in Winthrop Square Park outside Peet's Coffee & Tea. Their performance included a choir, saxophones, brass, and jazz musicians. The all-girls boarding school from Edinburgh, Scotland is touring Massachusetts; their first stop was in Cambridge.
Missed their performance? Never fear — there's more free music to be found. Music That Matters summer camp will be performing in the "pit" at the Harvard Square T-Stop on July 2nd and 8th from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. All donations collected at their two performances will go to the charities "Music For Relief," which helps victims of the Japanese tsunami, and "To Write Love on Her Arms," a nonprofit assisting victims of depression, addiction, and self-harm. Music That Matters is sponsored by the Plugged In Teen Band Program, a Needham, MA organization that, according to their website, "give[s] young people a venue through which they can channel their creativity, learn to work in a group, and improve their music skills while learning about the value and importance of social activism."
