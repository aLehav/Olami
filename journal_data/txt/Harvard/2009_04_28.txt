After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Though a January without College programming certainly dealt a blow to our vision of calendar reform, we hope that, going forward, the College makes strides to increase the opportunities available to students. The financial recession may have made January coursework too expensive for the College, but a number of less costly initiatives can help students pursue meaningful extracurricular, athletic, academic, or career-related activities during these few weeks.
On a most basic level, the new committee established by Dean Evelynn M. Hammonds to determine housing eligibility should use the broadest possible guidelines to maximize the number of students who can remain on campus. For students who wish to work for the Institute of Politics, rehearse with their dance troupe, or work at a Boston-based company, housing is a fundamental need. Asking these students to find temporary housing elsewhere because their activities are not explicitly tied to the College would be unreasonable—not only because it disproportionately affects students with fewer financial resources, but also because it runs counter to the original aim of the “January Experience.” 
Unfortunately, in Dean Hammonds’s most recent letter to students, she writes that the “threshold for approval to return to campus in January 2010 will be high” due to the reduced housing staff and limited dining space. We certainly understand that financial and logistical constraints will play a role in how these rules are crafted, but we hope that the College will explore other cost-saving measures in the interests of maximizing students’ opportunities. For example, if food costs are a constraint, perhaps the College can offer a housing-only option with no meal plan to those students engaged in off-campus activities. Ultimately, January was intended to provide students a time and space to pursue non-academic or non-traditional interests. If the College is too financially strapped to actually provide coursework for such pursuits, the least it can do is to provide a space for student groups and other institutions to create such programming.
Moreover, the College can also help to expand student options by advising undergrads on various January opportunities, both within the U.S. and abroad. A well-structured advising program—replete with information about international experiences, internships, coursework, research, and travel funding—would be a very effective way to facilitate valuable experiences for students. For such a program to be effective, however, the College must work quickly to find and publicize these opportunities to students, who are no doubt anxious about where they will be in January 2010.
Beyond January 2010, however, the College should re-evaluate the January period. Dean Hammonds has promised to use this coming year’s experience “to inform our decisions about how best to view this period in future years.” We hope this promise holds true. In future years, when financial constraints are no longer so prohibitive, the administration should fulfill its original goal—of providing a period of structured programming in which students have the option and opportunity to pursue interesting and unconventional interests on campus.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the past five years, Pakistan’s Northwest Frontier Province  and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas have been the site of a grueling, bloody, and brutal guerrilla war between the U.S.-backed Pakistani government and the Taliban. Three broken cease-fires and thousands of deaths later, the two sides are no closer to resolving their quarrel over control of the disputed territory. In the past year alone, Taliban fighters have attacked NATO supply convoys, the Sri Lankan cricket team on its visit to Lahore, and Pakistani outposts in the region. 
While the conflict has always been something of a low-intensity guerrilla war, recent news reports from the region confirm that Taliban militants have begun to advance into a key region just 60 miles from Pakistan’s capital, Islamabad. A temporary peace agreement has stopped the worst of the fighting, but the insurgency is clearly an existential threat to the Pakistani government, which has been relatively cooperative with the U.S. to root out terrorists in the region. As such, given the critical security situation in Pakistan and the region as a whole—Islamabad also controls the only nuclear arsenal in the Muslim world—it is high time that the United States reconsider the nature of its alliance with the Islamic Republic. 
After the September 11 attacks, the United States sought to forge a closer link to its former Cold War ally, pledging billions of dollars in military aid and equipment to Islamabad. But Pakistan’s anti-Taliban stance did not signal a genuine commitment to change its repressive domestic regime. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, whom President George W. Bush praised as one of America’s strongest allies in the war on terror, was the fourth military dictator to seize power in that troubled nation’s six decades of existence. Last year, Musharraf was forced to resign by a democratically elected coalition government, but conditions on the ground have barely improved; Amnesty International USA continues to document hundreds of “disappearances” in Baluchistan.
While cutting off aid to Pakistan entirely would be a poor decision given the critical situation on the ground, it is important for the United States to reconsider its current policy of unconditional aid to the Pakistani government. In the 1980s, the George H.W. Bush administration wisely imposed arms-export controls on Islamabad, ending the export of nuclear-capable F-16 fighter jets when confronted with evidence of Pakistan’s underground nuclear program. These restraints were tightened on President Clinton’s watch when Pakistan exploded its first nuclear bomb in May 1998. But, after the Musharraf government’s post-9/11 about-face, the American government resumed deliveries of the fighter jet. While we support a strong Pakistan that can fight terrorism, we wonder why a country that is unable to secure its own borders needs a multi-million-dollar fighter aircraft. 
Current American policy suits neither our national interest nor our democratic values. Continued unrestricted high-value exports of sensitive military materiel will not help Pakistan to fight the Taliban insurgency on its northwest frontier. Similarly, our policy of no-strings-attached support for Pakistan’s government—which has resulted in a shameful lack of progress on the important issues of human rights and democracy—should instead be restructured in such a way that prioritizes concrete improvements in that government’s human-rights record while maintaining a strategic relationship of mutual benefit. 
Of course, the conflict in Pakistan is intimately linked to our own battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan. As the Bush administration’s misguided and horrendously expensive war in Iraq winds down, we are happy to see that President Obama is redirecting our military and reconstruction efforts to bring peace and stability to that war-torn country and hope that, if the situation stabilizes in that country, the same will happen in Pakistan’s frontier areas. 
Regardless of developments in Afghanistan, the Obama administration should seriously reevaluate our current security posture in South Asia and devise a comprehensive diplomatic agenda for the region that calls for the stabilization of Afghanistan and Pakistan, the eradication of the Taliban and the drug trade, and a positive role for India, a fellow democracy that has proven to be a reliable partner since the bilateral nuclear treaty of 2006. Only a comprehensive South Asian agenda that takes all of these complex variables into account has any chance of permanently resolving the core issues at stake.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In lecture a few weeks ago, I observed a guy sitting in the row in front of me watching three-fourths of the movie “Twilight.” Two seats down from him, two people were going through Google images of Beyoncé. I turned to note this to my neighbor, who nodded while scrolling through her BlackBerry.
These people weren’t anomalies. Though the lecture, delivered by a professor ranked 4.3 in the CUE Guide, was a fairly interesting one, a good portion of the class looked up from their various screens only when a phrase was prefaced with the warning, “This might be on the midterm.” It looked like in this class, at least in this lecture, intellectualism was dead. But I don’t blame the people—I blame the technology.
The introduction of laptops and wireless Internet into the classroom environment has allowed us to prioritize our time in a highly pragmatic way. No longer are the choices in class between doodling in a notebook and paying attention; now we have an entire workstation at our fingertips. We can e-mail, organize, and update away while a professor is explaining easy or boring material that presumably doesn’t warrant full attention.
The problem is that while many initiate these side tasks with the intention of only drifting away from class for a short period of time, we often don’t have that self-control. More and more of our attention is taken up by reading blogs or clicking through Wikipedia, until we’ve de-prioritized listening to everything but the most essential concepts.
This approach may allow for the best economization of time—it’s probably possible to fill in gaps in the syllabus during reading period, and those emails need to be sent for tomorrow. However, taking on this cost-benefit view of class time both diminishes enjoyment of the course and contributes to a cycle of indifference under which class quality suffers.  
When a successful class is defined by acquiring the minimum amount of necessary information in the minimum amount of time, then something is off. Lectures should be interesting, not just useful for the midterm, and when we budget our class time we give up on this basic intellectual ideal. The nuances that get cut with an economic approach to class time are what make the Harvard academic experience more than four years of test prep. When we drop them, we drop learning for its own sake, that clichéed goal that we laud but clearly do not internalize as we fail the simple laptop-lecture attention test.
Furthermore, class quality on the whole suffers from individual indifference. After all, if we don’t pay attention to anything but vital concepts, why should professors attempt to engage us anymore? Why should they add details or throw in a joke when we’re not looking to be interested? Surely, the prospect of lecturing to 200 metallic screens is a discomfiting one, and even more so when they know that an awkward non-response to a question in lecture means that 200 people are logged onto gchat.
The best antidote to the rise of viral activity during class time would be to pull the plug on wireless internet in classes in which it is not academically necessary. This would inevitably upset many students. However, such a reaction would only prove the degree to which zoning out in class thanks to technology is ingrained in the way we spend our class time. Such paternalism may not be the answer, but certainly something has to change. After all, the lecture hall is beginning to resemble Lamont Café, without the lattes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The history of amphetamines shows that the use of Adderall to study or to get high at college campuses has exploded.  While drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, and Concerta are prescribed primarily to treat ADHD/ADD, multiple surveys reveal rampant use—as great as 35 percent of students on some campuses—of students who admit to the illegal use of a prescription stimulant.
Everyone on campus knows about illegal Adderall or Concerta usage and knows where these drugs can be obtained quickly—in order to study, to cram, to pull an all-nighter, or to get high.  Technically, while selling and distributing prescription stimulants is a federal crime, the Drug Enforcement Agency rarely takes action against students.
There is much urban legend at college and high-school scenes about the effects and side effects of Adderall. Having prescribed stimulants like Adderall to patients for over 30 years, I offer the following as a misuser’s guide to Adderall.
Adderall does improve performance in normal, learning-disabled, and ADHD/ADD students, as measured by short-term improvements in tests and grades.  The improvement comes as a result of more efficient test-taking and studying, in the form of more focus, deliberation, efficient methodology, and decreased fatigue.
However, Adderall does not improve complex thinking tasks. For example, Adderall will not improve reading comprehension but will allow the user to go over the paragraph multiple times to obtain the answer. Without the drug, fatigue, boredom, or distractibility might occur. It is also not clear whether Adderall “works” by actually improving performance or by simply improving motivation. It decreases procrastination but will not turn the “no” of a defiant child into a “yes” for getting homework done.
Adderall’s most consistent effect is to give users the sense that they are doing better in their tasks.  This positive sense, which can become grandiose and manic, may be the strongest contribution to the real improved performance.  Under the influence of the drug, people feel better about their performance. Therefore, they perform at least a little better in reality, yet not as well as they think.
Despite the short-term academic gains, there is no evidence that Adderall improves learning overall or that short-term gains in learning persist without the continued use of the drug.  What a user produces on an exam will not necessarily translate to long-term knowledge or improved performance without the continued use of the drug.
Common side effects of Adderall are loss of appetite and trouble falling asleep—for some, desired effects. While highly publicized, psychotic reactions to occasional oral doses of Adderall are rare.  Serious misjudgment can occur, such as writing an hour’s worth of essay in microscopic print.  More gravely, snorting crushed Adderall increases the very small risk of a cardiac arrhythmia that can be fatal.
Government data from surveys conducted in 2002 suggest that about one in 10 casual college-age users of illegally obtained Adderall reports his use as consistent with clinical levels of abuse and addiction. If you’re using Adderall illegally, the risk of becoming addicted to it or another stimulant drug (like cocaine or methamphetamine) is about 10 percent.
So, if you use Adderall illegally or legally, it’s worth asking why you are in college and whether the path you’ve chosen best fits your personality and talents. It may be that many of you are in school because the other option is to live at home with your parents, playing video games and working at a restaurant.  Or the academic work may be too hard.  Your skills and interests lie elsewhere or are still to be determined.  If you regularly require Adderall to cope or do well, you are likely still trying to squeeze yourself into that old, rigid educational hole your parents tried to shove you into before you were “on your own.”
If you’re doing Adderall on a regular basis to cope, you may soon also need another drug.  Perhaps it will be Xanax—to deal with the anxiety of having gotten to a place where you really don’t belong based upon your own chemical makeup.  If you don’t want to go to an MD for anti-anxiety medication, just smoke more weed. If you’re using Adderall to get high, you are running the same risks of getting truly caught up with one of the worst drug addictions possible (they weren’t kidding in the 1960s when “Speed Kills” first appeared as wall graffiti in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco).
If you’re a regular misuser of Adderall, maybe this is a good time to reexamine your immediate goals and career path.  These are tough economic times for everyone, with or without a college degree.  Take a close look at your talents and what actually interests you. While you only run a one in 10 chance of becoming addicted to Adderall, the chances are much higher that, if you don’t figure out what you want and what you can do well, you will not only need Adderall, but also a few other psychiatric drugs, for the rest of your life.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I could hear the howls from three blocks away. But I still gasped as I walked into the sprawling Dong Xuan live-animal market in Hanoi, Vietnam. Dogs, many with open wounds, cowed in the corners of tiny wire cages stacked five high, as restaurateurs and butchers haggled over slaughter prices. Monkeys, chickens, and lizards huddled in cages scarcely larger than their bodies. In one cage, two young rabbits silently shook in fear as a python was placed in alongside them.
For the last three semesters I’ve written a Crimson column on animal protection, and for many years I’ve been a strict vegetarian. During that time, many friends and readers have voiced their surprise that I care so much about such an unlikely cause. Many, I think, have simply assumed I’ve always been this way—as if I were born with a PETA membership card and an inexplicably visceral distaste for KFC. 
Yet, for the first 15 years of my life, the opposite was true: I ate meat, attended rodeos, and even occasionally went hunting in our family’s forest. A longtime vegetarian friend recently remembered that I teased her in middle school for her “rabbit diet” of fruit and vegetables. So what changed? In this, my last Crimson column, I would like to tell the story of how I became an animal advocate and explain why I believe history will judge our generation harshly based on our treatment of animals.
Looking back, I would love to pretend that my life changed after my chance encounter with the Vietnamese live-animal market. But it didn’t. In my mind, vegetarianism remained the preserve of health-obsessed teenage girls and animal rights the territory of self-righteous former hippies. Being neither, I returned to New Zealand and continued attending meat-filled barbeques at weekend rugby games.
But, if I was determined to never become a PETA acolyte, I also couldn’t shake entirely what I had seen in Vietnam. I read Matthew Scully’s beautiful book Dominion: The Power of Man, the Suffering of Animals, and the Call to Mercy and began to wonder if our meat-production system merely sanitized and institutionalized the cruelty I had seen in Vietnam. Increasingly unsettled, I made a fateful decision to visit a slaughterhouse.
From its exterior, the slaughterhouse I visited looked very unlike the chaotic street market in Vietnam—its whitewashed walls satisfy our desire to ignore how meat is made. But inside the process was just as menacing: Huge chutes drove a pig every three seconds toward her death.
As I stood on the kill floor, I watched the moment when each pig, emerging from the chute, sensed its fate; the sudden piercing squeal followed by the too-late attempt to turn and run—some pigs literally attempting to scramble up vertical walls—as metal shackles were clamped around their ankles. And I watched as the shackles hoisted each pig into the air and as the slaughterer’s knife sent blood splattering across my overalls.
Then I watched as the mechanical disassembly line swung into action. First, the scalding tank that loosened the pig’s skin, then the series of machines and knife-wielding workers who swiftly converted the pig into a plastic-wrapped meat parcel. I asked one worker, “Do pigs ever get skinned alive?” “No,” he quickly replied, and then modified, “Well, when they do, I get really annoyed about it; that creates more work.” 
American slaughterhouses kill 10 billion chickens, pigs, and cows every year in such conditions. Yet more troubling are the lives these animals lead before their deaths. Most farm animals today never feel sunlight, fresh air, or grass beneath their feet. Confined in narrow veal crates, gestation crates, and battery cages, millions of calves, pigs, and hens cannot even turn around or extend their limbs. And they live like this—sentient creatures capable of feeling pain and pleasure—for their entire wretched lives.
This year I wrote my senior thesis on those cages. What struck me most forcefully was how the horrific has become normal. Last week, a pig factory farm in Shuyer County, Illinois, burnt down. The owners had economized by neither installing a sprinkler system nor a night watchman who could release the pigs. In the ensuing blaze, 11,000 pigs were burnt alive, many struggling frantically to escape their cages—firefighters recalled the horrific squeals they heard. Yet nothing changed. The owners promptly claimed insurance and will soon rebuild their factory farm.
Such stories, and the broader reality they encapsulate, first persuaded me to buy only free-range meat, and later to become a strict vegetarian. I’ve never fully accepted any abstract theory of animal rights, nor do I think one needs to in order to sense that something has gone horribly wrong. For me, the horrors of the slaughterhouse and the suffering of the factory farm attest to that. 
We are all complicit in a great moral crisis. But there is also hope: By informing ourselves, supporting political change, and even going vegetarian, we can end factory farming. I hope that I have persuaded you over the past year and a half that we must.

Some technological breakthroughs affect our lives more than others. The Tamagotchi, while endlessly entertaining, did not rock my world. Toilet sensors, on the other hand, did. Electric fireplaces? Absolutely. The Nike/iPod music-playing, run-pacing shoe device? Not so much. But above and beyond these modern advancements, the video chat holds a special place in my heart.  I’m not talking about the drawn-out process of arranging a precise time to meet at the computer to catch up on weeks of activity. I’m talking about the casual hello. The quickie. The in-and-out, sometimes lasting just seconds. Soon everyone will have a laptop with a built-in camera, meaning my Gchat bar will be full of video icons and no more of those outdated dots. And who doesn’t like to check themselves out? Let’s be real. You have the big box with your brother/lover/Thai pen pal/parole officer, but then you have that smaller box in the upper corner with your own face—the best of both worlds. Depending on how stimulating the conversation is (a steamy striptease versus pretending to care about someone else’s problems), you can always just admire your digital image staring back at you. And even if said person catches you catching a vainglorious glimpse, chances are he/she was doing the same thing moments earlier. Technology has brought us full circle: from actually talking in person, to writing letters, to talking on the phone, to writing e-mails, to, once again, speaking face-to-face, whether from opposite ends of the globe or from opposite ends of the classroom. Vid chat is the closest thing to the real thing. No more of this abbreviating bullshit: “heyyyy.” “sup?” “nm, u?” “brb.” “k.” Those days are, thankfully, coming to an end. Give your fingers a rest. Cut the middleman.  Unless you’re ugly, in which case typing is just fine.

Oh, great, I didn’t see you there, but then I did. Your face disappeared for a few seconds because the connection was slow. We both look ridiculous looking down into a camera, our faces are a little grainy, and we have fish-eyes. But let’s chat.Now, I love talking at a two inch, two dimensional representation of a human face just as much as the next person, but can someone please tell me the purpose of the window in the corner where I can see myself? I don’t set up a mirror to watch myself during normal conversations, so why should I during a video chat?I don’t like it when intruders pop into the image on the other end, just to say “Hi!” or wave and remark how cool video chatting is because they can see themselves wave in the self-reflection. First of all, why is that so cool? And b) of all, get out of my conversation.Even worse: someone could be watching the video chat from beyond the frame, unbeknownst to you. You’re too busy looking at the image of yourself in the corner, discovering how you can expand the little box that it’s in.One of my friends used to add backgrounds to her iChats. There would be fish floating behind her head, or safari animals walking around in the background. Midway through the conversation, there would be a hot air balloon taking off behind her head. What the hell am I supposed to say to that? Cool? I’m not five years old and don’t actually believe you are in the middle of the Serengeti (because they don’t have Wi-Fi)?But I don’t want to be an asshole, so I just say, “How’d you do that?”

Not quite ready to choose your own junior tutorial leader or thesis advisor for next year? FM has some sound advice to guide you through the daunting process.First comes your own window shopping. Ensure that your advisor is someone with whom you can tolerate spending some serious quality time.  A practical consideration: while being easy on the eyes doesn’t hurt, excessive good looks may be detrimental if you are as easily distracted as FM is.Once you have nailed your target, here is how to snag him or her as your very own:1. Not all department members are required to accept the responsibility for an overambitious and overextended Harvard undergrad. Hey section guy, it’s time to suck up your overconfidence and pride and remember that the professors may actually know more than you do. On the other hand, if you do have some semblance of a social life, here are things to avoid: drunk dialing potential candidates, letting your friends drunk dial them, or arriving red-eyed to a meeting with them after many drunk dials.2. Outshine the competition. Be aware of their current research, remember the names and ages of their children, and always, always agree with their opinions. Stalking is a form of flattery. Another good method: allow your target to become inebriated at a concentration party (hey, it’s been known to happen)—while, of course, declining to partake yourself—and then make your move. Odds are they will be in a better mood and agree to be your personal babysitter for the next year.3. Should you fail at achieving your goal (or simply be too lazy to find your own advisor), some departments will be nice enough to play matchmaker rather than screw you over. Or at least that’s what FM would like to think they are doing.

The door to office M314 in the Mallinckrodt Chemsitry lab is open. Through the doorway sits a large, smudgy whiteboard—just begging to be written on. And across from that whiteboard, behind a chic, silver-grey desk sits Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology Tobias Ritter. Though Ritter has the difficult job of teaching the second half of the notoriously grueling Chem 20-Chem 30 sequence of organic chemistry, his Q ratings glow—a breathtaking 4.7 for fall 2007-2008. “I take every single student as seriously as I do my colleagues,” Ritter says. “When I prepare to give a talk to my colleagues, I obviously prepare very well. I think it’s also very import to prepare very well for teaching.” Charles Liu ’11, a premed who took Chem 30 rather than the more biologically-inclined Chem 17-Chem 27 track, speaks highly of Ritter. “He’s definitely one of the reasons I decided to take this course,” Liu says. “The course was very challenging, definitely the hardest course I’ve taken so far at Harvard,” he adds. “But it was very rewarding because it’s well taught.” Students were particularly impressed by Ritter’s commitment to teaching. After the second midterms came in lower than he expected, Ritter began holding Saturday study group sessions. “He really didn’t want to water down the course,” Liu says. “He’d rather hold extra sessions and change how he was teaching than do that.” “Professor Ritter is very clearly enthusiastic about the material and he does a great job of conveying that,” agrees classmate Sophie Cai ’11. “Most professors don’t want to teach on Saturdays.” Ritter, though, seems equally impressed and inspired by his students. “It’s very exciting to see students progress from just simple chemical principles to advanced chemistry,” he says. “I think because I’m getting very excited about that, the students may too.” Ritter is making a difference through his research as well. He sees his biggest accomplishment as elucidating the creation of carbon fluorine bonds from transition metals. He continues his work in transition metal-mediated transformations with the hope of having “an immediate impact on human health.” He explains, “There are certain problems in medical areas that may have their solutions in chemistry. One example of that is a very powerful imaging technology, PET. Positron emission tomography.” The technology is limited at a chemical level, creating a boundary for hospitals, and Ritter’s goal is to overcome this through scientific research. Ritter may be better known, though, for his status as one of the Department’s hottest professors. One blog calls Ritter a contender for “Harvard’s Top Chemistry Hunk.” When asked about this particular title, Ritter—dressed in jeans and a pastel Tommy Hilfiger sweater—laughs and shakes his head in disbelief. “People keep telling me that, but I just never...” Ritter starts over. “So some students told me and I looked on the Internet, and I couldn’t find anything.” He laughs again. “But obviously I didn’t look very hard.” If there’s a fan base, Liu remains skeptical that it affects Ritter’s enrollment numbers. “With the difficulty of the course and the reputation of the course, the people that take it are really serious about chemistry,” he says. Liu pauses and adds, “A lot of people think he looks like Anakin Skywalker. Not Hayden Christensen, though. Anakin Skywalker.” But it’s Ritter’s teaching that leaves a lasting impression among his students, as Cai says, “I definitely learned a lot.”

Standing casually in the hallway of Maxwell Dworkin’s third floor, bespectacled and wearing a basic brown sweater, David J. Malan ’99 explains why he thinks computers are sexy. “I think that once you’ve become sufficiently acclimated to the world of computer science, you do begin to see sexiness in lines of code and an elegance that someone who hasn’t taken a class like CS50 would never notice,” says Malan. When asked what he thinks the sexiest thing about working on computers is, he laughs: “We don’t really talk in superlatives.” As the instructor for Computer Science 50, Harvard’s introductory Computer Science course, Malan is on a mission to catapult computer science to the forefront of students’ academic interests. “He has this motivation to enroll as many people as possible into the course,” says head teaching fellow and former student A. Cansu Aydede ’11. The CS50 fair, which took place this year and allowed students to showcase their final projects to the larger community, is evidence of this mission. Malan says that his motivation to broaden CS50’s appeal stems from his own experience with the class when he was an undergraduate at Harvard. Originally a government concentrator, he didn’t take CS50 until his sophomore year. “It was reputed even among the geeky circles I was already running with that it was a scary course, that it was supposed to have a lot of work,” says Malan. Since he began teaching the course two years ago, Malan has sought to dispel this stigma. He’s brought in LOLcatz, physically ripped a phonebook in half to demonstrate binary search, and even debuted a clothing line of CS50 apparel. His former Mather House Master, Sandra A. Naddaff ’75, is hardly surprised by these endeavors. “He has a very entrepreneurial spirit as well as real intellectual creativity and he’s not afraid to use it in the classroom,” says Naddaff. Professor and Associate Dean for Information Technology Henry H. Leitner attributes increasing enthusiasm for Computer Science to Malan’s dynamic approach. “Malan has almost single-handedly been responsible for significant increases in the Computer Science concentration,” says Leitner. Although he is focused on innovation, Malan’s energy remains targeted at students. “He does a good job making people feel involved with lots of interactive demonstrations, and always being accessible,” says Gregory D. Brockman ’12, one of Malan’s students. Creating podcasts and holding weekly lunches for students, Malan seeks to be a pioneer in ways that extend beyond the material he teaches. He is breaking new ground by making the course available online to people outside the Harvard community, holding virtual office hours that enable students to communicate with him or a Teaching Fellow via the course Web site.Malan, who was first appointed a lecturer at the Extension School during his senior year at the College, says that he aims to  constantly change and improve. Yet in spite of the praise he has received from students, Malan characterizes his path to teaching as sort of a fluke. “I never imagined that I would be doing what I’m doing right now. I started teaching because I wanted to get better at public speaking,” says Malan, “My junior year of college I ran for the UC, lost miserably, and realized painfully during that process that I had lost or never had a very good knack for public speaking.” Since then, he has worked to improve those skills, and hopes to keep them in use. “I will teach CS 50 for as long as they will let me,” says Malan, “It is what I love. “

Her smile never wavers and her hands are in constant motion as she explains her research on medieval China. Though the walls of her office on the second floor of the Harvard-Yenching Library are lined with all sorts of heavy volumes—in both Chinese and English—her demeanor is light and unpretentious.
The conversation moves on to the various artifacts displayed in nooks throughout her impeccably neat office. She suddenly stands and reaches into a drawer.
“Well, if you’re interested in artifacts, you probably didn’t see this yet,” she says. 
Out comes a beautiful but deadly bronze pike head, from some indeterminate Chinese dynasty. One thing is for sure: Xiaofei Tian, Professor of Chinese Literature, is full of surprises. 
Tenured at age 34 in September of 2006, one would never guess Tian’s status as an expert of her field from her youthful appearance. It wouldn’t be the first time that she’s exceeded expectations. Tian graduated from Beijing University at the tender age of 17 before receiving her doctorate in comparative literature here at Harvard in 1998. 
Tian can’t single out one specific turning point in her career. “I suppose that everything that happens in your life sort of contributes to what you become one day.” She smiles again.
Outside of her office and in the classroom, Tian is just as animated and down-to-earth. “I think she’s very inspiring. She never gets impatient with anybody and she’s always smiling,” Feifei Yi ’12 says, who took Chinese 187: “Art and Violence in the Cultural Revolution” with Tian last fall. 
“She really tries to engage the class even though it’s really difficult to do so considering the subject matter,” says Sisi Pan ’11, who is currently enrolled in Tian’s Foreign Cultures 68: “Authority and the Claims of the Individual in Chinese Literary Culture.” “She’s so incredibly supportive,” Pan adds. 
Her Foreign Cultures class crams 3,000 years of Chinese history and literature into one course—quite a daunting task. 
“I think when we talk about 3000 years of Chinese history in one course, I think you see great changes in values,” Tian says. “I want to show people that apart from the New York Times version of China, there’s another China. You have to scratch the surface and see what’s there, see what’s underneath.”
She also says that she wants to dispel the stereotype that Chinese culture can be described in full as Confucianism. “It’s much bigger and much more complicated than that,” she says, her voice betraying a rare hint of exasperation. 
As one might expect, such ideas aren’t exactly in line with China’s current government. As a participant in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Tian sidesteps any outright derision of the Communist party. When pressed for an opinion, Tian says, “Nothing lasts forever. In the grand scheme of history, it’s really a very short period of time.” 
Though Tian’s work focuses on the past, she says that because nothing stays in place forever, we need to look into not only the past but also the future. “Because things are changing, we can’t live in the past,” she says.

While Professor Jennifer L. Roberts works with artifacts hundreds of years old, she’s in no danger of gathering moss herself.  As the Gardner Cowles Associate Professor of the History of Art and Architecture, specializing in American art from the colonial age to modernism, she constantly strives to enliven her subject, locating art objects in vibrant contexts. “It’s important for students to understand that art objects are very dense objects, just as dense as a novel or scientific treatise,” says Roberts. “These are real historical documents that are filled with information.”A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford, Roberts did not even discover her interest in art history until senior year. “I started out in human biology, which I did for two years, then I switched to English, and ended up my senior year double majoring in English and Art History.” Roberts says that what really drew her to art history was the interdisciplinary aspect of the field, which allowed her to apply her knowledge of biology, history, science, geology, engineering, literature, and even philosophy. As she describes art history, “It’s an infinite field for intellectual curiosity.”Harvard students can’t seem to get enough of Roberts. Last fall, her seminar on pop art attracted three times the class’s capacity. No doubt Roberts’ methods had a great deal to do with the popularity of the course, as well as the subject matter.  “The readings can be very difficult, like readings about theories of modernism,” Roberts explains. “But every week, I give the students a single image to think about, and they are all expected to think about that image as they do that reading. We spend much of that week’s discussion talking about that image­— I think it gives people something really concrete on which to focus their reading.”“She brings a unique perspective and a high level of scholarship that, when combined with her approachable nature, makes her an outstanding professor,” says Vanessa R. Dube ’10, a future senior thesis advisee of Roberts’ and a Crimson editorial editor. The professor’s popularity extends beyond the HAA department. In 2005, Professor Roberts was selected by the then-junior class of the College to give one of only four lectures to parents during Junior Parents Weekend.The academic world has also recognized Roberts’ talent. She has received numerous prestigious fellowships, won four awards for excellence in teaching undergraduates, and has published two books, with a third to be released next year.  Katie A. Pfohl, a teaching fellow for Roberts’ HAA 17y : “American Encounters: Art, Contact, & Conflict 1560-1860” praises her, saying that “she teaches students to construct an interface between objects of history and culture in an incredibly evocative and dynamic way.” Robin E. Kelsey, the Loeb Professor of Humanities, has only glowing things to say about Roberts, as well. “She is a model colleague, who brings diligence and creativity to every departmental endeavor.”Roberts normally inaugurates every HAA 1 course, an introduction to general art history that features a different professor each week, with a lecture on the Spiral Jetty by Robert Smithson. The Spiral Jetty is a 1,500 foot-long earthwork made of rocks, mud and salt that juts into the Great Salt Lake. The land art is left totally unprotected against nature—it dips below water level, changes color and erodes.  Roberts says that she chooses this piece every year to “break down people’s assumptions about art history right away. It’s not just a painting on the wall— you can’t possibly separate it from its environment.”  The Spiral Jetty illustrates Roberts’ central message of art interacting with life, and her point seems to be getting across to students. “From her classes, I have learned to investigate art and everyday objects which seem benign,” says Dube, “and to unpack and question the loaded meanings that these objects can have for their users, and for society at large.”

CORRECTION APPENDEDIt’s 1 p.m. sharp on a cloudy Thursday afternoon, and room 114 of the Barker Center sits completely empty. This may be the room to which Assistant Professor of African and African American Studies Duana Fullwiley is assigned to teach African and African American Studies 199: “Delimiting Health Disparities in the African Diaspora,” but instead of staying cooped up in the classroom, she and her 18 hand-picked students are out in Boston, working with various immigrant African communities and putting to work all they have learned the first half of the semester.  One of these students is African and African American Studies concentrator Tonia N. Branche ’10, who describes how much she enjoyed the class, last semester’s new addition to the department’s curriculum. “The new thing the African and African American Studies department is trying out is ‘social engagement’ and we’re learning to do medical anthropology research. The work we do makes an impact on the communities,” she says. “We really get to know people, get to work with them, have conversations with them. I’ve really learned a lot about ethnographic research and its importance.” As a professor here at Harvard, Fullwiley has been active in creating a curriculum that’s broad and interdisciplinary, founding and chairing “The Committee of Social Engagement” in her department. The committee emphasizes an intellectual collaboration with communities, especially African and migrant communities, concerning various health issues. “We want to give back something, and students are actually doing research and political work and coming up with ways to address the needs that different communities need,” Fullwiley says. [SEE CORRECTION BELOW]Although Fullwiley will be on leave doing research for the 2009-2010 school year, she intends to greatly expand social engagement in the Department upon her return. “When we come back I have plans to do the health disparities course again, and second semester to do a course specifically on deliverables, and come up with projects and yield products that are deliverable directly to the communities we work with,” Fullwiley says.  Students rushing to sign up for her next class should be warned, though. Fullwiley is picky when it comes to her students. “The classes I teach aren’t very big and are usually limited to 18 students. There’s an application process because I need kids committed to global health and I need to be able to screen students on where they’ve been in the world, language skills they’ve had, what they’ve been through. Our students are trained in these African languages and I needed students open to that, among other things.”  Though Fullwiley does not know what the next years will bring, she hopes to stay at Harvard for the foreseeable future. “In five or ten years it’s really hard to say. I hope I’m still a professor here. We live in a very different era now where people move around so much because of their careers.” Branche, however, is quick to note Fullwiley’s staying power. “She’s very well versed in the material that she presents us, definitely always on top of her game and always challenging us and encouraging us to look at things from a different perspective and understand different views of a culture. I can definitely see her being tenured in the not too distant future.”  Another one of her students, Chemistry concentrator Xun Zhou ’10, who decided to take the junior tutorial in African and African American Studies after being inspired by Fullwiley’s hands on teaching tactics, echoes Branches sentiments. “She’s incredibly intelligent and a wonderful mentor. She’s also been very helpful with the fieldwork, and I couldn’t help but coming back to do 91r with her. She definitely perfectly embodies the ideal of what an up and coming professor should be.” CORRECTION The April 28 magazine article "15 Faculty Hot Shots: Duana Fullwiley" incorrectly stated that Duana Fullwiley founded “The Committee of Social Engagement” in the Department of African and African American Studies. In fact, that committee was founded by department chair Evelyn B. Higginbotham.

I had eaten everything from vegan bacon to blood sausage. Now it was time to seek a new holy grail of culinary extremes: a cuisine hot enough to hurt me.I wanted to sear away my taste buds. I wanted tears to stream out of my eyes. I wanted something more wicked than wasabi and more nuanced than Tabasco. What I wanted, in short, was real Thai food.The kind of Thai food served in the average Cambridge Thai restaurant caters to a mild palate. I was afraid that if I tackled the meal alone, waiters would not take my request seriously. I needed, in journalism parlance, a “fixer”: a sage who could nimbly guide me through a forest of unfamiliar names and progressively more exotic forms of heat.He came in the form of Anthropology Professor Michael Herzfeld. After having done fieldwork in Thailand, he was a foodie fluent in the language of spice, and spoke of Thai pepppers, mysterious things literally translated as “mouse shit” peppers. (In Thai, “shit” is used as an intensifier.) He also showed photos of curries that would make people raised on boiled potatoes convulse in fear.Called “phrik khii nuu,” the Thai “mouse shit” pepper is rated on the Scoville Scale as very hot, with a Scoville Rating of 50,000 to 100,000. The scale measures the spice’s amount of Capsaicin, the chemical compound responsible for all that is burning, tingling, and masochistic about eating spicy food. Law enforcement-grade pepper spray clocks in at an SR rating of 500,000–5,300,000.Just as marathon runners run, I began a training regimen of a Thai-style hot sauce called Sriracha, served in the dining halls as a squeeze bottle with a green nozzle. My 8 a.m. wake-ups included breakfast pizza slathered in hot sauce. After two weeks of this, I escalated the pain by slapping on habanero Tabasco at abandon in addition to Sriracha. Herzfeld picked a Thai restaurant in Harvard Square called Aiyara (16 Eliot St., 617-497-8288), formerly named Smile Thai Cafe until it switched hands recently. He deemed its food “about as close to the real thing as I’ve ever eaten Stateside.” So on an ordinary Monday night, I went to Aiyara with my taste buds at a lifetime apex of pain tolerance.Herzfeld made his way across Mass. Ave with his wife Mia and Professor Theodore C. Bestor, who teaches Social Analysis 70: “Food and Culture.” He sported a small moustache and an accent cultivated across the pond. Herzfeld greeted the waiter with a small bow, hands pressed together. He then ordered in Thai.“The hottest food you get in America is unlikely to be as particularly hot as in Thailand,” Herzfeld warned me.We started off with bowls of tom yum soup, filled with shrimp and slices of mushroom. Small chili flakes and a smattering of mean-looking oil floated about ominously on its surface.The meal began abysmally. With my first mouthful, I choked on some chili flakes and spent a few minutes sputtering and speechless. Herzfeld’s wife handed me some Kleenex.I had tripped on the starting line. Thankfully, the next two dishes—a beef satay with peanut sauce and “Tod Man Pla,” or fish cakes—were not spicy. I had ample time to recover.In the meantime, Herzfeld imparted bits of Thai food trivia. The spicier Thai food got, he explained, the more you could taste the underlying ingredient.“The metaphor I like is a fireworks display: an initial explosion followed by a fireworks display of the various flavors of the different spices,” Herzfeld said.If in the course of adventurous eating you get burned, stay away from water. “Water weakens your saliva,” Herzfeld said. “If you’re being burned by something spicy, the trick is to eat rice.”We then started on a platter of “Nua Yang Nam Tok,” or Waterfall Beef. The recipe calls for fish sauce and ground dried red chilis. I took a bite.It had a bit of a kick, but I didn’t find it painful at all.This was followed by a dish of green papaya salad, composed of long shreds of papaya with bean sprouts, green beans, shrimp, and peanuts, then dusted in ground chili. This was significantly spicier, like Ashlee Simpson, post-punk makeover. It actually got spicier as it cooled. I ate it with sticky rice served in a small woven container.Noting that I had not collapsed, Herzfeld requested that our dishes be made spicier. “He’s worried about her,” Herzfeld said of the waiter’s trepidation. Maybe I should have worn khakis and combat boots instead of a skirt. Then came a trio of delicious but unfrightening dishes: penang, with carrots, peas, and strips of chicken in a red curry, then ground chicken with basil (I doused it in sodium-laden fish sauce), and finally, “Stir Fry of a Shit Drunk Man.” You know, drunken noodles.I wasn’t sure whether to feel disappointed or victorious. The food had definitely not been nuclear spicy, so I decided to make a final run for culinary extremes. I fished out a few infamous Thai “mouse shit” peppers from the pot of fish sauce. I popped them straight into my mouth.The two professors looked at me expectantly. I chewed. And swallowed.The burn was not a lot worse than a hit of Sriracha. They looked impressed. But later, as my body tried to digest the banquet, my stomach tingled and shuddered, a little angry at the introduction of straight-up chili pepper. I was proud. I felt that much more authentic.

Maya R. Jasanoff ’96 might be in exactly the same place she was just over ten years ago, but she’s certainly come a long way. Once a History and Literature concentrator and Adams resident, and now an Associate Professor in the History Department, Jasanoff has only begun to make her mark on Harvard.On the way from her cozy Adams dorm room to her current office in the Center for European Studies, Jasanoff managed to earn a Masters at Oxford, a Ph.D. at Yale, publish her first book (with a second on the way), earn a fellowship at the Michigan Society of Fellows, and spend a few years teaching at the University of Virginia.While this fast-paced track into academia might seem intimidating to some, it came naturally to Jasanoff.  “I always loved history and I loved writing and I loved traveling and I loved reading, and by the time you add all that stuff up there’s only so many things you can do,” says Jasanoff, who has traveled to over 50 countries.She adds that both her parents are professors, so she became familiar with the career early on. “I grew up...knowing that it was going to be really hard for me to have a job going from 9 to 5, to have a boss, having little control over what I did with my day.”Julie Zikherman ’96, Jasanoff’s former roommate in Adams, says she wasn’t at all surprised by Jasanoff’s career path.  “Some of the fun that she has in history has to do with telling stories and she’s clearly always loved that, and she does that now full time,” Zikherman says.Though this is only Jasanoff’s second year teaching at Harvard, she came having made a name for herself and has been seen as an important addition to the History Department.  “She’s been a star for a long time, lots of people have known about her,” fellow History Professor David R. Armitage says of Jasanoff’s reputation in the history world.Jasanoff is especially interested in the question of cultural mixing, which she explores through her research on modern British history and British imperialism.  Her first book, “Edge of Empire,” examines how the British and French expanded in India and the Middle East through the lives of art collectors. “I felt like they were on the frontiers of cultural exchange,” Jasanoff explains.This ability to analyze history through unique perspectives and narratives has garnered Jasanoff great respect. “She breaks boundaries between national histories and between European countries and their empires,” Armitage says. “She is a beautiful writer and a wonderful speaker.”It’s no surprise then, that even Jasanoff’s 10 a.m. lectures are consistently full. Furthermore, students in Jasanoff’s lectures aren’t often found Facebook stalking or Gchatting, but listening and note-taking. Jasanoff enjoys using narratives and stories in her lectures, explaining, “I try to tell stories because I think it’s important to capture something about human experience in the past.”William C. Quinn ’10 calls Jasanoff one of the best lecturers he’s ever had at Harvard, citing her engaging use of narratives, anecdotes, and multimedia in History 1224: “Britain Since 1760: Island, Europe, Empire.” “She uses PowerPoint, but she actually knows how to use PowerPoint,” Quinn says, recalling clips from Churchill speeches and music by The Clash that were incorporated into her lectures.Jasanoff’s friends and colleagues call her humorous yet analytical, accessible and engaging yet focused on her research, original but still realistic. It is her ability to intertwine work and life that enables her to maintain such an ideal balance. “There are scholars who are hard working and there are scholars who are talented,” says Jasanoff’s friend and Harvard Society Junior Fellow Sam Haselby. “Maya Jasanoff is both hardworking and talented.”

While much of Assistant Professor of Geochemistry Sujoy Mukhopadhyay’s work might seem rather esoteric—he uses noble gasses as geochemical tracers to study the Earth’s processes and history—his research findings may help scientists understand everything from global warming to desertification in Africa.Colleagues say that Mukhopadhyay is not the type to focus on one specific interest or area of research. Instead, he uses noble gasses—a group of inert, unreactive elements—as a tool to study a variety of geologic processes.“If he was just doing what he has been doing in any one of [the research fields] individually, he’d still be widely respected,” says Robert Ackert, an Earth and Planetary Sciences research associate. “I think his strength is that he does a number of things very well.”As a student, Mukhopadhyay says he loved studying chemistry but was wary of becoming a pure chemist. Yet, because his father had been a field geologist in India, he did not want to study geology either. “Marrying chemistry to understanding the earth,” he says, provided the perfect fit and allowed him to reconcile his interests.Mukhopadhyay says he remembers his interest in noble gas geochemistry being piqued as a graduate student at the California Institute of Technology. An advisor was using the interplanetary dust particles that have been settling on the Earth’s surface throughout its history as a way to reconstruct past variations in climate. They found that helium-3—a rare noble gas isotope that is extremely depleted on Earth—proved to be a good tracer for the dust particles.“If you imagine material from space is raining down at a constant rate, and you measure the amount, you can basically figure out time,” he says.Today, Mukhopadhyay says he spends half his time trying to understand processes deep in the Earth’s interior and the other half understanding surface processes. The two, he says, are intimately connected, although perhaps not on a human time scale.In one recent research project, Mukhopadhyay used noble gas concentrations in ocean coral off the coast of Africa as a way of tracking how dust emission rates have changed in response to climate variation. Because the drying of the Northern African Sahel region has caused widespread famine in recent decades, Mukhopadhyay says his research may be useful in understanding how further climate change will affect the region in the future.In addition to being an incisive and broad-ranging researcher, Mukhopadhyay also teaches Earth and Planetary Sciences 7, the department’s introductory course on geological sciences. Several students who have taken his courses praised his enthusiasm and sense of humor, his accessibility, and his dedication to teaching.He has twice led undergraduate research field trips to Hawaii, and he has traveled to Antarctica for field studies as well—a “magical” experience that he says helped him understand the impact of melting ice sheets on rising sea levels and increased ocean temperatures.While Mukhopadhyay is not yet a tenured professor, he says that he plans on staying at Harvard for at least the next few years, and that he truly enjoys interacting with students in addition to teaching and working in his lab.“I feel I’m contributing to generating a more informed citizenry. But on a more personal level, I find it very satisfying when you explain something to students, and all of a sudden a light bulb goes off,” Mukhopadhyay says. “What I’ve been doing has been a lot of fun.”

With cropped blond hair, a lanky frame and a contagious smile, Assistant Professor Adam E. Cohen ’01 hardly looks like a “mad scientist.” In fact, at first glance, this 29-year-old appears more like an undergraduate than a professor of Chemistry and Chemical Biology and Physics.  
Though Cohen has a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge, and another one in Experimental Physics from Stanford, he is more inclined to boast about his goofy videos on complex scientific topics than about his pedigree. One such video shows particles under the influence of an electrical waveform synchronized to the beat of “Move It, Move It.” Bopping his head to the beat, Cohen successfully pulls off the seemingly unthinkable: a techno/physics fusion.  
Cohen’s youthful spirit permeates into the classroom, where undergraduate and graduate students marvel at the energy of this up-and-coming science star. Anna V. Shneidman ’09, a student in Cohen’s fall term Chemistry 163: “Frontiers in Biophysics,” noted his “enthusiasm and childlike wonder with scientific questions.”  
Cohen launched his teaching career at Harvard last year and began teaching Chemistry 163 in the fall of 2008 to a group of sixteen students. Currently, he is taking a break from the classroom to focus on his lab work. The Cohen lab is devoted to investigating molecules and cells using physical tools. Tucked away in the maze-like halls of Mallinckrodt, his lab is the ultimate science nerd’s dream, filled with gadgets, robots, and a 2500 pound table floating on nitrogen filled air sacs.  
While some may consider his area of expertise arcane, Cohen’s admirers praise his exceptional ability to explain complex material to the average person. His older sister, Zoe S. Cohen ’98 applauds his ability to translate his esoteric specialty into “something that makes it interesting and fun for other people.” 
Though Cohen’s age may make him particularly able to identify so well with his students, his passion for his work seems to resonate above all else. 
With a twinkle in his eye, Cohen recounts his scientific endeavors from childhood—which extended way beyond the average basement lab kit.
“I built an electronics lab in my bedroom, most of which has been moved into my lab here,” Cohen says.
He gushes about one of his favorite creations, a device that applies physics to allow his eye movements to maneuver his computer cursor. And that one, he built before college.  
Taking a break from Chemistry 163, Cohen says that his next foray into the classroom will be in the spring of 2010 as a professor for the introductory chemistry and physics course, Physical Sciences 1: “Chemical Bonding, Energy, and Reactivity: an Introduction to the Physical Sciences.” Accustomed to a lax grading system given Chemistry 163’s largely graduate student population, Cohen admits, “I’ll probably have to be more of a hard-ass.”  
But while a bevy of premeds may get to reap the benefits of Cohen’s next venture, his former students lament Cohen’s absence from Chemistry 163. According to Bradlee D. Nelms, a graduate student who took the course, “Chem 163 was one of the best classes I’ve taken at Harvard.”

It’s 3:07 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon, and Sever 106 is filled with the lively chatter of students in English 192p: “Postmodern Literature.” Glenda R. Carpio, associate professor of African and African American Studies and of English, is dressed in a fitted black suit with red embroidery, her dark curls swept into a ponytail. She begins to speak, but her words are devoured by the noise. Seconds later, she picks up her pace and volume, and silence falls over  the room—it’s clear that she is the master of the classroom with her spunk and congeniality.
Upon her graduation from Vassar in 1991, Carpio began teaching fourth and eighth grades through Teach for America, an endeavor that, she admits, was challenging. “But I realized that if you put your soul into it, it’s really enriching,” Carpio explains. After holding teaching positions at various universities, Carpio came to Harvard in 2002 and immediately impressed students with her passion for literature.
“Professor Carpio is fantastic,” says Monica W. Zhou ’12, who was so taken by Carpio’s charisma during shopping period that she enrolled in English 192p without any previous knowledge of postmodernism. Carpio’s popularity is known amongst students and faculty alike. “She must rank as a ‘cult professor’ with a big following,” says Werner Sollors, a professor in both the  English and African and African American Studies departments. “She should patent her method.”
And her popularity doesn’t stem from teaching easy material—hers is Harvard’s only course that teaches Thomas Pynchon’s notoriously daunting novel “Gravity’s Rainbow” to freshmen. “I absolutely respect Professor Carpio for attacking such a difficult book. Making challenging texts accessible really speaks to her teaching ability,” says Sabrina A. Sadique, a teaching fellow for English 192p.
Carpio’s teaching prowess is undeniable. She was the recipient of Harvard University’s Abramson Award for Excellence and Sensitivity in Undergraduate Teaching in 2007. “She is extremely vivacious and she makes you feel comfortable in the class,” says Sadique. With her impressive CUE ratings—none of which fall below 4.0—Carpio is a standout member of the Harvard faculty. 
“You get a sense that she’s in love with the texts, which you don’t find with most professors,” explains Jasper N. Henderson ’12.
Carpio, who was born in Guatemala but immigrated to New York as a child, is involved with student life beyond the classroom as a faculty advisor for Fuerza Latina, a campus organization dedicated to providing emotional and academic support for Harvard’s Latino community. “It’s a kind of connection with students where they can come talk about profiling Latino culture at Harvard,” she notes. 
It’s no surprise that for Carpio, a self-professed “hodgepodge” of ethnicities, understanding race and culture are a crucial part of academic work as well. In 2008, Oxford University Press published her book, “Laughing Fit to Kill: Black Humor in the Fictions of Slavery.” 
“Humor is such an under-theorized field, but its also such a significant aspect of our human experience,” says Carpio. “I hope [my book] helps people think through what America’s racial and sexual stereotypes are and how they operate in culture.” She is currently working on a book on black narrative and poetry of Latin America.
Talent and intellect aside, Carpio also possesses a physical beauty that is difficult to ignore. “She’s a really attractive woman with a fantastic fashion sense,”  Henderson says. “She has a distinctive style that I think is part of her being a rising star. She’s very hip and knows what’s going on.” This professor just might be cooler than her own students.

While Professors of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Gonzalo Giribet and Cassandra Extavour specialize in the decidedly non-human, when it comes to connecting to their students, they seem to have things under control.
Described collectively as “badasses” by a number of their students, Giribet and Extavour comprise the teaching team behind the class Organismic and Evolutionary Biology 51: “Biology and Evolution of Invertebrate Animals,” a class that combines their two specialties and amplifies what many of their students characterize as the professors’ intense dedication to their teaching.
GIRIBET

Giribet’s work has taken him everywhere from New England to Australia, Sri Lanka, and Catalonia. In each location, he looks for specimens and uses his findings to infer the evolutionary history of families and phylums. “We have two main projects right now,” says Giribet. “In one we’re looking into more details of how the families and phylums relate to each other, and in the other we’re looking into the big relationship between all the major lineages.”
He and his team conduct extensive fieldwork to classify invertebrate organisms in an effort to better understand how living things are evolutionarily related. “I take my students with me,” says Giribet, who affirms that firsthand experience with organisms is an essential part of studying OEB. “I took several graduate students, as well as an undergraduate student, to New Zealand a few years ago.”
 But while he states this matter-of-factly, as if to suggest that these opportunities for undergraduates are a must, Sebastian Velez, who is a teaching fellow for Giribet and has worked in his lab for the past two years, asserts that Giribet’s dedication is not particularly common. “I don’t know many professors who will sacrifice their Spring Break to teach students,” he says, referring to the trip to Panama that Giribet has offered yearly to the students enrolled in OEB 51.  
While Velez describes Giribet as an “excellent teacher,” what most impresses him is Giribet’s abundance of energy. “He’ll wake up before everyone and go running, and then still get more done throughout that day than anyone else. When everyone is dog-tired from scuba diving and collecting and identifying organisms, he’s still awake working. We’ll all go to bed at eleven and he’ll stay up until one…and then still wake up before us. He’s the one bringing everyone up,” says Velez.

EXTAVOUR 

While Velez praises Giribet for his dedication, in her two years at Harvard, Extavour has also earned the respect and praise of many of her students. “She injured her rib at some point on the trip,” recalls Cameron D. Kirk-Giannini ’11, referring to the 2009 Panama trip he attended. “But she was so badass about it. She kept doing what everyone else was doing.”
Cindy J. Liu ’09, another student of Giribet and Extavour’s, praises Extavour’s dedication and adds that she is impressed by the professor’s vast knowledge of the field. “This is the first time the class has been taught with Professor Extavour, but she is very knowledgeable, and sets up especially good labs,” says Liu.
 Extavour’s lab focuses on early embryonic development, and devotes more energy to observing the intricacies of germ cells than to the larger organisms in which Giribet specializes. “She creates an excellent environment in the lab,” says Franz Kainz, a graduate student who has worked with Extavour since July 2007. “We’re extremely productive but it’s still a great environment,” he adds. 

COMING TOGETHER
While the class was initially conceived and taught by Giribet, soon after she arrived at Harvard, Extavour approached him about co-teaching so that she might be able to contribute her unique perspective. Giribet, who specializes in invertebrates, embraced Extavour’s focus on embryonic development and began teaching the course with her this year.
The two professors are in accord on the benefits of instructing on evolution together. “It’s been great to co-teach,” says Giribet, “you can bring much more expertise to the classroom.”
 Students also appreciate the depth of knowledge the two bring to the table. “The things they teach go really well together,” says Kirk-Giannini. “Its one of my favorite classes, one of the best I’ve ever taken.”
With the professors’ outstanding dedication, rave reviews, and trips to Panama, it’s no surprise Kirk-Giannini feels as he does. Watch out professors: looks like you may be getting way more than 15 students next year.

Two pre-frosh panels yesterday focused not on academics at the College or a particular student organization, but on a lesser known element of Harvard student life: sex.The larger event, entitled “Sex at Harvard,” showcased a compilation of student groups that focused on sex-related issues, including True Love Revolution, H-Bomb, and Harvard Men Against Rape. The panel attracted about 40 prospective students, filling a packed Sever Hall classroom.“We promote a positive philosophy about sex where we find great meaning and beauty in the act of sex,” said Leo J. Keliher ’10, president of True Love Revolution, the student advocacy group that promotes premarital abstinence. Keliher was seated next to Brandon T. Perkovich ’11, the president of H-Bomb, Harvard’s student-run sex magazine. Perkovich emphasized the importance of encouraging an open dialogue about sexual relations on campus.“We believe we’re at a unique crossroads in history,” Perkovich said. “Sex has never been quite so visible or quite so dangerous.” The seven-person panel began with a question from Sarah Rankin, director of the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, who asked the audience to guess how many sexual partners the average Harvard student has in a year.Only a handful of attendees guessed zero, but Rankin listed statistics from the National College Health Assessment at Harvard which reported that 42% of respondents had zero sexual partners in the last academic year, 31% had one, and 10% had two.The discussion covered a range of topics including sexual assault prevention, final clubs, contraceptives, and the queer community. Scott D. Kominers ’09, a representative for the Harvard Men Against Rape, said that while it may be difficult to find students at Harvard who are “pro-rape,” sexual assaults do still occur on campus.OSAPR Student Ally Alexandra N. Bolm ’09 added that OSAPR does not intend to promote “fear tactics” at the panel.“We’re trying to foster really respectful relationships between people, whether it’s for one night or whether it’s for years,” Bolm said.Harvard College Queer Students and Allies Co-Chair Marco Chan ’11 attended both the student group panel and a second panel exclusively devoted to queer issues.The smaller queer life event yesterday afternoon included student and staff panelists who emphasized the size of Harvard’s queer community and the school’s “queer-friendly” environment.“There are more homosexual people in here than I’ve ever met in my entire life,” said Ethan R. Pierce, a pre-frosh from a small town in Maine who added that he only knows two gay people at his high school of 800 students. But panelists also made a point to discuss queer students who remain uninvolved with the QSA but are still considered members of the queer community.“There are people who accept sexuality and desire but don’t think of it as the locus of their identity,” QSA Secretary Christian L. Garland ’10 said.—Staff writer Danielle J. Kolin can be reached at dkolin@fas.harvard.edu.

A new blood test developed by Professor Amin I. Kassis of Harvard Medical School may be able to detect several different types of cancer far sooner and more accurately than current cancer screening methods allow.The test is in early stages of development and will take at least five years to be ready for public use, Kassis said, although limited availability is possible in two years. “It all depends on continued funding, although we are confident that the project will attract the necessary grants,” he said.“We’ve been working on this test for two years now, and results from testing on laboratory mice have been very encouraging,” said Pichumani Balagurumoorthy, a research fellow in Kassis’ lab. While testing with human subjects has only just begun, Balagurumoorthy said, the first few of such tests have corroborated earlier findings.“All existing blood tests for cancer are ineffective, with high false positives and false negatives,” Kassis said. “As a result, patients are prescribed inappropriate treatment.”Kassis’ test looks to circulating tumor cells—any tumor, no matter how small, sheds tumor cells into the bloodstream. These cells typically die on their own, and are cleaned up by phagocytes—a type of white blood cell. The test examines whether markers of ingested tumor cells are detectable in the patient’s phagocytes. The results are then compared to an non-phagocytic white blood cells, such as lymphocytes. Kassis said that he conceived of this approach due to his background in immunology. While this field is typically far removed from radiology, he had a detailed knowledge of it from earlier in his career.Tests so far have had a 100 percent rate of success; Kassis said that while both human and mice testing had proven unerring in detecting the right kind of cancer, early-detection has yet to be tested in humans.Kassis has just returned from presenting the work at the annual meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research.“The reaction was simply fabulous,” he said. “When you present an idea, people usually come to you with problems and objections. But when we showed them this test, everyone said, “this makes sense”. They were floored by its logical simplicity.”S. James Adelstein, a professor of medical biophysics at HMS, said that while this is an exciting project, it is too early to assess its impact on the field. “There have been only a few human tests, and while these have been encouraging, Dr. Kassis has so far only examined a small gene array,” he said. Adelstein added that potential uses of the test include testing for cancer in patients who have previously suffered from it.

Former Kennedy School Faculty member Kurt Campbell recently became the latest in a litany of Harvard affiliates to be tapped for a position in the Obama Administration.Campbell, the CEO and Co-Founder of the Center for a New American Security—a moderate national security think tank, has been nominated as the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs. His nomination follows the appointments of seventeen members from the Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, according to the Belfer Center’s spring newsletter.Prior to founding CNAS with Belfer Center colleague Michele Flournoy—the White House’s current undersecretary of defense for policy—Campbell served as an associate professor of Public Policy and International Relations at the Kennedy School. He was also the assistant director of the Belfer Center.Currently, Campbell holds leadership positions at a variety of prominent political organizations in Washington, including the Aspen Strategy Group, StratAsia, and the Washington Quarterly. He has previously served in government in a variety of capacities, and received the Department of Defense Medals for Distinguished Public Service and for Outstanding Public Service for his contributions.Campbell received overwhelming support for his nomination from his Harvard colleagues, some of whom have served with him both at the Kennedy School and in Washington for decades.“[Campbell] has been a thoughtful, reflective student of Asia for two decades,” wrote Belfer Center Director and Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison Jr. in an e-mail on Saturday.Allison, who originally hired Campbell as an assistant professor at the Kennedy School, has known Campbell for 20 years. His sentiments were echoed by Professor Ashton B. Carter, a Belfer Center member who has also known Campbell for two decades and was confirmed as the Pentagon’s Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics Sunday morning.Both professors noted that the challenges of Campbell’s new position would include Asia’s growing role in the global economy and China’s potential future ability to challenge American dominance. They both added that Campbell’s extensive experience, insight, and respect within the region made him more than capable for the job.“I have the greatest respect for his ability, and also his integrity,” Carter said.

Last week, The American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) announced its 2009 class of fellows and foreign honorary members which included 17 Harvard professors. The Academy chose its 231 new members from the sciences, the humanities, the arts, business, public affairs, and the non profit sector. 
The AAAS is unique in that it is both a prestigious honorary society as well as an independent research institute that “undertakes studies of complex and emerging problems,” according to a statement issued by the Academy. 
“We conduct research on a broad range of pressing societal issues and we draw on our members across all the disciplines to participate in that research program,” said Paul Karoff, a spokesperson for AAAS. 
“This is obviously a very prestigious honour,” Karoff said, adding that the Academy’s multi-disciplinary and multi-professional nature is unique in allowing interaction between leaders from various fields. 
“The individuals selected for membership are people who are identified as having made very significant contributions both in their field as well as often times to society at large,” Karoff said. 
Jamaica Kincaid, a visiting lecturer on African and American Studies at Harvard and one of the newly-elected members, said she was “very touched and honoured” to receive the recognition. 
Kincaid’s primary focus is the skill of writing, which comprises her courses at Harvard.
“One of the wonderful things that Harvard offers is an elective and these are the courses I usually teach,” she said.
Harvard Law School Professor Michael J. Klarman, another of the new honorees, said the award is likely due to his book “From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality,” which won the Bancroft Prize in 2005.
“I am pretty sure that if the academy was interested in any aspect of my work it would have been that,” he said.
“I am especially impressed by the class of people I am going in with, a lot of which I have been huge admirers of,” Klarman added, pointing to James McPherson—whom he described as “one of the best civil war historians ever”—and Nelson Mandela, who was elected as a Foreign Honorary Member.
“That takes your breath away,” Klarman said.
Steven Shapin, a History of Science professor who was also elected, said he will “continue to do teaching research and writing as much as I have been.” 
He added, “I just look forward with pleasure to becoming a member of what seems to be a very distinguished body.”
The newly elected members are to be formally inducted into the AAAS in a ceremony in October.

A group of scientists—including one Harvard professor—have discovered the furthest known object in the universe, Gamma-Ray Burst 090423, after it was detection by NASA’s Swift telescope last Thursday morning.
The object is 13.1 billion light years away and is thought to have been caused by the death of a massive star and the birth of a black hole, according to Edo Berger, an assistant professor of astronomy. 
“It is further than any other known object,” he said.
The group of scientists that discovered the distance of this object include Berger, of the Harvard Center for Astrophysics, Derek A. Fox from Penn State University, and Nino Cucchiara, one of Fox’s students. This distance has since been confirmed by scientists from around the world.
Research into gamma-ray bursts fosters the understanding of the early universe according to Astronomy Professor Johnathan E. Grindlay.
“They are a brief period of illumination looking back in time,” he said 
This particular gamma-ray burst’s redshift of 8.2 corresponds to such a large distance that it indicates the presence of stars a mere 630 million years after the Big Bang—when the universe was just 5 percent of its current age. 
“We are still trying to figure out all the implications ourselves,” Fox said.
This area of research has potential huge implications for the discovery exactly when the first stars formed in the universe.
“We are very excited about it,” Grindlay said. “We didn’t doubt gamma-ray bursts could be at such an early time in the universe, but this confirms it.”
Various groups are proposing NASA missions that would further investigate such phenomena, including Harvard’s Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) and Penn State’s Joint Astrophysics and Nascent Universe Satellite (JANUS).
The autonomous space-based telescope Swift, which detected the gamma-ray burst, was launched in 2004 in order to help scientists further the understand of these objects.

Yesterday afternoon, the American Physical Society designated Harvard’s Jefferson Laboratory as a Historic Site, citing the special role that it and the Harvard Physics department have played in encouraging physical sciences education. 
In a crowded Jefferson 250, Harvard President Drew G. Faust was presented with a rectangular plaque by APS President Cherry A. Murray, who is also the incoming dean of the newly-minted School for Engineering and Applied Sciences. 
The decision to choose Jefferson Laboratory was made by the APS nominating committee. Murray said the committee saw Jefferson as an obvious pick thanks to its deep history. 
Opening its doors in 1884, Jefferson was not only one of the oldest physics buildings in the nation, but also one of the first buildings to be created for both research and education. 
“This was really the beginning of the research institution,” Murray said. “That is pretty impressive.”
In Faust’s acceptance speech, she quoted laboratory founder Professor John Trowbridge, who said in 1877, “The department of physics in a university must embrace both teaching and investigation. If it is given up entirely to teaching, the cause of science suffers, and the object of a University which is founded both to teach and increase the sum of human knowledge is defeated.” 
Faust explained that because the faculty of the physics department has continued to hold this idea close, the plaque really belongs to the inhabitants of the Jefferson building, not just the structure. 
“Today’s ceremony honors a building,” she said. “But what matters most is the people who inhabit the building.”
And those denizens have made great strides in the field over the years, including Wallace C. Sabine, who pioneered the field of architectural acoustics, and Theodore Lyman, who discovered the Lyman series, which characterizes hydrogen electron transitions between different energy states. 
“[We are] hoping that these plaques will help students walking by the building to think of physics and the history of physics.”

The panel discussion “Protecting the Right to a Home: the Anti-foreclosure Movement in Boston and Beyond” examined Boston foreclosures from a human rights perspective yesterday evening at the Law School. 
The discussion mainly served to celebrate the achievements of two grassroots organizations—City Life/Vida Urbana and the Harvard Law School student-run organization, No One Leaves. Jacqueline Bhabha, the executive director of Harvard’s Committee on Human Rights Studies, moderated the event. 
Bhabha began by briefly discussing the issue of home foreclosure and eviction with respect to American law. 
“The notion that individuals have a right to a home is somehow strangely absent,” she said. 
According to Bhabha, lacking a home violates a number of human rights.
In Boston, the rate of home foreclosure has risen dramatically in the past three years. Faced with what seemed like no alternatives, many tenants who were foreclosed upon accepted “cash for keys” deals, in which the bank paid the occupant a small sum in return for the occupant signing away the legal right to remain in the home. 
City Life/Vida Urbana and No One Leaves have been raising awareness about other alternatives by canvassing from door to door. In the past two years, no tenant working with City Life has been evicted.
“If we can get enough people to stay in their homes, eventually someone is going to pay attention” said Nicholas Hartigan, a co-founder of No One Leaves. 
Melonie Griffiths-Evans, a CityLife/Vida Urbana organizer, recounted her personal experience with foreclosure. Before receiving help from CityLife/Vida Urbana, Griffiths-Evans said that she felt that she had no other option but to enter a homeless shelter. But CityLife/Vida Urbana barricaded her home to prevent the bank from evicting her and her family. Ultimately the bank entered into negotiations with Griffiths-Evans. 
“It was huge for me, seeing that my voice could be used in non-traditonal ways to effect traditional ways of doing things,” Griffiths-Evans said.

Harvard’s business and medical schools are top in the nation once again, according to rankings published by U.S. News and World Report.The medical school dominated the “research” category—with a overall score of 100, versus the second-place school, Johns Hopkins, at 81.Jules L. Dienstag, Dean for Medical Education, said that she was proud but took the rankings with a grain of salt.“While we are heartened by this news, we do not believe that such ranking systems capture the full scope of the student experience,” she said. “Like all our peers, we are constantly striving to improve and augment educational and research opportunities in order to better fulfill our mission.” The medical school came in 15th in primary care.The business school was able to take sole ownership of the top spot after tying with Stanford last year.“It is great that Harvard was ranked so highly in the survey, as any time your school gets positive reinforcement it’s a good thing,” said M. Scott Daubin, co-president of the Harvard Business School Student Association.Patrick S. Chun, the other co-president of the association, said that the school is taking steps to stay relevant in the modern world.“It’s ironic that industry pundits look more negatively toward business schools while applications increase,” he said.Students at Harvard College said that the tougher job market is bolstering interest in attending graduate schools.“There has been an increase in applicants to medical schools, and an increase in Harvard students switching their concentrations to pre-med, hoping to avoid Wall Street,” said Christine W. Li ’10, president of the Harvard Premedical Society. Nimi P. Katragadda ’10, co-president of the Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business, said she has noticed a similar bump in enthusiasm for business school.Harvard Law School was ranked second in the nation, behind Yale, and the school of education was ranked sixth.U.S. News’ ranking methodology uses peer assessments, standardized test scores, acceptance rates, and other metrics to assess the schools.  The magazine presents data from over 1500 academic institutions.

Students looking for an alternative to Blodgett Pool this spring can head over to the Charles River, now that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency gave the historic river a “B+” rating in a recent press release concerning water quality monitoring. 
The report’s findings, which deem the Charles safe for swimming and boating, is a direct result of the Clean Charles Initiative, a program enacted in 1995 after the EPA gave the Charles a “D” rating. 
The “B+” rating may help dispel rumors that peg the Charles as an unsanitary source of water for recreation, to the relief of students who often use the river for co-curricular activities. 
“It makes the whole experience a lot more pleasurable if the water’s nice and [clean],” said heavyweight rower Anthony P. Locke ’11. “We end up jumping in a lot of the time and it’s nice to know the river is actually clean despite all the rumors that have circulated.”
According to the press release, the agency’s grading system is based on the number of days that the Charles River has met Massachusetts boating and swimming standards, which is determined by bacterial levels. 
Currently, the main concern with the river is that it may have too many nutrients such as phosphorus, which is a far cry from the issues the river faced over a decade ago. 
The Charles has been a key resource to Harvard’s outdoors community—hosting boat races including the Head of the Charles Regatta, and the annual Polar Bear Swim, an annual event in which Alaska Klub members jump into the river despite Cambridge’s freezing winter temperatures. 
News of a healthy and environmentally friendly water resource may increase the river’s recreational uses as Cambridge slowly edges into the summer months. 
“I think there’s a pretty good chance I’ll make my way down there [again] now that we know it’s safe,” said Matthew L. Sundquist ’09, who has jumped in the river on three separate occasions. “It’s a nice river and we have a lot of access to it. It’s good to know it’s being taken care of.”

City Manager Robert W. Healy and his team presented the initial draft of Cambridge’s fiscal year 2010 budget yesterday, which projected a 2 percent increase over the adjusted 2009 budget.
Healy attributed the increase, which he called the most modest in the city’s recent past, to the rising cost of salaries for city employees, pension costs, and employee health insurance. 
The budget proposal includes an increase in property tax in order to make up for a $8.7 million reduction in state aid to Cambridge. The tax increase comes on the heels of a similar bump last year.
The city councillors, who will hold the first budget hearing Thursday, emphasized the importance of a budget that reflects the changing sources of revenue and costs which the city must balance during challenging economic times.
“It’s a moving target and I think from day to day, you can’t really know how you’ll be balancing the budget. We’ll probably be adopting a budget without knowing all the facts,” Councillor David P. Maher said.
Of the operating budget’s approximately $444 million available for allocation, roughly $134 million has been set aside for Cambridge’s schools in fiscal year 2010, a slight increase over last year’s expenditure on school operating costs. 
Residents raised concerns about the transparency of the School Department’s budget. 
“It is incomprehensible, you can’t see how money is allocated to or within schools at all. This allows for abuse of spending within the school administration as well as inequality amongst schools,” said resident Timothy K. Cutler.
Mayor E. Denise Simmons defended the school committee’s effort to improve the budget’s readability. 
“[The budget] is very explicit about what it is, what it does, and where the allocations are made. It’s very difficult when people say they want a transparent budget but don’t say what that means or looks like,” she said.
The council voted to include a public comment section for the School Committee’s Monday roundtable meeting in order to try to address this concern.

College students all across the country looking to partake in national service upon graduation will receive greater economic support from the recently authorized Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act.
Largely the brainchild of Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56, the act aims to dramatically bolster the number of college graduates who opt to participate in national service.
“This is the most sweeping expansion of national service in over 75 years,” said Sandy Scott, spokesman for the Corporation for National and Community Service. “It would put AmeriCorps on a path to grow from 75,000 volunteers to 250,000 volunteers by 2017.”
This service act seeks to encourage those who are deterred by recent financial setbacks to nevertheless consider national service opportunities such as Teach for America and the Peace Corps. It will increase the amount of money provided to students by raising the value of the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award—created to allow those pursuing service opportunities to simultaneously pay off their college loans—from $4,775 to $5,350 per year.
“While Teach for America participants receive salaries which vary from region to region,” said Lumumba B. Seegars ’09, a campus representative for Teach for America, “These AmeriCorps funds provide educational grants to participants in national service to pay off previous loans.”
In the wake of the recent economic downturn, Scott said this act will support AmeriCorps’ focus on five pressing issues—educational achievement, health care access, clean energy, support of veterans, and economic opportunities. 
In addition to the authorization of the new act, AmeriCorps has already received approximately $200 million as part of President Obama’s stimulus package, which have been used to recruit up to 13,000 new positions.
With the number of applications to AmeriCorps’ state and national programs increasing roughly 8 percent from 2007 to 2008, this expansionary act comes at a time when more and more graduates are seeking to partake in national service.
“This legislation is coming at a critical time not only due to the social problems facing Americans, but also because of the recent compassion boom,” Scott said. “Due to both President Obama’s call to service and the extremely bleak job market, today’s generation of young people are a very altruistic and service-minded generation.”

A study conducted by Shakira F. Suglia at the Harvard School of Public Health has shown that adolescents who have witnessed violence may be more likely to suffer from adverse health effects later in life. The study, which observed 15 boys and 28 girls ranging from 7-13 years old, was conducted in an unidentified urban neighborhood in Boston.The study aimed to gauge the stress impact of exposure to violence by testing the levels of cortisol—a hormone that is secreted at higher levels in high-stress situations—in each of the subjects.Suglia and his team took saliva samples in order to compare cortisol levels to parents’ descriptions of their children’s stress levels. They then analyzed differences in sleeping patterns, exposure to varying severities of violence, and degrees of worrying.The study concluded that there was a correlation between alterations in the body’s stress pathways, cortisol levels and exposure to violence. The symptoms attributed to an increased exposure to violence are similar to those experienced by patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, though Suglia said the children in the study were not clinically diagnosed with PTSD.“As a physician this kind of information is humbling because so much of what affects people’s health is outside of a doctor’s office,” said Thomas Lee, a professor in the department of health policy and management, who added that it is important to take into consideration exposure to violence when diagnosing patients.“I am quite confident that exposure to violence increases depression,” he said.     Suglia cautioned that with all studies, confounding variables and sampling design can be a concern. The study tried to explicitly show that differences in exposure to violence were directly responsible for negative health-effects related to stress levels, but Suglia, said that “there is always the chance of some other type of violence exposure, some other form of stress that we were not capturing.”Suglia said the study was conducted in a “homogeneous” neighborhood, in order to mitigate the risk of underlying differences in the subjects.

Last night, Howard A. Zucker, an Institute of Politics visiting fellow and the former assistant director-general of the World Health Organization, led an interactive question and answer session on modern health policy.“I don’t want this to have a lecture format,” Zucker said with a smile at the beginning of the session, who added that he preferred to encourage question-driven talk in order to address student perspectives and queries. Discussion ranged from global and national health policy issues to Zucker’s personal perspective in these fields and  the journey that brought him to his current position. He also referred briefly to possible long-term effects of the current swine flu outbreak on health policy, as many of the WHO’s resources are being aimed at that problem.“All this energy gets directed towards a crisis like this,” he says, “But then after that the energy can be dissipated in other areas.”Zucker discussed his conviction that progress in the field of health care is better achieved by the advancement of technology than by institutional change of health systems in different countries. He spoke about incorporating technology into health care systems in developing nations, stressing the importance of starting by introducing basic technologies—like cell phones—before moving on to more complex equipment, like MRI scanners. “Teach people, then teach them a little bit more,” he said. Zucker engaged his audience with his energy and stories from his personal experience, one of which involved saving the life of a 14-year-old on the way home after a long day at work by recognizing a cardiac symptom that others had missed. “Bottom line is, that kid’s alive today,” he says. “That’s what it’s all about.”Zucker spoke to students as part of Harvard Health Policy Review’s speaker series, in which prominent members in modern Health Policy speak to students about their pursuits and perspectives. The event was co-sponsored by the Harvard College Law Society. Students said they enjoyed the session and were pleased to get the chance to have such an intimate conversation with Zucker.“He’s just incredible. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard of someone who has an M.D and J.D,” said Bennett A. Caughey ’10, “He’s done so many things. It’s ridiculous.” After graduating from medical school at the age of 22, Zucker went on to earn a law degree, realizing that he would be able to save more lives on a policy scale than from inside a hospital.“You need a balance,” he said, emphasizing the need to seek intellectual stimulation in one’s career. “You need to keep some sense of excitement.”

A small group of students gathered at the Harvard Hillel last night to discuss and sample Israeli Cuisine and learn about its evolution throughout the nation’s history.The talk, led by Naor Ben-Yehoyada, a teaching fellow for Social Analysis 70: “Food and Culture,” gave students a crash course in Israeli food and culinary traditions.The history of Jewish and Israeli food is largely intertwined with Israel’s turbulent history, but according to Ben-Yehoyada, “what we eat doesn’t travel along the same lines as our politics.”The region’s culinary identity began to take shape in the decades following Israel’s formation—in 1948, the United Kingdom terminated the British Mandate of Palestine, which had placed the region under British rule, and Israel became an autonomous entity.Before this, the region’s cuisine was largely determined by foreign influences.“In the 1920s and ’30s, the food consisted of what was palatable to Jews coming from Europe,” Ben-Yehoyada said.Among the foods served at the talk were chips, a British side-dish that was originally popular in the coastal regions of Palestine but has since spread to much of Israel.In its early years, Israel’s infant economy dictated the types of food consumed by its inhabitants.Ben-Yehoyada said that many foods that are considered staples come from this period, when Israel could not fund its own factories and needed monetary support from overseas businessmen.“It was a recession state, a highly regulated production economy,” he said adding that Israel was largely unable to import goods so local products were primarily utilized in food production.Couscous, another dish served at the dinner, and pita bread, a popular item in Israel, are both made of wheat, a crop that is abundant in the region.“You were told what to grow,” Ben-Yehoyada said, noting that during this period, any food produced in surplus was used in cooking, occasionally to extremes.“If during a season you made too much lettuce, everybody ate lettuce,” he said.Many of Israel’s unique fruit juices were originally created during an orange surplus.According to Ben-Yehoyada, the 1990s saw the advent of popular Israeli and Jewish ethnic food.But many items associated with Israel in fact originated all over Europe and the Middle East.Schnitzel, from Germany, is often stuffed into pita, Falafel is Egyptian, Israeli salad is actually Turkish, and fried eggplant is Iraqi.“[Ben-Yehoyada] was incredible,” said Sarah B. Honig ’10, a member of the Harvard Culinary Society, which co-sponsored the event with the Harvard Students for Israel. “I thought it was a huge success.”

Yesterday afternoon, the Phillips Brooks House Association rallied alongside community organizers and other advocacy groups at the Massachusetts State House in response to the state’s budget proposal, which may result in cutbacks to funding for the association’s youth programs.
The new budget plan, issued by the Boston House Ways and Means Committee, calls for reductions in funding for many state government programs, including support for the University of Massachusetts, mental health services, and youth funding—the last of which has several implications for PBHA’s programs.
At the rally, Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone of Somerville captured the sentiment of the crowd of approximately 300 when he expressed his displeasure with the measures. 
“You cannot cut your way out of this economic problem, you cannot layoff your way out of this problem. We need leadership and will make the sacrifices on the municipal level,” he said.
According to Maria Dominguez Gray, Deputy Director of PBHA, cuts to the Boston Youth Fund (BYF) will have a large impact on the association’s employment of high school students in the Summer Urban Program (SUP).  The program consists of 12 student-run camps that provide classroom experience and field trips to Boston and Cambridge Youth.
SUP usually hires 90-100 high school students to serve as junior counselors in its camps. BYF funds about $56,000 in salary for these counselors, according to Gray, and losing that funding would possibly force the program to drop roughly half of its junior counselor staff.
Under the proposed budget plan, the reduction in counselors could also result in an up to 50 percent reduction in the total size of the SUP program. 
Aside from the BYF, which would be cut from $9 million to zero under the new budget proposal, other youth-oriented programs may be trimmed as well. The Department of Public Health Youth Violence Prevention Program would be reduced from $3.5 million dollars to zero, and the Shannon Anti-gang Violence Program would be cut from $13 million to zero. Collectively, the cutbacks to youth programs would total about $25.5 million.
These cuts will have a direct impact on PBHA’s funding. The association is slated to lose a $4000 grant from the Department of Public Health Youth Violence Prevention Program. It would also receive a reduced grant from the After-School and Out-of-School programs. The grant’s value would fall from $52,000 to $42,000.
Many of the grants not only fund the SUP program, but also term-time jobs worked by Boston youths at the camps.
Dominguez said that PBHA worries also about the potential rise in youth violence, that may be brought on by these job cuts.
“By cutting the funds, we’re really not saving money in the long run,” she said. “We end up having to pay more in taxes for prisons and the crimes affecting our communities—way more,” she said.

A Harvard Law School professor declared yesterday that she will not accept a prestigious award for American Catholics from the University of Notre Dame, citing concerns over the university’s decision to grant commencement speaker President Barack Obama an honorary degree.
In her decision to turn down the Laetare Medal, Mary Ann Glendon raised objections to the university’s willingness to honor someone whose “fundamental moral principles” differ from those of the Catholic Church.
Obama has in the past taken a pro-choice position on the issue of abortion, and Glendon, a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican and a prominent Catholic intellectual, is known for her staunch pro-life stance in accordance with Church doctrine. 
According to a letter Glendon wrote to Notre Dame University President John I. Jenkins, the university had issued “talking points” suggesting that her presence at the commencement would “balance” Obama’s pro-choice views.
“It is not the right place...for engagement with the very serious problems raised by Notre Dame’s decision...to honor a prominent and uncompromising opponent of the Church’s position on issues involving fundamental principles of justice,” Glendon wrote.
In recent weeks, controversy has swelled over Obama’s invitation to speak at Notre Dame, but school officials have downplayed the criticism the university has recently faced from the Catholic community.
“Any time there’s a politician, there are going to be positions that are contrary to church teaching,” said Notre Dame spokesman Dennis K. Brown, who noted that former president George W. Bush’s support of the death penalty also engendered criticism before his 2001 appearance at the school.
In a statement, Jenkins said that the university was “disappointed” by Glendon’s decision and planned to name another recipient in the near future.
The Laetare Medal, which recognizes a Catholic whose “genius has ennobled the arts and sciences,” has been awarded annually since 1883. Notable recipients include former President John F. Kennedy ’40 and former U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
Tona M. Boyd, a third-year Harvard Law School student, said she was disconcerted by the backlash from the Catholic community against Obama’s invitation to speak at Notre Dame, even while acknowledging Glendon’s predicament.
But Boyd, a co-president of the Harvard Catholic Law Student Association, also criticized the “politicizing” of religious questions related to the sanctity of human life.
“I would like to see more consistency across the board in terms of advocating against the death penalty, for living wages, and other issues that are clearly on the Church’s agenda,” Boyd said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Boston city planners presented Allston residents and University developers with a long-term conceptual framework for neighborhood development at last night’s North Allston-Brighton Community-Wide Planning meeting where they discussed issues ranging from public transportation to open spaces and street-side commercial development.
The CWP process, which addresses development issues in Allston not limited to Harvard’s expansion, has been conducted internally since late fall as city officials focused on the University’s future institutional plans and decision to slow construction in Allston due to financial constraints.
Officials from the Boston Redevelopment Authority—the city’s powerful planning and development agency—said at the meeting that the CWP process is entering a new planning and implementation phase, after having been dominated by theoretical brainstorming and discussion last year.
Kairos Shen, the BRA’s chief planner, said that last night’s meeting was aimed at providing a broad framework for the upcoming CWP process. 
“[The process] is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together,” Shen said. “This [meeting] is the box of the jigsaw puzzle—we want to make sure the puzzle is going in the right direction.”
The next meeting, to take place next month, will focus on specific plans for improving the Holton Street Corridor, which stretches from the Brighton Mills shopping center on Western Ave. to the Mass. Turnpike, Shen said.
Armed with a lengthy PowerPoint presentation and an array of colorful maps of Allston, BRA Chief Architect Bob Kroin laid out a series of plans to address what he said were the three main goals distilled from previous CWP discussions: increasing the Charles River’s accessibility to Allston, connecting currently disparate neighborhoods with green pathways and street networks, and aggregating commercial and cultural activity along Western Ave. at several focal points. 
Tad Read, a senior planner for the BRA, followed Kroin’s presentation by describing possible improvements to public transportation in Allston. These included the construction of an MBTA commuter rail station at the southern edge of the neighborhood as well as the development of a circular rapid bus transit system around Boston that would improve Allston’s already-extensive bus network.
Kroin emphasized that none of the ideas presented at the meeting were set in stone and that the BRA hoped the plans would inspire further community discussion and input. Following the presentations, meeting attendees split into three breakout discussion groups to discuss their ideas and concerns more closely with BRA officials. 
Harry Mattison, a local resident and a Harvard Allston Task Force member, said after the meeting that while the presentation was intended to be a broad overview, he would rather the BRA focus more on specific development issues such as the Charlesview apartment relocation and not plans that “may or may not happen in 10 or 20 years.”
But Sal Pinchera, another Allston resident, said that Mattison’s view is short-sighted, and that the current CWP framework is helpful in bringing together diverse neighborhood viewpoints.
“I like to think about 10 or 20 years out, even if I might not be here. We need to think about the people that come after us and look at the long-term,” Pinchera said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Rummaging through the closet of her Canaday single, Tal Oppenheimer ’12 searches for a dress. The intense midday sun is banned from her room by heavy curtains as she ruffles through her clothing in search of her favorite gown. Finally, she holds her treasure up with pride—a miniscule turquoise number, bedazzled and glistening despite the shade. It is one of the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team’s standard competition gowns.
Minutes later, with nearly as much enthusiasm as she displayed over the stunning dress, she declares: “Let me show you my prosthetics.” 
EVOLUTION OF DANCE
Oppenheimer has been dancing for eleven years despite being born with a congenital amputation caused by an amniotic band that left her right arm truncated slightly below the elbow.
“It’s not a big part of who I am,” she says. “I have one arm, but my friends forget about it. It’ll be like, ‘Oh, does my finger look swollen?’ And they’ll grab my other hand to compare and I’ll laugh at them.”
From the age of six Oppenheimer says she began lobbying her mother for the chance to take dance classes.
“One day I came home and said, ‘I want to tap,’ and my mom said, ‘Okay. Let’s find you a class.’” 
The six-year-old was soon enrolled in a small studio, and embarked on what would become a life-long love affair with dance.
“Her first teacher was elderly,” said Oppenheimer’s mother, Tamar, in a phone interview, “and I think [Tal] was afraid of her. But that was her first tap teacher, and she was amazing.”
The decline of her first studio led Oppenheimer to begin dancing at The Beat, a dance company in her hometown of Berkley, California. There, she was exposed to rhythm tap, a style that incorporates jazz rhythms developed on the city streets and that is vastly different from the more common Broadway tap.
In high school, Oppenheimer received private lessons from tap master Sam Weber, who the New York Times writes is “the equivalent of a virtuoso pianist.” 
“He’s amazing. He moves his foot and it makes seven different sounds!” she laughs, beaming as she describes her tutor.
Weber, a former ballet dancer and a professional tapper since 1986, remarked in an interview that Oppenheimer was a “great student.”
“She would find an exercise frustrating or nearly impossible in one lesson and then come back the next week having little or no trouble with it,” he said.
Oppenheimer also danced at the Bay Area Rhythm Tap Company, where she was thrust into the role of instructor.
“A teacher was having some knee problems and had to go through a recovery period,” Oppenheimer says. “[The teacher] had Sam [Weber], and he would teach her classes, and I would go to every class he was teaching, regardless of the level. When he left, I would sub.”
When Oppenheimer taught, she was typically the youngest person in the room. “They were all adult classes, but I knew all of them and I was friends with them,” she recalls. She fondly refers to the dancers as her “adoptive parents.”
In fact, in Oppenheimer’s dorm room, a plushy stuffed monkey sits at the foot of her bed, a gift from one of her “dance mothers.”
Oppenheimer also performed in the 2007 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
“I was a tap dancing Christmas tree. I danced the entire route. I wasn’t even on a float, so I had to travel,” she says.
“She’s a hard worker,” her mother commented. “When she’s not tapping with her feet, she’s tapping with her fingers!”
But upon her arrival at Harvard, Oppenheimer decided to try her hand at a vastly different form of dance.
INSIDE THE PRACTICE STUDIO
“My brother started doing ballroom at his school,” Oppenheimer says, speaking of her foray into ballroom dance.
“It made me think, ‘Oh, I can do something new in college!’ So that’s why I started thinking of ballroom,” she says. “That, and So You Think You Can Dance,” she added referring to the popular reality television show.
Oppenheimer joined the Harvard Ballroom Dance Team, and has since danced and placed in five competitions.
At practice, Oppenheimer’s dedication to dance shines brighter than her rhinestone-studded ballroom gown.
At first she stands with her team, which she describes as “one big happy family.” Then the music starts and it’s all business, she says. 
With an upcoming competition at MIT looming, the dancers are aiming to hone their movements into a solid, graceful routine, worthy of the top prize. 
A sensual Latin number comes first, and Oppenheimer takes her position, intense focus evident on her face. She joins her partner and sways to the beat.
In the austere, dim practice room, with dancers clad in basic t-shirts and tight black exercise pants, the lighthearted social gathering transforms into a passionate cat-and-mouse game between the dancers. 
If Oppenheimer were not sporting a tank-top, it would be impossible to tell that she was wearing a prosthetic arm. 
Her partner throws her over his knee, as other couples twist and spin around the room.
The song ends, and it’s all smiles once again as the team critiques each other’s steps. It’s a careful, exact process, an optimal blend of serious assessment and light-hearted banter. And once everything has been said, another song begins.
In the midst of the controlled chaos of practice, with couples looping in and out of each other’s paths, Oppenheimer taps her silver ballroom shoes across the floor in the brief moments of rest. Her feet move like lightning and it produces a crisp clatter that can be heard over the din of the practice room. 
A CHORUS OF SOUND
When she is not in a dance studio, Oppenheimer can be found in a woodturning studio.
She will live in Mather House next year which houses its own woodshop. Oppenheimer says she is grateful that it saves her from midnight commutes from the Yard to the shop.
“I built my dining room table,” she says proudly. “You walk into my house, and you see my table. Then there’s a mirror with the mosaic I made around it, and then you see my salad bowls and cutting boards.”
In her room, she is eager to show off the numerous wooden bowls that she has crafted over the course of the semester.
As for the future, Oppenheimer says she is unsure of what lies ahead. She knows she wants to be a “science-something” concentrator, and that she intends to continue dancing throughout her life.
She still takes lessons from Weber when she returns home. “We’re doing some very advanced dances now, and it’s a lot of fun for me to dance with her— challenging, too!” Weber noted.
“Between the beats that other people do, he puts a few more,” Oppenheimer’s mother said of her daughter’s teacher.
However, Oppenheimer is hesitant to pursue dance professionally.
“As much as I love dance, I don’t think I’d want to make a career out of it. I love it, though, and I intend to do it my entire life,” she says.
It is easy to believe that she will never stop dancing as one watches her glide easily across the floor, her tapping feet emanating a chorus of sound.

We get it. Shit happens. Celebrities flake. You end up at the wrong Ivy. Or stuck on Long Island. Understandable.
But with Brangelina and Fabolous both ditching high-profile Cambridge appearances in less than a month's time, FlyBy's starting to get pissed. Do celebrities have something against Harvard? Is the Kremlin on the Charles not liberal enough for Hollywood? We don't get it.
But hey, now that we think about it, this whole celeb no-show thing might not be so bad after all. It really does make event planning much easier. In fact, we have our own announcement to make.
PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL GUEST POST ON FLYBY TOMORROW
OMG. YES. 2 P.M. WHEREVER YOUR COMPUTER IS.

It's 92 degrees. Your thighs are sticking together as you wait out your 90-minute un-air-conditioned lecture. Beads of sweat are oozing out of pores you didn't know existed.
But keep that perspiring chin up. The EPA just bumped the Charles River's D grade to a B+. Not bad, if you are willing to risk the remaining microbes and stormwater pollution still muddying the (in)famous waters.

We know...it's already two emails within a week--before classes are even over, mind you.  But you must learn to love Barry...besides, he really added a special touch to this second installment.
Notice his shout out to the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, conspicuously absent from his first email.  FlyBy wonders if this caused any unrest within the Registrar this past week.  He also really went for conciseness here, cutting out "Friday" when referencing "May 29th" (a whole week after finals are over!  First agenda for the summer, eh?), and saying "I encourage you to complete all of your evaluations this term" instead of "I encourage you to complete evaluations for all of your courses this term"--saving you one word of reading!
But there were some odd parts of Barry's plea.  His promises to give us more on the 'new functionality' re: receiving our grades were left unfulfilled--FlyBy will stay on the lookout.  Also, we're highly skeptical of his primary piece of advice:
How about not?  Otherwise you can't fully factor in that random ass Core class that decides its finally time to play hardball on the final.  Let's try to keep these stats as useful as possible.
Has FlyBy's useless banter not assuaged you?  Are you still mildly irritated at this fascinating intersection of email spam, administration coercion, sex, and grade-infused stress?  We're sorry, barring a SLAM-encouraged boycott of the Q, there's not much you can do--unfortunately, emails are free.

That's what The New York Times' newest columnist penned in his first column for the Grey Lady.  Ross Gregory Douthat, a former columnist for The Crimson, argues that it would have been best for the Republican Party to have Cheney run for President because it would have proven how hopeless the Republican Party is? See how Douthat describes Cheney's conservativism after the jump.
"...precisely the sort of conservatism that’s ascendant in today’s much-reduced Republican Party, from the talk radio dials to the party’s grassroots. And a Cheney-for-President campaign would have been an instructive test of its political viability."
That is a euphemistic way to say that a campaign by Cheney for President would have put it right out in the open that the "much-reduced" Republican Party was screwed in a diversified America.
Although bloggers originally lauded Douthat's choice as a thoughtful one for the conservative columnist spot, many comments on this column were scathing.  One commenter calls him an "irritating 30 year old Generation Y Harvard Grad who is not demonstrating much thought in his first column."  Another claims that he "has taken leave of his senses."  But many also lauded him for writing a column that acknowledges both sides and does seem to have required some thinking.  It appears NYT readers don't have very high standards for conservative writers after all.  How else could FlyBy have grown up watching David Brooks on The News Hour with Jim Lehrer every night?  That vacillating man.
Douthat's first column may have been decent--considering that he is replacing Kristol--but it was not mind-blowing.  FlyBy is still awaiting that column on Gen Ed and the state of undergraduate education at Harvard.  Also, why does he highlight his New Haven roots in his bio?  Not cool, Mr. Douthat.
