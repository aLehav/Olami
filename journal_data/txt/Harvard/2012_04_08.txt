After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One of the numerous virtues of the Boston Symphony Orchestra is that patrons can expect a great performance every single time they attend with little risk of disappointment. Very few orchestras in the world can be trusted with a masterpiece like Johannes Brahms’s “Ein deutsches Requiem,” which demands a large but technically precise choir and a disciplined orchestra to support it. But Thursday night, the BSO joined forces with the Tanglewood Festival Chorus to perform the piece, and under the skillful leadership of guest conductor Christoph von Dohnányi, more than 200 musicians on stage that night made their way triumphantly through the redemptive beatitudes and confrontations with death in the great German requiem. They will give their final performance of the piece tonight in Boston’s Symphony Hall.
The requiem has a richly emotional history reflected in the piece’s depths and details. When Brahms started writing the piece, his mother had passed away, and his mentor Robert Schumann had just attempted suicide. Brahms was still afflicted by his feelings of inadequacy next to Beethoven, whom he revered. Before Brahms, Mozart and Berlioz had also written requiems for the dead—both of which had become career-defining works. The forms are very structured, and though somber in tone due to their liturgical roots, the pieces always end on a celebratory note that signifies looking forward to the glory of the afterlife.
Brahms’s work calls for two soloists, a soprano and a baritone. Anna Prohaska made her BSO debut in the soprano role, and in a majestic entrance, she glided on stage as if riding a cloud. Expectations ran impossibly high, yet she ably performed her solo in the fifth movement. Her voice had considerable strength, and her delicate last notes in pianissimo—delivering the lyrics “Ich will euch wieder sehen,” which translate to “I will see you again”—proved that she was an elegant complement to the vigor of the BSO. German bass-baritone Hanno Müller-Brachmann’s polished performance was characterized by fluid and emotional expression of the text. His solo in the third movement was technically impeccable, though his performance would have been stronger if he had dug a little deeper into the lower notes.
Prohaska and Müller-Brachmann were both impressive, but no amount of charisma could have overshadowed the achievement of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus that night. The chorus was a vision of unity and control, and despite its size, it maintained a dynamic balance across its register and delicately handled the requiem’s soft passages. Director John Oliver has amassed an incredibly talented group, particularly the men of the choir—the entrance of the lower register in the second movement was executed with power and emotion. The fugal choral passage in the sixth was a testament to the choir’s technical precision.
The intricate backdrop to all this was the accomplished performance of the BSO. Though in the past the ensemble has struggled with its bursting energy in accommodating soloists, the BSO performed the German requiem with incredible discipline. The final instrumental chord of the second movement was outstanding—one might even say perfect—in its distribution of dynamics over the range of the orchestra. Through the 75-minute concert, the austere von Dohnányi held refined control over all the musicians, who responded instinctually to his gestures as he guided them between deliberate gravitas and brooding emotion.
At the end of the sixth movement, the full choir sang, backed by aggressive strings, “Tod, wo ist dein Stachel? Hölle, wo ist dein Sieg?” (“O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”) If there is such a thing as an aesthetic absolute, this moment brought the Boston Symphony Orchestra ever closer to it. At the very least, Brahms’s feelings of grief, fragility, and strength live on in Symphony Hall.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Scholars, artists, and community activists convened this weekend at the fourth annual Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program Conference to discuss the experience of African American Muslims and approaches to uniting indigenous and immigrant Muslim communities.
“We don’t have a set agenda. We’re just trying to foster a dialogue,” said professor Ali S. Asani ’77, the director of the Islamic Studies Program and one of the organizers of the conference. “This is such an important part of the history of the U.S. and the history of Islam.”
The two-day conference showcased perspectives of scholars and artists, including a panel about the role of art in the African American Muslim community and a screening of the film “The Wayward Son,” about a professional skateboarder who embraces Islam.
“We deliberately made it about more than academics,” said Krystina R. Friedlander, a program assistant at the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Islamic Studies Program. “[We] tried to be as inclusive as possible.”
Among the artists invited to speak at the conference was Amir Sulaiman, a Muslim spoken word poet who said the conference provided a “safe place” for discussions within the Muslim community.
The conference attracted undergraduate and graduate students, members of the local Muslim community, and members of the public for interactive discussions about the divisions between indigenous and immigrant Muslims and the challenges involved in organizing the Muslim community.
Khalil Abdur-Rashid, an Imam and a religious life adviser to students at Columbia University, spoke on the evolving nature of Muslim leadership.
“We are now seeing the emergence of a new form of leadership called Muslim chaplaincy,” Abdur-Rashid said, noting a transition from the traditional, “monolithic” community leader to more integrated power structures that are better able to bridge the gender divide and address the concerns of many voices.
Katherine R. Merriman, a graduate of the Harvard Divinity School, traveled from New York to attend the conference.
“[The conference] is a concentration of this really important and embarrassingly neglected field,” she said. “Professor Asani is really incredible because he takes into account non-academic perspectives.”
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Malika Zeghal echoed these sentiments.
“It’s almost dizzying because so much has been said in a day and a half,” she said.

Professor Maria Tatar, the chair of the Committee on Degrees in Folklore and Mythology, noted the historical evolution of fairy tales—from legends adults told around the hearth, to bedtime stories for children, and finally to multimedia projects aimed at people of all ages—in a lecture Thursday at the Dudley branch of the Boston Public Library in Roxbury.
Tatar’s address is part of the John Harvard Book Celebration, a series of events at 34 Boston and Cambridge libraries to celebrate the University’s 375th anniversary.
In her lecture, Tatar contextualized the contemporary development of stories that have survived across the ages.
“Fairy tales migrate into book and go from a multi-generational audience to children over time,” she said, “These are stories that have moved across the generations.”
She described the prominence of fairy tales in media today, comparing “The Hunger Games” to “Hansel and Gretel” and naming various recent and upcoming films such as “Snow White and the Huntsman,” “Tangled,” and “Beastly.”
“The studio becomes our main portal for fairy tales,” she said. “We use these stories to work out cultural anxieties.”
Tatar said that fairy tales remain relevant today because of our need to express societal concerns, such as innocence and sexuality in women.
“They take up matters that are primal and pertinent,” she said. “There’s an odd way that good stories will teach lessons in subtle ways.”
She also observed how today’s new media explicitly reference the origins of fairy tales. Tatar noted that the name of the e-book reader “Kindle” suggests the hearth or fireplace where fairy tales had their beginnings in oral tradition.
In responding to one audience member’s question on whether modern-day spins are unfair to these classic fairy tales, Tatar said that these revisions should in fact be seen as positive developments.
“They are tales that should be refashioned,” she said. “They complicate the stories, the history of fairy tales, in a wonderful way.”
“You’ve got magic in all their kaleidoscopic variations,” she added.
The lecture drew about 25 audience members, mainly from around the Boston area.
“I love stories. I think that they’re a really great way to share a culture,” said Sophia Kuo, a clinical fellow in psychiatry at Harvard who attended the event.

After five years, thirty-three thousand hours of manpower, and several million dollars, Memorial Church debuted its new pipe organ during an hour-long prelude before Easter service this Sunday.
Assistant University Organist and Choirmaster and musician Christian M. Lane inaugurated the new organ, which was dedicated to the late Reverend Peter J. Gomes and Charles B. Fisk ’49, a Harvard physicist who in his later years channeled his scientific genius into the construction of organs.
Over the last several years, organ builders painstakingly installed the new instrument on the balcony at the back of the Church, exposing the large Palladian window at the front of the chapel.
The majestic organ’s gold pipes and dark wood panels now tower over the church’s central nave.
Before the change, the old organ stood at the front of the chapel. The volume of the music was too loud for intimate services like morning prayers, and yet too soft to reach audiences in the main part of the church during large gatherings.
The new organ will supplement a smaller, existing organ disguised by elaborate panels against the walls of the small chapel at the front of the church.
According to Lane, the two organs will now allow musicians to preform for intimate audiences in the chapel using the small organ, and for larger audiences seated in the nave using the larger one.
Memorial Church’s old organ has been given to a church in Texas.
The process of planning and building the new organ took at least five years, Lane said.
Lane noted that organ construction has not changed significantly since the Renaissance, when organs—along with clocks—were among the most complex machines built by man.
But despite the immense effort and expense, Lane said that musicians should resist the temptation to opt for cheaper, digital organs in the future.
The movement of air and breathing of an original pipe organ is “irreplaceable,” he said.
He tested out the new organ’s capabilities as congregants sat spellbound for an hour before the service, listening as cascading music filled church.
The church had commissioned a piece, entitled “Spring Bursts Today,” to be played for the first time on the occasion.
Over the next few weeks, Memorial Church will host a series of concerts from famous organists to showcase the new Fisk organ.

University President Drew G. Faust has been nominated to serve on the Board of Directors of office supply store chain Staples, the company announced this week. Shareholders will vote on Faust’s nomination at the company’s annual meeting on June 4.
“We’re very pleased to nominate Dr. Faust to our Board of Directors,” said Staples Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ronald L. Sargent ’77 in a statement. “She will bring a unique perspective to our Board in leading a complex, global organization. Dr. Faust has extensive leadership and management experience related to capital planning, financial oversight, risk management, technology and strategy.”
Faust responded positively to the nomination and expressed confidence in her ability to take up another role.
“After five years as president I feel comfortable making a commitment to serving on another board where I can gain additional insight that might be beneficial to my role at Harvard,” she said in a statement.
In the past, university presidents have been criticized for serving on the boards of large corporations while president.
“That’s just a no-no,” Harvard Business School Professor Jay W. Lorsch told the Chronicle of Higher Education earlier this year. “You want to be as pure as Caesar’s wife. You don’t want to create, as a university president, any appearance of impropriety.”
The 12 directors received approximately $300,000 in compensation each in 2010, according to a report in the Boston Herald.
Faust’s recent nomination is not Harvard’s only connection to Staples, which is based 25 miles from Harvard Square in Framingham, Mass.
Founder and former CEO Thomas G. Stemberg ’71 served on the Board of Overseers’ Visiting Committee to the Business School, and is currently the honorary chairman of the Friends of Harvard Basketball.
In 2000, Stemberg dedicated the Harvard Square location of Staples in honor of several Harvard administrators who were responsible for his acceptance to the College.

Actress Diane Farr identified culture—not race—as the greater cause of friction in interracial relationships, at a conference Saturday for local universities organized by Harvard Half Asian People’s Association.
Farr headlined the Harvard HAPA ‘So...What Are You, Anyway?’ (SWAYA) conference, the fourth annual event organized by the student cultural group to examine and discuss HAPA culture. During her address, Farr discussed the difficulty of managing different cultural backgrounds as she entered her marriage with a Korean-American nearly six years ago.
“One of the hardest things for me to learn, after getting married to a Korean-American, was not to kiss his parents,” Farr said, with a laugh. “It was just reflexive for me to greet them in a certain way, and it took me a while to get used to recognizing the difference in customs.”
In fact, kissing provided Farr with creative material for the title of her recently published book, “Kissing Outside the Lines.” Her book focuses on the experience of being married to a Korean-American man and being a mother to three half-Asian, half-Caucasian children.
In gathering material for her book, Farr said that she talked to many mixed-race and single-race families. She noted that she discovered some surprising trends in the single-race families.
“As I was trying to dissect these conversations and interviews, it was shocking to see educated, liberal, worldly people harbor...prejudice in their homes,” Farr said. “Somebody in your family had to climb a mountain or cross an ocean for you to exist the way you do today. You owe it to them and to each other as a small and powerful group of Americans to own all aspects of yourself and utilize it to move that voice forward.”
Farr, an actress who has appeared on TV shows such as Numb3rs, Rescue Me, and Californication, was just one of the many speakers that spoke at this year’s SWAYA conference. In the four years since its inception, the SWAYA conference has grown tremendously in size, according to former Harvard HAPA President James Fish ’10.
“It’s personal for all of us that are involved,” said Fish, who organized the first SWAYA conference. “It’s important for us to have a space that talks about race and identity outside of traditional paradigms of constructions of race.”
SWAYA has increased in attendance year after year, garnering interest from mixed-race student groups from across the country. Jamison Leid, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania, was one of the visiting students.
“We were interested in seeing how other people did things,” Leid said.

If you were lucky enough to be up early this morning you may have spotted some of the near 880 eggs that UC representative Salena Cui '15 and friends secretly placed around the Yard. The UC provided all of the plastic eggs as well as the sweet treats packed inside of them. Cui and company placed the eggs all over the place—going so far as to put some right at John Harvard's feet. If you're just waking up, Flyby recommends you get out there and snatch some of those special eggs for yourself—that is before the tourists get them! In this department the Union dorms and Apley might just have the advantage.

If you're mulling over not being able to eat carbs because of Passover, fear not! These Harvard Square finds will fuel your eight-day holiday with such deliciousness that you will forget that Moses and the rest of the crew didn't have enough time to leaven that bread.
To refresh your memory, if you're keeping kosher for Passover, you're supposed to avoid foods, except matzo, made with wheat, barley, rye, spelt, or oats.
Depending on whether you're Ashkenazi or Sephardic, you may have different rules, so ask your Rabbi or Hillel if you have any concerns.
Meanwhile, these foods should keep you pretty full for the next week.
Start Your Day Off Right:
In general, most breakfast foods will be on the safe side, so get a little crazy and try Zoe's sweet potato pancakes, topped with homemade cinnamon butter and maple syrup ($6.99).
Afternoon Snack:
Stop by local favorite Berryline and get some frozen yogurt. This week's flavors are original, Nutella and lychee. Most toppings are safe, but avoid the rice-based mochi.
Drop in to Tealuxe for some bubble tea. If you're craving extra energy, try their blended Green Tea Matcha with bubbles—they're made out of tapioca ($4.98 for a regular with bubbles).
Feeling Fancy (With a Full Wallet):
Going out on a date but don't want to put a damper on the evening without those carbohydrates? Harvest has a three-course tasting menu, from which you can order a-la-carte, which is completely kosher for Passover. Go indulge ($44 per person).
Get Your Greens:
All of Veggie Planet's menu can be ordered over a salad or coconut rice. Get the well-known favorite, Henry's Dinner—roasted butternut squash, carmelized onion, herbs, and decadent goat cheese—it won't disappoint!
Can't Help Your Sweet Tooth:
Finale has a kosher for Passover menu, which is just as good as the regular one: Dark Chocolate Decadence, Raspberry Cream Cake, and the Matzo Crunch which is their take on brittle—chocolate covered matzo drizzled with gooey caramel and all of that goodness. Order them while you can! (Cakes are $12 for the small, Matzo Crunch is $6.49 for half a pound).
As a final note, the foods listed above are not acceptable for those who are strictly keeping kosher for Passover. If you have any concerns about the food items listed above make sure to ask whether the items are certified kosher for Passover, and, of couse, Hillel is open for all three meals this week to satisfy your food desires!
