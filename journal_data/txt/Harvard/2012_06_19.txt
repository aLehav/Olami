After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senator Scott Brown warily agreed on Monday to a debate co-sponsored by the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the U.S. Senate, saying that he will only participate if he is confident that the event will be politically neutral.
In a letter to the EMK Institute, Brown asked that Victoria R. Kennedy, the wife of the late Senator Edward M. Kennedy ’54-’56 and the chairwoman EMK Institute, remain neutral and uninvolved in his current Senate race against Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren.
“In order to proceed, we need to know that in keeping with the spirit of neutrality expressed in Vicki Kennedy’s letter that she will not endorse or otherwise get involved in this race,” Brown’s campaign manager Jim Barnett wrote in a letter to the EMK Institute.
The Republican campaign’s response comes a week after Kennedy sent letters to both campaigns inviting the candidates to a debate on September 26 co-sponsored by the EMK Institute and the University of Massachusetts Boston. Kennedy proposed that longtime NBC newsman Tom Brokaw would moderate a nationally televised debate on MSNBC.
Brown requested that MSNBC be replaced in favor of a local station.
“While we accept Tom Brokaw as a moderator, we prefer debates with local media sponsors, not out-of-state cable networks with a reputation for political advocacy,” Barnett wrote.
Though there has been some discussion surrounding the date of the debate, which is currently scheduled to be held on the Jewish High Holy Day of Yom Kippur, Warren accepted the invitation last Monday without conditions. She urged Brown to do the same in honor of the memory of the late Kennedy, who held the Senate seat for more than 40 years.
Brown’s campaign said at the time that the debate, like other invitations, was still under consideration. As Barnett expressed in his letter Monday, Brown was hesitant to accept a debate sponsored in part by a member of the powerful Massachusetts Democratic family, many of whose members have already endorsed Warren.
The candidates have had other difficulties agreeing about when and where they will debate since Warren became the official Democratic nominee earlier this month.
Both candidates have agreed to two yet-to-be-scheduled televised debates, one hosted by WBZ-TV of Boston and one by a consortium of out-of-state media outlets. Warren has committed to an additional televised debate and Brown to two radio debates.
In a press release Monday afternoon, the Massachusetts Democratic Party criticized Brown for his attempts to change the terms of the debate.
“Scott Brown is tying himself in knots over debates,” Massachusetts Democratic Party Chair John Walsh wrote in the release. “The junior senator just needs to sit down with the Warren folks and have an honest conversation. It's not that hard.”
Neither Warren's campaign nor the EMK Institute could be reached for comment.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Barack Obama’s executive decision Friday to limit the deportation of undocumented immigrants has been met with a mixture of joy and scrutiny from the Harvard community.
Under the provisions of the order, immigrants who came to the United States before age 16, have lived in the United States for at least five years, and are currently attending school, have graduated high school, or have served in the military will no longer be deported, unless they are also over the age of thirty or have criminal records. The order will affect about 800,000 people.
“This announcement is life changing for the students at Harvard and elsewhere who came to the United States as young children and have studied and worked in the years since with the goal of contributing to their communities and to our national life,” University President Drew G. Faust wrote in an email.
Many observers noted the executive order’s similarity to the DREAM Act, a failed bill that would have provided undocumented youth with a six-year-long path to citizenship after completing two years of coursework for a higher education degree or two years of military service. Faust was a strong backer of the Act.
“Like most other advocates of the DREAM Act, I was super happy to hear that the executive order had finally been announced,” said Nicolas E. Jofre ’13, former co-director of Harvard College Act on a Dream, a student group devoted to immigrant issues. “It’s a relief that’s been needed for a very long time.”
Undocumented Harvard students expressed enthusiasm for the new policy.
“I think it’s such a great move, especially for high schoolers who are probably in an uncertain position,” said Eric Balderas ’13, who drew public attention when he faced and ultimately avoided deportation in 2010.
An undocumented Harvard Divinity School student who requested anonymity said that the bill would have given him a sense of security during his undergraduate years.
“College was a mixture of really great fun and a huge learning experience, but it was very much marked by my legal status,” he said. “There were a lot of things I couldn’t do and didn’t have access to because of this attribute.”
Other students disapproved of the executive order. Harvard Republican Club President Derek J. Bekebrede ’13 said in an email that he thinks the order represents an abuse of power.
“After eight years of liberal scrutiny of the imperial presidency under Bush, I would expect more from Democrats who now seem to think that the President can do whatever he wants as long as they like it,” Bekebrede wrote. “A slow moving Congress is not reason enough to disregard the Constitution.”
Immigration activists, however, called for the president to do more, not less. The order is only a step toward comprehensive immigration reform, proponents said, as it falls short of the policies proposed by the DREAM Act.
“We must continue to work for a more permanent legislative solution that embraces and enlists the talent and aspirations of these extraordinary young people, but this executive action is a most welcome step,” Faust wrote.
Though Balderas applauded the order, he took issue with the limited scope of undocumented immigrants to whom it applies.
“We shouldn’t forget about our parents and everyone else who stands to benefit from comprehensive immigration reform,” Balderas said.  “I think all of these are steps to that. My ultimate hope is to deal with it in its entirety—not only deal with the youth, but with our parents, who got us here.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Radcliffe heavyweight varsity eight brought home a second-place finish in the Henley Women’s Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, England, on Sunday, easily beating Thames/Henley before losing in the last race of the regatta to Tees Composite, a team of elite U-23 British rowers.
The second varsity eight won its first race against Reading before losing in the quarterfinals to the crew from Molesey Boat Club.
The 1V was granted a bye in the first round of the regatta, meaning it did not have to race in the rough conditions on the Thames on Saturday. That set Radcliffe up for an unlikely victory over Thames/Henley, a local squad which had extensive experience on the distinctive River Thames and which had easily beaten Holy Cross the day before.
While Radcliffe’s victory over Thames/Henley came by a length and a half, the crew fell to Tees Composite in the finals by just half a length. Tees Composite completed the race in 5:20—the fastest time in the entire regatta, and 22 seconds faster than it had rowed in the semifinals.
The Black and White fell behind Tees Composite early in the race, according to rising senior and 1V stroke Shelley Pearson, as the Brits managed to put open water between their stern and Radcliffe’s bow. But Radcliffe came back from the deficit to pull within just half a length, which Pearson said, in an email, the crew was “very excited with.”
“I think generally, everyone gave a very impressive fight in all of our races and had an invaluable experience figuring out such challenging conditions,” Pearson wrote.
Liz Soutter ’12, the 1V six-seat, wrote in an email that the Black and White had one of its “best races of the season against the Tees Composite crew.”
Conditions dramatically improved between Saturday and Sunday. Crews which won races on both Saturday and Sunday rowed, on average, a full minute faster on Sunday, dropping from 7:18 to 6:20.
The regatta is held on the River Thames and is described by British Rowing as “one of the highlights of the regattas season for women rowers across the globe.” It is unique in that, due to the river's narrow width, races are all one-on-one, unlike most races, in which multiple boats row against each other. In addition, the race is 1500 meters long—500 meters shorter than a standard race and about 500 meters shorter than the Henley Royal Regatta, which takes place along a similar stretch of the Thames.

CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the Radcliffe 1V lost to University College Dublin in the finals. In fact, the Black and White fell to Tees Composite.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Coming off its first NCAA tournament appearance since 1946, the Harvard men’s basketball team is lining up a tough non-conference schedule before it begins next year’s Ivy League season.
CBSSports’ Jon Rothstein reported yesterday that Harvard will face Saint Mary’s, California, and Memphis in 2012-2013, all on the road.
The official schedule from Harvard Athletics for the upcoming season lists only five games so far—the Crimson’s home-and-away series with Brown and Yale, and a game at home against Holy Cross—meaning that Harvard may have other games against major conference opponents that have not yet been announced. WEEI also reported that Harvard will play Boston College again next year, a team that the Crimson has now defeated in four straight meetings.
Over the past several seasons, Harvard has had increasing success against major programs in the early part of the year. The team won the Battle 4 Atlantis over Thanksgiving break in the Bahamas after with wins Utah, Florida St., and Central Florida. The team also lost three of its non-league games—at UConn, at Fordham, and against Vanderbilt in the NCAA Tournament—finishing the year with a 14-3 non-Ivy record.
Harvard is 0-2 all-time against Cal, though the two haven’t met in a little over a decade. The Crimson has never played Saint Mary’s or Memphis in its program history.
Despite Harvard’s title in the Ancient Eight last season, the Crimson isn’t the only team to have games slated against major-conference opponents. Of the matchups scheduled and announced for next season, perhaps the most surprising is Yale’s Jan. 6 game against Florida in New Haven, as it is rarity for a team from a power conference like the SEC to agree to play in the cramped facilities of the Ivy League.
Harvard will announce the rest of its schedule later in the summer.

It's an argument almost as old as the burrito itself, and students for generations have devoted untold hours to debating the best burrito joint in Harvard Square. Over the past few days, members of The Crimson's summer staff have made a case the Big 4 of Square burritos: Boloco, Chipotle, Felipe's, and, now, Qdoba.
For those of you that love Qdoba, this article probably isn’t worth your time—you know it all, anyway. But for the less enlightened among you who don’t agree, allow me to explain.
We’ll start off with my favorite stage of burrito-brawling: the bashing. When you really think about it, it’s easy to see why anyone who goes elsewhere to satisfy their burrito cravings is seriously delusional.
Felipe’s? Taco Bell in disguise. If you’re looking for a low-quality burrito made with low-quality meat, cheese, and grease, then be my guest. Enjoy navigating through the drunken mob, its biggest group of customers—which says a lot about its food. As for me, I’d like to live past 30.
Boloco? If you want a milkshake, fine. If you want a bland burrito, I really have nothing to say to you. Ever. And mango salsa on a burrito? Something is seriously wrong with the world.
Chipotle? Some say it’s Qdoba’s biggest competitor. I say its over-spiced ingredients and plastic-textured tortillas make it Qdoba’s trash can. A trash can that’s way too far away, especially in the winter.
But Qdoba is classier than bashing on other restaurants, even if I’m not. Qdoba only needs to show off itself. Its meat, especially the steak, is fantastic, perfectly cooked every time. And its veggies are just as good—good enough to eat alone as fajitas, important for non-bean-eating clientele who couldn’t go elsewhere. Extras of most things are free, and adding another touch of sour cream and cheese makes any Qdoba burrito absolutely perfect.
Its location is ideal for any student who wants a quick bite, and its spacious interior fits all its customers comfortably (unlike Boloco, where your burrito is likely to get trampled if you drop it on the floor—where it belongs). And an abundance of coupons distributed throughout the year makes it even more student-friendly.
Qdoba. We saved the best for last.
