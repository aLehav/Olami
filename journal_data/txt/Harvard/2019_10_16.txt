It’s already well into October, and with the encroaching cold, you’re going to need more than hot apple cider to warm you up. So turn off the lights, pop some corn, type in that familiar web domain, and enjoy these new Netflix shows.
“Raising Dion” (Season 1)
This show is filled with the magical, childlike wonder that comes with one day discovering that you have superpowers. Such joy! Starring and produced by Michael B. Jordan, the show centers around the life of a second-grade boy named Dion (Ja’Siah Young) and his single mother, Nicole (Alisha Wainwright), who grieve the death of the father, played by Jordan. In mourning, Dion and Nicole discover that Dion has gained superpowers, and the extent of Dion’s abilities are insane — imagine floating toys, fish suspended out of water in the sky, teleportation, and being super good at botany. Additionally, the government is supposedly tracking down people with superpowers. Is little Dion safe in this big, cruel world? Watch the first season of the show to find out.
“Big Mouth” (Season 3)
The new season of “Big Mouth” is about to get a whole lot cringier and raunchier than ever before. It’s hard not to get the shudders while watching this show, which is about middle school, puberty, first kisses, hormone monsters, and dreams where vaginas become talk show hosts. It is wildly inappropriate and disgusting, but it is precisely this vulgar honesty which has contributed to its being honored as one of “Netflix’s best animated shows for your grown-up self” among others, such as “BoJack Horseman.” So “Big Mouth” gets credit for being quite so uncomfortable to watch — it is loudly and unashamedly bold in its self-expression and not afraid of being what it is: a big lump of profanity and good old dirty humor.
“Rotten” (Season 2)
Here comes a reality shock to everyone who eats, drinks, and everyone who lives. Food: no one can live without it. But the truth behind its origins is not always as pretty as it may seem. That’s exactly what “Rotten” tries to teach us: The way most of our food gets made, packaged, and sold is full of corruption, and fraudulence and has great moral consequence. The bottled water industry, for example, “has made something out of nothing,” tricking people into paying money for something they could get out of their own kitchen sinks. Much of commercially-sold chocolate is unsustainable, farmed for cheap by impoverished farmers who do not receive a fair trading wage. The show turns the fairly inconsequential issue of thinking about food into an urgent humanitarian crisis — try chewing on that during your next meal at HUDS.
“Living Undocumented” (Season 1)
“Living Undocumented” depicts the reality of what it’s like to live everyday as an undocumented immigrant. The central theme is fear: the fear of living in the shadows, of becoming separated from one’s family, of disappearing, and of being deported. In this show produced by Selena Gomez, undocumented immigrants speak up about their lives and family experiences for the rest of the world to know. It discusses how immigration policies such as the Zero-Tolerance Policy has separated children from their parents and forced them to return to a land where they don’t have a home. In an article published by Time Magazine, Gomez discusses her own family history of coming from an undocumented lineage, which started with her aunt crossing the border, hidden in the back of a truck. Gomez says that she thinks about the issue of undocumented immigration every day, out of fear for the nation and empathy for the people. The show lends a sympathetic lens and sheds light on the cruel reality of their world. One of the immigrants on the show said it best: “I wasn’t blessed to be born in this country. But my heart is American.”

“A demoness is what men call a goddess they can’t control,” opens “The Never Tilting World,” the latest fantasy novel from Rin Chupeco, of “Bone Witch” trilogy fame. Touted as “Furyborn” meets “Mad Max,” the novel has everything: magic, romance, adventure, danger, and so much more that makes for an exciting read that also stands up to scrutiny of its deeper meaning. As Chupeco pulls us through the physically broken world of her creation, Aeon, she presents commentary on the state of the real world, touching on issues that one might consider contributors to cracks in our societal foundation.
“The Never Tilting World” explores dualities of all shapes and sizes within its pages, following the threads of four young people who travel to the literal edge of their world in search of healing and answers. After the Breaking, a cataclysmic event that brought the planet’s rotation to a grinding halt and doomed the two halves to eternal sunshine or eternal night, the twin goddesses who ruled Aeon are relegated to jurisdiction over their respective realms. But this broken world needs mending, and it is their daughters, Odessa and Haidee, who are called to the Great Abyss that rends the world in search of peace for themselves and their people. Accompanied by a healer bodyguard and a snarky fire wielding desert clansman, respectively, they must find their way through treacherous physical and emotional territory for answers about themselves and their pasts, as well as a way to fix a world torn asunder.
Though this fantasy world shows unimaginable extremes of blistering desert city and stormy wave-besieged metropolis, the book draws immediate parallels to the real world with its encroaching threats of ever more destructive climate change. In the very first few chapters, the parallels are blatant — “winter had traveled closer this year,” and Odessa’s primary job as princess is to aid in warding off the threats of permafrost to their ocean city — which grants the readers a frank discussion of the dangers of melting permafrost and rising ocean levels.
Though not as overt as in these first few chapters, Chupeco makes a point of integrating a discussion of nature and its balance, shown primarily by Odessa’s newfound powers. Every feat of magic comes with a price: She is able to grow plentiful crops and luscious vegetation, but the land becomes almost instantaneously barren — a nod to agricultural devastation and overuse of land. Though taking the book (with its discussion of fate and predetermined destiny) might spiral one into pessimism, Chupeco’s tale doesn’t seem to deliver a doomsday prophecy, but simply a warning: It’s time to make a change before it’s too late to save this broken world.
Chupeco brilliantly inserts nuggets of commentary on gender roles and stereotypes into her novel, refusing to bend to such stereotypes and building far more interesting characters as a result. For example, Haidee is reminiscent of the classic tomboy — but rarely do we see major female characters getting their hands dirty with machinery. Though Arjun, her partner, is far less sheltered, Haidee is the one who uses her “mechanika” skills to rebuild their vehicle to withstand the desert conditions. In the other realm, Gracea, the highest ranking authority among Odessa’s team of soldiers, exhibits abusive tendencies that historically fall more towards male characters in stories. As a matter of fact, all the high ranking soldiers, male and female, exhibit these abusive behaviors towards their servants (clerks), which in a sense is a relatively radical statement in itself — though this isn’t a particularly heartening example, it does very purposefully alter the stereotype for such stories.
The romantic narratives also involve a discussion of class. It’s a classic story of a princess and commoner who fall into forbidden love — one that both Odessa and Haidee contend with. What elevates their stories are the separate intricacies entangled within: Odessa is lesbian, and her love for Lan is forbidden because she must produce an heir. Chupeco does create a powerful message here, no question. By placing the relationship parallel to another (heterosexual) classic love story, Chupeco normalizes Odessa’s feelings in a way that showcases, unobtrusively, that these stories can exist in just the same space as heterosexual stories can.
Night and day, living and dead, fire and water: two sisters, two worlds, two journeys. With four perspectives to draw on, Chupeco weaves an intricate tale riddled with dualities that creates an entertaining read but also contends with many real world issues. “A Never Tilting World” is more than a story of adventure, of elemental magic, and of betrayal and destiny. The sequel will undoubtedly be one to watch out for.

Lacking the core advantage of a continuous plot, anthologies of short stories can feel like an overwhelming whirlwind of incongruous tales, jumping from story to story within a matter of mere pages. It’s one thing to slowly digest the stories filed under the New Yorker’s “Flash Fiction” section, yet another to keep up with the racing, mental vertigo-inducing shifts of setting, character, and conflict in an anthology.
“Grand Union,” Zadie Smith’s latest release, manages to mitigate this caveat with ease. Although not avoiding it altogether, this diverse collection of stories written in dazzling, pitch-perfect prose contains a central thread: personal tragedies. To create these sensitive, cutting stories, Smith uses poignant and heartbreakingly accurate descriptions, oftentimes at the expense of sufficiently comprehensive plots. At times, this works in her favor, but other times it doesn’t — luckily the versatility of a collection allows for both successes and failures.
In the outstanding “The Lazy River,” the stream-of-consciousness narrations are captivating and full of Smith’s proclivity for the colorful and oddly specific. They follow the structure of an inner monologue, one that ends almost as soon as it begins, and lack entirely conclusive endings due to their stream-of-consciousness nature. “The Lazy River” is an intentionally vague commentary of the 21st century mores that have held us hostage in subliminal ways. The story itself is self-aware of the lazy river as a metaphor for numbly drifting with the current of society, which prevents it from becoming another trite, reflexive rejection of questionable societal paradigms. To create this self-aware story, Smith interweaves specific yet minute details of reality with the metaphor itself: “Even if you don’t move you will get somewhere and then return to wherever you started, and if we may speak of the depth of a metaphor, well, then, it is about three feet deep, excepting a brief stretch at which point it rises to six feet four.”
The technique falls flat in other stories, such as “Miss Adele Amidst the Corsets,” that have a narrative with more concrete characters and settings. It’s not that these stories lack Smith’s signature eloquent prose, and it’s not difficult to grasp the complex, raw emotions that the characters feel. But when the bulk of the story is dedicated to these poetic descriptions, it is hard to be reeled into the story itself. The painstakingly detailed interactions between the characters seem unnecessary and futile when placed inside the slow-moving plots that never quite reach the zenith of their potential.
However, Smith is able to find an optimal balance between the plot and the elaborate descriptions in other stories. “Big Week,” a story that uncovers the causes of a long-married couple’s separation, achieves this. The development in this story is clever, as it switches from the husband’s perspective and ends on the wife’s perspective: “Time began to cautiously reshape itself around her broken body, and she found she wanted to be alone with it once more.” This abrupt switch of perspective reframes the story not as a relationship destroyed by some external force, but rather as a woman’s search for fulfillment — something that a man ultimately could not and is in no place to control.
These stories aren’t entirely a form of literary escapism. In the moments that they appear to be so, they will awaken the reader out of a state of reverie with subtle social commentaries. Smith doesn’t force these down the reader’s throat, but deftly weaves them in, perhaps like chocolate cake discreetly flecked with shreds of zucchini. She explores “wokeness” and how fragile and self-interested the foundations of one’s wokeness can be in “Just Right.” In “Downtown,” Smith briefly refers to the Kavanaugh hearings with apt frustration, seeming to make a statement about a woman’s right and need to take up space.
Will the short story ever be perfected? Perhaps we can unfix our gaze on the standard, archetypal figures whose works have been beaten to death in our 10th grade English classes and instead direct our attention towards Smith, who has demonstrated an unparalleled ability to capture the hardening struggles of life alongside the bursting epiphanies — the complete, tragic range of the human experience, in economical bundles that when combined, do in fact coalesce to form — get this — a grand union.

Still listening to Hayley Kiyoko in 2019? Unable to wrench yourself from music’s “lesbian Jesus”? Found yourself justifying the recycled synth and overt autotune of “Girls Like Girls” because, well, what other options are there?
In honor of this past weekend’s National Coming Out Day, here’s a list of all the queer musical goddesses you could possibly want.
5.“Temptation” by Raveena
Tired of sad-girl ballads about death and acupuncture? Raveena describes her music as “tinsel-y escapism”; on her debut album, “Shanti,” she blends queer and Southeast Asian culture in the luscious, silky warmth of her soothing instrumentals. As it has evolved, her music seems more and more like a celebration of her culture, her identity, and her love. On songs like “Still Dreaming” and “Temptation,” the impossible lightness of her voice beckons the listener out of reality and into the magic of airy imagination.
4. “Back in Your Arms” by Carlie Hanson
Carlie Hanson is young, fresh, and charming; at 17, she’s already hailed by many as an effervescent, tough-to-define rising star. Most of her discography straddles two worlds: in love and heartbroken, classic and millenial, pop and anything-but. Running through all of it, however, is an absolute earnestness. Whether it's the passion she has for her friends, on “Hazel” or “WYA,” or her girlfriend, on the adorable “Us”, she sounds like the kind of person you’d always want in your corner. That earnest energy ripples through her voice — powerful, yearning, and with a kind of unedited intimacy. Of course, my favorite song will always be “Back in Your Arms,” a song that imbues the simple longing of a breakup song with all the little, natural details of falling in love with a woman.
3. “Prophet” by King Princess
20-year-old King Princess isn’t just an iconic queer heartthrob — she’s also an absolute genius of a musician. Sarcastic and charming, she flaunts the rules of pop music in her lyrics, her online persona, and her identity, but she is just as boundary-pushing in the sonic lines she crosses in her music itself. She really can’t release a bad song (which is a relief, because I played those 5 songs on her first EP more times than I’d like to admit.) They’re instantly catchy (just try to get “Cheap Queen” out of your head), with perfectly constructed choruses where no syllable feels wasted, and every line of synth, drums, or piano seems right where it’s supposed to be. But have you, like me, already heard “1950” way too many times? Try “Prophet” on her new EP — this jazzy, understated banger just gets richer with each new listen.
2. “PYNK” by Janelle Monáe
Janelle Monae needs little introduction. She’s a visionary in every sense of the word, from her stunning, interconnected music videos to her singular musical and visual relationship with femininity and futuristic tech. She’s a singular leader, challenging the status quo not just with frustration but absolute elegance, infectious energy, and boundless creativity. Songs off her newest album “Crazy, Classic, Life” and “Make Me Feel” radiate pure sensuality and joy. But if you're looking for pussy power, you can’t get much better than “PYNK.”
1. “She” by Dodie
I think it’s fair to say I’m more than a little in love with Dodie Clark. She is, perhaps, the most unbelievably honest artist I’ve ever heard: so utterly, rivetingly genuine that it is all but impossible to look away. Her lyrics sound simple on first listen, but every word contains a little hum of meaning, with the intricacies of her life folded into neat metaphors about party tattoos and dentists and sunflowers. In the push and pull of her piano and guitar — even limited to a single note on “Secret for the Mad,” she pours out love and darkness and hope with utter precision. And on “She,” she is in true, raw form, with no doubt or insecurity of her love edited out, but each rough human edge preserved in romantic, painstaking musical detail.

There are some artists who transcend genre, embedding themselves so deeply in the cultural zeitgeist that at any given moment, they both shape and reflect the masses who adore them. Jennifer Lopez is one such — if not, the — artist of the last two decades. Critics tend to underestimate Lopez, describing her, albeit admiringly, as the most influential Latinx performer of her generation. But much like Warhol or Tupac, the rise and fall — and the rise again — of J-Lo is instrumental to the superstructure of all contemporary American culture. With her new film “Hustlers” taking flight at the box office and generating long-overdue awards buzz for Lopez and a constant flow of press junkets to look forward to, not to mention a Super Bowl halftime performance looming on the horizon, it’s time to dive into the history of J-Lo, which is, essentially, the history of the modern American cultural project. The year 2001, while politically and socially important for many reasons, is also a crucial year for the purpose of unpacking the J-Lo narrative, and must be studied as such with care.
The #1 Album
Having released her bilingual debut album “On the 6” to substantial commercial success in 1999, J.Lo took the natural next step to superstardom in the age of narcissism and released an eponymous record, “J-Lo,” in January 2001. Hit singles included “Love Don’t Cost a Thing,” a glittery ode to late-stage capitalism’s crushing influence on modern relationships, and “I’m Real,” a lamentation for transparency in the digital age (“I’m real / what you get is what you see,” Lopez insists). The album shot to the top of the charts, achieving number one status in the U.S. and Canada Billboard charts. That September, Lopez performed a remix of “I’m Real” with Ja Rule at the MTV Video Music Awards, cementing her status not just as a triple threat but also as a cross-genre icon of performance.
The #1 Movie
Yes, in 2001, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey represented peak rom-com casting. Funny how some things never change. “The Wedding Planner” is a delightful romp with no originality, save the architecture of the critical meet-cute: Lopez gets her heel stuck in a street grate and is physically swept off her feet to safety by a heroic McConaughey. More importantly, though, is the fact that in January, “The Wedding Planner” opened as the number one movie in America. And thus January 2001 marked a seismic cultural achievement for Lopez, unmatched by any artist of her age: She held both the number one movie and the number one album at the same time. If careers have cycles, Lopez’s subsequent attempts at omnipresence are inarguably an attempt to return to this moment of sheer and unrivaled cultural dominance.
“J.Lo by Jennifer Lopez:” The Fashion Line
It is impossible to forget what happened just before this apex year, and not only because the internet has rehashed and dissected it to pieces this week. According to legend, the green Versace dress that J.Lo wore to the 2000 Grammys is what caused Google to invent Google Images. Just last month, Lopez, in a genius promotional stunt, celebrated the 20th anniversary of that pre-viral moment by wearing an identical version of the dress and strutting down the Versace Fashion Week runway in all of her preposterously toned, 50-year-old glory. This is to say that there is a legitimate case to be made for Jennifer Lopez and her daring v-neck as archetypal fashion icon of this bizarre and hyper-performative 21st century. Yet Lopez made sure to enshrine her lifestyle clout in the year 2001 by founding her successful fashion line. At a press conference, she told reporters, “It’s time for the world to wear my look.” Indeed, this sporty-chic line cemented Lopez’s status as the aught’s supreme arbiter of mass culture in nearly every conceivable realm — the stage, the screen, the radio, and the all-important closet.
In the coming years, perfumes, reality shows, and tabloid drama would follow, but 2001 marked the beginning of the J.Lo mythology, the codification of a superstar who would endure past her contemporaries and into the birth of a new cultural age.
(All incredulities about the complete seriousness of this argument should be directed to the author, who is not whatsoever joking)

In the survival reality TV series “Show Me the Money,” South Korea’s most talented rappers of all stripes — mainstream and underground, rookie and experienced — appear before established celebrity rappers and producers, who decide which contestants move on in the competition each week.
Rappers join “crews,” each led by a team of judges, and after passing the preliminary rounds which consist of one-on-one diss battles and collaboration tracks, they have the opportunity to showcase their music in live concerts and release song tracks featuring well-known artists. Having grown in popularity since its first airing in 2012, the show has spread a far-sweeping wave of Korean hip-hop across the nation and far overseas.
With season eight drawing to a close, crowning moss-haired “CORONA” rapper Punchnello as champion, let’s take a look back at some of the all-time top “Show Me the Money” contestants and their best performances on the show. Here’s hoping this list of contestants and songs will wish you another killer “Good Day.”
BewhY (Season Five Winner)
BewhY, known for his intense, staccato delivery and his devotedly spiritual lyrics, became one of the most influential figures in the mainstream Korean hip-hop scene. His iconic “Forever” and jazzy “Day Day” embody his artistic prowess, pouring out an incredible amount of lyrics with ease, and to this day, stand as his central works.
For his final performance, BewhY pushed for a musical-themed collaboration with his brother’s acapella group, “Fake pt. 2.” In a gritty group collaboration, “Who You?,” BewhY performed like clockwork alongside his teammates ONE (Jung Jae Won), G2 from Hi-Lite Records, and AOMG Entertainment producers Simon Dominic and Gray.
Featuring his childhood friend and season five’s runner-up C-Jamm (Just Music), he released “Puzzle,” which climbed to the top spot of eight South Korean music sites’ real-time charts. The duo followed up with “Wright Brothers,” a bright, poppy complement to their cutting style. After establishing his own label (Dejavu Group), BewhY returned to SMTM’s season eight to serve as one of the judges, delivering a potent lineup of songs for his producers performance, including his most recent title track “Gottasadae.”
Woo Won Jae (Season Six Finalist)
Though starting off the season as a not-well-known underground rookie, Woo Won Jae, with his distinctive husky, coarse tone and darkly philosophical lyrics, swiftly rose to the ranks, leaving the show with a full-on contract with hip-hop record label AOMG.
With his signature beanie, Woo Won Jae began the show with a crude, honest acapella audition where he rapped about the hardships of anxiety and depression, appearing “Again” in a live dark-and-light dialogue of raw emotions with Feel Ghood Music artists Tiger JK (founding member of Drunken Tiger), Bizzy, and MRSHLL. Woo Won Jae returned to the semi-finals stage with a similar ghostly, percussive vibe in “ZINZA,” which means “real” or “authentic” in Korean, that featured the angelic chorus of singer-songwriter Suran (Million Market) and the woozy energy of YDG (Polaris Entertainment).
His unperformed final-stage song, “We Are,” featuring Gray and season one winner Loco (AOMG), topped the Korean music chart. Since the end of the season, he has released “a fence” as part of his extended play “af” and appeared in “Run It” alongside AOMG CEO Jay Park and “Unpretty Rapstar” personality Jessi.
Superbee (Season Four, Season Five Finalist, Season Seven Semi-Finalist)
With a brash reputation for diss battles, Superbee passed the first round for three seasons in total, returning yet again with his smooth, fast-paced rap skills, sharpening his sword every season. Some of his notable songs in season five include the bright-popping “Sun Block” with Microdot and the boom-bap heavy “Air DoTheQ” with his teammates Flowsik, myunDo, and Kim Hyo Eun, produced by Illionaire Records co-founders Dok2 and The Quiett.
Superbee returned in season seven with his fluid rap skillbase as usual, with an added uplifting singing rap in “Selfmade Orange” featuring Ambition Musik’s Changmo and biting rhymes in “SUPERBEEWHY” featuring BewhY. Superbee has since launched his own label Yng & Rich Records with fellow rapper Uneducated Kid.
Rhythm Power (Season Four, Season Five, Season Six Winner)
A powerhouse trio composed of individual rappers Boi-B, Geegoin, and Hangzoo, Rhythm Power (Amoeba Culture) appeared with a catchy brass hook in a lyrically humourous, rhythmically playful callout to “Horangnabi.” Hangzoo won in season six, with a hypnotic “Red Sun” with rap mogul Swings and a nostalgic remake of his first single, “bestdriverZ,” with Zion.T (The Black Label) and R&B singer-songwriter Dean (Universal Music Group).”
Most recently, Hangzoo returned to the Show Me the Money stage to perform in Punchnello’s “Magma.” Rhythm Power has since reverted to an old-school yet trendy style, releasing an album titled “Project A” nine years after their debut.
Bobby & Mino (Season Three Winner, Season Four Runner-Up)
Both entering the competition as idol rappers based in YG Entertainment, Bobby from iKON won season three as a trainee, and Mino from WINNER placed second place behind season four champion and “GXNZI” rapper Basick.
Bobby unveiled his raw, rowdy energy in “YGGR,” sharing his financial struggles in a hard-hitting acapella rap, and bounces wild with the crowd in “Raise Your Guard And Bounce.” Bobby returned in season five with his swagger-filled hand gestures and fan service in Hi-Lite Reddy’s flamboyant “Like This.”
Following Bobby’s footsteps, Mino entered season four soaring in a blasting “Turtle Ship.” In collaboration with BIGBANG star Taeyang, Mino revealed a heart-wrenching “Fear.” In the final round, Mino clowned around in “Okey Dokey” with Block B’s rapper Zico (Stardom Entertainment), adding on a skittish dance. Mino returned for a producer’s performance of “Machine Gun” in season five.
The two have since formed a sub-unit under YG Entertainment, MOBB, releasing an album titled “The MOBB” with fiery numbers “Hit Me” and “Full House,” Mino’s solo number “Body,” a melodic jam with trap-heavy beats, and Bobby’s tribal-themed number “Holup!”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Tuesday, the University released the results to the 2019 Association of American Universities Student Survey on Sexual Assault and Misconduct, in which Harvard students were asked to complete last April. The data tell a disturbing story. Sexual and gender-based harassment and assault remain a serious problem here at Harvard, and at institutions of higher education nationwide.
Since 2015, when Harvard conducted a similar survey with AAU, the prevalence of sexual assault here, and at the other participating universities, has remained largely unchanged. As members of the University leadership, we take these results very seriously, and we recognize that we have a responsibility to each and every member of the community to respond to them, and to find ways to create a safer place to learn and to work.
We are grateful to the more than 8,300 students at Harvard, and more than 180,000 students at AAU universities across the country, who took the significant step of devoting their time to respond to this survey, to ponder difficult questions, and for some, to share details of life experiences that are not easy to discuss. It’s clear from this engaged response that many students are committed to creating a better Harvard, free from sexual harassment and assault. This is what encourages us.
The enhancement of resources to serve those who experience sexual assault, and improvements in university procedures, are critical steps that Harvard must continue to take. But changes to policy and additional resources alone cannot effect the change we need to achieve our ultimate goal, which is to prevent sexual assault from occurring in the first place. This requires a concerted, collaborative effort from each of us, faculty, staff, administrators and especially students. We’re hopeful that many of you are willing to join us in this challenge. The culture at Harvard can’t change without your involvement.
Overwhelmingly, at Harvard and at the other AAU member institutions who participated in this survey, sexual assault occurs between students, usually when alcohol has been consumed, and most often on campus. At Harvard, 80 percent of incidents of sexual assault involved alcohol, while more than 75 percent of the incidents involved an offender who was a fellow student. For undergraduates, two thirds of the incidents of sexual assault reported in the AAU survey took place in on-campus housing.
We need your help to change this culture, by letting your peers know that sexual misconduct is never acceptable, and then by finding ways to support those individuals who experience harassment or assault. Already, Harvard students participating in programs like bystander training help to drive home this point. Let’s work together to find more solutions.
Last week, in response to student input, the Title IX Office launched an online anonymous disclosure form as an additional tool for reporting an incident. This supplements the efforts of the more than 50 Title IX coordinators University-wide who stand ready to support Harvard’s students, faculty, and staff who experience sexual harassment or assault. We’re hopeful that adding an anonymous reporting option will help people share information so that we will have a clearer picture, in real time, of what is occurring and whether our interventions are making a difference. Taking such a first step may lead some to seek additional assistance.
One of the most heartbreaking realities that we learned through this survey is that, while increasing numbers of students are aware of the widespread resources we offer through our Title IX Office, the Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response, and Harvard’s individual schools and units, few take advantage of these resources. Students cite that the incident wasn’t “serious enough,” that they weren’t injured, that alcohol or drugs were involved, or even, that “events like this seem common” as reasons to not access any of the support services available on campus. Students, faculty, staff and University administrators need to work together to make it clear that sexual assault is unacceptable and to communicate that all sexual assault is – and will be treated as — “serious enough.” Simultaneously, we need to respect some students’ preference for seeking support from family and friends, and acknowledge the effectiveness of this approach.
The challenge of building a community where sexual assault and harassment no longer exist is vast. But this is a goal to which we must aspire. At Harvard, we consider ourselves leaders, innovators, and changemakers. When you leave here, you will have an impact on the communities where you live and work, and, as Harvard graduates, you will be in a position to make change happen. We pledge to work alongside you while you are here to build a safer community. We’re hopeful that you can further this shared commitment to creating a world free of sexual harassment and assault once you move on to future endeavors. Together, we can have an impact at Harvard and beyond.
Peggy Newell is Deputy Provost at Harvard University. Kathleen L. McGinn is a professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. They served as co-chairs of the steering committee for the Harvard Student Survey on Sexual Assault & Misconduct.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The University’s Title IX Office launched an anonymous online reporting system last week, which hopes to make it easier for students to report incidents of sexual misconduct. The form heavily emphasizes privacy and anonymity, monitored by an external agency and linked to the Title IX office via a generated and anonymous user login. The form’s optional questions allow potential reporters to share as much or as little as they would like.
When plans for this system were released this summer, we felt the announcement lacked sufficient details for us to weigh in on the form’s merits. But now that the form has been fully unveiled, we are pleased with how student input was considered in its creation, and support its introduction.
We believe the anonymous reporting form functions well as an option for those who may be uncomfortable sharing experiences of sexual or gender-based misconduct in person or simply non-anonymously. We have called on Harvard to strengthen its infrastructure for supporting victims of sexual misconduct in the past, and we commend it for creating a new resource that supports students and faculty.
The original version of the form was designed in a way that made many students uncomfortable regarding their anonymity, and responding to such feedback, the Title IX Office updated the form accordingly. We believe these adjustments will increase the form’s effectiveness, because they make respondents more likely to share their experiences. We appreciate the effort the office has put into genuinely eliciting and engaging with student perspectives.
We are also glad that the platform is communication-focused and not necessarily geared toward a flurry of next steps and follow-up actions. The primary purpose of the system is to help victims, not pursue perpetrators. As such, the platform will hopefully provide a space for students to express their experiences and trauma in a way that feels contained and controlled, and that takes into consideration their emotional response to reporting.
In the wake of the recently released Association of American Universities’ Student Survey on Sexual Assault, it is important to consider how victims of misconduct perceive their experiences and feel comfortable reporting them. Given the survey’s statistic that only 41 percent of women and 27 percent of men made contact with a Harvard program or resource after situations involving “penetration involving physical force or inability to consent,” it is important for the University to consider how to make resources such as this form more available to survivors. Moreover, this platform may be an opportunity to collect additional, aggregate and non-personalized data on misconduct across campus, and increase the Title IX office’s awareness of certain patterns and trends manifesting in reports.
We hope Harvard will continue to work with students to increase awareness as this tool goes into effect. Information and support is essential, and students should have more knowledge about the resources available to them. There is little point in having a resource that people do not know about or know how to use. The University should continue to help students and faculty understand the differences between reporting-based resources available to victims of misconduct.
Though we do not expect it to, we hope the University also does not use this tool as a justification to cut down on elements of the Title IX Office and automate other aspects of student care, as Harvard University Health Services did with Urgent Care and its new tele-nurse program. Telecommunications and Internet technologies are not a replacement for in-person care, and though many students may value their anonymity, others may value other more interpersonal means of reportage.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Listen, we’ve all been there. You’re at a party off-campus, or a bar in the city, or back wherever you call home. You’re probably trawling for your next midnight conquest, so you are striking up conversations with attractive strangers. Maybe you’re interesting, you can hold a conversation, or your go-to method is just to ask more questions than a section kid — whatever the case may be, the words are flowing and you think they might be interested in going home with you tonight.
Then they look at you and say, “So, where do you go to college?”
Damn! You didn’t think it would come to this, but here we are again — decision time. It’s just you, the nuclear football, and this poor unwilling victim who has placed themselves squarely in your reticule. So, do you blow this fool to kingdom come, or do you try to snake your way around the topic? Yes, this is the classic Harvard dilemma that dogs all ivy-crested Crimson scholars the moment they venture beyond the Harvard bubble — under what circumstances might one ethically drop the H-bomb?
OK, first off, calm down. You’re half as important as you think you are and twice as obnoxious. And you know what, we get it, some people are really impressed by the Harvard brand, and when they learn what your alma mater is, they can make things a bit cringy. But we all need to stop pretending like we’re dropping some kind of “bomb” on these bombshells at the bar. You are not some B-list celebrity just because you went to Harvard — at best, you’re just a clout-chaser who came here for the name. Sure, you might be “wicked smaht,” but that does not make you more important than your handsome average Joe.
Why should you be insecure about going to Harvard? Much ink has already been spilled over the H-bomb. Perhaps most obliviously, Deena Shakir ’08 said in her Class Day oration, “Just imagine the global fallout of the H-bomb of 2008,” among a series of other strained nuclear metaphors. To be clear, Shakir was trying to compare the reach of thermonuclear warheads with the power of education. Bombs seem to me a more apt metaphor for the kind of naked power which Harvard Class Day speakers often foresee Harvard graduates wielding, as not just “our future” (in that tired graduation day cliche), but as “our future leaders.” Shakir is now a partner at a multi-billion dollar venture capital firm (alums, this is the voice of history speaking — if you H-bombed your way into wealth and power, you better be using the resources at your disposal to better ends than just yourself and your children, else I’ll speak of you harshly, if I speak of you at all).
Let’s look at this “bomb” thing again. Harvard is the international center of elite privilege, it is the gateway for all “lower” classes to enter the meritocratic elite, and it has more money than 109 countries. Anyone who thinks they “deserve” to go here is an asshole, because nobody deserves to go here — the ideal of the “perfect student,” which Harvard’s brand is built around, is unsustainable and unrealistic, and the idea that the 95.5 percent of applicants who were rejected last year all deserved to be cut is a farce. The real “bomb” is not the H-bomb. It is the bomb that wiped out all the other applicants and left standing only us — we, the freaks, the mutants, the traumatized cockroaches who, spared from the horrors of “obscurity,” are left to gaze upon the ruins of our dreams.
Now, dear reader, I’m going to lay it on you heavy here, but only because I know you can handle it. When you enrolled in Harvard College, you sold out. There is no way to ethically drop the H-bomb, because there is no ethical reason to have an H-bomb.
But if the Manhattan Project that is your life has already built the bomb, you might as well embrace it. What are you going to do, drop out? Tear up your degree? No, you are already become Death, the destroyer of worlds. If you don’t want to feel so insecure and guilty about your education, then you should be open about the privileges you enjoy and work to deconstruct the Harvard brand. And tell the beautiful stranger that you went to Harvard, for God’s sake. It’s not just “a small liberal arts college outside of Boston.” It’s a part of you now, and it’s time to own up to that fact. Who knows, maybe being honest will actually help your pompous ass get laid.

More than 500 teenage Potterheads and Dobby-eared dads listen raptly to the thin, red-headed man onstage. A wannabe Luna Lovegood makes her way to the question mic. “How did you feel when Percy abandoned his family for the Ministry of Magic?” she asks. The red-headed man onstage doesn’t hesitate. It was exactly in character for Percy, he says. Percy’s always had an ambitious streak.
He should know — the man is Chris Rankin, the actor who has played and thought about Percy Weasley for more than 20 years.
It’s a Saturday morning on the second day of the tenth annual LeakyCon, a Harry Potter convention held in a different city every year. This year, the Boston Seaport Hotel and World Trade Center welcomed a flood of robe-clad, wand-brandishing fans attending panels on topics ranging from “Magizoology: an In-Depth Examination of the Care of Magical Creatures” to “An Excess of ‘Phlegm’ and the Lack of Femme.”
Beside the B-list actor panel lies the convention’s massive “Marketplace.” Like the spawn of Diagon Alley and the Minnesota State Fair, the Marketplace brims with merchants hawking their magical goods. A sweatshirt announces “I’m 100% That Witch;” heavy, wax seals bearing the crests of Hogwarts houses stand like sacred relics on cloth-covered tables; Harry Potter and Professor Snape dolls rest side-by-side in a manner that might be more than fraternal.
A mother standing with her daughter outside of the Hungarian Wand Shop sighs loudly: “Do you really need another wand?” she asks, exasperated.
She’s lucky her daughter isn’t asking to visit the nearby Windemere Wand Shop instead. While the first store sells hand-carved wands for just $25, Windermere boasts more careful craftsmanship, designing true-to-book wands down to precise combinations of wood, core, length, and style. There, a 14½ inch carved ebony wand with a core of dragon heartstring would cost her $250.
The sincerity with which the Leakycon attendees treat panels and merchandise stores alike reveals an enduring relationship to Harry Potter: a conception of the Potterdom as an evolving universe with abiding relevance to modern life. It’s integrated into the convention via inconspicuous Lizzo references and wands only adult collectors can afford. But it’s also written all over the programming in workshops that introduce twenty-first century sensibility into a world imagined two decades ago.
Participants at a workshop titled “Trans Magic: Gender in the Wizarding World,” conduct a serious, heartfelt discussion on the role magic would play in transitioning genders. One high-school-age attendee asks the panelists, “Would medical gender transitions be needed if you can change your appearance just using magic?” After some deliberation, the group resolves: “There’s really good precedence that transition is magically possible, but it takes a lot of skill.” In a nearby room, Rankin coaches foster-care parents on how to connect to their foster children via Harry Potter lore. Later on the docket is the “Hufflepuff Guide to Self-Care” and “Hogwarts as a Home 2.0.”
This interest in expanding beyond the conventional Potter nostalgia extends to the costumes convention-goers choose, too. Hagrids lumber past fussy Umbridges; even Moaning Myrtles flit by with toilet seats hanging from their necks. The holy trinity of Harry, Hermione, and Ron, on the other hand, are ignored by the mostly over 20-something-year-old crowd.
Dank G. Marletto is a 39-year old cosplayer dressed up as Queenie from Fantastic Beasts. Marletto has been a long-time fan, but says it was only eight years ago that he first scraped together a “hand-me-down Goodwill” costume and started attending conventions.
Marletto explains the appeal of dressing as peripheral characters.
“You start by wanting to be one of the trio — Harry, Hermione, or Ron — then you start understanding the other characters and wanting to be one of the outcasts,” he says. “When you’re shunned, and your heart breaks, you start identifying with these other characters.”
And across eight years of conventions, Marletto and his friend Jay McDougall — today, dressed in full Newt Scamander garb — agree that Harry Potter conventions have become “where the magic is,” sites of community and belonging.
“‘Harry Potter’ is family,” Marletto says. “We see each other here and we pick up like we never left off. It makes you feel like when you’re not home, you still have a home.”
This attitude seems consistent among other attendees. A group of women in their early twenties agree that Harry Potter remains a constant presence in their life via fanfiction and each other.
“‘Harry Potter’ is part of my friends circle, part of my personality, part of my morals and values,” says one of the women, Rebecca J. Dixon. To wit, the trio agreed that if they were to go out and get drunk together, they’d talk about nothing but the Boy Who Lived.
“I’ve been a fan since I was six years old,” Olivia G. Osterberg adds. “Without ‘Harry Potter’ I don’t know who I’d be.”

Harvard’s history is cluttered with ghost stories. Take William James ’69, the namesake of the building that houses Harvard’s Psychology department and the very man who laid that department’s foundations. James was enraptured by the paranormal.
William James is best known for his writings on philosophy and psychology, which frequently appear on the syllabi of Harvard courses. Yet his passion for psychical phenomena — occurrences and abilities that seemingly transcend the explanatory power of natural laws — is less widely acknowledged.
James was committed to the supernatural over the course of his academic career. He co-founded the American Society for Psychical Research in 1885; defended the Society against its many critics; and promoted compelling data on mediumship, telepathy, “extra-consciousness,” and apparitions, some of which he collected himself.
While the field of psychical research has largely been subsumed by progress in its parent field of psychology, traces of its legacy can still be found at Harvard today.
James tragically lost his infant son in 1885, the same year he was appointed as a full professor at Harvard. As he and his wife were grieving, his mother-in-law urged the couple to pay a visit to a Boston-based medium named Leona Piper. She hoped Piper might help the couple connect with the spirit of their son.
Indeed, during their visit, Piper was compelled to write down the name “Herrin” — a name James and his wife identified as bearing a striking resemblance to their late son’s name, “Herman.”
​​​​​​
James co-founded the ASPR that same year, and one of the Society’s main activities was testing those who claimed to have psychic abilities. Though many alleged mediums were debunked as phonies, Piper maintained her credibility.
In an 1886 presidential address to the ASPR, James affirmed Piper’s reputation as a legitimate medium.
“If you wish to upset the law that all crows are black ... it is enough if you prove one single crow to be white. My white crow is Mrs. Piper,” James said.
The activities of the ASPR intrigued Harvard students, and the organization garnered attention from across the University.
An 1888 talk on “Apparitions” from Richard Hodgson, the Society’s secretary, was advertised in The Crimson as time “advantageously spent.”
“[The ASPR] is a society in which the college should be interested because so many of the professors are leading members,” the announcement read. “Among the leading movers in the society the names of Dr. Bowditch, of the Harvard Medical School, Professor Pickering, of the Observatory, Professors Royce and James and Mr. S. N. Scudder, are well-known to most of us.”
Dean of the Medical School Henry P. Bowditch ’61, Director of the Harvard College Observatory Edward C. Pickering ’65, Comparative Anatomy professor Charles S. Minot, and four other College alumni were all founding members of the ASPR who seemingly legitimized the organization.
In 1912, seven years after Hodgson’s death, several affiliates of the ASPR and philanthropists including James’s son — Henry James Jr. — donated money to Harvard and created a named memorial fund that persists today for the study of “mental or physical phenomena the origins or expression of which appears to be independent of the ordinary sensory channels.”
A decade after James’ death in 1910, British psychologist William McDougall came to Harvard to assume the position of Psychology chair.
McDougall had a keen interest in parapsychological phenomena, which was informed by the cultural climate surrounding the aftermath of World War I. The study of spiritualism had grown in popularity as many people grieved the loss of soldiers who fought and died in combat. He was also a noted eugenicist.
In the early 1920s, Scientific American announced a contest for mediums to substantiate their abilities against the test of rigorous investigation, and McDougall was tapped to sit on the panel of judges along with renowned magician Harry Houdini.
One of the mediums nominated for the contest was Cambridge-based psychic Mina “Margery” Crandon, whose husband Le Roi Crandon was class of 1894. Crandon submitted herself to scrutiny by the Scientific American committee, as well as by a group of 10 Harvard-affiliated students and faculty who took an interest in the local celebrity.
The Harvard group held a series of sessions with Crandon over the years, many in Emerson 11. Crandon would strip and drape herself in a woolen garment before entering the seance room, where she purportedly channeled a spirit named “Walter,” The Crimson reported in 1933. Walter allegedly uttered verses, tugged trousers, pulled hair, and made lights flash and fizzle.
Those in the group initially impressed with Crandon were disillusioned when an amateur magician was able to reproduce these phenomena without calling upon any sort of unnatural powers. Thus, the group’s final 1933 account published in Scientific American became a disavowal of her abilities and was titled, “The Case Against Margery.”
​​​​​​
Despite the ultimate repudiation of Crandon’s abilities, the time and resources devoted to studying her were indicative of serious academic interest in mediums and other psychical phenomena at Harvard. It was during this decade-long golden age that McDougall was inspired to found a “new society” for psychical research in Boston.
"A large, albeit select membership in the society is desired from Harvard University," McDougall told The Crimson in March 1925.
McDougall focused his research efforts on telepathy — a popular topic of inquiry in psychical research. In 1923, he surveyed 1,500 Harvard students for their experiences with the phenomenon. The following year, research fellow Gardner Murphy enlisted a number of students for a cross-continental experiment of thought transference.
Despite all this scholarly productivity, spiritualism would swing out of fashion in the 1940s. Behaviorism — a practice of psychology that studies observable input, observable output, and none of the mediating experience that comes in between — supplanted spiritualism.
Psychology professor Steven A. Pinker says that it has long been a “joke” in the department that a wind tunnel effect around the William James Hall building is in fact the “spirit” of James trying to get inside and protest behaviorism.
Psychical research never fully recovered the prestige it once held after behaviorism took hold amongst psychologists.
“Now, the considerations suggesting that it doesn't exist are so strong, that I would say it's a complete waste of time and money to pursue it,” Pinker says.
But others disagree. Parapsychological Association President Dean Radin says recent advances in quantum mechanics — a branch of physics that deals with the strange behavior of particles at the smallest scales — have the potential to refute modern day criticisms of psychical research.
“In [James’s] day, classical physics is the reigning view of the physical world. No one had any idea how you could have things transcend space and time,” Radin says. “Here we are over 100 years later, and our concept of the physical world is built radically different.”
One of these “radically different” ideas is quantum entanglement — a phenomenon in which two particles separated by huge swaths of distance continue to influence each other. Albert Einstein termed it “spooky action at a distance,” and some paranormal researchers have argued that it could serve as a plausible foundation for telepathy and telekinesis.
Pinker, however, does not believe that quantum mechanics has the potential to redeem the field.
“It’s mumbo jumbo,” Pinker says. “They have not spelled out any way in which quantum mechanics could make any difference in terms of what people could be aware of, or what people could cause.”
When the occasional study does support psychical phenomena, Pinker says he thinks it is most likely that researchers employed “fishy statistical considerations.”
But Brenda Dunne — who ran the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab for almost three decades, until it was closed in 2007 — says her lab’s research into psychical phenomena was “rigorous” in its analytic approaches.
“Because we knew that we were under the negative scrutiny, we had to be very, very good and very careful,” Dunne says.
Dunne, who currently serves as the president of the International Consciousness Research Laboratories, says that Princeton was concerned with how the lab’s existence might affect the school's “academic reputation.”
“The university was never particularly supportive of our program. They tolerated it on the basis of freedom of inquiry,” Dunne says. “I think they were rather glad that we ended up closing the place.”
A Princeton spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
Gary E. Schwartz, director of the Laboratory for Advances in Consciousness and Health at the University of Arizona and a former Psychology professor at Harvard, wrote in an email that, within academia, there exists a “climate of professional (and sometimes personal) hostility” for scholars interested in psychical phenomena.
Schwartz adds that skeptical colleagues will only review his methods under conditions of anonymity because they fear “guilt by association.” This “taboo,” he writes, deters young scholars from taking up interest in the field.
Some particularly adventurous students, however, still manage to make space for their unconventional interests in academia. Samuel T. Moulton ’01, for example, pursued research in psychical phenomena all throughout his undergraduate and graduate years at Harvard.
Moulton says he “got lost in the library and went from psychology to parapsychology” during his undergraduate career. He identified former dean of Social Sciences Stephen M. Kosslyn as a mentor, and wrote his undergraduate thesis — which won a Hoopes Prize — on the topic of thought transference.
“I didn't find anything that was terribly compelling. But I thought maybe I just haven't figured out the right way to inspire this stuff to happen,” Moulton says. As a graduate student in Psychology, Moulton continued his research and published a paper in January 2008 that disputed telepathy.
“I never went into it as a true believer, and I'm not someone that thinks this absolutely doesn't exist either,” says Moulton. “I figured out everything I could do about it, and took advantage of this weird, weird opportunity at Harvard.”
Moulton’s research was financed by the Hodgson memorial fund, which he calls “rumored” and unpublicized.
“It was nowhere to be found online,” Moulton says. “I think I got a very tired looking photocopy of these restricted funds.”
Pinker says the fund has an interesting reputation. “Everyone calls it the ‘Spook Fund,’” he says. “And there have long been efforts to use that money for more respectable scientific pursuits without contravening the terms of the gift.”
The chair of Harvard’s Psychology department did not respond to a request for comment.
Despite the unfriendly climate in academia, Schwartz remains undeterred in his quest to connect the living and the dead through the medium of texting on the “Soul Phone” — a prototype that he is developing in his laboratory.
Schwartz writes that, should the “Soul Phone” be a success, he would hope to collaborate with the spirit of James.
“Presuming, of course, that he would choose to collaborate with me,” Schwartz adds.
Indeed, in a 2010 paper published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, Schwartz marshalled evidence from controlled double-blinded studies with two mediums to suggest that “[James’s] interest in continuing this work has not waned since he joined the spirit realm.”
Schwartz calls James his “personal hero” — and on this characterization, at least, Pinker agrees. “‘[James] was an all around genius,” Pinker says. “I have quoted him in almost every one of my books.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Student workers across the University cast the first ballots Tuesday in a historic vote to decide whether Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers' bargaining committee could call for a strike if it sees fit.
Polls for the multi-day strike authorization vote will be open at least until Friday, according to an email from HGSU's bargaining committee to its members. In the meantime, negotiators from Harvard and the union will convene for their 24th bargaining session Thursday.
HGSU — which represents graduate research assistants and student teaching fellows at the University — needs to receive a two-thirds majority of voting members in favor of the strike to be granted the authority to initiate a strike.
Union organizers staffed 11 polling stations across the University's Cambridge and Longwood campuses Tuesday. Polling is set to occur at 10 other locations through the rest of the week.
After casting his ballot in the Science Center Tuesday morning, HGSU bargaining committee member Cory W. McCartan said he believes it is “pretty clear” that the authorization will achieve the two-thirds majority it needs to pass.
McCartan said he hopes for a “strong vote” in support, which will make a strike as “unlikely as possible” because it will send a clear message to Harvard administrators.
“Looking back at all the proposals Harvard has made at the table, and the proposals we've made at the table, it's pretty clear they're not bargaining in good faith at all,” McCartan said. “So it's going to take something to sort of shock them out of that and I think this is the way to do that.”
University spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain referred to previous emailed statements Tuesday that said it is Harvard's position that the strike vote is “unwarranted.”
“The University continues to approach these negotiations in good faith,” Swain has previously written.
A strike, however, will not necessarily be imminent if HGSU's bargaining committee is given the power to call for one.
McCartan said the union will do all it can to avoid a strike, and that he is “hopeful” that the University would respond in negotiations.
“If the strike's authorized, which we expect it will be, we're going to give Harvard as much time as possible to to respond to that,” he said. “I think that the way they've reacted so far demonstrates that they're aware of the gravity of the situation.”
Biological and Biomedical Sciences student Tristan Tay said he voted in support of the authorization to give colleagues in other departments “the option” to call a strike if necessary.
If a strike were called for, however, Tay said he would not participate because he cannot afford interruptions to his research.
“If I strike, I'm really only hurting myself,” Tay said. “Even though I'm not willing to strike personally, I'm still willing to authorize the strike, so that those people who want to can, and so that the union will have more bargaining power.”
Jenna M. Kaufmann, a graduate student in the Math department, said she was initially unsure about the strike authorization vote, but after speaking with other union members, decided to affirm it.
“I hope it won't come to that,” she said. “I do think that it's good for the union to have more leverage in its negotiations.”
Kaufmann added that she trusts the bargaining committee to use the threat of a strike “intelligently” to further its goals for the new contract.
Canaan R. Morse — an East Asian Languages and Civilizations graduate student who voted “yes” to the strike vote — said that though it would be “very, very painful” economically to go on strike, he would still do it if the bargaining committee calls for one.
“Sometimes reasonable people are forced to do things that they don't want to do,” Morse said.
Voting eligibility in the strike vote is relatively wide compared to those who were allowed to vote in the initial unionization election. In addition to student workers currently in the union's bargaining unit, students employed by the University last year or who expect to be employed by the University for research or teaching because of their degree programs are also eligible to vote.
McCartan said the bargaining committee will make a determination after voting closes for the day on Friday whether to extend the vote additional days to allow more people to cast ballots.
“The Bargaining Committee is going to sort of evaluate how things are going and make sure ... that everyone had a chance to vote,” he said.
The University and the union — now entering their second year of contract negotiations — have reached eight tentative contract agreements, but remain at loggerheads over several contentious topics. Sexual misconduct and discrimination grievance procedure proposals remain unresolved, as do those regarding economic issues – such as compensation and healthcare.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Dean of Arts and Humanities Robin E. Kelsey held a town hall Tuesday to discuss inclusion and belonging, and update division affiliates on the investigation into a “hateful” message delivered to a Harvard faculty member last month.
The event — which drew roughly 40 professors, graduate students, and undergraduates — came roughly two weeks after a faculty member received a note posted on her office door that insulted her ethnicity and immigration status and questioned her place at Harvard. The faculty member was with several graduate students when she saw the posting, which also wished her ill.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Claudine Gay and University President Lawrence S. Bacow sent an email about the incident to University affiliates the next day on Sept. 27, writing that they “unequivocally” condemn it. They also wrote that they would not be providing additional information about the incident out of concern for the faculty member’s privacy.
Harvard University Police Department has assigned a detective to the case, Kelsey told affiliates at the meeting. Kelsey said the detective told him similar incidents of hate speech have happened before at Harvard.
Kelsey said the incident and the town hall should serve as a starting point for discussions about diversity in the Arts and Humanities more broadly.
“I'd really rather use it as a springboard to talk generally about the issues of inclusion and belonging within the division of Arts and Humanities, but if people feel some particular issues or concerns arising out of that incident, I'm happy to address them in the broad sense of addressing a really horrible instance,” he said.
Several attendees asked Kelsey and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Dean for Academic Programs and Diversity Sheila Thomas — who co-led the town hall — whether students and faculty members of color should be worried for their safety after the incident last month. Kelsey and Thomas said in response that they would like to see the University implement a formal procedure for investigating allegations of racial bias.
Attendees at the event made a variety of suggestions to make Harvard more inclusive, including increasing the number of gender-neutral bathrooms in the Barker Center and ensuring students are aware of implicit biases that may affect instructor evaluations.
Discussing the latter, creative writing professor Teju Cole said the University needs to reshape students’ image of what a professor looks like.
“It might be appropriate not to assume that people have some kind of like natural ability to assess how they're taught, that there might be some kind of training, some sensitivity training of some kind, to help people understand that society has taught us that genius looks like a white man,” Cole said.
The discussion took place in the Barker Center’s Thompson Room. Several attendees noted that the room is lined with portraits of white men, which Kelsey suggested may change during forthcoming renovations. Kelsey added that he is committed to academic inclusion, and that he hopes his term as dean will be measured by the strides his division makes in becoming more diverse.
“The quality of our intellectual exchange and the work that we do is going to be directly related to the extent to which all members of our community feel included, feel like they belong to this division, this school, and this University,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Former Finance Minister of Nigeria Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke about solutions to global poverty at the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School Tuesday.
Okonjo-Iweala — who currently serves as chair of the board for Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization — initially focused her talk on several issues that are prevalent across Africa. Utilizing visuals from the Brookings Institute’s World Poverty Clock, Okonjo-Iweala said that “Africa is not converging fast enough.”
Along with raising specific concerns about Africa’s relatively high poverty and corruption levels, Okonjo-Iweala also highlighted potential solutions, saying she hopes Africa can “change the face of poverty and surprise the world.” She pointed to some African countries, such as Ethiopia and Rwanda, as case studies for other African nations to grow their economies.
“The question we should ask is what are those countries doing right. I am not saying they are doing everything right, but they are doing very many things right,” she said.
After her talk, Okonjo-Iweala fielded questions from audience members about the role of corruption in African poverty and argued that the term “corruption” should be disassociated with “Africa.”
“Of course there is corruption on the continent, so I am not trying to get away from that,” Okonjo-Iweala said. “But I don’t like that whenever you mention Africa, the next word is corruption.”
“We can’t characterize Africa with corruption,” she added.
Many students who attended the event said they appreciated Okonjo-Iweala’s insistence on separating connotations of corruption from Africa’s global image.
“I think I found it particularly insightful to listen to all of her comments, systematically refuting the ways in which Western literature or policy analysts choose to talk about Africa,” Aaryan G. Morrison ’22 said.
Dumebi M. Adigwe ’23 said the point about addressing the way ‘corruption’ is associated with Africa especially resonated with her, as it is something she discusses with her family.
“I think what she said was very important, that whenever you talk about Africa the next word is corruption,” Adigwe said. “I’m Nigerian, and we do that all the time [in my family] and I think it’s time to stop shifting blame and doing what she said and seeing what you can do to help.”

Economics Professor Michael Kremer ’85 had just finished riding his bike to the London School of Economics Monday morning when he saw a message on Skype, asking to talk “urgently.”
Assuming it was a scam message, Kremer said he began to respond but was interrupted by someone congratulating him.
“For what?” he asked.
Earlier that day, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences had awarded Kremer — along with MIT Economics Professors Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo — the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences.
The award recognized the trio’s “experimental approach to alleviating global poverty,” according to a press release from the academy.
“In just two decades, their new experiment-based approach has transformed development economics, which is now a flourishing field of research,” the academy wrote. “The Laureates’ research findings – and those of the researchers following in their footsteps – have dramatically improved our ability to fight poverty in practice.”
Kremer’s research consists of conducting experiments to explore the root causes of poverty in developing countries, according to the press release. He frequently works with government agencies and nonprofit organizations to develop innovative policies in fields such as education, healthcare, and microfinance.
Kremer said the award served as a nod of recognition to everyone doing research in the field of development economics.
“The field of development economics has really undergone tremendous growth in the past few decades,” he said. “We’re bringing in a lot of perspectives not to replace but to complement the standard analytic approaches that economists have.”
Kremer received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1992 and served on MIT's for six years before returning to Harvard as a professor. He is also a MacArthur Fellow and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Economics Professor Oliver Hart, who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, said the work of this year’s recipients has made significant impacts on both academic economics research and policy.
“They’ve transformed development economics by moving in this direction of carrying out controlled experiments at the local level and trying to find out what treatments work, both with respect to education and with respect to health,” Hart said. “People have learned what works and what doesn’t, and that has allowed policymakers to do things which make people better off.
Economics Department Chair Jeremy Stein added that the trio pioneered a “revolution in the way people do development economics.”
Stein also noted that this year’s laureates were particularly young. At 46, Duflo is the youngest person to receive this honor and the second woman ever.
“Typically with economics, they tend to wait till people are really quite old, and this is a younger group,” Stein said. “They’re not only recognizing the work, but they’re recognizing that the work has already had such a big impact that there’s no reason to wait any longer.”
“I think it’s just terrific,” Stein added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a Harvard Law School event last week featuring a lawyer representing anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions in its lawsuit against Harvard, several students engaged in debate over comments about discrimination against Asian American students made during the event.
Last Tuesday, the Law School’s Federalist Society and Native American Law Students Association co-hosted an event featuring Adam K. Mortara, SFFA’s lead attorney in its lawsuit alleging that Harvard College discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions practices.
At the event, Mortara challenged Federal Judge Allison D. Burroughs’s acceptance of discrepanies in personal ratings between Asian American students and those of students from other racial background as insufficient evidence of discrimination.
"No one — not Judge Burroughs, not Harvard — has ever explained how it is that African Americans and Hispanics just have much better objective personal qualities than white and Asian applicants,” he said.
“I guess there's just something more personally appealing about African American and Hispanic applicants,” Mortara quipped. In response, at least a dozen students in the crowd voiced their opinions and shouted back, “There is!”
Following the event, some students said they felt that their concerns about discrimination against Asian American students on campus were invalidated. Board members from the Asian Pacific American Law Students Association sent an email about the event to their members, acknowledging that the comments at Mortara’s talk “disturbed” some students.
“To those of you who were hurt by this or who spoke up about this, you are not alone. Vocalizing feelings of discomfort in a public forum takes courage. Doing so in an environment with complex histories and strong tensions is difficult. We thank you for standing up for our community and each other,” APALSA wrote.
Separately, students debated the remarks in internal chats.
Paul Caintic, a student who attended the event, wrote in a group chat with students from the Law School’s sixth 1L section that he felt students laughing in response to Morata’s comment was racist. The Law School divides its first-year students into several sections within which they take classes together.
“Today, a group of students announced that I had an objectively worse personality than them because of my race,” he wrote in a portion of the group chat exchange reviewed by The Crimson. “They laughed about it. Call it what you want. I call it racism.”
Caintic said in an interview that he recalled growing emotional when he heard students laugh at Mortara’s comment.
“I remember sitting there just sort of just sort of tearing up,” Caintic said.
Caintic’s message sparked a tense exchange between several students discussing whether the Tuesday event incident was racist or not.
Law School student Naneka Bakare wrote in the group chat that the event caused unproductive infighting among students of color.
“Today a group of students had a lunch talk about why black and brown students don’t deserve to be admitted to Harvard,” Bakare wrote. “Call it what you want. I call it racism. The point is there shouldn’t be infighting among POC when the real issue is systematic racism against all POC.”
Bakare did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Following Bakare’s message, Caintic left the group message.
“I don't think that the people in the group chat, who were talking, necessarily had, like, malice in their hearts in replying to me, but what I would say is that it felt as if they were trying to minimize what had happened in that room and the remarks that were made and the insinuation that Asian Americans have objectively worse personalities than African Americans,” Caintic said.
Law student Erica Taicz Blandón wrote in her response to the conversation thread that it is unfortunate to hear that people affirmed the statements about Asian American students, but that black people could not be racist.
“Also hey hey ho ho, Black people can’t be racist, let’s not imply that here. Racism is so powerful because it involves *deeply* entrenched *systemic* imbalances which benefit and empower the person who acts individually,” she wrote in the group chat. “I’m truly sorry to hear that anyone was directly or indirectly saying that Asian Americans have worse personalities, that is unacceptable.”
Blandón wrote in an email to The Crimson — similar to other statements in the group chat — that she condemns the Federalist Society’s role in hosting the event.
The Federalist Society did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Another student in the group chat, Sarah Rutherford, replied to the growing thread that she had booked a room for students to discuss the issue in person.
“Just want to take a moment to thank those who were courageous enough to share their thoughts and educate us yesterday,” Rutherford wrote. “If you’re anything like me and you don’t always know what to say in these conversations, try listening.”
Rutherford wrote in an email to The Crimson that she wanted to bring her classmates together because the debate had “such an incendiary impact on us.”The group chat debate, however, was not the only conversation at the Law School about the forum incident.
APALSA Co-President Maylynn Chen said that the organization is planning programming with other Law School affinity groups focused on open dialogue in coming weeks.
“I think we can all say that, the ensuing discussion about the issue overall and about the event in particular has been very productive,” Chen said. “We’ve seen and heard about a lot of engagement from our members and from the larger community. We’ve engaged in conversations with other affinity groups on the HLS campus.”

As 12 presidential candidates battled on stage during the fourth Democratic primary debate Tuesday night, dozens of Harvard affiliates cheered along in the John F. Kennedy Jr. Forum.
Harvard students, staff, and faculty — many donning shirts indicating the candidates they supported — attended the three-hour watch event, hosted by the Institute of Politics. Several student campaign groups were also present, sitting at separate tables dedicated to the different candidates they support including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg.
The attendees watched as the candidates — including frontrunners Joe Biden, Warren, and Sanders — debated on stage in Westerville, Ohio. The candidates discussed a range of topics, including the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, healthcare, income inequality, and gun control.
Esmail Fadae, a software engineer at Harvard Business School, said he frequently attends debate watch parties because he enjoys seeing how others react.
“You get the crowd reactions from people [and] hear what gets applause,” Fadae said. “It’s one way to get a sense of what other people are interested in and what they are passionate about without necessarily having those conversations.”
Though there were designated tables at the event for many of the frontrunners, a table for Biden was missing. A Monday poll by Quinnipiac University shows Biden polling in second place at 27 percent, behind Warren.
When asked about the absence, Harvard for Biden member Diego A. Garcia ’20, said he does not believe it indicates a lack of support for Biden among Harvard affiliates.
As the debate wore on, the issues of gun violence and income inequality proved to be particularly salient among the crowd.
One of the largest applauses of the night came when former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro said, “Police violence is also gun violence.”
Warren’s answers about cutting down the number of billionaires in the U.S. were also met with applause from Harvard affiliates. Throughout the debate, other candidates maintained a more aggressive stance toward her as a result of her rise in the polls.
Many event attendees said that they were decided beforehand and that the debate did not impact their position. Several people departed the watch party halfway through the event, leaving the auditorium half-empty long before the debate ended.
“I don’t think debates are always the most productive forum for doing that but they do give us a chance to think about issues that really matter,” Natalie I. Swartz ’20 said.
Several people said they did not find the debate helpful due to the number of candidates on stage. Tuesday’s event marked the largest debate yet; the past three Democratic presidential debates had at most 10 candidates on the stage at a time.
“Klobuchar, Booker — are they polling well enough to, do they have a real chance?” Fadae said. “Or are they just drowning out discussions that people need to hear from the candidates who are the frontrunners and who still have a solid chance at placing?”
Though the debate grew heated at times, candidates repeatedly stressed the need to unite against President Donald Trump’s chance of winning a second term — a sentiment some debate viewers shared.
“Any of these candidates would serve our country better than our current president,” Swartz said.

 For any fans that took to the seats of Harvard Stadium last weekend, history seemed to repeat itself – the Crimson slaughtered its opponents for the third time in a row, the squad added yet another punt block to its season total, and the ratio of exposed concrete seating to real-life fans was, yet again, about three-to-one.
However, any pertinent observers of Harvard’s weekly halftime show may have noticed one glaring difference: the size of the band. Instead of barely containing enough members to spell out the word “win,” last weekend’s musical performance was ridden with trombonists and tuba players, the band’s ranks swelling to take up an entire 40 yards of field (a much-needed victory for the 10,000 Men of Harvard after being dominated by Howard’s musical mastery). The reason: Old Timers’ Day! This past weekend marked the 100th anniversary of the Harvard University Band, a feat that warranted the attendance of many a former member (and for $350 a ticket, you too could’ve joined!).
This whole anniversary thing got me thinking – just how different from today’s contests were the games watched by the Harvard band of a century ago? Well, folks, buckle your seatbelts and settle into The Harvard Time Machine, because it’s time to take a trip into The Crimson archives!
October 20, 1919: Outcheered and Outsung
Yikes. That headline says it all.
“Indifferent cheering and poor singing marked the University's effort to support its team against Brown last Saturday,” the article reads. “When the University singing is so weak it cannot be heard above the band on the other side of the Stadium there is shown a deplorable lack of energy throughout the crowd.”
Apparently, as the men of Harvard cheered on the Grand Olde U-S-of-A in its battle to take down the Second Reich, they failed to applaud their classmates on the field in their quest to end the reign of the Bears. The good news is that the Crimson’s cheerers – or lack thereof – had little effect on the game’s outcome, as Harvard went on to win the contest, scoring a single touchdown to the Bears’ nilch.
However, that article – as cheeky as it may have been – was hardly the most audacious of the day. Also in the paper for October 20th was a Prohibition Era-letter to the editor concerning alcohol use on campus, praising the fact that “the Demon Alcohol has been completely annihilated in our country” and claiming that “only the luxury of nicotine (and a few other things) need yet to be eliminated.” Whether the opinion piece was sarcastic or serious is a question that I’ll leave to you.
My personal favorite from that day’s paper: a call for “nominations for members of the Dining Hall Council for 1919-1920.” But James, what is the Dining Hall Council? I’ve certainly never heard of that! Well, reader, neither had I – but upon further inspection, it turns out that Harvard used to have literal groups of representatives, each dining hall-specific, that were in charge of “general supervision and control of the [dining] halls and the adjustment of any claims.” I’m not exactly sure why the University hasn’t taken steps to bring these councils back (I’ve seen many a fight break out over Red’s Best Catch), but I’d be curious to see how they would’ve reacted to the idea of food-bearing robots wandering around Harvard’s campus.
October 14, 1969: Harvard Muffles Lions Roar, 51-0
Getting back to football and jumping a full fifty years forward, our fans seem to be doing a bit better (I’d take muffling to being outcheered any gameday). A half-century after just slightly outpacing the Bears, Harvard completely annihilated the Columbia Lions in a “one-sided romp,” even “putting in the second, third and fourth string teams to keep things charitable” – sound familiar?
But the déjà vu continues! As it turns out, 2019 isn’t the Crimson’s first Year of the Smith – its 1969 offense, led by one Dave Smith (relation to Jake unknown), dominated the Lions on the passing front, launching bomb after bomb to crush Columbia. However, let’s hope the similarities stop there, as Harvard went on to place 6th in the Ivy League that season, winning a lousy two games over the course of the year.
Some other notable articles from that day’s paper: Student Investigation of Pentagon Finds That Information Is Hidden (what no way!), Med Schools Protest War, Mail Postcards to Nixon (Divest take note), and The Vagabond: I Am In Mather House; Nobody Loves Me (some things never change).
My favorite line comes from the last of the three, when two Eliot House sophomores were asked to house a Mather resident for a few weeks. Instead of taking the house-less kid in (Mather was under construction at the time), they responded by “taking off their clothes, throwing rotten fruit, and chanting in unison that if the House tried to give them a floater they'd drive him to University Health services within 48 hours.” Sounds about right – except today, the whole HUHS thing might be an issue.
Welp, that’s history for you – 100 years from now, let’s hope that we look back at Harvard’s past a little more nostalgically. And who knows: maybe Harvard Stadium will have a few more fans in its seats by then!

 The Harvard women’s rugby team firmly defeated Notre Dame this past Saturday, finishing with a final score of 105-0. After defeating Dartmouth and Quinnipiac the past two weekends, this dominant win over the Falcons extends the Crimson’s winning streak to three games. The victory also marks the first time since Sept. 22, 2017 that Harvard has scored over 100 points, when the team beat Mt. St. Mary’s, 130-0.
Harvard (3-1, 1-0 in Ivy League) demonstrated its dominance early over Notre Dame College (0-3) and did not look back. Sophomore Emma Kearney scored the first try of the game in the opening minutes and the Crimson steadily continued to rack up points, leading 57-0 at halftime. Harvard continued to thrive in the second half as its next 48 points came in rapid succession. Junior Milan Roberts scored her first try of the season, just 20 seconds into the second half and Sophomore Sofie Fella mixed herself into the exciting action by contributing another try less than two minutes later.
“Everyone got on the field and everyone played really strongly,” said senior Captain Robyn Beese. “We just did a really good job of exploiting open space and working really well as a team, rather than individual players.”
Though the cold and windy weather created a difficult environment to play in, the Crimson persevered and maintained control of the game.
“There were definitely some moments where it was easy to get frustrated. We kind of had some dropped balls and little errors,” said Roberts. “But we were able to fix these errors throughout the game and just remain level-headed.”
Each player greatly contributed to help bring the team to a resounding victory. Twelve different players scored for Harvard, four of whom had a game high two tries. Roberts led the team with 20 points on two tries and five conversions and junior Erin Wright had her first try of the season.
A huge part of Harvard’s game plan was to give bench players a lot of playing time.
“What was really exciting was that we were able to get a lot of our reserves in and the level of play remained the same throughout the game,” said Roberts. “That was definitely a highlight for the team as we were really able to develop the team and see everyone play today.”
Harvard’s team contains eight first years, a program record, two of whom scored tries against Notre Dame. First-year Alex Pipkin scored her first career try in the first half to extend the Crimson’s lead to 45-0. First-year Brogan Mior, the team’s current point leader for the season, touched down for her first try of the game in the second half to bring the score to 77-0.
The team successfully worked as a unit, turning lengthy possessions into successful scores.
“We had a few really good continuous plays. We would have a set piece, then we would have a scrum, and finally we would have numerous phases off of that which would often eventually lead to a try,” said Beese. “This was definitely just a really good game to use as momentum going into the next few weeks.”
Harvard looks to continue this dominance in their final regular season game, which will take place at Brown on Saturday, Oct. 19 at 11 am. The Crimson will also host this year’s Ivy League championship against Dartmouth on Saturday, Oct. 26 at 11 am.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year’s college athletics news cycle has been absolutely dominated by the recent slew of admissions scandals revolving around athlete recruiting. In case you have missed all of that, huge law enforcement stings have caught wealthy parents paying for their children to be recruited as athletes to universities of varying academic pedigrees in order to secure admissions. These developments have launched the college admissions process into the national spotlight once again, with various news shows and cable channels focusing on the scandals. Many prestigious schools have felt the black mark of these scandals, having to deal with the mess that has been this process.
This Tuesday, Felicity Huffman started her prison sentence for her role in the college admissions scandal. Huffman is a famous award-winning actress best known for her role on “Desperate Housewives.” She paid to doctor her daughter’s standardized test scores and was subsequently caught and charged for this crime. The celebrity was sentenced to only 14 days in prison.
Why do I bring up the scandal and Huffman? I suppose I could use my perch as a journalist to comment on the small prices paid by the rich and famous for their transgressions. I could elaborate on the unfairness of the college admissions process. I could even take a step back and take a look at how the process favors the wealthy and influential. If this is the first time you are reading my column, you might be expecting me to do just that. If it isn’t, then you know where I’m going.
Huffman will serve 14 days in federal prison. When she emerges from her brief stay behind bars, Ivy League football will be fully in conference play. This week is the final set of matchups between Ancient Eight squads and non-conference opponents. We are so excruciatingly close to the full swing of Ivy League play that Felicity Huffman will still be in prison when it starts, and her stay couldn’t be shorter. She should be glad that her name was mentioned in an Ivy League sports article and it has no relation whatsoever to the Yale women’s soccer team.
One more week with non-conference play. We’re almost there, but for now I still have six games to break down.
DARTMOUTH VS. MARIST
The Granite State is on the up-and-up. Yes, you heard me correctly. There’s a buzz in New Hampshire that we usually don’t feel until after the Iowa Caucuses are completed and the small New England state suddenly becomes relatively relevant. For the first time since 1996, both Dartmouth and the University of New Hampshire football teams are ranked, with the Wildcats at number 22 and the Big Green ranked 21. I have a few recently graduated friends up there working for a certain former Vice President Democratic frontrunner candidate, and while they seem to be pretty focused on the recent debate, I can feel the excitement of New Hampshire football successes in their presence.
Dartmouth is definitely feeling the reverberations of success following last week’s contest. The Big Green thoroughly demolished the Ivy League preseason favorite in a 42-10 drubbing of Yale. Last week, I hyped up this game as a huge early season matchup between Ancient Eight favorites that could affect the way the conference shakes out at the conclusion of the season. I even deemed it worthy of a 1:30 P.M. start time as opposed to the commonplace 1:00 P.M. This was not the case. My pick of Dartmouth by four points was not even close, and if I haven’t made it clear enough already, the Big Green Defensive MachineTM is for real. I’ve been hyping up Dartmouth a lot lately, so I’m sure that they won’t let me down this week. I feel like I’m not doing a good job of balancing my reverence for their football program with my relentless attacks on the little town of Hanover.
Dartmouth by 28.
PRINCETON VS. BROWN
It would be unfair to describe this matchup as David versus Goliath. The hefty Goliath, the mightiest of warriors, had no chance to lose his battle with the feeble David. When Goliath fell to little David’s slingshot, the masses were shocked at the loss of the heavy favorite. Somehow, against all odds, the young shepherd defeated the giant. Like I said, this is not the same situation. Brown beating Princeton would not be David defeating Goliath. This would be more comparable to one of David’s mindless sheep somehow dropping the giant.
Every week I participate in an FBS college football betting pool. Each week, we pick three underdogs to cover the spread and hopefully earn us bonus points with an upset victory. A few weeks ago, my friend included Harvard for my sake. He asked why I did not pick Brown to cover the 20.5 point spread against the Crimson. I commented to him that even our local high school we attended could cover three touchdowns on Brown. If I was even remotely correct, Princeton should be able to cover at least triple that.
Princeton by 63.
COLGATE VS. CORNELL
Now this is what I call a regional rivalry. The Upstate Upstarts. The Battle of the Boondocks. The Rural Rivalry. The Countryside Clash. The Farmland Fracas. I’ll stop these insults before I feel the wrath of my close friend and fellow Crimson staff writer Lucy Connor, a proud resident of the extremely, intensely, aggressively upstate New York hamlet of Cazenovia (population 12?).
Luckily for Colgate, the road trip will only be roughly an hour and 45 minutes, which is known in upstate New York as “right down the street.” Adding to the Raiders’ luck, Cornell has lost three straight games. This is about where Colgate’s luck stops. The Raiders are 0-7 on the season, and have lost nine straight going back to last year. We can probably assume that it will be 10 in a row come Saturday.
Cornell by 14.
PENN VS. COLUMBIA
I find it pretty much irresistible to talk about the slightly better known football team located in the City of Brotherly Love when they do something that is totally and utterly a perfect fit for the Eagles. I found a perfect fit when the University of Pennsylvania Dean of Undergraduate Admissions proved he was a true Eagles fan with a very on brand Eagles tirade. This week, the Eagles showed that they were the Eagles when linebacker Zach Brown called out former teammate Kirk Cousins before the latter torched Philly for four touchdowns. To bring an Eagles story full circle, Brown was cut by the Eagles.
Columbia has scored the least amount of points in the Ivy League, and I bet they wish that they were playing the worst secondary located in the city of Philadelphia. But the Eagles will be occupied in Dallas, so instead the Lions get Penn. Fortunately for Columbia, the defense has shown promise to make up for the offense. It held Princeton to 21 points, its lowest total offensive output since its 14 point performance last season against the Big Green Defensive MachineTM. Penn has allowed the most points in the Ancient Eight among actual competing defenses, with its 104 allowed points leading only Brown’s 150. The matchup seems to favor Columbia.
Columbia by 3.
YALE VS. RICHMOND
As previously mentioned in my Dartmouth section, Yale football is not in its best place. The preseason Ivy League favorites were absolutely dismantled not only by the Big Green Defensive MachineTM, but also by Dartmouth’s offense. I have already talked badly enough about the Bulldogs’ performance, and even took a shot at Yale’s role in the college admissions scandal. Only Brown has taken more of a beating from me in today’s article, and by the looks of its defense, they are more than used to taking beatings.
After some digging into Richmond’s student newspaper, I realized that I can relate to their student experience. A recently documented “Battle of the Tacos” reminds me of Harvard’s classic burrito debate between Jefe’s and Felipe’s. Maybe it’s the same, maybe one is way better, like Jefe’s is here. In this game, I’m guessing Yale will be the Jefe’s and Richmond will be the Felipe’s.
Yale by 7.
HARVARD VS. HOLY CROSS
Harvard’s offense is absolutely rolling. The Crimson have scored an Ancient Eight-leading 162 points in its first four contests, averaging an absurd 40.5 points per game. This is a Holy Cross defense that allowed 31 points to Brown’s offense. Yes, I had to go after the low-hanging fruit once again. At this point, attacking the Bears isn’t even low-hanging fruit. It isn’t even sitting on the ground's surface. It’s basically a carrot.

Harvard is no state school when it comes to sports, but a Harvard football game is still a classic experience: fans roll in, lights come on, and, hopefully, the Crimson crush their opponents. Though not everyone makes these games a regular part of their weekend, it’s worth checking out a game before Harvard-Yale. With football season in full swing, here are some people in the bleachers you’ll definitely run into:
The Superfan
They’re ready before the game even begins. Dressed head to toe in Harvard merch — with a foam hand sign, warpaint, and all — these die-hard fans are walking Coop ads who know that to win, it’s either go big or go home. With stronger lungs than that tuba player marching on the field below, you’ll hear them cheering, whether you like it or not.
The Confused One
Football isn’t that hard to understand. It’s running into each other until the whistle blows, right? Not everyone walks out to the game knowing the rules, but you’ve got to admire this game-goer’s confidence. We don't know why they came, but they’re here. They need help understanding the yard lines, the scoring, and everything in between. You might even hear them cheering for the wrong team. But hey, it’s the thought that counts.
The Social Networker
Cute outfit? Check. Hand on hip, head slightly tilted, and a big smile, this person came to the game and their Instagram followers are going to hear about it. They’ve got more friends than you can count, and heck, they even know kids from the other team. If they’re in your way, you’ll just have to deal with it. There’s no rule against being too friendly, and they’re just here for a good time.
The Bored Buddy
If you ask this person what the best part of a game is, they’ll tell you it’s the pretzels. They’re begging to leave before it even it starts, and we know they’re only in the bleachers because a couple of friends dragged them along. They complain about how boring the game is, but you can’t really blame the game when they’re in the bathroom — for the 6th time — when Harvard finally scores.
The Hardcore Analyst
To some people, football isn’t just a game: it’s scientific research. They know the stats, they know the players, and they know all the plays. You’ll get the minute-by-minute commentary whether you asked for it or not. They’re low-key flexing on you. But you just let ‘em.

If you and your friends have already made it to a game this season, we hope you had a great time. If you missed it, no worries — there’s plenty more to come this fall. Don’t forget to check out the athletic calendar for ticket pre-sales, and GO CRIMSON!
