After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This week on “Big Little Lies”: Renata and Madeline start a full-on feud, Jane continues to hoard secrets, Ed and Nathan face off on behalf of their wives, and Celeste and Perry have some really twisted sex. Also, more glossy, green-blue shots of hills and sea. All this pretty scenery, Kindergarten drama, and seriously desperate housewifery serves as an effectively entertaining continuation of the pilot, for the most part. However, “Serious Mothering” also demonstrates a few new flashes of tantalizing, surprising ambition—and maybe even real innovation.
The surprises begin as the episode takes a sharp turn away from the mystery outlined in episode one. “Somebody’s Dead” sets up a classic murder mystery—a corpse turns up in the bushes at a PTA party—and then stops short of identifying the victim before the end of the episode. By the logic of most shows, then, episode two would begin with the revelation of the corpse’s identity and then get moving in typical police procedural fashion. (Clues! Suspects! DNA samples!) In episode two, though, the mystery disappears almost entirely. We still have no idea who the victim is, and it seems unlikely that we’ll find out soon. It’s an ambitious writing choice: The procedural genre provides a lot of standardized structure, and moving outside those boundaries could result in either intriguing renovations of the format or unorganized, loopy chaos. We’ll need more episodes to tell the difference.
As for the central women of the show, Jane’s plotline remains the weakest of the three. It’s fairly obvious what secret she’s concealing—the image of a ripped party dress and carried heels has to be one of the oldest clichés in the book—and Shailene Woodley does little to animate her character otherwise. The plot thread about Madeline’s midlife crisis continues to rely heavily on tropes as well, but something interesting starts to happen in “Serious Mothering”: the actors find reality and genuine emotion right in the middle of all the cliché. Ed’s sorrow about being a consolation prize rings true, and Reese Witherspoon makes Madeline’s distress over losing her children to adulthood seem intensely familiar and painful. Actually, her acting work here looks a lot like her work in “Legally Blond.” In her takes on both Elle Woods and Madeline, Witherspoon manages to embrace and animate caricatures rather than try to act around and apologize for the cliché inherent to each role.
Kidman, however, makes every other actor on the show look like a talentless hack. Her plotline with Alexander Skaarsgard’s Perry takes a sharp turn for the dark and disturbing, and she imbues Celeste with an intensely multifaceted reaction to it—her character seems to be feeling desperation, fear, anger, arousal, sadness, optimism, and uncertainty all at the same time. This complexity helps to elevate the storyline above everything else in the show in terms of energy and intricacy. In fact, Celeste’s entire relationship with Perry might even be emerging as one of the more nuanced portrayals of domestic violence in recent memory: Contrary to the usual narrative, Celeste isn’t just weak or trapped or even necessarily in denial, and Perry isn’t exactly demonic. The writers also uncover the immensely complicated role that sex plays in the abuse, making the daring suggestion that sexual intensity and desire operate on both sides of the couple (albeit in different ways).
All of this originality and dark sexual energy acts as a pointed response to a culture that’s still producing “Fifty Shades of Grey” movies—a franchise that casts violently abusive sex as cozily hot, simple in terms of consent, and a precursor to vanilla domestic perfection. Through Celeste and Perry, though, “Big Little Lies” rejects the idea that sex and consent are easy matters of horniness, that violence in the context of it has everything to do with luxury and goofy props—and turns instead to heated, uneasy waves of desire and love and fury and gender and money and shame. That’s some pretty big game for an eight-episode T.V. show, and we’ll see in the weeks ahead if they’re able to finish as well as they’ve started.

Mohsin Hamid weaves a powerful and relevant narrative in “Exit West.” It claims fame as a “Most Anticipated Book” by Buzzfeed, Time, and the Washington Post, a well-deserved title. Amidst their unnamed country’s political turmoil, the main characters Nadia and Saeed find each other and fall into deep, complicated love. As militants take over their city and bombs destroy houses, the two lovers try to understand the nuances of their relationship. Soon they begin to hear whispered rumors of doors that lead to faraway cities heavily guarded by officers. This initially seems too good to be true, but Nadia and Saeed decide to try their luck and escape. Thus begins their travel, continually westward, to find a new home.
Hamid creates a plot relevant to today’s global issues, yet many seemingly important details are left out. Although the discussion of immigration, refugees, faith, and the constant fighting between “natives and migrants” imply controversial subjects, the language of “Exit West” keeps the novel from being about a specific crisis. Hamid never clarifies which country his characters are originally from or what religion they practice or what language they speak. Although certain practices—such as prayers throughout the day and women wearing robes—seem to imply that the two are Muslim, this is not explicitly stated. This ambiguity might make it hard to contextualize the deeper messages of a novel about race and religion, but it actually makes it more applicable. This vagueness also sheds light on a particular refugee experience, while suppressing any prejudices a reader may have that could influence their ability to sympathize with those who must flee their homes. Its obscurity allows this text to be read in many different ways, depending on what global issue it is being compared to.
The writing style Hamid employs is brilliant. He deals with complicated themes—such as attempting to feel at home in a foreign country while knowing that returning to your homeland is not an option—yet uses simple and approachable language to do so: “He knew how little it took to make a man into meat: the wrong blow, the wrong gunshot, the wrong flick of a blade, turn of a car, presence of a microorganism in a handshake, a cough. He was aware that alone a person is almost nothing.” While he fleshes out his ideas, Hamid makes sure not to lose his reader with convoluted sentences. Throughout the novel, there is a striking juxtaposition between the beautiful and the horrid. In one moment, Hamid describes the love Saeed feels as he looks at Nadia, and in the next he illustrates her neighbor’s brutal death.
Hamid delivers his poignant messages in beautiful but concise ways. Often the entire sentiment of a chapter can be summed up in one sentence. As Saeed and Nadia leave the country they have grown up in, they struggle to say their final goodbyes. The deep sorrow is not fully expressed until the thought-provoking line, “for when we migrate, we murder from our lives those we leave behind.”
The use of doors gives the narrative a surreal quality and artistic style. Although clearly not realistic, the use of doors as a means of transportation to cities across the globe is within the realm of the possible for the characters of the novel. The doors create conflict by facilitating immigration. As large waves of immigrants of all sorts of nationalities flood into cities like London, problems arise when the “natives” feel hostile. Although a great plot device, the doors also serve to give the book an imaginative flair, adding a unreal essence quality to a situation grounded in reality. Saeed and Nadia’s ability to traverse the globe gives the novel many different beautiful backdrops as the two lovers try to understand themselves and each other away from their homeland.
The succinct style with which Hamid writes and his poignant messages allow “Exit West” to live up to the hype surrounding its release. By balancing the surreality of the doors with the ambiguity surrounding the characters’ identity, Hamid paints a picture of a refugee experience that could reflect those of many immigrants today.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
President Trump has changed the face of the fight against climate change. He has appointed Scott Pruitt to lead the EPA. He has pledged to repeal the Climate Action Plan. He has threatened to remove the United States from the COP21 Paris Agreement. He has dismissed scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. All of these actions have something in common: they signal the arrival of a federal government committed to ignorance in the face of science and recklessness in the face of an impending climate disaster. As the Trump administration stakes out a new national stance toward climate change, Harvard must shift its own stance in response. Now, more than ever, it is imperative for Harvard to end its financial support of the fossil fuel industry.
To continue the status quo is a problematic endorsement of business as usual in an environment where facts and science are increasingly characterized as political. Harvard no longer has the luxury of taking an apolitical position and the University’s refusal to take a “political stance” is in itself a political statement about the acceptability of science denial. Therefore, we ask that Harvard take a first step towards accountability. In this first semester of Mr. Trump’s presidency, we demand that Harvard divest from coal and publicly promise to never invest in the industry again.
We present this plea in light of Mr. Trump’s steps to revive the industry. Coal, with its innumerable health hazards, is the most dangerous form of dirty energy. It is also the bedrock of the president’s climate agenda. Ignoring the human suffering and environmental degradation caused by the industry, Trump, along with his cabinet appointees and the EPA transition team, have highlighted coal as a fuel of particular interest.
Just last month, the President dissolved regulations to safeguard waterways from coal mining waste. His cabinet appointees only promise more of the same action. With former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson confirmed as Secretary of State and Rick Perry―whose hopes are to to unleash “hundreds of years in clean coal reserves”―leading as Secretary of Energy, it makes a kind of perverse sense that Scott Pruitt should be Trump’s pick for the EPA. Pruitt, as Oklahoma Attorney General, took the opportunity to bring numerous lawsuits against the environmental agency he now hopes to lead. As recently as last year, the Oklahoman unsuccessfully tried to sue the EPA to prevent regulation of mercury production from coal plants. There’s no question that now the stakes have shifted. The question becomes, how can we, as individuals and communities, resist this new administration? In order to resist an administration that has committed to running pipelines through sacred land and to salvage the dirtiest form of energy on earth, we must use all means possible.
By divesting from coal and refusing to profit from a propped-up revival, Harvard can demonstrate leadership in resisting a backward approach to energy in the reality of climate change.
In the past, Harvard has refused to divest on the grounds that using the endowment to exert “political pressure” would not be in line with its mission of research and education.  It has pointed to climate science research and on-campus emissions reductions as a more mission-appropriate means of addressing climate change. But times have changed. Those policymakers who were receptive and responsive to climate research have been thrown out of the window with the arrival of a national government that is openly hostile to the research that Harvard claims is the only appropriate means for action. Climate change denial—and fact-denial more broadly—pervades the White House. With the silencing of scientists’ voices and proliferation of alternative truths it becomes clear: Harvard’s academic mission has become politicized, in spite of itself. Inaction on the question of divestment is no longer proof of impartiality. Rather, inaction is proof of Harvard’s allegiance to a dirty energy agenda.
On February 17, we sent a letter to President Faust, asking for Harvard to vote on the right side of history. We asked for Harvard College to announce their permanent divestment from the coal industry. We asked that President Faust and her administration respond to our letter by Friday, March 10.
We, the members of Divest Harvard, hope that students, faculty, and alumni will lend their voices to pressure Harvard into acting with a conscience. The clock is ticking. We hope you’ll join us.

Harvard Management Company’s new Chief Executive, N. P. Narvekar, who has announced extensive plans to shake up HMC, will receive nearly $6 million per year for the next three years. This news comes amidst a letter from alumni from the Class of 1981 critiquing HMC’s investment strategies. Their concerns included questioning “why a generous salary is somehow insufficient motivation for fund managers,” echoing a letter from Class of 1981 alumni that last year condemned HMC executive compensation practices as ‘excessive.’ Indeed, Narvekar’s compensation package is among the highest for any endowment chief executive.
Although Narvekar’s compensation is generous, his impressive track record and the importance of revitalizing the endowment justify the expense. With an experienced background, including serving as Columbia’s endowment manager since 2002, Narvekar has already catalyzed hopes of coming success with the changes he has undertaken to bring HMC more in line with competitive peer institutions. Furthermore, his willingness to take such drastic moves affirm the lengths and efforts to which he will go in order to bring about positive change in the University’s finances.
Nor is Narvekar’s pay, relative to recent HMC executives, particularly unreasonable. In 2014, HMC’s previous CEO, Stephen Blyth, received $8 million as HMC’s head of public market, while Jane Mendillo received $14 million for the fiscal year 2014 and half of 2015 as CEO. With the urgency of turning around the endowment ever rising, Narvekar’s compensation package indicates some restraint in exponentially increasing executive pay.
Meanwhile, recent events like the graduate school’s cut in admissions for the coming year underscore the key role the endowment’s success plays in school and student life. The extensive loss in endowment value was cited as the key reason behind the cut, along with the decision to fund House renewal projects with debt. This helps to explain Narvekar’s compensation package, which reflects both the Harvard’s need to attain the best students and the gravity of the task at hand.
Questions remain about whether compensation should be tied to performance, as the Class of 1981 alumni suggest. We agree that this way of aligning incentives and goals seems most logical to produce optimal results. Still, delivering an early vote of confidence could bolster morale and help instill a sense of stability at HMC, and Narvekar’s early actions as CEO demonstrate that the lack of performance incentives has not weakened his drive to instill change. In fact, the vote of confidence might allow him to make the adjustments, however radical, that are necessary to turn around HMC. Regardless, in the long run, linking performance with compensation is advisable.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Ruben: During recruiting season, it seems like everyone at this college wants to work for Goldman Sachs. You’ll see people who study economics, history and literature, or government, dressed in business formal wearing the name tag from their recruiting event like a badge. And, if you look hard enough, you might find those who don’t want to go into finance or consulting, so maybe they’ll shun Goldman Sachs in favor of a humble career in medicine, law, academia, or journalism. But I feel so detached from even those people because they feel entitled to a professional career in a way that I frankly just don’t.
Zoe: When I was in middle school, my mom told me I should be a lawyer, because I was so great at arguing with her. I didn’t think much of it; lawyers were the sort of people that showed up on my TV when I was flipping through the channels. They were the actors on Law & Order, the people who never looked like me: typically male, sometimes of color, but never Latina. College was the first time I ever walked on a law school’s campus, the first time I met real-life law school students. Nevertheless, the beautiful rooms of the Law School Library only brought newfound anxiety as I realized I had no clue how to get there, how to eventually make it to a courtroom, defending people who deserve to have their rights protected.
R: Is it surprising that a brown boy—the child of immigrants, the first in his family to go to college—wouldn’t be able to imagine himself in the careers most Harvard students assume are just the next step in their lives? I was never told a professional career was mine for the taking, and even though thousands of mediocre white men apply to doctoral programs every year, I’ll still hesitate when I end up applying. My hesitation is not just a side effect of self-doubt, but rather a reflection of the fact that professional careers are still suffocatingly white. In 2013, only two percent of full-time university faculty were Latino and two percent were Latina. Five percent of medical school graduates in 2015 and only four percent of lawyers in 2010 were Latinx. The professional world reeks of whiteness, and navigating it with my brown skin will feel like scraping against thorns in a rosebush.
Z: I have the dream, but am at a loss as to how to achieve it. No matter how many admissions panels I go to, I can’t help but think of the stories of private LSAT tutors, the coaches who can get you into whichever school you’d like to attend if you give them enough money. I think of how I’ll be diminished to my grade point average and my test scores, and how unlikely it’ll be that those numbers will tell the story of how hard my transition was to Harvard. I wonder if in those lines of my transcript they’ll be able to see the pain I felt when I lost my family home during freshman year or how every break only brought more stress from home that didn’t end when I got back to campus.
R: When I enter the professional world, brandishing my oh-so-fancy Harvard degree for access, I’ll be aware of how where I come from strays from the norm. I may be able to connect with my co-workers if they went to Ivy League institutions, but unless they’ve also felt the weight of being brown at institutions that favor whiteness, that connection can only run so deep. When they’ll talk about following in the footsteps of their parents—or maybe rejecting them by pursuing politics instead of medicine—I’ll smile and nod. I’ll put on the same face I put on now when people ask where my parents went to school or where I dream of working, as if everyone’s vision is tinted with the same entitled glare as theirs.
Z: It doesn’t matter that I spend most days dreaming of how I can change the world one court case at a time, to protect those from my community who have wrongfully been stripped of their rights time and time again. In the end, it still won’t be enough, because I can’t erase the past, can’t suddenly be born into a family where money isn’t an issue. The boxes I checked on my application for Harvard—first-gen, low-income, Latina, the daughter of a single mother—weren’t just identities I pimped out to get here. They are facets of my identity I wear everyday I walk these halls. They travel with me into every classroom, manifest themselves in every exam that I take, and when it comes time for me to apply to law school, to navigate blindly through spaces no one in my family ever has, they will come along with me there too, packaged into the suitcase of disenfranchisement that I embody.
R+Z: When students like us step through Johnston Gate, they’ll bring with them dreams, but tied closely to those dreams are real insecurities that must be addressed. It isn’t enough to have a speckling of resources here and there. It isn’t enough for there to be only one fellowship, with a limited number of recipients, for students of color who want to pursue academia. It isn’t enough for there to be admissions trips to visit Harvard Law School when in the end we, students born of disenfranchised backgrounds, don’t have sufficient resources to place us on equal footing with our more privileged peers.
As an institution that places so much weight on where we will be post-graduation, and the ways we will choose, as alumni, to shape the world, Harvard is committing a disservice by ignoring the reality that not all students feel entitled to make the jump into a world of suits, high heels, social capital, and class. Although it may take more to prepare us than it takes to prepare our more privileged classmates, giving us admission into this environment that worships the professional world requires that the institution support us in our attempts to become working professionals. Our classmates take what they view as theirs, and about it’s time we ask for our share.

“Indeed, the greatest potential for social harm lies in the scarring of so many young people and the reactive, institutional damages that are the direct products of present marijuana laws. If we are to avoid having this harm reach the proportions of a real national disaster within the next decade, we must move to make the social use of marijuana legal.”
-Lester S. Grinspoon, "Marihuana Reconsidered" (1971)
“So. Let’s talk marijuana,” says Michael C. Ranen, Resident Dean of Ivy Yard.
These days, there  is a  lot  to  talk  about.
On November 8, 2016, hundreds of Cambridge residents voted ‘Yes’ on Question 4, the Massachusetts Marijuana Legalization Initiative, and that initiative was approved. While Massachusetts decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana in 2008 and legalized medicinal marijuana in 2012, the 2016 initiative legalized the use of recreational marijuana. This makes Massachusetts one of eight states to do so.
But as long as marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, and as long as Harvard receives federal funding, administrators will prohibit the use and possession of marijuana on campus. As a result, the university isn’t exactly the crime-ridden bastion of pot-smoking depicted in films like “The Social Network­” and “How High.” 
That said, there are plenty of people who use marijuana at Harvard. A yearly poll conducted by The Harvard Crimson reveals that 21.8 percent of students in the Class of 2017 alone have tried marijuana. This number is even higher—24.3 percent—for the Class of 2020.
Despite this common usage of the drug on campus, the legalization of marijuana comes with baggage. After decades of criminalization, a negative social stigma persists. Some Harvard affiliates—professors, administrators, proctors, deans, even students—still clam up when asked what they think about marijuana use on campus.
“I don’t blame them at all. Look, I’m not that excited to be [interviewed] here either,” says Ranen. “It’s really not a large proportion of my job.”
This reluctance to speak about marijuana reveals one crucial fact: At Harvard, marijuana is legal in name but not in practice. While people are free to possess and smoke marijuana around Cambridge, this freedom ends as soon as they walk within Harvard’s gates.
For decades, Harvard has been home to both professors who study marijuana and students who smoke it. Despite its sprawling, 51,000-foot labyrinth of documents covering Harvard’s 400-year history, the Harvard Archives turns up almost empty-handed when it comes to records of these stories.
A search for references to  “marijuana” or “cannabis” within this repository yields a few honorable mentions: miscellaneous anthropological photographs of a marijuana farm in China; a 1970 French film score entitled Cannabis; hundreds of dissertations, books, and papers about the social and medical implications of drug use,  written by Harvard scholars during the past century.
Among these many technical studies, however, there are only a few references to marijuana use among students.
One report, published by University Health Services in the 1966-67 school year, summarizes these results elegantly: “Harvard has received much publicity because of experiments which were conducted here in the early sixties, but the use of hallucinogenic drugs never achieved wide acceptance, in spite of many well-publicized statements to the contrary.” And yes, “hallucinogenic drugs” includes marijuana.
Almost all attempts by past Harvard affiliates to grapple with marijuana use involve conducting medical or psychological research. Paper after paper references topics from the evolution of the cannabis plant to the political ramifications of its legalization. These professors study marijuana as if it were a bug under a microscope, dissecting and scrutinizing it. 
When asked about the legalization of marijuana in Massachusetts, some fall silent.
Ezer Vierba, a professor of Drugs and Minds in the Americas, declined to comment for this story.
Asim I. Khwaja, a professor of political economy and public policy at Harvard Business School, also declined to comment.
Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics and author of a book about black markets,  also declined to speak to us.
But there are exceptions. On Level B of Lamont Library, there is a tiny alcove with a section dedicated to books about marijuana. Most of these books just play into the same motif of Harvard professors studying marijuana from a purely academic perspective, but one stands out: Marihuana Reconsidered, written in 1971 by Lester S. Grinspoon, current Associate Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
Grinspoon tells us that he has dedicated his life to getting up close and personal with marijuana. He recounts the first time he ever used marijuana at a dinner party, hosted by famed astrophysicist Carl E. Sagan, a life-long friend and colleague.
“[Sagan] invited us to his apartment in Cambridge and I was surprised to see that he and his friends were smoking marijuana. And I knew nothing about marijuana—it had never been mentioned in any psychopharmacology course in med school.”
Grinspoon relives the moment. “I said to him, ‘Carl, you mustn’t use it! It’s harmful to you!’ And Carl held it out to me and said, ‘It’s not harmful, not harmful at all. Here, try it! You’ll love it!’”
After getting high for the first time, Grinspoon began to question the negative portrayal of marijuana that pervaded the media of the early 1970s. He spent hours poring over books in the Harvard Medical School library to find at least some—if any—proof that marijuana was harmful. But he just couldn’t. “It was the first marijuana epiphany I ever had. I was 180 percent wrong,” Grinspoon says.
For Grinspoon, marijuana was more than a research interest. “I used to come home from work and have a drink: scotch,” Grinspoon says. “I stopped that as soon as I started to use cannabis. I haven’t had any scotch in all those years.” He thinks that now that marijuana is legalized in the state of Massachusetts, college students will lay off the alcohol, too.
Grinspoon adds that marijuana use correlates with fewer car accidents than alcohol use, and that there has never been a death attributed to cannabis overdose.
“If I were going to advise a college student on whether or not he should use cannabis or alcohol,” Grinspoon says, “and he’s going to use one or the other, whether it’s on campus or anywhere else, I’d much rather see him use cannabis.”
Not everyone shares Grinspoon’s optimism.
Vaughan W. Rees, Director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, specializes in analyzing the dissemination of tobacco among the public. Some of his latest projects involve researching the impacts of  marijuana use.
“We’ve heard a lot of anecdotal reports that people seeking help from marijuana problems had always been turned away from all of the drug and alcohol facilities because marijuana wasn’t considered by people at that point to be a dependence-producing drug,” Rees says. “There is a very specific set of symptoms which comprise of Marijuana Withdrawal Syndrome.”
Rees has seen patients with symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, overwhelming craving for the drug, anxiety, irritability, anger, depression, trouble sleeping, and night sweats, just to name a few. “Marijuana has a lot in common with a lot of other abused drugs,” Rees says.
Courtney S. Blair ’19, who once smoked 2 to 3 times a day, was diagnosed with a disease known as Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome last summer. Though people may have pre-dispositions to the disease, she says an overloaded use of cannabis can activate the symptoms. “Diseases such as this are definitely drawbacks to people who might think that legalization means that weed is just completely okay to use,” Blair says.
Rees suspects that marijuana use may have a negative effect on Harvard students. “There is good evidence that marijuana decreases learning, memory, and attention,” Rees says. “For those who are attempting to accomplish academic pursuits, that can compromise their ability to perform at a high level.”
Beyond its health detriments—or lack thereof, marijuana also catches the eyes of faculty in economics and business. And as much as its impact can fluctuate markets, it can also dent the wallets of Harvard students.
As anyone who’s read N. Gregory Mankiw’s “Principles of Economics” will know, there’s no such thing as a free lunch—or a free smoke. You have to dispense some green to get some green.
There are four cannabis markets, according to  John A. Quelch, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School. “First of all, you have the illegal street price. Secondly, you have the medicinal marijuana price. Then you thirdly, now that we’ve legalized, have the recreational marijuana price. And then fourthly, you will also have (if I can put it this way) the ‘home-grown price’,” Quelch says.
A few years ago, Quelch and colleagues conducted a case study on Colorado’s 2012 legalization of recreational marijuana. It’s almost as if Quelch can look into the future: Based on his Colorado research, he predicts, with astounding detail, how he thinks the marijuana market will change the face of the Cambridge economy.
“In most cases, it’s likely that we would see towns or cities such as Cambridge, which is a relatively large city, start with not one licensee, but start with two or three at the most for a trial period of a year or so, just to explore what the impact is on the local economy,” Quelch says about the possible emergence of new marijuana dispensaries in Cambridge.
Some of that impact will probably play out in the recesses of the Harvard Square businesses that already sell marijuana-related goods.
Blue Moon Smoke Shop is a smoking accessories store about halfway between Harvard and Central Squares. Assistant manager Tyler J. Bouchard estimates that the vast majority of its customers are college students from Harvard and MIT.
“We’ve already seen a huge increase,” Bouchard says. “[Legalization has] actually brought in a whole new age demographic that we’ve never seen in the business.”
In Cambridge, the city council is waiting for the state to enforce regulations before acting. Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern says that however the city decides to act will follow the state’s decisions, which is scheduled to come out by September of 2017 but may be delayed.
Though Cambridge City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone has no problem with recreational dispensaries in Cambridge, he wants to make clear a  distinction between which dispensaries will be for recreational purposes and which are for medicinal purposes.
“People who go to medicinal dispensaries for marijuana want it to be more like the doctor’s office, or perhaps a pharmacy,” Carlone says. “As far as recreational dispensaries - the ones I’ve seen in Colorado, or Amsterdam, for that matter, are a different atmosphere altogether.”
The Cambridge branch of the Boston Smoke Shop, another purveyor of marijuana accessories, contains a plethora of colorful lights, shelves full of trinkets, water pipes, and bongs. The only thing missing is the marijuana itself.
Marc T. Lundgren, Director of Operations of Boston Smoke Shops, says that medical dispensaries will get first dibs on marijuana licenses. “It’s not our end goal to get our hands on those licenses,” Lundgren says. “If we can, we will. But our goal is more to provide the accessories that go along [with] marijuana for the masses. We plan on seeing—and we already do see—an increase in the usage of marijuana.”
Jeffrey A. Miron, Senior Lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Economics and author of more than a dozen papers detailing the fiscal and social benefits of legalizing marijuana in the U.S., disagrees.
“In other states, legalization has not led to huge booms in use,” Miron says.“Legalization doesn’t make more people smoke marijuana. It’s not like that. The people who want to be using it are already doing it.”
Instead, Miron predicts that marijuana legalization in Massachusetts will lead to more responsible procurement and usage. “When you legalize a drug, the usage becomes less unsafe. In Portugal, heroin has been decriminalized de-facto for years now, and we see a better usage now of it,” he says.
For pot-smoking Harvard students on a ramen noodle budget, safety concerns and price changes make all the difference.
Erica, a Harvard undergraduate to whom The Crimson has granted anonymity so she could speak about her encounters with law enforcement, is an avid marijuana user, smoking three to four times everyday.
“The biggest concern that I have with smoking is definitely finances,” she says. “It definitely adds up.”
Blair says that legalization could change where she buys her marijuana. “As for me, price would be the biggest determinant to whether or not I will continue to buy illegally,” Blair says. “There is a huge price from people transporting illegally, and I would rather prefer the safer product from a dispensary. I also see how some people might be turned off by the shadiness of a drug deal in the car.”
Smoke rises. Anyone who lives on the top floor of a dormitory knows that. Ranen, whose office is on the top floor of the Freshman Dean’s Office, knows that, too.
“Marijuana is a problem in a residential community when it becomes a community issue. I think if the odor of marijuana is distinct and powerful and if there is one room smoking marijuana, it really does affect the entire entryway,” says Ranen, who is a former resident tutor in Winthrop House.
On paper, marijuana is still explicitly forbidden on Harvard’s campus. Even though marijuana’s legal status in Massachusetts is now more or less comparable to that of tobacco, Harvard’s Drug and Alcohol policy groups marijuana together with heroin and cocaine.
Garrett O. Fitzgerald, Director of the Office of Alcohol & Other Drug Services, asserts that Harvard will do everything it can to limit student infraction of the federal ban of marijuana.
Rules aside, a total marijuana ban can be difficult to enforce on a campus of hash-hungry undergraduates.
“When you meet the right  people, Harvard has a strong culture of smokers,” Blair says.
Though some students find themselves immersed amongst smokers and made friendships through using marijuana, Jake H. Hummer ’17 recognizes that it doesn’t dominate his social life. “Actually, I would say that most of my friends aren’t smokers,” he says.
As the legal landscape changes, enforcement of the laws surrounding marijuana usage becomes a grey area for students.
One Tuesday last fall, before marijuana was legalized, Erica decided to smoke by the Charles River in full view of the Winthrop construction site. After a few minutes, she saw a Massachusetts State police officer coming down the bank of the river toward her.
“Turns out that he thought I was shooting up heroin because I was leaning over,” she says. “I had $80 worth of weed and a bunch of plastic bags. It looked like distribution so I was really worried.”
After looking through all of her things, however, the officer just went over rules with her, including when marijuana was going to be legalized and how much she could have in her possession.
“And then he let me go. Didn’t even confiscate any of my stuff, didn’t fine me…. He kind of knew it was mine but he wasn’t going to get on my case about it,” Erica says. “But it was definitely illegal and they do make a big show out of it being illegal.”
She describes her experiences with the Harvard University Police Department, on the other hand, as “chill AF.” Last spring, when she was smoking hookah by the river, a HUPD officer pulled up and asked for her ID. She explained to him that she was only smoking tobacco, and he said that if he’d been off-duty he’d have taken a rip.
HUPD spokesperson Steven G. Catalano declined to comment.
Hummer compares the illegality of smoking weed to that of driving past the speed limit. “There’s a margin of breaking the law that everyone feels is a social norm,” Hummer says. “Prior to the legalization of marijuana, I feel that smoking marijuana was within that acceptable level of breaking the law.”
Dean Ranen acknowledges that there is probably more marijuana use on campus than comes to his attention. “I don’t have exact numbers on that. It happens sometimes,” Ranen says. 
As a result, Ranen tries to implement marijuana safety measures. He mentions Harvard Proof, an online module for incoming freshmen that introduces them to the prospect of encountering drugs and alcohol on campus.
“How much did Harvard Proof focus mainly on alcohol, right? Did Harvard Proof talk about drugs and marijuana? A little bit,” Ranen says. “We need to make sure that we’re discussing it and educating our students appropriately.”
Absent an institutionalized marijuana education, Blair thinks that Harvard students are especially vulnerable to skewed depictions of the drug in popular culture. As a result, she feels that marijuana users get a bad rap.
“When some people smell weed on me, they think less of me. I can tell from their looks,” Blair says. She suggests that critics ask themselves a question: “Why do you hate weed?”
On election day, however, a majority of Massachusetts voters chose to legalize recreational marijuana. Perhaps public perception of marijuana is changing.
“I probably wouldn’t have opened up as much if marijuana was not legalized,” Hummer says. “I would’ve liked to, but I think it being legalized for me is at least a symbol that it has become more understood and accepted.”
Erica interprets legalization as a product of a gradual cultural shift towards marijuana appreciation. “Legalization is an indication that the public is accepting more,” she says.
Tynan C. G. Jackson ’19 goes a step further: He thinks last November’s legalization will be the catalyst for a new culturally dominant attitude toward marijuana. “Social stigma is based a lot on what’s legal and what’s not illegal. This [change in the stigma surrounding] weed should occur,” he predicts.
Despite it remaining a federal crime to possess or consume marijuana, Harvard students find ways to keep the flame alive.
Taking out her phone, Erica pulled up a map of Harvard Yard overlaid with orange diamonds to show the prime locations to smoke marijuana on campus. Erica says that she “hit[s] these spots on the daily” and is continually adding new locations.
Harvard may hold back on allowing students to smoke marijuana on campus, but that doesn’t mean that students who are already avid smokers are willing to change their lifestyle. Erica’s map reflects that, even when Harvard maintains its existing values, there are students who are willing and able to circumvent them.
Several students were reluctant to comment for this story because they feared running afoul of Harvard administrators. And despite some having a map of the best places to smoke, they certainly don’t want Harvard privy to their favorite places to take a hit.
Marijuana, then, is something of a disruption on campus, in more ways than one.
“I think it is a drug which can induce slight alterations in consciousness which allows one sometimes to be more aware of certain perceptions or ideas,” says Grinspoon.
Maybe that alternate state of consciousness is realizing that there is no alternate state of consciousness after all. The legalization of marijuana in Massachusetts does not significantly affect the status quo that Harvard students and administrators have cherished for years, and it probably will not for years to come.
And so our investigation into weed on campus—complete and incomplete—goes up in smoke, high above the spires and bell-towers, higher than you can ever imagine.

UPDATED: March 8, 2017 at 4:35 p.m.
 University President Drew G. Faust met with Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other members of Congress on a trip to Washington, D.C. last week.
Faust discussed her recent trip—her second to the nation’s capital this year—at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting. Faust also met with Kevin Brady, a Republican representative from Texas, Patrick Leahy, a Democratic senator from Vermont, and Ron Kind '85, a Democratic representative from Wisconsin, among other Congress members, during the trip.
Faust told the Faculty that she discussed the University’s federal policy priorities, including the endowment’s tax-exempt status, research funding, and federal policies protecting undocumented students. Earlier this year, Faust met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer to discuss some of the same issues.
“Last week I was able to meet with a number of individuals in Congress and in national media,” Faust said at the meeting.
Faust has been “ramping up” her engagement with national politics since President Donald Trump’s election in November. During his campaign and in the early months of his administration, Trump has proposed several policies, including restricting immigration from several Muslim majority countries, that Faust has publicly opposed. Faust plans to travel to Washington again in April.
On this trip to Washington, Faust took part in a media roundtable at Bloomberg News’ Washington Bureau. Faust told journalists there that funding for the National Institute of Health, a key source of Harvard’s research funding, remains a major concern. She also emphasized the importance of the National Endowment for the Humanities, which some fear could be defunded under Trump’s administration.
Faust said she also met with “a number of our alumni in Congress,” including Kind, Senator Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho, and Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland.
Faust’s more frequent trips to D.C. are among several steps the University has taken in response to Trump’s policies. Harvard jointly filed two amicus briefs challenging Trump’s executive order barring immigration from Muslim majority countries.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana will co-lead the faculty committee tasked with reevaluating the single-gender social group policy he originally spearheaded, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Michael D. Smith announced an email to faculty members Tuesday.
Music professor Suzannah Clark will co-chair the committee, which is currently comprised of 19 total faculty and administrators and will add student members “in the coming days,” according to Smith’s email. Smith said at Tuesday’s faculty meeting that the committee hopes to present its recommendations by the beginning of the fall semester, as the first class affected by the policy arrives on campus.
Starting with the class of 2021, the controversial policy bars members of unrecognized single-gender social organizations from holding leadership positions in clubs or varsity teams and being recommended for a number of postgraduate fellowships.
The  committee was created in the wake of intense faculty pushback to the policy; some professors, led by former Dean of the College Harry R. Lewis '68, sought to overturn it.
[Read here for an in-depth explanation of the status of the policy.] 
Psychology professor Jason P. Mitchell, a signatory of a motion that aimed to overturn the penalties, will serve on the committee, though none of his 11 co-signatories will join him. Lewis, declined to comment on the committee’s composition at Tuesday’s Faculty meeting. Lewis withdrew his motion shortly after Khurana announced the formation of the faculty committee.
Khurana announced the new committee after months of heated debate among Faculty members at meetings in the fall. In those meetings, some professors criticized College administrators for what they argued was a lack of faculty consultation prior to the policy's rollout.
According to Smith’s email, the faculty committee will be charged with familiarizing itself with the current social group policy and proposing “changes or expansions” to them.
“Further input from the faculty may strengthen our commitment to this approach or may yet uncover other approaches that are equally or even more effective at achieving our stated objectives,” Smith wrote.
The faculty committee will have dedicated legal counsel in University attorney Ara Gershengorn. At least one single-gender final club, the Fly, has retained legal counsel and has not ruled out filing suit against the University over the policy.
In January, after the committee was announced, Faust said she wanted to ensure that the final policy is legal.
“Ultimately, I want to be able to ensure that this policy is not going to get us sued instantly, is legal, is something that the governing boards feel is acceptable to implement,” Faust said in January.
Smith’s announcement comes one day after a committee tasked with crafting recommendations for the policy’s implementation released its final report, which suggested tasking the Honor Council with enforcing the policy, expanding the number of affected scholarships, and extending the penalties to members of the Undergraduate Council and The Crimson, a recommendation Khurana wrote required “further deliberation.”
In its report, the implementation committee also expressed frustration with the announcement of the faculty committee while they were completing their work.
“The lack of clarity as well as the events of the past month, namely the formation of a new faculty committee to review this policy, have had a particularly negative effect on conversations with numerous existing stakeholders in the College’s social scene,” the report reads. “These events have fostered skepticism about the intent and commitment to the policy, discouraged those students who are supportive of efforts to transform the nature of the clubs, and undermined the confidence and progress of those groups who have already made difficult decisions to move in a more inclusive direction.”
Pulling from multiple sectors of the University, faculty and staff membership includes Director of Harvard University Health Services Paul J. Barreira, Associate Director of Athletics Nathan T. Fry, and Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair. Associate Dean of Student Life David R. Friedrich, who was involved in meetings between administrators and final club graduate boards before the policy was announced, will serve as staff for the committee.
“With a recent focus that we’ve had across our faculty on this topic, there is quite a bit of material to aid their deliberations,” Smith said at Tuesday's meeting.
 Should the committee decide to amend or reverse the current social group policy, University President Drew G. Faust must approve the recommended changes. In announcing the committee, Khurana wrote that the Faculty at large will have the opportunity to comment on the committee’s proposals as well.
The members of the committee include:
Rakesh Khurana,  Dean of the College, Co-Chair
Suzannah E. Clark, Professor of Music, Co-Chair
Paul J. Barreira, Director of Harvard University Health Services
Theodore C. Bestor, Professor of Social Anthropology
David A. Haig, Professor of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology

Faculty pressed Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris on a new policy that would alter course schedules and increase standard class length to 75 minutes at the Faculty meeting Tuesday.
Harris presented a proposal for the revised schedule, which is designed to allow students to take consecutive classes on the College’s Cambridge campus and forthcoming Allston campus, slated to open in 2020. The Faculty will be able to vote on the proposal at its next meeting in April.
In order to increase scheduling efficiency, Harris proposed a designated set of start times for courses with 15 minutes of passing in between classes on the same campus. This would eliminate the de facto seven minute grace period for class beginnings known as “Harvard Time.”
“I do want to remind you that in many ways our scheduling practices, most of them actually, date to 1891,” he said.
According to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, the Faculty Committee—the Faculty’s highest elected body—unanimously approved the motion.
After Harris’s presentation, ten professors inquired about the composition of the proposal, asking questions on topics ranging from pedagogical concerns to worries about the technology used for scheduling.
English professor James Engell questioned how the proposed expanded class day—with the bulk of classes occurring between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. instead of the current 10 a.m. and 2 p.m—would affect professors with morning commutes.
“There may be a lot of faculty who don’t want to teach at 9 a.m.,” Engell said. “It’s not an easy commute for people.”
Engell also said he worried athletes would see diminished choice in classes given the longer course length.
“Students who are athletes who often have practices and commitments that begin at 2:30 or so,” Engell said. “Those students, it would seem, therefore have a reduced number of classes that they could attend.”
Responding to Engell, Harris said that many schools, including Stanford, begin classes at 8 a.m. and that athletic teams may have to adjust their practices to accommodate the proposed change.
“We are after all an educational institution and our student-athletes are student-athletes,” Harris said. “We will be working with all of them in different ways to think how they rethink elements of their practices to accommodate our mission.”
Other professors questioned Harris about the 75 minute class block and associated passing time, asking if existing classes would have to alter their length or if students would have too much passing time in if a professor did not use the entire 75 minutes.
Harris said that as long as start times were uniform, class lengths could vary, and that the new schedule was designed to accommodate a variety of teaching styles. He said that the potential extra passing time would be a trade-off to achieve the schedule’s larger goals.
“We’re trying not to have random start times, which is what we have today,” Smith said. “If you shorten the pass time, then those individuals who need the pass time are disadvantaged.”
Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Shaye J.D. Cohen asked Harris which classes would be offered in Allston following the construction of the new campus. Smith replied that in the future, more departments and courses could follow SEAS across the river, and Harris specifically mentioned that certain freshman seminars could move to Allston.
University President Drew G. Faust ended discussion of the motion shortly after 5:00 p.m. and told Faculty that discussion will continue at April’s meeting, when the Faculty could potentially approve the motion.
Government professor Danielle S. Allen also presented an update on the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging at the meeting. University President Drew G. Faust convened the committee in September to evaluate Harvard’s efforts to create an inclusive environment. According to Allen, the committee is currently in a phase of “learning and discovery” and will present an official report in the spring of 2018.
“We are not going to be making specific proposals on a school by school basis,” Allen said. “We expect to be proposing recommendations that recognize the diversity of schools across campus.”
The Faculty also approved the creation of a new Master’s Program in Data Science, following a motion by Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard. There was no opposition from the Faculty.

After a Harvard University Health Services survey found high rates of unprotected sex among undergraduates, the Sexual Health and Relationship Counselors are shifting their focus from peer counseling to peer education.
After consulting HUHS administrators, the group voted in December to focus more on educating students than counseling them, arguing the change would help promote sexual health more effectively. Both SHARC counselors and HUHS administrators said they were concerned about the survey data, which found that only 59 percent of students “mostly” or “always” used barrier methods of protection during vaginal sex, and even fewer students used barrier methods during anal and oral sex.
Amanda J. Ayers, a health educator in HUHS’s Department of Health Promotion and Education, wrote in an email that the department and SHARC “noted areas for improvement around student-reported sexual behaviors” in the survey data, and that she believes the transition will help spread “safe and healthy sexual behaviors” across the College.
Nora P. O’Neill ’18, who co-directs SHARC, agreed with Ayers, adding that the survey results revealed that SHARC was most needed on campus as a peer education group.
“The survey showed that a lot of people aren’t really aware of the resources on campus and also aren’t aware in general of how important it is to get tested for STIs and use protection,” she said.
While the switch will not officially occur until fall 2017, SHARC has already started planning more peer education activities. Previously, SHARC offered services similar to peer counseling groups such as Room 13 and Eating Concerns  Hotline and Outreach, which provide free and anonymous counseling to undergraduates in areas like eating concerns and mental health.
O’Neill and Bella T. Roussanov ’19, the other co-director of SHARC, said they have already spoken with leaders of other peer counseling groups about expanding some of their services to ensure that students can still find counseling on sexual health and relationship issues.
“There are definitely other peer counseling groups that are able to take up what we are leaving behind,” O’Neill said.
SHARC’s previous activities made the transition a natural next step, Roussanov said.
“We were kind of unique in that we were doing both [counseling and education] in some ways. We’ve always been doing peer counseling, but we’ve also been doing workshops, and more outreach,” she said.
The group hosts “Sexual Health 101,” a set of workshops that discuss methods to engage in proper communication with sexual partners, testing for sexually-transmitted infections, birth control methods, and other sexual health resources at Harvard. SHARC has also hosted regular office hours in upperclassman Houses to promote sexual education.
“I think [holding office hours] is a little more peer education-y than peer counseling because we are sitting in public with condoms around and people can just come up and ask us questions,” O’Neill said.
The group recently collaborated with HUHS’s other peer education groups to host “Spring Into Wellness,” where SHARC and the Harvard Health Peer Advisors and Liaisons shared tips for having a healthy spring break.

Scorpions bowls weren’t the only intoxicating substance distributed at the Hong Kong Restaurant in October 2016.
The Harvard Square restaurant, known simply as “the Kong”, closed briefly in early February for a narcotics-related violation that took place in October, according to an email from the Cambridge License Commission to Paul Lee, the restaurant’s owner.
The commission suspended the restaurant’s license from Feb. 7 through Feb. 10, and required the restaurant to post a sign stating that it was closed by order of the license commission. Ten additional days will be held in abeyance for one year.
According to a statement from the license commission, the Kong was found in violation for permitting “illegalities on the premises.”
The incident occurred around 10 p.m. on Oct. 5, when the Kong’s night manager, Paul Cugini, gave THC-laced gummy bears to employee Nicole Murphy upon her request, according to the license commission.
According to the transcript of a license commission hearing regarding the case, Murphy was unaware that the candies were laced. Upon consuming the gummy bears, Murphy felt numb, began talking nonsense, and locked herself in her car with the music playing at an abnormally loud volume, police recounted at a November hearing of the license commission. Officers from the Cambridge Police Department arrived at the scene to respond to reports of the disturbance.
After repeatedly questioning Cugini, officers reported that Cugini alleged to have obtained the laced candies from the doorman at the restaurant. With Lee’s cooperation, officers on the scene searched the restaurant and Cugini for illegal substances, but did not find anything, according to statements at the hearing. Lee fired Cugini shortly after the incident.
“I feel strongly that the cooperation with the police officer was very helpful,” Christopher Burke, former interim police commissioner for the CPD, said during the hearing. “It really cut to the chase and sped things up in terms of the investigation of the Police Department and that was appreciated.”
Murphy was transported safely to the Cambridge City Hospital and has recovered, according to Lee’s testimony at the hearing.
In the aftermath of the incident, Lee terminated Cugini’s employment at the restaurant but did not personally speak to employees, including Murphy and the doorman, about the incident until after the initial license commission hearing in November, according to the license commission’s statement. In a December hearing, Kevin P. Crane, the attorney representing Lee, said Lee had taken action to speak to employees in a group and individually and had everyone sign a “drug-free workplace policy statement.”
When determining the proper disciplinary actions, the commission took into consideration the restaurant's recent perfect disciplinary record, Lee’s cooperation with the police, and the seriousness of the offense, but did not take into account information provided after the initial hearing.
“The distribution, sale and consumption of illegal drugs is a serious offense and one that required the licensee to take serious action,” wrote Nicole Murati Ferrer, the license commission’s chair, in a statement. “Here, the licensee took no such actions and no reasonable steps.”
Lee did not respond to request for comment Tuesday evening.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana reaffirmed Harvard’s commitment to protecting transgender student rights last week in light of President Donald Trump’s recent rollback of protections allowing transgender students to use bathrooms matching their gender identity.
“I think we have a responsibility to make sure that everybody is treated in a dignified way,” Khurana said in an interview Friday. “I think making sure that people are able to use the facilities that are authentic to their identity is a part of that dignity.”
Trump rescinded Obama’s policy on Feb. 22, with members of his administration instead arguing federal law does not protect a transgender student's right to use bathrooms that align with their gender identity. Trump’s decision sparked protests across the nation and on Harvard’s campus; on Feb. 27, dozens of students gathered in the Yard to express their support for transgender rights.
Reflecting on Trump’s new policy, Khurana said he believes protecting transgender rights is the “right thing to do.”
“It’s a moral and ethical issue about treating people with dignity and I think Harvard College is committed to that,” he said. “Period.”
Some Harvard affiliates said they were pleased Khurana had chosen to speak in support of transgender students and transgender rights at the College.
“I appreciate his words of support, and I want to make clear that those things don’t go unnoticed,” said Lily M. Velona ’18, a member of the student-run Trans Task Force.
Velona added, however, that they believe Harvard should also take “concrete actions like implementing gender neutral bathrooms” in public places such as Lamont Library and the Science Center.
Many of the College’s 12 houses have converted gender-specific bathrooms to gender neutral ones in recent years, and administrators have said building gender neutral bathrooms is a priority in the ongoing House renewal project.
Sheehan D. Scarborough ’07, who serves as the director of the Office of Student BGLTQ Life, wrote in an email Tuesday that he was delighted—but not surprised—by Khurana’s words.
“I think it’s very meaningful for Dean Khurana to speak in support of the College’s trans population,” Scarborough wrote. “He’s been a strong supporter of BGLTQ student life, and this is no exception.”
Scarborough sent his own message to BGLTQ students at the College shortly after Trump announced his new policy. In the email, sent over an undergraduate BGLTQ email list on Feb. 24, Scarborough assured students that “Harvard’s protections for transgender students remain in place.”
“As someone who cares deeply about the dignity of every member of this community, I was upset and disheartened to read the news about the rollback of federal guidance to schools regarding protections afforded to transgender students,” Scarborough wrote to BGLTQ undergraduates. “I want you to know that you have a right to be here, to be visible, and to thrive.”
Khurana said Friday that he had his own message for transgender students at the College.
“I would say that I haven’t lived everybody’s experience, but I hope that our students know they’re not alone, that the people who are at the College—the staff and the faculty—are here because of them,” Khurana said. “Our students are what make us a school, that’s why we exist.”
“They’re not an afterthought,” Khurana added.

As Harvard administrators work to respond to President Donald Trump’s revised immigration order, hundreds of Harvard affiliates and local residents rallied in Harvard Square Tuesday to condemn the order and call on the University to do more.
The executive order, signed Monday and effective March 16, suspends visa applications from six predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and bars all refugees from entering the United States for 120 days. Current visa holders, green card holders, and dual citizens from the listed countries—Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen—are not affected by the ban.
The new order amends a previous executive order on immigration, which was marked by administrative confusion and generated uproar at Harvard and across the country. That order, signed Jan. 27, also included Iraq on the list of implicated countries and prevented current visa holders from those seven countries from entering the U.S.—including at least four Harvard affiliates. A federal appeals court ruling effectively suspended that order on Feb. 9.
At the rally, organized by the Harvard Islamic Society, international and Muslim students drew cheers from the crowd as they denounced the ban as Islamophobic and unconstitutional.
“This time, when he’s trying this more sanitized and supposedly more legal approach, we’re still here to say that we still see this for what it is: state-sanctioned bigotry that harms all of our communities and makes all of us less safe,” said Anwar Omeish ’19, a rally organizer and director of external relations for the Harvard Islamic Society.
Cambridge police officers blocked off streets as protesters marched up Massachusetts Ave. to Cambridge Common, chanting, “No walls, no deportation, no Muslim registration!”
As students and affiliates took the streets, administrators continued their efforts to respond to the changes in federal policy. University President Drew G. Faust addressed the updated order at the Faculty's monthly meeting Tuesday.
“Although the order is more narrowly drawn than its predecessor, I remain deeply troubled about its implications for Harvard," Faust told faculty members. “We face a very real risk that students and scholars from all corners of the globe may no longer see Harvard and other U.S. universities as attractive places to pursue their studies."
Faust said uncertainty lingers about how the new order will impact visa waivers, scholars’ ability to attend conferences, and the ability of the University to attract international students.
"We’re in the process of reviewing the details of the travel limits," Faust said at the faculty meeting.
The Harvard International Office, which recently updated its website with additional information, sent a message to international students and scholars Wednesday evening explaining the new order and warning visa applicants from the six countries to expect delays in visa screening and processing.
The email also “strongly” encouraged international students and scholars to take additional precautions when travelling abroad, including registering trips with the Harvard Travel Registry and contacting Harvard Travel Assist if they have difficulty re-entering the United States.
To affiliates from the six countries implicated in the current executive order, HIO Director of Immigration Services Maureen Martin said, “we’re telling them not to travel without talking to our office first.”
While Faust sent a University-wide message after the first executive order on immigration, she has not sent a message about the new order to the entire school.
According to the Harvard International Office, Harvard has 134 primary visa holders from the six countries, 77 dependents affiliated with those visa holders, and 17 pending visa applicants. Among the six countries, Iran is the most represented most, Martin said.
Martin said that under the new order, the 17 pending applicants who receive visa stamps before March 16 can enter the country. The HIO will continue to issue visa paperwork to applicants abroad, Martin said, but whether those applicants are granted visas will depend on U.S. embassies.
“There isn’t really anything a university can do to speed up the process at an embassy,” Martin said.
Martin said, however, that the HIO does have the ability to extend visas for students and scholars still enrolled in qualifying Harvard programs, and can help students whose visas will expire upon graduation this spring to prolong their stay by switching their visa status.
While the University took a number of steps to respond to the initial immigration order, some at the rally Tuesday were critical of how Harvard has dealt with the policy changes.
Last month, Faust sent a message to the University condemning the first order and joined other university presidents in signing a letter to Trump imploring him to reconsider the ban. Harvard also held several information sessions for international students, and administrators have designated Boston immigration attorney Jason Corral—who the University hired to counsel undocumented students—with providing legal advice to affiliates impacted by the orders. Faust also announced the appointment of Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain.
But hundreds of Harvard affiliate have charged that the University had not responded quickly or sufficiently enough, and more than 600 affiliates signed a petition demanding increased financial, legal, and mental health support. Since, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where many international students study, has pledged to provide financial assistance and adjust the time frame in which students must complete their Ph.D.—or “G-clock”—if they are stranded abroad.
Central administrators have not responded to the petition, and graduate student Laura Correa Ochoa reiterated demands for a response at Tuesday’s rally in Harvard Square.
“We need more institutional guarantees from Harvard and far more direct legal support,” Correa Ochoa said through a megaphone to the crowd. “It not only has the resources to do so; it should be a leader against the policies of the Trump administration.”
Asked for comment, University spokesperson Melodie L. Jackson pointed to a statement in the HIO email to international affiliates Tuesday.
“The HIO is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the University to offer resources and support,” the email reads.
The HIO will hold an informational meeting Wednesday morning in Sever to address questions and concerns related to the impact of the order on Harvard affiliates.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following an historic Ivy League Heptagonal Championship, the Harvard women’s track and field team will travel to College Station as Texas A&M hosts the NCAA Indoor Championships this Friday. Representing the Crimson in the two-day event will be senior Nikki Okwelogu, sophomore Gabby Thomas, and freshmen Zoe Hughes and Judy Pendergast.
The foursome arrives to the NCAA Indoor Championships on a high note after a confident and record-setting Heps title.
Thomas, a sprinter and Olympic trial qualifier, enters the preliminary round of the 200m dash seeded sixth. The Florence, Mass., native put forth a great showing at Heps, emerging with a second consecutive 60m dash victory as well as the 200m crown. Thomas is enjoying a lot of recent momentum in the latter event after setting an indoor Ivy League record of 22.88 seconds, the seventh fastest time in the country, as well as a new indoor school record at the meet two weekends ago.
“Gabby is just an unreal athlete and her natural talent is actually unbelievable,” freshman hurdler Karina Joiner said. “I have no doubt she’ll go on to win meets on a large scale because her work ethic and talent combine to make her a very elite and versatile athlete.”
At the conclusion of the Ivy Heps, Thomas was named the meet’s Most Outstanding Track Performer. This week, she also received the USTFCCCA award for Female Track Athlete of the Year in the Northeast Region.
The next competitor representing the Crimson is the pentathlete, Hughes, who ran in the championship winning 4x400 relay squad at the Ivy League Championships. The rookie is Harvard’s first Ivy Indoor Heps champion in the event since 2009, as she recorded the second-most points in Harvard indoor history with 4,093.
“I’m really looking forward to the NCAAs and maybe setting a new PR,” Hughes said. “I’m also excited to see the other girls compete for titles too.”
Her personal records are 19’2.5” in the long jump, 5’7” in the high jump, 61.20 in the 400-meter hurdles, and 4971 in heptathlon. At Heps, Hughes’ 4093 pentathlon points were good for 13th in Division I this season.
“You can tell Zoe is going to be great because she really wants to learn in practice and she puts a lot of effort into changing her techniques to make them better,” Joiner said. “She takes feedback well and applies it to training.”
Hughes, in the footsteps of her teammate Thomas, enjoyed the USTFCCCA award for Women’s Field Athlete of the Year.
Distance runner Pendergast won her first Heps title back in late February in the 5000m event, posting a time of 16:07.26. Pendergast is Harvard’s first Heps winner in the event since 2006. Pendergast’s personal records include times of 4:49.30 in 1600-meter contest and 10:07.18 in 3200-meter race. The Naperville, Ill., native is seeded No. 8 in the 5000-meter for the NCAAs.
Seeded at No. 16 in the shot put event is thrower Okwelogu. The senior is coming off yet another Ivy Heps shot put title, completing her four-year Heps sweep of the event, with a distance of 16.52 meters. The Fresno, Calif., native also holds the Ivy League record in shotput.
Okwelogu won Nigeria a shot put gold medal in the African Championships and also represented the nation in the Rio Olympics.
Over the course of her Harvard career, the soon-to-be graduate has posted her share of records and is only the second student in the Ivy League to claim four straight Ivy Heps shot put titles. As a first-year, the Olympian wasted no time leaving an impression on the league, as she set an Ivy League record in a discus throw of 53.31m.
Her current personal best is 56.75m. Okwelogu is no stranger to the NCAA Championships, as this weekend, she looks to improve on last year’s third place podium finish for shot put.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last Friday night, Harvard men’s volleyball suffered perhaps the most crushing loss of the season.
On the road, facing conference foe Sacred Heart (12-3, 5-2 EIVA), the Crimson built a two-set lead. Then the Pioneers changed defensive tactics, staged a comeback, and nabbed a five-game victory.
“The moment we got on the bus after last name…the focus was [on rebounding] on our side of the net,” junior setter Marko Kostich said. “We felt like we beat ourselves last game.”
The result, which stranded Harvard in fourth in the EIVA, left a bitter taste. Also lingering was the question of how the Crimson would respond to such an emotional bender.
The answer came exactly four nights later. On Tuesday, the Crimson gritted through a tight start against Coker (9-5) and zoomed ahead, earning a clean sweep at the Malkin Athletic Center.
“Friday was really tough, especially for being a conference match,” said junior middle blocker Riley Moore. “We just tried to work on a couple things that we hadn’t done as well on Friday, especially passing.... We tried to fix everything and come out today.”
Even so, doubt shadowed the court late in the first frame. A back-and-forth start to play left Harvard with an 18-17 deficit. A set loss threatened frustration and fatigue—in other words, a continuation of the emotions from Friday night.
But with captain Casey White serving, the Crimson mounted a 6-0 run. The game ended a minute later, with Harvard (6-7, 3-4 EIVA) emerging with the 25-20 advantage.
“The one thing you completely control in a game is your serving and your passing,” Kostisch said. “That’s what we excelled in [against Coker].”
Freshman outside hitter Erik Johnsson led all players with 12 kills, contributing to his .304 hitting percentage. The performance continued an impressive rookie season, as Johnsson ranks second on the team with 133 put-downs, exactly one behind White.
“Erik is an athletic powerhouse,” Kostich said. “The way he performed this game was super clean and high-level.”
White totaled eight kills but also recorded five service errors. As a team, the Crimson missed 15 serves, or five mistakes per set. Often, those missteps came because of increased aggressiveness, as players tried to drop balls in tight spaces.
In more competitive matches, those errors might prove painful. But against the Cobras, Harvard negated any offensive deficiencies with defensive prowess—especially in the third set.
In that final frame, Harvard posted aggressive blocks and scrambled for digs, limiting Coker to a -.188 kill rate. The Cobras had to settle for riskier shots, which resulted in more misses. Thirteen of the Crimson’s points came off errors by Coker.
Fittingly, the night ended on a mistake by sophomore outside hitter Gabriel Castro. Harvard emerged with a 25-17 frame and a 3-0 triumph—the team’s second sweep of the season. Late in February, the Crimson had downed NJIT in three sets, as well.
Heading into the match, sophomore Joao Victor Santos led the Cobras with 3.7 kills per frame. But on Friday night, the hosts held the 6’7” native of Brazil to seven kills versus eight errors. That performance translated to a negative hitting percentage.
“After the end of set one, we dug a lot of balls,” Moore said. “That’s really important.”
In fact, three other Coker players dipped below .000 on the night. Collectively, the Cobras slumped to a .062 mark.
In the second set, the visitors converted 10 kills on 22 attacks, but the Crimson overpowered that performance. Continuing the energy surge that ended the first frame, Harvard took an immediate lead and never trailed.
“We spread the ball around really well,” Moore said. “Our offense was really spread-out, which was good. Our passing worked really well too.”
With the Crimson owning a 15-6 lead, the game seemed on the verge of embarrassment. Coker narrowed the gap with a late-frame push, but the result was never really in doubt.
The final score stood at 25-20, pushing Harvard into the final frame—and, ultimately, into the evening with a 3-0 win.
“We’re getting better and better every day,” Kostich said. “The thing I’m really proud of is that everyone is working hard everyday. Usually at the start of the season, everyone is working their butts off, and they tire out later on. But everyone is working hard.”

The only thing more iconic than completing River Run is completing River Run without yacking. Here’s where to get munchies your throughout Housing Day Eve:
Early Birds:
Beat the stomach worm. Consuming some heavier foods in advance might help you avoid chatting with (Housing) God on the big white telephone later on. If you’re trying to run responsibly, preemptively line your stomach with vodka-absorbing pizza dough or tortillas. Otto’s and Felipe’s, with their plentiful portions, are open until 12 a.m. Or if you linger at a pregame, Noch’s and Border Cafe have got you covered until 1 a.m. Border bonus: your waiter will refill your liter-tall water cup at least three times, so you’ll be uber-hydrated and ready to down those diuretics!
Re-up:A few shots or paces in, and you might be feeling winded, hungry, or not-even-hungry-but-I’m-gonna-eat-cause-I’m-drunk. If you make it this far, take a pit stop at the Dunster Grille for a shake and some cheesy fries before 1 a.m. Whisper grace to the Dunster deities before slurping down your pick-me-up for good, greasy juju.
You also may find that while your upperclassmen friends kindly snuck you into their abodes and provided you with a round, they don’t have enough flat Sprite to temper the Burnette’s burn. Have some pity on your taste buds and purchase some chasers at the 24-hour CVS.
Night Owls:For you marathoners not yet checked into UHS, having a chat with HUPD, or slumped in bed by an unconscionable hour, luckily Harvard Square has a diverse array of late-late-night joints to cater to your inebriated, shameless, crazy college kid whims. If somehow your buzz has worn off, The Kong, open until 2 a.m. beckons with its scorpion bowls and mounds of white rice to soak up whatever the hell is in the scorpion bowls. If you’re in the mood to be disoriented by bright white tile and fluorescent lighting and listen to a series of numbers be shouted out until it’s your Price Is Right moment, head to tried-and-true Tasty, open until 2 a.m. Oft overlooked is Falafel Corner, open until 3 a.m., where you likely won’t have to wait in line and can savor some street meat. If you’ve got a sweet tooth, stop by Insomnia before 3 a.m. on your way back from Lowell and on the way to Adams, order a dozen cookies, and divide among your blocking group. When your night is finally over, like a reliable booty-call, Señor Jefe’s will be there until 4 a.m. Or, if you’re pulling an all nighter, rally at 24-hour Market with some overpriced coffee and a breakfast sandwich.
Cheers and Bon Appetit!

Yes, it’s true, Mark E. Zuckerberg (note the absence of class year), will speak at the University’s 366th Commencement Ceremony this Spring. Apparently having moved past the trauma of not getting into the Phoenix Club, the Facebook founder will show his face on campus. 
For graduating seniors, there’s a certain degree to which any advice the Facebook creator gives will be taken with a grain a salt, as each audience member will have something over Zuckerberg: actually graduating from Harvard. Yeah, he’s one of the richest and most successful nerds in the world, but he doesn’t have that Crimson-sealed piece of paper. Tell that to your friends back home.
Besides the whole ditch-college-make-billions spiel, we’re wondering what the dropout has to say. Maybe he’ll take some notes from fellow billionaire dropout Bill Gates’ 2007 commencement speech.
A commencement appearance seems to be a sentimental (albeit ironic) way to come full circle and reflect on his Harvard roots, so there are a couple different directions this speech could go. Will he reminisce about his own college experience, during which he was AdBoarded for creating facemash.com—the predecessor to a worldwide social network? Or will he talk about the time he was swerved by heavyweight rowers? Eh, that all happened over a decade ago, so today’s Harvard graduates probably couldn’t relate. Not like there are currently exclusive social spaces on campus or anything.

‘Twas the night before Housing Day, and all through the Square,Blocking groups jog through the crisp Cambridge air.Not yet hungover, knocking down shots without care,With hopes that the Housing Gods would hear their prayers.Supposed to be nestled all snug in their beds,With thorough midterm notes crammed in their heads,Freshmen instead donned their sneakers and “H” capsRunning on straight Rubinoff and a disco nap.
All about campus rang such a clatter,Proctors sprang from their beds to see what’s the matter.Across Mass. Ave the athletes flew like a flash,While after a few strides the Hum10 kids crash.The moon peering behind the Dunster House tower,Shines down on those running into wee hours.
When what to our wondering eyes should appear,But a HUPD car bringing up the rear,With a Boston local driving whose name’s probably RickThe runners hasten their pace right quick.
More rapid than Uber to each house they came,And whistle and shout and call them by name:“Now, Adams! Now, Lowell! Leverett and Quincy!On Dunster! On Mather! Eliot, Winthrop and Kirkland!To Quincy Grille and to Adams dhall
Now dash away, dash away, dash away all!”Merry Housing Day to all, and to all a good (safe) night!

Housing Day is quite literally just around the corner, and every Harvard student is gearing up to either 1) do river run and pray the river gods bless them or 2) pee in the Quad and pray for the river, or 3) get lit on Thursday morning and deliver amazing (or tragic) news for the freshmen. There are many ways to do Housing Day correctly, but there are also so many ways to do it poorly.
Take heed all ye Harvardians, because if you mess up this day you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.
Don’t: Travel loudly with your 8-person blocking group and try to walk past the aggressive House security guards.
You will be stopped. Your ID will be checked. You will be sent away.
Do: Get pumped with your blocking group on Thursday morning.
Maybe even spend the night in the same place! Definitely attend your entryway’s Housing Day breakfast events as a group. Peer outside at the houses gathering and get excited.
Don’t: Wait in a room with multiple blocking groups.
You won’t know whether to cheer or cry until an upperclassmen physically hands the letter to someone in your blocking group.
Do: Be prepared to get any house.
If your heart is set on one house, there is an 11/12 chance you could be disappointed. Thank you for equipping me with the skills to do that math, Joe Blitzstein.
Don’t: Cry if you get Quadded.
Even though the Quad is a faraway, barren place, try to save the tears for after the excited upperclassmen storm your room. Imagine if you were in their shoes.
Do: Partake in Housing Day festivities.
After you get your housing assignment, go to the Berg! Get free things! And definitely attend your new House’s steins and evening events to start mingling with others in your new house.
Don’t: Get festive to the point where you can’t wake up for your spring break flight home or your Friday classes (if you’re an unlucky soul with 9 am lecture Friday)
This is a shoutout for all of the people in Chem27, PS11, Stat, or a language class on Friday. Try not to concern your professor or teaching fellow by stumbling in wearing Wednesday night’s PJs Friday morning.

Eliot House. If you hear folks chanting “E-L-I-O-T,  you just won the lottery!” you’re most likely lost amid a sea of Eliot House residents on Housing Day. Situated along the Charles River, Eliot House is one of the most quintessential Harvard houses, boasting a beautiful courtyard and great river views. If you get sorted in Eliot House, you’re bound to experience a lively house committee—even if the house is a little over the top sometimes.
Eliot House is home to two pretty sweet senior party suites: The Cockpit and Ground Zero, but what can incoming sophomores expect? The typical layout of a sophomore room is n-1, meaning you’ll likely be living in a suite with one less room than the number of residents. Suite choices depend on what is left over after the upperclassmen choose their rooms. Generally speaking, sophomores live in doubles or quads.
Eliot is pretty big on community. You’ll be reminded several times in a conversation with an Eliot House resident that they “won the lottery” by being sorted into the house. From the moment you enter the house, you are a part of the “big and little” sibling program, which helps freshmen get advice from upperclassmen about both academic and non-academic issues. On top of that, Eliot boasts one of the best grilles on campus, the “Inferno Grille,” where a large array of grilled-cheese menu items await.

In the spirit of excess, Eliot hosts three formals throughout the year: Soiree in the fall, Formal in the winter, and the infamous Fête in the spring. On top of that, the house holds a charity auction every year where it sells goods and services from the residents in support of a cause.
We chatted with one of Eliot’s House Committee chairs, Gemma Collins '18, to learn more about the living in Eliot:
Why did you decide to run for HoCo? 
GC: I think that Eliot has a great community and house spirit. There are so many ways for students to get involved despite Eliot being one of the largest houses. The Faculty Deans are very open to new ideas from students.
Where are the best spots to chill in the house?
GC: “I would say the dining hall. There are a lot of small tables, big tables—it’s good place to hang out.” 
What type of steins do you throw, and what are the best events during the year?
GC: There are weekly study breaks for the whole house. They are typically pretty low-key, and usually focused around a certain activity. Like, there’s a tunnel painting stein and other big ones around big events. There are watch parties for the Super Bowl and sometimes karaoke. Sometimes they don’t have a theme—it’s just good food and good company.
How does Eliot do in IMs?
GC: Eliot has the most enthusiastic IM captains! They send out really fun emails to get people pumped. Eliot is super competitive, and IM crew is the biggest strength; we have the most IM crew titles for sure.
Still not completely sold on the Eliot House? Collins answered some of the frequently asked questions freshmen have who are sorted into Eliot:
 If you had to describe your house in 3 words what would they be?
GC: Spirited, welcoming, home.
What is the biggest misconception about your house?
GC: That we’re the “elitist” house, because in the house before housing [randomization], it was known as the rich kid’s house.
What unique events does Eliot host?
GC: The Faculty Deans have open houses. For instance, they have a cookie extravaganza, where students send them their favorite cookie recipes, and they bake them for the students. Also, there’s a charity auction, where people in the house give goods and services and people bid on it. That usually raises about $5,000 for a charity each year. It’s such a great community building event–seeing everyone outbid each other. Also, there are lots of fancy dinners, like holiday dinners.
Talk about your housemasters/tutors. Are you close with them?
GC: Yes, house tutors are amazing. It reminds you that Harvard isn’t just a place for 19 and 20 year olds. There are adults who have real jobs,  and grad students are here too. There are children who live in Eliot. It’s kind of like a big family.
If your house were a fruit, which fruit would it be? 
GC: Berries, because HUDS never serves berries, and we are a fun surprise.

Has anyone heard of a construction project that was completed ahead of schedule? Luckily for Winthrop residents—new and old—the entire house will be ready for move-in day this August, including the new Beren Hall. If fresh rooms, river views, and a tight-knit community are your thing, you might just hit the jackpot with Winthrop.

The layout for sophomore housing is a bit up in the air. In the past, sophomores in Winthrop have lived in either Gore or Standish Hall in n-1 quads consisting of two doubles and a common room. The common rooms were relatively spacious while the bedrooms left some things to be desired. If Dunster is any indication, the trend of having sophomores live in doubles will likely continue, but residents can expect their common rooms to remain large.
Before renovations on the house began, Winthrop had two unofficial party suites: C-51 and H-51. But now, who knows? Maybe your room could be the next party suite on the river, if you know how to have fun.

House Committee chair Danielle O. Strasburger ‘18 gave us the scoop on what the house community in Winthrop House looks like:
“We have a really great community and a lot of pride—we like to say that because it’s riffing off the lion stuff, like Winthrop pride, Throp pride is pretty big,” Strasburger said. “ Especially since we didn’t used to have a lot going for us, the house used to be looked down on because it was old, so we built a community that was about IMs and we always brag that we have the best tutor staff. It’s pretty loud, pretty proud, and a lot of fun.”
Anyone that has a friend in Winthrop knows that the house is big on IMs. We asked her what the deal is. Her response: “IMs are a definitive part of Winthrop because we’re really good at them. Mostly, we have people who care a lot, and put heart and soul into it. Even people who don’t participate in IMs still care about them because it’s a point of honor. We win the Strauss cup, so we have to keep on winning it because you don’t want to be the year to mess it up. It’s how I met some of my best friends in the house. Basically, being good at IMs is very much part of our character.”
So no pressure, rising sophomores, but you have a winning streak to maintain. Believe us when we say that this is a big deal. They even have their own website, complete with the schedule, record, and athlete of the week.
If IMs aren’t quite your thing, though, Winthrop hosts a really nice event towards the end of the spring semester called “THROPSTOCK.” According to Strasburger, the event is very much like the Woodstock Festival.
“It’s outdoors, right when the weather's getting nice again towards the end of the spring semester. We have live music, dunk tanks, last year we had an inflatable joust thing. The HUDS staff grills dinner outside In the past, it was held in our courtyard so everyone comes out, hangs out, we’ll put out blankets and lay out. So it’s relaxed, it’s a chill vibe, everyone’s happy to be there.” This spring, Thropstock will be held on the lawn outside the Barker Center, but will return to the house courtyard next spring.
Still looking for more information about Winthrop House? Strasburger answered a few more questions about house life in this uber-spirited community:
Why should we be excited for Housing Day this year?
DOS: “We are super psyched for this year because of the renovations. There has never going to be a year that it is better to be put into Winthrop than this year. So there’s a lot of hype around that—the new Winthrop building is going to be amazing. Housing Day is always fun but this year is going to be better than ever.”
What effect has swing housing had on Winthrop?
DOS: “It’s been different; in some ways, it’s been cool because it’s given us a chance to stop and look at what we’ve always done and really think about what we can do better. We’ve also been given more funds, which is nice. The biggest impact I’ve seen is that the sophomore class, who are all in the Winn, are really close because they’ve all lived together. Of course it’s hard with everyone being spread out, so we’ve done a lot of things to build up community, but overall it’s been positive.”

What surprised you most when you entered Winthrop?
DOS: “Honestly, I knew nothing about Winthrop before I got put into it, so everything about Winthrop was a surprise. For me, the IM stuff was new, and I hadn’t done IMs as a freshman but I got into them here as a way to meet other people and have a lot of fun. I found I really enjoyed house spirit and house life, like having friends across the grades. I was surprised by how much and how quickly it did come to feel like home and how different it was from the freshmen dorm.”
Would it be accurate to compare Winthrop’s lion to the Gryffindor lion?
DOS: “Yes, we very much pride ourselves on being the Gryffindor of Harvard, because we have a great mascot (the lion) and Harry Potter with his other Gryffindors always win things. We win a lot, like the Strauss cup, which is kind of similar to getting the house cup at Hogwarts. This past semester, we had a triwizard tournament. We’re also pretty daring and brave and courageous: We show that on and off the IM field, but also in the rest of Winthrop life.”
If you could liken Winthrop to a food, what food comes to mind?
DOS: “Any food that has recently become trendy. People used to sleep on Winthrop and put it below all the Quad houses, but now Winthrop is becoming a more dominant presence on campus because of renovations and IMs. So we’re like a food that’s always been great but hasn’t been recognized for its greatness, and now people are finding out that it’s actually awesome.”
Anything else we should know about Winthrop?
DOS: “We’re really big on diversity. We have a great team of diversity tutors," she said. "Our house administrator is black. We’ve done amazing programming for black history month, something that we’re really proud of as a house. We try to be really diverse and inclusive.”

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:
CORRECTION: March 9, 2017
A previous version of this story incorrectly indicated that the Faculty Deans of Winthrop were the only black Faculty Deans at Harvard.

Kirkland House is often identified by its “incestuous” parties or by its famous alumni (*ahem*Mark Zuckerberg*ahem*), but there is so much more to this house. The quirky, close-knit community of Kirkland has its fair share of traditions and secrets. Get placed in Kirkland House and you can expect to attend Boat Club meetings that—rumor has it—have nothing to do with boats, meet house staff who knew the Facebook creator before he was cool, and take place in a lively Secret Santa for the holidays. Here’s what else you can expect from this not-often-mentioned but very spirited house.
Hoping for one of those spacious singles Quadlings always rave about? This might not be the house for you. Kirkland is often described as.intimate. Though living spaces may be a bit cramped, you can expect to get close—literally and figuratively—with your roommates. Sophomores will either live in Kirkland or in overflow housing in DeWolfe, which has a floor designated specifically for Kirkland House residents. Expect n or n-1 rooms with lots of singles and doubles and in-suite bathrooms.
Kirkland has two ten-man suites located in B entryway, often colloquially referred to as “the Beef.”
Kirkland has one of the most vibrant house communities among river houses, largely on account of its many house traditions. There’s everything from Secret Santa—a week full of random acts of kindness and elaborate gifts—to the Kirkland Drama Society, which puts on a production every year. 
Speaking of drama: if you were ever a fan of the Broadway hit “Rent” than the idea of “wine and beer!” is probably enticing to you. Kirkland is known for its wine and beer seminars, which are hosted every other week by Kirkland’s Faculty Dean Tom C. Conley or one of the Kirkland's tutors, Luke W. Walczewski.
We sat down with one of Kirkland’s House Committee chairs, Handong Park ’18 to get frequently asked questions about the house answered:
What are the best “chill” spots in Kirkland? 
HP: The Hicks House (the house of a revolutionary in the 1600s that used to house Revolutionary War soldiers and is now a beautiful library and study spot), Kirkland’s dining hall, and the JCR.
How much do you interact with your Faculty Deans? 
HP: You're super connected to your tutors and [Faculty Deans]. Tom and Verena A. Conley host weekly wine seminars and tastings, always in the dhalls, and take their two Bernese Mountain dogs to the courtyard. Luke organizes the Brew Club which creates their own beers to serve at the biweekly Stein Clubs
Tell us a little bit more about Kirkland’s most notable tradition: the Secret Santa.
HP: Secret Santa. It’s a week of random acts of kindness and elaborate gifts, from dog play dates to YouTube videos of celebrities saying hi to a Kirklander, followed every year by the Holiday dinner where roasted boar heads used to be served annually, but now a fake boar is paraded around the dining hall.
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your house? 
HP: Kirkland is more than a house. It's a home that is extremely supportive, loving, spirited, and supportive. You'll always have someone to sit with in the dhall, and some event to attend for Kirklanders. The house has defined many students' Harvard experiences.

If you’re sorted into Adams House, you will be living in the closest house to Harvard Yard, meaning you’ll be the envy of your classmates. Wake up at 9 a.m. for a 9:07 class, take a dump in FDR’s very own toilet (in B-17), and study in gilded rooms? Yes, Adams residents truly win the Housing Lottery. 

Adams Housing is “more a village than a house,” according to HoCo chair Ryan Ward ‘18. Housing is split between five different buildings: Randolph Hall, Westmorley Court, Russell Hall, Claverly Hall, and Apthorp House (the Faculty Dean's’ residence). All the common spaces are concentrated around the dining hall, library, and common rooms in Russell Hall, which provide a focal point for social events. An underground tunnel system connects the buildings, decorated with murals which hearken back to the House’s artsy character pre-randomization. The interior of Adams is outstanding—straight out of the gilded age, back when the wealthiest Harvard students paid high rents for beautiful hardwood floors and paneling, Moorish ceilings, (real) gold accents, and stately study spaces.
Almost all sophomores end up living in Claverly Hall in doubles and triples with relatively large common rooms. Claverley features a grand, ornate central staircase and horizontal halls, which, along with the concentration of familiar sophomore faces in one building, creates a close-knit community. Note: Claverley is the one building not joined via the tunnel systems, so sophomores may have to brave the winter weather. 
As Ward puts it, there is “no such thing as a bad room in Adams,” and a select few may even luck into arguably the coolest crib on campus: Adams Senior House. The three story building houses a lottery-winning quad and is known as an optimal party space. For other seniors, A entryway boasts quints with common rooms and an “unnecessary amount of space.” However the newly-added K Space and Molotov Rooms allow any Adamsian to rent out a big party space on Friday and Saturday nights, regardless of club or social organization affiliation. Just dropping the name ‘Molotov Room,’ immediately boosts your kegger into sounding like a sophisticated, alluring, Bonds-esque soiree.
According to Adams House residents, the house has a bustling community that is very welcoming to people from all backgrounds, something the Faculty Deans John G. “Sean” Palfrey ’67 and Judith S. Palfrey ’67 work with students and staff to ensure.
This hallmark of inclusivity traces back throughout Adams’ history and is represented in events like the Halloween Drag Night, at which Adams affiliates (including the Palfreys and some dining hall workers) lipsync, dance, and perform wild skits, ending the evening with a rousing sing-along to “We are Family.” The Pool Theater, now a phenomenal performance space, was also known as an open space for BGLTQ students (and for its clothes-optional late night rendezvous—making it an appropriate location for the recent Rocky Horror Picture Show performance).

Another historical feature unique to Adams is the FDR suite, which has been renovated to look as it looked when the former President and Adams House resident lived there. Now it’s home to frequent “fireside chats,” which bring in world leaders and experts as speakers.
Every Thursday night, Adams hosts Carpe Noctem, the Adams equivalent to Stein Clubs. At this event, HoCo members serve pizza and drinks. Freshmen assigned to Adams can expect to gain “another set of grandparents and pediatricians,” in the Palfreys, according to Ward. They host warm teas and Sunday night study gatherings in Apthorp house, complete with baked goods and cocoa. Above all, Ward says “Adams House is truly a home because of them.” And, if you had any doubt about the Palfrey’s enthusiasm about their house, just check out Sean Palfrey’s carefully-curated list of  “100 Things to Do in Adams House.”
Still not completely sold on Adams House? Ward hit on some of the frequently asked questions freshmen have about the house:
What is one thing you want freshmen to know about your house? 
RW: While yes, location is a big plus, it’s not the only attribute freshmen should be excited about. Yes, Adams is very close to the yard, but the benefits do not stop there. Between the incredibly warm and welcoming staff and faculty deans, beautiful rooms, and gatherings like carpe noctem, if you get Adams you should truly feel like you’ve won the lottery.
If you had to describe Adams in three words, what would they be? 
RW: Historic, luxurious, home.
If you had to liken your house to a harvard square eatery, which would it be and why?
RW: Well what’s the bougiest eatery? I’d say Henrietta’s Table—warm, welcoming, and friendly but at the same time bougie and extravagant.

Freshman may not know very much about Quincy and probably haven't had much interaction with the house save for pleading with its HUDS staff members—well-trained in the art of freshman-spotting—to let them eat in Quincy's dining hall at dinner. However, freshman lucky enough to end up in Quincy will enjoy a slew of really cool house perks, including a prime location between classes and Harvard Square, a well-stocked Grille that stays open late and serves up tasty treats, and game tables in the main lobby. Not to mention an oddly gripping recurring miniseries about the house’s mascot, the Quincy Penguin.
Quincy students are blessed with relatively large rooms. While juniors and seniors naturally have the larger rooms in New Quincy, sophomores live in Old Quincy. The dorms in Old Quincy are mostly walk-ups with one or two rooms per floor, and are smaller in size like most of the other sophomore housing options along the river. Looking for more room? Quincy allows you to apply for overflow housing in the nearby DeWolfe Apartments, which typically have two doubles, a spacious common room, and an in-suite bathroom and kitchen. If you’re lucky, though, you’ll be placed in New Quincy, which boasts a larger number of singles as well as an elevator.
Quincy boasts an excellent ceramics studio and a House gym. The Qube library, which hovers over Quincy’s courtyard, is a popular study space for students and is a beautiful spot on a sunny day to work. Students within the house seem to have mixed feelings about the architecture of the dining hall and the new and old parts of the building, but Quincy is know as the “People’s House” because of its central location and bustling atmosphere. Quincy’s most popular spaces to spend time in include the newly renovated JCR, Quincy Grille, Stone Hall basement, and study nooks on the fourth floor of Stone Hall.
We took a trip to Quincy House and asked current residents some questions about their experience living in this Square house:
How is Quincy doing in IMs this year? 
Nathaniel J. Brodsky ’18: I’m not a huge IM guy myself, but I can tell you for sure that we’re in the broomball championships. It’s a pretty big deal.
What are the best places in Quincy to chill or hang out?
NJB:  I always love the dining hall. But my favorite is probably the grill. The people love it, and we are the house of the people after all.

What is unique or special to your house? 
Andrew R. Puopolo ’19: I think we have a very intimate house community that many other houses don’t have. Our faculty deans, Deb and Lee, are instrumental in hyping up quincy spirit. Also, the fact that Quincy is the center of campus is extremely convenient. And this dining hall is amazing, because it’s always got such a bright atmosphere and you always see student from other houses come to work here late at night. If you compare it to other houses at the center of campus, like Adams, it has the advantage that it’s kind of like a community away from a community in that it is fenced off in one Harvard Block.
What are some of Quincy’s best events?
Felix Wong: Quincy actually has quite a few events. For example, we have field days, and masters open houses. While all houses have that, I think Quincy does it particularly well, especially because we have a really awesome pair of faculty deans. Deb for example is known as the fun master because she plans out a lot of events. For example on Thursday we have community nights, and we actually are going to have a swing dance event this Thursday, and she makes a ton of great theme events as well.
Can you describe Quincy’s house spirit? 
FW: Quincy house is known as the people’s house, so we definitely have a ton of spirit and we’re definitely a close community. And I think we’re fourth in IM’s right now, so we’re definitely killing it. There’s definitely a lot of house spirit, and you can always see that on Thursday night community nights”
What are some of your favorite Quincy House events? 
Miles G. Counts ’18: “They have swing dancing which is always great.
What would you want a freshman to know about Quincy?
Peryn E. Reeves -Darby ’18: I feel like Quincy is honestly the best house, because we have a central location, with great housing options, no pests, and it’s always lit on the weekends.

Lowell House is considered by many to be the "premier example of the Harvard House form." Its location is ideal, as it is situated close to Harvard Yard, Harvard  Square, and the Charles River. Lowell is most widely known for its bell tower and the Russian bells within that serve as an alarm clock to some begrudging students every Sunday afternoon. Still, freshmen who are lucky enough to get Lowell will enjoy a friendly house community and a slew of neat house traditions.
Currently, sophomores in Lowell live in mostly n-1 suites with medium-sized common rooms. Because Lowell is being renovated next semester, most sophomores will live in the Inn at Harvard. If Lowell’s Housing Day video is any indication, the Inn will be rechristened the “Lowelltell” once the house moves in.
Rooms in the Inn are mostly one-room doubles with in-suite bathrooms. For those sophomores that end up in other swing housing locations, there’s a chance they may be blessed with a spacious common room and an array of triples and quads that are still relatively close to Harvard Square.
Lowell is the embodiment of a tight-knit, somewhat niche community. Boasting two of the most involved Faculty Deans in any of the upperclassmen houses, Lowell is known for its quaint Thursday afternoon teas where Lowell residents gather in the Faculty Dean’s residence for tea and baked goods. According to House Committee Chair Juliana Rodriguez ’19, the house has a slew of unofficial mascots, including “Bacchus, the Blue Morphy Man, Fists&Arrows, and the Lowell Tide.” 
“Lowell House has been known to really give off a “family vibe,” Rodriguez said. “We are really looking forward to spacious swing housing, and the Class of 2020 will come back to an incredible renovation that will include so many new social spaces, like a theatre.”
Another staple of the Lowell Community is the annual tradition of Lowell speeches, which occur over the course of the spring semester. Students can give speeches about any topic and are assigned a mentor to help them with their public speaking.
We took a stroll through Lowell’s dining hall to ask house residents about the experience of living in Lowell:
What are some of the highlights of Lowell’s house community? 
JR: Lowell house is the archetypal and ideal house life experience, often serving as a model for other houses! We have incredibly prideful and active alumni including two Supreme Court Justices, Nicholas Kristof, Natalie Portman, and Matt Damon. Distinguished professors and professionals, prominent administrators and a superb tutor corps make up the Senior Common Room which joins us for formal High Table dinners, lunch conversation, caroling around our traditional holiday Yule Dinner, a raucous trivia night, and serve as dedicated mentors.

Why did you run for HoCo? 
JR: I love Lowell because the community is truly warm, inclusive, and supportive; and we have some of the most enduring traditions. Thursday tea is a great way to unwind from the week and meet so many wonderful people. I joined HoCo because I love how active it is in the house, planning an event each week of the semester.
If you had to describe Lowell in three words, what would they be? 
Ikeoluwa Adeyemi-Idowu '19: Cute, traditional and connected, literally.
Tell us a little bit about your Faculty Deans Diana L. Eck and Dorothy A. Austin. How often do you interact with them? 
II: They are really, really sweet. I’m not that close with them, but Diana gave me a hug the other day. They make an effort to learn everyone’s name.
Is there anything you would change about Lowell? 
II: I’d make the dhall a lighter shade of yellow. It’s a little harsh.
Are you looking forward to swing housing? 
II: [I’m] looking forward to [swing] housing because it’s great, but also I’m a little worried about the community being literally split apart, because now we’re all literally connected underground.
