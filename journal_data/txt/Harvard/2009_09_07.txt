After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When students entered the Yard last week to shop classes, they surely noticed the sea of pastel-colored chairs dotting the center of Harvard’s campus—and perhaps even stopped for a seat themselves. The 476 chairs and 82 tables, spread throughout the Yard and the Quad, represent the first initiative of a 22-member Committee on Common Spaces, which University President Drew G. Faust tasked with developing new social spaces for the Harvard community.While the reaction of the student body has been mixed, the chairs do bring a new and welcome character to warm, sunny days in Cambridge. Combining aesthetic appeal and a welcome social atmosphere, they are a positive first step in the worthy effort of creating new social spaces. Daily student artistic performances at lunch, alongside innovative outdoor food vendors, also add a unique and creative touch to an otherwise average stroll through the Yard.While only a temporary project—with plans to remove the chairs at the end of October—they are meanwhile a truly a terrific addition to Harvard Yard. Simple and tasteful, they provide an easy way to enjoy nice fall weather with fellow students. Furthermore, a scattering of chairs throughout the Yard is very conducive to furthering social interaction and spontaneous conversation. Within such a high traffic area, students are bound to see familiar faces or make new acquaintances while enjoying a seat outside.We are pleased to see the administration embracing this inventive move to address a lack of social space on campus. Instead of fixating on the idea that the chairs might not fit well with a traditional image of Harvard Yard, administrators took somewhat of a risk and found an unconventional and elegant manner to give students a brand new way to congregate. The new food vendors and artistic performances are, similarly, original and unexpected initiatives that represent a new and welcome enthusiasm for experimentation.This initiative could be a great complement to future and more permanent ideas for adding social space, and the administration should not hesitate to use the same risk-taking spirit in their future efforts to address this issue. To quote Henry David Thoreau, a Harvard graduate of 1837 who lived in the Yard himself, “The world is but a canvas to the imagination.” We are excited to see what this committee will unveil next.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Normally, I confine my writing on this page to sophisticated and important topics, such as the Democratic Party’s own Benedict Arnold, otherwise known as Joseph Lieberman (20 percent of all my op-eds have focused on this topic). However, now that I am a second-semester senior and on my victory lap at Harvard, I feel liberated to opine on less serious topics. Thus, I pose this question: Where the heck did my hot breakfast go?
At this point, everyone is familiar with the raft of cost-saving measures the ever-so-wise college administration has implemented in order to slice a few million dollars out of what was apparently a bloated operating budget. These cuts come in the face of—and this is just ballpark, folks—about 10 billion lost dollars in our endowment (summary of the budget fiasco thus far: salaried administrators 1, wage-earning Harvard employees 0). Recently, the powers that be realized the silliness of their proposed changes in the shuttle schedules and repented. Why can’t they do the same for hot breakfast? 
My argument is airtight. Since Harvard is still the wealthiest university out there, and many other universities undergoing similar budget crises can still afford hot breakfasts, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t offer them too. QED!
But, if my detailed economic analysis is not sufficient for you (sophists), then take the fact that I just really don’t like cereal. Soggy, generic, multicolored grain rings will never appeal to me. And while I don’t mind some wheat toast and a hardboiled egg, I’m not sure that will sustain my palate five days a week for an entire semester. What can I say—I’m from Maine, home to lumberjacks and lobstermen who know and promote the value of a big, heaping, hot breakfast to start off the day. And I thought Harvard was for the people! 
I could keep going with other thoughtful and substantiated arguments concerning the breakfast question. What about the athletes? I can tell you that I spend at least 20 minutes a day on the “five” setting on the treadmill, and it makes my metabolism hum (yes, ladies). Or consider the “varsity” athletes. Can these finely tuned Division I machines really be expected to trudge to Annenberg every day just to get enough calories to survive? What about Steve, the Winthrop employee who used to man the grill every morning? He was a damn good hot breakfast chef and a really nice guy, especially to those hungry lettermen and women. Where is he now? For all I know, he might still be working for HUDS, but I think we can safely assume he’s not spending too much time concocting omelets.
So, I admit, there may not be too many reasons why hot breakfast is absolutely imperative to the lives of Harvard students. But that doesn’t mean it’s not important. I do find it strange that the school looks to scrimp in such small ways: cutting the breakfast shift, reducing the shuttle schedule, upping the cost on transcripts. Penny-wise, pound-foolish comes to mind.
Hopefully, the global economic crisis will resolve quickly, Harvard will invest in some bonds created from bundled life-insurance policies, and these impecunious days will fade into a distant memory. For now, the sweet aroma of pig fat draws me to the dining hall—thankfully, Harvard has enough sense to keep serving hot breakfasts on the weekends. But that just makes Mondays that much worse.

As students pore over the online Courses of Instruction, incoming freshmen must puzzle through Harvard’s newly improved answer to the liberal arts. As the first crop to graduate under the General Education requirements, the Class of 2013 should—at least in theory—emerge from the university with a better grasp of the world than the rest of us possess. But, despite the Core’s laborious overhaul, the College has yet to address a significant gap in our education. At a university renowned for producing leaders in all fields, it surprises me that the undergraduate curriculum lacks an emphasis on public speaking. 
Many, it seems, do not view oratorical abilities as a skill that can—or should—be taught.  While the Expository Writing department offers Expos 40: Public Speaking Practicum in the spring, it caps the course at only 12, likely reflecting the level of undergraduate demand. Compare this to Expos 20, which Harvard requires every freshman to take. Clearly, the powers that be recognize that incoming students, accomplished and talented as they may be, still benefit from an introduction to Expository Writing. And, despite the yearly complaints, Expos 20 does its job. But while public speaking resources do exist (including classes at the Bok Center, programs at the Bureau of Study Counsel, an Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding course, and a Crimson Toastmaster’s Club), Harvard leaves undergraduates to seek out this help on their own, instead of requiring or encouraging oratory instruction.
Rhetoric, one of the three ancient arts of discourse, harkens back to the Greeks—beginning with the fifth century B.C.E. Sophists, or even earlier. Long ago, thinkers highly valued verbal persuasion and deemed it a central facet of education. The field of rhetoric changed and developed during Roman rule and onward, until Harvard itself established the Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory in 1806. It was Francis J. Child, the second professor to hold the position, who shifted the job once and for all toward literature and away from public speaking. Now, Harvard’s commitment to rhetoric is almost nothing more than a memory.
Today, the reason that a practice-based public speaking course isn’t mandatory—or highly sought after by students—might lie in its seeming normality. Let’s face it: Everyone talks. And at Harvard, everyone talks a lot. It’s easy to forget that chatting with your blockmate about her recent breakup—or even discussing India’s political system with a TF during office hours—just isn’t the same as standing in front of an audience, opening your mouth, and getting an idea across. Although you may never have need to speak in public during your college years, a multitude of careers require just that: Lawyers interrogate witnesses, public-school teachers explain their lessons, doctors present at conferences, CEOs lead board meetings, researchers convey their findings, academics give lectures, screenwriters pitch their scripts. The list is endless. True, Harvard does not pretend to provide a pre-professional education—we’re not MIT, after all. But learning to speak fluently in public isn’t like studying accounting or journalism. It’s a skill, but it’s a skill with endless application. More likely than not, you’ll find yourself in the spotlight at some point, with a question posed, and all eyes on you. Whether you succeed or flounder in that moment depends quite a bit on practice. 
Harvard sections seem like they should help solve this problem. After all, we’re stuck in a room along with a TF and 17 or fewer students, forced to spill whatever we’ve absorbed from a textbook or coursepack. Such a situation does simulate a public-speaking environment—if every student actually feels pressure to contribute. All too often, the three individuals who enter the class perfectly at ease in front of a group monopolize section discussions, leaving everyone else relieved (and slightly annoyed). As a result, those who most need the practice can easily retreat to the back, avoiding the immediate discomfort but also forgoing a greater opportunity.
However, there is a bigger issue at stake here. To think of public speaking as something that can be practiced in an ideal section mischaracterizes it as a pure skill instead of an art form. There’s a big difference between an adequate orator and an inspiring one, and the difference does not lie in avoiding obvious faux pas, like not breaking into a terrible sweat or remembering the rules of grammar. Undergraduates could probably figure out the mechanics of public speaking without lessons. But when it comes to crafting a persuasive message and delivering it in a persuasive manner, the task becomes more difficult. Beyond that, learning how to speak from the heart—to convey internal passion and spark that same emotion in listeners—seems like a lifelong endeavor. I, for one, can use all the help I can get.
The undergraduate culture’s emphasis on extracurriculars allows certain students to work toward this goal, since many feel strongly about the organizations they run and exert endless energy in attempts to motivate their peers. Yet, on a campus where the majority of organizing occurs via e-mail lists and Facebook events, many student leaders spend more time online than on stage. While this experience is certainly valuable, it exercises a specific skill set that does not necessarily translate to real-time oration.
When it comes down to it, I am not suggesting that Harvard add another requirement to its already lengthy General Education curriculum. Quite the opposite: I wish that Expos 40 was in such high demand as an elective that the College needed to offer 15 sections. It’s easy to forget that a combination of high intelligence and natural eloquence simply doesn’t equate to public-speaking prowess. And—if we forget—we just might find ourselves center stage with nothing important to say.

The Recording Industry Association of America has requested that Joel Tenenbaum, the Boston University graduate student convicted of illegal file-sharing, be slapped with an injunction for allegedly inciting file-sharing activities through online mediums.
In a motion filed in a Massachusetts federal court, the RIAA argued that Tenenbaum has violated this summer’s ruling—which ordered him to pay $675,000 for file-sharing—by encouraging other internet users to engage in sharing activity and it asked that Tenenbaum be prohibited from promoting sharing.
The motion comes in response to a file-package posted on the Swedish file-sharing web-site The Pirate Bay that advertises a set of 30 songs—the same songs Tenenbaum was ordered to pay damages for by sharing online—as the “The $675,000 Mixtape.”
The RIAA argue that Tenenbaum promoted the torrent and other illegal downloading activity, in violation of the ruling against him, with a post on a Twitter account devoted to his legal case called JoelFightsBack. “Interesting: a “joel” torrent list of the 30 songs is now on thepiratebay/other torrent sites and is being DL widely in protest,” Tenenbaum wrote.
But in an interview with The Crimson yesterday, RIAA Spokesperson Cara A. Duckworth said Tenenbaum’s illegal activity goes beyond the Twitter post.
Duckworth said Tenenbaum has flouted the letter and the spirit of the ruling against him by allowing links to file-sharing web-sites to be posted on his web-site, repeatedly arguing for the legality of file-sharing in interviews, and by keeping illegal files on his computer after being convicted.
Tenenbaum and his legal team contend that his recent statements represent nothing more than an exercise of his basic rights.
“He is a citizen of the United States with full First Amendment liberties and he should exercise them as he sees fit,” said Law School Professor and Tenenbaum’s attorney Charles R. Nesson ’60.
Tenenbaum’s case has emerged as a symbolic struggle between those who hope to see an open internet, unfettered by copyright constraints, and conservative industry groups whose revenues have been decimated as a result of file-sharing networks.
As a result, the RIAA has tried to use Tenenbaum as an example to dissuade other file-sharers and has employed overly aggressive tactics to that end, Nesson said.

The Roosevelt Institution launched its first chapter at Harvard on Saturday afternoon, drawing a crowd of over a hundred progressive students in the basement of the Student Organization Center at Hilles.
Billed as the country’s first student think tank, the Roosevelt Institution was founded jointly at Stanford and Yale in 2004, as a memorial to the progressive policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Class of 1904. It now consists of almost 7,000 undergraduate members and over 70 college chapters nationwide
At the Saturday event, the keynote speaker Joseph R. Driscoll, a Mass. State Representative, told the group that if they joined the organization they would be able to participate in local, state, and even national policy debates. 
“This is not just a think tank that will be a silo,” he said. “There are generations that get unique opportunities, and yours is one of them.”
Matthew Young ’12, a founding member of the Harvard chapter’s steering committee, said in his speech that members will work with their counterparts at other colleges to lobby for change on issues ranging from local politics to healthcare.
“If you want to go fast, go alone,” said Young, who wore a T-shirt emblazoned with Roosevelt’s face. “But if you want to go far, go together.” 
Young added that students can work with professors on policy research, get published in national journals, and participate in “fireside chats,” where students and professors will talk politics over hot chocolate.
“Students underestimate their abilities to advance legislative goals, especially about the issues they care the most about,” Young said. “There’s actually a lot that students can do.” 
Despite the think tank’s liberal bent, conservatives on campus did not protest the inception of the new chapter.
“What’s in a name, right?” said Brian J. Bolduc ’10, editor emeritus of the Harvard Salient and an active Crimson editorial editor, referencing the organization’s association with the famed architect of the New Deal. “As long as they’re willing to have different points of view expressed, the name isn’t that big of a problem.” 
“Everyone can agree that FDR led this country through a difficult time,” said Colin J. Motley ’10, president of the Harvard Republican Club. “But from what I’ve observed, there’s a tendency in the work of the Roosevelt Institution to favor government intervention in the economy and other things that might make it difficult for conservative students to become involved in the organization.” 
“We always welcome competition of ideas on campus,” said Rachel L. Wagley ’11, co-president of Harvard’s pro-abstinence group, True Love Revolution. “The more the merrier.”

Harvard College Democrats and the Harvard Republican Club clashed in a debate on health care reform this Saturday.
In a heated discussion that centered primarily around the public healthcare option advocated by President Barack Obama, Democrats William F. Weingarten ’11 and Cyrus B. Kornfeld ’12, asserted that public option will increase care access, while Republicans Colin J. Motley ’10 and Jordan A. Monge ’12, contested that the plan will be costly and inefficient.
Kornfeld opened the debate by pointing out what he saw as a crisis within the current healthcare system, which “allows a hundred thousand people to die sick every year without receiving treatment”.
“A public option is the perfect cure for this unhealthy healthcare system. It is not driven by the perverse incentives of those private healthcare companies, and it will inject competition into the market,” he said.
Motley argued that a public option  will crowd out private providers, suppress competition, and “not solve the problem at an acceptable cost” to the taxpayers. Instead, Motley proposed a four-point plan which he said will stimulate competition and drive down costs.
The plan included lifting restrictions on inter-state insurance purchase, eliminating employer tax exemptions for healthcare, capping amount awarded in malpractice suits, and investing in information technology to increase access to primary care practitioners.
“This isn’t a solution we can live on. We need to do something that will bring cost under control,” Weingarten said of the Republicans’ plan. “We cannot afford to let insurance companies play with our lives and our money as they continue to cover less for more with no incentive to change.”
The event, advertised as a part of “Get Involved Weekend” hosted by the FDO, was attended primarily by freshmen.
Spencer Todd ’13, said he was drawn to the event by his interest in politics. 
“I thought this was one of the best debates I’ve seen. The Republicans dealt with the issues substantively, and neither side tried to clot the debate with rhetoric,” Todd said. “This definitely made me more interested in getting involved.”
“The debate answered many important questions, but I wish the Dems could have better addressed the Republicans’ [proposed] plans and some of the misleading statements that they said,” Nicholas Pomata ’13, said.
The debate was hosted by the Harvard Political Union and moderated by HPU Chairman Shankar G. Ramaswamy ’11.

Even reigning Ivy League champions can struggle to find a rhythm. Coming off a campaign that resulted in its first Ancient Eight title in nine years, the Harvard women’s soccer team still found plenty to work on before the Ivy slate begins in three weeks.The Crimson (0-1-1) kicked off its 33rd season at Ohiri Field on Friday afternoon, battling a slow start in a 1-1 double-overtime draw with San Diego State (2-2-1).“We didn’t bring the effort, we didn’t bring the pride that we usually do to this field,” co-captain Lizzy Nichols said.Although the Crimson returns with the majority of its starting lineup—including its top three goal scorers—it was not an upperclassman that put Harvard on the scoreboard.Of the Crimson’s 10 incoming members of the class of 2013, several logged significant playing time in the 110-minute season opener, including defender Taryn Kurcz and midfielder Aisha Price.The most visible was freshman forward Caroline Albanese, who put her team ahead 1-0 in the opening two minutes of the second half. All-Ivy junior forward Katherine Sheeleigh passed the ball down the right side to a streaking Albanese, who snuck a shot to the right of the diving Aztec keeper.The goal came after a scoreless first half marked by staunch defense, with each team managing only two shots on goal during the period.“Just looked slow, speed of play [was] slow—over-passing...I think it was just first game jitters,” Harvard coach Ray Leone said.Brought to life by Harvard’s late offensive awakening, the visiting squad went on the attack beginning in the 51st minute. One San Diego State shot hit the crossbar, while another went high, and a trio of corner kicks was cleared by the Crimson defense.But the fourth corner kick would be the charm, when Aztec defender Allie Crowson knocked in a header to knot the score at one goal apiece.San Diego State dominated the rest of the period, outshooting its hosts 8-2. As regulation time ticked away, the Aztecs earned a free kick on the left side. A San Diego State midfielder directed it towards the goal, only to find it turned away with two seconds left to play—not by senior keeper Lauren Mann, but by the post.Harvard renewed its attack in the first 10-minute overtime session, finishing with a 3-0 advantage in shots. Sophomore Melanie Baskind took her first crack less than a minute in, but her attempt was cleared, as was a shot by classmate Patricia Yau.In the second overtime, the Crimson’s endurance began to waver while the game-tested San Diego State—which nearly toppled No. 4 Stanford last week—flourished, outshooting Harvard, 6-0, in the period.“We’re not game-fit yet,” Leone admitted.The Aztecs had multiple opportunities for the golden goal as time wound down, but once again, it was the post that played foil. San Diego State captain Cat Walker followed a blocked shot with a strong attempt from just inside the box, which ricocheted off the left post with five and a half minutes to play.“I do think San Diego State deserved to win—two crossbars in the latter seconds of the game—we dodged it,” Leone said.Walker later had one of her game-high tying seven shots stopped by Mann with less than two minutes remaining, and an Aztec shot as time expired went wide as well.At the end of the day, San Diego State finished with a 24-17 advantage in shots and 7-3 in corner kicks.—Staff writer Dennis J.

What a difference a day makes. Following a one-goal apiece stalemate with San Diego State the previous afternoon, Harvard’s play reached another level Saturday evening at the University of Connecticut, but the 20th-ranked Huskies (1-2-0) were too much for the Crimson (0-1-1) to handle, as the visitors fell 3-1.“I think it was a dramatic improvement from the one game to the next game, so we’re really coming along,” coach Ray Leone said. “We’re further along than we were at the same time last year...I thought overall, there [were] a lot of good things.”Proving their lofty preseason ranking was no fluke, the Huskies jumped out to an early lead, netting two goals in a span of just over ten minutes. UConn’s first score of its home opener came at 5:23, when a Husky free kick attempt was passed off to an attacking teammate, senior Lauren Ebert, who took the cross and quickly found the back of the net.Crimson senior keeper Lauren Mann’s day would not get any better. UConn sophomore Melissa Busque put a header over the outstretched fingers of Mann, who made seven saves in the match, to give the Huskies a two-goal lead.“It’s obviously tough, but it’s a good chance for us to play goals down and see if we can respond well,” junior co-captain Gina Wideroff said. “I think we did a pretty good job of responding and not shutting down.”After Mann was forced to make two clutch saves on a free kick and a dart from close range by Ebert, Harvard cut the deficit in half on sophomore Hana Taiji’s goal late in the first half. Her first score of her career came in the 43rd minute on a ball deftly flipped over the Husky goalie’s head. Freshman Aisha Price was credited with the assist.“It was actually a great goal, because we went from one end to the other, with a lot of people touching it before it actually ended up being a goal,” Leone said. “It showed a little more mettle to our team...the game is not over just because you’re down two. I was very pleased to get that goal in the last minute or so of the half.”The Huskies controlled the ball the majority of the second stanza, launching three straight shots six minutes into the period. All were handled by Mann and the Crimson defense, but their success would be short-lived.Busque’s efforts at 68:01 turned a two-man trap in the right corner into a third UConn goal when she found an open Linda Ruutu, who then chipped a shot over Mann, sealing the victory for the Huskies.The 72nd minute found Harvard trying to make a comeback, as freshman Rebecca Millock and junior Katherine Sheeleigh both took their cracks at the goal. Their attempts were stymied by the UConn keeper.“It just didn’t go in for us,” Leone said. “But we did have a lot better chances than we did the game before [against San Diego State]...it was a great effort for our team.”In the final moments, a blast by co-captain Lizzy Nichols ricocheted off the crossbar, but the Crimson was unable to capitalize on the rebound.The hosts took 14 shots in the half to Harvard’s seven and held an 18-13 edge for the full 90 minutes, but the Crimson managed a 7-4 advantage in corner kicks for the match.Harvard will look for its first win of the season Tuesday afternoon as it returns home to face New Hampshire, a team it has beaten four straight times and in 10 out of the last 11 matchups.—Staff writer Dennis J.

Last season, Harvard field hockey squeaked by Holy Cross before stumbling to three straight losses. Perhaps after dominating the Crusaders in 2009, the Crimson can look forward to a better result.Harvard (1-0) opened its season on Saturday with a 4-1 victory in Worcester, Mass., handing Holy Cross (0-2) a resounding defeat on Hart Turf Field.Junior Chloe Keating led the way for the Crimson with two goals and an assist, while sophomore Carly Dickson set the table on two occasions to bolster Harvard’s attack. The two returning stars paired up for a goal early on, as Keating deflected Dickson’s shot from the top of the circle past Crusader goalie Kelly Casey 12 minutes into the contest.“It was a play we had practiced a lot and it worked well all preseason,” Keating explained. “I got a great feed from Carly and didn’t have to do much.”Following the early goal, Harvard rarely found itself in danger as the squad cruised to a 3-0 first-half lead. The Crimson dominated in most facets of the game, earning a 12-8 advantage in shots as well as an 8-4 edge in penalty corners. The ample number of scoring opportunities allowed Harvard to be aggressive on offense.“Our forwards were really active and everyone worked well together,” co-captain Kristin Bannon said. “In particular we executed our penalty corners, where we scored two of our goals.”Keating proved to be one of the most aggressive competitors, getting into the action on most of the Crimson’s scoring chances. Minutes after her first goal, the forward returned the favor of an easy set-up by finding freshman Emma Keller in the middle of the circle. Keller did not waste the opportunity, firing a low shot past Casey on the right side for her first collegiate goal.Sophomore Allie Kimmel followed five minutes later with her first career goal on an assist from classmate Dickson, demonstrating how much the Crimson will rely on its less-experienced athletes this season.“We have a very young team this year and it’s awesome that they opened the season with a contribution,” Bannon said. “It’s a great way to give [the younger players] confidence going into the rest of the season and their contribution will be crucial.”Keating also emphasized the importance of young players, given a large reduction in the 2009 squad’s size. Harvard boasts only 15 athletes on its roster this season, down from 20 last year, and Keating noted that the rookies must be ready from day one.“Our freshmen did a great job,” she said. “Because of how small we are, they will have to step up and contribute right away. They don’t really have time to get acclimated to collegiate athletics.”Despite being thrown into the fray, Harvard’s rookies appeared up to the task on Saturday. A three-goal lead proved more than sufficient for freshman goalkeeper Cynthia Tassopoulus, who earned a win in her debut with solid play in net. Although Holy Cross midfielder Alanna Sikorski converted a penalty corner at the end of the first half to pull the Crusaders within 3-1, Tassopoulus maintained her composure, notching a save and deftly diffusing a number of opportunities to quell any hopes of a comeback.The squads found themselves locked in a scoreless battle for much of the second half, but the Crimson’s consistent edge on offense eventually led to a breakthrough. With less than seven minutes remaining, Keating secured the ball among a crowd in the circle and fired a shot through the Holy Cross defense for a decisive 4-1 advantage.“It was a very strong performance and a great way to start the season,” Bannon said. “We battled tough and adjusted well...And hopefully this game sets the tone for the rest of the year.”—Staff writer Max N.

About a week after their initial placement in the yard, we wondered, how are the colored chairs doing?  We know they are meant to serve as a "new form of gathering space," so are they performing?
FlyBy did a lazy-Sunday lookover, and it appeared that about 30-40 percent of the chairs were full, and almost entirely by non-Harvard students. (We could tell because they were, um, old.)
The reclining chairs, which comprise about one out of six, seemed to be the most popular, and the footstools seemed to be generally ignored.  We were interested in what was keeping the rainbow dinette sets from being stolen, and a closer inspection revealed a metal cord wrapped around each array.  Very sharp, Harvard.  See the chair demographic in action after the jump.
For the most part, we have to say that even on an idyllic afternoon, with sun and perfect temperatures, the chairs were not really expanding the College's social space.  Most students seemed to have somewhere to go on their way through the Yard.  Unless you count the ever-present revolving door of tourists as part of the College, this is definitely a small first step.  Next stop, 45 Mt. Auburn.

Here at FlyBy we try not to pull any punches when it comes to criticizing things that our esteemed University does.
Our counterpart on the 10th floor of the Holyoke Center (the ever peppy Harvard Gazette), however, has moved from cheerleading this awesome, inspiring, innovative institution to celebrating…itself!
In an move sure to inspire the entire media industry, the Harvard Gazette is reducing its print content from weekly to bi-weekly publication and is increasing its online content. (The Harvard News Office assures us that this is a step toward media modernity, not the media apocalypse.)
Under the auspices of Perry S. Hewitt ’87, Director of Digital Communications and Communications Services (long title = important), the Gazette has completely redesigned its print publication and website. The snazzy new site boasts increased multimedia content (again, media progress, not media catastrophe) including photography slide shows, audio, video, and an event calendar.
“We consider this a step that is creating the equivalent of a daily paper online,” says Christine M. Heenan, vice president for government, community, and public affairs. Uh oh, looks like there’s a new daily on the block—and it’s increasing event coverage and moving features to the glossies.
All kidding aside, FlyBy applauds the Gazette for its swanky new design, and might even be a little jealous.

Have you always had a penchant for journalism? What about photography or web design? Want to help run a million-dollar business?
Flyby takes great pleasure in kicking off the fall 2009 comp for The Harvard Crimson.
Join the ranks of FDR, JFK, numerous Pulitzer prize winners, (and about 10 percent of the student body), and come to one of The Crimson’s open houses this week at 14 Plympton St.
Stop by at 7pm tonight, Wednesday or Thursday for a tour of the building where the magic happens and to hear a bit about each of The Crimson’s nine boards.
Check out the comp web site for more info and to sign up online to start receiving emails about the process.
And because we can’t resist a bit of self-promotion, comping The Crimson is the best (read: only) way to write for the best campus blog.
