After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In Jean-Luc Godard’s 44th feature film, a narrator speaks over a pastiche of film snippets, paintings, and excerpts from newsreels. “No activity can become an art before its time is over,” he says, his gruff voice the ominous undercurrent driving the film forward. But in “The Image Book,” (“Le Livre D’Image”), Godard’s submission for the In Competition lineup of this year’s Cannes Film Festival, neither art nor activity ever seems to end: The film is a combination of dozens, perhaps even hundreds of seemingly arbitrary pieces of visual and auditory art that altogether produces a mishmosh of what ultimately feel like disjointed elements, unnecessarily prolonging what could have been a much more succinct project. The result is a film whose statement gets lost in the mix, expressed in too fragmented a way to pack an effective punch.
The film teeters between experimental project and documentary-esque flipbook, at times pointlessly frustrating, and at others, poignant with a purpose. “Image Book”’s collage of clips randomly pause at various points, buffering like a video being played with bad wifi. Some of the coloration The audio, which does not necessarily correspond to the clips it plays over, is also cut off at different times in a mismatch that destabilizes the viewer’s focus. Do we listen or watch? Extrapolate or experience? The challenge of Godard’s work lies in keeping up with the incongruent media the director superposes in an intentionally disorienting entity perhaps meant to emulate the confusion of our times.
In certain instances, Godard does seem to allude to a particular kind of commentary relevant to the issues plaguing both the entertainment industry and the world. For example, he juxtaposes an excerpt in which an officer forces a woman to stand on a chair and turn around while he lifts up her skirt with his gun to peek under it with one featuring two women walking along a beach as two men harass them. “You live with Mom and Dad?” one leers. Godard’s message seems to be clear, at least until the scene abruptly cuts to another, one irrelevant to the conversation Godard seemed to be trying to have. Do we stew on the two previous scenes and their implications, or do we move on to the next potential metaphor? The answer is obscure, putting into question the point of the entire directorial choice.
Not all of Godard’s decisions in the film lose their poignancy, however. In another juxtaposition of clips, a black and white movie depicts men being pushed into a body of water, followed by a newsreel of actual people being pushed into a body of water, apparently against their will. The moment is the actualization of words spoken in a voiceover, according to which an artist can “put reality into reality” in a book, a meta self-reference to what “The Image Book” tries to do.
And it does try to do something, though what exactly that something is remains a mystery. Godard has previously said that the film is meant to comment on the Arab world, and he makes his stance obvious through his narrator in a voiceover that can only refer to the topic he claims to focus on in the film: Bombs, the voice says, are “the only way they can express revolts in the face of the government. I’ll always side with bombs.” The “they” is never explicitly named, but the ensuing insinuation is the first—or more likely, most straightforward—reference to Godard’s motivation to create the film. Unfortunately, that motivation also gets lost in the too subtle and too experimental film. “The Image Book” is in and of itself not a misleading title—on the contrary, it’s an understatement: The film is additionally a music, and video book—but that very characteristic undermines the film’s entire purpose. As the foreboding orchestral refrain returns throughout the film’s five parts, the audience is left waiting for the different pieces of the collage to amount to the tableau Godard has the capability to produce. It looks like for now, it will just have to remain in Godard’s head, for few will be able to make sense of the image book he has put together.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Cate Blanchett, President of the Jury, stood on the top of the steps of the Palais des Festivals, joined hand-in-hand with 82 female filmmakers and artists. It was a symbolic choice—only 82 women had climbed the stairs since the advent of the Festival in 1946. By contrast, 1688 male directors had mounted the stairs in the same time period. Blanchett, flanked on either side by powerful women, gave a speech on behalf of Time’s Up to advocate for better gender representation at the Cannes Film Festival.
“These facts are stark and undeniable. Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of our industry says otherwise,” Blanchett said. “We acknowledge all of the women and men who are standing for change. The stairs of our industry must be accessible to all. Let’s climb.”
The feminist energy that lingered after Blanchett’s speech lent a particular credence to the subsequent film premiere, a screening of “Les Filles Du Soleil,” Eva Husson’s breathtaking drama about an all-female battalion in Kurdistan. Led by their fearless leader, Bahar (Golshifteh Farahani), the women are at war with the extremists who have captured Bahar’s hometown of Corduene, a bloody conflict that French journalist Mathilde (Emmanuelle Bercot) hopes to cover in a longform report. As the titular group attempts to liberate Corduene, where Bahar’s son is being held, flashbacks to Bahar’s pre-battalion life paint a riveting yet bone-chilling picture of what she endured as a captive of the extremists’, a harrowing experience that hardens her into the commander she grows into. “All they’ve killed is our fear,” says Bahar in an inspiring speech that rallies the women to action. At its heart, “Les Filles du Soleil” is a stunning, visceral recognition of the power of female leadership.
It is no accident that its title hinges on the “Girls”: Most of them, made captives in their early youth, aren’t even quite women yet (Bahar and girls as young as nine are forced into sexual slavery until they can either be bought by a benevolent third party or escape). But the authority and self-direction that comes out of their trauma evokes the gravitas of much older, more experienced soldiers. And not only that, they are also adept empathizers, in tune with one another’s emotional needs. Husson pointedly cuts between scenes of the girls braiding each other’s hair, holding hands, singing together, and flashing to scenes of Bahar’s brutal abuse at the hands of male captors—the immense tenderness with which girls treat other girls juxtaposed with the immense brutality with which they are treated by men.
But the battalion would be nothing without its commander. Golshifteh Farahani’s adept, powerful portrayal of Bahar as a woman battered, then rising from the ashes of her abuse, is enough to draw tears. Bahar can be affectionate when she needs to be, but also resilient in the face of hardship; in the next instant, she embodies the model of a military commander, stoic and unafraid, a brilliant strategist. The men in the room pay attention when Bahar speaks. “She will be the one to lead us to victory,” Lamia says reverently of their commander. “She’s different than the rest of us. You think you chose her by chance?”
Husson, who also wrote the film’s screenplay, pays close attention to the ways in which women play the role of both caretakers and fighters, both nurturers and strategists. In that way, Bahar and Mathilde are foils, birds of a feather: They’re both mothers, stricken by the absence of their children (Bahar’s son Hemin was kidnapped by extremists, while Mathilde’s daughter Iris is at home in France, awaiting her mother’s return), but both professionals at what they do, ardently devoted to their respective causes. Bahar channels her vehement belief in her cause into her military career, while Mathilde is the patron saint of good journalism, snapping pictures in the midst of warzones. (Here, without seeming overtly propagandistic, “Les Filles du Soleil” also champions the inherent value of publishing the truth. “People could care less about the truth,” Mathilde says, in an emotionally charged moment between both women. “It’s one click away, and a tyrant can still come to power. People buy promises, dreams. Anything to avoid seeing this shit.”) In their partnership, they make each other better. Bahar’s courage jars Mathilde out of cynicism, while Mathilde tells her story.
Though that story is bleak, Husson imbues the grim world with lively color that reflects the hope and determination brimming in the women at the possibility of the extremists’ defeat. “She looks like a queen from the distant past,” says Mathilde of Bahar, perhaps referring to the young woman’s beauty, but more likely to the vividly colorful head scarves that she and all the other women wear. Their version of a uniform hat, the scarves contrast sharply with the yellowing crops of the fields of Kurdistan, giving life to an otherwise dying landscape. The combination is beautiful, but never takes away from the atrocities taking place: The film recognizes that it’s not “as if so much beauty could erase the horrors they’ve seen,” as Mathilde says of the increasingly green grass at the end of the movie. The subtle but crucial cinematography evokes flowers just waiting to bloom, like the women whose lives took a devastating turn for the worst before choosing to keep fighting a fight that should never have even started.
A poignant based on a true story, “Les Filles Du Soleil” is a story that reinvents our perception of a combat group, featuring courageous, strong women at the helm of Corduene’s liberation. The film is a commentary on what war can and does look like, the fighting beautifully rendered, moments of violence temperately balanced with scenes of the women’s perseverance, emotional vulnerability, bravery, and patience throughout the entire ordeal. These women, whose centrality to their main cause is undeniable, embody a sisterhood strong enough to win the entire war, and not just the battle for Bahar’s city. After all, if given the chance, there will always be women to take the lead: “If it had been oil and not milk that came out of our breasts, the coalition would have come much sooner,” remarks Bahar.
She’s right: Women are not valued as they should—not just in the film, but regularly in real life, as Cate Blanchett criticized—a mistake Husson makes sure to show proves deadly for those who would underestimate them. With its delicate, beautiful editing and its raw emotion, it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say that “Les Filles du Soleil” is a real contender for the Palme d’Or. If the Jury’s evident endorsement of the film is any indication, that possibility does not seem far off.

It’s a hard knock life for trolls—not the kind living under the bridge, nor the “Can’t Stop the Feeling” dancing cartoons, nor the kind that lurks in the dark depths of Twitter. The troll at the center of “Gräns” is Tina (Eva Melander), a customs officer with a unique, Neanderthal-esque physiognomy that allows her to intuitively “smell” other people’s moral feelings. After Tina unveils a passenger carrying a disk bearing child pornography, she helps the police uncover a ring of pedophiles and human traffickers. Tina’s loneliness is mitigated when she meets Vore (Eoro Milonoff), a similar-looking man who comes to stay in the guest house across from the home she shares with her deadbeat, dog-showing boyfriend, Roland (Jörgen Thorsson). Vore’s appearance, both his physical mien and his presence, finally gratifies Tina’s desperate desire to belong, sympathizing with many of her feelings of inadequacy and uncertainty about her own identity. Yet there is more to Vore than meets the eye, and after Tina learns more about him, she finds herself caught in the midst of a hairy moral dilemma with an equally hairy foot in either world—neither entirely human, nor entirely troll.
Director Ali Abbassi’s Cannes debut, “Gräns,” might not be suited for a mainstream market, but its unconventional plot and impressive acting help mediate its arthouse bizarreness to a wider audience. The end result is, like the film’s protagonist, a strange hybrid of several genres that is one part Swedish noir, one part romance, one part moralistic fable for a film that plays jump rope with the border of what viewers can bear to see on screen.
The vestiges of the film’s Nordic fairytale reference material linger in Abbassi’s cinematic rendering of the natural world, the forested copses and open bodies of water where Vore introduces Tina to the troll way of life, taking her for swims in the lake during rain and literal romps in the mud. After just one day in Vore’s world, Tina is repelled by the prospect of returning to the human world. “I don’t want to live like that anymore,” she says. It’s a no-brainer: Abbassi’s visual, formal choices starkly separate the bloodless, clinical world of Tina’s job as a customs officer from the lush, vegetal landscape of her affair with Vore. And along with this world, Tina is enamored by the man who seems to control it. For insecure, shy Tina, it’s easy to mistake Vore’s selfishness for self-confidence, his physical similarity for sympathy. And the ethical conflict at the center of her struggle is a gripping one. For all the human race’s wrongdoing, Tina finds something redemptive about their world, and the people she has learned to love who inhabit it.
It seems like a simple plot, but Abbassi teases out his film’s capacity for the weird—sometimes to the detriment of his film’s purpose. Tina and Vore’s odd, tongue-heavy kissing and the amount of strange, animalistic grunting are enough to test the limits of comfort for any viewer. A sex scene with a computer-generated erect troll penis probably created more comic relief than Abbassi intended. It was a brave directorial decision on Abbassi’s part to make his characters “other” in a way that was not aesthetically beautiful in a conventional way, but the risk does not pay off when it detracts from its own seriousness, Tina and Vore becoming more caricature than character.
It’s only until the ambiguous ending manages to preserve the film’s artistic integrity that “Gräns” seems to pay off for the rest of its roughly two hour run time. Though a bit narratively unsatisfying, the final scene saves “Gräns” from being an all-out morality fable, adding depth and nuance to Tina’s decision and character. What’s left is an eccentric story about inclusion and belonging, marginalization and otherness, as resonant as it is strange.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In an apartment by the beach, young Elli (Ayline Aksoy-Etaix) lives with her alcoholic mother, Marlene (Marion Cotillard). Elli is precocious and wise beyond her years, but still no older than 10, far too young to play caretaker to her adult mother, whose immaturity and impulsivity effectively renders her a teenage girl, no matter how many times she promises to clean up her act. After another self-destructive bender on a night out (where she shockingly brings Elli), Marlene abandons Elli for a man she just met, leaving her daughter to fend for herself for days, perhaps weeks. During her newfound independence, Elli finds a proxy for parenthood in Julio (Alban Lenoir), the mysterious former cliff diver whose elusive father lives in the apartment next door. In her Cannes debut, French director Vanessa Filho trains a keen eye on the ways girlhood intuitively shapes itself in the image of the mother, no matter how destructive she might be.
Cotillard’s Marlene is not a villain, but a crassly inadequate mother, occupying a space too glittery and too bright to safely be a home to any child—which Filho filmically renders with fractals of light on prismatic glitter and fractured funhouse mirror reflections, images too broken to be whole. Marlene treats Elli less like her daughter and more like an adult friend, or more accurately, like an extension of herself—binge-drinking in front of her, making her over in garish neon lipstick and glittery eye shadow. It’s fun playing dress-up, until it isn’t: “This one’s cute, right?” Marlene says girlishly of the man she is about to go home with, before she puts Elli in a taxi home alone. The sequence of Elli watching her mother flirt through the back window as the taxi leaves the curb is one of the saddest and most heart-rending scenes in the film.
Yet despite her mother’s carelessness and irresponsibility, it’s from observing Marlene that Elli learns about the rites of womanhood, even in a distorted way, which manifests in her disturbing imitation of them during Marlene’s absence—tottering around in Marlene’s oversized heels, haphazardly smearing on neon lipstick, even trying hard liquor on multiple occasions. The image of Elli, nursing a glass of white wine and watching the sunset over her balcony is particularly horrifying, not only because she is alone, or that she is drinking prematurely, but because she is terrifyingly beginning to resemble her mother more and more.
And it’s not only her mother who mistreats Elli. Filho paints a cruelly accurate picture of schoolyard bullying, as the kids at school, who recognize the effects of Elli’s parental neglect as otherness, are quick to attack: “Too much makeup,” one whispers audibly. “She looks like a cougar… A weird clown girl in clown makeup.” Later, they chant in the playground, “Elli, you lose! You stink of booze!”
All this to say, Elli is love-starved in the most pitiful way, clinging onto the nearest person whose presence feels more like care than neglect out of fear that they will leave her. “My mother’s dead,” she whispers conspiratorially to a classmate. “Don’t tell anyone. They throw away kids who are alone.” Until Julio, the men in Elli’s life are either entirely absent, like her father, or abusive, like the boys on the street who hurl lewd epithets about her mother at her as she passes by. One of her male classmates even engages in a micro-prostitute-like exchange, pressing a coin into her hand after she gives him a kiss and a hug in a bathroom stall. It’s cute, in a pathetic kid way, but also emblematic of the toxic notions of sexuality that Elli inherits from her mother.
By comparison, Julio is a prince charming Daddy Warbucks straight out of a fairy tale, who appears across the hallway as if conjured by karmic magic—even a little too perfect, perhaps more transparently a screenwriter’s creation than a full-fledged character. It’s no surprise that Elli instantly recognizes him as a person to trust—so it is all the more heartbreaking when he cannot reciprocate her familial love. “You shouldn’t be here,” he says sternly, when he finds Elli in his trailer home. “I’m not your father. Do you understand?” (In stubborn retaliation, Elli smashes one of his glasses on the floor.) Later, when three schoolboys approach Elli and Julio at an ice cream shop, they taunt her by asking if he’s her father. Elli’s defiant response (“Yeah, he’s my dad”) draws skepticism from the boys, whom Julio scares off. But when Julio turns to her and says, not unkindly, “Elli, why do you lie?” Elli’s shame is palpable: “Sorry,” she mutters, looking away, “sorry.”
As a character, Elli might be merely pitiable, or merely troubled, if not for a breakout performance by young Ayline Aksoy-Etaix. With her wide-eyed stare, Aksoy-Etaix lends a powerful emotional credence to Elli’s resilience, humanizing even the worst of her frustration and tantrums. As expected, Oscar-winning Marion Cotillard is fantastic, if occasionally over-acting the part, and Alban Lenoir gives Julio all the right moves to be Elli’s paternal knight in shining armor. But one gets the feeling that Elli barely needs the backstory or the supporting cast to have her own, compelling adventures. Even at her most upsetting points, she’s fantastic all on her own.
