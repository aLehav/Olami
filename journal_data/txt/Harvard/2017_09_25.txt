After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sept. 12, a crowd gathered in Sanders Theatre to hear Art Spiegelman, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and illustrator, give a lecture entitled “Comix, Jews n’ Art? Dun’t Esk!” The lecture, hosted by The Center for Jewish Studies, took a close look at the art of comics, and its relationship to Judaism, a topic that Spiegelman said he discusses less frequently.
He even acknowledged his reluctance to talk about Judaism or the Holocaust. “I have a feeling I have been outed as a Jew,” he said. Judaism did come up, but as an aid rather than a focus. Spiegelman rattled off lists of Jews in comics, dedicating time especially to his hero Harvey Kurtzman of Mad Magazine. “I studied Mad the way some kids studied the Talmud,” he said. The author explained that comic books were like the “schmatte” —the rag—business, where Jews who had trouble getting into the gentile publishing houses could work.
Some attendees found that the more substantive discussion of Judaism and the Holocaust—the subject of his most famous book, “Maus”—was missing from the lecture. “There are a lot of [...] things that he kind of dodged altogether,” said Ariel R. Hecker ’21, who came to the event for his freshman seminar, “Heretics, Gangsters and Writers.” Hecker said he would have preferred to hear more about “Jewishness in and of itself rather than how Jewishness has affected the comic industry, which seems relatively superficial.”
For others, though, the shifted focus was refreshing. Audrey E. Stewart, a local resident who has studied the Holocaust, explained that Spiegelman’s work was useful to her as she studied Auschwitz. However, she appreciated the chance to approach the work from a different perspective. “I’m not Jewish so I haven’t really thought about American comics through history from the Jewish perspective, so it was nice to see that,” she said.
The crux of Spiegelman’s argument lay in his comparison of Yiddish and comic books. Like Yiddish, Spiegelman said that “comic books are a secular medium that’s a vulgar medium.” Just as Yiddish is cobbled together from several languages, comics are a combination of words and pictures. For Spiegelman, this vulgarity makes both Yiddish and comics more poignant. “It allows it to be supple, to speak with a real voice,” he said.
Spiegelman’s own presentation also embodied that no-nonsense character. The lecture was speckled with jokes, which ranged from a quip about Superman’s tights (“An übermensch who could leap tall buildings in a single bound and yet was circumcised”), to a takedown of Lichtenstein (“He did no more or less for comics than Warhol did for soup”), to political jabs (“If Trump were literate, I would have him read this”). Most jarring were his comments about World War II. “The Holocaust is the broken condom that allowed the birth of Israel,” he said.
In general, Spiegelman did not hesitate to say what he thought. “His character is that he’s provocative,” said Matthew M. Jelen ’21. “That’s just kind of part of the performance, so it was a little uncomfortable at times, but on the whole he had a lot of interesting insights and he’s coming from a very unique perspective.”
Spiegelman’s humor did not stop him from addressing some heavy topics. He argued forcefully for the emotional and even political power of comics. To illustrate this, he showed slides of “Corpse on the Imjin,” a poignant comic by Harvey Kurtzman about the Korean War. Spiegelman also pointed out that the shoes and twisted legs in Phillip Guston’s cartoon paintings alluded to the piled-up bodies of the Holocaust. Guston, born Philip Goldstein, also did political pieces, such as depictions of Nixon and the Klu Klux Klan. “He understands that there is an aspect of the Klan in everyone, including Jews who change their names,” Spiegelman said.
Spiegelman drove home his argument with a discussion of what he called “horror comics,” which depicted the Holocaust. In the aftermath of the war, there was no room for the Holocaust in popular culture, Spiegelman explained, and the horror comics changed that. “The horror comics were bringing to a secular war what had happened and been repressed 10 years before,” he said. Comics, Spiegelman argued, have an honesty and simplicity that made them well suited for this task. “Blank faces allow you to project emotion onto them,” he explained. The horror comics sparked controversy among Jews, some of whom went as far as to burn books.
Lisa E. Rivo, Co-Director at The National Center For Jewish Film, said that Spiegelman left her with a lot to think about. “He’s truly a brilliant man, artist, and thinker so it’s a treat to be able to see him,” she said. “You never know what’s going to happen, and you only know that it’s gonna be poignant and thoughtful, and that it will be personal and the beginning of thinking about the material, not the end.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There is an implicit way to be here—and the here in this case is not some wildly nebulous concept in which the edges are constellational and ever expanding into dark matter, unattainable. No—the here is tangible, neat, an institution like Harvard that inputs scholasticism and dedication, grinds and molds these factors for four years and churns out summa cum laude grist that’s supposed to change the world. Although the diversity of inputs is evermore variable, the same ethical principles underscoring the nature of these students remains stagnant—due diligence to their studies, being just and truthful in the pursuance of their goals, and more. As such, each person is subjected to the same educational mill whose mechanisms are accepted with such fervor by these students, learning to navigate through this system as their hunger for achievement salivates for more.
Everyone graced by this epitomal “here” wants to taste success. Thus, they learn the way to be here; they subject themselves to the hustle and bustle of Harvardian life, hoping to skim to the surface of this higher aim. The University, in turn, utilizes their students’ desires for the future to rhetorically guide the tide of the campus, to build the most faith in the administration and dedication to the policies of the school.
This is not to say that these intentions are not pure in nature. The crux of this relies in understanding why the instinct of University members is to trust that these actions are in accordance with the ethical principles and moral foundations that substantiate their overall goals—not whether or not the message conveyed is wrong or maliciously calculated.
In this simple rhythm of “transformative experiences,” “community,” “home,” “intellectual transformation,” and other cadences of sound, students are serenaded in a choir of hopes and expectations that conveniently align with their personal aspirations. Students and staff alike are then lullaby-ed into a verbal sense of security that is gleaned from what social psychologist Jonathan Haidt defines as their moral foundations, or an innate ethical infrastructure broken into six categories that are utilized to sway reasoning (particularly in religion and politics). Leaning heavily on the ideals of care for others and a universalist loyalty to the community, the University succeeds in pushing a narrative that its members will accept comfortably.
Some might call the response to these serenades almost religious in nature, where there’s a certain higher concept underscoring University rhetoric that students rest their faith and laurels upon. Although the ideals of a Harvard education and the way in which it is obtained are not a straight line from a religious authority to the steps of Widener, this implicit way to be here has a reified tone to it.
Robert Bellah breathed life anew into the term “American civil religion” in a 1976 article, commenting on the way in which presidents past have utilized the aforementioned moral foundations invoked within many religions to bring legitimacy to or incentivize constituents to heed their actions. Harvard officials seem to have adopted this system in a manner similar to past presidents. Yet, the overarching goal at Harvard that gives legitimacy to the hierarchical faith in the system is not a higher being, but in the promise of an unmatched access to a liberal arts education placed on a pedestal.
This tool is wielded carefully: Just as John F. Kennedy ’40, a former Crimson editor, asks for “high standards of strength and sacrifice” in the name of God in his inaugural address, Harvard calls on its students to “serve the world” in having “intellectual… [and] social transformations” in the naming of having an “unparalleled educational journey” in its mission statement. Just as President Obama assures that equality, freedom, and the pursuit of happiness are a “God-given promise,” University President Drew G. Faust uses a similar syntax in her 2017 commencement speech in praising the risks of free speech and being fearless towards possible verbal insult as part of accepting our University’s “values and our theory of education.”
As we continue to abide by and support policies of the administration, we must be wary of the method of communication itself—woven with rhetoric promising the liberal arts and science education of our dreams—morphing into sophistry. Although the beatitude of attending a university like Harvard shines brightly, it can be almost blinding, and that’s when the ability to delineate coaxing rhetoric from subjectivism becomes blurry.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard Management Company recently released its returns for the fiscal year 2017, reporting a return of 8.1 percent and an endowment value of $37.1 billion. While Harvard currently has the largest university endowment in the world, its single-digit returns have been lackluster in comparison, placing Harvard in a worse position than peer institutions and prompting N.P. Narvekar, the new head of HMC, to describe the 8.1 percent return as “disappointing,” blaming “structural problems” within the company.
The endowment, which has been struggling for quite some time, clearly has progress to be made, especially relative to peer schools whose endowments boasted double-digit returns this year. To state the obvious, however, this is an improvement on last year’s $2 billion loss. This is Narvekar’s first year as HMC CEO, and we look forward to his future progress that will hopefully decrease budget constraints that are currently constricting Harvard’s educational and research missions.
Given the context of past underperformance, comparisons between Harvard’s returns and those of comparable schools are easy to draw but do not tell the full story. While it is certainly important that Harvard remains financially competitive, HMC’s significant changes today mean Narvekar deserves more time for his strategy to be judged. We are confident that with the right leadership and strategy, Harvard can return to its position as an investment leader in higher education.
Indeed, Narvekar has already proven himself a dedicated and driven CEO. He has implemented numerous reforms within HMC, including consolidating the number of internal staff members and outsourcing the majority of its assets. We are hopeful that these changes, along with others that remain under consideration, will set HMC up for success in the years to come.
Of course, as we have said before, we are not investment experts. It is our role only to continue to underline the importance of the endowment to Harvard and the seriousness with which we hope President Faust and the Corporation treat underperformance. We are gratified to know that Narvekar has been praised by other financial experts, including the chair of HMC’s Board of Directors, and we are hopeful that he will be able to reverse HMC’s faltering performance.
There are no silver bullets, quick fixes, or easy wins. Rectifying years of underperformance requires a systematic rethink of the endowment. Only over a longer time scale will Harvard be able to reap the benefits of the internal changes currently taking place. We remain cautiously optimistic about the state of Harvard’s financial returns and anxiously await continued improvement.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While visiting family members shortly after I got into Harvard, my friend texted me angrily about a comment that her uncle had made after learning that I had been admitted but his son had not. He asked my friend for my SAT scores, which she did not know, and claimed I only got in because I was Latina.
I’ve gotten the requests for scores countless times. I’ve gotten the magical question of why I think I got into Harvard. I gave tours through the Admissions Office over the summer. It was my job to answer these questions. I got different feelings depending on who was asking. From prospective students, I felt a need to affirm their own statistics as they began their application process. From parents, I felt a need to affirm them that their kid could get in. But along with it, I felt like they wanted me to prove their suspicions right. After looking at average scores and GPA’s that had been publicized, I felt like they wanted my scores to see if they were as low as they expected them to be.
But we are not here to prove ourselves. We are not here to present our stats. The opponents can’t possibly fathom that maybe it’s easier to do better academically when your school is not underfunded and your parents can afford to pay for tutors and college counselors. Maybe it’s easier when you don’t have to constantly hear and see slanders about people who look like you. Maybe it’s easier to do well when your community is not constantly criminalized because of the melanin you carry with you wherever you go.
That never gets taken into account. The main thing that matters here is race. Not to mention that the people who have benefitted the most from affirmative action are not racial minorities—they’re white women.
I am not here to argue for affirmative action. At this point, it seems like a useless fight. You’d think after so many years, people would finally understand the need. At this point, I can’t really do much to change the minds of those people who believe they were wronged when they didn’t get accepted to a school that has a 5 percent acceptance rate. I can’t do much to silence the attacks that have been made by the opponents of affirmative action, the attacks that I have been on the receiving end of time and time again from strangers and my own classmates.
This is not for them. They do not deserve to keep getting attention for their ignorant beliefs. No. This is for the incoming students here who will receive their hatred.
You are all so much more than what they think you are. You are strong and resilient and have earned your place here. They will try to tell you otherwise, but I am here to make sure you know that you deserve to be here. These institutions were not made for us. They were designed by the people in power for the people in power.
But we are trying to change that. We must create our spaces here. You must take ownership of your identities and be proud knowing that you made it so far despite all the circumstances that stood in your way—circumstances that they are strangers to. They assume that the darker you are, the farther you fall below the average scores for the College. They don’t realize that life is more than just GPAs and test scores.
You have several communities available for you at this school. You don’t have to listen to the rhetoric that people spew without knowing anything about you. They try to paint your narratives in a single color that they view with disgust. But they don’t know what it’s like to be you. They have not lived your life and have not witnessed your hard work and your successes. They don’t realize that there will be many more to come.

Students and faculty in the Music department celebrated changes to the department’s undergraduate curriculum with a musicology exhibit in the Houghton Library this month.
The library and Music department partnered to host an exhibit about the life and the work of Guido Adler, a pioneer in the field of musicology. It opened on Sept. 11 and runs through Dec. 19.
Documents showcased at the exhibit came to Harvard in 2015 from the University of Vienna. Adler’s academic papers were seized by Austrian Nazis after his death in 1941 and remained in the University’s library until 2004, when a project to return stolen property to the descendants of Austrian Holocaust survivors began.
At the time, Harvard’s Music faculty pushed to acquire the documents, many of which are being displayed for the first time.
In March, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences approved a new Music curriculum for undergraduate concentrators that decreases the number of courses concentrators must take and makes more courses eligible for concentration credit.
Christina Linklater, who curated the exhibits at the Houghton and Loeb libraries, said that Adler’s work is powered by the kind of musical exploration that changes to the curriculum encourage.
“I think that Adler is an emblem for the new curriculum. Adler was a polymath—because no one had done musicology before there were no limits,” Linklater said. “He embraced world music, ancient music, the music of contemporary Vienna. There really wasn’t anything he wasn’t at least slightly interested in.”
Under the new curriculum, concentrators no longer have to take several theory and music history requirements, and may now count more performance-based classes for credit.
Music professor Anne C. Shreffler said the new curriculum allows students to “broaden their horizons” in the field, and better reflects concentrators’ diverse musical backgrounds.
“People really wanted to get credit. Not just course credit, but to get acknowledgement of their efforts as musicians and as performers,” Schreffler said.
Music professor Alexander Rehding added that while the old curriculum “had a fair amount of expectations that were ideally met by prior education,” the new curriculum is “more inclusive.” He added that many students without prior experience and training were likely excluded from the Music concentration under the old system.
For students, the changes are largely welcome.
Austin Weber ’19, a joint Music-Visual and Environmental Studies concentrator, said he hopes the changes will bring more people into the department, which currently houses 20 undergraduates.
“I feel like everyone should have the opportunity to take a music class at Harvard. Too few people engage with the Music department,” Weber said. “There’s a trend towards less of a focus on the classical conservatory-style teaching, but it’s still offered for people who want to do it.”
Schreffler added that many concentrators feel similar to Weber.
“I personally have heard only positive comments so far from students,” she said.
The documents on display include an autographed Gustav Mahler symphony, a letter from Adler to New York Times music critic Richard Aldrich, and his transposition of a 15th century song using modern musical notation.

Though same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide in 2015, the country continues to see legal conflicts between religious liberty and BGLTQ rights, Wayne State University professor John F. Corvino argued at the Law School Friday.
A BGLTQ rights activist and philosophy scholar, Corvino discussed cases like the 2012 Masterpiece Cakeshop case, in which a baker refused to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple because of his religious convictions. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case during its upcoming term, raising new questions about religious liberty and discrimination.
“I don’t think of it in terms of distinctions between religious liberty and discrimination. The concern was cases where religious liberty might justify discrimination,” Corvino stated.
Corvino argued that if businesses were granted a religious exemption to anti-discrimination laws when it came to refusing wedding cakes for same-sex couples, it could easily create a “slippery slope” where they could begin refusing other products as well. He cautioned against religious exemptions becoming what he called “state-sanctioned discrimination.”
Delineating what constitutes free speech versus discrimination, Corvino argued there was a difference between refusing service based on the product and refusing service based on the customer. The former, he said, would be the business’s freedom to choose their products, while the latter would be discrimination against certain buyers.
Corvino added that the United States is a nation that takes religion seriously: In addition to being an important part of the country’s constitutional tradition, he said, it has proven to be a site of conflict, often stirring disagreements over religion’s influence on governmental policies.
In response to this discord, Corvino proposed ways to begin meaningful discourse on religious liberty, as opposed to dismissing people as “bigots.”
“Calling [people] ‘bigots’ functions as a kind of conversation stopper, often precisely at the moment when we need more conversation,” he said.
As a step towards meaningful discourse, Corvino suggested creating relationships between the parties that disagree.
“When you build those relationships, you then create the level of trust that allows you to enter into a deeper dialogue, so that you’re not just defensively putting forth talking points for fear of losing the argument,” Corvino noted.

Michelle L. Kim ’18 is nostalgic for freshman year.
The senior isn’t eager to go back to the days of getting lost on campus or lugging laundry across Harvard Yard. Instead, she said she’s hoping to restore the sense of community she experienced as a freshman by assuming the role of senior class marshal.
Kim is one of 36 seniors who announced their candidacy for the position last week. Over the weekend, candidates began reaching out to their peers by launching Facebook events and reconnecting with old acquaintances. First, second, and program marshals will be selected this week through two rounds of elections, the first of which begins Monday.
The Senior Class Committee operates with the goal of “connecting members of the Class of 2018 to each other” and “modeling and facilitating communication, participation, volunteerism, and philanthropy among classmates,” according to the Harvard Alumni Association, through which the Committee is run. Class marshals and other members of the Committee plan class events and arrange the Senior Gift, among other activities.
Many of this year’s candidates say they are running for marshal to restore a sense of camaraderie that they feel has been missing since freshman year.
This disconnect was especially apparent to Kim, who upon returning to campus after studying abroad in Amsterdam last spring, said she felt like a first-year student again but missed the enthusiasm for new people and experiences that she encountered in the Yard.
“My platform is essentially having a freshman mentality,” Kim said.
Camille N’Diaye-Muller ’18 said she would also like to see members of her class become better acquainted.
“I want to connect people, who because of life, interests, and different concentrations haven’t had a chance to meet,” she said.
Another candidate, Charles S. Krumholz ’18, said recent events have played a role in the degradation of a sense of community. Citing “an extremely polarizing political climate,” and “many different policies that have been controversial across campus and the wider world,” he said he believes Harvard has become a divided place.
“The class of 2018 has to realize our identity as one class that should be united and respect each other,” Krumholz said.
While many candidates have been brainstorming fun activities for the class, Sara M. Surani ’18 has developed a three-tier strategy to bring seniors together.
“I want to focus on the community level, the interpersonal level, and the personal level,” Surani said.
If elected, she said she plans to look beyond the Committee’s typical class-wide events by arranging several smaller events events like self-reflection workshops.
Though voting for class marshals begins Monday, many candidates said they weren’t overly stressed by campaigning.
N’Diaye-Muller said she’s taking a “laissez-faire” approach to campaigning, as she believes most people already know who they’ll be voting for.
Michael J. Sanky ’18 also plans on taking it easy with an occasional Facebook post and word-of-mouth outreach.
“Campaign efforts aren’t necessarily a representation of how much effort that candidate [would] put into the actual senior programming,” he said.
The first and second marshal positions will be filled by the two candidates that receive the most votes, with the next six top candidates appointed as program marshals. Results of the election will be released on Friday.

UPDATED: September 27, 2017 at 5:24 p.m.
Harvard University Health Services may refer students to remote counseling through a partnership with telemedicine company iHope Network.
The partnership comes after a pilot launch in the spring for students on Harvard's Longwood campus. iHope allows patients around the world to access to therapists during non-business hours by conducting sessions remotely over phone or video conferencing. While HUHS will sometimes refer students to iHope, interested students also have the option of contacting the company directly to set up an appointment.
Any person with the Student Health Insurance Plan can use iHope. Those on their parents’ insurance will have to check with their insurance provider to see if iHope is covered.
Although HUHS is referring students to iHope’s services, Chief of Counseling and Mental Health Services Barbara Lewis emphasized that HUHS’s regular counseling services were still available and that iHope was “probably not our first choice unless we have a student who potentially really needs to have someone in the evening and they haven't been able to find anyone locally.”
Steven Locke, Chief Medical Officer and co-founder of iHope Network, said he first had the idea to partner with Harvard about a year ago after reading an article about high rates of depression and suicidal ideation among medical students. Locke said he reached out to Dean for Medical Education Edward M. Hundert, who then introduced him to Paul J. Barriera, the director of HUHS.
“[Barreira] was very interested in what we were doing and so we met with him and had several meetings with him and the staff and the behavioral health leadership,” Locke said, “And that’s how we got started.”
Tom Hunter, Chief Executive Officer of iHope Network, said the service’s flexible scheduling and reliance on telecommunication technology offers several advantages to students. iHope offers counseling early in the morning and late at night, which “can be the difference between being able to see a therapist at all or not,” according to Hunter.
In the past, some students have called the process of waiting for an in-person mental health counseling session discouraging. iHope’s increased accessibility may present a solution to this problem.
“We want to make people aware of this as an option because for many people, getting to a brick and mortar office is difficult,” Hunter said.
Hunter also said that iHope allows students more privacy and increases accessibility for people with mobility issues because they do not have to leave their dorm room to receive counseling.
iHope also has partnerships with several other colleges in Massachusetts and is working to expand their reach.
Still, Lewis said that only a few Harvard students had been referred to iHope since the start of the semester.
“I think what's happening now and the reason why we haven't had as many referrals in these first few weeks of school is because students are opting to come in and see us or find someone in the community,” Lewis said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard is “reviewing” new federal Title IX guidance—released last week by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos—cancelling an Obama-era requirement that colleges use the lowest standard of proof when judging whether an accused student is guilty of sexual assault.
DeVos announced the policy change in a press conference Friday afternoon, saying universities are now free to abandon that standard—known as “preponderance of the evidence”—and instead adopt a higher standard, “clear and convincing evidence.” In a statement Sunday, University Title IX Officer Nicole M. Merhill wrote that “the Title IX Office and Office for Dispute Resolution know of no current plan to change the standard of evidence” after DeVos’s statement.
Former President Barack Obama issued the guidelines DeVos scrapped Friday in a 2011 “Dear Colleague” letter. That letter, which also demanded universities treat sexual assault as a violation of Title IX, spurred Harvard—and institutions across the country—to completely rethink its response to sexual assault cases. The University in 2014 created a central office to investigate sexual violence on campus and embraced all-new Title IX policies, including the “preponderance of evidence” standard.
DeVos’s shift in federal guidelines would allow Harvard to raise its standard of proof while not running afoul of the government, though it does not mandate the change.
“We are reviewing the guidance released by the Department of Education...rescinding guidance from 2011,” University spokesperson Tania deLuzuriaga wrote in an emailed statement Sunday afternoon. “We have worked hard in recent years to develop strong and fair policies.”
“The safety and well-being of our community remains the University’s top priority,” she added.
Anti-sexual assault advocacy student group Our Harvard Can Do Better condemned DeVos’s announcement in a statement issued Sunday evening and called on Harvard to take action.
“Harvard must clarify that changes to our policy made since the 2011 guidelines and subsequent opening of a Title IX investigation against the University—including the adoption of the preponderance of the evidence standard—will not be rolled back," organizers Amelia Y. Goldberg ’19 and Liam L. McGill ’19 wrote in the statement.
Administrators have previously said Harvard is unlikely to alter its current Title IX enforcement strategy. In a February 2017 interview just before DeVos was confirmed as Education Secretary, Deputy Provost Peggy E. Newell promised any “relaxation in requirements” from the White House would not diminish the University’s commitment to solving issues of sexual assault.
But should new requirements “come down,” Newell added, Harvard will “obviously comply” with federal policy.
In her speech rescinding the Obama-era guidelines Friday, DeVos did not offer a replacement policy. Instead, she said she plans to debut new rules after a months-long public comment period—until then, colleges are free to use whichever standard of proof they prefer.
“The government has literally at this point said, ‘We’re agnostic on this issue, you can have either one,’” said Scott D. Schneider, a Tulane University professor and attorney who specializes in higher education law.
Schneider said he does not think “anything” will change at Harvard following DeVos’s decision, adding he believes the University is unlikely to raise its standard of evidence “right now.”
Other Title IX experts took the opposite view. Colby Bruno, the senior legal counsel at the Victim Rights Law Center, and Vanessa M. Grigoriadis, who recently wrote a book on campus sexual assault, both said they think Harvard may upgrade its standard of proof.
“I think Harvard is probably the first place that will change it,” Bruno said. “Harvard was one of the last standouts to institute ‘preponderance of the evidence,’ so it wouldn’t surprise me if Harvard went back to a ‘clear and convincing’ standard.’”
Grigoriadis agreed, adding she also “would not be surprised” if Harvard returns to the higher standard. Both women cited pressure from high-profile Law School professors who think poorly of the University’s 2014 Title IX policies as a major reason Harvard might make the change.
In October 2014, three months after Harvard debuted its new Title IX procedures, 28 Law School professors signed an open letter condemning the policy and calling for its withdrawal. In their letter, the professors took particular issue with the lower standard of proof.
Harvard has faced federal scrutiny over its compliance with Title IX before; in 2014, the Law School was found in violation of the law, and the College is currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights.
A committee of professors, students, and staff continues to review Harvard’s Title IX approach.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Two members of the legal team that settled a lawsuit earlier this year against the psychologists who designed and implemented a Central Intelligence Agency torture program spoke Friday afternoon at the Law School about their work on the landmark case.
Paul L. Hoffman—a civil and human rights lawyer and lecturer at the Law School—and criminal defense lawyer Lawrence S. Lustberg played major roles on the American Civil Liberties Union’s litigation team in Salim v. Mitchell, filed on behalf of three former CIA detainees. The case accused two psychologists, James E. Mitchell and John B. Jessen, of designing “cruel, inhuman” interrogation techniques that were used against detainees Suleiman A. Salim, Mohamed A. Ben Soud, and Gul Rahman in secret CIA prisons.
The case, which was settled in August, is one of the most high-profile attempts to date to hold the U.S. government accountable for using techniques considered to be torture in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
“Numerous detainees have filed lawsuits challenging torture by the US government. Mr. Salim, Mr. Ben Soud were the first ones to ever have their case get this far, get to the eve of trial, get to a settlement,” Lustberg said. “Nobody had ever entered into a settlement with a CIA operative before in the history of the nation.”
More broadly, Lustberg said, the case illustrated the tension in public interest litigation between a client’s best interest and a litigation team’s cause.
“For the ACLU, it would have been a been a better thing for the case to go to trial; it would have been on the front page of The New York Times everyday,” Lustberg said. “For the clients, for whom this is a very difficult process, and who stood to reap the benefits of the settlement...it was their choice. That is a classic part of public interest litigation,” he added.
Lustberg also said that while the Obama administration was supportive of transparency regarding state interrogation techniques in this case, the Trump administration may be less so for future, similar cases.
“I expect that we’re in for a tough time period in terms of these sorts of techniques,” Lustberg said in an interview after the event. “On the other hand, what Salim v. Mitchell stands for is that if you do that, you do that by your peril.“
During a question and answer portion of the event, an audience member asked the lawyers whether their clients’ views of the country had changed since the case.
“Our clients were not anti-American before, and they’re not anti-American now,” Hoffman responded.
Elvina Pothelet, a visiting researcher at the Law School, said she was impressed with the obstacles the litigators surmounted in arguing the case to a settlement.
“It gives hope that this kind of case can find their way to the courts,” she said.
Lindsay A. Bailey, a second-year Law student, agreed.
“It’s inspiring to hear about the cases that are a win, because we take a lot of losses in the human rights litigation field,” she said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The 36th Undergraduate Council passed its annual budget with a new fund for representatives to finance campus-wide initiatives, following two hours of discussion and three failed amendments Sunday evening.
At the meeting—the first including representatives from the Class of 2021—UC members proposed six amendments to its $678,466 annual budget. Only three passed.
The UC’s final budget allocated $385,000 towards funding undergraduate student groups—its largest expenditure—and $159,080 to fund activities in the upperclassmen Houses. For the first time this year, the UC’s Education Committee was allocated its own budget of $1,000.
Most of this year’s budget came from the College’s Student Activities Fee, an optional $75 fee that undergraduates pay annually. This year, students’ fees contributed a total of $501,075 to the budget.
Several amendments revolved around the new fund, called the Burst Fund, which originally offered UC  members and committees to apply for ten “packs” of $6,000 to jumpstart initiatives that benefit the College’s student body.
Nicholas D. Boucher ’19, the Council’s treasurer, said the Burst Fund differs from past budget items like the Council’s Crazy Idea Fund and Grant for an Open Harvard College in that it funds a wider range of initiatives and activities. The Crazy Fund, created in 2015, contained less money than the Burst Fund, while GOHC only funds initiatives in five policy areas: race, culture, and faith relations, mental health, sexual assault and harassment, social spaces, and financial accessibility.
“There are a lot of different things this could be used for, but the idea is...that you can claim one of these ten funds and use it for whatever project you’re working on,” Boucher said.
At the meeting, UC Vice President Cameron K. Khansarinia ’18, Mather House representative Eduardo A. Gonzalez ’18, and Quincy House representative Sarah S. Fellman ’18 proposed successful amendments regulating the ways in which the Burst Fund may be allocated.
Khansarinia’s amendment requires two-thirds approval of  in order to approve a pack, Gonzalez’s amendment requires Burst Fund-sponsored events to be open to all College students and have partially subsidized tickets, and Fellman’s divides the Burst Fund into 20 packs of $3,000 dollars instead of 10 packs of $6,000.
Also at the meeting, the UC’s Executive Committee announced creation of the Council’s First-Generation and Low-Income Caucus and Women’s Caucus were announced. Furthermore, Adam E. Harper ’20 was appointed to be the Chair of the Freshmen Class Committee and Jungyeon Park ’20 was appointed to the Student Faculty Committee.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
UPDATED: September 25, 2017 at 6:10 p.m.
A University-wide task force focused on diversity and inclusion recommended Monday that central administrators work with individual schools to devise plans to ensure historically marginalized groups experience “full membership in the Harvard community.”
That recommendation was one of several the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging, which University President Drew G. Faust convened in 2016, released Monday morning in a draft version of the report's executive summary. The draft asks the University to review its values statement to reflect the “Shared Standards,” proposes that schools integrate an “Inclusion and Belonging Module” into periodic climate surveys, and asks the University to increase funding for efforts to diversify the faculty and review promotion processes.
The draft also suggests creating centers for “Identity, Politics, and Culture” and “Inclusion and Belonging” to advance scholarship on these topics.
And to oversee it all, the summary calls on the Office of the President and Provost to designate a central administrator focusing on diversity and inclusion “across all three constituencies of students, staff, and academic personnel.”
“Our campus community must strive to recognize each person’s inherent dignity, foster each person’s potential, and promote the bonds and bridges that allow us to support each other, to grow with each other, and to learn from each other, including through disagreement,” the document reads.
 The draft is the first iteration of the group’s final product, which the task force now intends to unveil earlier than expected after Faust announced she would step down next June. Faust convened the task force last September, a year after a College working group called for such a group’s formation. Their charge: evaluating Harvard’s demographics, institutional culture, academic resources, and existing organizational structures.
Over the course of the last year, the 46-person task force—co-chaired by Government professor Danielle S. Allen, Kennedy School professor Archon Fung, and Vice President for Campus Services Meredith L. Weenick—collected input from leaders and Harvard affiliates from every school and “business unit,” such as HUIT and Human Resources. Many discussions, a day-long retreat, and a majority vote culminated in the nine-page report the task force made public Monday morning.
“Despite the best efforts of so many good people, we have heard many stories from across campus recounting obstacles to personal, professional, and intellectual thriving—some emerging from interpersonal dynamics, some from institutional structures, some from our decentralized organization, some from the geographic separation of our campuses,” the draft reads. “We recommend that a set of shared standards for inclusive excellence be adopted throughout the University.”
These “shared standards” include a commitment to proactively recruiting diverse candidates, fostering a culture of “engaging across difference,” and ensuring “our symbols and communications will convey the openness and accessibility to all our campus and of an academic life.”
The draft also lays out a set of recommendations addressed to Faust, and notes “specifically what the office of the President and Provost can do to support this work.”
At a school known for its decentralization, deans of individual schools hold significant sway over the inner workings of their respective schools. The task force intended its recommendations to be broad enough to give each school the leeway to craft its own approach to implementing them.
“I’m certain there will be some discussion as to what do these recommendations mean, but I think at least it’s a helpful starting point, as opposed to sort of throwing it up in the air and saying ‘we’d like the school to be like this,’ in a very vague way,’” Law School Dean of Students Marcia Sells, a task force member, said.
The report calls on schools to formulate strategic plans, report back to central administrators annually, and address each of the 14 standards listed in the report in the next five years. The task force recommends that the University adopt the standards as a “core management tool” and “publish a biennial assessment of University progress of diversity, inclusion, and belonging.”
As part of the “Shared Standards,” the report encourages “responsive curricula” that “appropriately serve the diverse array of intellectual interests brought to the table by members of the campus community.”
Yet the task force shied away from explicitly endorsing an ethnic studies academic programs—a flashpoint in campus activism for over four decades.
“That’s a College-level question again. That’s a perfect example of a school policy that we are just not going to make a recommendation one way or another on,” Allen said. “Our hope is that the framework we’re offering would give the College a kind of foundation for thinking that through.”
Allen pointed to the proposal for two centers as the task force’s attempt to address concerns about discrepancies in academic offerings. But there was internal debate among task force members, and task force member William Oh ’18 said the decision to leave out ethnic studies was not unanimous.
“I’m very curious and I’m hoping students and supporters of ethnic studies will push for more clarification and stronger language around that recommendation,” Oh said. “This [report] is not representative of the entire task force.”
The task force’s recommendations are addressed to a University president who is on her way out—and members hope the committee searching for her replacement will prioritize candidates who will turn their vision to reality.
“I would hope that the people in the selection committee include this in some way as a way of evaluating who will be the next president,” Sells said. “I hope that they introduce it to the people who are looking for an opportunity to lead Harvard.”
Allen said she and her co-chairs intend to meet with the Corporation in the coming months “in the hope of the Corporation sort of putting this set of recommendations on the to-do list of the incoming president.”
In the meantime, Allen said she hopes Faust will begin implementing some of the task force’s suggestions next spring. She hopes that Faust will begin to revise the University’s value statement and “give thought to” improving the recruitment of diverse staff teams.
The task force has already begun taking steps to alter some of Harvard’s historic symbols. Last April, Allen announced a competition to change the last line of “Fair Harvard,” the University’s alma mater. She said the group has received around 160 entries to date.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
After opening its season against a variety of nonconference opponents, No.16 Harvard field hockey (6-2; 1-0 Ivy) traveled to New Haven, Conn., this past Saturday to face off against Yale. In a thrilling overtime battle, the Crimson left victorious, beating the Bulldogs 2-1.
The team then returned home on Sunday to face off against Lafayette (5-4, 1-1). After falling behind 1-0 early on, Harvard rallied to score six unanswered goals to seal its victory.
No. 16 Harvard 6, Lafayette 1
The Crimson returned home on Sunday to face off against a tough opponent in Lafayette. Although the Leopards dropped its previous two contests heading into Saturday, it remained a team known for its strong defensive presence. Coming into the weekend, Lafayette had conceded an average of 1.1 goals per game, so the Crimson knew that scoring goals would be no easy task.
After a stalemate for the first twenty minutes, the Leopards scored the game’s opening goal in the 25th minute. Despite falling behind, Harvard’s offense ultimately took over, as the team scored six unanswered goals to close the game. The team’s first goal came in the 27th minute, as sophomore midfielder Bente van Vlijmen gathered a blocked shot and fired a reverse stick shot into the top corner of the net. In the 32nd minute, freshman forward Mimi Tarrant played a pass to sophomore forward Maddie Earle, whose shot from close sailed into the net. Hannah Pearce closed off the half for the Crimson by scoring off of a penalty corner.
The second half saw Harvard continue its offensive onslaught. In a beautiful run, junior forward Kathleen Young saw her shot from a wide angle beat the Lafayette goalkeeper. The goal extends Young’s scoring streak to five games. Over the course of those five games, she has racked up ten points, scoring four goals and tallying two assists.
In the 66th minute, van Vlijmen scored her second goal of the day off a straightaway shot. Junior back Olivia Allin scored Harvard’s final goal in the 68thh minute off of a penalty corner. With the result, senior goalkeeper Olivia Startup improves to 4-0 in her four starts this season. Additionally, Harvard has now won its past four contests, beating its opponents by a combined 18-5 margin.
“We always want to treat every game with the same intensity regardless of whether it’s in conference or out of conference” Startup said. “In particular, these nonconference games are very important to our national ranking. Having such a tough weekend, we wanted to come out with a really strong win to cap off our performance”.
No. 16 Harvard 2, Yale 1 (OT)
The Crimson opened Ivy league play by traveling to New Haven to face off against Yale. The contest didn’t begin as Harvard would have hoped, as Yale scored the game’s opening goal twenty minutes into the contest. From that point on, Harvard dominated the action, finishing with 28 shots to the Bulldog’s 8. However, the team was unable to translate those shots into the goal it needed for much of the game. The team, having been in similar situations earlier this season, knew that it didn’t need to panic; it just needed to focus on its plan.
“Every Ivy game does hold a little more weight, but we always focus on ourselves”, Wellington said. “We view it as just the next game; just the next problem that we’re going to tackle as a team. We know that when we can play our game, there is no team that we can’t beat”.
In a late attempt to save the game, Harvard pulled junior goalkeeper Libby Manela with just over five minutes to play in regulation. The team responded with a flurry, particularly in the final minute. In the 70th minute, van Vlijmen shot her penalty corner, but saw it blocked. However, Young was able to secure the rebound and beat the Yale goalkeeper to tie the game and send it into overtime. This occasion marks the second time this season Harvard has forced overtime on a last minute goal, the first coming in its matchup with then No. 13 Stanford on September 4.
In overtime, the Crimson continued with its relentless attack. Five minutes into overtime, van Vlijmen fired a shot, but once again saw it blocked. This time however, freshman midfielder Tessel Huibregtsen corralled the rebound and scored the winning goal. The goal was Huibregtsen’s first of her collegiate career. With the result, Harvard has now won its last ten Ivy league games dating back to the 2015 season. Additionally, the Crimson has won five straight against Yale.
“We were really happy with the result”, Startup said. “It’s a great way to start off Ivies. We conceded the first goal against Yale and Lafayette, but we were resilient and we kept playing out game without getting phased. Being able to come back, even so late in the game, gives us a lot of positives to take away”.
Following this weekend’s contests, Harvard returns to action on Wednesday, when it travels to Holy Cross. The team then returns home to face off against Penn at home on Saturday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
An attendance battle might be in the making this season between Harvard basketball at Lavietes Pavilion and the women’s volleyball team at the Malkin Athletic Center.
That was because an exhilarating sell-out crowd filled the stands of the Crimson’s  (6-4, 1-0 Ivy League) Ivy League opener against Dartmouth (4-6, 0-1 Ivy League) to witness the home team’s 3-1 victory. The energy of the hometown fans, many of whom were forced to stand on the second floor railing, was a sight to be admired on Friday night.
“I was really happy with how we played today,” sophomore blocker Maclaine Fields said, “It was important to come out strong for a first game in the Ivy League and show everyone what kind of team we are. I was happy with the grit that we all showed and seeing it all come together was amazing.”
The first timeout of the game was called quickly in set one, after Harvard sprinted to a 15-5 lead. The Big Green looked was sloppier in its execution, and an impressive 10 digs prior to the first timeout by the Crimson quickly generated solid opportunities for Harvard.
The Crimson offense relied heavily on softer dinks and strategic ball positioning in order to evade the Dartmouth frontline, led by freshman Tola Akinwumi and sophomore Carly Tower.
Off a set-high five kills by Fields, the Crimson barrelled through the remainder of the set. Dartmouth was simply outmatched and only pulled out 12 points, along with four attack errors and four reception errors.
“We have worked so incredibly hard in practice,” junior co-captain Christina Cornelius said, “It feels like everything is gelling for us, from hitting to digging to setting. We are still feeling each other out but for the first game it was a great start.”
Cornelius and Fields were Harvard’s two main attacking targets for the game, and the two both finished with double-digit kill marks. A final kill tally of 18 was remarkably a career-high for Cornelius, who was complemented by sophomore setter Erin McCarthy’s 46 assists.
“I felt like me and Erin really clicked today,” Cornelius said, “ I want to do as much as I can on and off the court. Today I was just seeing spots open and Erin was setting me really well so I think that was how it happened.”
The Big Green finally woke up in the second set and jumped out to a 8-5 lead, forcing Harvard to call its first timeout.
The Crimson kept the set within reaching distance, and two straight kills along with a reception error in the middle of the set brought the set back to a 15-15 tie game.
But sloppy play by Harvard near the end of the set allowed Dartmouth to pull away, with a 25-19 final set score enough to temper the early enthusiasm built by the Crimson.
However, Harvard bounced back from the second set with a 7-2 run to start the third set.
The eighth point for the Crimson involved a little piece of trickery as McCarthy earned a rare kill. Recognizing that the Big Green was flat-footed as it awaited a spike from one of the Harvard wings, McCarthy brilliantly flicked the ball directly over the net into the unsuspecting Dartmouth line. This was just McCarthy’s second kill in the past three games.
This piece of magic energized the rest of the Crimson, allowing the team to ensuingly carry the lead into the middle of the set.
Despite a close end to the set, Harvard ultimately would edge Dartmouth 25-23 for the third set victory.
In the fourth and final set, the Crimson jumped out to an early lead, and maintained around a four-point spread for much of the frame. Cornelius earned five of her 18 kills in this set, and the rest of the team complemented her with eight more as the home team earned the 25-20 victory.
Overall, Harvard continued its dominant streak against their neighbors from New Hampshire, carrying over from last year.  The Crimson defeated the Big Green with easy 3-0 and 3-1 wins in its two games last season, a season in which The Big Green struggled mightily against Ivy League opponents last year with just two Ancient Eight victories.
Regardless of such numbers, Harvard sees this game as an important building block for the rest of the season, one in which Ivy League championship aspirations will certainly be in play.
“I felt it was a complete team effort today,” Fields said. “I was really happy with how everyone stepped up and lead our offense and defense from all angles. It was definitely a great win for us.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s soccer team entered Saturday’s Ivy League opener against Penn riding a four-game win streak against the Quakers. From the very beginning of the contest, however, it was clear that Penn had come to play with the intent of breaking that streak.
The visiting Quakers  (2-5-2, 1-0-0 Ivy) tested Crimson (6-4-0, 0-1-0) junior goalie Danielle Etzel early and often, forcing two saves from her early in the game. Then, on the third attempt, they finally broke through.
In the 30th minute, Penn sophomore forward Emma Loving collected a pass from junior defender Camillia Nwokedi on the right side of the 18-yard box and unleashed a powerful low shot across the face of goal. The ball skipped past Etzel’s outstretched arms and into the back of the net for Penn’s first goal against Harvard since 2013.
Loving’s well-placed finish turned out to be enough for the Quakers to break their hex against the Crimson. In fact, the 1-0 score line marked Penn’s first victory in Cambridge, Mass. since 2007, a full decade ago. In terms of this season’s results, the win also snapped the Quakers’ eight game winless streak.
“The Ivy League’s a whole new season, and it doesn’t matter what records the teams come in with,” Harvard coach Chris Hamblin said. “We all start with a clean slate and Penn capitalized on their chances today while we didn’t.”
On the whole, the Crimson did create more scoring opportunities than its opponents. Star midfielder Leah Mohammadi was contained in the final third for the most part, but her teammates stepped up as seven different Harvard players recorded a shot on goal. Even after the junior left the pitch with an injury early in the second half, the Crimson continued to improve on offense.
One of Mohammadi’s midfield partners, junior Zayne Matulis, took the team’s best chance of the afternoon when she struck a free kick from distance in the 72nd minute. The ball dipped under the crossbar at the last moment, forcing Quakers sophomore goalie Kitty Qu to make a sprawling save and tip it over the bar.
It was Qu’s finest save of the match, but far from her only crucial stop as she collected seven saves in total.
“Their defense was tough, but it was more so on us [in] failing to execute,” said Harvard senior midfielder Dani Stollar. “We struggled to find the right touches, to do the simple, technical things in the final third, and that’s something we’ll have to look at and work on.”
On the other side, Penn did find the all-important breakthrough. The goal by Loving was a culmination of the Quakers’ ability all game to send dangerous passes into the box. Sophomore midfielder Emily Sands was particularly instrumental in this offensive scheme, as she constantly created chances for others. The 2016 All-Ivy selection added a team-high two shots on goal as well.
Defensively, Penn slowed the Crimson offense with its tight positioning. In particular, freshmen defenders Chase Geffert and Jadyn Wilensky showed how far they have come in their first season by playing the full 90 minutes and helping the Quakers repel every attack. Geffert, standing at 5’11’’, was vital as Harvard threatened with 10 corners over the course of the game.
“They’re a physical team, and we knew coming in that they would be bigger,” Hamblin said. “That’s just the nature of our team right now, more technical, and we knew we wanted to keep the ball on the ground more. It came down to Penn dictating the game better and forcing us to play to their style.”
In the end, the Crimson can only wonder what if as it looks back on its 10 corner kick opportunities. The team did try to play short corners several times, but the Quaker defense held tight each time.
“It definitely hurts to start the season this way,” Stollar said. “We started a little too slow today and we weren’t able to come all the back even as we grew into the game. But it’s still early in the season, and anything can happen.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Battling the elements as well as some of the top programs in the country, the Harvard men’s and women’s cross country teams had a strong showing on Friday at the 2017 Coast to Coast Battle in Beantown.
The meet took place at the Crimson’s home course, Franklin Park, located in between Dorchester and Jamaica Plain in Boston. Competing against a strong lineup of other schools from around the nation, the men’s team finished 11th out of the 18 teams represented, with a score of 288 in the 8 kilometer race. On the women’s side, Harvard took home ninth out of a total of 22 schools, competing in the women’s 5K race, racking up 271 points along the way.
For the men’s team, three freshman led the way. In his first career NCAA race, Hugo Milner finished in 19th with a time of 24:46. The next top individual performers were Matthew Pereira and Michael Albers, who crossed the line at 25:34 and 25:38 respectively. The Crimson’s fourth finisher, was Tyler Spear, a senior and team veteran, who clocked in at 25:40. Harvard’s top five finishers all finished within 1:01 of one another, showing the consistency possessed by the team.
“We were led by a really strong contingent of freshmen,” Spear said. “We were very happy with where we were yesterday. It was a step in the right direction. We had some incredible runs from a lot of the guys. We want to keep taking good steps forward and keep developing some of the younger guys.”
In the women’s race, it was again a freshman who led the pack for the Crimson. Abbe Goldstein, in her competitive collegiate debut, finished with a time of 17:36, coming in as the 17th individual finisher out of nearly 200 of the nation’s top long-distance runners. Not far behind were two seniors, captain Elianna Shwayder and Fiona Davis, with times of 17:58 and 18:28, respectively.
“Yesterday was our first real measurement of the season, and we had a couple of real standout performances,” Shwayder said. “Mainly our goal was just to start to get a feel for racing, and apply a good and relaxed approach to that. I think that there are definitely a few more pieces of the puzzle to fall into the fold that will come along as we move out of our foundation state of training.”
With light rain giving way to showers at times throughout the day, the course was extremely muddy. As a result, there were many falls in both the men’s and women’s races.  The hardest rain of the day came right as the men’s race was set to begin, causing a sloppy start. Experienced seniors, Spear and Shwayder both saw the challenging conditions in a positive light, seeing the mud as fun and exciting.
“It’s kind of cool to go out there and get muddy.”  Spear said.
The women’s team travels next to the Midwest for the Wisconsin Nuttycombe Invitational on October 13th. The men’s team will face off with some of the region’s heavyweights at the New England Championships on October 7th.

to be playing a few players down,” sophomore flyhalf Delia Hellander said,
“because they didn’t have enough players to match us, but we just wanted to
focus on our game plan and practice on our patterns and execute it well.”
The Crimson overpowered
the Mountaineers from the opening kick-off. Freshman Milan Roberts swiftly cut
through the defense for a try within the first five minutes, and Harvard never
looked back.
For the rest of the
half, the Crimson maintained a huge advantage in possession time, countering
any offensive attempt by Mt. St. Mary’s with stringent defense and strong
tackling. The Mountaineers struggled to take down the streaking Harvard players
with large portions of the half played near Mt. St. Mary’s goal area. The
Crimson’s moved the ball efficiently allowing various players to sprint down
the field.
“I think we’re a really
physically dominant team,” senior captain Maya Learned said, “and our passes
were really, really crisp and played our game for pretty much the entire game,
and it was really great.”
Harvard’s impassable
defense paved the wave for a high-octane offense, which notched a total of nine
tries in the first half, jolting the Crimson to an impressive 55-0 at
half-time. Junior Caitlin Weigel accumulated three tries in the first half,
including one off a blocked kick, epitomizing the Harvard’s ability to turn
defense into offense.
Although with the clear
advantage going into the second half, the Crimson did not let up and instead
raised the intensity of its play even higher.
“I would say it’s getting better
with every rep,” Learned said, “every kickoff, every time you score, the next
time is going to be better than that, so I think that’s a big part of our team;
we talk about that going from game to game, practice to practice, just getting
better.”
Five different players scored
a combined five tries within the first 15 minutes of the half, increasing the
score to 88-0. Harvard was relentless, never giving up an inch to its opponents
and allowing some of its newer players to shine.
“So, we actually put in
a few of our newer players,” Hellander said, “We had a few walk-ons debut in
the first game, just getting them into the pattern play and we still executed
well. We still had some of our leaders on the field who helped lead them and
guide them, and we just powered through.”
The Crimson surpassed
the 100 point mark mid-way through the second half and continued to pile on
tries, accumulating a total of 20 over the course of the game. When the horn
sounded at the conclusion of the match, the score rested at 130-0, Harvard’s most
lopsided win in its history.
With many players
performing well, Learned placed special praise on sophomore Dominique Cantave.
“She’s awesome on
offense, but she’s willing to put in the big hits on defense,” Learned said.
“In a game like this, when it’s easy to get complacent, so that’s what you look
for, that heart in a player.”
Even
though it’s easy to become comfortable with its success, the team is only
looking ahead and working to improve with every game.
“We’re looking forward
to our Ivy League Games,” Learned said. “The biggest game of our season will
definitely be Dartmouth and so we just build and build to that and Ivy
Championships.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its first event since a second-place finish at last season’s Ivy League Championships, the women’s golf team travelled to Penn State to compete against some Ancient Eight rivals and other East Coast powerhouses in the Nittany Lion Invitational.
The Crimson’s five-person team placed seventh out of a field of 14 teams, shooting 35 over par across three rounds in two days. The Crimson rounded out the top half of the leaderboard, finishing two strokes behind sixth-place Seton Hall and 11 strokes up on eighth-place Yale.
Maryland took home first place, beating out the hosts Penn State by three shots. Maryland played near mistake-free golf; the Terrapins did not tally a single round in the eighties, and Maryland freshman Laura Van Respaille shot a tournament-leading 4 under par, including one of only two rounds in the 60s.
Rounding out the top five were Delaware, Princeton, and Rutgers.
The Crimson got its first look at Ivy League rivals Princeton, Yale, Penn, and Columbia. Princeton, the league’s reigning champs got the better of the Crimson, who finished 10 shots back of the Tigers. The Crimson, however, did place second among the five Ivy League competitors at the invitational.
Also competing over the weekend were teams from Ohio, South Florida, Bucknell, and Youngstown State.
The weekend marked the first time since 2014 that the Crimson travelled to State Park, Penn., to compete in the invitational. The 6,341-yard Blue Course played at a par 72 for the weekend, featuring the customary bevy of four par 5s and four par 3s, that included a heavily-bunkered front nine and two water hazards on the back nine. Only one player, captain Lita Guo, has been on the team long enough to remember the last time the Crimson competed at this Invitational.
“Back in my freshman year, it was still the first tournament of the season,” Guo said. “It’s a good point for us to ramp up and get ready for the season. It felt really similar. It felt like going back to my freshman year.”
The Crimson featured three returners, Guo, Michelle Xie `19, Anna Zhou `19, and two freshmen, Belinda Hu and Jessica Luo. Zhou, a junior from Palo Alto, California, led the pace, finishing one under par over her three rounds, good enough for a tied fourth place finish out of a field of 85. Zhou capitalized on par 5s, posting a scoring average of 4.58 on the 12 par 5s she faced. Zhou’s weekend performance included a 2 under round of 70 on Saturday afternoon, during which she tallied an eagle 2 on hole 6.
“I hit it pretty close. I had 100 yards going in, and then it sounded like a really good shot…I heard it hit the flagstick so I automatically assumed it would have bounced off…but we went up there and it was actually in the hole,” Zhou said. Zhou also recorded 10 birdies over her three rounds. “I was feeling pretty confident coming into this tournament.”
Although this was the first time Zhou played the course as a Harvard athlete, she competed at the Penn State Blue Course in 2013 in a junior tournament and remembers shooting 8 under par.
“I was a little bit familiar with the course,” Zhou said. “My putting was in a good place as well so I just tried to focus on the process, and the support of my teammates helped a lot. Everything just fit together.”
Freshman Belinda Hu finished in a tie for 20th in her first collegiate tournament, and junior Michelle Xie finished 25th.
“I think the freshmen really enjoyed their first tournament,” Guo said. “They learned a lot about how college tournaments work. I think they played great. They did their job.” For her part, Guo relishes her additional involvement on the team this year. “I was able to pass down the wisdom upperclassmen had passed down to me, seeing the team develop throughout the year.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On a quiet Sunday night at Jordan Field, Harvard men’s soccer struggled to find its bearings against Albany, dropping its second straight game, 3-1. The Great Danes (6-2-0) topped the Crimson (1-4-1) in the first ever meeting between the two schools.
Harvard spent much of the first half on the defensive, attempting only three shots to Albany’s seven. The Great Danes kept the pressure on early, playing fast and pushing the ball into Crimson territory, going into halftime with a two-goal advantage. Harvard was on the offensive more in the second half, netting a consolation goal, but ultimately fell short.
Unable to play in its offensive third, the Crimson struggled to put pressure on Albany’s defense, leaving the door open for the Great Danes to strike.
After a slow opening 20 minutes, Albany snuck through the defense for the first score of the game. The goal gave the Great Danes momentum as they played on Harvard’s side of the field for much of the first half.
The game remained back and forth until a costly foul in the final minute of the half gave Albany a free kick from the right corner. The Great Danes capitalized on the set piece, with a backdoor header giving them a 2-0 lead headed into halftime. The Crimson have made defending the opposition’s set pieces a priority, but on this occasion they faltered.
“I think, moving forward, is just making sure we’re marked up defensively when they have free kicks or corner kicks,” senior defender Justin Crichlow said.
Albany carried its energy into the second half, putting the pressure on early. Harvard senior goalie Kyle Parks saved a laser from the Great Danes in the opening minutes of the half, turning the tide towards the Crimson. Following another Parks save, Harvard started playing more of the game in its offensive third.
After some back and forth play, Albany netted another header in the 63rd minute to give them a 3-0 lead late in the game.
“I felt like every time we started getting some momentum, they would put one in the back of our net,” Crichlow said.
However, freshman midfielder Cornelius Bencsik provided Harvard with a lone bright spot, scoring his first collegiate goal in the 68th minute. On its first shot on goal in the second half, Harvard was able to push a goal past Albany’s tough defense. Senior midfielder Christian Sady set up the goal with a precise ball from the top of the box.
“I was just focused on getting in behind, actually creating something…. I made a sharp movement inside and behind the defense, and [Sady] put an excellent ball,” Bencsik said.
Following the Crimson’s goal, the Great Danes threatened with numbers, but freshman midfielder Sebastian Linder-Liaw single-handedly cut off the odd-man rush. Harvard responded with its own offensive push following its lone score.
On a jump ball, Bencsik crashed into the Albany goalie in a nasty collision, his second of the game. He left the game earlier with an injury following a separate mid-air collision, but returned shortly thereafter with a bandaged forehead.
Despite a few more shots and corner kicks late in the second half, the Crimson was unable to convert on any of its remaining offensive opportunities. The back-and-forth affair between the two teams continued for the rest of the game, but the score remained unchanged.
Harvard continues to stress the importance of playing a full 90 minutes of cohesive soccer.
“We still struggle to fulfill a whole game. The last 30 minutes we created some chances, but we have to be on that level throughout the game,” Bencsik said.
Harvard continues to fine tune its cohesiveness early on in the season, seeing bright spots such as putting pressure on the Great Danes’ defense by getting behind the Albany backs later in the game. Harvard has stressed the importance of getting on the attack and catching the defense off guard.
“We made the adjustment to try to put them on their heels a little bit more,” Crichlow said.
In the end, it was not enough to best the Great Danes.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In its second competition of the fall season, the Harvard men’s golf team finished third at the Quechee Club Collegiate Challenege, with strong performances from multiple players. The current Ivy League champions finished with 586 points, behind rivals Princeton (571 points), and winners Drexel (570) – hosts Dartmouth finished 8th out of 14.
Senior Greg Royston, a native of Cape Town, South Africa, finished 3rd overall, shooting a 70 and a 73, with an overall score of 1 under par – two shots off the lead. After a clinical first round of three under he finished two over par in the second, but he was still able to keep that level of consistency necessary to break into the top three for the competition. Other notable performances included Belgium native and junior Aurian Capart who finished 15th overall with a score of three above par. Sophomore Ryan Rhee also produced a score of +3 tying Capart in 15th.
After two weeks of intra-squad qualifiers and practice, the Crimson was ready for real competition when it left campus Friday morning. After a practice round where the team was able to get to grips with fast greens and narrow fairways, the team knew mechanically what it had to do.
“Because the greens were quite sloped, we knew that even the smallest of mistakes on the green could lead to real problems, so we focused on minimizing the dangers of the slick greens,” Capart said.
Tee-shots were especially important as well, given the narrow nature of the course, with mistakes here causing a more difficult than usual path going forward, thus making the first and last shots the most difficult on the course.
Harvard started the first day of competition well, coming out on top at the end of the day. Sunday was full of more solid performances, though the team slipped from first to third overall.
Perhaps the most encouraging takeaway from the weekend was seen in freshman Chase Furey’s play. The California native played as an individual after not making the top five in qualifiers for Harvard last week. When it came to real competition, however, he excelled, drawing level with Capart, tying him in 15th. He had an especially exceptional second round, shooting two under.
This match bodes well for the Crimson who lost many of its strongest players to graduation last season – Robert Deng and captain Daniel De La Garza among others – but what has been true for the 2016 and 2017 Ivy League Champions is that players have always been able to step up and fill the gap left behind. Royston and Capart, a senior and junior respectively know they have important roles to play this year in terms of leadership and performance. And away from them, freshman Chase Furey’s performance points towards the necessity of talent maintenance.
The Crimson train is gaining momentum with the renewal of ability and the familiarization with intra-team roles, and they best stay hot if they are to survive the Boston winter.
