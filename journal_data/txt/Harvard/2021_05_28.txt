After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Supreme Court justices will discuss whether to take up a case against Harvard’s race-conscious admissions policies during their weekly conference on June 10, with a decision on whether to accept the petition from anti-affirmative action group Students for Fair Admissions likely coming as soon as June 14.
SFFA petitioned the Supreme Court to grant a writ of certiorari and hear the case on Feb. 25, and Harvard filed a brief in opposition on May 17.
The lawsuit was initially filed against the University in 2014, alleging that the school’s race-conscious admissions policies discriminate against Asian American applicants. SFFA argues the policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits institutions that receive federal funds from discriminating “on the grounds of race, color, or national origin.”
The Massachusetts District Court ruled in Harvard’s favor in October 2019, ruling Harvard’s use of race-conscious admissions is legal, and the First Circuit Court affirmed the previous ruling in November 2020.
The Court updated the case’s docket Tuesday to reflect that the case had been added to the discuss list for the June 10 conference. At least one justice must elect to confer about a particular case in conference before the case is added to the discuss list.
Cases distributed for conference may be taken up if four of the nine Justices vote in favor of granting cert. Typically on the Monday morning following each conference, the Court publishes an order list announcing cases which have been granted cert, and successful petitions are added to the Court’s docket.
The Court typically grants certiorari and hears oral argument in about 80 cases out of the 7,000 to 8,000 petitions filed each term — about one percent — typically hearing cases argued in a U.S. Court of Appeals or the highest Court in a given state. Terms extend from the first Monday of October to the following year, and the Court is typically in recess from late June to the early July until the first Monday of October, when it begins to hear oral arguments for cases on the docket.
Harvard’s brief in opposition to SFFA’s petition argues that SFFA has produced “no persuasive evidence” against Harvard and establishes “no unsettled issue” that merits review.
“There is no circuit split to resolve, and this Court rarely grants certiorari to review the application of settled law to a particular set of facts,” the brief reads. “Where, as here, two lower courts have made ‘concurrent findings,’ this Court will not overturn them absent ‘a very obvious and exceptional showing of error,’ … a showing SFFA cannot remotely make. ”
SFFA did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
Legal experts said in previous interviews that the Supreme Court may hear the case and declare the University’s admissions policies illegal due to its current conservative composition.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard awarded 2,440 degrees across the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at its second consecutive virtual Commencement ceremony Thursday, including 1,292 degrees to the College’s Class of 2021.
A sunny Tercentenary Theatre, where Commencement is normally held, sat empty Thursday. The University elected to postpone its in-person graduation in favor of an online ceremony due to Covid-19, even as other area schools have held socially distanced ceremonies in recent weeks.
University President Lawrence S. Bacow opened the ceremony with recorded remarks from his office in Massachusetts Hall, noting that “this is where I used to come to work.”
“I haven’t done that for 440 days and counting — but who’s counting?” Bacow joked.
“A global pandemic has kept us apart this year, but we have learned together; we have grown together; we have overcome together,” Bacow added. “I have never seen such grit, such determination. And I have never, ever been prouder of this institution.”
In the ceremony’s principal address, Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Prairie View A&M University, drew on the story of her segregated upbringing in Houston and called on Harvard and its graduates “to be a force for inclusion.”
“I call on all of you to declare that you will not give sanction to discriminatory actions that hold some groups back to the advantage of others,” Simmons told graduates. “I call on you to be a force for inclusion by not choosing enclaves of wealth, privilege, and tribalism such that you abandon the lessons you learned from your Harvard experience of diversity. ”
Simmons received a Ph.D. from Harvard in Romance Languages and Literatures in 1973 and went on to serve as the president of both Brown University and Smith College, in addition to Prairie View. At Brown, she became the first Black president of an Ivy League institution.
Towards the end of her speech, Simmons asked graduates what they “are prepared to do to acknowledge and address the historic biases and inequities that so many continue to experience.”
“Will your actions point us in a more uplifting direction?” She said. “For, just as we recount the moral bankruptcy of those who cruelly enslaved others, we also tell the story of those who were equally guilty because they refused to challenge the practice of slavery.”
“Just as I ask Harvard to use its voice on behalf of minority institutions that have been unfairly treated across time, I ask you to add your voice to the cause of justice wherever you go,” she concluded.
She reflected on feeling like an outsider during her time at Harvard, envious of peers who could see themselves in the University’s history and traditions.
“Few things that I could see at Harvard at the time represented me,” she said. “Perhaps it is the memory of that feeling that moved me to remain in university life to make that experience easier for others who felt excluded.”
“The need to make universities more aware of how first generation and underserved communities reacted to the stultified tradition in many universities shaped my conviction about the importance of individuals feeling fully embraced and respected as learners, erasing vestiges of disparagement that inevitably accrue in an unequal society,” Simmons added.
In her address, she called on universities like Harvard “to acknowledge the limitations imposed” on historically Black colleges and universities like Prairie View “by the legacy of underfunding and isolation from the mainstream of higher education.”
“While universities like Harvard had the wind at their back, flourishing from endowments, strong enrollments, constant curricular expansion, massive infrastructure improvements, and significant endowment growth, HBCUs often had gale force winds impeding their development,” she said.
Silvana Gómez ’21 and Graduate School of Education student Vincent H. Bish Jr. delivered the Class of 2021’s undergraduate and graduate English addresses, respectively.
Gómez shared an anecdote from her first day of kindergarten, when she clung to her mother’s leg for fear of having to “confront this new world” all by herself.
She said the Class of 2021 now bears the responsibility of creating a new normal after the Covid-19 pandemic and of enacting change to combat racism, xenophobia, and classism.
Gómez charged graduates to work to dismantle oppression, pointing to police brutality, unequal access to healthcare, and violence against Asian-Americans as notable challenges of their generation.
“The generations to come are looking up to us as we put out fires and lay the foundation of a world that they will be proud to be a part of,” she said.
In the face of this “large and crucial task,” Gómez acknowledged graduates may want to cling to the familiarity and comfort of Harvard, just as she held onto her mother years ago.
She urged her peers to recall her mother’s advice that “no matter how scared you are in the moment, you overcome your fears and you keep pushing.”
In a speech entitled “Four Lone Names,” Bish reflected on how the Class of 2021 can fulfill the legacies of their ancestors, and how he can honor the four enslaved individuals who lived at Harvard.
“I imagine they say to us that we, the living, stand under a unique duty to the deceased,” he said.
Citing Harvard’s history as the place where the idea of “intersectionality” arose and the home of the country’s first school of public health, Bish called on graduates to use their intellect to “forgo the spirit of disempowerment” and work to achieve greater fairness.
“The work we have to do — in this decade — is too precious for your timidity,” he said. “The mountains we have to climb are too steep for soft shoes.”
Vish called on the Class of 2021 to live lives worthy of the service of the four enslaved at Harvard — named Bilhah, Venus, Titus, and Juba — and to be not only “the bearers of great privilege, but the breakers of powerful yokes as well.”
The University also awarded seven honorary degrees during Thursday’s ceremony, to actress and professor Anna Deavere Smith, photojournalist Sebastião R. Salgado, former Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Margaret H. Marshall, educator Salman “Sal” Khan, sociology professor Arlie R. Hochschild, outgoing Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron, and Nobel Laureate Frances H. Arnold.
Singer and bass player Devon N. Gates ’23, a dual degree candidate at the College and the Berklee College of Music, performed the song “Stand By Me” from a recording in Sanders Theatre. The ceremony closed with a virtual rendition of the song “Fair Harvard” by the Harvard Choruses and the Harvard Band.
Harvard has pledged to eventually hold in-person Commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021, both of which celebrated graduation online due to the pandemic.
“One day, you will celebrate your graduation on campus with classmates and friends in familiar places — and that day cannot come soon enough,” Bacow said during his welcoming remarks. “For now, delight in the company of those who have cheered you on and cheered you up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard alumni elected five new members to the Board of Overseers — the University’s second-highest governing body — including one candidate backed by the climate action and racial justice campaign Harvard Forward.
The newly-elected members include Mark J. Carney ’87, the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance; Christopher B. Howard, the president of Robert Morris University; Raymond J. Lohier Jr. ’88, a U.S. Circuit Judge; Megan H. Red Shirt-Shaw, an Indigenous activist; and Sheryl WuDunn, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist.
“It will be a privilege to welcome our new colleagues to the Board, and I know their diverse perspectives and experience will serve us well,” incoming Board president Helena Buonanno Foulkes ’86 said in a press release.
Harvard Forward had put forth three candidates for election, all of whom qualified for the ballot via a petition process, but Red Shirt-Shaw was the only one elected. All other elected candidates were put up by the Harvard Alumni Association’s alumni nominating committee.
Due to fall 2020 reforms to the Board, only six petition-nominated members may serve at a time. Three candidates backed by Harvard Forward won seats on the Board in 2020, meaning Red Shirt-Shaw brings the current tally up to four.
Three of the five incoming Board of Overseers members — Carney, Lohier, and WuDunn — were endorsed by the Coalition for a Diverse Harvard, an alumni group seeking to improve diversity at the University that advocates for the creation of an ethnic studies program and improved hiring and retention of diverse faculty.
The school announced the election results just hours after the conclusion of its virtual Commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2021.
“This past year has confronted Harvard with an unprecedented set of challenges, and I look forward to a new academic year when the governing boards can help the University emerge from the pandemic with the benefit of lessons learned and with a commitment to helping make Harvard stronger than ever,” Buonanno Foulkes said in the release.
The University also announced six new elected directors of the Harvard Alumni Association, including Whitney S. F. Baxter ’07, an executive at MTV; Jane Labanowski ’17, lead of Spaceport development at SpaceX; Hannah Park ’13, a human resources partner at Curriculum Associates; Rebecca C. Ribaudo ’93, an author; George A. Thampy ’10, an executive at CareDx; and Maiya W. Verrone ’84, a television writer and producer.
“The volunteers joining us will strengthen our efforts to connect, support and empower the global community of Harvard graduates who are serving their communities and who continue the centuries-long tradition of using their talents to help others,” incoming HAA president Vanessa W. Liu ’96 said in a press release.
The directors election saw a higher turnout than the Board of Overseers election, with 39,542 and 38,211 alumni casting ballots, respectively. Those elected to the Board will serve six-year terms, while the HAA directors will be elected for three years.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard’s Office of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging hosted Latinx and Black graduations for students across the University’s schools on Tuesday afternoon.
The two pre-commencement ceremonies featured performances, award presentations, speeches from students and invited guests, and slideshows to honor individual graduates.
Notably, the Black graduation also included a moment of silence to commemorate the one-year anniversary of George Floyd’s murder, as well to make space for individuals in the audience who lost loved ones to police violence.
MSNBC anchor Joy M. Reid ’90, the event’s keynote speaker, encouraged graduates in the audience to reflect on the “true value” of their degrees.
“Today is about you and whether you wind up doing whatever you want with your Harvard degree,” Reid said. “The value of what you have achieved is not ultimately in how much money it makes for you … but rather, in how you use what you’ve achieved to impact the world.”
James S. Ramsey ’15, who is graduating Harvard’s Law and Divinity schools this year, went on to present Professor Cornel West ’74 with the Tracie D. Jones Award for Diversity, Education and Inclusion for advancing excellence in those areas at Harvard. West — a Professor of the Practice of Public Philosophy at HDS and in the Department of African and African American Studies in the Faculty of Arts of Sciences — announced in March that he will depart to Union Theological Seminary after Harvard dismissed his request to be considered for tenure.
“Dr. West has a real gift for amplifying the accomplishments and talents of others,” Ramsey said. “In an industry like academia, and in our society more generally, that can be inward-facing, overly competitive and self-interested, and in dire need of integrity, Dr. West demonstrates what it means to embody a better way.”
The Latinx graduation featured poetry from Claribel A. Whyte, who is graduating from the Graduate School of Education. Whyte read her poem “Dreams That Survive,” in which she encouraged her fellow graduates to “dream and fly without fear.”
“Here we are, from all walks of life, graduating from the best educational institution in the world,” Whyte said in her preceding remarks. “We are truly a manifestation of the dreams that our elders had for us.”
In his address at the Latinx Graduation, Marcelo Garzo Montalvo — a visiting professor of Latinx studies and the faculty director of the Latinx Studies Working Group — urged graduates to share the lessons they acquired from their time at Harvard.
“We are the future ancestors of our own descendants, whether or not we choose to have biological children,” Garzo Montalvo said. “You are the conduit, the vehicle, the interlocutor, of precious knowledge that must be passed on to our youth, to each other, and integrated into our hearts and our lives.”
Following the Latinx graduation, Nicole S. Moulia ’21 wrote in an email to The Crimson that the festivities did an “amazing job” at bringing students together.
“Simply being in the presence of my Latinx classmates and professors, even while sitting in front of my computer at home, was a comforting way to end my Harvard journey,” she wrote.
