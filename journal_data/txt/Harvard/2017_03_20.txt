After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Earlier this March, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana issued a school-wide email that included the Implementation Committee’s final recommendations on unrecognized single-gender social organizations. The 46-page report contains a host of ideas, spanning from the details of USGSO penalties to the replacement of final clubs in campus social culture. With the exception of a few deficiencies, many of the report’s ideas to fortify social culture show great promise to shift student life away from the social hegemony of final clubs.
Students and faculty have already begun to lambast the report—particularly its recommendation to create inter-House “dining societies” that seem to echo the elitism of final clubs themselves. The report’s suggestion that these “dining societies” could gather to read Chaucer aloud together in dining halls may have especially missed the mark.
The College, of course, must not recreate the culture of final clubs. Instead, it should ensure that the societies and spaces it describes are distributed equitably across the student body. The report’s language of putting on “a gala mixer at the Harvard Club of Boston” and renting “a cruise boat on the Boston Harbor” seem to raise more questions about whether these proposed social options are accessible to all. As stated in the recommendations, every proposal for inclusive social spaces should be designed to minimize financial or cultural barriers to participation. These initiatives should provide and clearly advertise financial aid for students with need.
However, we cannot let the minutiae of the Implementation Committee’s report distract us from its more important initiatives. In particular, the report’s ideas on improving the physical social spaces on campus have succeeded in responding to student wishes. Renovating and opening the roof of the SOCH as a party space for students, for example, demonstrates a commitment to creating the infrastructure for social spaces that students have previously demanded. Other plans, such as repurposing the Cambridge Queen’s Head and investing in Loeb House as a potential event hall, further underline the committee’s acknowledgement of the dearth of physical social spaces on campus.
If implemented with sufficient cultural and financial awareness, the dining societies can similarly strengthen House life on campus. Weekly meals that foster community spirit have already been proven to be successful for organizations like the Franklin Fellowship. However, the College will have to be careful that these potential organizations' goal to be “open to all who wish to participate” is not undermined by the societies themselves.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In a small suburb called Baytown, Texas, to the southeast of Houston, lies Lee College―where the leaves don’t change color in the fall, not a single student lives on campus, and the most popular major is process technology. Here, a short walk from the technical learning labs for refinery and manufacturing, in a classroom whose walls are adorned with handwritten farewells from alumni interspersed among the striking artworks of Klimt, Matisse, and Seurat, I started my trajectory toward Harvard.
We first heard of the course hosted in this classroom, The Human Condition, toward the end of our sophomore year at IMPACT Early College High School. My classmates and I were allowed to design a combined high school and college curriculum to quickly earn the first half of a marketable college degree by the end of our senior year and hopefully find a job that required more than a high school diploma thereafter. For some of us, college wouldn’t be an option if we enrolled in a traditional high school.
With our junior year coursework in mind, the instructors of The Human Condition pitched the class as a practical means for meeting Core Curriculum requirements for public colleges in Texas. By combining a year-long introduction to the humanities with English composition, The Human Condition would knock out two whole categories in the Core Curriculum. The instructors also said that the intense reading, writing, and discussing would make students much stronger communicators in the work force. Eager to knock out a few class requirements and beef up my resume at the same time, I signed up.
“Dare to Question” was written in bold text on the first page of a lengthy syllabus, hinting the real reason we were there. Over the next year, we studied together to understand the different frameworks on which many social norms were built and learned to appreciate the weight of the narratives driven by these norms. My concern about degree requirements and the exact trajectory toward that final, tangible result of my education melted away, giving rise to feelings of excitement, fulfillment, and curiosity. In a whirlwind of personal discovery and intellectual growth, we caught sight of the true underpinnings of liberal arts education.
For some of the students in the class, the existence of a humanistic concept of social norms was surprising in that it was so relatable yet hitherto not explicitly named or characterized. Many of the students from this category were brought up in challenging circumstances and always felt the tenacious, nagging feeling that some invisible force constrained their identities and capacity to express themselves, but found other concerns far too pressing to explore their feelings further. For others, being brought up in a close-minded, unquestioning environment meant that such matters were rarely challenged. Social norms in their households were seen as strict and static.
For us all, coming from diverse life paths that lead to taking The Human Condition at Lee College, it was incredibly difficult to talk about ideas and feelings. Nonetheless, we knew at the end of the course, some for the first time, that there is a certain value to education that can’t be captured by marketable college degrees, accelerated curricula, or Core Curriculum checkboxes.
At Harvard, we are thoroughly reminded of the aims and value of a liberal arts education during Opening Days before ever stepping foot in the classroom. For my Human Condition classmates, though, it wasn’t always a given. Necessity and a lack of exposure to certain educational ideals led many to take a practical approach to their studies. Children of families who struggle financially and who struggle with immigration and discrimination are sometimes taught first that education is a means of surviving and second that education is a means of liberating one’s mind. Sometimes the first function of education is so urgent that the second is never considered. In pitching their course the way they did but teaching it under fundamental liberal arts aims, the instructors recognized something that people from educational environments that differ from Baytown’s might miss.
What happens in the bubble of a traditional liberal arts school like Harvard, 1600 miles away, is marvelous. People feel galvanized to expend considerable effort pursuing questions for which they know exist no concrete answers and to engage with one another at all hours to challenge everything they know and experience. Every player in this environment is better off for it.
But never assume that the environments outside of these bubbles are not conducive to intellectual inquiry. Never underestimate the value of an education in any setting. And never dismiss the capacity for intellectual inquiry in people from other backgrounds.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I just threw away a pair of black leather boots that carried considerable sentimental value. When I bought them, I vowed never to throw them away. I wanted to keep them looking nice and neat forever. And yet, when I dumped them in the trash two weeks ago, I felt completely elated.
One of my fondest childhood memories is the time I picked out these boots with my mother. Though I was already 13 years old when I bought them, I remember feeling as if owning these shoes solidified my status as A Real Teenager, because they were the first shoes I bought in an adult size. I received them for Christmas when I was in eighth grade, and I loved them for the next eight years.
But in the recent past, I felt self-conscious every time I wore them. My boots looked battered. I had worn down the heels. They were stained. The leather had formed so closely to my feet that, if I took off my shoes, you could make out the faint outline of my toes at the front.
Why was I holding on to them?
Truth be told, I cared more about their monetary worth than their sentimental value. I wanted to make them last. They weren’t particularly expensive, and I wore them all the time. I had likely gotten my money’s worth by the time I graduated high school. But year after year, I lugged them to Cambridge and allowed them to take up room in my small closet because I couldn’t rationalize throwing them in the trash.
I’m reminded of a story I’ll never forget, recounted by author Mildred Armstrong Kalish in her memoir “Little Heathens.” Kalish grew up on a farm in Iowa during the Great Depression and was taught to make everything she owned serve her for as long as possible. Her grandmother saved socks with holes in the toe by cutting off the front so they were a bit shorter, sewing them back up, and handing them to someone with smaller feet. She’d do this endlessly, until the socks fit infants. If new holes appeared at that point, she’d cut off the front a final time and sew the woolen tube into the end of someone’s coat sleeve as a wrist warmer.
I strive to respect the things I own as much as Kalish’s grandmother did each individual sock that passed through her house. But ironically, reading this story gave me the confidence I needed to throw my shoes away rather than keep them.
I was inspired to do this by the end of the story, when Kalish’s grandmother accepts that the infant-sized sock with a hole in the toe has fulfilled its job as a sock. She can repurpose it as something entirely different—in this case, a wrist warmer—but even she, during the Great Depression, knew to retire something when it wasn’t performing its duty anymore.
I’d like to think I did the same thing with my boots. From an economic standpoint, it didn’t make sense to re-sole them, a service they desperately needed. I’d already replaced the soles twice before—once more, I’d invest more money in fixing them than I paid in the first place.
Alternatively, I could have repurposed the boots to serve me in some other way. My mother, famous for her quirky interior decorating, keeps some of my tiny shoes from infancy on her bookshelves. If you ask her why, she’ll tell you that she sees them as art, what with the wear they show and the stories they tell. However, I didn’t think the Harvard Student Art Show would accept a “sculpture” made of my boots nailed to a stand.
More importantly, I thought it might be nice to have one fewer pair of shoes in my closet, one fewer belonging to worry about, and one fewer thing to clutter my life.
There’s a misconception that you must have an “overflowing wardrobe” to be fashionable. Style bloggers perpetuate this to no end. Journalists shame celebrities for repeating outfits, claiming to “catch” stars wearing the same shoes twice as if this were naughty. Meanwhile, over 3.4 million YouTube viewers have gawked at Kylie Jenner giving a tour of her extensive closet. Whether these viewers were impressed or disgusted is irrelevant—the sheer number of viewers proves that people find excess interesting.
But even I, a lover of clothes, think that less is more when it comes to stocking your closet. As “fast fashion” providers like Zara, H&M, and Topshop churn out affordable clothes at an alarming pace, it is becoming easier to buy reams of clothes without breaking the bank, but I’d rather have two sweaters of good quality than 20 poorly-made sweaters for the same total cost.
And even if I could choose between two closets full of quality clothes, I’d rather have two sweaters than twenty. This may not be a popular opinion amongst Americans, but there are some people—most notably, the author of “The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,” Marie Kondo, and her fans—who agree with me. Inspired by the minimalist teachings of Zen Buddhism, there are many who know that overconsumption can be overwhelming.
They know that space in your closet gives you space to breathe.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered

Eleven Harvard professors and one fellow have signed a statement affirming a commitment to engaging with—and opposing efforts to “silence”—those with opposing views.
The statement, entitled “Truth Seeking, Democracy, and Freedom of Thought and Expression” is co-authored by African and African-American Studies Professor Cornel West and Robert P. George, a Princeton professor. It was published on the program’s website on March 14, and over 600 professors, students, and college affiliates have signed the statement as of Sunday.
“The pursuit of knowledge and the maintenance of a free and democratic society require the cultivation and practice of the virtues of intellectual humility, openness of mind, and, above all, love of truth,” the statement reads.“That’s why all of us should seek respectfully to engage with people who challenge our views. And we should oppose efforts to silence those with whom we disagree—especially on college and university campuses,” it continues.
Although the statement does not mention any one institution or incident, its publication follows a recent  highly-publicized confrontation between Middlebury College students and controversial social scientist Charles Murray. Student protesters repeatedly disupted Murray, who had been invited by a conservative student group, pulling fire alarms during his talk, throwing objects at his car when he left, and ultimately injuring a Middlebury professor accompanying Murray.
“It is all-too-common these days for people to try to immunize from criticism opinions that happen to be dominant in their particular communities,” the statement reads. “Sometimes this is done by questioning the motives and thus stigmatizing those who dissent from prevailing opinions; or by disrupting their presentations; or by demanding that they be excluded from campus or, if they have already been invited, disinvited.”
After leaving Harvard for nearly 14 years following a high-profile fight with then president Lawrence H. Summers, West returned at the beginning of the semester to become a “professor of the practice of public philosophy.”
Harvard-affiliated signatories of the statement include Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and former Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier.
Flier said that he found the statement “entirely unobjectionable” and “positive.”
“This is an issue of broad national significance,” Flier said. “It really is pretty focused on the core issue of what should be the approach of the universities in particular to freedom of speech even on issues that would be seen as controversial or a source of major disagreement.”
Flier described the events at Middlebury as “very visible and very stark” and urged more Harvard affiliates to sign the statement.
“People of goodwill and good intent are beginning to recognize that they’d better say something in defense of free speech and in opposition to violence and disruption on campuses,” said Flier.  “From my own point of view, institutions like Harvard which are influential should be in the lead in trying to take strong stance such as the one taken in this statement.”
Kennedy School Professor Jane J. Mansbridge, a signatory of the statement, said she believes that actions such as chanting in order to keep others from being heard should be reserved for situations of “emergency” when other options for communication are exhausted.
“I think there are moments when frustrations and anger over lack of change will lead people to take action like this,” she said.

After 11 years at its Brattle St. corner, American Apparel will close its doors March 26—neon spandex and all—following nationwide bankruptcy suits.
The company filed for bankruptcy twice, in 2015 and 2016, and was sold to Canadian clothing chain Gildan Activewear for $88 million in January. American Apparel plans to close all 110 of its stores by the end of April.
American Apparel declined to comment about the Harvard Square closure.
Although the store was not a member of the Harvard Square Business Association, Executive Director Denise A. Jillson recalled working with American Apparel early on due to a controversy over its advertising, which many have characterized as sexually explicit.
Jillson said the store sparked debate throughout Cambridge after they displayed posters of “provocative” advertisements shortly after opening in 2006.
“The community was outraged,” Jillson said. “Some of the model girls looked like they had been abused and they were black and blue marks on their body and they were sexually provocative.”
After a call from the City Manager, Jillson talked to American Apparel employees on behalf of the Harvard Square Business Association and asked they remove the ad posters, which they did.
“Such an odd company. I guess it doesn’t surprise me that they weren’t long-term,” Jillson said.
Students, on the other hand, were more disappointed to see the store go.
“I love American Apparel,” Nina Luo ’17 said. “I know that there is a lot of controversy with the company’s history and also founder, Dov Charney. I think, sort of setting that aside and looking at its design, American Apparel is emblematic of a certain generation of style.”
Kira S. Brenner ’18 said that American Apparel was a great place to shop for costume pieces.
“In general, I just like their store, it’s nice,” Brenner said. “They’re a good shop for very specific things, if you need something really shiny or just kind of crazy and out there, they’ve just got good stuff.”
Both Brenner and Luo said that they were interested to see what will succeed American Apparel at the soon-to-be vacant store.
“You know, it made being youthful, being ironic, being sort of playful, a very sexy and appealing look—I think it pioneered the Americana look,” Luo said. “So I’m really curious to see what will rise up and replace American Apparel.”

Twenty-six Harvard students were awarded Fulbright scholarships this year, putting Harvard behind some peer institutions in producing Fulbright Scholars for the first time in three years.
Last year, 31 students received Fulbright scholarships. This application cycle puts Harvard slightly behind other peer institutions with Fulbright Scholars—thirty Brown students received scholarships, as well as 27 from Georgetown and the University of Notre Dame. Like Harvard, 26 students at the University of Chicago received Fulbright scholarships.
One hundred and thirty-seven students across the University applied for scholarships, marking the highest number of applicants per university  in the country.
The Fulbright scholarship provides funding from the federal government for undergraduate and graduate students to teach and travel internationally in more than 140 countries.
Gregory A. Llacer, director of the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships who advises Fulbright applicants, wrote in an email that he sees Harvard’s place amongst peer institutions as insignificant.
“Ordinal placement at the top of the field is not a worthwhile variable to report, and the difference between number one and number four is negligible,” Llacer wrote.
Llacer added that the numbers reported do not include the number of Harvard students who were offered a Fulbright and declined, which he speculated “does not happen nearly as frequently at other institutions.”
He also wrote that the statistic of the number of Harvard applicants is for Harvard as an entire institution, including the number of students who applied both from the College and from Harvard’s other graduate schools.
“There are more variables and factors that are not represented in the total number,” Llacer wrote.
Llacer wrote that Harvard’s placement this year continues Harvard’s typical trend of receiving many Fulbright scholarships, which has been especially true in recent years.
“I suspect, given the excellent research our candidates are conducting, and the teaching experiences some of our applicant are pursuing, that trend likely will continue,” Llacer said.

When Louisa H. McIntyre ’16 was a junior at the College, she knew she wanted to go to Harvard Law School. But first, she decided, she would try something a little different: stunt work.
In addition to working as a paralegal at a New York City legal assistance group, McIntyre is also pursuing stunt work during her two years before attending the Law School.
“I went to a workshop that was for learning how to do stunts for movies and how to do stage fighting,” McIntyre said. “I’ve done martial arts for a really long time. That’s sort of an interest I’m pursuing. I’m still in the very preliminary stages.”
In the fall of 2018, McIntyre plans to return to Cambridge with the second class of students admitted through the Harvard Law School’s Junior Deferral Program.
Started in 2014, the program allows College juniors to apply and gain acceptance early on the condition that they work or study for at least two years before matriculating. The program is one of many efforts at the Law School to both attract a broader range of applicants and ensure that students have work experience before enrolling.
Just last week, the school announced that it would begin accepting the Graduate Record Examination instead of the more traditional Law School Admission Test, and in recent years the Law School has increasingly emphasized that its applicants have work experience before enrolling. Immediately after the financial crisis in 2008, the number of applicants to the Law School dropped dramatically, but have been increasing in more recent years.
Jessica L. Soban ’02, associate dean of admissions at the Law School, declined to provide admissions statistics for the program because, she said, it is still in a pilot stage. The first class of students accepted through this program will begin their studies at the Law School this fall.
Soban said, however, that the school does not have a fixed number of spots available in any given JDP application cycle.
“We have no preset notion going into any JDP cycle about how many students we will be admitting, so our goal is to get and admit and to find all of the talent that is available with no set number of applicants in mind,” Soban said. “Given that the number of applicants has fluctuated and the number of admits has fluctuated, the admit rate has also fluctuated in each of the three years.”
Once a student has been accepted to the program, just how they spend their two years is largely up to them, as long as there is some “structure.”
Elise M. Baranouski ’15, a member of the first class of juniors to be accepted to the to the program in 2014, has worked at an international human rights law firm since she graduated. She said the professional experience has helped her understand the importance of a formal legal education.
“Because international law is a bit less traditionally legal, or formally legal, I was able to do a lot of the things that the lawyers at the firm were doing, but also see ways in which getting a legal education would really help me and advance me in the field,” Baranouski said.
Soban said that so far, every student who has been admitted to the program has accepted the offer of admission, and that every student admitted to matriculate next fall is still in the program. While the program requires students to defer for at least two years, it allows students to defer longer if they wish, Soban said. The school’s current policy for regular admits is to allow up to three years deferral, but Soban said if a JDP admit had a valid reason for adding an additional year of deferral, that could also be possible.
“We’re highly encouraging of this extending further if you’re doing something that you’re passionate about,” Soban said. “We still want you to come back, but we want people to go out and have those experiences.”
Participants in the program said it also provides them with a rough outline for their postgraduate life.
“I like clarity and organization; you can call me Type A. I liked the idea of knowing what I was going to do, but not having to do it right away,” Jacob R. Carrel ’16, who has spent his deferral working for organizations looking to engage young people in public service, said.
Carrel said the program allowed him to focus on an interest without having to consider how it would appear to law schools.
“[The program] allowed me to go do the exciting work of getting more young people into public service, which is what I really want to do, but I wouldn’t have otherwise known was the right thing to do if I was still worried about what it looked like on a law school application,” he said.
Aaron M. Mukerjee ’16, who will attend the Law School in the fall of 2018 and is currently working for a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, warned against applying to the program solely for the sake having a post-graduate plan in place.
“You have to be sure you want to go to Harvard Law School, because there are other programs for a lot of students, whether it’s a scholarship at another school, there are other top schools that people considered for other reasons,” Mukerjee said.
Soban said that students accepted to the program have maintained their academic success through their senior year, even if though will not be factored into the initial application process. Still, accepted students must submit their final transcript to the Law School.
“If there were a significant academic discrepancy in that fourth-year GPA versus what we had seen, we would sit down and have a conversation. We have not had to have any of those conversations,” Soban said.
Christopher B. Cruz ’17, who will work in consulting during his deferral years, said he and the people he knows in the program have continued to work hard during their final year.
“Supposedly there is an argument that students who are accepted early to a graduate school will tend to slack off their final year, and I’m very much against that hypothesis,” Cruz said.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.—The morning after claiming the ECAC playoff title with a 4-1 victory over No. 9/10 Cornell, the No. 2/2 Harvard hockey team has drawn the first seed in the East Regional of this year’s NCAA Tournament. On Friday, the Crimson (26-5-2, 16-4-2 ECAC) will travel to the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence, R.I. to face off against No. 12/12 Providence College, as released by the NCAA on Sunday. The puck will drop at 4:00 p.m. EST and the game will be broadcast on ESPNU.
After the Crimson’s bout with Providence (22-11-5, 12-7-3 Hockey East), No. 8/8 Western Michigan will battle No. 17 Air Force at 7:30 p.m. for the other spot in the following evening’s East Regional final (8:30 p.m. on ESPNU). The last club standing in Providence on Saturday night will punch its ticket to the Frozen Four in Chicago.
Outside the East Regional, the field’s top seed, Denver, will represent the Midwest when it kicks off its tournament run against Michigan Tech, while No. 3/3 Minnesota Duluth and No. 4/5 Minnesota round out the top seeds, competing in the West and Northeast brackets, respectively.
Harvard enters the NCAA tournament on a 14-game win streak and remains unbeaten in its past 16 contests. In the 16-team field, the Crimson is joined by two fellow ECAC squads, No. 6/6 Union and the Big Red. This year marks Harvard’s 24th tournament appearance and the third consecutive season in which it has vied for the NCAA crown.
The Crimson will be lacing up the skates with the Friars for the first time since Jan. 12, 1984, a matchup Harvard won, 2-0. With a win at Providence’s expense on Friday evening, the Crimson would tie a program record with 15 consecutive victories, a milestone set by the 1988-1989 team that won the national championship.

While this week’s Athlete of the Week honors went to members of the Ivy League Championship winning women’s squash team, four other student-athletes had especially impressive performances this week, earning them Athlete of the Week runners-up honors.
Hunter Ladnier, Jeffrey Ott, Josef Johnson, Wrestling
This weekend, Harvard Wrestling traveled to Lewisburg, Penn. to compete in the 113th EIWA Championships. Though the Crimson earned 10th place as a team, the highlights of the weekend were three bids to the NCAA Tournament in St. Louis earned by senior Jeffrey Ott, junior Josef Johnson, and freshman Hunter Ladnier. Seventh-seeded Ott finished earned spot with a win in the semi-finals over Drexel’s third-seeded Kevin Devoy, who turned his knee mid-match and was forced to default. Earlier this year Ott himself suffered from a knee injury and was unsure whether he’d be able to return to the mat this season, let alone finish second place at the EIWA Championships and earn a coveted bid to the NCAA Championships. Tri-captain Johnson, on the other hand, has performed consistently this season, and added an exclamation point to his wrestling this weekend with his sixth-place finish and NCAA bid. This will be the the New Jersey native’s second trip to the NCAA Championships, as he also qualified as a sophomore. Ott and Johnson will be joined in St. Louis by freshman Ladnier, who performed a rare feat this weekend by becoming the first Harvard rookie to advance to the EIWA finals since 2007. Following two Friday victories, Ladnier split his matches on Saturday. He upset Lehigh’s top ranked senior Laike Gardiner 11-7 in the semi-finals, but fell 8-5 to Princeton senior Jordan Laster in the finals. Still, his performance was enough to book him a ticket to St. Louis for the weekend of March 16-18, where he, Ott, and Johnson will look to prove themselves amongst the best collegiate wrestlers in the country.

As the snow begins to melt away and the first signs of spring touch the air, three former Harvard pitchers are busy training to compete at the next level.
Pitchers Brent Suter, Frank Herrmann, and Sean Poppen all share a background in a Crimson uniform. The three are, however, entering the 2017 spring at various stages of their careers beyond Harvard’s gates. As Suter find himself on a major league roster, Herrmann is transitioning out of MLB and Poppen is settling into minor league play.
After making his major league debut in August of 2016, Suter will be suiting up this season for the Milwaukee Brewers. The 27-year-old left-hander completed the 2016 season with an ERA of 3.32 over 14 games.
Suter, who was drafted in the 31st round of the 2012 Draft by the Brewers, is the only former Harvard baseball player listed as active on an MLB 40-man roster. He currently vying for a spot in the Milwaukee bullpen as the team undergoes spring training.
Right-handed pitcher Frank Herrmann will be on the mound in Japan this year, as he’ll be competing in Nippon Professional Baseball. Coming out of Harvard, Herrmann signed with the Cleveland Indians in 2006. The New Jersey native pitched in the minors for four years, before making his major league debut in June of 2010. While in the major leagues, he spent three seasons with the Indians and one with the Philadelphia Phillies.
Herrmann signed with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in November of last year. This season will mark the first in the NPB for the 32-year-old Harvard alumnus.
Fresh off O’Donnell Field, Poppen will be furthering his baseball career in the minor leagues. After graduating from Harvard last year, the right-handed pitcher went in the 19th round of the 2016 MLB Draft to the Minnesota Twins. He is currently playing Single-A baseball with the Cedar Rapid Kernels in Iowa.
During his time with the Crimson, Poppen had an ERA of 4.39 in 39 appearances and recorded a total of 175 strikeouts.
As these three alumni take to mounds across the globe, a piece of Harvard will travel behind every pitch.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This year for Brooklyn Nets starting point guard and Harvard alum Jeremy Lin has been filled with setbacks and challenges, both individually and team-wise. Having embraced his new role as a veteran leader on a rebuilding team, Lin understood he would face a drastic change in expectations from last season, when he was the sixth man on a playoff-contending Charlotte Hornets. However, two hamstring injuries throughout the year has forced Lin to miss much of the season, playing in only 16 out of 60 games so far.
In a Facebook post on December 19, Lin stated, “ Not gonna lie this season has been very painful physically/mentally/emotionally, not being able to battle with my crew night in night out.... I'm working extremely hard to get right again...thanks again for the love!”
With Lin out, the Nets were forced to depend on former D-League player Spencer Dinwiddie and rookie Isaiah Whitehead to handle point guard duties, but a noticeable lack of chemistry with franchise centerpiece Brook Lopez and prospects like Rondae Hollis-Jefferson and Caris LeVert have left the Nets with a 10-49 record as of March 3, the league’s worst. Unlike most rebuilding teams, the Nets also do not own their lottery draft pick in this year’s upcoming draft (as well as next year’s first-round pick), due to the Kevin Garnett-Paul Pierce trade in 2013.
Facing these circumstances, Lin and the Nets have nevertheless maintained an upbeat mentality throughout much of the season, focusing on player development and building team chemistry. Lin’s teammate Brook Lopez stated that this season feels completely different from his 2009-2010 season, when the Nets finished with a league-worst 12-70 record.
“This has been a completely different mindset and attitude.” Lopez said, “ I think we’re happy that guys aren’t quitting. You can definitely see there’s no quit in us.”
Individually, Lin has played consistently in his few games on the floor, averaging 13.3 points per game and 5.5 assists per game. These numbers have been fairly impressive given he has been put on minutes restrictions for a majority of the 15 games he has played. Off the court, Lin has been an important mentor for the Net’s young core, seen consistently giving out advice to rookies Whitehead and LeVert during games.
For the final post-All Star break stretch, Lin hopes to stay healthy and bring important leadership to a team in need of a sense of direction. Given a lack of games played together with Lopez, Lin is also looking to find a consistent pick-and-roll game with the offensive-minded center.
“It’s nice having Jeremy out there,” head coach Kenny Atkinson said, “Instead of the ball going around haphazardly, he really directs it. I give him a lot of credit.”
The Nets, with little to play for in the final 20 games of the year, will depend on Jeremy Lin to build confidence heading into next season. Through a larger sample size, we may also finally see how Lin fits into Atkinson’s system and the adjustments Lin will make as the starting point guard. So long as Lin’s hamstring issues do not re-emerge, Nets fans should be excited to see why Lin was signed to a 3 year, 36-million dollar deal in the offseason and why he deserves to be the point guard in the near future for the rebuilding Nets.
“I’m realistic enough to understand that we haven’t had a fair look at what this team is really going to look like,” Lin said. “When I come back, I want to be able to help this team and be what they envision me to be. I think post-All-Star break is enough games to see that.”
Jeremy Lin’s fresh start with the Nets may not have taken the most ideal starting path, but it looks like he is right back on track heading into the end of the season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For the Harvard track and field team, there’s no such thing as spring break. Only five days after the NCAA Indoor Championships earlier in the week, the teams were back at it again with two meets commencing the start of the outdoor season.
Traveling down to Houston, Texas, experience won the day as senior Nikki Okwelogu and co-captain Julian Nunally each racked up three gold medals in their respective events.
“It was a great experience to open up the outdoor season alongside most of the team in Houston,” said sophomore pole vaulter and javelin thrower Nicole Trenchard. “The meet was an opportunity to brush off the dust from indoors and compete in some of the events only offered during the outdoor season. On top of a week of incredible weather to train in, it was the perfect way to reset from midterms and the indoor championship season.”
COUGAR SPRING BREAK INVITATIONAL
Hosted by the University of Houston at Tom Tellez Track, the team traveled to the meet to compete as individuals, since the team totals were not being tallied. Despite the lack of team competition, several athletes set personal bests.
Included among those was Nunally, who brought home the gold in discus. It was in his third throw that the senior threw his career best and bested his competition by 19 feet. Tossing the disk a total of 54.81 meters, Nunally obliterated the competition and threw the third best mark in the history of the program. The event was his second of the day. Earlier that morning, Nunally placed fifth in shot put with a toss of 16.3 meters.
In the women’s side of the events, Okwelogu—the recent second team All-American in indoor shot put— claimed two golds of her own. In discus, the veteran won on her second throw with a 49.02 meters. The effort was seven feet further than her closest competitor. In shot put, Okwelogu claimed her second first place medal of the day with a toss of 15.82 meters. However, the senior wasn’t yet done. She went on to compete in the hammer throw and claim fifth with a 50.49-meter effort.
Also throwing for the Harvard women was Trenchard. Participating in the javelin throw, Trenchard’s last throw was her best with a 34.55-meter heave. The effort would be good enough to earn the sophomore a silver medal. She would also compete in the pole vault competition earning a fourth place finish with a 3.55-meter jump.
“I was disappointed with my performances” Trenchard said. “They didn't reflect the changes I've made recently in practice, but I'm really looking forward to putting all of the pieces together in the coming weeks.”
Freshman Simi Fajemisin would be the final women’s competitor to place in the top three with a 5.80-meter effort to land herself in the third position in long jump.
Also claiming silver was another sophomore, this time for the men. Ian West participated pole vault for the team and with his 4.75-meter jump, would do well enough to grab second for the team.
The hurdling events went particularly well for Harvard. In the the 400-meter variation, two freshman placed in the top two. For the women’s team, freshman Karina Joiner took gold with a 1.01.88 second effort, just edging out the freshman from Houston, Birexus Hawkins, who finished just .16 seconds behind her. For the men, freshman Jacob McLennan took home the silver medal with a 54.24 second finish.
In the women’s 100-meter hurdles, it was almost all Harvard. Claiming the spots two through four, the team finished with a spread of just .1 seconds. Leading off for the group was freshman Livia Gauntlett who took silver with a time of 14.02 seconds, just .07 behind the leader. Senior Jade Miller followed right behind with a time of 14.1 and freshman Karina Joiner behind her at 14.12 seconds.
“It was great to get the outdoor season underway in Texas following a productive week of practice,” Guantlett said. “The season opener is a great way to see where we are in terms of training and preparation for the rest of the season. After finishing the indoor season successfully at the Ivy League Championships, we have good foundations to work upon during the upcoming season. It was an honor to represent Harvard at the first outdoor event, and I hope to continue to build upon my first performance throughout the rest of the season.”
Taking fourth for the women in the 200-meter dash was senior Jade Miller. The veteran posted a time of 24.64 to claim the spot.
For the men’s team, the long distance events saw a lot more success than the shorter runs. Junior Gabe Montague ran his first ever 3000-meter outdoors race and took home the gold with a time of 8:54.31 seconds. In the 2000-meter steeplechase, freshman Will Battershill also got first place as he ran the event in a time of 6:03.72.
TEXAS SOUTHERN RELAYS
The following day, members of the team traveled to the Texas Southern Relays hosted at the university’s Alexander Durely Stadium. There, Okwelogu and Nunally again excelled.
Claiming her third gold medal of the weekend, Okwelogu won discus with a season best throw of 53.8 meters. She won the meet by exactly 12 feet. On the men’s side, Nunally picked up two more gold medals, giving him also three on the weekend. In discus, the co-captain won first with a throw of 48.28 meters, just under 12 feet ahead of his closest competition. Nunally also won shot put on his fourth toss of the meet, a throw of of 16.42 meters.
Also in men’s shot put, freshman Gunnar Allison claimed his medal with a throw of 14.19 meters, leading to a fourth place finish. Classmate McLennan, competing in the 400-meter hurdles, took the fifth place position with a time of 54.76 seconds.
“I am very excited to see what the outdoor season holds for us,” Trenchard said. “The women's program has become more and more of a contender on the national stage, and it has been incredible to be a part of a team that is constantly climbing in rankings and breaking records.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the Charleston Spring Coed Regatta on March 11 and 12, the Crimson sailing team claimed a first place finish by a margin of four points over the second place Georgetown Hoyas.
The field of 18 teams included local rivals MIT, Yale, and Boston University as well as West Coast competitors Stanford University, Santa Barbara City College, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and the University of Hawaii.
Heading into the regatta, the organizers and the teams expected a mild breeze but were instead treated to alternating gusts from the north and east for the first few hours of the morning. The resulting delay kept the regatta landed until 1 p.m.
Once the sailing picked back up, Harvard came out strong. Junior Nick Sertl and Sophomore Christine Gosioco kicked off the Crimson’s weekend in the A-Division race with top-five finishes in eight of the first nine races on the first day.
On Sunday, as the wind picked up and maintained high speeds throughout the day, Sertl and Gosioco paired up with Freshman Jessica Williams and Senior Nomin-Erdene Jagdagdorj. The high winds proved detrimental to the pairs as they finished near the middle of the pack in each of their eight races.
On Saturday in the B-Division, Sophomore Nick Karnovsky and Senior Julia Lord also had a dominant first day of racing.
In eight of their first nine races, Karnovsky and Lord kept themselves in the top five on the way to helping give the Crimson a two point lead over Georgetown to end the first day of competition.
On Sunday, Karnovsky and Lord battled the high winds alongside the teammates that they were paired with, Junior Kevin Coakley and Jessica Williams. Showing off their ability to perform consistently in all conditions, the team notched four top-fifteen finishes in nine races.
“Wind delay is not uncommon in sailing,” Sophomore Christine Gosioco said. “And Nick and Julia sailed really well once the racing resumed.”
Following such an impressive display, the New England Intercollegiate Sailing Association (NEISA) named the B-Division team of Karnovsky, Lord, Coakley and Williams their Sailors of the Week in a press release on their website.
“The B-division team from Harvard won two of the seventeen races and had nearly all top ten finishes,” the NEISA’s press release said. “Their consistency in a wide range of conditions lead Harvard to the overall win.”
They contributed 95 points to Harvard’s total of 175 with the remaining 80 points coming from the A-Division team of Sertl, Gosioco, Jagdagdorj, and Williams.
“We’re happy with the result,” Gosioco said. “Sailing at Charleston was a good experience because it is a different type of venue from what we’re used to. For example, current was a large factor that we had to consider.”
The Geiger Trophy Team Race at MIT was ultimately canceled due to poor racing conditions.
After difficult conditions on day one, the Geiger Regatta was cut short due to “terrible weather” on the second day. Harvard was able to secure a second place finish before the regatta was called early.
“I was a little relieved that we wouldn’t be racing today in conditions that were even colder and even worse than Saturday’s,” Gosioco said. “On the other hand, it’s unfortunate because, combined with the cancellation of the Sharpe Trophy Team Race, we’ve had fewer opportunities compared to previous seasons to race against other schools in a competition setting.”
The nine-team field featured mostly local, in-conference competitors like Northeastern, Boston University, University of Rhode Island, Yale, Tufts, and host MIT.
Last season, the Crimson finished in the middle of the pack at the Geiger Regatta. In an eight team field, Harvard placed fifth. Two years ago, the Geiger Regatta suffered a similar fate to this year’s event, as it was canceled after the Boston region received record amounts of snowfall late in winter.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The No. 20 Harvard women’s water polo team finished its West Coast road trip with a 4-3 record, closing out the week with a strong win over Fresno Pacific, a pair of tough losses to No. 9 Pacific and No. 14 San Jose State, and an overtime victory against Santa Clara.
“We really came together as a team this trip both in and out of the pool,” freshman Julie Harrison said. “All the games and training helped us develop and refine our game, in addition to providing some great team bonding experiences.”
NO. 20 HARVARD, 9, SANTA CLARA, 8
In the Crimson’s final game on its West Coast road trip, Harvard (8-9, 0-1 CWPA) defeated Santa Clara (5-14) 9-8 in a double overtime game on Saturday afternoon. Entering the last quarter down one point, senior Zoe Osborne, sophomore Haley Bowe, sophomore Kristen Hong and freshman Sofia Carrera-Justiz each found the back of the net in the final quarter to send the game into overtime.
In the first overtime period, both teams failed to score. In the second, three minute overtime, Junior Sami Strutner took the feed from Carrera-Justiz to score the game-winning goal with 1:10 remaining.
“We were very happy to come out with an OT win against Santa Clara despite having a few slip ups in the 4th quarter,” Hong said. “The California trip in general was a good growing experience for our team. It allowed us to pinpoint the flaws in the implementation of our system and this allowed us to improve throughout the trip.”
NO. 14 SAN JOSE ST., 5, NO. 20 HARVARD, 3
In a closely-contested matchup against No. 14 San Jose St. (9-13), the Crimson came out to a 2-1 lead early in the first half. However, the Spartans outscored Harvard 3-0 in the second quarter, resulting in a 4-2 halftime score.
After the intermission, the two teams scored on a piece, resulting in the second loss on the weekend. In the low scoring game, junior goaltender Cleo Harrington had 11 saves in the net. Hong, Carrera-Justiz and senior Michelle Martinelli scored the Crimson’s three goals.
NO. 9 PACIFIC, 9, NO. 20 HARVARD, 5
Harvard played a strong first half against No. 9 Pacific (12-7), taking an early 2-0 lead. At the end of the first quarter, the team had held the Tigers at 2-2. By the halftime, Harvard trailed, but only by one goal. Ultimately, the Crimson was unable to pull off the upset against its top-10 opponent, falling 9-5 on Wednesday night.
Despite the loss, Harrington was a bright spot for the team. Racking up double-digit saves, the junior posted a good night against Pacific. With 12 saves, two assists and a steal, Harrington kept the score close throughout the match.
NO. 20 HARVARD, 14, FRESNO PACIFIC, 4
Dominating from the start of the game, Harvard took a quick 5-0 lead over Fresno Pacific (12-7) as the first quarter came to a close on Tuesday night. By halftime, the lead had increased to eight with the Crimson holding the 9-1 advantage. The second half served only to expand this lead with Harvard maintaining a 5-3 advantage throughout the final periods, easily defeating their opponent in the 14-4 victory.
A team effort, nine different players scored goals for the Crimson to lead the team to a double digit win. Continuing on her strong performance earlier in the trip, Carrera-Justiz led with three goals while teammates Martinelli, Hong, and freshman Mathilde Ribordy all netted two of their own.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Following a hot start to its 2017 season, the Harvard women’s softball team (8-9) faltered in Honolulu, Hawaii at the Rainbow Wahine Classic, losing six of its seven contests.
The Crimson dropped three of its games by five, seven, and eight runs, but the other three defeats were all one-run margins. Connecticut (9-14) delivered the final blow to Harvard in the ultimate game of the tournament, rallying to tie the game in the top of the seventh and tacking on a run in the eighth to pick up an extra innings victory.
The Crimson’s lone win in the Classic was a 7-3 triumph over Purdue (10-21). Sophomore Sarah Smith got the start on the mound and shut down the Boilermakers over the first four innings. Co-captain Giana Panariello hit her first homerun of the season, and junior outfielder Dallas Hogan scored three times to fuel Harvard’s offense.
All told, Harvard played 12 games in nine days between the Long Beach State Tournament and the Rainbow Wahine Classic.
“Playing a 12 game schedule within a week long period requires a great deal of grit out of a team, but that's why we do it, in order to prepare for the competition to come,” senior righthander Taylor Cabe said. “Moving forward into the rest of our season, we're excited to act upon the grit and experience we gained over break to make a strong run in the Ivy League.”
CONNECTICUT 5, HARVARD 4
Out of the Crimson’s six losses at the Rainbow Wahine Classic, this defeat was perhaps the most heartbreaking. On the heels of a 10-2 drubbing by Hawaii, Harvard looked to rebound and close out the tournament with a win.
A win appeared likely after the Crimson took a lead for the first time in the bottom of the sixth. Freshman Chanel Varney pinch ran for senior designated hitter Catherine Callaway, and she advanced to third base on a sac bunt and a wild pitch. Sophomore shortstop Rhianna Rich came up in the clutch with an RBI single, and Harvard headed to the final inning with a one-run lead in hand.
However, the Huskies rebounded immediately and plated a run on a Carissa Brizzi single to right field. The Crimson failed to score in the last half of the seventh, and Harvard found itself in its first extra innings contest of the season.
The Crimson’s hopes were not alive for long, as Connecticut efficiently dispatched of Harvard in one frame. A sacrifice fly plated sophomore Ally Hernandez, and sophomore righthander Jill Stockley finished off Harvard in the bottom of the eighth to secure the win.
“I’ll put it in the words of our coach, that’s just about timely hitting,” Leslie said. “If we would have had three more timely hits in those [one-run] games they could have gone either way. While we lost six of our games in Hawaii, we competed with all of these teams, and on any given day we could have beaten them.”
Rich went three-for-four with an RBI and a run scored.
Following the close defeat in the tournament’s final game, Crimson softball looked at its grueling spring break as a positive for the road ahead.
“The goal of our spring break series every year is to come back battle-tested and prepared for Ivy League play,” Cabe said. “We certainly accomplished that goal in California and Hawaii this year playing against excellent competition.”
HAWAII 10, HARVARD 2 (5 inn.)
The Rainbows (21-10) only needed five innings to dispatch Harvard in the teams’ second meeting at the Classic.
Fatigue on the part of the Crimson’s pitchers may have been a factor in this contest. The sophomore duo of Smith and Duncan, having both pitched earlier in the day in Harvard’s win over Purdue, were called upon again to face a potent Hawaii offense.
The top of the Rainbows’ order once again was a large part of the Crimson’s downfall. Third baseman Nicole Lopez continued to confound Harvard’s hurlers, as the freshman went deep, scored twice, and drove in two runs.
Senior first baseman Jillian Leslie left the yard with a two-run shot to left center in the top of the fourth. The home run was her first of the season.
HARVARD 7, PURDUE 3
In its rematch with Purdue, the Crimson reversed its fortunes from the previous day. This time, Harvard limited the Boilermakers to three runs and it tacked on seven of its own, the most it scored in the seven-game set.
Three runs in the top of the second put the Crimson in the driver’s seat for good, as Harvard did not allow Purdue to claim the lead at any point in the game. Panariello kicked off the scoring with a solo homer. Three singles, a walk, and a hit-by-pitch brought in the other two.
Smith went four strong innings in the circle, allowing only one run and striking out two. The win improved the Somerset, N.J. native’s record to 4-1 on the season. Cabe and Duncan combined to finish off Purdue in the final three frames.
Errors seemed to plague the Boilermakers in their two games against the Crimson. In this contest, Purdue committed six errors to add to the three defensive miscues from its earlier 8-3 win.
PURDUE 8, HARVARD 3
Too little, too late was the story of Harvard’s 8-3 loss to Purdue on the third day of the tournament.
Smith and Duncan each pitched 1.2 innings and struggled against a potent Boilermakers lineup. Smith, the starter, was pulled after walking four, and Duncan allowed seven hits and five earned runs.
Cabe stabilized the Crimson in the circle, but Harvard could not push across enough runs to overcome a seven-run deficit. Sophomore center fielder Kaitlyn Schiffhauer knocked in three with a bases-clearing single in the bottom of the fifth.
MARIST 3, HARVARD 2
A comeback in the bottom of the seventh could not save the Crimson from its second one-run defeat of the tournament.
Leslie kickstarted the inning with a double down the left field line, and she later scored on two wild pitches. Two outs later, Harvard found itself with runners on second and third, down a run. However, Callaway took strike three looking to end the game.
“While it didn’t come out in our favor, it showed the grit that we had,” Leslie said. “We’re going to push through tough losses and tough games, and that’s going to happen in Ivies. We play three of the [Ivy League] teams four times in a weekend, so that’s about being gritty and being able to push through in the seventh inning when you face the same team and the same pitchers four times in a row.”
Coach Jenny Allard handed the ball Duncan in the circle to start the game. The Allendale, N.J. native spread nine hits over 4.2 innings and only allowed two earned runs. On the opposing side, Marist senior righthander Jayne Oberdorf went the distance, striking out four.
Schiffhauer tallied two hits in three at bats, including a double and an RBI.
HAWAII 7, HARVARD 0
The Crimson fell victim to a shutout in the second game of the Rainbow Wahine Classic, as it was unable to mount any offense against Hawaii starter Brittany Hitchcock.
Hitchcock silenced Harvard’s bats all day, throwing a complete game shutout. The junior from Huntington Beach, Calif. Allowed only four hits, all singles, and got 10 of her 21 outs via strikeout.
The Rainbows were not entirely reliant upon Hitchcock’s performance to secure the win, however. Hawaii scored seven runs on a whopping 14 hits, including four doubles. Sophomore Nicole Lopez contributed two of those doubles and drove in two.
Hogan stole second base in the top of the third. Her four steals are the second-most on the team thus far.
Hawaii and the other teams in the Rainbow Wahine Classic provided the Crimson with a tougher, but much-needed challenge early on in its season.
“In Hawaii we faced a lot of teams that had great offenses,” Leslie said. “Definitely the level of competition in Hawaii was a lot higher, but it challenged us in ways that we really needed going forward.”
CONNECTICUT 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard opened up its Hawaii trip with a close loss at the hands of the University of Connecticut, 4-3. Harvard outhit the Huskies, 7-3, but a two-run home run in the first inning off the bat of senior Taylor Townsend and some small ball in the bottom of the fifth carried Connecticut to a victory.
Following Townsend’s round-tripper in the bottom of the first, the Crimson battled back for two runs of its own in the top of the second. Leslie contributed a pinch-hit single with the bases loaded to bring in one, and Rich followed with a single of her own to plate another.
Two defensive miscues contributed to the tying and winning runs for the Huskies. An error by the second baseman and a wild pitch put runners on second and third with no outs, and a sac bunt and a single brought the runs in.
Junior center fielder Maddy Kaplan was two-for-three and contributed a sac bunt which led to Varney’s run in the top of the fifth.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At the end of last week, the Harvard men’s volleyball team (6-10, 3-4 EIVA) flew to California with high hopes for competition with top West Coast programs.
The Crimson did play three matches but failed to produce a victory in either one. Facing No. 7 UCLA (13-7), No. 14 USC (9-12), and No. 15 UC Santa Barbara (10-11), Harvard ended its long trip with three defeats to volleyball powerhouses.
The losses came in different ways—a three-set sweep, a vacated 2-0 lead, and a five-set seesaw match. The overall moral remained the same, though: The Crimson can compete with top programs but struggles to seal the deal.
No. 14 USC 3, HARVARD 2
In the Crimson’s last game in California before returning home, the team was determined to finish the trip on a high note. After dropping a two-set lead in Santa Barbara, Calif., Harvard went into Galen Center with a newfound focus to finish out each set and not give up big leads.
However, early inspiration proved insufficient. A tough back-and-forth match between the Crimson and the Trojans ended with the hosts emerging victorious thanks to a 15-8 fifth set. So it was that Harvard flew back to Cambridge without a victory.
Co-captain Casey White led the Crimson with 12 kills on the contest. Meanwhile USC relied on sophomore outside hitter Gianluca Grasso, who posted 18 kills on a .300 hitting efficiency.
Although the Trojans took the first set by a score of 25-16, Harvard stormed back in the second with a 25-19 win. The back-and-forth battled continued into the next two frames, as the two teams again traded sets, with USC winning 25-18 and the Crimson triumphing 25-22.
The hot-and-cold nature of the match reflected attacking inconsistency for Harvard. In the five sets, the Crimson posted hitting percentages of .192, .423, .160, .306, and -.267—in other words a back-and-forth affair.
No. 15 UCSB 3, HARVARD 2
Shaking off a blowout loss in Los Angeles to start the trip, Harvard started hot against the Gauchos, claiming two sets. However, the Crimson was unable to seal the victory, conceding the next three frames.
Once again, White topped the Crimson with a career-high 19 kills. He did so on a hitting efficiency of .246. Junior Hayden Boehle and freshman Roy McFarland led the way for Santa Barbara, combining for 26 finishes.
Looking at the contest as a whole, the two teams played to similar statistics. While Harvard posted a slightly higher killing percentage, the Guachos were only .030 behind with a mark of .243.
In the last set of the match, Harvard held a 14-12 advantage and the chance to put away the match. However, Santa Barbara battled back to force a two-point run off. Ultimately the Gauchos crushed Crimson hopes with a 4-1 run that sealed the result.
No. 7 UCLA 3, HARVARD 0
California in March can be hot. UCLA volleyball can be even hotter.
In Harvard’s first game on the West Coast, the Bruins overwhelmed the visitors, posting a hitting percentage of .560. Although the Crimson hit at a respectable clip of .294, no offensive output could match UCLA, which hit with force all contest.
Harvard did not record a single block in the contest, which evidenced the defensive struggles. The performance came as a disappointing showing for a team that headed into the West Coast part of its schedule after a three-set win in its previous match.
No Crimson player reached a double-digit kill total. White paced the squad with seven finishes, but those points came despite an overall kill percentage of .143.
On the other side of the net, seven Bruins hit at least .500 to contribute to a potent attack that racked up 46 kills on 75 attempts.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Over spring break, the Harvard men’s tennis team traveled across the country to train and compete in sunny California. The squad took on UC Irvine on March 13 before facing Iowa, San Diego State, and Drake in the Mission Valley Spring Classic tournament from March 16 through 18.
“The team overall performed pretty well,” junior Grant Solomon said. “We are putting in the hard work every day and we are trusting the process in every sense of that phrase.”
DRAKE 4, HARVARD 2
In its final match of the Mission Valley Spring Classic in La Jolla, Calif., the Crimson (9-8) squad took on the Bulldogs (11-8).
Saturday’s matchup against Drake marked the first time Harvard has given up the doubles point in six matches. The powerhouse doubles duo of senior Brian Yeung and junior Kenny Tao earned a win at first doubles, moving to 11-5 this season. The Crimson failed to close out the doubles point, however, as the second and third doubles teams fell in close tiebreakers.
Going into singles play, the outlook appeared bleak as five Harvard players gave up their first sets and Tao fell at first singles. Two wins from co-captain Jean Thirouin and Solomon gave the team hope, however, as it advanced to 3-2.
Thirouin’s, 7-6, 7-5, win at second singles earned him a perfect, 4-0, singles record for the team’s California trip. Solomon battled back at fifth singles after losing the first set in a neck-and-neck tiebreaker, taking the next two sets, 6-3, 6-4.
“The match literally went from impossible, to improbable, to possible,” Solomon said.
Ultimately, the Bulldogs won the deciding sixth singles match. Sophomore Chris Morrow took the first set, 6-4, before falling, 5-7, in the second set. The third set went into a tiebreaker, with Drake junior Bayo Philips pulling ahead to clinch the point.
“[The match] was something we should be proud of,” Solomon said. “But the journey is just getting started. No one said it was going to be easy, it's not what we signed up for. Hard work is just the price of admission.”
HARVARD 4, SAN DIEGO STATE 1
With two decisive wins from its second and third doubles teams, the Crimson took the doubles point to start the match against the Aztecs (5-10) off with an advantage.
On the singles side, after Morrow fell to his San Diego State opponent at sixth singles, straight-set wins from Thirouin and sophomore Andy Zhou put Harvard ahead at 3-1. For the match-clinching victory, Tao overcame a close tiebreaker in the first set and won his second set, 6-4, to give the Crimson the 4-1 victory.
IOWA 4, HARVARD 2
The matchup between the Harvard and the Hawkeyes (10-6) started off with a contentious doubles point. After the duo of Morrow and rookie Logan Weber clinched a victory at third doubles, improving their record to 10-3, first doubles pair Yeung and Tao fell, 6-4. It came down to the duo of co-captains Thirouin and Sebastian Beltrame, and they prevailed with a tiebreaker win over their Iowa opponents, granting the Crimson the doubles point.
The Hawkeyes came back with wins at sixth singles against Solomon and first singles against Beltrame. Harvard fought on though, as Thirouin took a straight-set victory at fourth singles, his seventh singles victory of the season, to knot the match at 2-2.
“We are playing gritty, blue collar, pack your lunch tennis - nothing flashy, nothing extra,” Solomon said. “We are ready to shake things up.”
After Tao fell, 6-2, 6-4, at second singles, it came down to Zhou’s match at fifth singles. Zhou was unable to best Iowa sophomore Jonas Larsen, however, and the Hawkeyes clinched the 4-2 win.
HARVARD 4, UC IRVINE 3
The Crimson took a quick lead against the Anteaters (6-10) in its spring break opener with a doubles sweep. No. 40 doubles duo Tao and Yeung edged out their opponents at first singles, Beltrame and Thirouin won, 6-4, at second doubles, and Morrow and Weber managed to close out the sweep with a tiebreaker win at third doubles.
Harvard and UC Irvine split the singles matches, all in straight sets, and the doubles advantage gave the Crimson the win. Thirouin, Zhou, and Solomon at third, fourth, and fifth singles, respectively, earned crucial points for Harvard.
The team will return to the courts next weekend with three matches at home, in preparation for the Ivy season.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At Rollins College, the Harvard women’s lacrosse team (4-2) came within one point of completing a momentous overtime comeback against No. 6 Syracuse (8-2).
Despite facing a 10-6 deficit in the first half, the Crimson fought its way back to tie the score at 16-all and force an overtime period. However, that come-from-behind effort proved fruitless, as the Orange nabbed a final score to escape with a 17-16 victory in Winter Park, Fla.
“Since the beginning of the season our team goal has been to win the Ivy title,” sophomore attacker Caroline Garrity said. “Losing in overtime to Syracuse...was tough, but it will not distract us from our focus.”
The Saturday game was underscored by aggressive play from both Harvard and Syracuse, with nine yellow cards (four by the Crimson and five by the Orange) and 57 fouls (25 by Harvard and 32 by Syracuse. Physical tenacity led to sloppy offense at times, as the two teams combined for 18 turnovers.
Even so, the contest sparkled with flashes of drama.
With less than a minute remaining on the clock, Syracuse scored to take a 16-15 lead. However, the Crimson responded with sophomore attacker Nicole Baiocco tying the game and completing a hat trick with seconds left to play. These late heroics forced the sudden-death period.
Despite Harvard’s best efforts, though, the Orange triumphed with 2:20 remaining in overtime. The heart-wrenching result was a 17-16 win for the top-10 Syracuse team.
Overall, the Crimson led the Orange 32-24 in shots on goals, forcing 16 Syracuse saves. By contrast, Syracuse forced junior goalie Meredith Brown to make seven stops.
The Crimson defense was crucial for the regulation-time comeback. Harvard was 13-for-13 in clearing its zone, squashing critical opportunities for scores. Also, the Crimson boasted an 11-7 advantage in ground balls, with senior defender Emma Ford leading the charge with four scoops.
The second half started fast as Harvard and the Orange traded goals. Captain Megan Hennessy and junior midfielder Julia Glynn each scored to narrow the Syracuse lead to 12-8. A pair of Syracuse scores threatened to reopen the chasm, but senior captain and attacker Marisa Romeo responded with two of her three goals on the day within minutes of each other to bring the score to 14-10.
With 14 minutes to play, the Crimson faced a four-goal lead. And playing with renewed energy, Harvard closed that gap, scoring six more goals in regulation to force overtime.
Several players recorded standout performances. Romeo’s third goal meant a fourth consecutive hat trick n. During the final minutes of regulation time, Glynn also recorded a hat trick and sophomore midfielder Keeley MacAfee nabbed two goals to level the match at 15-15.
Despite the Orange having the draw control advantage 18-16 over the Crimson as well as causing three turnovers for Harvard, the Crimson caused two turnovers and McMahon won seven draw controls while senior midfielder and Hennessy collected four.
The match started in exhilarating fashion as Harvard and Syracuse opened scoring early. The first goal of the match came from Syracuse less than a minute into play. Then three minutes later, senior captain and attacker Maeve McMahon got the Crimson on the board with a first score.
Back and forth the match continued in the opening period until the two teams stood at a 3-3 impasse. Then came a barrage of Orange offense. Syracuse pressed ahead with a flurry of shots and mounted an 8-4 lead during the first half. Although Harvard got within 8-6 thanks to two goals from Baiocco, Syracuse scored two more times before halftime for the 10-6 advantage.
“Such a heartbreaking loss only confirms that we are a very competitive team,” Garrity said. “[The loss] makes us even more determined to work harder to achieve our goal.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Doing what she does best, sophomore sprinter Gabby Thomas arrived at the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships and etched her name into the record books again. Coming close to her own—and consequently the school’s—200-meter sprint record, she advanced to the finals in the event. Thomas is the first student athlete from any Ivy League school to do so at the meet.
For the group of Harvard representatives, the meet was a successful one overall, with three participants placing in the top 11 of their respective events and those same three going home with All-American awards. Donning the crimson and white were four representatives from the women’s team. Two freshmen made an appearance with Zoe Hughes in the pentathlon and Judy Pendergast in the 5000-meter. Veterans senior Nikki Okwelogu and Thomas suited up for the shot put and the 200-meter, respectively.
Thomas had the most successful outing of the group. Running the semi-finals in the fourth and last heat of the 200-meter sprint, the sophomore knew prior to the race that she had to clock a 23-second sprint to advance to a round untouched by any from the Ancient Eight. As is characteristic of the runner, she rose to the occasion. Clocking a time just .01 seconds behind her 200-meter sprint record, Thomas advanced with a time of 22.89.
“The biggest goal I have is my mindset,” Thomas said. “It can be intimidating to be an underdog competing against schools that are known to form such powerful sprinters, so just constantly reminding myself that I need to work hard where I am to earn my spot next.”
The second day would not be as fruitful for the Florence, Mass., native. Running in the second heat of the finals for the race, Thomas ran 23:35 to place fourth in her heat, and eighth overall. It was Ariana Washington, a representative from the University of Oregon, that won the event with a time of 22:42. With the eighth place finish, Thomas claimed her a first team All-American recognition. The honor is the second of her career at Harvard. The sophomore also took home first team All-American honors in the outdoor variation of the event during the 2016 season.
Not just a great runner, Thomas also exceeds as a leader for the team.
“Gabby is the person on the team that I look up to the most,” said freshman sprinter and teammate Micah Meekins. “She is always pushing us to do our best and work our hardest so that we can all achieve our goals. I aspire to as great as she is and to be much as an influence to future runners as she has been to me. She has been a role model to me and is always there when I need encouraging words and advice on running.”
Representing Harvard in the pentathlon was Hughes, only the second athlete in school history to don the crimson and white in the event at the NCAA Indoor Championships. The freshman was only one of three rookies competing in the event and placed 10th overall with 4089 points. The score represents the third best in Harvard’s history. Along the way to the tenth place finish, the freshman broke personal records in both shot put and the 800-meter run. In shot put, she placed third overall with a personal best throw of 12.73 meters. In the 800, the feat was repeated with a 2:19.81 run. For her efforts, Hughes took home second team All-American honors.
The other rookie did not fare as well. Starting out her race in the front group, Pendergast fell behind as the race progressed due to an injury. Following the race, she was rule to have impeded a runner and was subsequently disqualified from placing. This unfortunate event for the runner is particularly tragic considering her first place run at the Ivy League Heptagonal Championships. With the time she clocked in that race, a 16.07.26, the freshman would have placed 13th in the event.
In contrast to the new faces of freshmen at the meet, was veteran Okwelogu. Appearing in her third straight NCAA Indoor Championships, the senior was more weathered than most. For Okwelogu, it was her first throw in shot put that would be her best. With a toss of 16.13 meters, she claimed the eleventh position on the leader board and a second team All-American award. For the senior, the makes three All-American mentions total. Okwelogu is the first woman in program history to achieve the feat.
The successful NCAA Indoor Championships only cap off an even more successful indoor season for the women’s track and field team. The Harvard women’s team sent its largest group of athletes to the Indoor Championships ever, with four. Coincidentally, the same number of records fell this season at the hands of the women’s team. Thomas took down the records in both the 60-meter and 200-meter dashes as freshman Simi Fajemisin broke records in the triple jump and long jump. The celebrations will be short lived though, as the outdoor season has already begun. With it begins again the long trek towards another appearance at NCAA Championships.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s golf team joined thousands of college students as they traveled south to Florida for spring break. Only rather than party on a beach, their intentions were all business. Following a week of practices, the time in Florida culminated in a scrimmage against Lynn University on Thursday, March 16th. The Crimson would fall 4.5 to 3.5 in their first match of the spring season against the NCAA Division II’s second best team.
Though the match counted for nothing in terms of Harvard’s record, it was a great way for players to wear off the rust that had gathered over the extended period of time away from a playable golf course. It was also an opportunity for all eight teammates to compete for a spot to play in the team’s first tournament of the spring, the Furman Intercollegiate on March 24th, one of only three scheduled tournaments the team has this spring.
Against Lynn though, Harvard found quality competition. On the weekend, they squared off against some of the top golfers in the country, including Toto Gana out of Santiago, Chile. It was Gana who won the South American Amateur tournament, a victory that qualified him to compete for the green jacket in the US Masters next month.
On the Harvard side, junior Greg Royston, led the Crimson in terms of scoring, the South African shooting a 69. Royston and senior Robert Deng, who shot for a score of 73, are ranked as two of the top three players in the Ivy League coming into the spring season. For the Crimson, Deng is ranked number one and Royston number two.
“Greg is a guy that the team looks up to for leadership,” sophomore Aurian Capart said. “He worked very hard during the winter and it makes us happy to see his hard work pay off. He had a great day.”
Capart, a Brussels native, shot a 75 himself and the other sophomore, Seiya Liu, finished the scrimmage one shot better with a score of 74. Senior Kendrick Vinar shot a 73, while captain Daniel De La Garza shot for a score of 80. Freshman Ryan Rhee ended the match with 83 shots and fellow freshman Rij Patel finished up play with a score of 77.
Concerning the loss, Capart was not too worried. Instead, he noted the importance of getting this type of practice, real match practice, before the tournaments. And Capart knows the importance of performing at timely moments. In the Ivy League Championships last year his, and his teammates’, performance helped Harvard to claim its first Ivy League Championship in 41 years. However, he is quick to recognize the talent on the other side, particularly so at Lynn.
“These guys play all year, and we can see that in their play,” Capart said. “They have the sharpness that is hard to maintain from playing inside during the winter. There’s a reason why they are the best in their division.”
With the week of golf over, the players look forward to the tournament in Greenville this weekend, and on improving from the day out with the Lynn squad.
"It was a great day with a great group of guys from Lynn and scrimmaging with them definitely helped us figure out what we need to work on before the upcoming tournament next week," Liu said.
With the season concentrated in just three tournaments, scrimmages like this one give the Crimson a reality check, to see where they are individually and as a team.
Those traveling to South Carolina include Deng, Royston, Liu, Capart, and Vinar. They leave on Wednesday to prepare for the weekend tournament at Furman.
“The team performed really well considering it was our first match like situation in a while,” Capart said. “I think we can take many positives from the match with Lynn and the week in general. We are excited for the season to begin and we hope to keep improving throughout.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Sunday, playing in the second round of the WNIT tournament, the Harvard women’s basketball team (21-9, 8-6 Ivy) mounted an impressive fourth quarter comeback but fell short against St. John’s (22-11, 11-7 Big East). In its final game of the season, the Crimson lost, 62-57, despite strong performances from a young core of players.
“We just didn’t come out with enough intensity and heart,” freshman guard Katie Benzan said. “[St. John’s] did. They came out running and gunning, and you could definitely see that they really wanted to win this game. They wanted to win it from the start.”
From the tip-off, St. John’s had no interest in keeping the game close. Living up to the Red Storm name, St. John’s shots fell like rain, as Harvard could not seem to buy a basket.
After 1:43 of play, freshman Jeannie Boehm converted one of two free throws to put the Crimson up by one. That moment marked the last time that Harvard held a lead. The Red Storm finished that first quarter up 19-9.
However, Harvard would not go away without a fight. Classmates Benzan and Boehm scored 13 and 11 points, respectively. Benzan added seven assists, while Boehm was a force in the front court, swatting away seven shot attempts.
“We’re young,” coach Kathy Delaney-Smith said. “Sometimes that serves a great purpose because they’re clueless, and then sometimes it’s your demon. We’ve been very inconsistent.”
Besides the dependable play of sophomore Sydney Skinner, who posted 10 points and four assists, there was not much support for the dynamic freshman duo. Benzan received no break on the night, playing all 40 minutes as field general in the do-or-die matchup.
Despite Harvard’s experience with more athletic teams, the Crimson had not faced an opponent so dynamic since the team began conference play. Moreover, a first-round matchup with New Hampshire—a program that relies on skill rather than physical prowess— set up the Crimson for a long night.
“St. Johns was a little bit more athletic, and they just had a different team dynamic,” Benzan said. “They had two really good posts, and then they have guards who could rise and pull up over us. They just played a different game than New Hampshire…. St. John’s was just one-on-one, almost streetball.”
The Red Storm’s more physical play forced Harvard to react, and that adjustment proved to be too much, especially for the young forward from Illinois.
“As soon as the scout was out on [Jeannie Boehm], she needed to develop her inside game and again get used to the physicality of the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “That is probably the biggest factor for Jeannie. She might have thought that she wants to slash and shoot the three...but she’s so good inside that she will be a force to be reckoned with for the next three years.”
Going into the fourth quarter down 47-36, the Crimson seemed destined for a quiet exit. But Harvard fought back to introduce some late drama.
Boehm became a force to be reckoned with as she blocked five shots in the last period alone. Unfortunately, the more physical play cost her, as she fouled out after three whistles in the final quarter.
Collectively, the Crimson outscored the Red Storm 21-15 in the final frame, but that push could not overcome previous pitfalls. Two hundred miles from home, Harvard saw its season come to a close.
As difficult as the loss proved for the Crimson, the next chapter for the talented underclassmen offers real promise.
“We had a great run,” Benzan said. “Having this year under our belt, all of us know how to play together and know the in’s and out’s of our teammates. This year was a little bit of a bumpy road, but I think next year we’ll just know how to play together better.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard women’s tennis team kicked off spring break with a pair of wins, as the Crimson triumphed over both Stony Brook and Providence at the Murr Center on March 11.
Harvard only lost one matchup in the doubleheader, besting the Seawolves, 6-1, and shutting out the Friars (4-8), 7-0. The victory over Providence was a repeat performance, as the Crimson (9-5) took last year’s contest by the same margin.
The most recent match against Stony Brook (3-6) came two years ago in the spring of 2015. The Crimson was the victor in that contest as well, 5-2.
“Our goal is to go 5-0 during the spring break period, and going 2-0 was the first step,” Harvard coach Traci Green said.
HARVARD, 6, STONY BROOK, 1
In the first doubles slot, captain June Lee and sophomore Erica Oosterhout bested the Seawolves’ first doubles tandem, Yana Nikolaeva and Ester Chikvashvili, in a 6-1 win. A duo of Harvard sophomores, Isabel Jasper and Sabrina Xiong, made quick work of Ana Carrion-Rodriguez and Amanda Foo in the third position, prevailing 6-0.
“The doubles was always the missing ingredient, and now we feel like if we come out strong from the blocks, we can beat any team in the country,” Green said. “So that’s a nice feeling to have. We put in the work, and now it’s time to get those matches under our belt.”
Against the Seawolves, Oosterhout earned her ninth victory of the spring as she ousted Nikolaeva 6-2, 6-2. Lee evened up her record at 4-4 with a win over Chikvashvili in the second slot, 6-2, 6-2.
Freshman Natasha Gonzalez bested Chikvashvili for her second win in the fourth position with a 6-4, 6-3 showing. Xiong beat Foo in the 5th position 6-2, 6-2, while freshman Angelina Ye earned her second win in the sixth position against Seawolf Anniki Hiel 6-1, 6-2.
Though she competed at singles against Stony Brook and Providence, Gonzalez has been successful in her short career at doubles, playing with fellow freshman Irene Lu. The duo has a record of 8-2 this season, which is the best among Harvard doubles pairings.
HARVARD, 7, PROVIDENCE, 0
In the second match against the Friars, the top two Crimson doubles pairings earned victories in straight sets without conceding a single game. In the first position, Lee and Oosterhout bested Amanda Pitocco and Aidan Epstein, 6-0. Xiong and Jasper followed up with a 6-0 defeat over Katherine DeNucci and Annie DaSilva.
Against Providence, Oosterhout beat Risa Takenaka in first position in straight sets, 6-0, 6-0. Lee took on and won the second slot against Amanda Pitocco, only dropping one game in the process, 6-1, 6-0.
“June really is a special player for us,” Green said. “When she leaves us, she’ll definitely be missed. She is very fiery and that fire typically gets others going around her. June’s a fighter and we know when she’s fighting, we have a chance, so we’re really proud of the way she’s been fighting for us and we’d really love to keep building on our doubles and single.”
Gonzalez beat the Friars’ Katie Marvin in the third position in three sets, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1. Ye bested Epstein for her third victory in the fourth position, 6-0, 6-1. Jasper outdid DeNucci in the fifth slot, 6-2, 6-4.
“We have always been pretty confident in our singles, we feel like we have a lot of depth and a lot of experience,” Green said.
Capping off Crimson’s 7-0 win was freshman Kaelli Thiel against Natalie Pitocco in the sixth position. The Piedmont, Calif. native took three sets and a tiebreaker to emerge victorious, 6-4, 4-6, 10-7.
These two wins marked Green’s 100th and 101st all-time victories, making her only the second coach in Harvard women’s tennis history to reach triple-digit wins.
“It feels great to get those victories,” Green said. “More importantly, our team won and we are progressing towards our goal, and our goal is to win the Ivy League.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the weather in southern California was uncharacteristically cool during the Harvard women’s tennis team’s trip to the region, the squad’s red-hot play made up for it. The Crimson won all three matches, each of which was played outdoor under the California sun, to push its win streak to eight.
Harvard (12-5) has just one match before Ivy League play commences on the first day of April. The Crimson took the doubles point in two of the three matches and sophomore Erica Oosterhout and Annika Ringblom, who was playing close to her home in Palos Verdes Estates, picked up three singles wins on the week.
“Our focus from the very beginning has been on improvement and to keep the big picture in mind of understanding the process and how we want to get better each week,” Harvard coach Traci Green said. “Doubles was the thorn in our side but we’re really excited how our doubles is coming along.”
HARVARD 5, UC SANTA BARBARA 2
Saturday’s match got started much like how the rest of the team’s matches have begun during the squad’s recent hot streak. Harvard got on the board to start the day, claiming the doubles point for the second time on the trip against a Gauchos team (7-8, 1-0 Big West) that the Crimson defeated last season.
With its back against the wall after captain June Lee and Oosterhout fell at the top doubles spot, the freshman duo of Natasha Gonzalez and Irene Lu answered the call by edging senior Jaimee Gilbertson and junior Natalie Da Silveira. The doubles point would come down to Ringblom and sophomore Sabrina Xiong. The decisive match lived up to the hype, as the pair edged junior Amanda Atanasson and sophomore Stephanie Yamada, 7-6.
With the all-important doubles point in hand, Harvard would go on to win four of the six singles showdowns. Senior Melissa Baker knotted the match at one after she topped Xiong, 6-4, 7-5, at the No. 6 spot. Gonzalez and Oosterhout made sure that UC Santa Barbara would never hold the lead on Saturday. Gonzalez downed fellow freshman Amit Lev-Ari in straight sets while Oosterhout finished the trip with a perfect singles slate following her 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 victory over junior Palina Dubavets at the top singles spot.
Ringblom clinched the win for the Crimson as her 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 win over Da Silveira lifted Harvard to its eighth consecutive win and capped off a perfect road trip. Atanasson edged Lu while Lee topped Gilbertson at the No. 2 spot.
“We won a tough, knock-down, drag-out match against a very strong UC Santa Barbara squad,” Green said. “Every match was tightly contested and could have gone either way. It’s nice to see the team coming together and it’s also nice to see the improvement amongst our team and how everyone’s stepping up very nicely.”
HARVARD 4, CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 0
After making quick work of Texas State earlier in the day, the Crimson made a concerted effort to outdo itself and was able to win all four of its matchups with Cal State Northridge (6-6, 2-2 Big West). Oosterhout and Lee won at the top doubles spot while Gonzalez and Lu followed suit. Already trailing 1-0, Cal State Northridge did not stand a chance in singles play.
“I think we’ve been building our confidence off of each match,” Lee said. “We started the season off a little rough...we weren’t winning the doubles point. After each match, we’re realizing that we’re right there [with top teams]. When we start winning matches and winning the doubles point, we’re starting to gain confidence and believing that we are just as good as these teams.”
Oosterhout, Lee, and Ringblom were the first three Harvard players to complete their singles matches to secure the Crimson victory. The trio was remarkably efficient, combining to win 36 of their 44 games. Ringblom was the most dominant, blowing the doors off senior Vivian Lin, 6-1, 6-0, at the fifth singles spot.
Oosterhout also had a shutout in one of her sets, topping senior Mickey Hsu, 6-4, 6-0, at No. 1. Lee bested sophomore Skyla Alcon, 6-2, 6-1.
HARVARD 4, TEXAS STATE 1
Oosterhout, Lee, and Ringblom were dominant at the top three spots against the Bobcats (4-8). All three matches went just two sets. Oosterhout began her birthday eve by topping senior Pippa Carr, 6-2, 6-1. Ringblom was similarly efficient, needing just 15 games to beat sophomore Julia Navajo-Melendez. Lee edged her two younger teammates while playing at the second singles spot. The West Windsor, N.J. native made quick work of sophomore Ana Perez in dominating fashion, 6-1, 6-1.
Sophomore Isabel Jasper appeared in her lone match of the trip on Wednesday, teaming up with Gonzalez in doubles action. The duo was unable to get past the Texas State duo of Eva Dench and Alex Jones in what was the only blemish on the day for Harvard.
“We’re just trusting what we’ve been doing in practice more and the way it comes down to those big tiebreak matches,” Lee said. “I don’t think we’re panicking like we used to. We’re treating each match as if it were an Ivy match because we know it’s prepping us for Ivies so I think that mentality is also helping us.”
