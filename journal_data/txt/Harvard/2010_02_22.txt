After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
There’s no need to shed tears over the closure of the independent Office of International Programs. After eight years of operating separately, the OIP and the Office of Career Services recently merged into the Office of Career, Research, and International Opportunities, to be headed by the interim director of OCS, Robin Mount. The move signifies a vote of confidence for the now self-evident merits of experiences abroad during a student’s college years. As such, the merger was an overall good decision that will hopefully continue to make the option of going abroad more appealing for undergraduates.
The OIP and OCS’s recombination will streamline the overlapping bureaucracy that used to exist. As of now, although study abroad and select summer programs were facilitated through the OIP, some international experience resources—such as international internships and grants that qualify as “fellowships”—were managed by OCS. (OCS even included an option to search “ignore national jobs” in its Crimson Careers internships database.) This created an unnecessarily complicated search and application process for overseas-bound students. Students interested in diverse sources for funding or work often had to duplicate paperwork for each office.
In addition to being a logistical improvement, the merger could also be helpful for students who know they want to go abroad, but are unsure whether they wish to study or work. With only one office to consult to resolve this issue, such students will be able to compare their options side-by-side and receive holistic recommendations from staff members.
However, students, staff, and faculty should still acknowledge that students’ desire to study abroad need not line up with their career interests or plans for the future. Students often go to OCS with a narrow conception of the results—the job—they want, and approaching international experiences with this fixed attitude would be a mistake. Much of the value of studying abroad is that it introduces students to new life perspectives and opportunities; viewing the time strictly as a step toward a particular profession may, in fact, detract from the experience.
The new OCRIO must ensure that it continues to offer the quality and breadth of international experiences previously available through the OIP. It would be counterproductive not to do so, as the excellence of the international programs under recent management is a significant reason why this merger was able to happen—the number of students going abroad has skyrocketed due to the extraordinary nature of many international opportunities available for Harvard students.
We are happy to see that the virtues of going abroad are now so commonly understood that the option does not need its own administrative advocate. The Harvard experience need not be confined to the Cambridge campus, and the creation of the OCRIO is yet another welcome acknowledgement of this notion.

Name, hometown, dorm, concentration. In the nascence of college life, these four talking points guide many a friendless freshman through awkward encounters with other equally lonely first-years. The four-question introduction sees its heyday during pre-orientation, when wide-eyed Harvard newcomers, equipped with campus maps and crimson lanyards, use the icebreaker with as many classmates as humanly possible. Sometime during the semester, however, this practice of shameless self-introduction and curious inquiry ceases. It is nonsensical for us to terminate generic introductions so soon, which means it is time for the four-point introduction to make a comeback on campus.
This impersonal introduction has several key advantages that must be explored. Having similar academic interests, living in the same dorm, or hailing from the same geographical region all provide the foundations for a budding friendship. Fledgling amity is almost always in desperate need of commonalities around which conversation can be sustained. A shared interest in “folk and myth” or “that new major…you know, the stem cell one” can lead to a prolonged discussion of class selection and Q ratings. Residence in the same dorm can spark listing everyone else that lives in the building, in hopes that a mutual friend can be identified. Better yet, discovery of a friend from one’s own stomping ground lends itself to reminiscing over the best local eateries.
The four-point introduction covers all the bases for potential shared interests in fewer than 20 seconds. No other icebreaker is nearly as efficient. By hitting all of the main talking points in such rapid succession, the awkward time when neither person has little to say is mitigated. Before long, both people know enough about the other person to produce makeshift conversation, which can lead to anything from mere acquaintance to best friend status.
In addition to its speed, the formulaic nature of this particular greeting is so widely acknowledged that people quickly grow accustomed to it. This makes meeting new people not only easier and faster, but also less intimidating for those who are shyer. For those who find socializing fairly difficult, the application of the four-point method can smooth any encounter by providing conversation when none exists otherwise. Through speed, predictability, and impersonality, this brief verbal questionnaire can facilitate the extroversion of the meeker among us.
This basic conversation starter also serves to ease the formation of cross-clique friendships. Whether we admit it or not, it cannot be denied that social bubbles develop quickly. These groups can be based upon anything from a sports team to an entryway. Such bubbles may inadvertently intimidate others who fall outside the circle. In this instance, the four-point introduction can be key to fostering friendships between cliques because it is, by its nature, so general that relationships can be built between almost any set of people. In that sense, this particular greeting deserves a comeback to ensure the fluidity of relations on campus. Insulation in one particular bubble is not conducive to the establishment of a welcoming social life on campus, and so the four-point introduction is needed to facilitate more diverse friendships.
The four-point introduction plays a pivotal role in the expansion of Harvard students’ horizons. Though some may criticize this technique as vapid and impersonal, the bottom line is that these two aspects of the introduction may be the keys to its success. It is the generic nature of this greeting that helps build new friendships—relationships that may grow into lifelong companionships.

The budget for the 2011 fiscal year that President Obama unveiled Feb. 1 lays out a depressing picture of this country’s future. Deficits will rise to a long-term level at which they will cease to be sustainable, and unemployment will stay high for many years. Our country is on pace to follow Japan down a path of aging and debt-ridden decay, and there seem to be few good solutions on the horizon.  The conventional wisdom says that after years of spending without any awareness of our limits, we must now enter an extended period of frugality. Yet, in reality, these desperate times call for greater spending, as opposed to cutbacks. In order to reduce the sky-high unemployment that threatens our country’s present and future, to soothe the damaged and frightened national psyche, and to build a strong foundation for growth, the government must unleash massive public spending.
In the last report, unemployment stood at 9.7 percent, and it looks to remain at that level for a long time. The recently released budget outlines a $100 billion jobs program and a $30 billion program to help community banks make loans, but the administration itself projects that these will only put a small dent in unemployment, which will remain at levels over or near 8 percent through 2012.
Sustained unemployment over 8 percent, however, is more than just a horrible number; it represents millions of families who put less food on the table, who have to choose between taking care of aging parents and sending children to good schools and colleges, and who suffer from the devastating social effects of joblessness. Many economists point to high deficits and returning growth, and argue that America must make the difficult choice to curb spending, even if unemployment will remain high. But if unemployment stays high for an extended period, we might lose an entire generation of children who could have grown up healthy and well educated if only their parents had jobs.
Not only does high unemployment severely hurt our country’s future, but it also hinders our ability to recover from the current crisis due to its effect on the national psyche. As renowned behavioral economist Robert Shiller clearly articulated in a recent New York Times article, for a country to truly recover from an economic crisis, workers must be personally invested in the country’s economy, confident enough to take out loans, and willing to take risks to fuel growth. Right now, the entire country is frozen in economic fear, paralyzed by the shattering depth of the economic crisis and concerned that recovery is too far in the future. In such an environment, it will be extremely difficult for our economy to become as strong as it was during the boom years of the ’90s.
In such times, the major solution is government spending. This is not a solution borne of socialist tendencies or a belief in government as the most efficient allocator of capital but, rather, the clear realization that the government can employ people quickly and effectively. The first step must be for the government to extend aid to states in order to save the jobs of teachers, civil servants, and local employees such as firefighters and policemen. Such aid was extended in Obama’s stimulus bill and helped save a great deal of jobs, but with almost every state running deficits and with a few even approaching bankruptcy, states would be forced to make difficult decisions if this aid were to run out. In addition to this, therefore, the government must build on the efforts of the stimulus and spend far more than $100 billion on infrastructure, clean-energy and other important projects that will create jobs. While tax cuts are often merely saved or used to pay down personal debt, spending on projects that have to create jobs comes with a guarantee of expanding employment.
Furthermore, the spending must be high enough to return the economy to normal employment in the foreseeable future, because this is the only solution to avert the generational and psychological catastrophe that will come with high unemployment. However, the necessity of such spending proposals does not allow us to ignore our deficit. Our excessive borrowing is a serious, long-term problem and should be dealt with by focusing on the skyrocketing costs of Medicare and Social Security instead of curbing domestic outlays that are necessary for economic recovery. But any fiscal reforms will be useless if they are implemented in a country that is permanently weakened by the loss of an entire generation destroyed by the specter of unemployment. In the short term, the government must spend aggressively to make sure that millions are not left without jobs, education, and futures. It has no choice but to spend more, because, unfortunately, the costs of inaction are far too large.

What’s the Buzz? Google’s newest product, an in-your-face status broadcasting service built onto Gmail that acts like a hybrid of Facebook and Twitter, was launched the day it was announced two weeks ago. The initial reaction, at least at Harvard, has been polarizing. Many students struggled with exactly what Buzz is and how it’s supposed to be used. Is it a way to transmit status updates? Share photos? Meet new people? As a fellow Crimson writer described it, “I don’t know what it is, but I hate it.”
Google remains the best search engine in the world, has one of the most fully-featured free email services around, and keeps yuppies from getting lost in big cities. But social networking may be its Achilles heel. Its version of MySpace, called Orkut, has made inroads in Brazil and India, but lags far behind in the rest of the world. Buzz may someday succeed at supplanting other, more popular social networks, but the product’s abrupt launch has generated serious privacy concerns.
Rather than let users choose their “followers,” the Buzz term for other users who are privy to personal updates, photos, and videos, Google automatically selected a group of followers based on frequent email contacts. Since lists of followers were publicly available, Buzz’s launch shone the cruel light of day onto email relationships better kept secret. Suddenly, journalists’ clandestine contacts were exposed, secret affairs became dramatically less secret, and stalkers obtained a new tool to harass their victims. Oops.
Privacy watchdogs are downright furious, and Google is already reeling from several legal complaints about the auto-following feature of Google Buzz. To its credit, Google responded to the complaints and bad press quickly. It posted an apology on its blog a few days after the launch and quickly reconfigured Buzz so that it would simply suggest followers, instead of making email contacts into followers automatically. It will also no longer automatically broadcast Picasa photos and Google Reader shared items over Buzz. Perhaps the biggest sign of backpedaling is the creation of a prominent button that allows users to disable Buzz entirely.
Can Google’s quick actions save Buzz from a messy launch? Or is Buzz, like the Wave before it, another reflection of Google’s immaturity—its uncanny ability to understand data but its utter hopelessness at understanding people?
The company, founded in 1998, has always been a haven for engineers, who get paid to work on independent projects of their choosing one day each week. While letting the inmates run the asylum has served Google well in the past—side projects have led to about half of the company’s product launches—the decision to include auto-following by default seems like a clear case of engineering enthusiasm trumping common sense.
In its struggle against Facebook, Google must have realized that it already had the necessary information to create a powerful social network. FAS webmail might be fleeting, but Gmails are forever, and a trail of emails going back several years on Google’s servers could create a far richer web of connections than Facebook. However, while Google engineers see emails as raw data, users view their email as private correspondence. Reaching into the personal histories of its users to compile a list of contacts, one that was not only unsolicited but freely accessible, was a major party foul.
Even regarding data that was already publicly available, the Buzz team seemed unable to grasp the concept of user discretion. Google assumed that just because photos were already public on Picasa, users would be perfectly happy to see them broadcast on every channel to contacts that Google had picked out for them.
To be fair, Google is struggling with a novel, asymmetric situation between producers and consumers on the Internet today. Many of the most successful online products, from Gmail to Facebook, are completely free. Yet customers who use these free services nonetheless feel an intense degree of ownership over them, because they traffic in deeply personal data such as emails and photos. Developers have the right to drop new, unsolicited features on their users at any time, even without warning, yet users feel entitled to certain rights of their own—most pressingly, the right to privacy.
If providers of web services are unable to understand the privacy needs of their users, perhaps it is time for the government to enter the fray. When online services such as Gmail are free to change their behavior willy-nilly without so much as a warning, simply educating users about the lack of privacy isn’t enough. We need rules that limit what corporations are allowed to do with our personal data, even when that data is given over willingly to their care.
Regulations are in a company like Google’s own best interest. If this kind of abuse continues, users will do what they would do to any former confidant who started blabbing all of their secrets at a party—defriend them in the morning.

“What is life? / Ask Andrew Berry / why we can’t marry / a spore.”
So sang Marina S. Magloire ’11 and Kelly N. Bodwin ’11 to the tune of Haddaway’s “What Is Love,” at the inaugural Science of the Physical Universe 20 project exhibition in the General Education office Friday afternoon.
The exhibit featured student projects that blended art and science, ranging from musicals about mitosis to 3-D models of the tree of life.
“We wanted a capstone project in addition to the final exam,” said organismic and evolutionary biology lecturer Andrew Berry, who is one of the course’s three instructors. “We thought students should have the opportunity to engage with the material in any way they wanted to.”
Physics professor Melissa Franklin—another SPU 20 professor, who had to miss the exhibit because she is in Geneva working on the Large Hadron Collider—first suggested giving students the option of creating an original project rather than writing a final paper.
“I was dubious, but lots of people took this idea and ran with it,” Berry said. “I’ve really been blown away by the quality and diversity of the stuff people have produced here.”
Two SPU 20 students, Veronica E. Manzo ’13 and Daniel R. Martin ’13, filmed a 16-minute movie involving a runaway princess set in the “Hardy-Weinberg Kingdom,” inspired by the Hardy-Weinberg principle which explains what causes allele and genotype frequencies to change over time in a population.
Anna J. Murphy ’12 chose to explore thermodynamic entropy—or degree of disorder—from the perspective of an alien in a short movie, and Katherine A. Mills ’11 investigated the same concept through a set of two paintings entitled “Colorful Dots.”
Poems, a model of the Big Bang, essays, and a film entitled “Pride and Prejudice and Electrons,” by Cora F. Frazier ’11 were also on display at the exhibition.
The third SPU 20 instructor Logan S. McCarty ’96 noted that the interdisciplinary course—which spans chemistry, physics, and biology—was possible as a result of the flexibility of the General Education curriculum.
“This event is General Education personified,” said General Education administrative director Stephanie H. Kenen, as she observed the project displays. “We want Gen Ed to be a place where students can extend their intellectual lives outside of the classroom.”
SPU 20, which attracted about 130 students last semester, satisfies the Science A or B credit under the Core curriculum in addition to the Science of the Physical Universe or Science of Living Systems credit under General Education.
McCarty, who is also Assistant Dean of the College, said the three instructors plan to incorporate some of the projects into next year’s curriculum as teaching tools and hope to create an online gallery where the projects can be viewed.
“Having all these projects will inspire students and show them the breadth of what they can consider,” he said. “Over time we hope to develop an incredible repertoire.”

A recent report by the Congressional Oversight Panel chaired by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren predicts a wave of commercial real estate loan failures that could jeopardize the stability of many banks, particularly mid-size and smaller banks.
The report, published on Feb. 10, cautions that even borrowers who own profitable properties may be unable to refinance their loans as they face tightened underwriting standards, increased demands for additional investment by borrowers, and restricted credit.
“Over the next four years, a wave of commercial real estate loan failures will add to the pressures on the struggling American economy,” said panel spokesman Peter Jackson. “$1.4 trillion in loans will come up for refinancing between 2011 and 2014.”
Nearly half of commerical real estate loans are currently “underwater,” meaning that the borrower owes more than what the property is worth.
Unlike the current housing crisis, the report indicated that smaller community banks face a greater risk than large Wall Street banks.
“[The crisis] has the potential to jeopardize small businesses,” Jackson said. “Community banks stand to suffer the most and they are the primary lenders to small businesses.”
Jackson added that a wave of community bank failures may “prolong the already painful recession.”
Associate Vice President of Harvard Real Estate Services James W. Gray said that while he agrees commercial real estate markets are stressed, the situation is less dire in Cambridge.
“The Harvard Square market and the Cambridge market are a little bit insulated by the University’s presence, so I don’t foresee it being as much of a problem there,” Gray said. “Harvard owns a great many commercial properties, but I don’t think this problem is going to have much of an effect on Harvard’s holdings because they are long-term and not heavily leveraged.”
Noting that “there are a lot of different tools in the toolbox when it comes to strategies for the threat posed by commercial real estate to the financial industry,” Jackson said the report does not recommend one specific course of action.
“The panel was clear that when it comes to the idea of injecting more capital into financial institutions,” Jackson said. “There are investors that made some bad bets in commercial real estate and everyone doesn’t deserve new funding.”

The Undergraduate Council passed legislation last night allocating $600 to hire a web developer to create an online study guide library, pending approval of Harvard administrators.
Student representatives voiced concerns about the ethical implications of creating and advocating a study guide library for the entire undergraduate community as well as the potential response of professors and deans to the initiative, and the UC subsequently passed two amendments to address these issues.
The first amendment clarified that this legislation did not yet endorse the library’s launch but instead permitted the disbursement of funds for development of the site. A later vote will be taken to authorize the site’s implementation.
The second amendment stipulated that the money will not be spent until UC President Johnny F. Bowman ’11  and Vice President Eric N. Hysen ’11 gain approval from College deans for the project.
Though the amended resolution passed with 23 votes in favor and 6 opposed, students questioned the merits of the study guide library project.
“We haven’t thought about this enough—there are so many questions here,” said Harry T. Rimalower ’10, an Adams House representative. “It really does skirt academic integrity. Yes, lots of people have access to these study guides, but that doesn’t make it right.”
But Hysen maintained the idea will be popular and beneficial to students.
“Johnny and I knocked on hundreds of doors during the campaign and told this idea to every single person,” Hysen said. “I didn’t hear a single person say, ‘I don’t want a study guide library.’”
In addition to discussing the study guide library, the UC approved plans to circulate a preliminary report to administrators detailing the effects of cuts to hot breakfast on upperclassmen.
The report—which consolidates the responses of 769 students from the UC’s campus-wide survey—will guide discussions at the next Committee on Student Life meeting on March 4, Hysen said.
According to the survey findings, the budget cuts have negatively impacted the wellbeing of a significant number of students, leaving them with nutritionally deficient breakfast options.
In particular, insufficient protein sources have disproportionately affected athletes and those with unique dietary needs, such as vegetarians, diabetics, and lactose-intolerant students.
In response to these concerns, the UC report proposed several “approximately budget neutral suggestions” such as serving hot eggs, installing omelet makers, and serving hot breakfast on a weekday instead of Saturdays.
The report also proposed closing two of the quad houses at lunch in exchange for offering hot breakfast at one river house and one quad house each day.
Student Life Committee Chair Senan Ebrahim ’12 stressed these are only “floating” ideas and that the student body and labor representatives will be polled to formalize proposals.
“This is by no means our final recommendation on what [the UC] will do but we’ve never even had the opportunity to sit down and talk with the administration directly on this issue,” Senan said in an interview yesterday. “Just to get that voice on their desk, in their face—this legislation represents that phase.”

Kirkland House will no longer be using overflow housing at 20 DeWolfe Street next year, according to several resident tutors and students.
“As far as I know, that is the case,” said Daniel T. Larson ’98, a Kirkland tutor who lives in DeWolfe housing, in response to whether House residents will be occupying 20 DeWolfe Street.
Resident tutors John D. Cella ’08 and Patricia Hernandez ’04 confirmed that Kirkland had decided to cease housing students in DeWolfe.
Kirkland residents currently occupy the third and fourth floors of the building and share DeWolfe housing with students from Leverett and Quincy Houses located across the street. Kirkland, though, is located at the other end of Mill Street.
Kirkland House Committee members have long supported the idea of ending housing at DeWolfe, as it is often difficult for Dewolfe residents to feel part of the House community.
“Kirkland prides itself on being a tight-knit community, and DeWolfe housing has always been the one roadblock we faced,” said former HoCo chair William M. K. Stallings ’10.
Kelly N. Bodwin ’11, a current HoCo co-chair, said she personally agreed with the idea of not using DeWolfe to house Kirkland residents, though she said she has only heard rumors from tutors about ending DeWolfe housing.
What complicated efforts to end Kirkland overflow housing in DeWolfe in the past was the allocation of funds to the Houses, according to Stallings. Stallings said that a reduction in the number of residents could spell a similar reduction in funds—a problem that Kirkland already faces as one of the smaller Houses.
It is unclear whether discontinuing the use of DeWolfe overflow housing would affect the budget for Kirkland activities or the jobs of the resident tutors currently living there. House Masters Tom C. and Verena A. Conley could not be reached for comment for this article.
Several Kirkland students who live in DeWolfe said that eliminating housing there would have a positive impact on House community.
“We don’t really make it to House Master events that are offered because we’re not in the House,” said Bjorn A. Whitmore ’12, whose blocking group did not request DeWolfe but has enjoyed the building’s amenities, including cable service and in-suite kitchens.
Michael Zheng ’12, another Kirkland student in DeWolfe, said that while it would be “unfortunate” that fewer rooms would be available to rising sophomores, ending DeWolfe housing “will be good for the House.”
Quincy House Master Lee Gehrke wrote in an e-mail that he is not aware of plans to expand Quincy housing into the two floors of the building. Leverett House will not be expanding into DeWolfe either, according to an e-mail sent by Leverett House Master Howard Georgi ’68.

Harvard Law School student Eva S. Hibnick filed a class action lawsuit on Wednesday against Google on behalf of Gmail users, alleging that Google Buzz—Google’s new social networking application—discloses personal information without consent and constitutes a breach of privacy.
Buzz allows users to “follow,” or track updates posted by, their e-mail contacts. Though Google has issued apologies and made changes to the program since its Feb. 9 launch, the application continues to be an “opt-out” program, meaning that Gmail’s 31.2 million users are automatically signed up until they choose to deactivate Buzz.
Hibnick, a second year student at the Law School, said she was upset that she was automatically “following” and being “followed” on Buzz by people whom Google had chosen for her.
“The social networking industry is going too far,” Hibnick said.
Hibnick signed on as lead plaintiff for the lawsuit after third year Law School student Benjamin R. Osborn approached her about pursuing a class action suit.
Osborn said he thought that there might be evidence for a lawsuit two days after the program launched and later suggested the idea to Law School professor William B. Rubenstein, who specializes in class action law.
Rubenstein then contacted attorney Gary E. Mason, who will now take charge of the case, with Rubenstein and Osborn serving as independent consultants.
Rubenstein said he regularly works with students on litigation, but said that this was the first time a student came to him with an idea for a lawsuit.
“[Osborn’s] identification of this as an issue reflects the fact that these social networking sites are a concern of the student generation,” Rubenstein said. “The most important thing about this case to me is the initiative my students have shown.”
According to Osborn, it is unclear whether Google’s breach of privacy was intentional.
“I don’t know what Google’s motive is in all of this,” Osborn said. “I think they were just trying to jump-start their social network.”
Whether Google was aware of the problem could determine the outcome of the case, according to Rubenstein. If Google had known that the application infringed upon users’ privacy, the corporation could face greater consequences, he said.
Rubenstein also noted the lack of transparency about the changes that Google has made to Buzz in the last few weeks, and Osborn said that the team plans to pursue the case regardless of any future modifications to the application.
“[Buzz] has already violated people’s privacy,” Osborn said. “Damages have been incurred. And we want Google to change its conduct in the future.”
Historically similar cases have settled rather than gone to trial, Mason said. He suggested that monetary compensation might go to an appropriate public interest group or organization, rather than being distributed among all of Gmail’s users, but declined to estimate the amount of compensation sought by the plaintiffs.
Google has not made any public comments in response to the lawsuit and did not return requests for comment this weekend.

“All are welcome. We are not fancy. We especially welcome sinners,” proclaims the Web site of St. Martha’s Episcopal Church in Lexington, Ky., where the Reverend Timothy R. Fleck ’86 was made Clergy-in-Charge this past December.
While homosexuality is not considered a sin in the Episcopal Church, which is known for being more progressive than other denominations, Fleck said that he had his doubts about living with another man in an openly gay relationship when he was first invited to Kentucky.
“I had in my mind prejudiced ideas about eastern Kentucky and Appalachia, and I wasn’t sure my partner and I would be comfortable or even safe,” he said. “But I’ve found that the parish at St. Martha’s has been very friendly and accepting.”
Fleck said that he was looking for spiritual direction throughout his time at the College and joined the Episcopal Church after graduating. He came out during his senior year, though only to a handful of close friends.
“It’s amazing to me now to look back 25 years and know how difficult a thing it was to think about being out and just how terrifying it was,” he said.
Although the Episcopal Church ordained its first openly gay priest in New Jersey in 1989, many other denominations do not embrace gay ministers.
“Homosexuality is not an acceptable practice according to the Bible, especially for someone in ministry,” said William D. Henard, senior pastor at Porter Memorial Baptist Church in Lexington. “It’s no different from adultery, stealing, or any other behavior that is against scripture.”
Henard said he does not think people are born homosexual, but that it is a lifestyle choice.
Bill W. Chandler, the office administrator at Lexington’s Gay and Lesbian Services Organization, disagrees.
“You become aware of your sexuality, but no one can choose the way they are,” he said.
Chandler said he believes developments like Fleck’s ordination are a move in the right direction in the quest to end LGBT discrimination.
“People can postpone the changes but they can’t stop them,” he said. “I think being openly gay in any profession can’t do anything but good.”
Kentucky native Michelle E. Crentsil ’10 also spoke about visibility as an important aspect of moving toward a more accepting community.
“I think religion is an overriding influence in Kentucky and having someone in an ordained position as someone the LGBT community can identify with is a huge step forward,” she said.
Fleck said that he has been pleasantly surprised by the reception he has encountered in Kentucky.
“I’ve been remarkably impressed by how welcoming the whole community has been.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Senior Advisor to the President Valerie B. Jarrett highlighted the role of personal relationships in the political sphere, speaking about her friendship with President Barack Obama to several hundred audience members at the Institute of Politics on Friday.
The event, co-sponsored by the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, featured a conversation between Jarrett and Kennedy School professor David R. Gergen.
Jarrett recounted her first interactions with the Obamas, when she interviewed Michelle Obama for a job with Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley in 1991. Her decades-long relationship with Obama has strengthened her ability to advise the President, Jarrett said, as she understands the important elements of his character, including an “even-keeled temperament” and “a sense of empathy.”
Gergen called Jarrett “the nation’s First Friend” and said he felt comfortable knowing that Jarrett’s friendship with Obama allowed her to be an honest advisor to the President.
“Politics is a mixture of policy and personality,” Gergen said in an interview after the event. “If you don’t get the personal angle, you don’t understand what’s really happening.”
Jarrett also addressed recent public concerns about the Obama administration’s stance on issues such as the economy, government spending, and health care reform. She emphasized that the public must acknowledge the difficulty of and time needed for meaningful changes, but also said that the administration plans to incorporate ideas of ordinary Americans into government policy.
“Part of what was so magical about the president’s campaign was that he was able to get so many people interested in government who had been so apathetic for so long,” Jarrett said. “Part of what is frustrating for us is to see the tenor of the dialogue degenerate so much that people who were captivated are apathetic.”
Several audience members said they enjoyed hearing the insight Jarrett gave into Obama’s thought process.
“People generally feel that the White House and Oval office are closed off, but we really got to see a close and intimate glimpse,” Alice Xiang ’13 said.
Harvard Divinity School student Jaeson D. Plon said he was better able to appreciate Obama’s decision-making by listening to a firsthand account describing the president in more familiar terms.
“It definitely puts one at ease, getting a sense of the personality,” Plon said. “The people who hold these offices are people, and they need support of friends.”
But Kennedy School student Anirudh Suri said he was skeptical whether personal friendships should play such an important role in government.
“It made me wonder what that means for inclusivity in politics, what that means for people who are not in these circles,” Suri said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Daniel J. Weinstein ’03-’04 skated his way into college.
Before arriving at his Holworthy dorm room, Weinistein was a U.S. national speed-skating champion who competed in the short track speed skating portion of the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
By the end of his senior year, Weinstein had competed in the Olympics for the second time, this time in Salt Lake City, Utah.
At age 16, Weinstein was the youngest skater to place in the Olympics. When he returned to the Olympics in 2002, he placed fourth in the short track speed-skating competition.
“It was cool having tens of thousands of people cheering for me,” Weinstein said of the experience.
Raised in Brookline, Mass., Weinstein remembers being “star-struck” by talented Olympians as well as Wayne Gretzky, a former National Hockey League player, whom he saw sitting at a table near him.
Although he moved to Colorado his junior year of high school to train exclusively for the Olympics, Weinstein said he soon realized that he was not skating to his high standards, which he said was one of the reasons he chose to attend Harvard.
According to a March 2, 2000 Crimson article, Weinstein maintained a rigorous workout schedule while in college—waking up at 5:30 a.m. twice a week to go to Walpole, Mass. for skating practice and weight-training every day.
Despite this demanding schedule, Weinstein said that, “Harvard “allowed me to not make skating my life.”
Eliot R. Hamlisch ’04 remembers his college friend as a “very social guy at school [who] also stayed in close touch with friends, family and skating teammates.”
Howard Georgi ’68, Leverett House Master and physics professor, described the former Leverett resident as an “overwhelmingly nice guy” who did well in school and was modest about his Olympian status.
“Probably many students didn’t even know that he was an Olympian,” Georgi said.
Although Weinstein retired from speed-skating in 2002, he said he continues to watch the Olympics.
“I love watching it,” said Weinstein, adding, “speed skaters are bringing in most of the medals.”
After graduating from Harvard in 2004 with a degree in psychology, Weinstein received an MBA from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
He is now a senior consultant at Vermont-based Resource Systems Group, a market research and consulting firm.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Angela M. Ruggiero ’02-’04 has medalled in three previous Winter Olympics, worked in commercial real estate, written an autobiography, been fired by Donald Trump on the television show “The Apprentice,” and later turned down a subsequent job offer from Trump.
Now Ruggiero—the youngest player to make the U.S. National Ice Hockey Team at 15—once again joins her teammates in Vancouver for her fourth Olympics, playing defense on the American women’s ice hockey team.
The Los Angeles native had already won a gold medal at the 1998 Olympics when she came to play hockey for Harvard.
During her undergraduate career, Ruggiero constantly impressed her teammates, and her coach Katey Stone recalled that Ruggiero had the “total package.”
“She has the speed of a smaller player” said Brian Schulz ’01, a broadcaster for U.S. College Hockey Online who first saw Ruggiero play during her freshman year.
Former teammate Angela Franciso Flygh ’01 remembers Ruggiero’s extreme strength, stating that Ruggiero once hit the puck at practice so hard that it broke part of Flygh’s skate.
“The toe part is very sturdy,” Flygh said of the skate.
Although she was always serious during practices and games, Flygh said Ruggiero was “a complete goofball” who was fond of playing pranks off the ice.
Ruggiero was named NCAA First Team Academic All-American in 2004 and graduated cum laude in government. The Hockey News also voted her best Female Hockey Player in the World in 2003.
Ruggiero won a silver medal at the 2002 Olympics and brought home the bronze from Torino in 2006.
Today, Ruggiero and two of her fellow Harvard alumni are competing in the semi-final game against Sweden. In the other women’s semi-final, two Harvard graduates will represent Canada in a game against Finland, leaving open the possibility that all five Harvard graduates will compete for the gold on Thursday.

It wasn’t always obvious that Caitlin K. Cahow ’07-’08 would go to the Olympics. But she’s competing in her second Olympic games in Vancouver, playing defense for the American women’s ice hockey team after taking home the bronze in Torino four years ago.
“Caitlin is an interesting story,” said Brian Schulz ’01, a broadcaster for U.S. College Hockey Online. “She started as a forward [at Harvard] and struggled.”
Halfway through her freshman season in 2003, Harvard Women’s ice hockey head coach Katey Stone switched Cahow to defense, where she “developed into a tremendous athlete and hockey player,” Stone said.
Her sophomore year, Cahow had a “breakout season” and “got on the radar for the national team,” Schulz said.
By 2005, Cahow was ranked third in the nation for defensive scoring, and that same year, she won Harvard’s Joe Bertagna Award for Most Improved Player and was named to the all-tournament team at the NCAA Frozen Four.
Former teammate M. Nicole Corriero ’05 praised Cahow’s “deceptive speed,” and Harvard athletics spokesman Timothy J. Williamson pointed to her demonstrated power on the ice.
She has an “unbelievable” personality, Corriero said, adding that the team immediately took to Cahow during the recruit trip.
“She was so easy going, so easy to get along with, and up for anything,” Corriero said, recalling that Cahow could often be seen watching a friend’s game or going to an a cappella concert.
The daughter of a figure skater-turned-endocrinologist, Cahow played hockey while attending boarding school at The Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn.
In addition to playing hockey, Cahow played lacrosse her sophomore year and graduated with a degree in social and biological anthropology after taking time off to train for the 2006 Olympics.
Cahow plans to attend law school in September.

Now competing in her fourth Olympic Winter Games at the age of 30, Jennifer L. Botterill ’02-’03 will forever be a legend of the women’s ice hockey program at Harvard—although her chance at a fourth medal is only one among many impressive career accomplishments.
This year’s Winter Games have special meaning for Botterill as they take place in her home country of Canada. Though winning three Olympic medals would be any athlete’s dream, representing one’s country on home turf is particularly significant—and so far the extra pressure has paid off, with the Canadian women’s hockey team winning three decisive victories against Slovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden this past week.
“The crowds have been absolutely amazing,” said Botterill, speaking from Vancouver on Saturday. “We really feel the energy of all the people that are here to support us.”
Though she already had an Olympic silver medal to her name before coming to Harvard, Botterill—nicknamed “Botts” by friends and teammates—was never one to rest on her laurels, and her unrivalled collegiate record is a testament to her drive, according to her coaches.
“So much of her development came through her hard work and determination,” said Katey Stone, the Harvard women’s ice hockey head coach. “She really took advantage of everything Harvard had to offer and got as good as she could get.”
A native of Winnipeg, Canada, Botterill has both ice-skating and Olympics in her blood as her mother competed in two Winter Games as a speed skater.
A member of the Canadian national women’s ice hockey team since 1997, Botterill began her Harvard career in 1998 when she helped lead the Crimson to victory in the U.S. women’s college hockey championship and was named MVP of the tournament.
In the 2000-01 season, Botterill set a U.S. college hockey record by scoring in 80 consecutive games as team captain and won the Patty Kazmaier Award for being the most outstanding player in U.S. women’s college hockey.
Botterill took time off to compete in the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City and brought home a second medal—this time gold.
Returning to Harvard for the 2002-03 academic year, she served as team captain and was the only player to win a second Patty Kazmaier Award.
“Sarah [Vaillancourt ’08-’09, Canadian teammate and Harvard graduate] and I playing here feel so proud to have played for the Crimson,” Botterill said. “Harvard gave us the skill, development, and confidence to go all the way.”
As the all-time NCAA point leader in U.S. women’s college hockey, Botterill scored at least one point in 106 of the 107 games she played for Harvard, impressing teammates, fans, opponents, and coaches alike.
“It was awesome to coach her. To be able to have that kind of talent on your ice every day is incredible,” Stone said. “Jennifer playing in her fourth Olympics is a tremendous accomplishment. She is a big park of Hockey Canada’s future and an exciting player to watch.”
Botterill and team Canada compete today in the women’s ice hockey Olympic semi-finals, facing off against Finland and shooting for their fourth victory in the 2010 Vancouver games.

After Julie Chu ’07 tried out for the 2002 Winter Olympics her senior year in high school, her father made a bet that the whole family would get tattoos if she made the U.S. Olympic women’s ice hockey team.
Chu’s family kept their promise.
The day after the national team was announced, her parents, brother, and sister each got tattoos bearing the Olympic rings and Julie’s No. 13, according to NBC’s 2010 Winter Olympics Web site.
Chu deferred her acceptance to Harvard for a year so that she could compete in the Olympics in Salt Lake City, where she took home a silver medal.
Chu, the first Asian American woman to play for the U.S. Olympic ice hockey team, is now making her third Olympic appearance in Vancouver. As forward, she has led the team through an undefeated preliminary round. The U.S. and Canadian teams are currently one victory away from facing a long-awaited battle for the gold.
“She has that intangible fire in her belly to win and an exemplary compassion,” said Katey Stone, Harvard’s head women’s ice hockey coach.
Stone, who coached Chu during her time at Harvard, described her as a “great teammate, very coachable athlete, tremendous athlete actually.”
Chu co-captained Harvard’s women’s ice hockey team as a junior, where she distinguished herself as Harvard’s all-time assists leader and set the NCAA record for career points.
She has also won the All-American title three times and the USA Hockey Foundation’s Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award.
After her junior year, Chu took a year off to compete in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Italy, where she won a bronze medal. In 2007, she graduated with honors in psychology.
Chu started to play hockey as an eight-year-old in Connecticut, after spending time as a figure skater and soccer player. She captained her high school hockey team at Choate Rosemary Hall until she was asked to join the national team as a senior.
She has said she would like to start a teaching career after hockey. Until then, it is up to Chu and her team to bring home a gold medal.

No one expected American figure skater Paul S. Wylie ’90-91 to snag a silver medal at the 1992 Olympics in Albertville, France.
Critics at the time doubted Wylie’s ability to pull off a solid performance after a string of inconsistent events leading up to the Olympics.
Wylie’s coach at the time, Mary Scotvold, credited his win to his ability to focus full time on skating after graduating from Harvard in 1991.
Scotvold recalls her time working with Wylie, who she said was always juggling schoolwork with 30 hours of training a week at the Boston Skating Rink.
“On planes, he always had his books with him,” Scotvold said. “It was a wonderful opportunity for him to go to Harvard, but it was like coaching somebody with your hands tied behind your back.”
At Harvard, the Eliot House resident designed his course load around roughly six hours of training a day, taking only two classes the semester before the 1988 Olympics and graduating with a degree in Government in five years.
Along with his rigorous training and academic schedule, Wylie helped organize “An Evening with Champions,” the annual skating benefit that raises money for cancer research.
“He was so good about being the intermediary between the Jimmy Fund and the professional world, always identifying new talent for the show,” said then-Eliot House Master Stephen A. Mitchell, a professor of Scandinavian oral tradition and literature. “He was just a very gifted member of the community who used his notoriety to the benefit of the community.”
The 1981 Junior World Champion at 16 and a member of three U.S. World teams, the Texas native attempted to keep a low profile on campus.
“Paul was a recognizable figure,” said David A. Roosevelt ’93, a close college friend at the time. “He wanted to be a normal guy and a normal student.”
After his victory in the 1992 Olympics, Wylie came back to his alma mater, and Mitchell even ordered the lighting of the Eliot House bell tower to honor the occasion.
“My wife had organized some of the students and the House staff,” Mitchell recalled. “They were all sitting in my bedroom and there were bed sheets that had been laid out, and they were painting signs: ‘You’ll always be the gold medalist for us.’”
Wylie, who could not be reached for comment, graduated from Harvard Business School in 2000 and was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2008.

Sarah Vaillancourt ’08-’09 learned how to skate at the age of two. At 12, Vaillancourt already knew she wanted to play ice hockey for her home country of Canada in the Olympics some day.
Twelve years later, she achieved her dream, taking home a gold medal in the 2006 Winter Games in Torino, Italy, and is now poised for a second victory in Vancouver.
Hockey was a natural choice for Vaillancourt. Her father and brother both play, and her early commitment to the sport paid off. By age 18, after a decorated varsity career at Pomfret Prep School, she was already wearing her own Team Canada jersey to compete in the 2003 Nations Cup.
During her first season at Harvard, she helped her team reach the Frozen Four championship, where she was picked for the All-Tournament Team, and was named Rookie of the Year in both the Ivy League and the Eastern Collegiate Athletics Conference.
After taking a year off to compete in the 2006 Winter Olympic Games, Vaillancourt returned to Harvard in 2006 and was named to the New England Division-I All-Star team by the ECAC, and to the second women’s Division-I All-American team by the American Hockey Coaches Association.
Despite her many awards and great success, those who know her say that Vaillancourt has remained grounded.
“She was always a very good teammate and a happy-go-lucky kid,” said Joakim B. Flygh, assistant women’s hockey coach at Harvard, who worked with Vaillancourt during her junior and senior years. “It is always a tremendous thing when you have kids like Sarah.  She was extremely talented, but also incredibly hard-working-a pleasure to coach.”
In the 2007-2008 season, Vaillancourt helped lead the Crimson to the NCAA Frozen Four semifinals, was named New England Women’s Hockey Player of the Year, and won the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award for the most outstanding player in women’s hockey.
Her senior year, Vaillancourt led her team to finish fourth overall in the NCAA. She was named the Ivy League and ECAC Women’s Hockey Player of the Year, and the New England Women’s Hockey Player of the Year for the second time.
At Harvard, Vaillancourt was honored with the Radcliffe Prize for the top female athlete at the Harvard Varsity Club’s Senior Letterwinners Dinner.
Though her coaches and teammates at Harvard say they miss her greatly, they are grateful for the impact she had during her collegiate career and happy to watch her continuing success.
“Sarah was a huge part of building the women’s ice hockey program at Harvard,” said women’s hockey head coach Katey Stone. “It is great to see her performing so well.”
Team Canada has been dominating the competition thus far in the Vancouver games, and a face off with the U.S. team is likely in the finals.
In that case, Vaillancourt and teammate Jennifer Botterill ’02-’03 will have to play against former Harvard teammates representing the U.S., leaving their former coaches rooting for both sides.
“I want it to be an exciting game and I’m sure it will be. It is awesome to see those two teams play-the skill level is absolutely tremendous,” Flygh said. “The Canadian and U.S. Olympic teams are an unbelievable showcase of how far women’s hockey has come.”
Vaillancourt and team Canada compete today in the women’s ice hockey Olympic semi-finals, facing off against Finland and shooting for their fourth victory in the 2010 Vancouver games.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For most athletes, the opportunity to compete in the Olympic Games is the crowning moment of their careers—the stuff of dreams for trainees who spend years toiling on the rinks or fields.
Lifelong figure skater Emily A. Hughes ’11 was no exception: “I don’t think I was really thinking, ‘Oh, I’m going to go to the Olympics,’” she says of her time skating in middle and high school. “It was more of a, ‘Oh, I dream to go to the Olympics’—and then when it actually happened, it was just amazing.”
In 2006, Hughes was called to Torino, Italy to compete in the Winter Olympics, where she placed seventh overall. Hughes—then a junior in high school—had previously been named as an alternate for the event after winning the bronze medal at the 2006 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.
With several national championship performances and an Olympic appearance under her belt—not to mention the co-authorship of “I Am a Skater”—Hughes by no means resembles the typical Harvard undergraduate. But for all her athletic accomplishments, she says that skating has not compromised her devotion to education—a decision that she made at an early age.
“I didn’t want to take time off of high school or college just to skate,” says Hughes, now a junior at Harvard. “Having that balance, I think, made skating better for me and made school better for me, because it wasn’t just all skating or all school.”
ROAD TO 2010
Despite her desire to strike the perfect balance between school and skating, Hughes decided to take a leave of absence from Harvard last semester to train to qualify for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She knew she needed to dedicate more time to skating to compete at the Olympic level again, Hughes says.
“I either had to take some time off of school and compete, or not compete and go to school,” she says. “I think that was one of the first times that it was either-or.”
Indeed, prior to her decision to leave Harvard, Hughes had made consistent efforts to perform  her duties as a student and an athlete without sacrificing either—a balancing act that most Olympic-level skaters do not even attempt, she says.
“I think that a lot of people questioned it, but I never did,” Hughes says. “I’ve always seen myself going to college, so that was never an option. Harvard is just a great place, so trying to balance the two made sense to me.”
During her freshman and sophomore years, Hughes scheduled her classes in the morning or afternoon to make time for training sessions at a rink in Acton, Mass. and the Skating Club of Boston. Hughes skated a few hours each day, worked regularly with a trainer, and exercised multiple days a week on her own, supplementing her training with Pilates and yoga, according to Elin G. Schran, Hughes’ Boston-based coach.
“Usually, people who are skating at her level eat, breathe, and sleep their sport,” Schran says. “For her to be getting off the ice and have to go to class was crazy—it’s completely unheard of.”
And Hughes’s skating commitments often went beyond the extracurricular involvements of even the most dedicated of her classmates at Harvard, according to Dean of Freshman Thomas A. Dingman ‘67, Hughes’ freshman advisor.
“There are all sorts of stars in the class, people who are doing things on a regional or a national or an international level,” he said. “The skating regimen is pretty relentless...I think what was required of her was pretty unusual.”
But Hughes could not let the possibility of participating in the 2010 Winter Olympics slip past her. Blockmate Claire M Wheeler ’11 remembers sitting with Hughes on their futon in Mather at 3:30 in the morning last March, when the skater was deciding whether she should give the Olympics one more try.
“It was a very difficult decision for her...It’s good that she gave it one last hurrah to see if she could do it,” Wheeler says. “If she did make the Olympics, we wanted to get a Winnebago and go up to Vancouver.”
With her heart set on competing in the Olympics for the second time, Hughes returned home to New York to train with her long-time coach Bonni Retzkin. She practiced intensively throughout the summer and the fall semester.
“I missed pretty much two years of competing while being here [at Harvard] and had to get back to where I was before,” Hughes says. “I spent a lot more time on the ice than I have in the past.”
Hughes qualified for the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in January, where she placed ninth overall, but did not qualify for the Olympic team.
“It was definitely an experience that I would have done again if I had the chance,” Hughes says of her semester off.
THE HARVARD OLYMPIAN
The ice rink has long been an alternate home for two of Hughes’ family members: her father played ice hockey as an undergraduate at Cornell, and her older sister—the 24-year-old Sarah Hughes—won a gold medal in figure skating at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.
“I think it’s inevitable to compare us,” Emily muses about her famous sister. “But what’s really bad about being compared to an Olympic gold medalist?”
Hughes’s love affair with skating began at the age of three, when her mother would take her out to the rink with her older siblings. Soon enough, her bouts on the rink evolved into a passion for figure skating, and in the 2004 to 2005 season, Hughes began to compete at the senior national level.
“I love competition and the rush that you get when you’re out there,” Hughes says. “I love the freedom...when you’re just skating on the ice.”
After winning the bronze medal at the 2006 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, Hughes was named the first alternate for the 2006 Winter Olympics. But when Michelle Kwan withdrew due to a hip injury, Hughes—then a junior in high school—found herself flying to Torino on short notice to compete in the Olympics.
“I remember the first time I skated over the Olympic rings,” Hughes says. “I don’t think that practice went so well because I was just in awe of everything.”
As her family cheered from the stands, Hughes was overwhelmed with the commission of representing her country and the reality of competing before an audience of unprecedented size, she says.
“The crowd was behind me, and when they start getting loud, it definitely gets you through that four minutes a lot more easily,” Hughes says.
Though she could not participate in the opening ceremonies, Hughes says that one of her favorite memories from her Olympic experience was walking with Team U.S.A. in the closing ceremonies.
“It was just a whirlwind. It was insane,” Hughes says of her Torino experience. “There’s nothing else like it.”
NOT JUST ALL SPORT
Coming off of her Olympic debut and an eighth place finish at the 2006 World Figure Skating Championships, Hughes went through yet another grueling test of her abilities—the college application process.
Her two older sisters both tried their hands at convincing Hughes of applying to their respective alma maters, Harvard and Yale. But one college stood above the rest.
“When I came to visit here, it was just an amazing place,” Hughes says of Harvard. “I couldn’t see myself anywhere else.”
Freshman year was “really funny,” Hughes recalls. Though many of her classmates at Harvard heard that there was a former Olympian among them, they did not know that the rumored individual was actually her. Since then, Hughes has emerged from obscurity as a stunningly accomplished athlete who is grounded in her life as a Harvard student.
Hughes has been an active member of the Harvard University Figure Skating Club, where she is seen as a “role model,” according to Club Co-President Kristina A. Nolte ’10.
“She’s really down to earth and into giving people tips,” Nolte says of the former Olympian. “She’s really friendly and approachable on the ice.”
Hughes has also found a strong athletic community at Harvard, including her roommates in Mather House. Hughes’ blockmate Jacqueline M. Alemany ’11, a basketball player, says that their shared athletic interests have helped them become closer friends.
“Athlete to athlete, it’s easier to understand where someone’s coming from, even if you don’t know the sport,” Alemany says.
But for all the rigors of the sport and the added stress of balancing her schoolwork, Hughes—whose favorite Harvard-related memory is attending the Harvard-Yale football game freshman year—knows how to make time for her more social extracurricular activities.
“My favorite times with her are staying up really late at night and realizing that you have a huge load of work to do,” says Wheeler, Hughes’ blockmate. “She will make sure we have all the snacks ready, and we probably talk more than we should.”
BACK TO CAMBRIDGE
Hughes returned to Harvard for the spring semester, resuming her dual dedication to school and skating.
“Being back here is nice. It’s kind of like a home away from home,” Hughes says. “I was actually really excited to go back to class, which might seem kind of odd.”
Hughes, a sociology concentrator with a secondary field in government, says that her future plans remain uncertain and that she continues to hone her intellectual interests. Hughes, who has been attending events at the Institute of Politics, says she wishes to increase her involvement on campus.
Hughes continues to participate in the Harvard Figure Skating Club, and she has even watched some of the Vancouver Games’ figure skating competitions with its club members. This spring, Hughes will perform at the 40th anniversary “Evening With Champions,” an annual performance that benefits the Harvard-affiliate Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
It was a bittersweet ceremony for the seniors of the Harvard men’s hockey team Saturday night, who celebrated the last regular-season home game of their careers with their families after a heartbreaking 4-2 loss to Colgate at Bright Hockey Center.
Interestingly, on Senior Night it was the freshmen that led the Crimson (13-13-6, 10-8-2 ECAC) in the loss to the Raiders (7-17-3, 7-10-3), as goals from freshman forward Luke Greiner and classmate Danny Biega at opportune moments kept Harvard within striking distance of Colgate.
“[The freshmen] have played a large part consistently throughout the year,” captain Alex Biega said. “Once again, they gave us a chance to battle back, and we rely on them a great deal. Hopefully they can keep contributing throughout the rest of the season and going into the playoffs.”
The Crimson’s seniors were named to the starting lineup, and fourth-year goaltender John Riley made his first start at home—the third of his career.
“I think our guys went after it, left it on the ice, and worked hard,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “I feel bad on Senior Night that we weren’t able to get the win.”
The Raiders jumped out to an early lead with a goal at 4:40 into the first from sophomore forward Austin Smith.
At the start of the second, junior goaltender Kyle Richter replaced Riley in net. Colgate dominated the Crimson offensively in that period, leading in shots on goal, 20-13. With such constant offensive pressure, the Raiders stretched their lead to two, as junior forward Brian Day found the back of the net. Day’s lobbed shot floated into the goal following a pileup in front of the net.
After a brief stoppage in play due to an ankle injury to one of the officials, Greiner netted a goal of his own at 10:48 of the second. Colgate’s Jason Williams fell to start the play, creating a man-up scenario for Harvard at the other end of the rink. Greiner was able to capitalize on the advantage, assisted by junior forward Michael Del Mauro and Richter.  Williams redeemed himself with the game-winner at 10:40 in the third. Now down 3-1, the Crimson turned on its offensive firepower, outshooting the Raiders by a margin of six in the period.
Danny Biega came up big for Harvard at 12:57 in the third, putting his team within a goal once again with a slapshot from behind the circle. The Crimson pulled its goalkeeper with a minute left in the game and created several scoring opportunities in that last minute, including a near-miss by sophomore forward Alex Killorn with less than 30 seconds to play.
With 13.4 seconds remaining, the tension peaked on a Colgate timeout, as Harvard knew it would have one last chance to tie up the game. Unfortunately for the Crimson, the strong third-period team effort was not enough to carry it to a victory, as its last opportunity was snuffed out by the Raider defense. Colgate sealed the deal with an empty-net goal to put them up by two with two seconds left to play. Despite impressive goaltending from both Riley and Richter, the early hole would never completely close.
“The ice is tough in those last 30 seconds,” Donato said. “But I thought we moved the puck around a little better [than Friday night], and we generated more shots.”
Colgate and Harvard ranked sixth and eighth in the ECAC, respectively, before Saturday’s meeting. After the Raiders and Dartmouth battled to a 6-6 tie on Friday night, Colgate heads into the final week of the regular season on a solid 1-0-1 weekend. Only the top eight teams in the ECAC earn home-ice advantage for the upcoming tournament, so next week’s away games are must-wins for the Crimson.
“We’re in the driver’s seat,” Donato said. “Nobody can take home ice away from us, from the sounds of it, if we go out and win two games next weekend, so that’s the challenge.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One is a traditional powerhouse that’s hosting the EISA championships next weekend and has two alums competing for Team USA in Vancouver. The other is an upstart program from Boston without a home course. One placed fourth overall, and the other placed ninth.
But at the Williams Ski Carnival, the city slickers had their way on skate skis. The Harvard women’s Nordic team topped the Middlebury Panthers in the 5k free race, as the schools went 6th and 7th, respectively.
“It was a really good weekend for us,” Nordic captain Audrey Mangan said. “We beat Middlebury [in the 5k free], which was really good. It’s exciting.”
The women’s nordic team has been a contender in the classic events all season long, and its breakout skate skiing race marks it as a legitimate threat. Once again, the team put together a strong classic race en route to a fifth-place finish, even topping the University of New Hampshire, which placed third overall in the carnival.
Mangan had been lurking in the background the past two weekends while her freshmen teammates Alena Tofte and Esther Kennedy garnered attention, but the Williams course suited the senior’s 5’9’’ stature.
“It was a course that favored tall people because a lot of it is flat,” Mangan said. “It uses upper body strength.”
Mangan seized the opportunity, placing 13th in the classic event and 17th in the free event. With Kennedy, Tofte, and junior Cara Sprague finishing 17th, 22nd, and 29th in the classic event, the team took 3 spots in the top 25 and four in the top 30. Kennedy and Tofte followed that up with back to back finishes in the skate skiing event, taking 27th and 28th in the 5k free.
But, overall, the day was Mangan’s.
“Audrey was phenomenal,” said Nordic coach Chris City ’94.
Another emerging strength for the Crimson is the women’s giant slalom, in which Harvard took sixth. Sophomore Caroline McHugh led the way with an 18th-place finish in the event.
“Caroline McHugh had another fantastic day,” Alpine Coach Tim Mitchell said. “[It’s been] three consecutive GS’s where she’s been top 25 or so. She’s starting in the 50s, so she’s cutting her start number in half. She’s doing exceptionally well.”
Meanwhile, the men’s alpine team showed improvement, moving from 10th  place to 9th in the slalom.
“They moved up a spot,” Mitchell said. “They finally started to have consistent finishes. They’ve been going fast. Unfortunately it’s close to the end of the season.”
For its part, the men’s alpine team placed 11th in both the classic and free events.
In the end, nothing changed in the overall order for the Crimson or for the top teams. Despite breakthrough performances, eighth place still remained elusive for Harvard by over 100 points, while the Crimson managed to hold ninth place by 99 points.
At the other end of the pack, the competition was much closer. The University of Vermont stormed out to a 40 point lead and looked like it might finally end Dartmouth’s undefeated streak. But the Big Green rallied to win four events and take the Carnival by only two points.
Part of the reason for a shake-up in the early results may have been tricky wind conditions on Friday.
“It was very difficult conditions,” Mitchell said. “It was incredibly windy. There were some people that skied really well and went slow and some who skied mediocre and caught wind [and went fast].”
Such conditions may make results equally unpredictable as the teams head into the Eastern Intercollegiate Ski Association Championships next weekend at Rikert and Snow Bowl.
The Crimson Alpine team had success earlier this season at the Bowl in exhibition races.
“The girls are really looking forward to racing there,” Mitchell said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As conference rivals Harvard and No. 10 Cornell clashed for the second time this season, the game of 60 minutes came down to 25 decisive seconds. In that short span of the second period, the Big Red took an unanswered two-goal lead. Both the Crimson and Cornell battled through a scoreless first period, although the Big Red held a dominant 11-6 shot advantage.
Junior goaltender Kyle Richter had two penalty kills on Cornell’s consecutive power plays to preserve a blank scoreboard, which Harvard was able to maintain until halfway through the second period. It was at that point that the Big Red launched an offensive attack—one that lasted less than a minute but crippled the Crimson for the remainder of the game. The first blow came 10:14 into the period, when junior Tyler Roeszler connected with teammate Nick D’Agostino to net the opening goal of the night.
Roeszler’s goal was followed only 25 seconds later by another from sophomore Ross Keir off of an assist by Riley Nash. Although Harvard would try for a comeback in the third period, a final goal from forward Blake Gallagher with 21.6 seconds left in the game on an open net guaranteed the Cornell victory. The score was representative of a match where one team held the momentum, established a strong defensive front, and carried the intensity of a longtime Ivy rivalry.
IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT
After each of the Big Red’s three goals, its abundant and rowdy fans would point at Richter and taunt, “It’s all your fault.”
But the cheer was far from the truth. Richter had to defend against a team that came out hitting hard, that constantly kept pressure on a Crimson defense that had trouble clearing the puck from its half, and that dominated in the shot count. The junior posted 19 of his 23 saves in the first two periods—one of the only reasons his team even had a fighting chance against Cornell.
“I think Kyle was solid in net...[But] in the first two periods, we just didn’t battle hard enough,” said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91.
The final goal, scored by the Big Red in the waning seconds of the third period, actually had nothing to do with Richter, who had been substituted in favor of another attacker. The open net and—at times—lackluster defense held more accountability for the goals than Richter.
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
The shot count posted by the Crimson in the first two periods epitomizes why it could not score and why the majority of the game’s momentum came from Cornell’s end. Harvard was only able to establish six shots in the first period and two in the second, compared to the Big Red’s 22 in the same time.
“They were playing with the momentum for the better part of two periods,” captain Alex Biega said.
Donato also noted that the Big Red shut down the Harvard offense, blocking a number of the Crimson’s shots before they even reached the net.
Fourteen, in fact, was the staggering number of blocks executed by the Big Red over the course of the opening two periods.
But the third period was a completely different story for Harvard. Without much momentum in the early part of the game, the Crimson came out in the final period and put up a strong fight to try and overcome the two goal deficit that stood in the way of an upset against its Ivy rival.
Harvard put 14 shots on the net—nearly twice the number of the first two periods combined—only to have them all blocked by Big Red defenders or saved by Cornell’s senior goaltender Ben Scrivens. Although the surge in the final period proved to be insufficient for a Crimson victory, it was a surprisingly bright spot in an otherwise bleak, one-sided game.
“The third period was much better for us,” Richter said. “I think there’s some positive for us to take into the next game and the remainder of the season.”

The Cornell offense needed only 25 seconds to secure the scoreboard in Harvard’s 3-0 defeat at Bright Hockey Center on Friday night.
Tallying two quick goals about halfway through the second period, the rival No. 10 Big Red (16-8-3, 13-5-2 ECAC) built up a lead that would be too difficult for the Crimson (7-17-3, 7-10-3 ECAC) to overcome.
“I thought our team battled, especially in the third period, but we put ourselves behind the eight ball with a poor second period,”  said Harvard coach Ted Donato ’91. “They’re a very good team, and you have to be able to put together 60 solid minutes, and we weren’t able to.”
With a packed home arena and a century-long rivalry between the two ice hockey teams, the stakes were high for the Crimson. But a slow start led to the squad’s ultimate loss.
In a scoreless first period, Harvard killed two consecutive Big Red power plays and was able to contain the Cornell offense. Junior goaltender Kyle Richter came up strong between the pipes for the Crimson, stopping 11 first-period shots, with six coming on the penalty kill. He would go on to log 23 saves for the game.
“I think Kyle was solid in net in the first period,” Donato said. “He allowed us a chance to come back and play a better second period, but we didn’t.”
The game quickly changed for Harvard when Big Red fourth-line winger Tyler Roeszler lit the lamp on a shot from the slot about halfway through the second.
Cornell struck just 25 seconds later when Big Red defensemen Keir Ross fired a shot past a screened Richter to double the lead.
Cornell then carried its momentum through the end of the period and shut down the Crimson’s offense, limiting the home team to just two shots in the second.
“We’re not going to win any hockey games when we only establish eight shots in the first two periods,” captain Alex Biega said. “They got a good lead, but, unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to battle back.”
“They pretty much shut us down in their end and were able to control the puck in our zone in the second period,” Donato added. “With a team that is that defensively sound and has that type of goaltender, it’s a tough hill to climb.”
Harvard gained momentum in the third, putting 14 shots on goal in comparison to the Big Red’s five. With a little over a minute left, the Crimson pulled Richter in favor of another attacker in its last attempt to score, but Cornell’s defense and goaltender Ben Scrivens stayed strong to maintain the shutout. The Big Red was also able to capitalize on Harvard’s open net with 21.6 seconds remaining, increasing its lead to 3-0 and locking up the win.
“They made it difficult for us to get to the net,” Donato said. “They blocked a ton of shots. I thought in the third period, we battled through and were able to get some more pucks to the net, but they are a very sound team in a lot of areas.”
And when playing tough teams, every minute counts.
“We turned it on a little in the third period, but it was too late,” Biega said.
“It comes down to playing 60 minutes,” Richter added. “We’ve been stressing that this whole year, and it’s been something we’ve been having trouble with. Tonight was...an example of not playing a full game.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With time for one last play and the Harvard women’s basketball team holding on to a two-point lead, Columbia All-Ivy forward Judie Lomax put up the final shot, confident that it would fall through the net to send the game into overtime.
What she didn’t know, apparently, was where Emma Markley was on the court.
Lomax’s hopes for a game-tying shot were quickly put to rest, as the Crimson junior forward put up a huge block that allowed Harvard (16-7, 7-2 Ivy) to escape Levein Gymnasium with a 69-67 win over Columbia (15-9, 6-4) on Saturday night.
“Emma said ‘no’ [to Lomax] big time,” freshman forward Victoria Lippert said. “That was a huge stop right there. It was a great finish.”
With Lomax on the court, the Lions had three possessions off offensive rebounds to convert the needed bucket. And though Lomax might have the advantage when it comes to rebounding, Markley did what she does best—block shots.
“I was pretty sure she was going to get the rebound,” Markley said. “When she got the ball, I decided to make sure that she wasn’t going to get the shot.”
Markley’s well-timed block was part of a 10-point, 12-rebound double-double performance–her sixth of the season—and it could not have come at a better time for the Crimson. The victory over Columbia solidified its second-place standing in the Ivy League and put the Lions—who entered the game with a one-game advantage over Harvard—in third. But as expected, the win did not come easily.
“Columbia was coming at us,” Lippert said. “We knew that we had to bring our A-game.”
The Lions opened up the first half with their signature full-court press. While the constant pressure from Columbia failed to stymie the Crimson from advancing the ball up the court, it was self-inflicted turnovers that prevented Harvard from taking a lead going into halftime.
“We had a couple of turnovers that didn’t really need to happen,” Lippert said. “When we were trying to fast break, our passes were a little bit off, and we didn’t quite finish.”
“For a while, we were playing very timidly,” Markley added. “We were afraid to shoot [the ball].”
Regardless, Harvard entered the break down by just one, 34-33, thanks to a buzzer-beating trey from sophomore point guard Brogan Berry.
Though the Crimson’s 14 first-half turnovers offset its 59.1-percent shooting clip, Harvard played stifling defense of its own, attacking the boards and limiting Lomax—the nation’s leading rebounder—to just one offensive rebound.
Lomax would eventually find her place inside the paint, dominating the second half with her 17-point, eight-rebound performance. But it was Lippert who stole the show.
The freshman sensation continued her impressive rookie campaign with a career-high 28 points on 9-for-11 shooting, including a perfect 2-for-2 from behind the arc.
“Sometimes you just get in the groove,” Lippert said. “I felt pretty good today, but this wouldn’t have happened without my teammates giving me the ball. They do a great job of finding me and getting me those open looks.”
“Victoria’s a phenomenal player,” Markley said. “She’s very strong, she can get to the hole, she can score. She’s always looking to get open, which makes her even more of a threat.”
Yet even Lippert’s outstanding effort was not enough to help the Crimson pull away from Columbia in the second half.
With 5:36 to go, Harvard used a 9-0 run to take a 62-55 lead, but Columbia responded with 10 unanswered points of its own to pull ahead by three.
But a trey and a pair of clutch free throws from Berry would pull the Crimson back ahead by two with just 47 seconds to go.
It wouldn’t be until Markley’s block–and the sound of the buzzer–that the win would be sealed for Harvard.
Having won its past four games by at least 15 points, the Crimson was forced to find a new way to win, and it succeeded.
“We always say one shot at a time,” Lippert said. “We had to focus on each individual possession and value it. We had to concentrate on each individual play, take the smart play on offense, and stay confident with making the decisions with our shooting.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
One night after Harvard handily lost the three-point battle to Cornell, the trey was perhaps its biggest weapon.
The Crimson hit 10-of-22 threes Saturday, including a blistering 8-of-13 in the first half that helped build an early lead over Columbia.
“[It was] a little different in terms of the size of players we were shooting over tonight versus last,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said.
Against the Big Red, the Crimson managed to hit just two triples while Cornell knocked down 12 from long range.
“[Tonight] we worked the ball well; we were confident,” Amaker said. “It’s amazing how things become contagious.”
The barrage of three-pointers began with the first basket of the game, when co-captain Jeremy Lin connected from the right corner.
After Lin’s bucket, sophomore guard Oliver McNally took over. McNally went 4-for-5 from beyond the arc in the opening frame en route to scoring 20 first-half points.
“In those rhythms, people mess up by trying to take all kinds of shots,” McNally said. “I kept taking good shots, so I was able to streak some together.”
The sophomore hit four threes over a span of 10 minutes to help build a 10-9 deficit into a 34-16 lead.
Before the close of the half, Harvard was able to widen the gap even further thanks to a pair of freshmen.
With 25 seconds left and the shot clock winding down, Curry buried a three from the left wing. Lions guard Niko Scott banked home a field goal on the other end with seven seconds left, allowing the Crimson just enough time for one more shot.
Curry raced the ball up court, slicing into the lane before passing it out to freshman guard Dee Giger in the left corner. Giger gathered himself and knocked down a trey as time expired to give Harvard a 45-26 lead.
“[If] you make a few of them early, runs have a way of taking on a life of [their] own,” Amaker said of the Crimson’s hot shooting.
SMALL BALL
Even though sophomore Keith Wright played against Cornell and suited up Saturday night, the Harvard big man did not see any action.
“He needs practice,” Amaker said. “I don’t want it to be where we’re using him in the game and then we can’t have him for practice.”
The result of the depleted frontcourt—the only experienced forwards were co-captain Doug Miller and freshman Kyle Casey—was a variety of small lineups that spread the floor on offense and pressured the ball on defense.
“One of the older tricks in the game is that if you’re worried about the way that you can match up, try to create something [so] that they’ll adjust to you,” Amaker said.
At one point, the Crimson’s biggest player on the court was the 6’6”, 180-pound Giger.
“I think it’s very fun when we play small,” Curry said. “We’re flying on defense, we’re four-out-one-in, and we’re just playing.”
DON’T ACT LIKE YOU’RE NOT IMPRESSED
Saturday’s contest featured a pair of highlight-reel dunks. The first came five minutes into the second half, when Columbia guard Noruwa Agho launched a three-pointer that rattled off the rim. Lions forward Ansenso Ampim swooped in, grabbed the rebound in the air, and slammed it home in one motion.
Midway through the second half, Casey stole the ball on the perimeter and took off downcourt uncontested. He gathered himself on two feet and threw down a one-handed jam to the crowd’s delight.
At least one observer, though, was unimpressed.
“It was kind of weak,” Curry said. “I was hoping he was going to windmill it.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
When the game—and playoff home ice—is on the line, it’s hard to predict how a women’s hockey team will react.
On Friday night, St. Lawrence got desperate. But with the pressure on, Harvard senior Randi Griffin kept her cool.
Griffin converted a penalty shot with just 24.3 seconds on the clock to lift the No. 5 Crimson to a 2-1 win over the Saints (15-12-7, 11-8-3) at Appleton Arena. The victory gave Harvard coach Katey Stone 337 wins for her career—tying the NCAA all-time record.
“It was a really good game, back and forth,” Griffin said. “It literally came down to the last few minutes, which was exciting—they fought really hard.”
With the score knotted and time winding down, the Crimson dumped the puck into its offensive zone. As Harvard moved into a pattern, St. Lawrence netminder Maxie Weisz was knocked down by a teammate, putting her in the goal and out of commission.
No whistle blew, and the Crimson picked up the puck and put it on the undefended net.
But as the shot flew towards the goal, a Saint intentionally knocked the net off its moorings—causing the referees to award Harvard a penalty shot.
Stone tapped Griffin to take the shot.
“You have to choose someone who’s on the ice,” junior Kate Buesser explained. “[Griffin] faked the goalie out and put it in the left side of the [net].”
Though the penalty shot turned out to be a game-changer, for Griffin it was routine.
“We have a tradition where we have a showcase game every week—seniors and juniors versus freshmen and sophomores—a breakaway competition to see which team has more breakaways,” Griffin said. “We did a little cheer and called it the way we do [for the showcase]. I just tried to get myself in that state of mind. It’s something we do in practice every week.”
But Griffin’s late-game heroics wouldn’t have been possible without the Crimson’s third-period comeback.
Although Harvard started its longest road trip of the conference season with a bang—outshooting St. Lawrence, 7-0—in the first 10 minutes of play, it couldn’t find a way to solve Weisz, who made 11 saves in each of the first two frames.
But the Crimson’s defense, backstopped by freshman Laura Bellamy, kept the Saints off the board through two first-period power plays—limiting St. Lawrence to just two shots in four minutes of man-up action.
“[The defense] played really well,” Buesser said. “The less time we can spend in our defensive end, the better.”
Harvard got its first power play of the game early in the second period, when Saint Kelly Sabatine was whistled for tripping.
Junior Liza Ryabkina got the best look at the net during the man advantage, getting an open shot in the slot, but Weisz came up with another save.
The momentum began to shift in the home team’s favor late in the second, as St. Lawrence snapped the scoreless tie with a minute to play in the period.
Alley Bero put the puck on Vanessa Emond’s stick, and Emond wrapped around behind the net to get the puck past an out-of-position Bellamy.
Facing a 1-0 deficit at the start of the third, it took the Crimson 12:37 to get even.
Buesser slid a centering pass to freshman Jillian Dempsey in the slot, and the rookie went top-shelf to tie the game.
“I lost sight of it, and I just bounced it to [Dempsey],” Buesser said. “She just ripped it right into the net.”
Bellamy stood tall in the final frame, stopping all of the Saints’ nine shots in the period—including a close-range shot from St. Lawrence senior Tara Akstull.
After Griffin’s penalty shot gave Harvard the lead, the Saints pulled Weisz from the net but were unable to convert with the extra skater.
Though the win did have important playoff implications, setting the Crimson up for home-ice advantage in this weekend’s opening round of the ECAC tournament, it had historical significance as well.
Stone’s 337th win ties former Colby and Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson’s NCAA career record. The coach, in her 16th year behind the Harvard bench, has a chance to break that mark at home this weekend.
“She didn’t say anything about it, but we all knew it was going on,” Buesser said. “It just shows what she’s done for this program. You don’t get where she is without a great coaching style.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
With its hopes of an Ivy League title nearly washed away following a nine-point loss to Cornell on Friday, the Harvard men’s basketball team could have easily packed it in the rest of the way.
But less than 24 hours after falling two games behind the Big Red in the Ancient Eight standings, the Crimson (18-6, 7-3 Ivy) caught fire in Saturday night’s matchup, exploding to a 77-57 victory over Columbia (9-15, 3-7) at Lavietes Pavilion behind 50-percent shooting from the floor and a career-high 23 points from sophomore point guard Oliver McNally.
“Especially bouncing back from last night with obviously a tough loss...you really worry about a letdown, and I thought our kids gave incredible spirit and energy to start the game and put them on their heels,” Harvard coach Tommy Amaker said. “I was very pleased.”
After shooting 20 percent from deep against Cornell, the Crimson lit it up from beyond the arc, knocking down 10 three-pointers on 22 attempts. McNally led the Harvard sharpshooters, hitting five treys on the night and four in the first half alone.
McNally came out firing, and before the first half ended, the sophomore had already surpassed his previous career high of 18 points. McNally tallied his career-matching point with 4:03 left in the half when co-captain Jeremy Lin attacked the basket and then kicked it out to the sophomore, who was spotted up on the perimeter. McNally’s shot sailed through the hoop, giving Harvard the 34-16 lead and McNally a personal 18-16 edge over the Lions.
When the Crimson entered the locker room, McNally had already totaled 20 points on 7-of-8 shooting, with his only miss a three-pointer that rattled in and then out of the basket.
“He was hot,” said freshman point guard Brandyn Curry. “When someone is hot like that, you’ve got to get him the ball. [McNally] was just making shots left and right, and I was just trying to find him. ”
Curry, who replaced McNally in the starting lineup following the Crimson’s loss to Princeton for defensive purposes, turned in a strong performance himself, finishing with seven points, six rebounds, five assists, and two steals in 28 minutes.
“That’s a tremendous line for that kid,” Amaker said. “I think his confidence is there.”
Curry led Harvard in its attempt to disrupt the Columbia offense by pressuring the Lions’ guards. The strategy was largely successful, as Curry was able to force a five-second violation early on and then continued to throw off Columbia’s timing throughout the night.
“We wanted to see if we could push up the floor and have good ball pressure and try to take them out of things that they like to run in their sets,” Amaker said.
While the strategy largely paid off, the Crimson’s aggressive style of play did get it whistled for nine first-half fouls, allowing the Lions to keep themselves afloat from the charity stripe.
Columbia even took the 10-9 lead five minutes into the game after Noruwa Agho, who entered the weekend as the Ivy League’s second-leading scorer, sank a three-pointer from the corner.
But Harvard countered with a 15-0 run over the next six minutes to take a commanding 14-point lead that would stay at double digits for the rest of the night.
McNally sparked the run after the Agho three-pointer, receiving a pass on the perimeter from Curry and then knocking down the triple. McNally struck again from deep when Harvard took back possession. Curry pulled down an offensive rebound and then kicked it out to the perimeter, where Lin swung it to McNally, who drained the three-ball, putting the Crimson ahead, 15-10.
“I try to just take shots that are in rhythm that are there,” McNally said. “I don’t try to force anything. In our motion offense we were cutting really hard and when we do that, we get a lot open shots.”
Columbia would not come within striking distance again, as the Crimson lead ballooned to as much as 24 in the second half before settling at 20 at the game’s end.
The victory is the squad’s 18th of the season, one shy of matching the most wins in a season in Harvard history.
“Winning the Ivy’s going to be a little bit tougher,” Curry said, “but we still have a lot of history to make.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Her name may resemble the Andy Griffith Show, but Randi Griffin’s performance against No. 6 Clarkson (20-9-5, 14-5-3 ECAC) was no laughing matter. The Harvard senior neutralized the Golden Knights’ three goals with a hat trick of her own in a 3-3 tie at Cheel Arena, turning a showdown between ECAC powers into a one-woman show.
For all Griffin’s brilliance, it was Clarkson that stole the show early on, storming out to a two-goal lead in the first half of the game. The No. 5 Crimson (18-6-5, 13-6-3) held off the Golden Knights for the first 10 minutes, but Clarkson kept the pressure on while its first power-play unit lay dormant in the arsenal.
“We knew [their] strength was their first power-play unit,” Griffin said. “They’ve got some kids who can really shoot the puck. We knew it was coming.”
The Golden Knights were finally able to unleash that weapon when Harvard junior Liza Ryabkina got sent to the penalty box for slashing at 12:33. Sixteen seconds later, Clarkson junior Melissa Waldie found the back of the net off a rebound of sophomore Juana Baribeau’s slapshot. It was Waldie’s ninth power-play goal of the season.
The Golden Knights struck again a little over five minutes into the second period, when sophomore Gabrielle Kosziwska tapped in a rebound to put Clarkson up by two.
And then it was time for the Randi Griffin show.
“It’s been something that’s coming all season,” junior forward Kate Buesser said. “She’s had so many chances.”
A stroke of luck didn’t hurt either, as the senior’s intended pass on the power play bounced into the cage for her first tally of the afternoon.
“The first goal was a little fluky,” Griffin admitted.
Fluke or not, the goal was a momentum changer, as it moved the Crimson from an imposing two-goal deficit to a more routine one-goal margin—which Harvard had already overcome the night before.
“When you’re down two goals, two goals seems like a lot,” Griffin said. “One goal doesn’t seem so far off.”
The unheralded senior continued to take the Golden Knights by surprise, with her second goal coming on a line change.
“We like to keep one player on the ice to keep the pressure on,” Buesser said.
While many of the skaters were zooming to and from the bench, Griffin was speeding toward the goal, where she was hit with a pass from co-captain Cori Bassett.
And, just as before, the senior converted.
“She hit the top corner,” Buesser said, “which was awesome.”
But Griffin still had one more goal left in her, and, once again, Bassett was there to help her out, sliding Griffin the puck as she darted down the weak side. The senior completed her hat trick and notched her fourth goal of the weekend by sending the puck past Clarkson goaltender Lauren Dahm.
“She gives the team a lot of intensity and a lot of fire,” Buesser said.
In just 10 minutes, Griffin had turned a two-goal deficit into a one-goal lead that the Crimson carried into the final period. It was the first hat trick of Griffin’s career.
“I don’t think I’ve ever scored more than one goal in a game before,” she said. “Some days you shoot the puck, and it just goes in.”
But just as Harvard hadn’t folded when it fell down two goals, the Golden Knights didn’t disappear, going shot for shot with the Crimson in the third period.
“No team’s going to go away,” Buesser said. “No team’s going to give up this time of year.”
A loose puck in Harvard’s defensive zone stirred up the Crimson enough for Clarkson to slip past it.
“They were able to get the puck off the scrum,” Buesser said. “No one could locate the puck. It wasn’t great, but at the same time, you have to give credit to them for working hard the entire time.”
While Harvard couldn’t bring home a win, it still had enough fuel to secure the third seed in the playoffs and will open the conference tourney next weekend against Princeton at Bright Hockey Center.
“Clarkson is a great team,” Buesser said. “We just counteracted that just fine. It’s a good setup to what this tournament is going to be—very tight hockey. It was a good game to go into the playoffs with.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
While the ending records were positive, the coach and players of the Harvard men’s and women’s fencing teams couldn’t shake a sense of disappointment.
The Crimson traveled to Ithaca, N.Y. this weekend for Part I of the Ivy League Championships, in which the squad faced off against the University of Pennsylvania, Yale, and Cornell. The men emerged with a 1-1 record, beating the Bulldogs and falling to the Quakers, while the women finished 2-1, falling to Penn as well but beating Yale and Cornell.
“I anticipated on the women’s side that we should’ve won,” head coach Peter Brand said. “I really felt that we could beat Penn.”
Both teams started off with a close loss to the Quakers. The No. 9 Harvard women won the majority of the sabre bouts over the No. 10 Quakers, but lost foil by a score of 7-2 and epée by a score of 6-3, leading to a final deficit of 17-10.
“We just had a very weak performance from the epée squad,” Brand said. “We had some problems on the foil side too. Our sabre squad was very good, very consistent all day.”
The foils were particularly underwhelming. One of the Crimson’s strongest squads this season, the trio could not pull themselves together.
“Our strongest squad is the foil squad,” Brand said. “They dominate and they’ve been very successful all year long...except against Penn. It was a disaster and an anomaly.”
The No. 6 men also lost in a tight match to the No. 7 Quakers. Though Harvard dominated epée, 7-2, with a 3-0 performance by sophomore James Hawrot, it lost foil, 8-1, and sabre, 5-4, en route to a 15-12 defeat.
“We had another very close match with Penn, as we did last year,” Brand said. “It could’ve gone either way.”
Brand cited a “very weak performance” by the foil squad as part of the problem. Plagued by inconsistency throughout the year, the group is still trying to find its rhythm.
“[Freshman] Tommaso [di Robilant] is consistent, the other two were up and down,” Brand said of the foil fencers. “[Consistent success] hasn’t happened yet, and I’m hoping it will change.”
For both the men and the women, slow starts were a problem against the Quakers.
“Everyone seemed to get off to a really, really slow start,” sophomore epée Noam Mills said. “Penn was our first team, which really didn’t work out [in our favor]. To get really going takes some time. By Cornell we were really fencing, like we could have against Penn.”
As Mills noted, after the difficult Penn losses the road was smooth for the Crimson. Harvard first faced and beat its historic rival, Yale, in two easy wins.
Though the Bulldogs had gained momentum from a crushing defeat of Columbia, the Crimson men triumphed over them, 16-11, with a 7-2 showing in epée, 4-5 in foil, and 5-4 in sabre.
“The men did really well,” Mills said. “Yale [was] fencing really well—better than everybody expected.”
The women had an equally strong showing, dropping sabre, 5-4, but winning epée, 5-4, and dominating foil, 8-1. Sophomore Shelby MacLeod and senior Arielle Pensler, both foils, each went 3-0 in their bouts.
Finally, the women’s team faced the Big Red and won handily again. Harvard rode an 8-1 sabre victory and two 5-4 scores in the other categories to a total winning margin of 18-9.
Both the men’s and women’s sabre squads were consistently good in the tournament, and the men’s epée performance was formidable. Among the rest of the squads, performances were inconsistent at best.
“Maybe some of us got a bit too cocky,” Mills said. “Everyone could’ve fenced a little bit better.”
One notable fencer was sophomore sabre Caroline Vloka, who went a perfect 9-0 on the day.
“[Caroline] had a standout performance today,” Brand said. “She still needs to improve on a couple of things, but they’re fairly minor, and I anticipate that she will finish strong again.”
With these results, Harvard must sweep its opponents next weekend at Part II of the Ivies in order to share the Ivy League title. Facing a very strong Princeton team, Harvard will need an extraordinary performance from every fencer.
“We’re having a meeting tomorrow to impress on everybody that they need to fence their best,” Brand said. “Princeton is strong, but anybody still has a chance to come out on top. Everybody needs to pull their weight, and if they don’t, I will be very angry.”
Fortunately for Brand, the players echo his determination.
“We’re down one, but if we beat Columbia and Princeton we are all set,” Mills said. “We’re really going to have to step it up.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Harvard men’s tennis team traveled to Indiana hoping to taste victory, but instead had to swallow the bitter taste of defeat, as it lost two matchups this weekend.
Harvard suffered its first defeat in a close battle against Purdue (7-2) on Saturday, and the bad luck continued into the squad’s next match against the No. 50 Indiana Hoosiers (4-1) on Sunday. The Crimson (4-4) could not capitalize on the momentum it had from winning its second-consecutive title at the ECAC Championships last weekend.
“I felt the team had a good showing this weekend,” junior Alexei Chijoff-Evans said. “Everybody fought and played hard, but luck just wasn’t on our side.”
NO. 50 INDIANA 6, HARVARD 1
A day after losing a close match, the Harvard men just could not pull it together as they suffered another defeat at the hands of Indiana. The Crimson challenged the Hoosiers, but Indiana had all the answers, as the host team cruised to a 6-1 victory. It was Harvard’s fourth loss of the season and the Hoosiers’ fourth win.
“We fought really hard,” junior Aba Omedele-Lucien said. “The performance was pretty good, but we just didn’t get the wins in the right spots.”
Freshman Andy Nguyen was the only player to pick up a point for his team, as he edged his opponent in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6, at the No. 6 singles position. Omodele-Lucien and freshman Christo Schultz teamed up to defeat their opponents in the doubles portion of the matchup, but the other two pairs failed to win their matches, giving the doubles point to Indiana.
“Christo and I have been playing solid doubles this year,” Omedele-Lucien said. “We came out with a lot more energy than they did, held our service game, and broke them right away. We felt they got a little tight and tried to keep the energy high. We just kept steamrolling and came up with the victory by a landslide.”
Omodele-Lucien and Chijoff-Evans also had the toughest singles showings for the Crimson, dropping their respective matches in three sets. Chijoff-Evans fell, 6-2, 6-7, 7-6, at the top spot, while Omodele-Lucien also picked up the middle set in a losing effort, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3.
PURDUE 4, HARVARD 3
Harvard went into the Purdue match with high hopes of starting the weekend off on the right foot, but could not pull off the win in a tight matchup. The Crimson put up a fight against Purdue but came up just short, as the Boilermakers handed Harvard its third loss of the season.
The Crimson clinched the doubles point with the pairs of Omodele-Lucien/Schultz and sophomore Alistair Felton/Nguyen overpowering their opponents, 8-2 and 8-4, respectively. In singles play, Chijoff-Evans and Nguyen notched wins for the team in straight sets, but the other four players lost close contests against their opponents, giving Purdue the 4-3 win.
Sophomore Davis Mangham and rookie Joshua Tchan endured the closest losses, pushing their opponents to three sets each. Tchan and his opponent at the fourth position were separated by just a break in each set, with Boilermaker Branko Kuzmanovic coming out on top, 7-5, 4-6, 6-4. Mangham also went the distance in a losing effort, dropping the No. 6 singles match, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.
“We lost some key points that would have helped us win against Purdue, but I’m really happy with how everybody played,” Chijoff-Evans said.
After failing to win its two matches this weekend, Harvard sets its sights on turning the season around against Boston College and St. John’s next weekend. The team looks to improve on its record and prepare to play its Ivy League competitors in the future.
“We showed a lot of heart this weekend,” Omedele-Lucien said. “We have a lot of positive aspects to take away, and we’re making ourselves stronger and more prepared for the Ivy League season. We would like to win these matches, but our priority is to use the matches to improve for the Ivy League matches. We just need to play aggressively to beat them.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
For women’s water polo, the Princeton Invitational was a tale of two completely opposite days. The two games played on Saturday, one against Iona and the other against Wagner, were back-and-forth throughout, with Harvard (6-1) coming away with two competitive wins.
In a complete reversal, yesterday’s play featured two blowouts. Against No. 5 Michigan, the Crimson was the victim, but versus George Washington, Harvard easily took the victory.
Finishing the weekend with three wins and matching its win total from its home tournament two weeks ago, Harvard improves to 6-1 for the season—its best start in the last five seasons.
“Last year, we had some of the same situations and couldn’t quite win the games,” sophomore Devan Kennifer said. “This year, we’re a different team.”
The Crimson returns to Princeton next weekend for the ECAC Championships.
“We did a lot of great things...but things get more challenging each successive weekend,” Harvard coach Erik Farrar said.
HARVARD 10, GEORGE WASHINGTON 5
What Michigan did to the Crimson early yesterday morning, Harvard did later in the day to George Washington. The Crimson controlled the game from the first whistle onward, leading, 8-2, going into the fourth quarter.
“The scoring was all over the place against GW,” Farrar said. “It was an overall well-structured, well-balanced attack, and we were successful with it.”
After taking a 2-1 lead to the end of the first quarter, the Crimson led, 5-2, going into halftime. The Colonials were shut out in the third quarter, when Harvard scored three unanswered goals.
As in Saturday’s contest against Wagner, six players split Harvard’s 10 goals. Junior Patricia Smith led the Crimson with three goals in the game, while sophomores Ita Kettleborough-Barton and Kennifer each scored a pair.
NO. 5 MICHIGAN 13, HARVARD 3
“Michigan is obviously a very strong test,” Farrar said the night before the game. “We get a chance to see how good we really are.”
Michigan proved too much for the Crimson to handle, giving Harvard its first loss of the season in a blowout. Though ranked fifth, the Wolverines had three losses coming into the weekend—all against top-10 teams.
“They were very effective in stifling our defense,” Farrar said. “Their national ranking is well-deserved.”
But Harvard improved on its 6-on-5 play from the day before, scoring two goals in its six man-advantage chances. Despite the modest improvement, Farrar was not happy with the overall man-up performance and said that it would be a “key point of emphasis” in the coming week.
The Crimson lost its contest against Michigan last year as well, falling to the Wolverines at home by a score of 13-2.
HARVARD 10, WAGNER 8
Much like the day’s earlier match, Harvard’s defense struggled early against the Seahawks, as the Crimson fell behind, 5-1, after the first quarter.
Harvard shut out Wagner in the second quarter, outscoring it 3-0, and tied the game early in the third quarter.
“It was pretty much a dogfight from there on,” Farrar said.
The Crimson failed to convert on 6-on-5s, going 0-for-8 in the contest.
The Seahawks held a two-goal lead with three minutes to play, but sophomore Monica Zdrojewski scored two goals in the last 2:15 to force an extra period.
In overtime, freshman Elise Molnar scored to give Harvard its first lead of the afternoon, and Kennifer added a second to give the Crimson a two-goal cushion. Six players scored goals in the game, although no Crimson player scored more than two.
“It was a great team effort all around,” Farrar said.
HARVARD 15, IONA 14
Despite allowing six more goals than in any other game this year, the Crimson outscored Iona, 4-2, in the fourth quarter and walked away from the weekend’s first contest with a win.
“We could not find the back of the net...but it was good to know that even if we aren’t at our best, we can still pull out a win,” Kennifer said.
Harvard took nearly 40 shots on goal, with Kennifer scoring five to lead the team.
The Crimson led at the half, but the Killians outscored Harvard, 7-5, in the third quarter. It was not until the fourth quarter that the Crimson could slow down Iona’s offense enough to come away with the one-goal win.
“Iona played a good, scrappy, aggressive kind of game, and they just wouldn’t go away,” Farrar said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The dual season is over, but for some, the journey is just beginning.
The Harvard wrestling team (2-14-1, 0-5 Ivy) closed out the regular season with another pair of difficult losses on the road, falling to Columbia, 30-15, on Friday night before suffering a 44-6 blowout at the hands of No. 6 Cornell on Saturday. The Crimson was outmuscled in both contests, but co-captains J.P. O’Connor and Louis Caputo remained in dominant form, earning four of the team’s five wins on the weekend.
“I thought we made progress with what we’ve been working on—individual guys making progress,” Harvard coach Jay Weiss said. “Obviously [against Cornell] we were kind of overmatched...but I feel really good about some of the efforts.”
Although the Crimson endured another disappointing year of team competition, the end of Ivy League matches signals a shift to the squad’s strength—individual tournaments. Various Harvard grapplers will join No. 1 O’Connor and No. 6 Caputo in the hunt for EIWA championships and, perhaps, a national title.
“I’m so excited right now—I’ve never been more confident, and I don’t think I’ve ever wrestled better,” O’Connor said. “Nothing would make me happier than bringing home a national title for this program, for myself, and for my family. And the great thing is that I’m not the only one pushing for that. Louis is pushing for the exact same goal as I am...He’s been there for me since I’ve gotten here, and I appreciate that.”
NO. 6 CORNELL 44, HARVARD 6
The Big Red put on a show in Ithaca, proving why six of its grapplers are ranked in the top 20 nationally. Troy Nickerson, Mike Grey, Justin Kerber, Mack Lewnes, and Cam Simaz all won by fall against their Crimson counterparts, securing Cornell’s (8-4-1, 4-0) 31st Ancient Eight crown, the squad’s eighth straight. Even though the Big Red claimed its 43rd-consecutive league dual match, by the end of the day, the hosts were not the only ones boasting a streak.
O’Connor (157 lbs.) capped off an undefeated regular season with a 7-2 decision over Derek Schreiner. The senior standout used two early takedowns to build a lead and did not let up. O’Connor followed with a second-period reversal and, despite giving up a third-period score, maintained control for the rest of the bout.
“J.P. is looking good,” Weiss said. “I’m really pleased with [everyone’s] training. I just think they can do anything they want to [in the postseason].”
O’Connor concluded the year at 26-0 with his 15th dual win. Still, the top-ranked grappler saved praise for his co-captain, who also extended a hefty winning streak. Caputo earned a 5-0 win over No. 16 Steve Bosak, his second in as many weeks against a highly-touted opponent.
“Louis had a big win doing what he usually does,” O’Connor said. “And he did so in convincing fashion. It wasn’t even a close match.”
Despite a scoreless opening period, Caputo took off in the second. The senior started on bottom, but managed a reversal and showed his strength in the top position. After holding Bosak scoreless in the second, Caputo notched a takedown early in the final frame to widen his lead. With his 17th win of the season, the co-captain pushed his unbeaten streak to 12 matches.
Unfortunately for the Crimson, none of its other competitors could keep pace. With the dual season closing on a sour note, O’Connor expressed some frustration at the toll that injuries took on Harvard.
“It’s kind of been a trend since I’ve been here,” said O’Connor about the number of sidelined grapplers. “We just don’t have the depth that other schools have. We need a little more backing—by which I mean admissions backing—to be a competitive program in the dual season.”
COLUMBIA 30, HARVARD 15
The Crimson was more competitive in New York, winning three bouts and dropping two others by slim margins, but the Lions (8-10-1, 2-3) emerged victorious after a strong showing in the smaller weight classes. Kyle Gilchrist (125) handed freshman Steven Keith a rare loss, edging the rookie, 4-3. Columbia followed with a fall and technical fall in the next two bouts, putting Harvard on its heels. But the Crimson responded and nearly salvaged the match with consecutive wins from rookie Paul Liguori (149) and O’Connor. Liguori built a 7-2 lead early on and held on for the 9-8 decision. O’Connor, meanwhile, had little trouble dispatching the Lions’ Jake O’Hara with a fall in 2:52.
With the team score at 14-9, Harvard had legitimate hopes of a comeback.
“The match against Columbia was a typical one,” Weiss said. “It could have gone either way.”
But, in the end, it was not the Crimson’s day, as the Lions rattled off four wins in the remaining five bouts, conceding only a forfeit to Caputo. Other than sophomore heavyweight Spencer Desena, who came up short in a 6-3 decision, none of the contests were closer than 10 points.
Yet following the difficulties of league competition, Weiss showed excitement for the transition to individual work, as his co-captains lead the charge into the postseason.
“Now that guys are done [with team matches] they can make a big jump,” the coach said. “Right now is an exciting time for Harvard wrestling. We have two shots at a national title.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard ended its team season on a high note, finishing fifth in the College Squash Association Team Championships this past weekend, as co-captain Colin West won his last three matches for the Crimson squad.
Harvard lost in the quarterfinal round in New Haven, Conn. to Princeton (11-4) on Friday, but rebounded to defeat Western Ontario on Saturday and Cornell (10-6) yesterday. The Crimson finished the team season 7-5 overall, with West leading the squad with an 11-1 record.
“We were seeded fifth and finished fifth, so we played as we were expected to play,” co-captain Frank Cohen said. “We played really well against Cornell, and we were happy with the way the tournament ended.”
“I think how the team played this weekend summed up the season,” Harvard coach Satinder Bajwa said. “We lost to the four teams that were better than us, and they couldn’t beat those teams—any team that was even or slightly better on paper. The boys came out and maximized their potential. It speaks highly of their courage and character.”
HARVARD 7, CORNELL 2
Harvard defeated a tough opponent to win its third match of the weekend. The Crimson bested its Ivy competitor, 7-2, with co-captains West and Cohen leading the team to victory.
West, playing in the No. 1 slot, easily defeated his opponent in straight sets, but Cohen had to dig deeper and pull out the win in a decisive fifth game. Juniors Richard Hill and J. Reed Endresen both pulled off gritty five-set wins as well.
“We had a tight match back in December with Cornell,” Bajwa said. “We knew we were going to have some tough matches this time, but the guys went out and fought.”
HARVARD 7, WESTERN ONTARIO 2
A day after losing to Princeton, Harvard rebounded in the consolation match to defeat No. 8 Western Ontario on Saturday.
The team, following on the heels of West, had four straight-set wins. West did not have any trouble against his opponent, as he defeated Brian Wong, 11-1, 11-5, 11-6.
The pattern continued with freshman Jason Michas edging Yeshale Chetty by a score of 14-12 in the third set and sophomore William Ahmed taking care of Tashlin Reddy, 12-10, 12-10, 11-5, in the No. 5 and 8 positions, respectively.
“They regrouped and focused, and they had to believe they could get the win, and that’s what they did,” Bajwa said.
Freshman Alexander Ma finished off the day defeating Rafik Bhaloo, 11-4, 11-7, 11-7. Harvard also clinched close five-set wins from Endresen and Cohen.
PRINCETON 8, HARVARD 1
West won his first matchup of the tournament against Princeton’s No. 1 on Friday, but the Crimson could not capitalize on that momentum, as it lost the next eight matches to the Tigers.
West narrowly defeated his opponent, Todd Harrity, taking the match to a fifth game. West won the first two games, 11-9 and 11-4, but Harrity tied up the match, taking the next two by the same score. West managed to pull out the victory for his team in the decider, beating his opponent, 11-4.
In four of its matches, Harvard managed to take the lead by winning the first set, but it eventually fell in four games. Crimson freshman Zeke Scherl took the first game, 11-9, but dropped the next three to lose the match. Junior Eliot Buchanan, Ahmed, and Ma were also bested in a similar fashion.
“We thought on the day we had a chance to beat them,” West said. “We felt a little flat and a bit lackluster. We wanted a shining performance, and we had the opportunity to do something big, but we fell short.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Although back in Cambridge its male counterpart was struggling against a gritty Cornell lineup, the Harvard women’s basketball team had no trouble disposing of a young Big Red squad.
The Crimson (15-7, 6-2 Ivy) visited Cornell (5-17, 1-8) Friday night in the second leg of their seasonal matchup. In Cambridge two weeks ago, the Big Red was only able to put up 53 points, and the outcome was no different at Newman Arena. The Crimson’s defense held Cornell to the same number of points, but this time around—led by freshman Victoria Lippert’s 20-point game—Harvard extended its winning margin by five for a final score of 74-53.
“I was pleased,” said Harvard coach Kathy Delaney-Smith. “The team weathered some runs of momentum by Cornell. Cornell is not one of those teams that are in the race. They have nice young players, but they have nothing to lose, so they played without pressure. We started strong and Cornell made a couple of runs, but they were never closer than nine.”
Delaney-Smith’s analysis of the game captures the gist of the Crimson’s first game in the Empire State.
Junior co-captain Christine Matera nailed a jumper a minute into the game to start the barrage of scoring. Harvard tallied 13 straight points to open the game, and the defense took care of leaving Cornell scoreless for the first seven minutes of the contest.
The Big Red was slowly chipping away at the deficit, but with 11:02 left in the half, the Crimson distanced itself on the scoreboard with a layup by freshman Miriam Rutzen and a shot from long range by sophomore Brogan Berry, extending the margin to 22-7.
Cornell was not deterred and kept insisting on a comeback. A three-pointer by the Big Red’s Lauren Benson made the score 26-17 with seven minutes left before the break.
Unfortunately for Cornell, that would be the closest it would come in the first half. A series of turnovers by the Big Red, big rebounds by the Crimson, and steals by Matera and Lippert ensured that Harvard would keep a double-digit lead entering halftime. Sophomore Caitlin Rowland scored a trey to procure the Crimson’s biggest lead of the half, 35-19. Harvard would end the half with a 40-28 advantage.
“[Cornell] rebounded the ball well, but we beat them there by double digits and that is something that we’re always trying to focus on,” Matera said. “However, we started out well defensively, and that was key for us.”
On the boards, the Crimson outrebounded the Big Red throughout the game, particularly in the first half. Harvard went to the locker room with 25 rebounds and finished the game with 48, while Cornell could only come up 16 in the first and 33 boards on the night.
Big contributors to these totals were junior Jackie Alemany and Lippert. Apart from leading the team in scoring, Lippert also had 10 rebounds, and Alemany flirted with a double-double, posting nine points and 10 rebounds.
“Jackie had a great game with the offensive and defensive rebounding,” Delaney-Smith said. “Everyone did a great job on the boards. I was pleased with the changes we made to the defense, and everybody did a great job adjusting.”
Alemany’s three-point shot in the second half with 11:06 to go gave the Crimson a 17-point lead. But the Big Red wanted one more opportunity to make it a close game, and it got that shot, thanks to an 8-0 run with seven minutes to play.
Harvard didn’t let Cornell’s last surge cause any distress, and the Crimson answered back with a nine-point run of its own, essentially sealing the deal with 4:39 left on the clock.
Missed jumpers by Lippert led to some charity points for Cornell, but fouls in the waning moments of the game led to two free throws and a three-point play by junior co-captain Claire Wheeler.
“We changed our defense to put together three or four stops late in the game,” Delaney-Smith said. “Our transition game was outstanding [Friday] night. The change in our transition game put the momentum back on our side.”

Yet another celebrity will be visiting campus as an honoree of the year, joining the ranks of Justin Timberlake and Wyclef Jean. This time, it's Jeff Garlin, who's been selected as the first Immediate Gratification Player of the Year.
Best known as Larry David’s manager Jeff Greene on HBO’s "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Garlin will be attending an IGP improv show on Saturday, Mar. 6, at 11:30 p.m. to perform a guest monologue and to receive his award.
In addition to executive producing and co-starring in "Curb Your Enthusiasm," Garlin was the voice actor for the spaceship captain in "WALL-E." He began his career in improvisation, performing with Second City in Chicago, a group whose illustrious alums include Tina Fey and Rachel Dratch.
Instead of a medal or trophy, Garlin will be fortunate enough to receive his very own red-and-yellow necktie, an IGP hallmark.
Garlin is the first to receive this honor, but IGP czar Scott A. Levin-Gesundheit ’11 said he hopes the troupe will give many more awards in the coming years.
“We’re hoping to give this award as much as possible, devaluing it to the point where it basically means nothing,” Levin-Gesundheit said.

You would think that it’s pretty hard not to notice a Red Line train.  You would also think it’s not a good idea to drive into one.  Apparently, Jefferson Mondesir, a 30-year-old resident of Everett, disagrees with us on both counts.
Mondesir crashed through a metal fence and drove his 1994 Ford van straight into two cars of a Red Line train in Cambridge shortly after midnight on Friday.  The incident occurred between the Charles/MGH and Kendall T stops.
No one was injured in the accident, and MBTA crews repaired the damaged tracks in time for regular T service to resume by 5 a.m.
Mondesir wasn’t so lucky. He’s been charged with the crimes of driving under the influence, failure to drive in marked lanes, reckless operation, and failure to yield or stop.
Perhaps this is why subways are normally underground?

Correction: Feb. 22, 2010
An earlier version of this post stated incorrectly that four Harvard alums are playing on the Canadian and American women's hockey teams this year. In fact, there are five Harvard women's hockey alums participating in the Olympic games.
