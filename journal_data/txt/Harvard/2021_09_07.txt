After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
At first glance, “Trese” checks all the boxes for a quintessential action-adventure animated show — vibrant characters, explosive combat, and a dash of vengeance. But as the six-episode series progresses, it becomes clear that the show is about much more than macabre battles and neatly intersecting subplots.
Based on the beloved Filipino comic of the same name, “Trese” makes history as the first Filipino animated series to stream on Netflix. The story opens as the fragile harmony between humanity and the occult starts to fray, leaving Manila on the verge of domination by dark forces. The city’s aswang (an encompassing term for supernatural beings from Phillippine folklore), chafed by restriction, begin to turn their backs on the babaylan (Phillippine shamans) with the titular surname Trese — a lineage of humans tasked with intermediating conflict between the human and spirit worlds.
With a dynamic Manila as its canvas, the show explores the age-old question of whether genuine social and political harmony between diverse peoples is possible, as well as the ways in which forces like tribalism and xenophobia challenge the realization of such a world. Despite occasional gaps in its otherwise seamless plot and a regrettably rushed climax, “Trese” delivers a mature, richly imagined exploration of the capacity for coexistence in a world where every person — and every spirit — wants their own share.
The series revolves around Alexandra Trese, a resolute young woman who, as the sixth child of the sixth child, has inherited unique magical powers from her babaylan family. Voiced in English and Filipino by Shay Mitchell and Liza Soberano, respectively, the titular protagonist helps city police solve haunted crimes while grappling with her family’s fraught past. As she contends with creatures including tikbalang (a half human, half horse), duwende (dwarf-like creatures who dwell in the earth), and aswang, Alexandra fights to prove she is as skilled a babaylan as her respected father Anton (Carlos Alazraqui and Eugene Adalia). Her struggle to trust in her own capabilities in times of crisis lends plentiful emotional fodder to a show marked by action and gore.
The believability and allure of any good animated show rests on the groundwork of its worldbuilding. Despite the sweeping diversity of its cast, the environment of “Trese” is delightfully cohesive. The show’s characters are tied together in a complex web of mutuality — each of them battle for supremacy while remaining acutely aware of their interdependence, particularly in the face of powerful foes. The worldbuilding of “Trese” is strong not just in its seamless incorporation of magic within an urban landscape, but also in its evocation of a rich political ecosystem — one riddled with the gridlock and tribalism endemic in real-world government.
Another welcome element of “Trese” is its nuanced treatment of gender in Alexandra’s struggles for power and self-actualization. Budjette Tan, the original comic’s author, has expressed in interviews with Filipino news channels and the Netflix docuseries “Trese After Dark” that he and illustrator Kajo Baldisimo originally planned to make Alexandra a man but, after reflecting on the excess of strong male characters in media, decided to change the protagonist to a young woman.
Alexandra’s womanhood is explored with nuance and care, particularly through her complex relationship with her father. Older aswang frequently weigh the protagonist’s powers against Anton’s. One comments, “It’s over, Alexandra. Your father isn’t here to protect you.”
Her response comes two episodes later: “He’s not here. I’m all we’ve got.” It’s refreshing to watch Alexandra, a young woman, helm detective investigations in the company of supporting male characters — the wise yet bureaucratically constrained police chief Captain Guerrero (Matthew Yang King and Apollo Abraham); Anton’s old partner Hank Sparrow (Christopher Carlo Caling and Jon Jon Briones); and the half-deity brothers Crispin and Basilio (Griffin Puatu and Simon Dela Cruz) collectively called the Kambal, literally translating to “the twins.”
Despite its myriad delights, “Trese” nearly loses its balance as it surges toward the culminating confrontation in its sixth episode. While each episode presents its own isolated mystery, there are a host of recurring characters, many of whom cryptically warn Alexandra that “There is a storm coming.” The sixth episode attempts to bring these disparate threads together, pitting Alexandra and her allies against a powerful ancient foe once restrained by Anton through magic. In an attempt to tie everything neatly together, the final moments of “Trese” overwhelm viewers with rushed backstories. The storylines of certain minor characters — such as the faceless envoy of the goddess of death Trese periodically encounters – are, though intriguing, another element of the plot left frustratingly unresolved.
Though Netflix has yet to announce whether “Trese” will be returning to the small screen for a second season, lingering questions from Alexandra’s past — one of the most striking being the possibility of an undead twin — and the introduction of a hair-raising, mummified new foe in the final moments of the last episode hint that the first season of the Filipino show is poised to spill over into a second. For now, viewers from across the world can revel in the first iteration of this groundbreaking series, one that fuses contemporary challenges with the lore of the past.

Following its premiere at the 2020 Shanghai International Film Festival, the animated adventure “Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop” was released in Japanese theaters and Netflix on July 22. The teen dramedy follows two high schoolers — shy haiku poet Cherry (voiced by Ichikawa Somegorō VIII) and popular social media influencer Smile (Hana Sugisaki) — who meet on a summer day. In a genre as saturated as the film’s neon-heavy color scheme, Kyōhei Ishiguro’s cinematic directorial debut makes a splash not just with its bright palette but also with its reinterpretations of romance tropes.
Ishiguro employs many recurring visual elements that verge on the surreal, from endless acres of fluorescent green farmland to perfectly inert clouds with unusually sharp outlines. These intricate landscapes contain many of the specific details in Cherry’s rich haikus on the four seasons, reinforcing and bringing to life his writing in luscious detail. The interrelatedness of the visual and verbal poetry brings home Ishiguro’s earnest message on art’s ability to reveal new ways of seeing the world.
Slow-motion shots and subtly glowing lighting heighten the drama of Cherry’s meet-cute with Smile, nodding to timeworn depictions of first encounters. As their friendship progresses, Cherry’s haiku effectively function as both visual motif and narrative device, punctuating the story’s otherwise fluid cadence with signposts of his personal growth. Introducing scenes that at first appear to conform to clichés and then enriching them in light of the central duo’s pastimes enables the film to contemplate deeper questions about art’s role in our lives while retaining its lighthearted charm.
At times, Ishiguro evokes his past work. The search for a lost vinyl record that occupies much of the film’s second half becomes a bittersweet representation of the links between music and memory — a theme “Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop” shares with “Your Lie in April,” the first TV series Ishiguro directed. The central duo’s impending separation, while far from a novel source of conflict in teen love stories, allows for inventive and nuanced comparisons: Symbols of summer’s end, like the formal brevity of a haiku or the fleeting seconds captured on livestream, accumulate with increasing urgency as the days pass. The film continually layers portrayals of creativity from the past and present, reminding viewers that art can preserve memories in vivid detail at the same time as it attests to their impermanence.
Uncertainty about the future builds throughout the film like bubbles in a shaken soda can: The intense emotion so evident in Cherry’s poems and Smile’s videos belies their struggles to communicate openly with one another, which their imagination eventually helps them overcome. A concluding musical moment releases all the stored tension in an outpouring of sweet, but never saccharine, affection. Singer-songwriter Taeko Onuki’s airy acoustic ballad “Yamazakura” stands in heartfelt contrast to the largely electronic score, narrating a chance meeting that leads to love as the very events it describes unfold onscreen in time to the beat — uniting music, poetry, and film in a final celebration of expressing feelings through art in any form. One of the plot’s most prominent messages lies in its refusal to needlessly elevate either art or love as a vessel for unattainable ideals: By rejoicing in the everyday, “Words Bubble Up Like Soda Pop” attains all the iconic effervescence of its namesake drink.

One year and eight months after their last release, the five queens of Red Velvet marked their return with their latest enchanting EP “Queendom.” For those who are not active K-pop listeners, waiting 20 months for new music may seem like nothing. But in the fast-paced K-pop world, where groups release new albums two to three times a year, 20 months is a very long time.
The announcement of Red Velvet’s comeback, featuring all five members, resulted in both flutters of excitement and sighs of relief for the group’s fans, also known as “ReVeluvs.” Red Velvet’s last release, the album “The ReVe Festival: Finale,” featured what was arguably the best K-pop song of 2019: “Psycho.” However, promotion of “Psycho” was cut short when main vocalist Wendy suffered a serious injury while rehearsing for SBS’s Gayo Daejun event. ReVeluvs have waited with bittersweet anticipation since then for the next Red Velvet album.
Unfortunately, “Queendom” falls short of meeting the high expectations set by “The ReVe Festival: Finale.” This does not mean that the album is bad, but rather that it is just safe. This predictability differs greatly from Red Velvet’s previous output as a revolutionary and experimental group who have never been afraid to push past musical boundaries and create their own genre of K-pop. Their name represents the duality of their musical style: “Red” represents bold, addictive pop, funk, and hip-hop, while “Velvet” evokes their sensual, smooth R&B, jazz, and balladic tracks.
The title track “Queendom” is an empowering dance-pop song that features many of Red Velvet’s “Red” trademarks like bright vocals, electronic sounds, and fast-paced, driving beats. But the group stays too true to the predictable boundaries of dance-pop, and the song lacks an additional level of musical depth and even unorthodoxy that would make it truly theirs, which their previous single “Zimzalabim” exemplifies.
The song’s theme of empowerment is successful but also ambitious at times. The more gender-inclusive lyric choice of “‘Cause we are queens and kings” may not seem remarkable, but in the world of K-pop, where many songs are strictly gendered, it’s a step in the right direction. At the same time, though, the song struggles to balance the “Red Velvet” sound with its lyrical message. A trademark of Red Velvet’s “Red” songs lies in their hooks, and the repetitive “Ladida-do ba-badida” throughout “Queendom,” while catchy, lacks lyrical meaning and ultimately detracts from more impactful lyrics like “Don’t need crown, we were born to dazzle.”
However, the message of empowerment is better, albeit more subtly, communicated through the album’s chic second song “Pose.” Relative to “Queendom,” this song more effectively uses pop elements, utilizing a rhythmic, spoken-word-like vocal quality to make listeners feel like models on a runway with all the confidence in the world to strut and pose. In fact, the repetition of the lyric “pose” adds to, rather than detracting from, the main lyrics like “Don't care about other people's stares / (That's right, strike a pose, then go) / Meet the real me, yeah.” “Pose” is a must-add song to any runway performances, whether in New York Fashion Week or your own bedroom.
“Knock on Wood” is another well-crafted, clever song that captures the essence of the group. Through its light instrumental and feathery vocals, the song nimbly channels the experience of falling in love and the nerves of a first crush. The third and fourth songs, “Better Be” and “Pushin’ N’ Pullin’,” tap into the “Velvet” R&B side of Red Velvet’s sound with varying levels of success. While “Better Be” is not a standout, “Pushin’ N’ Pullin’” paints a musical visual of love’s push and pull through emotional vocals and shimmering instrumentals.
The sixth and final song, “Hello, Sunset,” is the perfect song for late-night summer drives. Its soft piano instrumentals paint the perfect background for Red Velvet’s whimsical, gorgeous vocals. The lyrics discuss saying goodbye to summer but, more importantly, saying hello to the future. One particular line has stuck out for ReVeluvs: “Thank you for waiting for me / I'll give you a big hug.”
When asked what she wanted fans to take away from this album, Red Velvet’s leader Irene responded, “When we’re together, we shine more beautifully so let’s be there for each other forever and always.” After overcoming obstacles together, the group is embracing a new chapter with this album. Although “Queendom” may not feature the experimentation and creativity that marked Red Velvet’s past work, it still has sparks of what makes the group unique and promises more to come from these five queens of K-pop.

Netflix’s new series “Shadow and Bone” is a masterclass in adapting a young adult fantasy book series. With smart characters and a fast-pace, creative plot, it manages to be faithful to its source material while also telling a great story in its own right.
“Shadow and Bone” follows young cartographer Alina (Jessie Mei Li) as she discovers that she has unique abilities that could save her country from a dangerous threat and prevent a civil war. As her story unfolds, “Shadow and Bone” also follows a crew of lovable rogues — the “Crows”— who are desperate for a massive reward they can only get by kidnapping Alina.
While “Shadow and Bone” is a faithful adaptation, the show’s creators also made plenty of changes. It weaves together storylines from multiple book series by Leigh Bardugo, who also acts as an executive producer for the show — Alina Starkov’s side of the plot is based on the “Shadow and Bone” trilogy, while Crow Kaz Brekker’s (Freddy Carter) side acts as a prequel to the “Six of Crows” duology. While this is an unusual way to adapt two separate, self-contained series set in the same universe, it works. The half of the show centred on Alina has a plot that mainly adheres to its source material, while the half focusing on the Crows features new content, but thankfully in this case it is not to the detriment of the series. This change means the protagonist and deuteragonists are at odds without either group being cast as true villains, creating a great moral quandary for audiences deciding who to root for. It’s a difficult line to walk that may feel disjointed or forced at moments, but overall the show successfully interweaves both narratives.
As a protagonist, Aline often comes across as whiny in the books, but “Shadow and Bone” makes her more headstrong and stubborn, and the flashbacks to her childhood paired with narration of her letters to Mal (Archie Renaux) make her headspace and motivations clear and sympathetic. Moreover, her love triangle with Mal and General Kirigan (Ben Barnes) is well executed and engaging: Alina is torn between the childhood friend she has loved for all her life and the dangerous general who could unlock her potential, and the actors play off each other to make it tense and enjoyable to watch. Despite containing all the standard elements of the “teen girl discovers her powers, enters new world, and is stuck between two boys,” cliche, it uses the tropes as a launching pad to consider abusive relationships, fear, self-worth and self-actualization.
Despite the Crows’ half of the story not being directly drawn from the books that inspired their characters, the adaptation captures everything “Six of Crows” is about, painting a picture of wily teenage crooks who intend to outwit and outlast everyone who has wronged or underestimated them. While disconnected at times, the change allows many characters to shine. For example, it allows Matthias (Calahan Skogman) and Nina’s (Danielle Galligan) backstories to be told in real-time instead of flashback, and their chemistry is electric. Moreover, the other three crows have a fabulous dynamic: Jesper’s (Kit Young) comedic relief, Kaz’s ruthlessness[,] and Inej’s (Amita Suman) faith and resilience define a crew who are at odds despite their camaraderie and are forced to grow because of it. They also have some of the best action sequences in the show, with heists and scams that unfold in twisty and surprising ways.
However, since the show doesn’t waste time explaining its complicated geography or magical systems in depth, some choices come off as clumsy. For example, nearly every character, from minor to major, makes some kind of racist comment towards Alina because she is half-Shu (coding for East Asian) — this intense focus is strange since Jesper, who is Zemeni (coded as Black), and Inej, who is Suli (coded as South Asian), both face almost no prejudice or discrimination. It’s particularly odd since Alina’s race is ambiguous in the books, but in “Six of Crows” Inej describes the racism she faced growing up in her native country. While this subplot could do with a bit more nuance, it does raise some important questions about whether Alina should live her life in service of people who openly discriminate against her because of her heritage.
In other aspects, “Shadow and Bone” does employ subtlety with more success. Small, important moments like Matthias looking mournfully at a taxidermied wolf, Kaz always wearing his gloves, and Mal’s ability to find the stag lend the fantasy world a richness while also foreshadowing backstories and plot developments that could be utilized in Season Two.
Additionally, there’s an amazing attention to detail displayed in the show’s production. The CGI is incredibly slick and stylized for a Netflix show, paired with consistently fun cinematography — for example, shots of Kaz always begin by focusing on his cane, before widening to include him. The Grishas’ keftas and the Crows’ distinctive outfits are beautifully made by costume designer Wendy Partridge, and the sets are all easily differentiable, from bustling Ketterdam to opulent Ravka to frigid Fjerda. Additionally, the show isn’t afraid of making the characters look dirty and roughed up — after the soldiers have been in tough conditions in harsh weather, “Shadow and Bone” avoids the common tendency to show main characters looking immaculate surrounded by dishevelled, grimy extras.
“Shadow and Bone” is the kind of work every adaptation aspires to be: It’s fun, creative and smart, both honoring the source material and creating a narrative that’s all its own. Hopefully, these eight episodes are only the beginning of a complex and immersive fantasy series based on Bardugo’s books.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
“This is where I write an op-ed calling Harvard a colonizer,” I texted two of my friends in the Harvard Philippine Forum. It was mid-August, and one of the friends had just reported that her emails to petition for the addition of a language tutorial in Tagalog — the most spoken language in the Philippines, as well as the native tongue of my mother’s family — had been “thoroughly ghosted.”
The colonizer joke wasn’t new. It started when I was seriously considering applying to Harvard in my junior year of high school and noted the absence of Tagalog in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences course offerings. At the time, this was more an annoyance than anything, molded perfectly to complement my shame about being a “bad” Filipina for my inability to speak the language.
But I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something larger at play.
What about the fact that Tagalog is the fourth most-spoken primary language in the United States, following only English, Spanish, and Chinese? What about the outsized frontline role of Filipino American nurses during the pandemic? And what about the c-word itself — the colonial state which the United States operated in the Philippines for half a century, fighting a brutal war to suppress insurrection, and ultimately reforming the archipelago in its own image? Did none of these merit institutional acknowledgment? Was I overreacting for believing that they did?
The negative space of the FAS language offerings and my self-doubt in acknowledging its severity embody what the poet and essayist Cathy Park Hong calls minor feelings: “the racialized range of emotions that are negative, dysphoric, and therefore untelegenic.” Minor feelings involve a sensation of lack — a blank course offerings webpage, an unanswered series of emails — and the awareness that this lack is socially constructed, building resentment towards those responsible for its construction. They’re characteristic of the Asian American experience, where the model minority myth and survival mentality of immigration operate in tandem to swallow any discontent into silence.
I knew intrinsically that something was wrong with this situation: I knew it was unacceptable that Harvard does not teach a language with numerically significant daily usage while clearly possessing the resources to teach ones that were functionally dead, like Latin, or that the history of a country which built the U.S. empire is almost entirely overlooked in the course catalog. And I knew how this lack intersected with my experience of history: the erasure of Filipino traditions under the hegemony of American “soft power” abroad, the origin myth of the United States as an anticolonial underdog obfuscating a tangible history of overseas empire, the psychological scars of self-denial that colonization leaves behind.
But true to the definition of minor feelings, I could not point my finger at their source without bracing for my lived reality to be dismissed. I had no evidence of an administrator who rejected course offerings on the Philippines and verbally cited an investment in American empire as the reason; thus, my feelings were minor and not valid. Minor feelings were starting this op-ed four separate times since March and each time convincing myself that I had nothing to say, the unused words slowly fermenting to leave a bitter taste in my throat.
But here’s the thing about minor feelings — they only grow. And at some point, they’re not so minor anymore.
In March of this year, following the horrific shooting of six Asian women at an Atlanta spa, two Harvard deans and the University’s President sent emails promising to “stand with” the University’s Asian American students, faculty, and staff. But Harvard’s words were just words. In the Age of the Internet, where provocation is monetized, we have falsely come to equate speaking with action. We are more concerned with seeming political than being so. Void of deliverables, those slippery platitudes melted away in the same way that the parade of aesthetically pleasing hashtags and the passion of Instagram-story infographic warriors did a week later: into a conspicuous and familiar silence. It was an institutional lack so great, so impossible to excuse, that the minor feelings exploded, soured and stinging, past the point of containment.
The absence of any conversation on Tagalog, I realized then, was not a personal shortcoming. It was preordained; it occurred within Harvard by design.
The question of course offerings on Tagalog and the Philippines — or, more accurately, the lack thereof — is not whether Harvard has a duty to help its minority “ethnic” students learn about their own culture. It’s about what institutional silences signal about our reckoning with national history and complicity in the narratives that maintain oppression, a conversation that implicates us all.
Tongue-tied where it really matters, Harvard’s silence on deliverables speaks for itself. It tells a story of the questions which this institution, and America as a whole, are not ready to be asked or to answer. But this semester, alongside other members of the Filipino American community, I find that my own tongue is loosening, my throat cleared of the bitter, minor feelings that kept it blocked. And I’m ready for this conversation to begin.

Harvard’s vaccine mandate seems to be working. As of Monday afternoon, a full 93 percent of students and 95 percent of University employees were vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the University’s testing dashboard. If Harvard were its own independent nation, we would have the highest vaccination rate in the entire world.
Our campus has embraced the jab (or jabs, for our Moderna and Pfizer followers), and for good reason. Completing a vaccination series against Covid-19 is crucial in protecting our community against the ongoing pandemic. We continue, as before, to encourage everyone who can to get their shot as soon as possible. Doing so is a matter of public and social responsibility; it remains the easiest way to further the fight against a disease that has already claimed millions of lives worldwide. It’s also one of the easiest paths to a safe, fun, and productive in-person semester.
Yet we caution that our exceptionally high vaccination rates haven’t rendered our community a safe bubble — not entirely, anyway. Many still remain at risk; our epidemiological impact isn’t limited to our fellow, largely vaccinated, young peers. The faculty and staff who make campus life possible don’t exist exclusively within the confines of our university: They go home, after long lectures or exhausting dining hall shifts, to their families and loved ones, to a comparatively under-vaccinated, under-protected reality. Minimizing the number of unvaccinated affiliates is the easiest way to limit on-campus spread and accidental exposure, protecting those who are only one degree of separation away.
Of course, not everyone is fully vaccinated and, given realities like medical exemptions, it’s unlikely everyone will be. The question then is what to do with those who aren’t. What are the duties of the unprotected amongst us?
Luckily, our administration has answered that question for us. Harvard has issued specific guidelines for these students. They must, for example, wear a mask outside if distancing is not possible and are encouraged to distance even indoors with a mask on. We urge our peers to respect these measures.
Those who have received the vaccine have taken a crucial step towards protecting themselves and their community; the unvaccinated — whether unable or unwilling to take this step — must be hypervigilant in following public health guidance. We do not wear our vaccination statuses like scarlet letters, so it is incumbent on the unvaccinated to take it upon themselves to protect those around them.
That being said, it is now very clear that the vaccinated can also become infected with and spread Covid-19, despite the all-important jab. We need Harvard to complement its vaccine mandate with clear procedures that will support and care for students should they, despite their best efforts, become infected. Doing so would help dispel student worries, demystifying the threat of infection and offering much-needed emotional relief to those who, after their jabs, are still concerned about a positive test result.

This past year’s concoction of “The Queen’s Gambit” and quarantine boredom inspired me, along with millions of others, to dust off old chess sets or play online. It also led me to “Mind Master,” a memoir by former World Chess Champion Vishy Anand.
Through his memoir, Vishy brings us into the dynamic world of competitive chess. He colors the pages with rare stories from a lifetime of triumph and defeat, learning and unlearning, sportsmanship and gamesmanship. His integrity, humility, and wholehearted humanity emanates from his prose. It’s no wonder he’s so beloved in the chess world.
Modern chess can trace its roots back nearly 500 years, and its predecessors even further. In the generation of Fortnite and League of Legends, it’s remarkable that this grandparent of board games has held its own for so long and remained a fixture on household shelves. Reading Vishy’s memoir cast new light on this old game, and reminded me that the meaning of chess has always extended much further than the pieces on the 64 checkered squares. In chess and in life, we can find new meaning in the old.
The chessboard was a battlefront of the Cold War. Much like the “Space Race” pitted America and the Soviet Union against one another in space exploration and the “Miracle on Ice” represented the rivalry in the hockey rink — the chessboard was a place where the nations could launch attacks, build fortresses, and employ strategies and tactics.
But as the Cold War culminated in a stalemate of sorts, a new war was brewing. Computer chess engines were approaching the level of top humans. In 1997, IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer contested a series of highly publicized matches against the then World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov. And it won, marking the first victory of a computer over a reigning World Champion. Ever since, chess engines have drastically outpaced top competitive players.
So, chess has been a simulacrum for American versus Soviet rivalry, a proxy for man versus machine, and its latest incarnation has taken on a new significance.
Modernization is the new name of this old game. Today, chess personalities live stream their games on Twitch and upload analysis videos on YouTube. For many, ChessTV is the new ESPN. Corporate sponsorship is flourishing; some tournaments are even offering bitcoin as prize money.
Perhaps chess isn’t a battleground at all. In this age of incredible interconnectedness, of virtualized communication and socialization further catalyzed by the Covid-19 pandemic, chess has brought a lot of people together. The moment the king gets checkmated or the clock runs out, your opponent is no longer your adversary, but perhaps they are a friend, family member, or someone sitting thousands of miles away who, if only for a brief time, was your companion. The growth of chess media and content creation has had a similar uniting effect, creating fan bases and forging new communities all around the globe.
At Harvard, it’s so easy to feel like we are competing with one another. Indeed, in some curved classes, we do so by design, assessed not by our grasp of the course material but by our relative performance. Perhaps it’s resemblant of a mentality that got us admitted in the first place. I’ve certainly had this feeling, and it can sometimes be really hard to shake.
But in this campus community that we all build together, it’s the collaboration, not the competition that makes it all work. In the semester’s opening moments, we need no prompting to begin forging new friendships, engaging with new ideas, discovering new joys. We study together in the Cabot Science Library, innovate together at the new Science and Engineering Complex, and, yes, even play chess together just outside the Smith Campus Center. At this university, indeed the oldest in the nation, it’s these fresh connections that make up some of the most valuable aspects of our shared experience.
These are some things that Vishy’s memoir got me thinking about. But I read a lot of other memoirs during this past Covid year, and in this column, I’d like to share some of the lessons I’ve learned and emotions I’ve felt while reading them. Memoirs have a way of expressing what truly matters to us, in all its beauty and ugly. They are a window into another’s story and a mirror into our own.
In the aftermath of Zoom University, let’s savor writing this chapter in our memoir. And though we are barely a week into the semester, if we remain committed to finding new joy in the old, I know it will be beautiful.
William Y. Yao '22, a former Technology Chair, is an Applied Math concentrator in Kirkland House. His column "A Memoir Of Our Own" appears on alternate Tuesdays.

Harvard University Information Technology implemented a software patch on Monday to address the cause of widespread internet outages that affected students across campus last week.
The WiFi issues — which began on Tuesday and continued through Thursday — coincided with the start of classes on Wednesday, forcing some students to rely on wireless hotspots to attend virtual courses and submit online assignments.
In an email to students on Thursday, HUIT wrote that a vendor software issue had caused the outages, which were also affecting other institutions of higher education. HUIT stabilized the network later on Thursday, per HUIT spokesperson Tim Bailey.
The vendor, Aruba Networks, wrote in a statement last week that it was “aware” of the issue and had been in contact with its customers to detail the “mitigating steps to address the issue.”
“As this is a high priority matter, our global engineering teams are actively working with impacted customers to provide the necessary support to resolve the issue as quickly as possible,” the statement read.
HUIT and Aruba worked over the weekend to find a long-term solution to the network interruptions and on Monday implemented a software fix to address the issue’s root cause, Bailey wrote. They will continue to monitor the network and post updates online.
Stephanie N. Yoshida ’25, who had persistent issues connecting to WiFi from her room in The Inn, said on Thursday that she hopes for more transparency in future outages.
“We receive the emails, but I feel like it’s after the problem has been addressed, in my opinion,” Yoshida said. “The process can be a little faster, and then I hope there's more information about it.”
Amanda R. Stetz ’22 — who is taking a course that is virtual for the first few weeks — also advocated for increased communication from HUIT.
“Just being transparent about [the issues] would be super helpful,” Stetz said on Thursday.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Phillips Brooks House Association’s Student Labor Action Movement held a teach-in to mobilize undergraduate students to stand with unions on labor issues across campus Saturday on the steps of Memorial Church.
Members from the dining services employees union UNITE HERE Local 26, Harvard Graduate Students Union-United Automobile Workers, and Harvard Union of Clerical and Technical Workers spoke about their respective issues at the teach-in. All three unions are currently in contract negotiations with the University.
The teach-in took place one day after the graduate students union’s “Rally for Real Recourse” demanding third-party arbitration of cases of identity-based discrimination and harassment. SLAM organizer William M. Sutton ’23 began the teach-in, urging undergraduates to participate in the efforts of different unions across campus.
“What’s important right now is that [we] as undergraduates begin organizing, that we get to wake up to the importance of labor issues,” he said. “So that when the next time comes to send an email, attend the rally, or walk the picket line, we’re there shoulder-to-shoulder with the workers who make this campus run.”
SLAM introduced Local 26 members Hakim Akendar, a pantry steward at Winthrop, and Dee Ross-Burton to speak about the importance of preserving hours for employees.
“I believe we are a part of the community,” Akendar said. “I believe we should be able to provide for our family and have dignity.”
Local 26 initiated a flyer campaign as undergraduates moved into their dorms last month following the preliminary schedule changes shared by the University for the 2022-2023 academic year. The union had calculated the schedule changes would result in a 20 percent cut in the number of full-time residential house positions and an 8 percent cut in total hours for dining employees.
HGSU-UAW Bargaining Committee member Aparna Gopalan spoke about the graduate students union’s demands at the bargaining table, asking how many people in the audience have teaching fellows or assistants.
“Each and every one of you are critical to the strike effort, because you need to talk to your TFs and TAs and see how they’re doing,” she said. “Are they able to make rent? Are they getting harassed? Do they have protections against that?”
She urged undergraduate students to join the picket line with their teaching fellows and assistants.
In August, HGSU-UAW announced it would hold a strike authorization vote beginning Sept. 13 after five months at the bargaining table for its second contract with Harvard. The union and the University have not reached agreements on compensation, benefits, harassment and discrimination resolution processes, and union security.
Genevieve Butler, HUCTW member and Sociology faculty assistant, delivered a brief speech to the group at the end of the teach-in about efforts across unions to obtain residency for recipients of DACA and TPS.
“As a residential college, we feel like these are really important issues that affect our community,” she said.
Harvard spokesperson Jonathan L. Swain declined to comment on the statements made at the teach-in.
According to Sutton, the purpose of the teach-in was to inform undergraduate students about their “stake” in union-related issues on campus.
“We, as SLAM, like to follow what the workers want,” he said in an interview after the teach-in. “We never try to speak for them or do anything that would be at odds with their objectives as unions.”
Abrar J. Trabulsi ’23 said she came to the teach-in after seeing flyers around campus. In the event of a dining employees strike, she said, she would support them.
“A lot of them have dedicated 10, 20, 30, even 40 years of their lives to this place and to the students, and they deserve to be treated as human beings and treated with dignity,” she said.
Ezra H. Lebovitz ’23, a SLAM organizer, said students should be aware of the way Harvard’s employees help run many aspects of campus life that students often take for granted.
“I think that being cognizant of the ways that labor makes possible all of the functions and best parts of Harvard really transforms the way you approach your day-to-day and also allows you to support your fellow human beings and the people who are in and around your life,” he said.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Crimson Jam will be indefinitely postponed due to the increase of positive Covid-19 cases among College students, the Dean of Students Office announced Friday.
Crimson Jam — an annual concert and block party organized by the College Events Board — would have featured performances in Harvard Yard Friday night by student bands and headliner B.o.B.
DSO Assistant Dean Kate T. Colleran wrote in the announcement that the College cannot safely hold the event at this time.
“Given the increase in positive cases among Harvard College students and the newly announced implementation of a 3x a week testing requirement, we do not have the proper measures in place to hold a large-scale, congregate event until we can fully implement these new policy changes,” Colleran wrote.
Colleran added the College will reschedule the event for a future date if it is safe to do so.
The announcement stated that the Student Involvement Fair — which was also scheduled to take place on Friday — would proceed. The event, however, would require masks and extend throughout the entire Yard to reduce crowding.
The postponement came one day after Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair and Harvard University Health Services Director Giang T. Nguyen announced an increase in testing cadences. O’Dair and Nguyen also urged students to wear their masks and limit their interactions with others.
Pranay Varada ’25 said he was “sad to see it go” because it was intended to kick off the start of the school year, but he “wasn’t too surprised.”
“I can understand why the University decided to cancel it,” he said. “But it is sort of hard to comprehend, considering the other events that are still taking place.”
The Dean of Students Office did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Daniel K. Hasegawa ’22, a student singer and guitarist scheduled to open for B.o.B., rehearsed daily leading up to the event. He said he first heard about the decision from a representative of the production company hired by the CEB on Thursday morning.
After receiving the email, Hasegawa said he waited throughout the day for an official announcement. He said he was put in the “awkward position” of responding to questions from peers with “no public way for them to verify” the information.
“That was kind of an uncomfortable position to be in,” he said.
Hasegawa said he eventually received final confirmation of the postponement on Friday morning through Colleran’s email to the Harvard affiliates. He also heard back from the CEB, who explained they were in a “similar position of confusion,” per Hasegawa.
Isha Agarwal ’24, a member of the CEB, said postponing Crimson Jam so close to its scheduled time may have hurt the CEB’s relationships with vendors and performers.
“We pulled out the contract a day before the event, which is normally, obviously, not protocol when you sign a contract with someone,” Agarwal said. “If the event gets postponed and we’re able to have it at a later date, we won't be having B.o.B. again.”
Agarwal said she was also frustrated at the College indefinitely postponing a student organization-sponsored event but keeping the administration-sponsored Involvement Fair, adding that she believed the fair would have a higher turnout than Crimson Jam.
“I just wish they’d been a little bit more consistent in their messaging,” Agarwal added.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
This is Part I of our Freshman Survey series. Parts II, III, and IV will be released later this week, along with full data and visualizations.
After making it through the most competitive admissions cycle in Harvard College history, the Class of 2025 received more good news: Harvard was inviting incoming freshmen to campus in the fall along with the rest of the student body.
The College announced in May a full return to in-person learning and residential life this semester — for the first time since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020. To accommodate a record-high number of students accepted to the Class of 2024 who deferred their enrollment, the College is using Harvard-affiliated swing housing in 1201 Mass. Ave. and apartments on Prescott Street. Freshmen living in these accommodations are affiliated with the newly formed Maple Yard.
Still, the pandemic remains a reality of daily life at Harvard.
Students are required to receive the Covid-19 vaccine — unless falling under religious and medical exceptions — and are subject to an indoor mask mandate and regular viral testing. Even with those measures, Harvard increased testing requirements for undergraduates in response to a steep rise in cases after only three days of classes.
Though they are starting their college careers amid a pandemic that shows no sign of abating, in other ways the Class of 2025 is similar to classes that came before it.
The students are relatively wealthy compared to the general U.S. population and tend to hail from suburbs and the northeast U.S. Roughly 26 percent of members of the Class of 2025 who answered a question about parental income in The Crimson’s annual freshman survey said their families make $250,000 or more per year — earnings higher than 94 percent of American households.
Consistent with previous years, more student respondents identified as white than any other racial demographic. The Class of 2025 roughly matched last year’s all-time high for percentage of students who identify as Hispanic or Latinx and Black or African American.
As freshmen adjusted to their new lives at Harvard, roughly 78 percent of them responded to a Crimson email questionnaire about their backgrounds, beliefs, lifestyles, and experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. The anonymous survey explores topics ranging from political ideology to sexual experience to Covid-19’s impact on their mental health. Of 1,965 students comprising the Class of 2025, 1,537 freshmen responded. The Crimson did not account for potential selection bias in its analysis of the results. Due to rounding, reported statistics may not total exactly 100 percent.
The opening segment of The Crimson’s four-part introduction to the Class of 2025 examines the demographic profile of this year’s freshmen, considering factors like gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.
Demographics
In keeping with previous classes, this year’s freshmen are largely affluent, white, straight, and from the country’s coastal regions.
Among respondents to The Crimson’s survey, roughly 51.4 percent identified as female, 46.1 percent as male, and 1.8 percent as non-binary. Separately, approximately 0.7 percent identified as being transgender.
Of participants who answered a question about ethnicity, 53.1 percent identified as white, 23.6 percent as Asian, 15.7 percent as Black or African American, 13.4 percent as Hispanic or Latinx, 8.3 percent as South Asian, 0.9 percent as American Indian or Alaska Native, and 0.6 percent as Pacific Islander.
Roughly 71.1 percent of surveyed freshmen said they identify as straight, 12.5 percent as bisexual, 7.1 percent as gay or lesbian, and 2 percent as some other sexual identity. About 5.4 percent indicated that they are questioning their sexual orientation.
Of the students who do not identify as heterosexual, 60.5 percent said they have not yet come out.
As has been typical in past years, a plurality of surveyed members of the Class of 2025 hail from the coasts — 38.1 percent joining from the Northeast and 15.1 percent from the West. Meanwhile, 12.2 percent come from the Southeast, 11.4 percent from the Midwest, and only 6.2 percent from the southwestern states of Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.
Roughly 16.2 percent of respondents said they come from outside the U.S. and its territories, marking an increase from the 10.8 percent who reported international residency in the Class of 2024.
The number of students who reported coming from urban, suburban, and rural areas remained consistent with previous freshman classes. A majority of surveyed students — 56.7 percent — said they hail from suburbs, while just 9.4 percent share rural origins. Students coming from urban areas made up 33.9 percent of respondents.
Families & Finance
Almost half of respondents — 45.1 percent — reported that their parents make a combined annual income of more than $125,000 — nearly twice the median household income in the U.S.
Tuition for the 2021-2022 academic year totals $74,528, marking a 3 percent increase from the previous academic year. Roughly 54.8 percent of students reported receiving financial assistance from Harvard’s need-blind aid program, representing a slight drop from last year’s 57.5 percent.
Consistent with data from previous classes, students’ family wealth largely correlated with their ethnic background. Only 8.4 percent of white freshmen reported that the combined income of their parents was under $40,000 — the smallest fraction of any demographic. Students of color were significantly more likely to report a family income in that bracket: 29.4 percent of Hispanic or Latinx students, 19.5 percent of Black or African American students, and 13.5 percent of Asian students reported their parents make less than $40,000 annually.
The percentage of students reporting legacy status, defined as having one or more parents who attended Harvard College, rose slightly to 15.5 percent from 12.0 percent in last year’s freshman class.
Approximately 18.8 percent of surveyed white students reported legacy status, compared to 6.1 percent among African American or Black freshmen, 9.1 percent among Hispanic or Latinx students, and 15.1 percent among Asian students.
On average, legacy students reported a higher family income than that of their non-legacy classmates. Roughly 30.9 percent of legacy students reported a combined parental income of more than $500,000. Only 12.6 percent of non-legacy students said the same.
The percentage of freshmen who described themselves as first in their family to attend college also fell slightly to 20.0 percent from last year’s high of 22.8 percent.
Nearly 47 percent of Hispanic or Latinx students identified as first-generation college students, along with 24.7 percent of Black or African American students, 15.4 percent of Asian students, and 12 percent of white students.
First-generation students reported lower family incomes than their classmates. Approximately 8.2 percent of first-generation students reported a family income of more than $125,000. In contrast, more than two-thirds — 70.6 percent — reported a combined parental income below $80,000.
An overwhelming majority — 90.7 percent — of first-generation students receive some form of financial aid from Harvard.
The Path to Harvard
Members of the Class of 2025 who secured their place at Harvard College this year overcame a historically competitive admissions cycle, which saw a record-high number of applicants. 
This year, the College’s acceptance rate — 3.43 percent — dropped below the previous record-low 4.50 percent of applicants admitted to the Class of 2023. A record-high 57,435 applicants vied for a spot at the College this year, exceeding the previous record of 43,330 individuals who applied to the Class of 2023. The influx of applications forced the Admissions Office to postpone its decision release date.
Adding to the list of firsts, a record-high 85 percent of admits accepted their offers of admission to the College this year, surpassing the previous record held by the Class of 2021 by 1 percentage point. They join more than 340 Class of 2024 admits who deferred to the Class of 2025 last year — a significantly larger number of deferrals than in typical years. Combined, this year’s freshman class totals a historic 1,965 students.
Harvard was the top-choice college for an overwhelming majority — 78.8 percent — of surveyed freshmen.
One-fifth of respondents reported receiving help from a privately hired counselor while preparing college applications, consistent with previous years. Of these students, 48.9 percent of those who disclosed their parents’ financial status reported a combined family income of $250,000 or more; 9.8 percent reported a parental income of less than $40,000.
Nearly 60 percent of surveyed freshmen attended a non-charter public high school, 37.1 percent went to a private school, and 0.3 percent reported being homeschooled.
About 66 percent of respondents attended secondary schools that calculated class rank. Of these students, 73.1 percent reported they graduated among the top 2 percent of students in their graduating classes.
Slightly more than 46 percent of students also applied to Yale. Among these students, 35.6 percent were accepted to the New Haven university.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
As the coronavirus continues to spread on Harvard’s campus and throughout Cambridge, Harvard Art Museums will require visitors and staff to present proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test upon entry later this month.
The policy will take effect at all Harvard Art Museums property, which includes three museums and four research centers, starting Sept. 28, the Harvard Art Museums director announced Tuesday. Proof of vaccination includes a Centers for Disease Control vaccination card, a photo of the card, or a digital vaccine record. If proof of vaccination is not available, visitors will need to present a negative Covid test taken within the last 72 hours.
Martha Tedeschi, the Art Museums’ director, said in a press release the new policy prioritizes the safety of visitors and staff considering the state of the pandemic across the country.
“This new policy will help us provide a safe environment for all our constituents, as we continue to implement a multi-layered approach to public health measures,” she said. “We’ve worked diligently with Harvard to ensure that everyone on campus and inside our buildings is protected to the highest degree possible.”
Once the new policy takes effect, children under 12 years of age will not be required to present proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test, but they will need to be accompanied by an adult who can.
The Harvard Art Museums reopened at the beginning of September after being closed for 18 months. In March 2020, Harvard’s museums shuttered along with much of the University’s campus.
When they reopened earlier this month, Harvard Art Museums implemented a range of public health guidelines to protect staff, students, and visitors from infection. The museums are operating at reduced capacity, requiring visitors to make reservations in advance, and implementing mask mandates.
The new policy requiring proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test will complement those existing restrictions.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
On Friday and Saturday, the Malkin Athletic Center gymnasium played host to the Harvard Invitational, as Harvard women’s volleyball played its first three matches of the 2021 season.
In vital tune-ups before the Ivy League regular season begins on Sept. 24 at Dartmouth, the Crimson (1-2, 0-0 Ivy) bounced back from losses against Marist College and Austin Peay State University to claim victory against Merrimack College in its final game of the tournament.
HARVARD 3, MERRIMACK 1
The Crimson led from the outset against the Warriors (0-7, 0-0 NEC), who had yet to win a set in the 2021 season, and despite some early challenges, rebounded with a strong fourth set to comfortably claim its first victory of the season.
Harvard set the tone early, winning the first three points of the first set behind the strength of two kills by sophomore outside hitter Katie Vorhies and one by junior captain Jaimie Rao. These three early points would serve as a preview of Harvard’s dominance above the net for the rest of the match. The pair would go on to lead the Crimson in kills, with 16 apiece, as Harvard racked up 67 kills to the Warriors’ 37.
“It starts with the pass, and we have our awesome defense, and they’re just working really hard out there, and then we’ve got our setters, who are working hard, running all over the court, like [sophomore setter Ashley Wang], to get us those perfect sets,” explained Vorhies when asked about her success in kill situations.
Later in the first set, though, Merrimack would charge back, as the Warriors went on a 10-2 run to take a 24-22 lead after falling behind 20-14, putting them within one point of their first set victory of the season. Then, head coach Jennifer Weiss opted to put Wang in the game. Her decision to turn to the sophomore from Bolton, Mass., was immediately rewarded. Wang hustled to make a brilliant save, bumping the ball back over her head as she went crashing into the stands, keeping the play alive for it to eventually finish with an attack error by Merrimack middle hitter Kara Haase.
A few points later, the 6’1” left-hander was again in the center of the action as she finished off a set from first-year setter Rocky Aguirre with a kill to close out the first game for the Crimson, 28-26.
“I was definitely a little nervous at first. But I think it’s just putting it all out there on the line for my team and knowing that my teammates have my back. And then getting that game-winning kill was a great feeling, and just [knowing that all of my teammates support me] is amazing,” Wang said.
In the second game, Harvard fell behind early, as Wang’s service error stretched the Warriors’ early advantage to 13-8. Nonetheless, even after early tribulations, the Crimson stayed resolute, and the team’s patience eventually paid off. Despite Merrimack’s five-point lead, the Warriors started committing attack errors, and Harvard took advantage by converting kills en route to a 17-5 run and 25-18 set victory.
“Something I was thinking about is just how we need to work on all the little things and do the little things right, and just remember that our individual skills are going to correlate to the team’s success, and just trying to leave it all out there on the court,” said Vorhies of the comeback.
The Warriors refused to go away quietly, though. In a hard-fought third game, they erased an early 13-9 Harvard lead to grind out a 26-24 set victory, punctuated by a service ace by junior setter Quinn Kellogg, forcing the Crimson into a fourth set.
Merrimack, however, was unable to match its third-set intensity in the fourth. Harvard raced out to an early 6-2 lead behind two early service aces by Aguirre and never looked back, racing to a 25-14 victory to close out the match. The Crimson punctuated the victory with yet another service ace, this time by sophomore middle hitter Olivia Cooper, running its total to 12, compared to the Warriors’ 9.
“That third set that we lost, for us that was something where we were up and then they came back. We know that we have it in us, and they just got a run on us for a while, and that’s something that we talked about and we knew we could come back from it. And I think we really just came out with that much more fire,” Vorhies said.
“I think we all have confidence in each other that we know how to play volleyball and that we can win this game,” Wang added.
Vorhies and Rao led the team with 16 kills apiece, while Aguirre had 24 assists. Cooper again recorded five blocks to pace the Crimson, and first-year libero Lindsey Zhang chipped in with 15 digs. Meanwhile, from behind the service line, it was a team effort, with Cooper, Wang, and Aguirre each recording three aces.
Harvard will attempt to ride its momentum into next weekend’s Northeastern Tournament in Boston, where the Crimson will face Bryant (3-2, 0-0 NEC), Villanova (3-3, 0-0 Big East), and hosts Northeastern (2-4, 0-0 CAA).
HARVARD 0, AUSTIN PEAY 3
In its Saturday afternoon matchup, Harvard suffered a 3-0 defeat at the hands of Austin Peay (4-2, 0-0 OVC). The Governors governed the game from the beginning, cruising to victory in each of the three sets. In particular, Harvard struggled with its service return, yielding eight aces while recording just two. Sophomore outside hitter Katie Vorhies emphasized the need for improvement in that area before the Crimson participates in the Northeastern Tournament next week in Boston.
“I think our service return is a big thing right now. That’s something that we’ve been working on in practice, and we’ve got a lot of room for improvement,” said Vorhies after the team’s victory against Merrimack College later in the day. “We’re all just working hard to try to get that where it needs to be.”
Harvard raced out to a quick lead in the first set, taking a 6-3 advantage behind a kill from Rao. However, Austin Peay clawed back, tying the set at 10 points apiece before a slew of errors from the Crimson allowed the Governors to win five consecutive points, putting the game in a precarious position at 15-10. Harvard coach Jennifer Weiss’ timeout at 19-12 was not enough to reset her team, as Austin Peay went on to close out the set at 25-16.
The second set consisted of a series of streaks, with neither team seemingly able to ward off the other’s momentum. An early 10-0 run was enough to put the Governors in the driver’s seat, achieving a 13-3 lead on the strength of a Brooke Moore kill. Harvard would later rally with a 7-1 run of its own behind three kills from Vorhies, who would go on to lead the Crimson with 16, to narrow the set to 15-11. But Austin Peay quickly responded with another 7-0 run to put the game all but out of reach at 23-12. The Governors would later close out the set, 25-15, on a kill from Mikayla Powell.
In the third set, the Crimson fell behind early and was unable to recover. A combination of errors from Harvard and a service ace from Erin Eisenhart let the Governors win five of the match’s first six points. Although the Crimson later rallied to tie the set at 8-8 after a block by Cooper, the Governors clawed back with another 5-1 run to give themselves a sizable cushion once again. Consistent with its overall dominance, Austin Peay closed with a Kelsey Mead service ace to finish off the set 25-15 and hand Harvard its second loss of the season-opening tournament.
Harvard did not have much time to rue the loss though, as the Crimson squad had only an hour to recover before preparing to face Merrimack College at 7 p.m. According to Wang, the team discussed making the most of kill opportunities after the Governors racked up 42 kills to the Crimson’s 27, as well as recuperating physically and mentally before the evening’s match.
“We just worked on finding the seams, the openings in the blocks, and just really having confidence in ourselves in putting those balls down. [In the loss to Austin Peay,] we might have been a little more timid in those,” explained Wang after the Merrimack game. “We had about an hour in between before we started prepping for the next game. I think a lot of us just went and relaxed and shook off our first game’s loss, just because [this afternoon] didn’t go exactly how we wanted to, so we all just took that time to reset, recharge, and just reset our minds to get prepared for this next game.”
Vorhies led the Crimson with eight kills, while she and first-year libero Lindsey Zhang tied with one service ace apiece. Zhang recorded nine digs, while Wang had 12 assists. Cooper led the team with five blocks.
HARVARD 2, MARIST 3
In a hard-fought five sets, Harvard lost a nail-biter to Marist College (3-4, 0-0 MAAC) in its opening match of the 2021 season. Despite the loss in the match, Harvard scored several statistical victories over the course of the day, racking up 59 kills to Marist’s 48 and 14 aces to the Red Foxes’ five.
Crucial moments came in the first set, a competitive affair that the Red Foxes took by a score of 28-26. Harvard earned a set point at 24-23, after first-year outside hitter Corinne Furey recorded a kill, and then again at 25-24, thanks to a similar play from Rao. The Crimson could not clinch the final point though, and the Red Foxes roared back with two blocks and a kill from Vanessa Zolg to close out the set.
In the second and third sets, the Crimson never let the Red Foxes have a chance. After Marist pulled within 15-13 in the second set, Harvard responded with five consecutive points to put it out of reach, ultimately winning 25-19. The third set was a more dominant affair, with Harvard winning six of the first eight points before holding on to secure a comfortable 25-16 set victory.
Marist looked to be cruising towards forcing a deciding fifth set after taking a 22-17 lead in the fourth. Harvard roared back, though, behind the strength of two kills from Rao and two more from Vorhies, who would ultimately wind up with a career-high 17, forcing Marist coach Sean Byron to call a timeout. Byron’s timeout reset his team, and the Red Foxes won the final three points of the set, finishing with a flourish on Gabby Murray’s kill.
The decisive fifth set was back-and-forth early on as Rao and sophomore middle blocker Ava Rauser combined for a block to give the Crimson a 10-8 lead following a Marist timeout. After that, however, the tide turned as the Red Foxes took advantage of a few Crimson errors to win six consecutive points and secure four match points with a 14-10 lead. Harvard staved off one of them with a kill from Wang, but on the next point, Zolg and Sasha Van der Merwe combined to block Katie Vorhies’ kill attempt and win the match for the Red Foxes.
Harvard was led by a career-high 20 kills from Rao. Meanwhile, Wang led the team with six aces and 28 assists. Rauser managed to block six of Marist’s kill attempts, and Zhang had 13 digs.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard women’s soccer remained undefeated as it overcame St. John’s 3-2 in overtime at Jordan Field on Sunday afternoon thanks to a game-winning goal by first-year forward Hannah Bebar. The Crimson (3-0, 0-0 Ivy) rebounded after conceding two goals off corner kicks in the second half as it relinquished its 2-0 halftime lead.
Beyond ending the game, Bebar’s goal was noteworthy for being the Naperville, Ill., native’s first career goal. She chose a good way to celebrate her birthday, driving at the St. John’s defense from midfield, evading three tackles, and scoring from an improbable angle to the goalkeeper’s left with a perfectly weighted chip over the goalie from about 12 yards out.
“It felt great [to score my first goal],” Bebar said. “I just think it was a whole team effort. We just put it together in overtime and said we needed to outcompete them and had to want to win more than they did.”
Bebar’s goal was the second memorable Harvard finish of the game. Junior forward Angela Caloia continued her strong start to the season by kicking off the scoring in the fifth minute, as she picked up the ball in space, took a touch, and finished superbly off the crossbar from outside the 18-yard box. Caloia has now scored a goal in each of the Crimson’s three games and, beyond her scoring, provides Harvard with confidence, technical polish, and a tendency to be in the right place at the right time around the goal. Often playing with her back to goal, her ability to control the ball and find teammates under pressure helped spur some of the Crimson’s best chances to score from open play, most of which came in the first half.
Sophomore defender Taylor Fasnacht added her first career college goal later in the first half, just seconds after she entered the game. After an intelligent run from right midfield, Fasnacht found herself open in front of the goal. She needed only to deflect the ball past the Red Storm goalkeeper after an incisive cross by first-year defender Hildur Hakonardottir put her through on goal.
The eye-catching performances by many of Harvard’s underclassmen came after head coach Chris Hamblin once again opted to field an inexperienced starting lineup. Six of the 11 Crimson starters were first-years.
“We’re still trying out a bunch of different rotations and trying to see what works,” Hamblin said. “We don’t have all the answers right now, but we’re trying to figure out what that looks like. So we’re going to continue to experiment throughout the time period.”
The starters drove Harvard to a flying start, with Caloia’s goal punctuating a number of dangerous attacks in the first 10 minutes. The Crimson not only posted a 2-0 halftime lead but also controlled play in the first stanza. Harvard outshot the Red Storm 10-2 and smothered any brief promising St. John’s attacks with a ferocious press that usually won the ball back after two or three passes.
“I think our front line is so skilled … it’s meshing really well,” said Bebar, one of the six underclassmen who started on Sunday. “We are still building that chemistry, but I love playing with them and can’t wait for the rest of the season.”
But while Harvard’s technical superiority was evident throughout the first half, the Crimson’s inexperience showed through in the second half. Both St. John’s goals came directly from corner kicks, and the Red Storm had a few other chances to score more in the second period, usually off of set pieces or a mistake from Harvard’s defense.
“Coming in late as an Ivy League program, we don’t get to play scrimmages against high-level competition,” Hamblin said. “We hadn’t really faced a lot of corner kicks yet. I think we’ve only had one corner kick against us until today. And so it was obviously an area that we are going to go back and look at and say how can we fix it, because they obviously managed to get us with two corner kicks.”
While the Crimson ended up outshooting its opponents 18-9 and controlling most of the game, the two set-piece goals and St. John’s second-half fight ensured that overtime and Bebar’s spectacular solo effort were needed to separate the two teams.
“It was a cliche game of two halves,” Hamblin said. “The first half we did pretty well, and we were able to move the ball, create a lot of chances, and were unlucky not to score a few more goals. And then in the second half, they came out and they pressed us really, really hard, and they worked to their game plan and put us on our heels. And we kind of bent but didn’t break.”
Harvard will be back in action at Jordan Field on Thursday as it has a date with Boston College (5-1, 0-0 ACC). The Eagles should mark another step up in competition for the Crimson as Harvard continues to prepare for the start of the Ivy League season on Sept. 25.
