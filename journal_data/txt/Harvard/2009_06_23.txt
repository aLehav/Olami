After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Despite a week of consistent protests following a disputed presidential election in Iran, most Harvard Middle East scholars interviewed in recent days said they doubt the Iranian opposition will succeed in ushering their own reform-minded candidate into power, though the professors said the events have left the Islamic Republic weaker.
Most professors said they view a widespread crackdown by the Iranian government as more probable than an overhaul of the existing regime structure, though the majority also said they could not write off the possibility of a full-fledged revolution.
The protests began a little over a week ago, when thousands of Iranians took to the streets after officials announced a landslide victory for incumbent hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over reform candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. Protesters alleged widespread electoral fraud, and rallies intensified throughout the week, and have since drawn sometimes violent reactions from the government.
Kennedy School Professor Graham T. Allison, whose specialties include Iran and international defense, said that the outcome of those protests is more likely to resemble Tiananmen Square in 1989 rather than Iran’s Islamic Revolution in 1979. But he added that recent elections, whose results he said were most likely fraudulent, have “significantly weakened” the legitimacy of the “mullah-cracy.”
Kennedy School Professor Emeritus Marvin Kalb, whose area of expertise also includes Iran, also said he does not see a new regime taking charge, even if the current structure will have to accommodate new realities. “No matter what happens over the next couple of weeks and months, the government of Iran cannot stay the same,” Kalb said.
Nonetheless, Kalb said that a significant shift has already taken place: “People are prepared to go into the streets and say things they have been afraid to say or not willing to say in the past 25 years.”
History Professor Charles S. Maier ’60 compared predicting a revolution in Iran to a weather forecast. 
“It’s like saying, ‘Will the weather be fine tomorrow or rainy?’ No one can tell you with authority,” he said. “It seems hard to believe a revolution can take place, but that seemed hard in 1979 too, and it seemed hard in many other places [where revolutions occurred].” 
Maier added that “a serious type of long-term civil war” would most likely be necessary for a revolution to take place.
But History Professor Roy P. Mottahedeh, who specializes in Middle Eastern intellectual history and is of Iranian descent, said he believes a revolution may occur, and added that it is important to remember that since martyrs sanctify any cause in the Iranian context, the more people the regime kills, the more the opposition will feel “sanctified.”
Mottahedeh also suggested that the West may not have as much to fear from the threat of a nuclear Iran as it thinks.
“The Iranian government is so disorganized that God knows if they even know where [the nuclear program] is,” he said. “It’s fractured, I should say—not disorganized. So fractured that one part doesn’t know what the other part’s doing.”
But Law Professor Alan M. Dershowitz said that the United States must take whatever steps necessary to ensure that Iran does not procure a nuclear bomb. 
“This is a suicidal nation,” he said. “It’s a terrorist nation.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Harvard announced Tuesday that it would lay off 275 employees from across the University in coming days, while offering reduced or changed work hours to approximately 40 others. Administrative and professional jobs will comprise roughly half of the eliminated positions, with clerical and technical jobs making up the remainder, according to the e-mailed announcement from Marilyn Hausammann, Harvard's Vice President for Human Resources. She wrote that service and trade workers will be largely unaffected.The announcement of the cuts—which University President Drew G. Faust described in a complementary e-mail as "modest in comparison to the overall size of our University-wide staff, but nonetheless painful"—caps weeks of swirling speculation that Harvard would seek to conduct layoffs shortly after Commencement activities. The downsizing is one of the most prominent budget-cutting measures to date following a semester of fiscal anxiety that has seen the trimming of student services, the curtailing of capital projects, and the implementation of a sweeping early retirement incentive program for staff. As of Oct. 31, there were approximately 13,000 full-time equivalent non-faculty staff employees at the University, according to a report from the Provost's Web site. That number has likely been reduced since then, with roughly 530 employees accepting early retirement incentive packages this spring.Yet, despite the relatively small number of staff affected by the reductions announced today, decisions to lay off staff, "in their human dimensions, are among the hardest that an institution like ours can make," Faust wrote. She emphasized that "difficult circumstances have called for difficult decisions across the University," and Hausammann pointed to the projected 30 percent drop in the endowment and other revenue pressures as motivation for the layoffs.Most of Harvard's schools will implement the cuts this coming week, Faust wrote in her e-mail, with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard Medical School, the central administration, and "several of the allied institutions" to follow beginning next Monday, June 29. FAS Dean Michael D. Smith wrote in an e-mail to faculty and staff today that the notification process for the layoffs would begin at Harvard College Library today, with the rest of FAS following next week.The University will support the laid-off staff by providing 60 days of pay from time of notification, severance benefits, and continued medical and dental benefits for 18 months. Non-union, administrative, and professional staff are eligible for employment coaching and outplacement services, and unionized workers are eligible for three additional months of paid work security, during which they will receive case-management services, according to University spokesman Kevin Galvin.Galvin declined to comment on the cost savings achieved by the cuts, but said that the layoffs announced today represent a "significant step" in aligning Harvard with its current fiscal reality. He added that while administrators "do not have any current plans for additional University-wide reductions," the need for further budget cuts could not be ruled out as Harvard reshapes itself in a volatile global financial environment.Although faculty, students, and staff across the University have long anticipated the impending staff cuts—Harvard officials often emphasize the need to trim compensation costs, which make up roughly half of the University's $3.5 billion operating budget—the layoffs appear to be have implemented quickly. Only three weeks earlier, in early June, both Galvin and Bill Jaeger, director of the Harvard Union for Clerical and Technical Workers, said that negotiations about staff reductions remained in very early stages, with discussions of a timeline for layoffs premature.Most of the affected staff members, Galvin said today, would be leaving campus roughly two weeks after notification.Jaeger said in a phone interview that the number of workers to be laid-off was not yet finalized, and that conversations and consultation between human resource officials and union representatives are "active and ongoing." Even today, he said, he had attended meetings and discussions that resulted in "creative solutions" and a reduction in the number of staff affected by the layoffs.Furthermore, despite the reduction in staff positions, Jaeger said that all of the HUCTW workers affected by the layoffs should "absolutely" be able to find alternative jobs at the University in the coming months. He said that even the definition of the word 'layoff' is ambiguous in some cases, since staff in various schools and departments are being told that they can either lose their employment or consider alternative jobs.In her e-mail, Hausammann said that the University would institute a 30-day external hiring freeze for staff jobs in order to allow internal candidates to fill job openings, and Jaeger noted that dozens of jobs are currently posted on the employee intranet. He also said that many more jobs would be posted in the coming days and weeks since various schools had previously withheld job postings in order to deny external applicants. The negotiations about the layoffs between Union and human resource officials were made in "good faith" by the University, said Galvin, who noted that by the time the layoff process is complete, there will have been roughly 75 bargaining sessions conducted over four weeks. He said that during these meetings, representatives from Harvard "either suggested alternatives to layoff or entertained union suggestions, explored or agreed to some voluntary process for layoff selection, and generally answered questions and responded to follow-up information requests."But Jaeger said the discussions have been of mixed success, depending on the location or unit, because of the differing budget situations and managerial personalities. While emphasizing that discussions would continue at several schools and departments, he also said he wished there could have been a "few more weeks" for negotiations at many locations."In some cases, [there are] cuts in the level of service to faculty and students or compromises in terms of quality, which I think most people would have to consider unfortunate," he said. "But we recognize on the other hand that the University does have to make adjustments in order to live with constrained revenue and realities."In the next month or two, Jaeger said, the Union will focus on continuing to explore alternatives to layoffs and then turn its energies to questions of staff placement. "We've wanted to have as meaningful of a process as possible before final notifications, but where there's more to talk about, were going to insist the conversation continues," Jaeger said.—Send tips, comments on the layoffs to news@thecrimson.com.—Staff writer Peter F.

Dear Colleagues,
As
all of you know, this past year has created a set of extraordinary
financial challenges for our university as it has for others. I am
grateful for the continuing efforts made by people across Harvard to
confront these new realities with thoughtfulness and care, and with an
emphasis on sustaining the strength of our core academic programs.
With
compensation accounting for so high a proportion of our budget, we will
enter the 2009-10 academic year with salaries held flat for faculty and
exempt staff; we have also offered a voluntary early retirement program
in which more than 500 staff members across Harvard have chosen to
participate.
While
these actions have helped us reduce expenses, we nevertheless have more
we must do. In the coming days, Harvard’s Schools and units, as well as
its central administration, will be carrying out a reduction in the
size of our workforce — modest in comparison to the overall size of our
University-wide staff, but nonetheless painful for those people
directly affected, as well as for our community as a whole. Most of the
Schools will carry out the process this week; the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, the Medical School, the central administration, and several
of the allied institutions will follow, beginning on June 29.
Such
decisions, in their human dimensions, are among the hardest that an
institution like ours can make. But difficult circumstances have called
for difficult decisions across the University.
As
we proceed through this complicated transition, I want again to express
my appreciation to all of you for your dedicated efforts on Harvard's
behalf. A letter from Marilyn Hausammann, our vice president for human
resources, explaining more about the planned reductions, appears below.
Sincerely,
Drew Faust
Dear Colleagues,
I
am writing to let you know that most of the Schools, allied
institutions, and units in the central administration at Harvard will
be carrying out a reduction in our workforce over the next seven
business days.
The
size and scope of the reductions will vary across the Schools and
units, but when taken together these changes will result in the
elimination of approximately 275 staff positions. About 40 more staff
members will be offered positions with reduced work hours or an
academic year schedule. Deans at the affected Schools and department
leaders will be communicating directly with their staff members about
the changes taking place in their local communities over the coming
days.
We regret the
impact this will have on the lives of our valued colleagues. This
decision was driven by the financial challenges facing the University
after a projected 30 percent drop in our endowment, as well as pressure
on other revenue sources, and it should not be allowed to diminish the
many contributions made by these staff members during their time with
the University.
Over
the past six months, managers across the University have scrubbed their
budgets for non-personnel savings, canceled or curtailed travel, and
limited other discretionary spending. We have slowed development in
Allston, strictly limited hiring, and reduced our reliance on outside
contractors. We have held salaries flat for the coming year for our
faculty and exempt staff, a move affecting more than 9,000 individuals.
And the Voluntary Early Retirement Program that was offered to about

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Most staff workers had forecasted the news for months, and the unprecedented fiscal slump had left no budget-cutting measure too improbable to consider. But the reality of losing 275 employees in one sweep has nonetheless aroused the bitterness of staff members who learned Tuesday morning of the downsizing to come. 
“The whole process has been handled so poorly. It’s been unforgivable, insufferable, and unconscionable,” said Richard E. Kaufman, a librarian in the psychology department. “It’s been painful to watch. The whole process has been incredibly stressful because nothing’s been explained, really, or mitigated up until now.”
In a letter to faculty and staff at Harvard Law School today, interim dean Howell E. Jackson wrote that 12 people would be notified by five o’clock tomorrow that they would be laid off. 
And at a meeting last week, personnel informed 32 faculty assistants at the Law School that two of them would have to go, according to faculty assistant Maura H. Kelley, who said she found the gathering “very upsetting.” She said the convened staffers were given 48 hours to accept a voluntary layoff, but only one faculty assistant stepped forward to take the offer—leaving a looming job cut whose victim has yet to be determined.
“It’s been very hard to focus on work…The morale is in the toilet,” said Kelley, who decided not to take the early retirement package this spring. “I’ve worked here for 28 years, and I’ve been here in the good times and the bad times—this, to me, is the worst of all times.”
Most staffers expressed irritation at the amount of secrecy surrounding an issue that affects their livelihood. The letters from University President Drew G. Faust and Vice President for Human Resources Marilyn Hausammann were “a bunch of fluff” indicative of a dearth of leadership and guidance, Kaufman said. The administration had been withholding information in “this incredibly repressive secrecy” up until the final moment—when the ax was already poised to fall.
Administrators informed of the layoff plans were cautioned by the University to avoid any discussions with staff workers prior to today’s official announcement, according to an administrator who asked to not be named in order to protect the confidentiality of his colleagues.
“There’s no transparency here. We’re not being told anything until it’s already a done deal, and that makes it harder to keep working,” said Kelley, who noted that in her area, staff workers, who have wide-ranging grasps of administrative expenses and operations, had not been consulted at all during the planning for this past year’s cost reductions. “I wish that Harvard would act in a more forthright manner,” she said.
Though the announcement has inflamed resentment, several staffers said the news did not come as a surprise. Rumors of job cuts had begun to circulate as early as November, when the University announced a hiring freeze on most staff positions, and the possibility further solidified with the announcement of the early retirement incentive program in February. 
But even towards the end of the school year, Michael D. Smith, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, vehemently denied that the administration had selected specific individuals for layoffs. Many conjectured that job eliminations would be announced after Commencement activities.
“It’s awful because everyone’s been talking about this for days,” said Beth Baiter, shortly after receiving the e-mail this morning. Baiter, a staff assistant at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, said the sense of unsettling expectation preceding the arrival of the news provoked speculation among her colleagues
“On Friday, everybody was saying, ‘Monday is going to be Black Monday; we’re going to hear,'" she said. "But people were increasingly concerned when nothing came out yesterday. Then they said, ‘Alright, it’s going to be Black Friday.’”
Most of the schools across the University will inform staff workers of the layoffs this week, but the Medical School, FAS, and central administration will begin the process next Monday. Baiter said that the spaced-out timeline will only induce hand-wringing from staff workers awaiting the day that their division breaks the news.
“Why in the hell are they doing that? This means that people who didn’t take the package—who probably should have—are going to think, ‘Oh my God, I’m on the chopping block,’” Baiter said. “Everybody’s going to be totally uneasy all week long.”
