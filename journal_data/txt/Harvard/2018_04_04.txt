“This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years.” - Fox News Analyst Geraldo Rivera.
This sentiment appears to be a relatively popular one. According to a poll published by the Pew Research Center in 2008, more than 70 percent of Americans believed that rap had an overall negative impact on society. Some rap and hip-hop songs do indeed glamorize destructive behavior like substance abuse and violence.But artists like 21 Savage and Meek Mill, whose music sometimes lionizes illegal activity, also lament these very crimes, and the fact that they occur disproportionately in low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods. When rappers do decide to celebrate these crimes, it is often simply because that is the type of music that sells.
21 Savage’s “Nothin New,” which appeared on “Issa Album,” his latest album and his first composition to reach number two on Billboard’s Top 200 chart, explains this motive. In the lyrics, he says, “They thought I only rapped about murder and pistols / I’m tryna feed my family, I ain’t being political.” Sometimes, even for rappers like 21 Savage who are known for their thuggish lyrics, the only way to generate revenue is to produce what people want to hear. For reasons beyond the scope of this article, that often includes the lionization of violence. Rappers don’t necessarily intend to set a poor example for America’s youth—they are simply trying to do what it takes to earn money, just as any other professional does. Moreover, many rappers come from impoverished neighborhoods and realize that, if they don’t seize the opportunity to make music that sells while they have the chance, they may never get another shot.
When rappers do indeed resort to “being political,” they often receive a flurry of backlash. In his last album, “Revival,” Eminem strongly chastised Donald Trump and was immediately rebuked by many listeners including prior fans, many of whom promised never to listen to his music again.
Nethertheless, rappers do continue to speak out about structural issues in American society that lead to the problems we still see today in black communities. In “Nothin New,” 21 Savage says, “Shit gettin’ outrageous / Treat us like slaves then they lock us up in cages / Young, black, poor, ain’t had a father since a baby / Why you think we skip school and hang out on the pavement? / Why you think we ridin’ ‘round with choppers off safety?” With these lyrics, he addresses how disproportionate rates of African American incarceration spark other issues that plague poor black communities. In Meek Mill’s “Wins and Losses,” which reached its zenith at Billboard’s number three spot, Meek Mill criticizes the low quality of education available to many poor African Americans. “My teacher always used to tell me you gon’ lose n**** / That’s why I never went to school n****,” he raps. Kendrick Lamar also weighs in with his track, “m.A.A.d. city,” on his platinum album “good kid m.A.A.d. city,” saying, “They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except / When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain’t no threat,” further rebuking institutionalized racism that leaves many black families without sufficient aid.
There are also many songs that directly condemn violence and drug abuse in poor black communities.  In “Polo and Shell Tops” in his album “Dreams and Nightmares,” which reached number one on Billboard’s chart, Meek Mill says, “Homies murder other homies just to make a brick,” criticizing both violence and the influence of illegal drugs. In Wale’s “Ambition,” in which Meek Mill is featured, he mourns this illicit lifestyle. Yet he also rationalizes it, saying, “Only hope I had was selling dope / Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor.” He argues that lack of economic opportunity pushes many African Americans in impoverished communities toward illegal activity.
To argue that hip-hop has harmed black people more than modern racism is to ignore these messages, among many others. Though some songs do indeed glorify illegal activity that is disproportionately found at alarmingly high rates in low income black communities, plenty of songs lament these issues and critique their causes. Many songs that highlight issues in the black community are exceptionally popular, which indicates that these messages are  heard, if not always widely understood. If opponents of rap music can listen to these pieces and still insist that rap only sends negative messages, they should listen closer.
—Contributing writer Uzochi P. Nwoko’s column, “Where Rap Meets Race,” explores how predominant motifs in rap impact the black community.

Pandas are a rare sight in the United States. After Bao Bao left the National Zoo in D.C. last year, only 12 giant pandas remain in the country. Director and producer of “Born to Be Wild” Drew Fellman brings a treat of IMAX quality shots of some of the most universally beloved animals in his new documentary, “Pandas.” Fellman weaves together a story of people who work together across countries to populate the once-panda-rich forests in China with these large furry mammals once again.
The film takes place at the Chengdu Panda Base, where “panda mom” and researcher Hou Rong struggles to find the best way to introduce pandas bred and brought up in captivity back into the wild. Her research leads her to Lyme, New Hampshire, where biologist Ben Kilham infamously raised over 100 cubs in captivity over the span of 30 years, eventually releasing them all into the wild. The story is enticing and encouraging, bringing in local Wen Lei Bi from the Sichuan province and wildlife researcher Jacob Owens as the starring panda’s closest human mentors.
“Pandas” especially shines in its earlier scenes, when the babies are nursed and cuddly, their eyes closed. The playfulness of the scenes add to the overall emotional draw of the lovable nature of these animals. Among the pandas, Qian Qian stands out quickly amongst the other pandas and proves herself to be the one chosen for the upcoming task of releasing pandas into the wild.
The IMAX cameras emphasize and draw out the beauty of the sprawling mountains in the landscape where Owens and Bi lead Qian Qian in her training. As Qian Qian grows larger, the task becomes more challenging—Owens can no longer wrestle as easily with her, her food supply grows larger, and her impending release date draws nearer. Fellman uses the gate between her forest preserve environment and the wild as a symbol for the dramatic step forward that Qian Qian makes, one that brings bittersweet joy.
Kristen Bell, famously the voice of Princess Anna in “Frozen,” is a safe choice for the film’s narration. She’s smooth and soothing, though sometimes the optimism and lack of depth in her voice create disingenuousness. The shot of Qian Qian hesitating at the gate between the preserve and the wild outside of that preserve is indicative of the most powerful message in the film—this is not a success story. Though the collaboration brings us one step closer towards saving giant pandas in the wild, it remains in the early stages of testing and has no guarantee of success. Cherishing this effort,  applauding it, and just appreciating the cause and attempt is a crucial layer of the film.
Ultimately, the pandas, especially Qian Qian, upstage the actors and actresses in the film. Even in the few dark moments of the film, Qian Qian’s soft eyes invoke softness and reassurance. The film sparks the continuous love for these animals for audiences of all generations, reminding them that the struggles pandas face is far from over. Though scenes of the plethora of panda babies bundled at the research base and climbing in their jungle playgrounds at the Chengdu Research Base all ring with positive notes, Qian Qian’s uncertain future in the wild serves as the driving force of calls for continuous efforts towards conservation research of the species.

For this mostly unsatisfying bachelorette party cocktail, throw in a dash of ecstasy, unsavory doses of masculinity, and forgettable shots of emotional exposition. In “The Feels,” shown at the Wicked Queer Film Festival in Boston, fiancées Andi (Constance Wu) and Lu (Angela Trimbur), a mostly happy couple by all appearances, embark on a shared bachelorette weekend that unwinds once Lu accidentally reveals that she’s never had an orgasm. Given the film’s character palette, the conceit is understandably dull: The attendees include Josh (Josh Fadem), Andi’s infantile childhood friend with little self-control and an overwhelmingly noxious presence, an endlessly excitable “Regular” Helen (Ever Mainard), manic pixie dream girl musician Kárin (Kárin Tatoyan), and vanilla Vivien (Lauren Parks). Kárin’s random deliverances of her own love songs fail to add somberness to the slowly unraveling relationship, and the patchiness of the film’s soundtrack epitomizes this haphazard nexus of incompatible friends and strangers. The film’s reality-television style close-up interviews, in which the characters share anecdotes and divulge their fears of intimacy, despite their caricatured quirkiness, are the deepest expositions of character in the entire film and honestly explore the misdirections of sexual awakening. But these thoughtful features are not enough to buoy their feeble displays of friendship.
The meandering pace of the film makes it so that Lu and Andi don’t confront the main problems in their relationship—Lu’s inability to voice her own needs, Andi’s mild but yielding self-absorption—until much later. LaMarque demands early emotional investment in a smarmy saga featuring unlikable and loosely connected characters (likability not being a requisite but an at least palatable substitution for depth), but does not reward curiosity with meaningful character development. The characters also never seem to have productive emotional conversations with each other. Josh, unfailingly laddish and blunt, turns on Andi, demanding, “Are you a dead fish in the bedroom?” He assures Nikki (Jenée LaMarque), Lu’s older and recently separated sister, “Your kids are going to get real messed up.” He’s bafflingly lascivious when he takes a pass at her: “I like a woman. I want a woman.” He almost provides a valuable perspective when he criticizes Andi outright, telling her but seemingly more for the audience, who at this point probably can’t scramble together a substantial understanding of Andi’s personality, “You seem to not be aware of anything going on unless it’s easiest for you.” Not to rail against LaMarque’s lack of generosity, but against her bewildering presentation of character, the only male character in the movie is unbelievably stunted emotionally, and even Kárin, during her insightful and self-aware interview, has to speak in an breathless rush that reinforces her portrayal as a hipster ingénue.
At least LaMarque provides, even offhandedly through interviews, insight into the characters, the diversity and complexity of relationships, and the underbelly of shiny romantic narratives—decidedly unromantic sexual awakenings. Vivien recalls how being in the “worst relationship ever” allowed her to understand and to be more herself and fulfill her sexual needs. Nikki recounts how she was taught male reproductive anatomy, but was taught to call hers a “Missy,” which prompts thoughtful reflection on the spectral hegemony of male pleasure in a film about a gay couple. And then Kárin suggests the privilege of pleasure: “I come from a Middle Eastern family. Orgasms don’t exist in the Middle East.”
“The Feels” hashes out Lu’s orgasm issue and all its attendant compatibility questions too easily at the end, in a way that undermines the entire film’s dramatic project. LaMarque doesn’t develop Andi and Lu’s individual personalities until they are forced, at the end of the movie, for practical reasons and by dint of a hasty and spontaneous showdown, to resolve the issue. Fortunately, Helen’s unabashedly outrageous wisecracks consistently serve airy kernels of humor to the audience. Josh hangs a banner featuring stylized renditions of all of the women’s individual breasts, and suggests that everyone feel each other up to see whose are whose. Helen then announces, “Be prepared to be perplexed. I’m wearing a sports bra.” But aggressive quirkiness ultimately doesn’t save this film.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
In May 2017, an internal task force on diversity and inclusion at the Kennedy School completed a draft report detailing disappointing but unsurprising statistics. Despite an increase in applications across all racial and ethnic groups, minority admissions rates have leveled off, and yield rates of minority students have declined. The Kennedy School has had a diversity problem for a long time—but rather than improving, the issue appears to be getting worse.
We recognize the difficulties that the Kennedy School in particular faces in cultivating diversity. As a relatively new school, the Kennedy School has had less time to grow its endowment. As of March 2017, the school had raised $580 million in its capital campaign. At the time, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said the school will use the funds in part to bolster student financial aid.
That being said, the Kennedy School has still failed to see expected returns to its financial aid and minority recruitment efforts. In light of this, we believe more can be done. In particular, the Kennedy School should further expand its financial aid program. In its draft report, the task force specifically indicated that there was a higher yield rate for the group of admitted students receiving some aid than for those receiving no aid. And of course, increasing the amount of financial aid available will also help diversify the Kennedy School in terms of socioeconomic status, another aspect of diversity in which Harvard, across all its schools, has struggled.
However, it is especially important not to make the mistake of assuming that all students of color require financial aid, or similarly, that only students of color require financial aid. In addition, money is not the only factor in the Kennedy School’s struggle to attract more minority students. To that end, HKS should more actively investigate non-financial factors contributing to its lack of diversity and work to combat these root causes beyond the scope of extending financial aid programs.
We also urge for the immediate expansion of the the Kennedy School's Office of Diversity and Inclusion, which currently consists of just two employees, one of whom is part-time. It is no surprise that such a small, low-funded office, even with the best of intentions, cannot tackle such a long-standing problem. However, with more funding and manpower, we hope that the Office of Diversity and Inclusion will be better equipped to explain the reason for the low minority yield in the past decade, and work to counter that root problem. The Kennedy School has already turned to promising recruitment strategies like hosting an annual conference for prospective minority students and traveling to historically black colleges and universities, and we hope to see those initiatives expanded in the future.
Striving for student diversity is not a purely ideological pursuit. Very tangible harms fall upon the minority students who do attend the Kennedy School. They often feel uncomfortable speaking about issues that impact underrepresented groups, and notice an overall lack of interest in issues of race, ethnicity and gender more generally. When minority students feel this disparity at the Kennedy School, a vicious cycle is produced. Their experiences discourage future admitted students from attending, thus perpetuating a lack of diversity.
For a school that focuses on governing, having a student body that represents the national populace is absolutely essential toward achieving its core purpose. We hope that the Kennedy School invests the time, money, and personnel necessary to combat this salient matter and ensure that its students represent the diversity of the country they hope to lead.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
I’ve led soldiers in combat, managed a multi-billion-dollar construction program, launched companies, and orchestrated disaster response missions overseas. But juggling my responsibilities as a parent while attending the Harvard Kennedy School has been the hardest task of all.
Last December, the Kennedy School officially grew by 91,000 square feet, but not one was designated for childcare. During the official opening of the new buildings, Kennedy School Dean Douglas W. Elmendorf said, “This moment is going to be a transformative one for the Kennedy School.” But was the moment truly transformative, or is the place just a little bigger? As a premier training ground for public leaders, the Kennedy School still does not take a forward-leaning approach to family-inclusive culture by providing childcare facilities for its students or employees. This is particularly important given the relatively large number of students at the Kennedy School. Unfortunately, the example our future leaders see from the Kennedy School leadership is one of tacit indifference to families and children.  When my husband was a mid-career masters' student in public administration from 2013 to 2014, we enjoyed the evening forums and opted into social events. We didn’t have kids then, so we never realized the challenges of student parents—until I joined the Mid-Career Master in Public Administration cohort myself in 2017.I applied to the Kennedy School while nursing my newborn daughter. Cradling a baby in one arm while typing with one free hand was no easy feat. With a husband in the military who deployed to the Middle East, I tried my best to serve as a loving parent while recovering from childbirth. With that husband now stationed in North Carolina, being a geographically single parent at the Kennedy School is another challenge. After receiving the Kennedy School acceptance letter, I called dozens of childcare facilities—Harvard’s childcare program included—but found no guaranteed slot. I was put on waitlists without the assurance that I would have childcare before my program began.Full-time monthly tuition rates for an infant at the childcare centers near Harvard during the 2017-2018 academic year ranged from $2,782 to $3,016 per month—with limited subsidies or discounts for Kennedy School students. Graduate students are not eligible for childcare subsidies from the state. Had I been granted a childcare slot, I would have been forced to take out more loans to afford it.  After a teary night explaining to my family that I would decline the Kennedy School’s admission offer because I was unable to find childcare, my mother decided to resign from her job at the Department of Commerce in Boulder, Colo. to come to Massachusetts to help take care of my daughter.  An unconditionally supportive family who made huge sacrifices has allowed me to make my Kennedy School opportunity work. Not everyone is this fortunate.  The Kennedy School appears to want to lean forward with parent-friendly policies. In July 2017, another mid-career MPA student and I elaborated the need for more lactation spaces to the Kennedy School’s leadership and facilities department by explaining our difficulty accessing only one lactation room. Its usage required us to fill out forms, request time through online scheduling, and its location on the top floor of a building takes us over ten minutes to reach. We also drew the leadership’s attention to the passage of a bill in the House last March. That bill, H.R. 1174: Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act of 2017, would require most federally-run buildings to provide lactation rooms. Though it has only passed the House, it sends a powerful signal about the importance of lactation spaces.
In response, a Kennedy School administrator told us that the Kennedy School would likely construct a suite of lactation spaces and provide additional, more accessible nursing space throughout the Kennedy School campus. Student parents graduating in 2018 won’t benefit from these lactation spaces, and affordable childcare remains an issue, but I’m hopeful these supposedly-planned spaces are a move toward a more family-inclusive culture. We have much further to go, however, to allow talented parents of all socioeconomic backgrounds to be able to apply and attend the Kennedy School.
The Kennedy School should lead by example by demonstrating how to treat the people we serve. Families are the cores of our communities and countries: They are the reason public servants exist. They should not be an afterthought in our planning. With concerted effort, we can have more student parents with partners and families who all feel welcome coming through the doors to learn and grow. 
Public servants and policy makers should not have to choose between having a family and having professional learning and development. More importantly, the Kennedy School should not discourage talent from even entering the applicant pool because its childcare situation is abysmal. Meeting prospective student demand for childcare would show the world that Harvard leans forward in its diversity and inclusion. Right now, the Kennedy School’s inaction shows public servants that they can serve the public and make the world a better place, but only if they don’t have a family.“We shape our buildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us,” Elmendorf said at the buildings’ opening, echoing Winston Churchill. Why then don’t we use resources and space to allow student parents and partners to thrive during their time at the Kennedy School so they can really go back out into the world and make it better?

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Last week, 998 students learned they had been admitted to the Class of 2022, joining their 964 early-admitted peers—the first of many messages that will flood their inboxes in the next few months, advertising a dizzying array of programs, offers, and opportunities. Some will join the College’s pre-orientation programs, and choose to come to Cambridge early to join Dorm Crew or the First-Year Urban Program, or head to New Hampshire and Vermont with the First-Year Outdoor Program. Some will color-code their Visitas calendars and learn about opportunities in public service, arts, on-campus jobs, affinity groups, and any of the myriad paths that you can chart here. But there is one tantalizing offer that they should ignore, one email that merits swift deletion: the bottled water subscription from Harvard Student Agencies.
There is no reason to suppose that bottled water is any better than tap water—our hyper-local water supply is very safe and secure. The water that flows through the taps in your dorm rooms is stored and purified at Fresh Pond, less than two miles from Harvard Yard. This is because Cambridge manages its own municipal watershed, unlike most cities. The Watershed Management Division of the Cambridge Water Department protects the supply chain of Cambridge water before it goes through a five-step purification process to eliminate pathogens and particulate matter. The Water Department even offers free public tours of their treatment facility at Fresh Pond. Cambridge is also connected to the Massachusetts Water Resource Authority, which provides backup water when our aquifers reach abnormally low levels, as occurred in 2016.
Thus, the water that flows through Harvard pipes is the result of a state-of-the-art municipal purification and distribution system, and the end result is consistently safe water. Cambridge has been well within acceptable levels for each trace element that is tracked in every water quality report published since 2003, the earliest year for which statistics are available. Additionally, the City’s standards are almost equivalent to that of the bottled water company Poland Spring, which is similarly compliant. Thus, there are no health-related arguments for ordering bottled water in Cambridge. As a tap water campaign from the freshman sustainability think tank Green ’20 documented last year, Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana and other College notables trust Cambridge water, and the “Cambridge Water: Wicked Good” sticker campaign has spread the word at public water sources throughout the rest of the city.
While bottled water may be comparably safe, it has a substantially negative environmental impact compared to tap water. A study published in Nature found that the ecological and carbon footprints of bottled water outpaced that of tap water by about 300 times, a devastating effect. The Pacific Institute estimates that the petroleum used to manufacture a standard single-use bottle could fill that bottle one-quarter full with oil. This only captures the pre-consumption effects, as the vast majority of bottles end up either in landfills or in waterways; approximately 91 percent of plastic bottles are not recycled. There is also a substantial financial cost to using bottled water, both through HSA and in general, as bottled water is estimated to cost between 300 and 2000 times as much as tap water.
There is certainly more that both Harvard and Cambridge can do to discourage the excessive bottled water consumption that HSA encourages. Cambridge could adopt a tax on bottled water to discourage their use; a similar policy for single-use plastic bags, the Bring Your Own Bag ordinance, has been in effect for several years. For its part, Harvard could apply the same restrictions to HSA’s in-dorm services that it applies to similar businesses, or could ban plastic bottles altogether. This was proposed in a 2013 UC referendum that passed with 64 percent of the vote, and was endorsed by The Crimson Editorial Board.  However, the proposal has not been implemented. Despite this, both the City and the University have already fulfilled their most fundamental responsibility on the issue: to make it safe and convenient for students to drink tap water instead. Harvard has taken actions ranging from creating bottle refill stations, to banning plastic bottle sales at certain campus cafés, to eliminating single-use plastic bottles at Commencement.
The remaining responsibility for reducing single-use plastic bottle consumption on campus lies largely with students, and the incoming freshmen whom HSA targets for water subscriptions can play a pivotal role. So as you get ready for life on campus over the next four years, don’t subscribe to water bottle delivery. Buy a reusable bottle, or pick up one of the myriad reusable bottles that seem to appear at virtually every College-sponsored event here, and use it. Many dorms have in-suite sinks, but even if this requires what HSA refers to as “tiresome runs up and down stairs,” it’s worth it. A marine mammal will thank you.

Dean of the College Rakesh Khurana announced Monday that the Freshman Dean’s Office and the Office of Student Life would merge to form a Dean of Students Office starting in July. This new office, to be led by Dean of Students Katherine G. O’Dair, will oversee residential life, diversity and inclusion initiatives, student experience, and student advising for the entire College, according to Khurana.
Here’s a review of what the FDO and OSL look like now and what will be different after the merger.
Currently, the FDO and OSL split oversight of residential and social life at the College. The FDO—comprising roughly a dozen full-time staff members—administers programming for freshmen. The OSL, which has nearly double that number of staffers, provides support for student organizations, housing operations, and College-wide diversity initiatives. The OSL also works with upperclassmen House management to oversee residential and social programming for sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
Dean of Freshmen Thomas A. Dingman ’67 coordinates with four freshman resident deans and more than 70 proctors to ensure first-year residential life runs smoothly. He also works with the Advising Programs Office and academic concentrations to help first-year students adjust to college-level academic work.
There won’t be anyone with that title—administrators at the DSO will split up the responsibilities that the dean of freshmen currently oversees, like freshman programming and residential life. In an interview last Thursday, O’Dair said she is not yet sure what the specific breakdown in responsibilities will be among DSO administrators. Students can expect more information about that before the DSO’s launch in July.
There will, however, be one administrator tasked with overseeing freshman residential life. According to O’Dair, that person will be the closest thing to the dean of freshmen under the current system.
Khurana said administrators decided on the merger to enable a more “integrated” College experience for students. One of the main goals of the merger—based on student feedback—is to “better integrate” the first-year experience with the sophomore transition to the residential Houses, he said.
Khurana said he has been considering joining the OSL and the FDO almost since he became dean of the College in 2014.
There won’t be layoffs, but the merger may change the responsibilities of employees working in the two offices—some administrators will now be expected to consider both the freshmen and upperclassmen experiences. O’Dair said she is “beginning” to figure out the specifics of what the new job descriptions will look like.
According to Khurana: No. Although switching to the Yale model has garnered some support from administrators in the past, he said the DSO will not consider making that change at this time.
Khurana said freshmen will have more opportunities to “connect with upperclass students” during their first year, but otherwise freshman year will remain similar to its current form.
Harvard is the only Ivy League university with a freshman dean. Most other Ivy League schools, like Yale, do not have a separate residential system for freshmen. Stanford has previously had a freshman dean’s office but has since done away with it.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Cambridge City Council passed an order urging billionaire developer Gerald L. Chan to publicly release a schedule for the development of the long-deserted Harvard Square Theater at a Council meeting Monday.
Vice Mayor Jan Devereux and Cambridge City Councillor Dennis J. Carlone sponsored the legislation. The order is largely symbolic and has no power to force Chan’s hand.
“The City Manager is requested to notify the owners of the former Harvard Square Theater that the City Council has requested that they provide a firm schedule,” the order reads in part.
Chan, who co-founded and currently heads the Morningside Group investment firm, is a billionaire developer and longtime Harvard donor who has, in recent years, snapped up Square real estate. He bought the Harvard Square Theater building—located at 10 Church Street—in 2015.
In February 2017, after the building had sat vacant for five years, the City Council gave Chan 30 days to submit plans for the property. The following May, he announced the building would become a new shopping center, with stores at street level and two movie theaters beneath.
A representative from the Morningside Group could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
Several City Council members said they want to see a schedule for the completion of this plan.
“The issue is the timing. I have no objection whatsoever to what is proposed to replace the current theater,” Devereux said in an interview.
Denise A. Jillson, Executive Director of the Harvard Square Business Association, said the shuttered building on Church Street is beginning to harm local businesses.
“It should come as no surprise to anybody...that there will be an adverse economic impact on other retailers in the area when you have such a large piece of property dark,” she said.
Carlone also said he is worried about the impact of the empty building on the Square, because the theater was once an “active participant” in Cambridge life.
Despite their concerns, Carlone, Devereux, and Jillson all praised Chan and his past work.
“The city really respects the work that Mr. Chan and his team do with the properties that he has,” Jillson said. She pointed out the “wonderful” things that they have done in the Square, with new businesses in his properties ranging from the restaurant Parsnip to Capital One on JFK Street.
Jillson also provided a rationale for the development’s delay. She explained that the 10 Church St.  building poses a particular challenge because it is connected with another property, 1430 Massachusetts Avenue. Design plans for the theater must address accessibility for the owners of the other property.
“The egress for 1430 Mass Ave is made through the theater building. And that’s complicated,” she said. “When you have a building that’s really co-joined in this way, it just requires a little more time to work out the agreements.”
Devereux agreed that the site poses construction problems, but she said she still believes a resolution must be reached soon.
“I’ve been informed that there are complications with having to excavate for the theaters underground,” she said. “Obviously, that needs to be sorted out. At the same time, that complication was known a year ago.”
Carlone, who was a graduate student at Harvard in the ’70s, said he has memories of an older Harvard Square that he would like to see return.
“When I was in school in the ’70s, we would go to the Theater probably three times a month,” he said. “[The Square] was desirable—much more desirable, and I truly believe you saw more people there. It’s changed, and the Theater is part of that.”

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
The Faculty of Arts and Science voted to create a new Environmental Engineering concentration at their monthly meeting Tuesday.
The addition of the new concentration, Environmental Science and Engineering, will bring the total number of concentrations offered to undergraduates up to 50. The Faculty unanimously voted for its creation, and, in a meeting last month, the Faculty Council—FAS’s highest governing body— also unanimously supported the new concentration.
Environmental Engineering Professor Daniel P. Schrag initially presented the proposal to the faculty at their meeting last month. He explained that ESE was the only track within the Engineering Sciences concentration that did not have its own standalone concentration. Currently, students are only able to concentrate in Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, or Electrical Engineering.
During the President’s business portion of the meeting, University President Drew G. Faust said the 2019 spending bill Congress passed last month will have positive effects for the University in various areas. She pointed specifically to increased funding for agencies that support research—like the National Institutes of Health—programs like Federal Work-Study.
She said, though, that the bill is missing a permanent fix for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals—an Obama-era program that allows undocumented youth to legally live and work in the United States—and that she would continue to advocate for undocumented students and faculty. President Donald Trump has vowed to end the program, and over the past year, Faust has met with top lawmakers in Washington, D.C. multiple times to advocate for DACA.
Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria also presented a proposal to create a new Ph.D. program in Business Administration to replace the existing Doctor of Business Administration degree that HBS currently offers. Under the proposal, HBS and FAS will jointly offer the new Ph.D. program.
The Faculty Council has previously voted unanimously to support the proposal. Their vote, however, is purely advisory, and the Faculty will not vote on the proposal until May.
Additionally, Philosophy Professor Sean D. Kelly, who sits on the docket committee of the Faculty Council, announced six new members were elected to the Council for the upcoming academic year. Kelly said a record 294 Faculty members cast ballots in this year’s election, and the new Council members will begin to serve in July.
In contrast to last year, when the Council elected no female faculty to its ranks, half of the new council members are female. Anthropology Professor Anya Bernstein, History Professor Kirsten A. Weld, and East Asian Studies Professor Jie Li will join the Council in July.
Many administrators and professors who spoke at the meeting also praised Smith, who announced last month that he will be stepping down as soon as President-elect Bacow finds a replacement, for his eleven years of work as the FAS Dean.
Faust said Smith had a “steady hand at helm” during his tenure and highlighted his commitment to teaching and diversity issues in FAS. Upon his recognition, the room of faculty members stood up and erupted with applause.

Seniors in the English Department have come together to host “Critical Pizza” sessions on Tuesday evenings over the last few weeks, introducing younger classmates to different types of literary criticism.
The weekly peer-led discussions are held over pizza dinner and organizers said they hope the informal environment will encourage more students to take courses on literary criticism and learn more about the topic.
Grazie S. Christie ’18 proposed the idea for the series last fall, after taking a class on the history of literary criticism. Christie said the class dispelled previous fears she held about the burden of entry and relevance of literary criticism, while helping her understand the material better in other classes.
She said the “Critical Pizza” series is an effort to expose students without previous experience to what sometimes can be seen as an inaccessible topic.
“I took the criticism class and I realized I was doing better in my creative writing. I was doing better in other classes I was taking that were just reading novels,” Christie said. “I felt like my brain was sharper— that my reading was sharper.”
Senior English concentrators volunteer their time to lead sessions on a diversity of topics, like ecocriticism, deconstruction, and author biography analysis.
Christie said that while she originally hoped literary criticism could be integrated as part of the concentration requirements, that proved difficult to do. Instead, she proposed the idea for “Critical Pizza” to the department and she said they offered full support to the endeavor.
Faculty and staff members have taken care of the logistical aspects of the events, booking rooms, publicizing, and even catering, according to Christie.
“They’re really supportive of the way that students try to improve their own curriculum and they really listen,” Christie said.
Attendance at each session has fluctuated depending on the topic, but the numbers have satisfied the organizers, who said they believe the pizza serves as a good incentive. Christie added that attendees have largely been English concentrators, but students from other humanities, and occasionally even STEM fields, have also been present.
Emeline N. Atwood ’18, an English concentrator who ran a discussion on Tuesday said that especially freshmen would benefit from this series as they would have an opportunity to meet upperclassmen in the department, though it has been difficult for her to reach freshmen due to the inability to access first-year mailing lists.
“It’s a casual, relaxed setting to go over things that aren't usually treated that casually,” Atwood said.
Both Christie and Atwood said they have high hopes that the series will continue on to next year and become a bigger part of the department. Christie even added that several students have expressed interest in taking over after she graduates.

Black Sheep Bagel Cafe is tentatively set to open in the lower space of 56 JFK Street in Harvard Square around May, pending the outcome of a licensing commission hearing next week.
If approved, the eatery will join fellow building tenants Good Vibrations, Forty Winks, and the Boston Tea Stop.  According to the proposal sent to the commission, the shop plans to be open everyday from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
Students are already expressing their excitement for the eatery that—according to Boston Eater—will serve over a dozen different types of bagels.
“I definitely think there will be an interest for it,” Grace E. Geiger ‘20 said.
For Geiger, a bagel place is just what Harvard Square needs, especially following the seizure of Market in the Square.
“I feel like we’re missing that college town deli especially since Market closed,” she said.
Sofia C. Shapiro ‘19 feels similarly.
“I love bagels and lox. If they have that there, that would be really exciting for me,” Shapiro said.
Despite apparent demand, there are currently no bagel cafes in Harvard Square. For many students, the go-to place for bagels is Bagelsaurus, which is about a mile away from the Yard. According to Geiger, the establishment is “one of the few perks of the Quad.”
“I’m curious if it’s going to compare,” Richard M. Feder ‘18 said, lamenting the fact that Black Sheep will likely open in May. “I am graduating, so I won’t get to reap the benefits.”
Hillel members also expressed excitement about the opening of Black Sheep. Hillel hosts monthly bagel brunches that are currently catered by a shop in Newton.
“If this place were kosher, that would be super helpful to us. Right now we have to go outside the square to get bagels,” said Rebecca Powell, the student activities director at Harvard Hillel.
Despite the buzz, however, some students said the success of the cafe will depend on its affordability.
“I think people really like the cafe culture, but it’s really expensive, especially for a student,” Geiger said. “So, if this bagel place is a more affordable option, I think it will be pretty popular.”
Denise A. Jillson, the Harvard Square Business Association’s executive director, noted that Black Sheep’s opening would come amid a recent spate of new bistros arriving in the square, including Blue Bottle and Pokeworks.
“There’s no shortage of great food in Harvard Square, or great options,” she said. “We have a lot of great eateries that have either just opened, are about to open, or will open very soon.”

The student-led Sleep Matters Initiative is currently studying the sleeping habits of undergraduates in Quincy and Adams houses, hoping to identify factors that are negatively affecting sleep quality among Harvard undergraduates.
The study aims in part to examine how student-athletes are affected by early morning practices by comparing sleep patterns of athletes on and off season. The initiative also hopes to look at sleep patterns among student body more broadly.
Since the start of the semester, the SMI has asked Quincy and Adams residents to track and report their sleep habits each morning and answer questions about how long they slept, when they went to bed, and what they did before bed.
While SMI members said they want to learn about common factors negatively impacting sleep quality for students overall, they also hope participants will become more aware of their own sleep habits through the semester-long program.
“The overarching goal of the organization is to improve awareness about the importance of sleep and provide education and information to students of the College about sleep tips and how to get better sleep in this environment,”  SMI member Mark E. Czeisler ’19  said.
To encourage participation, the initiative raffles off a Beats Pills speaker every month to participating students. Every two weeks, SMI also awards additional study break funding to the entryway with the highest participation. Brigham and Women's Hospital has provided funding for the project.
In addition to tangible prizes, SMI student leader Sean F. Gibney ’19 said participants will receive “personalized analysis of their sleep habits” and information about how they compare to the average participant.
Quincy and Adams house administrators have allowed SMI to table and hold office hours to find time to work with student participants. Czeisler said house administrators will receive insights about how they can change house activities, like study breaks, to improve residents’ sleep patterns.
Currently, they have collected information from seven thousand nights of sleep.
The current survey of undergraduates draws on research by William M. Clerx ’14, a molecular and cellular biology concentrator who examined the effects of irregular sleep on academic performance in his senior thesis.
Founded three years ago, the initiative is led by eight undergraduates under the guidance of three researchers in the Harvard Medical School’s Division of Sleep Medicine: Charles A. Czeisler ’74,  Laura K. Barger, and Matthew D. Weaver. Czeisler is the Director of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and the professor of MCB 186: “Sleep and Circadian Clocks: from Biology to Public Health.”

“Sometimes I wake up in the morning and hope to see my grandpa waiting there once again to ride along the sugarcane fields,” Saieed Hasnoo ’12 wrote in the application essay that earned him admission to Harvard.
In the essay, he described the leisurely, daylong bike rides that defined his childhood in Trinidad; times when he would silently accompany his grandfather on empty gravel roads past plantations, through forests, and finally to a lake at dusk, where the two would watch birds flying home to their nests. It was by the lake, Saieed wrote, that his grandfather taught him to value family—a value he carried with him throughout his time at Harvard and beyond.
Hasnoo, the Associate Business Manager for the 138th guard of The Harvard Crimson, died Feb. 24 after battling a terminal illness. He would have been 28 years old on April 4.
When he was eight years old, Saieed and his family immigrated from Trinidad to the United States. After attending the Bronx High School of Science, he was accepted by all eight Ivy League schools.
“He was always incredibly confident, always incredibly smart,” said Mohammed Hussain ’15, a close friend of Hasnoo’s since high school. “He had that persona that everybody gravitated towards him.”
Mark A. Tyson, Hasnoo’s partner for four years, recalled that one of Hasnoo’s proudest moments came when he was invited to a dinner with Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein ’75 and a few other students while still in high school. After dinner, the group took a photo together—and Blankfein put his arm around Hasnoo.
Blankfein ultimately provided Hasnoo with the full scholarship that enabled him to attend Harvard.
When he arrived at the College, Hasnoo hung a United States flag in his dorm room, Tyson said. The flag served as a reminder of Hasnoo’s appreciation for America’s social mobility.
“He always wanted to be somebody,” Tyson said. “His dream was to come from nothing and become the CEO of a Fortune 50 company.”
Later in his Harvard career, Hasnoo lived in Currier House and concentrated in Economics. William J. Cember ’12, one of Hasnoo’s blockmates and a close friend, recalled first meeting Hasnoo freshman year and being struck by not only Hasnoo’s drive, intelligence, and bustling personality, but by his kindness and how he strived to be a role model for his family and friends.
“Everyone he’s touched he’s made better,” Cember said.
Hasnoo spent much of his time at Harvard working in various positions on The Crimson’s business board. Hasnoo made “impressive” advertising sales and mentored the Ads Associates and Managers in the years below him, Business Manager of the 138th Guard Martin C. Ye ’12 said. Ye remembered Hasnoo counseling the ad sales team via email to focus on the businesses and their individual needs—advice that helped the oft-stressed college students meet their sales goals, Ye said.
“Now having experience in the corporate world,” Ye said. “It was pretty golden advice.”
According to Ye, Hasnoo always worked to make the sometimes mundane task of ad-selling as interesting and memorable as possible.
One time, Hasnoo organized an “Ads Outing” to a cabin in New Hampshire, where he took Crimson staffers canoeing under the stars. Later, during “turkey shoot”—the process by which The Crimson selects its next leaders—Hasnoo sought to make the interview process more appealing, taking candidates on car rides and grilling them as he zoomed through the streets of Cambridge.
Hasnoo’s final email to the Business Board harkens back to values he espoused in his application essay.
“If I can give any parting advice, it is to cherish each other for the time that you have together,” Hasnoo wrote in the email.
“Saieed had a strong and loving heart,” Ye wrote in an email to the 138th Guard. “I am thankful for the times that we have cherished together.”
In addition to his verve for business, Hasnoo was a passionate and eloquent writer, penning articles both for The Crimson’s Editorial board and for the paper’s blog, Flyby. One of the few openly gay members of the Business Board, Hasnoo wrote about homophobia and marriage equality, as well as the Occupy movement, and even produced videos of recipes using dining hall ingredients.
“Saieed was an incredibly eloquent person, an incredibly thoughtful person,” Naveen N. Srivatsa ’12, the President of The Crimson’s 138th Guard, said. “Someone who can really put forth well thought-out perspectives and argue them with a force.”
After graduating, Hasnoo achieved quick success in the corporate world. He first worked with small business customers as a senior analyst at American Express. After forging close relationships with senior leaders, he rose through the company’s ranks to become a manager at American Express, and then a senior associate at J.P. Morgan.
In his most recent job, Hasnoo worked to manage strategy and partnerships at Capital One. He also founded and advised several startups in industries ranging from fashion to finance.
“He was always pushing himself to be better,” Tyson said. “He had a force to him. He just took you in.”
Hasnoo also volunteered as an admissions interviewer for Harvard College. He took his role introducing promising young students to higher education quite seriously, Hussain said. Hasnoo devoted hours to writing statements on behalf of the applicants who he thought really deserved a chance, and spoke enthusiastically about the ones in whom he saw unusual passion.
“He was just one of those people who care so much about other people’s success and not just his own,” Hussain said.
Hasnoo had a yellow lab named Jackson whom he treated almost like a guest or another person in the household, Cember said.
Hasnoo also loved to travel. Tyson recalled one time when Hasnoo got so involved in haggling with merchants at a Moroccan a market that Tyson had to drag him away, leaving several upset vendors in his wake.
He enjoyed racing luxury cars and was not afraid to go 110 miles an hour, according to Hussain.
“He was fearless,” Hussain said.
He dabbled in painting, acquired a pilot’s license, and collected artwork.
Tyson said Hasnoo’s last words to him urged him not to cry or mourn, but to strive for the better and to look back on their past interactions for inspiration.
“I just think about him just in a casual setting,” Tyson said. “I just imagine him curled up on the couch with Jackson his dog, sipping his diet coke or white wine, maybe with candles in the background, watching House of Cards.”
Hasnoo is survived by his mother, father, brother, and sister-in-law.

Harvard Common Spaces—a division within the University’s Campus Services arm—is launching a new initiative meant to better integrate the University community through pre-programmed events in the Smith Campus Center starting fall 2018.
The Crossroad Series will allow recognized undergraduate and graduate student groups to hold events in a multi-tiered, partially glass-walled space in the newly renovated Smith Campus Center. Crossroad Series events will take place on Wednesdays and Thursdays starting next semester, and will be open to students, faculty, and staff. Some Crossroads Series events will be open to the public as well.
Originally called Holyoke Center, the Smith Campus Center—located in the heart of Harvard Square—was renamed for donors Richard A. and Susan F. Smith in 2015. Renovation began in 2016; the renovated center is slated to open in fall 2018. Once completed, the Smith Campus Center will be the University’s first all-campus, indoor center.
Harvard Common Spaces staffers are leading the development of the Crossroads Series. Julie Crites, the Director of Common Spaces, said the job is an exciting one because “it is the first of its kind throughout all of Harvard’s extraordinary history.”
“The space where we will be hosting the Crossroads Series is really one of the hallmarks community spaces that has been created at the Smith Campus Center,” Crites said. “This large space where the Crossroads Series will take place is called Harvard Commons.”
Crites credited University President Drew G. Faust and the Smith family with the ideas underlying the Crossroad Series.
“The development of the Campus Center has been an opportunity to create common spaces on campus, which has been part of President Faust’s visionary leadership on creating spaces that make this community more integrated,” Crites said.
Tracey Daley, the program coordinator for Harvard Common Spaces, said the Crossroads Series will allow students from different schools within the university to meet and collaborate.
“Coming from the Law School, everything can feel very decentralized,” Daley said. “I am very much looking forward to something that can tie the entire community together.”
Crites said the Crossroads Series will likely prioritize events that are open to the public. Harvard Common Spaces is accepting proposals for student-sponsored events and programs to feature in the Crossroads Series this coming fall semester through May 1.

Applications opened last week for the i-lab’s new alumni-led ventures program called Launch Lab X, a new initiative designed to support eligible start-ups and ventures created by Harvard alumni.
Launch Lab X—which is set to start in September—will offer mentorship, guidance, and resources to accepted applicants for nine months, according to the i-lab’s website. The program is divided into “milestones”—three 90-day “sprints” followed by meetings with investors, customers, and industry experts.
Unlike the many other programs that i-lab offers, Launch Lab X offers support for everyone in the accepted venture, not just the founder.
The i-lab, according to the Launch Lab X’s application page, is looking for 10 teams “driven to create exceptional ventures and contribute to our vibrant community of next-generation innovation” for the program. Launch Lab X does not require rent or equity stake. Accepted teams will also have the opportunity to receive $100,000 through a new alumni category in the annual President’s Innovation Challenge.
Jodi Goldstein, Executive Director of the i-lab, said the purpose of the program is to assist Harvard alumni-founded ventures in the early stages of building a businesses.
“I think most importantly, we’re looking for founders and teams that are really looking to make sustainable ventures that are going to have a real impact on the world,” Goldstein said. “Whatever point you enter the program at, the staff will design a customized program for them.”
Howard Kaplan, Director of Advising at i-lab, said the program is geared towards Harvard alumni founders “looking to disrupt their industry.”
Kaplan said that through this program, the i-lab is giving alumni seeking to grow their business ventures an opportunity “to engage with the Harvard Innovation Lab and join this community that maybe they didn’t have while they were in school.”
Goldstein said that she is looking for teams “from across the globe” who will “reflect the diversity and breadth of ventures and industries that we currently see at the i-lab.”
She added she is also seeking for ventures to “become a part of this community of like-minded founders that we like to call ‘next generation innovation.’”
The application period will last until May 30. Teams who submit written applications before the early deadline of May 1 are guaranteed a tour of the i-lab and an opportunity to meet the team coordinating Launch Lab X. In-person interviews will follow the written applications, when teams will have the opportunity to meet other applicants.
Final decisions for the program will be announced in June.

Rain across the Northeast on Tuesday afternoon forced the Harvard baseball and softball teams to postpone their midweek tilts against Boston College and Boston University, respectively, continuing a trend of several game cancellations and postponements for both squads.
The postponement marks the fourth game this season the Crimson baseball team has had taken off its original timetable due to inclement weather. A three-game set at Princeton from March 24th-25th, originally the team’s Ivy League opener, was also postponed, and it was announced just yesterday that the series will be made up on April 17th-18th. Tuesday’s matchup with the Eagles, the semifinals of the annual Beanpot Tournament, is now set for tomorrow.
The softball team, meanwhile, sees its sixth game of the season either postponed or canceled. A March 10th tilt with Florida Gulf Coast University was canceled and last Thursday’s matchup with Holy Cross was postponed due to inclement weather and field conditions. No rescheduling date has been set. A three-game set at Cornell in March was also pushed back a day, with Harvard dropping the series, 1-2.
In terms of on-field mechanics, the delays look to impact the gameplay minimally.
“It’s normal when it’s raining…we know we’ll have to play the [teams] for league games; it’s just a matter of when,” said softball sophomore utility player Chanel Varney. “It doesn’t really change how we feel about the competition, it just changes when we practice. It’s not a big issue.”
If anything, the delays gave the softball squad extra time to practice, albeit in a different space. To get out of the rain, the team has been practicing in the indoor track alongside the track team, using the facility’s batting cage that lowers from the ceiling.
“When we found out that we wouldn’t have a series against Cornell over [last] weekend and it would have to get pushed on to midweek games, we just saw it as, ‘Okay, we have extra time to prepare for this and we’re going to be as adaptable as possible, because we know we are going to face them,’” Varney said.
In the Northeast, the fact that ill-fated weather interferes with college sports scheduling is nothing new. The coaches expect adaptation and an ability to continue day-to-day operations out of their players.
What is new, however, is the University’s construction of a 6,500 sq. foot hitting pavilion near the Harvard Stadium in Allston. Originally scheduled to be completed in mid-March, the ongoing construction has complicated matters.
“Track has actually been really accommodating since we do have to practice at the same time,” Varney said. “It’s all in consideration of the fact that we have our nice big hitting facility under construction. So once that’s finished, it’ll no longer going to be a conflict of space usage.”
When completed, the new facility will provide more stability in scheduling practice in the New England winter. The fact that the inclement weather is a typical characteristic of the Northeast is visible across the region. Several Ivy baseball teams, including Penn, Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth, in addition to Harvard, have had at least a couple games either postponed or canceled this season.
“Our team is really adaptable,” Varney said. “[Head Coach Jenny Allard] expects that of us. She doesn’t want the weather to ever be a factor—it should be a non-issue. We live in the northeast, we do a good job of that.”
The Crimson baseball squad is 9-13, 1-2 (Ivy League), and takes on a 9-16, 4-8 (ACC) Boston College team tomorrow at Brighton Baseball Field. The game comes as a rematch of last year’s Beanpot Finals in which the Eagles took down Harvard, 3-2, at Fenway Park, in a rain-shortened affair that was called final after the fifth inning.
“We’re excited, we’re confident,” said junior center fielder Ben Skinner. “We have one of the best squads we’ve had in years.”
The Crimson softball squad is 13-11 and currently sits atop the Ivy League standings at 6-3. The bout with Boston University, yet unscheduled, is a standalone non-conference game.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
Free Harvard Basketball t-shirts to student supporters, courtesy of Nike. A model 2018 Porsche exhibited outside the Palestra during the Ivy League Basketball Tournament. A peculiar 9:30 PM tip-off against Yale to accommodate ESPNU’s Basketball Rivalry Week Showcase—sponsored by none other than 5 Hour Energy.
What has been clear throughout my first season covering Harvard men’s basketball is that the Ancient Eight is trending ever so quickly away from the anti-commercial, idiosyncratic traditions of the past. An athletic conference once known for pioneering the Victorian ideals of amateurism, the Ivy League is increasingly embracing the “normal” economic model of larger Division I conferences: using its prestigious school brands, select sports, and high-income supporter base as revenue streams for athletic departments that need to fund more than 35 teams on average, the highest of any national conference. Keep in mind the sheer quantity of varsity sports is also closely tied with the Ivy League’s historical promotion of athletics as an extension of the classroom.
This may be disconcerting for traditionalists who believe that Ancient Eight athletics should be no more than glorified intramurals, but the reality is that certain sports such as men’s basketball and men’s hockey are gaining not only attention from the media, but attention from companies.
We are not talking merely about food trucks or concessions outside of Harvard-Yale. This is about replacing traditions like the 100 year round-robin format of Ivy League Basketball in place of a nationally-televised, four team tournament. This is about partnership deals with consultants such as JMI Sports, who manages the marketing of Kentucky Basketball, Clemson Football, and yes, the Ivy League. Individual schools like Yale are signing equipment deals on the level of Big Ten programs, while several former executives at the very top of the sports & entertainment industry now work for Ancient Eight marketing departments.
Let us be frank here, the commercial value of a conference that can barely make games on ESPN’s auxiliary channels or be mentioned in local news is still miles away from an ACC or Pac-12. But the inevitable trend toward growing commercialism, especially for the Ivy League, brings about several questions.
Will the Ivy League become just another heavily-sponsored athletic conference capitalizing on brand-name programs? How does this leave the future of non-profitable sports, especially when larger-sport booster programs may be providing an imbalance of support in terms of newer amenities and “perks”? Can we still preserve those weekend back-to-backs, the distinctiveness of hallowed facilities like Harvard Stadium or Whitney Payne Gymnasium, or the strange allure of long bus road trips in lieu of chartered flights?
Perhaps these concerns are jumping the gun. Perhaps it has something to do with the fear of normality that seems to seep into the Ivy League identity. Or the strange stubbornness to tradition that is a hallmark of the Ancient Eight (may I remind you: concentrations, not majors).
Overall however, I am optimistic, especially in light of recent investigations into the corruption within the NCAA, that the Ivy League can be a new trendsetter in redefining the relationship between money and college athletics. Just as it cemented the concept of amateurism in its founding years, the Ivy League should and can demonstrate that commercialism does not have to equate to jeopardizing the role of higher education itself: to create a welcoming environment for personal growth and education.
More concretely, this means that students should not have to play games starting past the 9 o’clock hour simply to sneak in a television time slot. Corporate sponsorships and larger media deals can be welcomed, but an expectation should be raised that coverage should reflect more than the raw athletic abilities of football and basketball players and that names like “Princeton” or “Harvard” be more than shiny badges of honor. Renovating the hockey weight room and selling merchandise at Lavietes Pavilion should be welcomed, but can we establish measures to ensure accountability in terms of support to say, women’s tennis equipment or baseball seating?
From a fan’s perspective, do the proper resources exist to ensure that all sports are readily accessible for viewing? The development of the Ivy League Network is a step in the right direction, but its rare subscription-based model and general lack of promotion leaves questions as to the logic behind a paywall system. With the announcement that the new ESPN+ will be featuring live coverage of Ivy League games, it may mean that watching a game requires a $4.99 monthly subscription. Here, what benefit does it serve to the overall college community?
As a writer for Crimson Sports, I must also acknowledge that we can do an improved job at diversifying our coverage and giving less-publicized sports their due recognition. The hope is that the Ivy League’s new commercial partners will also maintain a keen eye in respecting the Ivy tradition that still exists and balancing out their own marketing goals with those promoted by the university. In other words, let’s be conscious of what companies are advertising on our televised games, and let’s not bombard students who attend games with too many unnecessary flyers or corporate mementos.
To summarize, there should be a fine balance between allowing commercial partners to benefit programs, and for these companies to harm teams. The Ivy League can be a new trendsetter for corporate development and involvement. But students and student-athletes must come first.

After Meeting with Harvard Admin on ‘Swatting’ Attack, Black Student Leaders Say Demands Remain Unanswered
California loves its warm weather, clear waters, laid back lifestyle and maybe, above all else, its baseball.
At the start of the 2015 Major League Baseball season, there were twice as many California-born MLB players than athletes hailing from any other state in the nation. Almost as soon as they walk, kids are handed their first baseball glove and are sent out into the sun to fall in love with “America’s pastime.”
Perhaps it’s the influence of storied MLB franchises like the Los Angeles Angels, the San Francisco Giants, or the Los Angeles Dodgers. Perhaps it’s the easygoing culture of California aligning perfectly with the relaxed game that is baseball. Maybe it’s that California’s weather is conducive to year-round play. Some might say it’s a combination of all three that makes California the nation’s hotbed of baseball.
“There are a lot of good professional teams out there,” said junior first baseman Patrick McColl, a native of Los Altos, Calif. “It's kind of a year round thing, kids start playing travel ball when they’re really young. It’s obviously warm enough to do so.”
Other players agreed, citing the conducive nature of the state’s environment.
“I think it's just a big part of the weather which just influences the culture of baseball in California,”  said Los Gatos native and sophomore pitcher Hunter Bigge.
Weekends are filled with travel team baseball tournaments; parents drive their kids hours away just to attend practices during the week, satisfying their hunger for the game.
“Baseball was all I did,” Bigge said. “Before I got to high school, I’d play baseball every weekend. It always something I bonded with my friends over.”
The love and passion for baseball manifests in commitment and competition. Every Californian will say the atmosphere simply breeds talent.
“The baseball in California is extremely competitive,” said Moraga native and junior outfielder Ben Skinner. “There’s a lot of talent within that region. It's really a hotbed of talent.”
Moraga, Calif., is a two-day and 3,087 mile journey to Cambridge. Los Altos boasts a 3,130 mile trip and at 3,133 miles away Los Gatos is even further. Combine that with resort weather, top notch competition, and the “Cali” lifestyle, and you would not expect to find more than a few Californians on the Harvard baseball team. Before only a few years ago, the assumption match the state of the roster.
“When I came in my recruiting class, there was actually no one on the team before from California,” McColl said.
Now, the team is lined from top to bottom with Californians, 11 in fact. More than a third of the team calls California their home, while Yale and Princeton both claim only two players from the Golden State.
The Crimson has built this this new-look baseball team on the grounds of ambitious recruiting, a newfound chemistry, and the adoption of new playing styles.
Many of these kids did not have any plans of coming to Harvard, but they were given an offer they could not refuse: give up the warm weather of their home and gain the opportunity to continue playing competitive baseball coupled with an elite level education.
“Ivy Leagues weren’t even in the question,” Bigge said. “[They] were always kind of in the back of my mind. One of the coaches flew out to watch me play junior year, and they offered me a couple days later. I came to the realization that if Harvard offers you on the spot, you kind of have to take it. If baseball doesn't work out, nobody can take a Harvard degree away from you.”
The Crimson’s recent ability to venture across the country and create a presence in camps and showcases has made it a more coveted name in the baseball world on the West Coast.
“They saw me at a few different events…[first] in Stockton,” Skinner said. “Then they saw me again at Stanford Camp, and after that, I received my offer from Harvard, and I accepted that pretty quickly. I was extremely thankful and excited for that.”
Extending these offers to a new area has created a chain reaction in commitments. It started with five California players in the current junior class, followed by five more in the subsequent year. Now, even though California is on the other side of the country, the state’s players can now see a piece of home in Harvard.
“My roommate right now, we’re from the same town,” Bigge said. “We played travel ball together when we were 10 years old. It was nice having that hometown connection.”
Others have even used their connections at home for recruitment.
“I actually played on the same travel ball team as Hunter Bigge,” Skinner said. “ I knew him beforehand. He texted me before he made the decision to come to Harvard. I told him that I loved it and i’d be stoked to have him.”
However, simply having a few familiar faces was not enough to complete the transition to this side of the country. California has easy access to baseball facilities. Warm weather comes with batting cages in backyards and baseball fields that are always open for play.
Now they come to Harvard. Preseason practices take place on the football field, under a covered bubble to protect from frigid northeastern temperatures. The first couple months of the season are not even played in the Northeast. This season, the Crimson played its first 18 games on the road, no further north than South Carolina, while its home field was draped in snow.
“Once we got into the season it was definitely a big adjustment,” McColl said. “My first Ivy League game…it was about 35 degrees and it started sleeting. I was like, what did I get myself into? In the end, it turned out alright.”
The weather isn't the the only thing that requires adjustment. There is definitely a culture shock that comes with the transition to the Boston area. The city offers a fast paced atmosphere different from the chill California culture.
“It's definitely different coming from California,” said McColl, speaking on the change in atmosphere. “It's more slow paced out there [in California]. I think Boston in general is a different city. Part of the reason I wanted to come here was because I thought Boston was really cool when I came and visited.”
Nonetheless, the players have made this transition together, forming a bond over their California roots. Harvard has become their home away from home with so many players from the native area. Their common beginnings have built team chemistry that extends far past O’Donnell field. California players have become friends and even roommates.
“It made it a little bit easier,” McColl said. “I room with two other guys that are from California. We hang out when we’re at home now. It’s definitely a cool thing to have.”
Together, the players feel they offer not only a unique personality and background, but also a different brand of baseball. The Californian’s feel they bring the “West Coast” side of baseball to the team, which perfectly complements the East Coast style of play the team has benefited from in the past.
“The classic West Coast, East Coast difference,” Bigge said. “Georgia, Florida baseball is hit the ball as far as you can, and throw the ball as hard as you can. California is a lot more structured around hitting your spots on the mound, getting your bunts down, paying more attention to the skilled aspect of the game and doing the little things well. I’d agree there’s a lot of skill there.”
What Harvard has built is truly unique. The team is now full of talented players that hail from across the continent. Each brings their ability, personality, and piece of friendship that are all essential to the teams’ success.
With 11 Golden State natives on the roster, this chain of Californians may not end soon. Especially not with the current players taking on a larger role in the western recruiting.
“Kids from California are worried about coming out to the northeast to play baseball,” McColl said. “Know that it's not gonna be too much of a worry. It’s been a great experience overall.”

Dear Veritawkward,So I’ve been best friends with a girl in my grade since freshman year, but our relationship has always been strictly platonic. Last weekend her younger sister came to visit from [her college], and the two of us really hit it off. We spent a lot of time together since my friend would send her sister to hang out with me while she had class. On Saturday night we were all at a party together, and after my friend went home, her sister and I drunkenly hooked up. We waited a few days to tell my friend, and she was absolutely furious. She hasn’t talked to me since, and I really have no clue how to fix this. Should I try to talk to her again?Please help,Stumped by Sisters
Dear Stumped by Sisters,
When it comes to romance, there are a lot of “codes.” Girl code, guy code, friend code, you name it. Unfortunately for you, sibling code is probably the most strict. Think about it: these girls have literally known each other their entire lives. They’ve been through it all together, and that makes their bond pretty solid. It’s also likely that they’ve had some competition (with significant others, life, school) in the past, and this event could have stirred up old tensions.
Your friend (let’s call her Sister A) is definitely having some conflicting emotions. For starters, she’s probably feeling protective over her baby sister. That’s only natural. She could also be angry that you guys decided to keep this from her. Some candid advice? Never, ever keep something like that from a close friend. The outcome will only get worse the longer you wait.
Now, even if you were never romantically involved with Sister A, she could still be feeling some betrayal. You guys have been such close friends for so long, and she might be nervous that she could lose you to her sister. I’m guessing you guys have supported each other through a lot, and for her this situation could mean the loss of closeness with two people who are very important in her life. Additionally, Sister B came to visit Sister A. The fact that you two spent the majority of the weekend together was most likely annoying her, and this whole event was the last straw.
Long story short, this is a complex situation you’re tied up in. The good thing is, Sister B is back at college, and there won’t be any more drunken makeout seshs in the near future. My advice is to give Sister A the space she needs to cool off, process her emotions, and hash things out with her sister. Wait for her to approach you (and I can guarantee that she will soon), and just apologize for what happened, listen to what she has to say, and respect her feelings. After that, I’m sure you guys will be thick as thieves in no time.
Remember the codes,Veritawkward
Dear Veritawkward,My first girlfriend and I just broke up, and it’s given me some time to think. In retrospect, I realize that throughout the entire relationship I cared so much more than she did. Whether it was small things like delivering her favorite food after an exam and remembering her favorite songs, or bigger things like planning an elaborate treasure hunt for her birthday, I always seemed to be putting in more effort. When we broke up, I cried like a baby for days. I’m pretty sure she didn’t even shed a tear. I wish I had realized earlier that she was just not as committed so that I wouldn’t have gotten so hurt. I guess I just want some advice on how to not get too attached to a person that isn’t as dedicated. Are there signs to watch out for? I just really don’t want to let another a person hurt me this much again.Sincerely,Desperate to Detach
Dear Desperate to Detach,
First off, my condolences on the breakup. Whether you’re the dumper or the dumpee, breakups always suck, and can be some of the most emotionally draining events a person will experience. In the wake of heartbreak, it sounds like you’ve been doing a lot of post-romance reflection. That’s great! It’s always good to go back over a past relationship without those rose-colored glasses and really understand what wasn’t working.
Now, believe me, I get the whole “how do I guard my heart and stop myself from getting hurt?” thing. Anyone who’s recently felt the sting of rejection would naturally want to try to save themselves from future pain. However, by protecting your heart you run the risk of missing out on some really remarkable connections. While it’s definitely smart to err on the side of caution when deciding to open up so fully to someone, you don’t want to enter into the world already prepped for disaster. Be aware, not closed off.
This awareness should also be applied to your perception of the other person. Really try to see them for who they actually are, not who you want them to be. In the end, a relationship is a two way street. If you don’t feel like your S.O. is giving you what you want/need/deserve/desire, it might be time to reassess. If you guys aren’t on the same page about the nature of the relationship, that just means it isn’t the right match. There is someone out there right now who will check off all the boxes on your soulmate checklist, but cutting yourself off from the possibility of love and attachment isn’t the way to find them.
Stay strong,Veritawkward
